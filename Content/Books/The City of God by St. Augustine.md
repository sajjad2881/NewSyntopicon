editor's preface.

"rome having been stormed and sacked by the goths under alaric their [[king]],[1] the worshippers of false gods, or pagans, as we commonly call them, made an attempt to attribute this calamity to the [[christian]] [[religion]], and began to blaspheme the true [[god]] with even more than their wonted bitterness and acerbity. it was this which kindled my zeal for the house of [[god]], and prompted me to undertake the defence of the [[city]] of [[god]] against the charges and misrepresentations of its assailants. this [[work]] was in my hands for several years, owing to the interruptions occasioned by many other affairs which had a prior claim on my attention, and which i could not defer. however, this [[great]] undertaking was at [[last]] completed in twenty-two books [[book]]. of these, the first five refute those who fancy that the polytheistic [[worship]] is necessary in order to secure worldly [[prosperity]], and that all these overwhelming calamities have befallen us in consequence of its prohibition. in the following five books [[book]] i address myself to those who admit that such calamities have at all times [[time]] attended, and will at all times [[time]] attend, the [[human]] [[race]], and that they constantly recur in forms more or less disastrous, varying only in the scenes, occasions [[occasion]], and persons [[person]] on whom they [[light]], but, while admitting this, maintain that the [[worship]] of the gods is advantageous for the [[life]] to come. in these ten books [[book]], then, i refute these two opinions [[opinion]], which are as groundless as they are antagonistic to the [[christian]] [[religion]].

"but that no one might have [[occasion]] to say, that though i had refuted the tenets of other [[men]], i had omitted to establish my own, i devote to this object the second part of[pg viii] this [[work]], which comprises twelve books [[book]], although i have not scrupled, as [[occasion]] offered, either to advance my own opinions [[opinion]] in the first ten books [[book]], or to demolish the arguments of my opponents in the [[last]] twelve. of these twelve books [[book]], the first four contain an account of the origin of these two cities—the [[city]] of [[god]], and the [[city]] of the [[world]]. the second four treat of their [[history]] or [[progress]]; the third and [[last]] four, of their deserved destinies. and so, though all these twenty-two books [[book]] refer to both cities [[city]], yet i have named them after the [[better]] [[city]], and called them the [[city]] of [[god]]."

such is the account given by augustine himself[2] of the [[occasion]] and plan of this his [[greatest]] [[work]]. but in addition to this explicit information, we learn from the correspondence[3] of augustine, that it was due to the importunity of his friend marcellinus that this defence of [[christianity]] extended beyond the limits of a few letters. shortly before the fall of [[rome]], marcellinus had been sent to [[africa]] by the [[emperor]] honorius to arrange a settlement of the differences between the donatists and the catholics. this brought him into contact not only with augustine, but with volusian, the proconsul of [[africa]], and a [[man]] of rare [[intelligence]] and candour. finding that volusian, though as yet a pagan, took an interest in the [[christian]] [[religion]], marcellinus set his [[heart]] on converting him to the true [[faith]]. the details of the subsequent significant intercourse between the learned and courtly bishop and the two imperial statesmen, are unfortunately almost entirely lost to us; but the impression conveyed by the extant correspondence is, that marcellinus was the means of bringing his two [[friends]] into communication with one another. the first overture was on augustine's part, in the shape of a simple and manly request that volusian would carefully peruse the scriptures [[scripture]], accompanied by a frank offer to do his [[best]] to solve any difficulties that might arise in such a course of inquiry. volusian accordingly enters into correspondence with augustine; and in order to illustrate the [[kind]] of difficulties experienced by [[men]] in his position, he gives some graphic notes of a conversation in which he had recently[pg ix] taken part at a gathering of some of his [[friends]]. the difficulty to which most weight is attached in this letter, is the apparent impossibility of believing in the incarnation. but a letter which marcellinus immediately despatched to augustine, urging him to reply to volusian at large, brought the [[intelligence]] that the difficulties and objections to [[christianity]] were thus limited merely out of a courteous regard to the preciousness of the bishop's [[time]], and the vast number of his engagements. this letter, in short, brought out the important [[fact]], that a removal of speculative doubts [[doubt]] would not suffice for the conversion of such [[men]] as volusian, whose [[life]] was one with the [[life]] of the [[empire]]. their difficulties were rather [[political]], historical, and social. they could not see how the reception of the [[christian]] [[rule]] of [[life]] was compatible with the interests of [[rome]] as the mistress of the [[world]].[4] and thus augustine was [[led]] to take a more distinct and wider view of the whole relation which [[christianity]] bore to the old [[state]] of things,—moral, [[political]], philosophical, and [[religious]],—and was gradually drawn on to undertake the elaborate [[work]] now presented to the english reader, and which may more appropriately than any other of his writings be called his masterpiece[5] or life-work. it was begun the very year of marcellinus' [[death]], a.d. 413, and was issued in detached portions from [[time]] to [[time]], until its completion in the year 426. it thus occupied the maturest years of augustine's life—from his fifty-ninth to his seventy-second year.[6]

from this brief sketch, it will be seen that though the accompanying [[work]] is essentially an apology, the apologetic of augustine can be no mere rehabilitation of the somewhat threadbare, if not effete, arguments of justin and tertullian.[7] in [[fact]], as augustine considered what was required of him,—to expound the [[christian]] [[faith]], and justify it to enlightened[pg x] [[men]]; to distinguish it from, and show its superiority to, all those forms of [[truth]], philosophical or popular, which were then striving for the mastery, or at least for standing-room; to set before the world's eye a vision of [[glory]] that might [[win]] the regard even of [[men]] who were dazzled by the fascinating splendour of a world-wide [[empire]],—he recognised that a task was laid before him to which even his powers [[power]] might prove unequal,—a task certainly which would afford ample scope for his learning, dialectic, philosophical grasp and acumen, eloquence, and faculty of exposition.

but it is the [[occasion]] of this [[great]] apology which invests it at once with grandeur and vitality. after more than eleven hundred years of steady and triumphant [[progress]], [[rome]] had been taken and sacked. it is difficult for us to appreciate, impossible to overestimate, the shock which was thus communicated from centre to circumference of the whole known [[world]]. it was generally believed, not only by the heathen, but also by many of the most liberal-minded of the christians [[christian]], that the destruction of [[rome]] would be the prelude to the destruction of the [[world]].[8] even jerome, who might have been supposed to be embittered against the proud mistress of the [[world]] by her inhospitality to himself, cannot conceal his profound emotion on hearing of her fall. "a terrible rumour," he says, "reaches me from the west, telling of [[rome]] besieged, bought for gold, besieged again, [[life]] and [[property]] perishing together. my voice falters, sobs stifle the words i dictate; for she is a captive, that [[city]] which enthralled the [[world]]."[9] augustine is never so theatrical as jerome in the expression of his feeling, but he is equally explicit in lamenting the fall of [[rome]] as a [[great]] calamity; and while he does not scruple to ascribe her recent disgrace to the profligate[pg xi] manners, the effeminacy, and the [[pride]] of her [[citizens]], he is not without [[hope]] that, by a return to the simple, hardy, and honourable mode of [[life]] which characterized the early romans, she may still be restored to much of her former [[prosperity]].[10] but as augustine contemplates the ruins of rome's greatness, and feels [[feel]], in [[common]] with all the [[world]] at this crisis, the instability of the strongest governments [[government]], the insufficiency of the most authoritative statesmanship, there hovers over these ruins the splendid vision of the [[city]] of [[god]] "coming down out of [[heaven]], adorned as a bride for her husband." the old social [[system]] is crumbling away on all sides, but in its place he seems to see a pure christendom arising. he sees that [[human]] [[history]] and [[human]] [[destiny]] are not wholly identified with the [[history]] of any earthly power—not though it be as cosmopolitan as the [[empire]] of [[rome]].[11] he directs the attention of [[men]] to the [[fact]] that there is another [[kingdom]] on [[earth]],—a [[city]] which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is [[god]]. he teaches [[teach]] [[men]] to take profounder views of [[history]], and shows them how from the first the [[city]] of [[god]], or [[community]] of god's [[people]], has lived alongside of the kingdoms [[kingdom]] of this [[world]] and their [[glory]], and has been silently increasing, "crescit occulto velut arbor ævo." he demonstrates that the superior morality, the true doctrine, the heavenly origin of this [[city]], ensure its [[success]]; and over against this, he depicts the silly or contradictory theorizings of the pagan [[philosophers]], and the unhinged morals [[moral]] of the [[people]], and puts it to all candid [[men]] to say, whether in the presence of so manifestly sufficient a cause for rome's downfall, there is room for imputing it to the spread of [[christianity]]. he traces the antagonism of these two grand communities [[community]] of [[rational]] creatures, back to their first divergence in the fall of the angels, and down to the consummation of all things in the [[last]] [[judgment]] and eternal destination of the [[good]] and [[evil]]. in other words, the [[city]] of [[god]] is "the first real effort to [[produce]] a [[philosophy]] of [[history]],"[12] to exhibit historical[pg xii] events in connection with their true causes, and in their real sequence. this plan of the [[work]] is not only a [[great]] conception, but it is accompanied with many practical advantages; the [[chief]] of which is, that it admits, and even requires, a full treatment of those doctrines of our [[faith]] that are more directly historical,—the doctrines of creation, the fall, the incarnation, the connection between the old and new testaments, and the doctrine of "the [[last]] things."[13]

the effect produced by this [[great]] [[work]] it is impossible to determine with accuracy. beugnot, with an absoluteness which we should condemn as presumption in any less competent [[authority]], declares that its effect can only have been very slight.[14] probably its effect would be silent and slow; telling first upon cultivated minds [[mind]], and only indirectly upon the [[people]]. certainly its effect must have been weakened by the interrupted manner of its publication. it is an easier task to estimate its intrinsic value. but on this also patristic and literary authorities [[authority]] widely differ. dupin admits that it is very pleasant reading, owing to the surprising variety of matters which are introduced to illustrate and forward the argument, but censures the author for discussing very useless questions [[question]], and for adducing reasons [[reason]] which could satisfy no one who was not already convinced.[15] huet also speaks of the [[book]] as "un amas confus d'excellents materiaux; c'est de l'or en barre et en lingots."[16] l'abbé flottes censures these opinions [[opinion]] as [[unjust]], and cites with approbation the unqualified eulogy of pressensé.[17] but probably the popularity of the [[book]] is its [[best]] justification. this popularity may be measured by the circumstance that, between the year 1467 and the end of the fifteenth century, no fewer than twenty[pg xiii] editions were called for, that is to say, a fresh edition every eighteen months.[18] and in the interesting series of letters that passed between ludovicus vives and erasmus, who had engaged him to write a commentary on the [[city]] of [[god]] for his edition of augustine's works [[work]], we find vives pleading for a separate edition of this [[work]], on the plea that, of all the writings of augustine, it was almost the only one [[read]] by patristic students, and might therefore naturally be expected to have a much wider circulation.[19]

if it were [[asked]] to what this popularity is due, we should be disposed to attribute it mainly to the [[great]] variety of ideas [[idea]], opinions [[opinion]], and facts [[fact]] that are here brought before the reader's [[mind]]. its importance as a contribution to the [[history]] of [[opinion]] cannot be overrated. we find in it not only indications or explicit enouncement of the author's own views upon almost every important topic which occupied his thoughts [[thought]], but also a compendious exhibition of the ideas [[idea]] which most powerfully influenced the [[life]] of that [[age]]. it thus becomes, as poujoulat says, "comme l'encyclopédie du cinquième siècle." all that is valuable, together with much indeed that is not so, in the [[religion]] and [[philosophy]] of the classical nations of antiquity, is reviewed. and on some branches of these subjects [[subject]] it has, in the [[judgment]] of one well qualified to [[judge]], "preserved more than the whole surviving latin literature." it is true we are sometimes wearied by the too elaborate refutation of opinions [[opinion]] which to a [[modern]] [[mind]] seem self-evident absurdities; but if these opinions [[opinion]] were actually prevalent in the fifth century, the historical inquirer will not quarrel with the form in which his information is conveyed, nor will commit the absurdity of attributing to augustine the foolishness of these opinions [[opinion]], but rather the credit of exploding them. that augustine is a well-informed and impartial[pg xiv] critic, is evinced by the courteousness and candour which he uniformly displays to his opponents, by the [[respect]] he won from the heathen themselves, and by his own early [[life]]. the most rigorous criticism has found him at [[fault]] regarding matters of [[fact]] only in some very rare instances, which can be easily accounted for. his learning would not indeed stand comparison with what is accounted such in our day: his [[life]] was too busy, and too devoted to the [[poor]] and to the spiritually necessitous, to admit of any extraordinary acquisition. he had access to no literature but the latin; or at least he had only sufficient [[greek]] to enable him to refer to [[greek]] authors on points of importance, and not enough to enable him to [[read]] their writings with ease and [[pleasure]].[20] but he had a profound [[knowledge]] of his own [[time]], and a familiar acquaintance not only with the latin poets, but with many other authors, some of whose writings are now lost to us, save the fragments preserved through his quotations.

but the interest attaching to the [[city]] of [[god]] is not merely historical. it is the earnestness and ability with which he developes his own philosophical and theological views which gradually fascinate the reader, and make him see why the [[world]] has set this among the few [[greatest]] books [[book]] of all [[time]]. the fundamental lines of the augustinian theology are here laid down in a comprehensive and interesting form. never was [[thought]] so abstract expressed in [[language]] so popular. he handles metaphysical problems with the unembarrassed ease of [[plato]], with all cicero's accuracy and acuteness, and more than cicero's profundity. he is never more at [[home]] than when exposing the incompetency of neoplatonism, or demonstrating the harmony of [[christian]] doctrine and true [[philosophy]]. and though there are in the [[city]] of [[god]], as in all ancient books [[book]], things that seem to us childish and barren, there are also the most surprising anticipations of [[modern]] speculation. there is an earnest grappling with those problems which are continually re-opened because they underlie man's [[man]] relation to [[god]] and the [[spiritual]] [[world]],—the[pg xv] problems which are not peculiar to any one century. as we [[read]] these animated discussions,

"the fourteen centuries fall away between us and the afric saint, and at his side we urge, to-day, the immemorial quest and old complaint.

no outward sign to us is given, from sea or [[earth]] comes no reply; hushed as the warm numidian [[heaven]] he vainly questioned bends our frozen [[sky]]."

it is true, the style of the [[book]] is not all that could be [[desired]]: there are passages which can possess an interest only to the antiquarian; there are others with nothing to redeem them but the glow of their eloquence; there are many repetitions; there is an occasional use of arguments "plus ingenieux que solides," as m. saisset says. augustine's [[great]] admirer, erasmus, does not scruple to call him a writer "obscuræ subtilitatis et parum amœnæ prolixitatis;"[21] but "the toil of penetrating the apparent obscurities will be rewarded by finding a real [[wealth]] of insight and enlightenment." some who have [[read]] the opening chapters [[chapter]] of the [[city]] of [[god]], may have considered it would be a waste of [[time]] to proceed; but no one, we are persuaded, ever regretted reading it all. the [[book]] has its faults [[fault]]; but it effectually introduces us to the most influential of theologians, and the [[greatest]] popular teacher; to a genius that cannot nod for many lines together; to a reasoner whose dialectic is more formidable, more keen and sifting, than that of [[socrates]] or aquinas; to a saint whose ardent and [[genuine]] devotional feeling bursts up through the severest argumentation; to a [[man]] whose kindliness and wit, universal sympathies and breadth of [[intelligence]], lend piquancy and vitality to the most abstract dissertation.

the propriety of publishing a translation of so [[choice]] a specimen of ancient literature needs no defence. as poujoulat very sensibly remarks, there are not a [[great]] many [[men]] now-a-days who will [[read]] a [[work]] in latin of twenty-two books [[book]]. perhaps there are fewer still who ought to do so. with our busy neighbours in [[france]], this [[work]] has been a[pg xvi] prime favourite for 400 years. there may be said to be eight independent translations of it into the french tongue, though some of these are in part merely revisions. one of these translations has gone through as many as four editions. the most recent is that which forms part of the nisard series; but the [[best]], so far as we have seen, is that of the accomplished professor of [[philosophy]] in the college of [[france]], emile saisset. this translation is indeed all that can be [[desired]]: here and there an omission occurs, and about one or two renderings a difference of [[opinion]] may [[exist]]; but the exceeding felicity and spirit of the whole show it to have been a [[labour]] of [[love]], the fond homage of a disciple proud of his master. the preface of m. saisset is one of the most valuable contributions ever made to the understanding of augustine's [[philosophy]].[22]

of english translations there has been an unaccountable [[poverty]]. only one exists,[23] and this so exceptionally [[bad]], so unlike the racy translations of the seventeenth century in general, so inaccurate, and so frequently unintelligible, that it is not impossible it may have done something towards giving the english [[public]] a distaste for the [[book]] itself. that the [[present]] translation also might be improved, we [[know]]; that many [[men]] were fitter for the task, on the score of scholarship, we are very sensible; but that any one would have executed it with intenser affection and veneration for the author, we are not prepared to admit. a few notes have been added where it appeared to be necessary. some are original, some from the benedictine augustine, and the rest from the elaborate commentary of vives.[24]

the [[city]] of [[god]].

book first.

argument.

augustine censures the pagans, who attributed the calamities of the [[world]], and especially the recent sack of [[rome]] by the goths, to the [[christian]] [[religion]], and its prohibition of the [[worship]] of the gods. he speaks of the blessings and ills of [[life]], which then, as always, happened to [[good]] and [[bad]] [[men]] alike. finally, he rebukes the shamelessness of those who cast up to the christians [[christian]] that their [[women]] had been violated by the soldiers.

preface, explaining his design in undertaking this [[work]].

the glorious [[city]] of [[god]] is my theme in this [[work]], which you, my dearest [[son]] marcellinus,[25] suggested, and which is due to you by my promise. i have undertaken its defence against those who prefer their own gods to the founder of this [[city]],—a [[city]] surpassingly glorious, whether we view it as it still lives [[life]] by [[faith]] in this fleeting course of [[time]], and sojourns as a stranger in the midst of the ungodly, or as it shall dwell in the fixed stability of its eternal seat, which it now with patience waits for, expecting until "righteousness shall return unto [[judgment]],"[26] and it obtain, by [[virtue]] of its excellence, final [[victory]] and [[perfect]] [[peace]]. a [[great]] [[work]] this, and an arduous; but [[god]] is my helper. for i am aware what ability is requisite to persuade the proud how [[great]] is the [[virtue]] of [[humility]], which raises us, not by a quite [[human]] arrogance, but by a [[divine]] grace, above all earthly dignities that totter on this shifting scene. for the [[king]] and founder[pg 2] of this [[city]] of which we speak, has in [[scripture]] uttered to his [[people]] a dictum of the [[divine]] [[law]] in these words: "god resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."[27] but this, which is god's prerogative, the inflated [[ambition]] of a proud spirit also affects, and dearly loves [[love]] that this be numbered among its attributes, to

"show [[pity]] to the humbled [[soul]], and crush the sons [[son]] of [[pride]]."[28]
and therefore, as the plan of this [[work]] we have undertaken requires, and as [[occasion]] offers, we must speak also of the earthly [[city]], which, though it be mistress of the nations, is itself ruled by its [[lust]] of [[rule]].

1. of the adversaries of the name of [[christ]], whom the barbarians for christ's sake spared when they stormed the [[city]].

for to this earthly [[city]] belong the enemies [[enemy]] against whom i have to defend the [[city]] of [[god]]. many of them, indeed, being reclaimed from their ungodly error, have become sufficiently creditable [[citizens]] of this [[city]]; but many are so inflamed with [[hatred]] against it, and are so ungrateful to its redeemer for his signal benefits, as to forget that they would now be unable to utter a [[single]] word to its prejudice, had they not found in its [[sacred]] places, as they fled from the enemy's steel, that [[life]] in which they now boast themselves. are not those very romans, who were spared by the barbarians through their [[respect]] for [[christ]], become enemies [[enemy]] to the name of [[christ]]? the reliquaries of the martyrs and the churches [[church]] of the [[apostles]] bear witness to this; for in the sack of the [[city]] they were open sanctuary for all who fled to them, whether [[christian]] or pagan. to their very threshold the bloodthirsty [[enemy]] raged; there his murderous fury owned a limit. thither did such of the [[enemy]] as had any [[pity]] convey those to whom they had given quarter, lest any less mercifully disposed might fall upon them. and, indeed, when even those murderers who everywhere else showed themselves pitiless came to these spots where that was forbidden which the licence of [[war]] permitted in every other place, their furious rage for slaughter was bridled, and their eagerness to take prisoners [[prisoner]] was quenched. thus escaped multitudes who now reproach[pg 3] the [[christian]] [[religion]], and impute to [[christ]] the ills that have befallen their [[city]]; but the preservation of their own life—a boon which they owe to the [[respect]] entertained for [[christ]] by the barbarians—they attribute not to our [[christ]], but to their own [[good]] [[luck]]. they ought rather, had they any [[right]] perceptions, to attribute the severities and hardships inflicted by their enemies [[enemy]], to that [[divine]] providence which is wont to reform the depraved manners of [[men]] by chastisement, and which exercises with similar afflictions the righteous and praiseworthy,—either translating them, when they have passed through the [[trial]], to a [[better]] [[world]], or detaining them still on [[earth]] for ulterior purposes [[purpose]]. and they ought to attribute it to the spirit of these [[christian]] times [[time]], that, contrary to the custom of [[war]], these bloodthirsty barbarians spared them, and spared them for christ's sake, whether this [[mercy]] was actually shown in promiscuous places, or in those places specially dedicated to christ's name, and of which the very largest were selected as sanctuaries, that full scope might thus be given to the expansive compassion which [[desired]] that a large multitude might find shelter there. therefore ought they to give [[god]] thanks, and with sincere [[confession]] flee for refuge to his name, that so they may escape the [[punishment]] of eternal fire—they who with lying lips took upon them this name, that they might escape the [[punishment]] of [[present]] destruction. for of those whom you see insolently and shamelessly insulting the servants of [[christ]], there are numbers who would not have escaped that destruction and slaughter had they not pretended that they themselves were christ's servants. yet now, in ungrateful [[pride]] and most impious madness, and at the risk of being punished in everlasting darkness, they perversely oppose that name under which they fraudulently protected themselves for the sake of enjoying the [[light]] of this brief [[life]].

2. that it is quite contrary to the usage of [[war]], that the victors should spare the vanquished for the sake of their gods.

there are histories [[history]] of numberless wars [[war]], both before the building of [[rome]] and since its rise and the extension of its dominion: let these be [[read]], and let one instance be cited in which, when a [[city]] had been taken by foreigners, the victors[pg 4] spared those who were found to have fled for sanctuary to the temples of their gods;[29] or one instance in which a barbarian general gave orders that none should be put to the [[sword]] who had been found in this or that temple. did not æneas see

"dying priam at the shrine, staining the hearth he made [[divine]]?"[30]
did not diomede and ulysses

"drag with red hands, the sentry slain, her fateful image from your fane, her chaste locks touch, and stain with gore the virgin coronal she wore?"[31]
neither is that true which follows, that

"thenceforth the tide of [[fortune]] changed, and greece grew [[weak]]."[32]
for after this they conquered and destroyed troy with [[fire]] and [[sword]]; after this they beheaded priam as he fled to the altars. neither did troy perish because it lost minerva. for what had minerva herself first lost, that she should perish? her guards perhaps? no [[doubt]]; just her guards. for as soon as they were slain, she could be stolen. it was not, in [[fact]], the [[men]] who were preserved by the image, but the image by the [[men]]. how, then, was she invoked to defend the [[city]] and the [[citizens]], she who could not defend her own defenders?

3. that the romans did not show their usual sagacity when they trusted that they would be benefited by the gods who had been unable to defend troy.

and these be the gods to whose protecting [[care]] the romans were delighted to entrust their city! o too, too piteous mistake! and they are enraged at us when we speak thus about their gods, though, so far from being enraged at their own writers, they part with [[money]] to learn what they say; and, indeed, the very teachers of these authors are reckoned worthy of a salary from the [[public]] purse, and of other honours [[honour]]. there is [[virgil]], who is [[read]] by boys, in order that this [[great]] poet, this most famous and approved of all[pg 5] poets, may impregnate their virgin minds [[mind]], and may not readily be forgotten by them, according to that saying of horace,

"the fresh cask long keeps its first tang."[33]
well, in this [[virgil]], i say, juno is introduced as hostile to the trojans, and stirring up æolus, the [[king]] of the winds, against them in the words,

"a [[race]] i hate now ploughs the sea, transporting troy to [[italy]], and home-gods conquered. "[34]...
and ought prudent [[men]] to have entrusted the defence of [[rome]] to these conquered gods? but it will be said, this was only the saying of juno, who, like an angry woman, did not [[know]] what she was saying. what, then, says æneas himself,—æneas who is so often designated "pious?" does he not say,

"lo! panthus, 'scaped from [[death]] by flight, [[priest]] of [[apollo]] on the height, his conquered gods with trembling hands he bears, and shelter swift demands?"[35]
is it not clear that the gods (whom he does not scruple to call "conquered") were rather entrusted to æneas than he to them, when it is said to him,

"the gods of her domestic shrines your [[country]] to your [[care]] consigns?"[36]
if, then, [[virgil]] says that the gods were such as these, and were conquered, and that when conquered they could not escape except under the protection of a [[man]], what madness is it to suppose that [[rome]] had been wisely entrusted to these guardians, and could not have been taken unless it had lost them! indeed, to [[worship]] conquered gods as protectors and champions, what is this but to [[worship]], not [[good]] divinities, but [[evil]] omens?[37] would it not be wiser to [[believe]], not that [[rome]] would never have fallen into so [[great]] a calamity had not they first perished, but rather that they would have perished long since had not [[rome]] preserved them as long as she could? for who does not see, when he thinks [[think]] of it, what a foolish assumption it is that they could not be vanquished under vanquished defenders, and that they only perished[pg 6] because they had lost their guardian gods, when, indeed, the only cause of their perishing was that they chose for their protectors gods condemned to perish? the poets, therefore, when they composed and sang these things about the conquered gods, had no intention to invent falsehoods, but uttered, as honest [[men]], what the [[truth]] extorted from them. this, however, will be carefully and copiously discussed in another and more fitting place. meanwhile i will briefly, and to the [[best]] of my ability, explain what i meant to say about these ungrateful [[men]] who blasphemously impute to [[christ]] the calamities which they deservedly suffer in consequence of their own wicked ways, while that which is for christ's sake spared them in spite of their wickedness they do not even take the trouble to notice; and in their mad and blasphemous insolence, they use against his name those very lips wherewith they falsely claimed that same name that their lives [[life]] might be spared. in the places consecrated to [[christ]], where for his sake no [[enemy]] would injure them, they restrained their tongues that they might be safe and protected; but no sooner do they emerge from these sanctuaries, than they unbridle these tongues to hurl against him curses full of hate.

4. of the asylum of juno in troy, which saved no one from the greeks [[greek]]; and of the churches [[church]] of the [[apostles]], which protected from the barbarians all who fled to them.

troy itself, the [[mother]] of the roman [[people]], was not able, as i have said, to [[protect]] its own [[citizens]] in the [[sacred]] places of their gods from the [[fire]] and [[sword]] of the greeks [[greek]], though the greeks [[greek]] worshipped the same gods. not only so, but

"phœnix and [[ulysses]] fell in the void courts by juno's cell were set the spoil to keep; snatched from the burning shrines away, there ilium's mighty treasure lay, [[rich]] altars, bowls of massy gold, and captive raiment, rudely rolled in one promiscuous heap; while boys and matrons, wild with [[fear]], in long array were standing near."[38]
in other words, the place consecrated to so [[great]] a goddess[pg 7] was chosen, not that from it none might be [[led]] out a captive, but that in it all the captives might be immured. compare now this "asylum"—the asylum not of an ordinary [[god]], not of one of the rank and file of gods, but of jove's own sister and [[wife]], the queen of all the gods—with the churches [[church]] built in memory of the [[apostles]]. into it were collected the spoils rescued from the blazing temples and snatched from the gods, not that they might be restored to the vanquished, but divided among the victors; while into these was carried back, with the most [[religious]] observance and [[respect]], everything which belonged to them, even though found elsewhere. there [[liberty]] was lost; here preserved. there bondage was strict; here strictly excluded. into that temple [[men]] were driven to become the chattels of their enemies [[enemy]], now lording it over them; into these churches [[church]] [[men]] were [[led]] by their relenting foes, that they might be at [[liberty]]. in fine, the gentle[39] greeks [[greek]] appropriated that temple of juno to the purposes [[purpose]] of their own avarice and [[pride]]; while these churches [[church]] of [[christ]] were chosen even by the savage barbarians as the fit scenes for [[humility]] and [[mercy]]. but perhaps, after all, the greeks [[greek]] did in that [[victory]] of theirs spare the temples of those gods whom they worshipped in [[common]] with the trojans, and did not dare to put to the [[sword]] or make captive the wretched and vanquished trojans who fled thither; and perhaps [[virgil]], in the manner of poets, has depicted what never really happened? but there is no [[question]] that he depicted the usual custom of an [[enemy]] when sacking a [[city]].

5. cæsar's statement regarding the universal custom of an [[enemy]] when sacking a [[city]].

even cæsar himself gives us positive testimony regarding this custom; for, in his deliverance in the senate about the conspirators, he says (as sallust, a historian of distinguished veracity, writes[40]) "that virgins and boys are violated, [[children]] torn from the embrace of their parents, matrons subjected to[pg 8] whatever should be the [[pleasure]] of the conquerors, temples and houses plundered, slaughter and burning rife; in fine, all things filled with arms, corpses, [[blood]], and wailing." if he had not mentioned temples here, we might suppose that enemies [[enemy]] were in the habit of sparing the dwellings of the gods. and the roman temples were in danger of these disasters, not from [[foreign]] foes, but from catiline and his associates, the most [[noble]] senators and [[citizens]] of [[rome]]. but these, it may be said, were abandoned [[men]], and the parricides of their fatherland.

6. that not even the romans, when they took cities [[city]], spared the conquered in their temples.

why, then, need our argument take note of the many nations who have waged wars [[war]] with one another, and have nowhere spared the conquered in the temples of their gods? let us look at the practice of the romans themselves: let us, i say, recall and review the romans, whose [[chief]] [[praise]] it has been "to spare the vanquished and subdue the proud," and that they preferred "rather to [[forgive]] than to [[revenge]] an injury;"[41] and among so many and [[great]] cities [[city]] which they have stormed, taken, and overthrown for the extension of their dominion, let us be told what temples they were accustomed to exempt, so that whoever took refuge in them was [[free]]. or have they really done this, and has the [[fact]] been suppressed by the historians of these events? is it to be believed, that [[men]] who sought out with the [[greatest]] eagerness points they could [[praise]], would omit those which, in their own estimation, are the most signal proofs of piety? marcus marcellus, a distinguished roman, who took syracuse, a most splendidly adorned [[city]], is reported to have bewailed its coming ruin, and to have shed his own tears over it before he spilt its [[blood]]. he took steps also to preserve the chastity even of his [[enemy]]. for before he gave orders for the storming of the [[city]], he issued an edict forbidding the violation of any [[free]] [[person]]. yet the [[city]] was sacked according to the custom of [[war]]; nor do we anywhere [[read]], that even by so chaste and gentle a commander orders were given that no one should be injured who had fled to this or that temple.[pg 9] and this certainly would by no means have been omitted, when neither his weeping nor his edict preservative of chastity could be passed in [[silence]]. fabius, the conqueror of the [[city]] of tarentum, is praised for abstaining from making booty of the images. for when his secretary proposed the [[question]] to him, what he wished done with the statues of the gods, which had been taken in large numbers, he veiled his moderation under a joke. for he [[asked]] of what sort they were; and when they reported to him that there were not only many large images, but some of them armed, "oh," says he, "let us leave with the tarentines their angry gods." seeing, then, that the writers of roman [[history]] could not pass in [[silence]], neither the weeping of the one general nor the laughing of the other, neither the chaste [[pity]] of the one nor the facetious moderation of the other, on what [[occasion]] would it be omitted, if, for the [[honour]] of any of their enemy's gods, they had shown this particular form of leniency, that in any temple slaughter or captivity was prohibited?

7. that the cruelties which occurred in the sack of [[rome]] were in accordance with the custom of [[war]], whereas the acts of clemency resulted from the influence of christ's name.

all the spoiling, then, which [[rome]] was exposed to in the recent calamity—all the slaughter, plundering, burning, and misery—was the result of the custom of [[war]]. but what was novel, was that savage barbarians showed themselves in so gentle a guise, that the largest churches [[church]] were chosen and set apart for the [[purpose]] of being filled with the [[people]] to whom quarter was given, and that in them none were slain, from them none forcibly dragged; that into them many were [[led]] by their relenting enemies [[enemy]] to be set at [[liberty]], and that from them none were [[led]] into [[slavery]] by merciless foes. whoever does not see that this is to be attributed to the name of [[christ]], and to the [[christian]] temper, is blind; whoever sees this, and gives no [[praise]], is ungrateful; whoever hinders any one from praising it, is mad. far be it from any prudent [[man]] to impute this clemency to the barbarians. their fierce and bloody minds [[mind]] were awed, and bridled, and marvellously tempered by him who so long before said by his [[prophet]], "i[pg 10] will visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquities with stripes; nevertheless my loving-kindness will i not utterly take from them."[42]

8. of the advantages and disadvantages which often indiscriminately accrue to [[good]] and wicked [[men]].

will some one say, why, then, was this [[divine]] compassion extended even to the ungodly and ungrateful? why, but because it was the [[mercy]] of him who daily "maketh his sun to rise on the [[evil]] and on the [[good]], and sendeth rain on the just and on the [[unjust]]."[43] for though some of these [[men]], taking [[thought]] of this, repent of their wickedness and reform, some, as the apostle says, "despising the riches [[rich]] of his goodness and long-suffering, after their hardness and impenitent [[heart]], treasure up unto themselves wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous [[judgment]] of [[god]], who will render to every [[man]] according to his deeds:"[44] nevertheless does the patience of [[god]] still invite the wicked to repentance, even as the scourge of [[god]] educates the [[good]] to patience. and so, too, does the [[mercy]] of [[god]] embrace the [[good]] that it may cherish them, as the severity of [[god]] arrests the wicked to punish them. to the [[divine]] providence it has seemed [[good]] to prepare in the [[world]] to come for the righteous [[good]] things, which the unrighteous shall not enjoy; and for the wicked [[evil]] things, by which the [[good]] shall not be tormented. but as for the [[good]] things of this [[life]], and its ills, [[god]] has willed that these should be [[common]] to both; that we might not too eagerly covet the things which wicked [[men]] are seen equally to enjoy, nor shrink with an unseemly [[fear]] from the ills which even [[good]] [[men]] often suffer.

there is, too, a very [[great]] difference in the [[purpose]] served both by those events which we call adverse and those called prosperous. for the [[good]] [[man]] is neither uplifted with the [[good]] things of [[time]], nor broken by its ills; but the wicked [[man]], because he is corrupted by this world's [[happiness]], feels [[feel]] himself punished by its unhappiness.[45] yet often, even in the[pg 11] [[present]] distribution of temporal things, does [[god]] plainly evince his own interference. for if every [[sin]] were now visited with manifest [[punishment]], nothing would seem to be reserved for the final [[judgment]]; on the other hand, if no [[sin]] received now a plainly [[divine]] [[punishment]], it would be concluded that there is no [[divine]] providence at all. and so of the [[good]] things of this [[life]]: if [[god]] did not by a very visible liberality confer these on some of those persons [[person]] who ask for them, we should say that these [[good]] things were not at his disposal; and if he gave them to all who sought them, we should suppose that such were the only rewards [[reward]] of his service; and such a service would make us not godly, but greedy rather, and covetous. wherefore, though [[good]] and [[bad]] [[men]] suffer alike, we must not suppose that there is no difference between the [[men]] themselves, because there is no difference in what they both suffer. for even in the likeness of the sufferings, there remains an unlikeness in the sufferers; and though exposed to the same anguish, [[virtue]] and [[vice]] are not the same thing. for as the same [[fire]] causes gold to glow brightly, and chaff to smoke; and under the same flail the straw is beaten small, while the grain is cleansed; and as the lees are not mixed with the [[oil]], though squeezed out of the vat by the same pressure, so the same [[violence]] of affliction proves, purges, clarifies the [[good]], but damns, ruins, exterminates the wicked. and thus it is that in the same affliction the wicked detest [[god]] and blaspheme, while the [[good]] [[pray]] and [[praise]]. so material a difference does it make, not what ills are [[suffered]], but what [[kind]] of [[man]] suffers them. for, stirred up with the same movement, mud exhales a horrible stench, and ointment emits a fragrant odour.

9. of the reasons [[reason]] for administering correction to [[bad]] and [[good]] together.

what, then, have the christians [[christian]] [[suffered]] in that calamitous period, which would not [[profit]] every one who duly and faithfully considered the following circumstances? first of all, they must humbly consider those very sins [[sin]] which have provoked [[god]] to fill the [[world]] with such terrible disasters; for although they be far from the excesses of wicked, immoral, and ungodly [[men]], yet they do not [[judge]] themselves so clean removed from all faults [[fault]] as to be too [[good]] to suffer for these even temporal ills. for[pg 12] every [[man]], however laudably he lives [[life]], yet yields in some points to the [[lust]] of the flesh. though he do not fall into gross enormity of wickedness, and abandoned viciousness, and abominable profanity, yet he slips into some sins [[sin]], either rarely or so much the more frequently as the sins [[sin]] seem of less account. but not to mention this, where can we readily find a [[man]] who holds in fit and just estimation those persons [[person]] on account of whose revolting [[pride]], luxury, and avarice, and cursed iniquities and impiety, [[god]] now smites the [[earth]] as his predictions threatened? where is the [[man]] who lives [[life]] with them in the style in which it becomes us to [[live]] with them? for often we wickedly blind ourselves to the occasions [[occasion]] of teaching and admonishing them, sometimes even of reprimanding and chiding them, either because we shrink from the [[labour]] or are ashamed to offend them, or because we [[fear]] to lose [[good]] friendships [[friendship]], lest this should stand in the way of our advancement, or injure us in some worldly matter, which either our covetous disposition desires [[desire]] to obtain, or our weakness shrinks from losing. so that, although the conduct of wicked [[men]] is distasteful to the [[good]], and therefore they do not fall with them into that damnation which in the next [[life]] awaits such persons [[person]], yet, because they spare their damnable sins [[sin]] through [[fear]], therefore, even though their own sins [[sin]] be slight and venial, they are justly scourged with the wicked in this [[world]], though in eternity they quite escape [[punishment]]. justly, when [[god]] afflicts them in [[common]] with the wicked, do they find this [[life]] bitter, through [[love]] of whose sweetness they declined to be bitter to these sinners.

if any one forbears to reprove and find [[fault]] with those who are doing [[wrong]], because he seeks a more seasonable opportunity, or because he fears [[fear]] they may be made worse by his rebuke, or that other [[weak]] persons [[person]] may be disheartened from endeavouring to lead a [[good]] and pious [[life]], and may be driven from the [[faith]]; this man's [[man]] omission seems to be occasioned not by covetousness, but by a charitable consideration. but what is blameworthy is, that they who themselves revolt from the conduct of the wicked, and [[live]] in quite another [[fashion]], yet spare those faults [[fault]] in other [[men]] which they ought to reprehend and wean them from; and spare them because[pg 13] they [[fear]] to give offence, lest they should injure their interests in those things which [[good]] [[men]] may innocently and legitimately use,—though they use them more greedily than becomes persons [[person]] who are strangers in this [[world]], and profess the [[hope]] of a heavenly [[country]]. for not only the weaker brethren [[brother]], who enjoy [[married]] [[life]], and have [[children]] (or [[desire]] to have them), and own houses and establishments, whom the apostle addresses in the churches [[church]], warning and instructing them how they should [[live]], both the wives [[wife]] with their husbands, and the husbands with their wives [[wife]], the [[children]] with their parents, and parents with their [[children]], and servants with their masters, and masters with their servants,—not only do these weaker brethren [[brother]] gladly obtain and grudgingly lose many earthly and temporal things on account of which they dare not offend [[men]] whose polluted and wicked [[life]] greatly displeases them; but those also who [[live]] at a higher level, who are not entangled in the meshes of [[married]] [[life]], but use meagre food and raiment, do often take [[thought]] of their own safety and [[good]] name, and abstain from finding [[fault]] with the wicked, because they [[fear]] their wiles and [[violence]]. and although they do not [[fear]] them to such an extent as to be drawn to the commission of like iniquities, nay, not by any threats or [[violence]] soever; yet those very deeds which they refuse to share in the commission of, they often decline to find [[fault]] with, when possibly they might by finding [[fault]] prevent their commission. they abstain from interference, because they [[fear]] that, if it fail of [[good]] effect, their own safety or [[reputation]] may be damaged or destroyed; not because they see that their preservation and [[good]] name are needful, that they may be able to influence those who need their instruction, but rather because they weakly relish the [[flattery]] and [[respect]] of [[men]], and [[fear]] the judgments [[judgment]] of the [[people]], and the [[pain]] or [[death]] of the [[body]]; that is to say, their non-intervention is the result of selfishness, and not of [[love]].

accordingly, this seems to me to be one principal [[reason]] why the [[good]] are chastised along with the wicked, when [[god]] is pleased to visit with temporal punishments [[punishment]] the profligate manners of a [[community]]. they are punished together, not because they have spent an equally [[corrupt]] [[life]], but because[pg 14] the [[good]] as well as the wicked, though not equally with them, [[love]] this [[present]] [[life]]; while they ought to hold it cheap, that the wicked, being admonished and reformed by their [[example]], might lay hold of [[life]] eternal. and if they will not be the companions of the [[good]] in seeking [[life]] everlasting, they should be loved as enemies [[enemy]], and be dealt with patiently. for so long as they [[live]], it remains uncertain whether they may not come to a [[better]] [[mind]]. these selfish persons [[person]] have more cause to [[fear]] than those to whom it was said through the [[prophet]], "he is taken away in his [[iniquity]], but his [[blood]] will i require at the watchman's hand."[46] for watchmen or overseers of the [[people]] are appointed in churches [[church]], that they may unsparingly rebuke [[sin]]. nor is that [[man]] guiltless of the [[sin]] we speak of, who, though he be not a watchman, yet sees in the conduct of those with whom the relationships of this [[life]] bring him into contact, many things that should be blamed, and yet overlooks them, fearing to give offence, and lose such worldly blessings as may legitimately be [[desired]], but which he too eagerly grasps. then, lastly, there is another [[reason]] why the [[good]] are afflicted with temporal calamities—the [[reason]] which job's case exemplifies: that the [[human]] spirit may be proved, and that it may be manifested with what fortitude of pious trust, and with how unmercenary a [[love]], it cleaves to [[god]].[47]

10. that the saints lose nothing in losing temporal goods [[good]].

these are the considerations which one must keep in view, that he may [[answer]] the [[question]] whether any [[evil]] happens to the faithful and godly which cannot be turned to [[profit]]. or shall we say that the [[question]] is needless, and that the apostle is vapouring when he says, "we [[know]] that all things [[work]] together for [[good]] to them that [[love]] [[god]]?"[48]

they lost all they had. their [[faith]]? their godliness? the possessions of the hidden [[man]] of the [[heart]], which in the sight of [[god]] are of [[great]] price?[49] did they lose these? for these are the [[wealth]] of christians [[christian]], to whom the wealthy apostle[pg 15] said, "godliness with contentment is [[great]] gain. for we brought nothing into this [[world]], and it is [[certain]] we can carry nothing out. and having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. but they that will be [[rich]] fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown [[men]] in destruction and perdition. for the [[love]] of [[money]] is the root of all [[evil]]; which, while some coveted after, they have erred from the [[faith]], and pierced themselves through with many sorrows [[sorrow]]."[50]

they, then, who lost their worldly all in the sack of [[rome]], if they owned their possessions as they had been taught by the apostle, who himself was [[poor]] without, but [[rich]] within,—that is to say, if they used the [[world]] as not using it,—could say in the words of [[job]], heavily tried, but not overcome: "naked came i out of my mother's womb, and naked shall i return thither: the [[lord]] gave, and the [[lord]] hath taken away; as it pleased the [[lord]], so has it come to pass: blessed be the name of the [[lord]]."[51] like a [[good]] servant, [[job]] counted the will of his [[lord]] his [[great]] possession, by [[obedience]] to which his [[soul]] was enriched; nor did it grieve him to lose, while yet living, those goods [[good]] which he must shortly leave at his [[death]]. but as to those feebler spirits who, though they cannot be said to prefer earthly possessions to [[christ]], do yet cleave to them with a somewhat immoderate attachment, they have discovered by the [[pain]] of losing these things how much they were sinning in loving them. for their [[grief]] is of their own making; in the words of the apostle quoted above, "they have pierced themselves through with many sorrows [[sorrow]]." for it was well that they who had so long despised these verbal admonitions should receive the teaching of [[experience]]. for when the apostle says, "they that will be [[rich]] fall into temptation," and so on, what he blames in riches [[rich]] is not the possession of them, but the [[desire]] of them. for elsewhere he says, "charge them that are [[rich]] in this [[world]], that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches [[rich]], but in the living [[god]], who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do [[good]], that they be [[rich]] in [[good]] works [[work]], ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves[pg 16] a [[good]] foundation against the [[time]] to come, that they may lay hold on eternal [[life]]."[52] they who were making such a use of their [[property]] have been consoled for [[light]] losses by [[great]] gains, and have had more [[pleasure]] in those possessions which they have securely laid [[past]], by freely giving them away, than [[grief]] in those which they entirely lost by an anxious and selfish hoarding of them. for nothing could perish on [[earth]] save what they would be ashamed to carry away from [[earth]]. our lord's injunction runs, "lay not up for yourselves treasures upon [[earth]], where moth and rust doth [[corrupt]], and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in [[heaven]], where neither moth nor rust doth [[corrupt]], and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your [[heart]] be also."[53] and they who have listened to this injunction have proved in the [[time]] of tribulation how well they were advised in not despising this most trustworthy teacher, and most faithful and mighty guardian of their treasure. for if many were glad that their treasure was stored in places which the [[enemy]] chanced not to [[light]] upon, how much [[better]] founded was the joy of those who, by the counsel of their [[god]], had fled with their treasure to a citadel which no [[enemy]] can possibly reach! thus our paulinus, bishop of nola,[54] who voluntarily abandoned vast [[wealth]] and became quite [[poor]], though abundantly [[rich]] in holiness, when the barbarians sacked nola, and took him [[prisoner]], used silently to [[pray]], as he afterwards told me, "o [[lord]], let me not be troubled for gold and silver, for where all my treasure is thou knowest." for all his treasure was where he had been taught to hide and store it by him who had also foretold that these calamities would happen in the [[world]]. consequently those persons [[person]] who obeyed their [[lord]] when he warned them where and how to lay up treasure, did not lose even their earthly possessions in the [[invasion]] of the barbarians; while those who are now repenting[pg 17] that they did not obey him have learnt the [[right]] use of earthly goods [[good]], if not by the [[wisdom]] which would have prevented their loss, at least by the [[experience]] which follows it.

but some [[good]] and [[christian]] [[men]] have been put to the torture, that they might be forced to deliver up their goods [[good]] to the [[enemy]]. they could indeed neither deliver nor lose that [[good]] which made themselves [[good]]. if, however, they preferred torture to the [[surrender]] of the mammon of [[iniquity]], then i say they were not [[good]] [[men]]. rather they should have been reminded that, if they [[suffered]] so severely for the sake of [[money]], they should endure all torment, if need be, for christ's sake; that they might be taught to [[love]] him rather who enriches with eternal felicity all who suffer for him, and not silver and gold, for which it was pitiable to suffer, whether they preserved it by telling a [[lie]], or lost it by telling the [[truth]]. for under these tortures no one lost [[christ]] by confessing him, no one preserved [[wealth]] save by denying its existence. so that possibly the torture which taught them that they should set their affections on a possession they could not lose, was more useful than those possessions which, without any useful fruit at all, disquieted and tormented their anxious owners. but then we are reminded that some were tortured who had no [[wealth]] to [[surrender]], but who were not believed when they said so. these too, however, had perhaps some craving for [[wealth]], and were not willingly [[poor]] with a holy resignation; and to such it had to be made plain, that not the actual possession alone, but also the [[desire]] of [[wealth]], deserved such excruciating pains [[pain]]. and even if they were destitute of any hidden stores of gold and silver, because they were living in hopes [[hope]] of a [[better]] [[life]],—i [[know]] not indeed if any such [[person]] was tortured on the supposition that he had [[wealth]]; but if so, then certainly in confessing, when put to the [[question]], a holy [[poverty]], he confessed [[christ]]. and though it was scarcely to be expected that the barbarians should [[believe]] him, yet no confessor of a holy [[poverty]] could be tortured without receiving a heavenly [[reward]].

again, they say that the long famine laid many a [[christian]] low. but this, too, the faithful turned to [[good]] uses by a pious endurance of it. for those whom famine killed outright it[pg 18] rescued from the ills of this [[life]], as a kindly disease would have done; and those who were only hunger-bitten were taught to [[live]] more sparingly, and inured to longer fasts.

11. of the end of this [[life]], whether it is material that it be long delayed.

but, it is added, many christians [[christian]] were slaughtered, and were put to [[death]] in a hideous variety of cruel ways. well, if this be hard to bear, it is assuredly the [[common]] lot of all who are born into this [[life]]. of this at least i am [[certain]], that no one has ever died who was not destined to [[die]] some [[time]]. now the end of [[life]] puts the longest [[life]] on a par with the shortest. for of two things which have alike ceased to be, the one is not [[better]], the other worse—the one greater, the other less.[55] and of what consequence is it what [[kind]] of [[death]] puts an end to [[life]], since he who has died once is not forced to go through the same ordeal a second [[time]]? and as in the daily casualties of [[life]] every [[man]] is, as it were, threatened with numberless deaths [[death]], so long as it remains uncertain which of them is his [[fate]], i would ask whether it is not [[better]] to suffer one and [[die]], than to [[live]] in [[fear]] of all? i am not unaware of the poor-spirited [[fear]] which prompts us to choose rather to [[live]] long in [[fear]] of so many deaths [[death]], than to [[die]] once and so escape them all; but the [[weak]] and cowardly shrinking of the flesh is one thing, and the well-considered and reasonable persuasion of the [[soul]] quite another. that [[death]] is not to be judged an [[evil]] which is the end of a [[good]] [[life]]; for [[death]] becomes [[evil]] only by the retribution which follows it. they, then, who are destined to [[die]], need not be careful to inquire what [[death]] they are to [[die]], but into what place [[death]] will usher them. and since christians [[christian]] are well aware that the [[death]] of the godly pauper whose sores the dogs licked was far [[better]] than of the wicked [[rich]] [[man]] who lay in purple and fine linen, what harm could these terrific deaths [[death]] do to the [[dead]] who had lived well?

[pg 19]

12. of the burial of the [[dead]]: that the denial of it to christians [[christian]] does them no injury.[56]

further still, we are reminded that in such a carnage as then occurred, the bodies [[body]] could not even be buried. but godly confidence is not appalled by so ill-omened a circumstance; for the faithful bear in [[mind]] that assurance has been given that not a hair of their head shall perish, and that, therefore, though they even be devoured by beasts, their blessed resurrection will not hereby be hindered. the [[truth]] would nowise have said, "fear not them which kill the [[body]], but are not able to kill the [[soul]],"[57] if anything whatever that an [[enemy]] could do to the [[body]] of the slain could be detrimental to the future [[life]]. or will some one perhaps take so absurd a position as to contend that those who kill the [[body]] are not to be feared before [[death]], and lest they kill the [[body]], but after [[death]], lest they deprive it of burial? if this be so, then that is false which [[christ]] says, "be not afraid of them that kill the [[body]], and after that have no more that they can do;"[58] for it seems they can do [[great]] injury to the [[dead]] [[body]]. far be it from us to suppose that the [[truth]] can be thus false. they who kill the [[body]] are said "to do something," because the death-blow is [[felt]], the [[body]] still having sensation; but after that, they have no more that they can do, for in the slain [[body]] there is no sensation. and so there are indeed many bodies [[body]] of christians [[christian]] lying unburied; but no one has separated them from [[heaven]], nor from that [[earth]] which is all filled with the presence of him who knows [[know]] whence he will raise again what he created. it is said, indeed, in the psalm: "the [[dead]] bodies [[body]] of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the [[heaven]], the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the [[earth]]. their [[blood]] have they shed like water round about [[jerusalem]]; and there was none to bury them."[59] but this was said rather to exhibit the [[cruelty]] of those who did these things, than the misery of those who [[suffered]] them. to the [[eyes]] of [[men]] this appears a harsh and doleful lot, yet "precious in the sight of the [[lord]] is the [[death]] of his saints."[pg 20][60] wherefore all these [[last]] offices and ceremonies [[ceremony]] that concern the [[dead]], the careful [[funeral]] arrangements, and the equipment of the tomb, and the pomp of obsequies, are rather the solace of the living than the comfort of the [[dead]]. if a costly burial does any [[good]] to a wicked [[man]], a squalid burial, or none at all, may harm the godly. his crowd of domestics furnished the purple-clad dives with a [[funeral]] gorgeous in the eye of [[man]]; but in the sight of [[god]] that was a more sumptuous [[funeral]] which the ulcerous pauper received at the hands of the angels, who did not carry him out to a marble tomb, but bore him aloft to abraham's bosom.

the [[men]] against whom i have undertaken to defend the [[city]] of [[god]] laugh at all this. but even their own philosophers[61] have despised a careful burial; and often whole armies [[army]] have fought and fallen for their earthly [[country]] without caring to inquire whether they would be left exposed on the field of [[battle]], or become the food of wild beasts. of this [[noble]] disregard of sepulture poetry has well said: "he who has no tomb has the [[sky]] for his vault."[62] how much less ought they to insult over the unburied bodies [[body]] of christians [[christian]], to whom it has been promised that the flesh itself shall be restored, and the [[body]] formed anew, all the members of it being gathered not only from the [[earth]], but from the most secret recesses of any other of the elements in which the [[dead]] bodies [[body]] of [[men]] have lain hid!

13. reasons [[reason]] for burying the bodies [[body]] of the saints.

nevertheless the bodies [[body]] of the [[dead]] are not on this account to be despised and left unburied; least of all the bodies [[body]] of the righteous and faithful, which have been used by the holy ghost as his organs and instruments for all [[good]] works [[work]]. for if the dress of a [[father]], or his ring, or anything he wore, be precious to his [[children]], in proportion to the [[love]] they bore him, with how much more [[reason]] ought we to [[care]] for[pg 21] the bodies [[body]] of those we [[love]], which they wore far more closely and intimately than any clothing! for the [[body]] is not an extraneous ornament or aid, but a part of man's [[man]] very [[nature]]. and therefore to the righteous of ancient times [[time]] the [[last]] offices were piously rendered, and sepulchres provided for them, and obsequies celebrated;[63] and they themselves, while yet alive, gave commandment to their sons [[son]] about the burial, and, on [[occasion]], even about the removal of their bodies [[body]] to some favourite place.[64] and tobit, according to the angel's testimony, is commended, and is said to have pleased [[god]] by burying the [[dead]].[65] our [[lord]] himself, too, though he was to rise again the third day, applauds, and commends to our applause, the [[good]] [[work]] of the [[religious]] woman who poured precious ointment over his limbs, and did it against his burial.[66] and the gospel speaks with commendation of those who were careful to take down his [[body]] from the cross, and wrap it lovingly in costly cerements, and see to its burial.[67] these instances certainly do not prove that corpses have any feeling; but they show that god's providence extends even to the bodies [[body]] of the [[dead]], and that such pious offices are pleasing to him, as cherishing [[faith]] in the resurrection. and we may also draw from them this wholesome lesson, that if [[god]] does not forget even any [[kind]] office which loving [[care]] pays [[pay]] to the unconscious [[dead]], much more does he [[reward]] the charity we exercise towards the living. other things, indeed, which the holy patriarchs said of the burial and removal of their bodies [[body]], they meant to be taken in a prophetic sense; but of these we need not here speak at large, what we have already said being sufficient. but if the want of those things which are necessary for the support of the living, as food and clothing, though painful and trying, does not break down the fortitude and [[virtuous]] endurance of [[good]] [[men]], nor eradicate piety from their souls [[soul]], but rather renders it more fruitful, how much less can the absence of the [[funeral]], and of the other customary attentions paid to the [[dead]], render those wretched who are already reposing in the hidden abodes of the blessed! consequently, though in the sack of [[rome]] and of other towns the dead[pg 22] bodies [[body]] of the christians [[christian]] were deprived of these [[last]] offices, this is neither the [[fault]] of the living, for they could not render them; nor an infliction to the [[dead]], for they cannot [[feel]] the loss.

14. of the captivity of the saints, and that [[divine]] consolation never failed them therein.

but, say they, many christians [[christian]] were even [[led]] away captive. this indeed were a most pitiable [[fate]], if they could be [[led]] away to any place where they could not find their [[god]]. but for this calamity also [[sacred]] [[scripture]] affords [[great]] consolation. the three youths[68] were captives; daniel was a captive; so were other prophets [[prophet]]: and [[god]], the comforter, did not fail them. and in like manner he has not failed his own [[people]] in the [[power]] of a nation which, though barbarous, is yet [[human]],—he who did not abandon the prophet[69] in the belly of a monster. these things, indeed, are turned to ridicule rather than credited by those with whom we are debating; though they [[believe]] what they [[read]] in their own books [[book]], that arion of methymna, the famous lyrist,[70] when he was thrown overboard, was received on a dolphin's back and carried to [[land]]. but that story of ours about the [[prophet]] jonah is far more incredible,—more incredible because more marvellous, and more marvellous because a greater exhibition of [[power]].

15. of regulus, in whom we have an [[example]] of the voluntary endurance of captivity for the sake of [[religion]]; which yet did not [[profit]] him, though he was a worshipper of the gods.

but among their own famous [[men]] they have a very [[noble]] [[example]] of the voluntary endurance of captivity in [[obedience]] to a [[religious]] scruple. marcus attilius regulus, a roman general, was a [[prisoner]] in the hands of the carthaginians. but they, being more anxious to exchange their prisoners [[prisoner]] with the romans than to keep them, sent regulus as a special envoy with their own ambassadors to negotiate this exchange, but bound him first with an oath, that if he failed to accomplish their [[wish]], he would return to [[carthage]]. he went, and persuaded the senate to the opposite course, because he[pg 23] believed it was not for the advantage of the roman [[republic]] to make an exchange of prisoners [[prisoner]]. after he had thus exerted his influence, the romans did not compel him to return to the [[enemy]]; but what he had sworn he voluntarily performed. but the carthaginians put him to [[death]] with refined, elaborate, and horrible tortures. they shut him up in a narrow box, in which he was compelled to stand, and in which finely sharpened nails were fixed all round about him, so that he could not lean upon any part of it without intense [[pain]]; and so they killed him by depriving him of sleep.[71] with [[justice]], indeed, do they applaud the [[virtue]] which rose superior to so frightful a [[fate]]. however, the gods he swore by were those who are now supposed to avenge the prohibition of their [[worship]], by inflicting these [[present]] calamities on the [[human]] [[race]]. but if these gods, who were worshipped specially in this behalf, that they might confer [[happiness]] in this [[life]], either willed or permitted these punishments [[punishment]] to be inflicted on one who kept his oath to them, what more cruel [[punishment]] could they in their anger have inflicted on a perjured [[person]]? but why may i not draw from my reasoning a double inference? regulus certainly had such reverence for the gods, that for his oath's sake he would neither remain in his own [[land]], nor go elsewhere, but without hesitation returned to his bitterest enemies [[enemy]]. if he [[thought]] that this course would be advantageous with [[respect]] to this [[present]] [[life]], he was certainly much deceived, for it brought his [[life]] to a frightful termination. by his own [[example]], in [[fact]], he taught that the gods do not secure the temporal [[happiness]] of their worshippers; since he himself, who was devoted to their [[worship]], was both conquered in [[battle]] and taken [[prisoner]], and then, because he refused to act in violation of the oath he had sworn by them, was tortured and put to [[death]] by a new, and hitherto unheard of, and all too horrible [[kind]] of [[punishment]]. and on the supposition that the worshippers of the gods are rewarded by felicity in the [[life]] to come, why, then, do they calumniate the influence of [[christianity]]? why do they assert that this[pg 24] disaster has overtaken the [[city]] because it has ceased to [[worship]] its gods, since, [[worship]] them as assiduously as it may, it may yet be as unfortunate as regulus was? or will some one carry so wonderful a blindness to the extent of wildly attempting, in the face of the evident [[truth]], to contend that though one [[man]] might be unfortunate, though a worshipper of the gods, yet a whole [[city]] could not be so? that is to say, the [[power]] of their gods is [[better]] adapted to preserve multitudes than individuals [[individual]],—as if a multitude were not composed of individuals [[individual]].

but if they say that m. regulus, even while a [[prisoner]] and enduring these bodily torments, might yet enjoy the blessedness of a [[virtuous]] [[soul]],[72] then let them recognise that true [[virtue]] by which a [[city]] also may be blessed. for the blessedness of a [[community]] and of an [[individual]] flow from the same source; for a [[community]] is nothing else than a harmonious collection of individuals [[individual]]. so that i am not concerned meantime to discuss what [[kind]] of [[virtue]] regulus possessed: enough, that by his very [[noble]] [[example]] they are forced to own that the gods are to be worshipped not for the sake of bodily comforts or external advantages; for he preferred to lose all such things rather than offend the gods by whom he had sworn. but what can we make of [[men]] who [[glory]] in having such a citizen, but dread having a [[city]] like him? if they do not dread this, then let them acknowledge that some such calamity as befell regulus may also befall a [[community]], though they be worshipping their gods as diligently as he; and let them no longer throw the blame of their misfortunes on [[christianity]]. but as our [[present]] concern is with those christians [[christian]] who were taken prisoners [[prisoner]], let those who take [[occasion]] from this calamity to revile our most wholesome [[religion]] in a [[fashion]] not less imprudent than impudent, consider this and hold their [[peace]]; for if it was no reproach to their gods that a most punctilious worshipper of theirs should, for the sake of keeping his oath to them, be deprived of his native [[land]] without [[hope]] of finding another, and fall into the hands of his enemies [[enemy]], and be put to [[death]] by a long-drawn and exquisite torture, much less ought the[pg 25] [[christian]] name to be charged with the captivity of those who [[believe]] in its [[power]], since they, in confident expectation of a heavenly [[country]], [[know]] that they are pilgrims even in their own homes [[home]].

16. of the violation of the consecrated and other [[christian]] virgins to which they were subjected in captivity, and to which their own will gave no [[consent]]; and whether this contaminated their souls [[soul]].

but they fancy they bring a conclusive charge against [[christianity]], when they aggravate the [[horror]] of captivity by adding that not only wives [[wife]] and unmarried maidens, but even consecrated virgins, were violated. but truly, with [[respect]] to this, it is not [[christian]] [[faith]], nor piety, nor even the [[virtue]] of chastity, which is hemmed into any difficulty: the only difficulty is so to treat the [[subject]] as to satisfy at once modesty and [[reason]]. and in discussing it we shall not be so careful to reply to our accusers as to comfort our [[friends]]. let this, therefore, in the first place, be laid down as an unassailable position, that the [[virtue]] which makes the [[life]] [[good]] has its [[throne]] in the [[soul]], and thence rules [[rule]] the members of the [[body]], which becomes holy in [[virtue]] of the holiness of the will; and that while the will remains firm and unshaken, nothing that another [[person]] does with the [[body]], or upon the [[body]], is any [[fault]] of the [[person]] who suffers it, so long as he cannot escape it without [[sin]]. but as not only [[pain]] may be inflicted, but [[lust]] gratified on the [[body]] of another, whenever anything of this latter [[kind]] takes place, shame invades even a thoroughly pure spirit from which modesty has not departed,—shame, lest that act which could not be [[suffered]] without some sensual [[pleasure]], should be believed to have been committed also with some assent of the will.

17. of suicide committed through [[fear]] of [[punishment]] or dishonour.

and consequently, even if some of these virgins killed themselves to avoid such disgrace, who that has any [[human]] feeling would refuse to [[forgive]] them? and as for those who would not put an end to their lives [[life]], lest they might seem to escape the crime of another by a [[sin]] of their own, he who lays this to their charge as a [[great]] wickedness is himself not guiltless of the [[fault]] of folly. for if it is not lawful to take the law[pg 26] into our own hands, and slay even a guilty [[person]], whose [[death]] no [[public]] sentence has warranted, then certainly he who kills himself is a homicide, and so much the guiltier of his own [[death]], as he was more [[innocent]] of that offence for which he doomed himself to [[die]]. do we justly execrate the deed of judas, and does [[truth]] itself pronounce that by hanging himself he rather aggravated than expiated the guilt of that most iniquitous betrayal, since, by despairing of god's [[mercy]] in his [[sorrow]] that wrought [[death]], he left to himself no place for a healing penitence? how much more ought he to abstain from laying [[violent]] hands on himself who has done nothing worthy of such a punishment! for judas, when he killed himself, killed a wicked [[man]]; but he passed from this [[life]] chargeable not only with the [[death]] of [[christ]], but with his own: for though he killed himself on account of his crime, his killing himself was another crime. why, then, should a [[man]] who has done no ill do ill to himself, and by killing himself kill the [[innocent]] to escape another's guilty act, and perpetrate upon himself a [[sin]] of his own, that the [[sin]] of another may not be perpetrated on him?

18. of the [[violence]] which may be done to the [[body]] by another's [[lust]], while the [[mind]] remains inviolate.

but is there a [[fear]] that even another's [[lust]] may pollute the violated? it will not pollute, if it be another's: if it pollute, it is not another's, but is shared also by the polluted. but since purity is a [[virtue]] of the [[soul]], and has for its companion [[virtue]] the fortitude which will rather endure all ills than [[consent]] to [[evil]]; and since no one, however magnanimous and pure, has always the disposal of his own [[body]], but can control only the [[consent]] and refusal of his will, what sane [[man]] can suppose that, if his [[body]] be seized and forcibly made use of to satisfy the [[lust]] of another, he thereby loses his purity? for if purity can be thus destroyed, then assuredly purity is no [[virtue]] of the [[soul]]; nor can it be numbered among those [[good]] things by which the [[life]] is made [[good]], but among the [[good]] things of the [[body]], in the same category as [[strength]], [[beauty]], sound and unbroken health, and, in short, all such [[good]] things as may be diminished without at all diminishing the goodness and rectitude of our [[life]]. but if purity[pg 27] be nothing [[better]] than these, why should the [[body]] be perilled that it may be preserved? if, on the other hand, it belongs to the [[soul]], then not even when the [[body]] is violated is it lost. nay more, the [[virtue]] of holy continence, when it resists the uncleanness of carnal [[lust]], sanctifies even the [[body]], and therefore when this continence remains unsubdued, even the [[sanctity]] of the [[body]] is preserved, because the will to use it holily remains, and, so far as lies [[lie]] in the [[body]] itself, the [[power]] also.

for the [[sanctity]] of the [[body]] does not consist in the integrity of its members, nor in their exemption from all touch; for they are exposed to various accidents which do [[violence]] to and wound them, and the surgeons who administer relief often perform operations that sicken the spectator. a midwife, suppose, has (whether maliciously or accidentally, or through unskilfulness) destroyed the virginity of some girl, while endeavouring to ascertain it: i suppose no one is so foolish as to [[believe]] that, by this destruction of the integrity of one organ, the virgin has lost anything even of her bodily [[sanctity]]. and thus, so long as the [[soul]] keeps this firmness of [[purpose]] which sanctifies even the [[body]], the [[violence]] done by another's [[lust]] makes no impression on this bodily [[sanctity]], which is preserved intact by one's own persistent continence. suppose a virgin violates the oath she has sworn to [[god]], and goes to meet her seducer with the intention of yielding to him, shall we say that as she goes she is possessed even of bodily [[sanctity]], when already she has lost and destroyed that [[sanctity]] of [[soul]] which sanctifies the [[body]]? far be it from us to so misapply words. let us rather draw this conclusion, that while the [[sanctity]] of the [[soul]] remains even when the [[body]] is violated, the [[sanctity]] of the [[body]] is not lost; and that, in like manner, the [[sanctity]] of the [[body]] is lost when the [[sanctity]] of the [[soul]] is violated, though the [[body]] itself remain intact. and therefore a woman who has been violated by the [[sin]] of another, and without any [[consent]] of her own, has no cause to put herself to [[death]]; much less has she cause to commit suicide in order to avoid such violation, for in that case she commits [[certain]] homicide to prevent a crime which is uncertain as yet, and not her own.

[pg 28]

19. of lucretia, who put an end to her [[life]] because of the outrage done her.

this, then, is our position, and it seems sufficiently lucid. we maintain that when a woman is violated while her [[soul]] admits no [[consent]] to the [[iniquity]], but remains inviolably chaste, the [[sin]] is not hers, but his who violates her. but do they against whom we have to defend not only the souls [[soul]], but the [[sacred]] bodies [[body]] too of these outraged [[christian]] captives,—do they, perhaps, dare to dispute our position? but all [[know]] how loudly they extol the purity of lucretia, that [[noble]] matron of ancient [[rome]]. when [[king]] tarquin's [[son]] had violated her [[body]], she made known the wickedness of this [[young]] profligate to her husband collatinus, and to brutus her kinsman, [[men]] of high rank and full of [[courage]], and bound them by an oath to avenge it. then, heart-sick, and unable to bear the shame, she put an end to her [[life]]. what shall we call her? an adulteress, or chaste? there is no [[question]] which she was. not more happily than truly did a declaimer say of this [[sad]] occurrence: "here was a marvel: there were two, and only one committed adultery." most forcibly and truly spoken. for this declaimer, seeing in the union of the two bodies [[body]] the foul [[lust]] of the one, and the chaste will of the other, and giving heed not to the contact of the bodily members, but to the wide [[diversity]] of their souls [[soul]], says: "there were two, but the adultery was committed only by one."

but how is it, that she who was no partner to the crime bears the heavier [[punishment]] of the two? for the adulterer was only [[banished]] along with his [[father]]; she [[suffered]] the extreme penalty. if that was not impurity by which she was unwillingly ravished, then this is not [[justice]] by which she, being chaste, is punished. to you i appeal, ye laws [[law]] and judges [[judge]] of [[rome]]. even after the perpetration of [[great]] enormities, you do not suffer the [[criminal]] to be slain untried. if, then, one were to bring to your bar this case, and were to prove to you that a woman not only untried, but chaste and [[innocent]], had been killed, would you not visit the murderer with [[punishment]] proportionably severe? this crime was committed by lucretia; that lucretia so celebrated and lauded slew the [[innocent]], chaste, outraged lucretia. pronounce sentence. but if you cannot, because there does not[pg 29] compear any one whom you can punish, why do you extol with such unmeasured laudation her who slew an [[innocent]] and chaste woman? assuredly you will find it impossible to defend her before the judges [[judge]] of the realms below, if they be such as your poets are fond of representing them; for she is among those

"who guiltless sent themselves to doom, and all for loathing of the day, in madness threw their lives [[life]] away."

and if she with the others wishes [[wish]] to return,

"fate bars the way: around their keep the slow unlovely waters creep, and bind with ninefold chain."[73]
or perhaps she is not there, because she slew herself conscious of guilt, not of innocence? she herself alone knows [[know]] her [[reason]]; but what if she was betrayed by the [[pleasure]] of the act, and gave some [[consent]] to sextus, though so violently abusing her, and then was so affected with remorse, that she [[thought]] [[death]] alone could expiate her [[sin]]? even though this were the case, she ought still to have held her hand from suicide, if she could with her false gods have accomplished a fruitful repentance. however, if such were the [[state]] of the case, and if it were false that there were two, but one only committed adultery; if the [[truth]] were that both were involved in it, one by open assault, the other by secret [[consent]], then she did not kill an [[innocent]] woman; and therefore her erudite defenders may maintain that she is not among that class of the dwellers below "who guiltless sent themselves to doom." but this case of lucretia is in such a dilemma, that if you extenuate the homicide, you confirm the adultery: if you acquit her of adultery, you make the charge of homicide heavier; and there is no way out of the dilemma, when one asks, if she was adulterous, why [[praise]] her? if chaste, why slay her?

nevertheless, for our [[purpose]] of refuting those who are unable to comprehend what true [[sanctity]] is, and who therefore insult over our outraged [[christian]] [[women]], it is enough that in the instance of this [[noble]] roman matron it was said in her[pg 30] [[praise]], "there were two, but the adultery was the crime of only one." for lucretia was confidently believed to be superior to the contamination of any consenting [[thought]] to the adultery. and accordingly, since she killed herself for being subjected to an outrage in which she had no guilty part, it is obvious that this act of hers was prompted not by the [[love]] of purity, but by the overwhelming burden of her shame. she was ashamed that so foul a crime had been perpetrated upon her, though without her abetting; and this matron, with the roman [[love]] of [[glory]] in her veins, was seized with a proud dread that, if she continued to [[live]], it would be supposed she willingly did not resent the [[wrong]] that had been done her. she could not exhibit to [[men]] her [[conscience]], but she judged that her self-inflicted [[punishment]] would testify her [[state]] of [[mind]]; and she burned with shame at the [[thought]] that her patient endurance of the foul affront that another had done her, should be construed into complicity with him. not such was the decision of the [[christian]] [[women]] who [[suffered]] as she did, and yet survive. they declined to avenge upon themselves the guilt of others, and so add crimes of their own to those crimes in which they had no share. for this they would have done had their shame driven them to homicide, as the [[lust]] of their enemies [[enemy]] had driven them to adultery. within their own souls [[soul]], in the witness of their own [[conscience]], they enjoy the [[glory]] of chastity. in the sight of [[god]], too, they are esteemed pure, and this contents them; they ask no more: it suffices them to have opportunity of doing [[good]], and they decline to evade the distress of [[human]] suspicion, lest they thereby deviate from the [[divine]] [[law]].

20. that christians [[christian]] have no [[authority]] for committing suicide in any circumstances whatever.

it is not without significance, that in no passage of the holy canonical books [[book]] there can be found either [[divine]] precept or permission to take away our own [[life]], whether for the sake of entering on the enjoyment of immortality, or of shunning, or ridding ourselves of anything whatever. nay, the [[law]], rightly interpreted, even prohibits suicide, where it says, "thou shalt not kill." this is proved specially by the[pg 31] omission of the words "thy neighbour," which are inserted when false witness is forbidden: "thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour." nor yet should any one on this account suppose he has not broken this commandment if he has borne false witness only against himself. for the [[love]] of our neighbour is regulated by the [[love]] of ourselves, as it is written, "thou shalt [[love]] thy neighbour as thyself." if, then, he who makes false statements about himself is not less guilty of bearing false witness than if he had made them to the injury of his neighbour; although in the commandment prohibiting false witness only his neighbour is mentioned, and persons [[person]] taking no pains [[pain]] to [[understand]] it might suppose that a [[man]] was allowed to be a false witness to his own hurt; how much greater [[reason]] have we to [[understand]] that a [[man]] may not kill himself, since in the commandment, "thou shalt not kill," there is no limitation added nor any exception made in favour of any one, and least of all in favour of him on whom the command is laid! and so some attempt to extend this command even to beasts and cattle, as if it forbade us to take [[life]] from any creature. but if so, why not extend it also to the plants, and all that is rooted in and nourished by the [[earth]]? for though this class of creatures have no sensation, yet they also are said to [[live]], and consequently they can [[die]]; and therefore, if [[violence]] be done them, can be killed. so, too, the apostle, when speaking of the seeds of such things as these, says, "that which thou sowest is not quickened except it [[die]];" and in the psalm it is said, "he killed their vines with hail." must we therefore reckon it a breaking of this commandment, "thou shalt not kill," to pull a flower? are we thus insanely to countenance the foolish error of the manichæans? putting aside, then, these ravings, if, when we say, thou shalt not kill, we do not [[understand]] this of the plants, since they have no sensation, nor of the irrational animals that fly, swim, walk, or creep, since they are dissociated from us by their want of [[reason]], and are therefore by the just appointment of the creator subjected to us to kill or keep alive for our own uses; if so, then it remains that we [[understand]] that commandment simply of [[man]]. the commandment is, "thou shalt not kill [[man]];" therefore neither another nor[pg 32] yourself, for he who kills himself still kills nothing else than [[man]].

21. of the cases in which we may put [[men]] to [[death]] without incurring the guilt of murder.

however, there are some exceptions made by the [[divine]] [[authority]] to its own [[law]], that [[men]] may not be put to [[death]]. these exceptions are of two kinds [[kind]], being justified either by a general [[law]], or by a special commission granted for a [[time]] to some [[individual]]. and in this latter case, he to whom [[authority]] is delegated, and who is but the [[sword]] in the hand of him who uses it, is not himself responsible for the [[death]] he deals. and, accordingly, they who have waged [[war]] in [[obedience]] to the [[divine]] command, or in conformity with his laws [[law]] have represented in their persons [[person]] the [[public]] [[justice]] or the [[wisdom]] of [[government]], and in this capacity have put to [[death]] wicked [[men]]; such persons [[person]] have by no means violated the commandment, "thou shalt not kill." [[abraham]] indeed was not merely deemed guiltless of [[cruelty]], but was even applauded for his piety, because he was ready to slay his [[son]] in [[obedience]] to [[god]], not to his own passion. and it is reasonably enough made a [[question]], whether we are to esteem it to have been in compliance with a command of [[god]] that jephthah killed his [[daughter]], because she met him when he had vowed that he would [[sacrifice]] to [[god]] whatever first met him as he returned victorious from [[battle]]. samson, too, who drew down the house on himself and his foes together, is justified only on this ground, that the spirit who wrought wonders by him had given him secret instructions to do this. with the exception, then, of these two classes of cases, which are justified either by a just [[law]] that applies generally, or by a special intimation from [[god]] himself, the fountain of all [[justice]], whoever kills a [[man]], either himself or another, is implicated in the guilt of murder.

22. that suicide can never be prompted by magnanimity.

but they who have laid [[violent]] hands on themselves are perhaps to be admired for their greatness of [[soul]], though they cannot be applauded for the soundness of their [[judgment]]. however, if you look at the matter more closely, you will scarcely call it greatness of [[soul]], which prompts a [[man]] to kill[pg 33] himself rather than bear up against some hardships of [[fortune]], or sins [[sin]] in which he is not implicated. is it not rather proof of a feeble [[mind]], to be unable to bear either the pains [[pain]] of bodily servitude or the foolish [[opinion]] of the vulgar? and is not that to be pronounced the greater [[mind]], which rather faces than flees the ills of [[life]], and which, in comparison of the [[light]] and purity of [[conscience]], holds in small esteem the [[judgment]] of [[men]], and specially of the vulgar, which is frequently involved in a mist of error? and, therefore, if suicide is to be esteemed a magnanimous act, none can take higher rank for magnanimity than that cleombrotus, who (as the story goes), when he had [[read]] plato's [[book]] in which he treats of the immortality of the [[soul]], threw himself from a wall, and so passed from this [[life]] to that which he believed to be [[better]]. for he was not hard pressed by calamity, nor by any accusation, false or true, which he could not very well have lived down: there was, in short, no motive but only magnanimity urging him to seek [[death]], and break away from the sweet detention of this [[life]]. and yet that this was a magnanimous rather than a justifiable action, [[plato]] himself, whom he had [[read]], would have told him; for he would certainly have been forward to commit, or at least to recommend suicide, had not the same bright [[intellect]] which saw that the [[soul]] was [[immortal]], discerned also that to seek immortality by suicide was to be prohibited rather than encouraged.

again, it is said many have killed themselves to prevent an [[enemy]] doing so. but we are not inquiring whether it has been done, but whether it ought to have been done. sound [[judgment]] is to be preferred even to examples [[example]], and indeed examples [[example]] harmonize with the voice of [[reason]]; but not all examples [[example]], but those only which are distinguished by their piety, and are proportionately worthy of imitation. for suicide we cannot cite the [[example]] of patriarchs, prophets [[prophet]], or [[apostles]]; though our [[lord]] [[jesus]] [[christ]], when he admonished them to flee from [[city]] to [[city]] if they were persecuted, might very well have taken that [[occasion]] to advise them to lay [[violent]] hands on themselves, and so escape their persecutors. but seeing he did not do this, nor proposed this mode of departing this [[life]], though he were addressing his own[pg 34] [[friends]] for whom he had promised to prepare everlasting mansions, it is obvious that such examples [[example]] as are produced from the "nations that forget [[god]]," give no warrant of imitation to the worshippers of the one true [[god]].

23. what we are to [[think]] of the [[example]] of cato, who slew himself because unable to endure cæsar's [[victory]].

besides lucretia, of whom enough has already been said, our advocates of suicide have some difficulty in finding any other prescriptive [[example]], unless it be that of cato, who killed himself at utica. his [[example]] is appealed to, not because he was the only [[man]] who did so, but because he was so esteemed as a learned and excellent [[man]], that it could plausibly be maintained that what he did was and is a [[good]] thing to do. but of this action of his, what can i say but that his own [[friends]], enlightened [[men]] as he, prudently dissuaded him, and therefore judged his act to be that of a feeble rather than a [[strong]] spirit, and dictated not by honourable feeling forestalling shame, but by weakness shrinking from hardships? indeed, cato condemns himself by the [[advice]] he gave to his dearly loved [[son]]. for if it was a disgrace to [[live]] under cæsar's [[rule]], why did the [[father]] urge the [[son]] to this disgrace, by encouraging him to trust absolutely to cæsar's generosity? why did he not persuade him to [[die]] along with himself? if torquatus was applauded for putting his [[son]] to [[death]], when contrary to orders he had engaged, and engaged successfully, with the [[enemy]], why did conquered cato spare his conquered [[son]], though he did not spare himself? was it more disgraceful to be a victor contrary to orders, than to submit to a victor contrary to the received ideas [[idea]] of [[honour]]? cato, then, cannot have deemed it to be shameful to [[live]] under cæsar's [[rule]], for had he done so, the father's [[sword]] would have delivered his [[son]] from this disgrace. the [[truth]] is, that his [[son]], whom he both hoped and [[desired]] would be spared by cæsar, was not more loved by him than cæsar was envied the [[glory]] of pardoning him (as indeed cæsar himself is reported to have said[74]); or if envy is too [[strong]] a word, let us say he was ashamed that this [[glory]] should be his.

[pg 35]

24. that in that [[virtue]] in which regulus excels cato, christians [[christian]] are pre-eminently distinguished.

our opponents are offended at our preferring to cato the saintly [[job]], who endured dreadful evils [[evil]] in his [[body]] rather than deliver himself from all torment by self-inflicted [[death]]; or other saints, of whom it is recorded in our authoritative and trustworthy books [[book]] that they bore captivity and the oppression of their enemies [[enemy]] rather than commit suicide. but their own books [[book]] authorize us to prefer to marcus cato, marcus regulus. for cato had never conquered cæsar; and when conquered by him, disdained to submit himself to him, and that he might escape this submission put himself to [[death]]. regulus, on the contrary, had formerly conquered the carthaginians, and in command of the [[army]] of [[rome]] had won for the roman [[republic]] a [[victory]] which no citizen could bewail, and which the [[enemy]] himself was constrained to [[admire]]; yet afterwards, when he in his turn was defeated by them, he preferred to be their captive rather than to put himself beyond their reach by suicide. patient under the domination of the carthaginians, and constant in his [[love]] of the romans, he neither deprived the one of his conquered [[body]], nor the other of his unconquered spirit. neither was it [[love]] of [[life]] that prevented him from killing himself. this was plainly enough indicated by his unhesitatingly returning, on account of his promise and oath, to the same enemies [[enemy]] whom he had more grievously provoked by his words in the senate than even by his arms in [[battle]]. having such a contempt of [[life]], and preferring to end it by whatever torments excited enemies [[enemy]] might contrive, rather than terminate it by his own hand, he could not more distinctly have declared how [[great]] a crime he judged suicide to be. among all their famous and remarkable [[citizens]], the romans have no [[better]] [[man]] to boast of than this, who was neither corrupted by [[prosperity]], for he remained a very [[poor]] [[man]] after winning such victories [[victory]]; nor broken by adversity, for he returned intrepidly to the most miserable end. but if the bravest and most renowned heroes, who had but an earthly [[country]] to defend, and who, though they had but false gods, yet rendered them a true [[worship]], and carefully kept their oath to them; if these [[men]], who by the custom[pg 36] and [[right]] of [[war]] put conquered enemies [[enemy]] to the [[sword]], yet shrank from putting an end to their own lives [[life]] even when conquered by their enemies [[enemy]]; if, though they had no [[fear]] at all of [[death]], they would yet rather suffer [[slavery]] than commit suicide, how much rather must christians [[christian]], the worshippers of the true [[god]], the aspirants to a heavenly citizenship, shrink from this act, if in god's providence they have been for a season delivered into the hands of their enemies [[enemy]] to prove or to [[correct]] them! and, certainly, christians [[christian]] subjected to this humiliating condition will not be deserted by the most high, who for their sakes humbled himself. neither should they forget that they are bound by no laws [[law]] of [[war]], nor [[military]] orders, to put even a conquered [[enemy]] to the [[sword]]; and if a [[man]] may not put to [[death]] the [[enemy]] who has sinned, or may yet [[sin]] against him, who is so infatuated as to maintain that he may kill himself because an [[enemy]] has sinned, or is going to [[sin]], against him?

25. that we should not endeavour by [[sin]] to obviate [[sin]].

but, we are told, there is ground to [[fear]] that, when the [[body]] is subjected to the enemy's [[lust]], the insidious [[pleasure]] of sense may entice the [[soul]] to [[consent]] to the [[sin]], and steps must be taken to prevent so disastrous a result. and is not suicide the proper mode of preventing not only the enemy's [[sin]], but the [[sin]] of the [[christian]] so allured? now, in the first place, the [[soul]] which is [[led]] by [[god]] and his [[wisdom]], rather than by bodily concupiscence, will certainly never [[consent]] to the [[desire]] aroused in its own flesh by another's [[lust]]. and, at all events, if it be true, as the [[truth]] plainly declares, that suicide is a detestable and damnable wickedness, who is such a [[fool]] as to say, let us [[sin]] now, that we may obviate a possible future [[sin]]; let us now commit murder, lest we perhaps afterwards should commit adultery? if we are so controlled by [[iniquity]] that innocence is out of the [[question]], and we can at [[best]] but make a [[choice]] of sins [[sin]], is not a future and uncertain adultery preferable to a [[present]] and [[certain]] murder? is it not [[better]] to commit a wickedness which penitence may heal, than a crime which leaves no place for healing contrition? i say this for the sake of those [[men]] or [[women]] who [[fear]] they may be enticed into consenting to their violator's[pg 37] [[lust]], and [[think]] they should lay [[violent]] hands on themselves, and so prevent, not another's [[sin]], but their own. but far be it from the [[mind]] of a [[christian]] confiding in [[god]], and resting in the [[hope]] of his aid; far be it, i say, from such a [[mind]] to yield a shameful [[consent]] to pleasures [[pleasure]] of the flesh, howsoever presented. and if that lustful disobedience, which still dwells in our mortal members, follows its own [[law]] irrespective of our will, surely its motions in the [[body]] of one who rebels against them are as blameless as its motions in the [[body]] of one who sleeps.

26. that in [[certain]] peculiar cases the examples [[example]] of the saints are not to be followed.

but, they say, in the [[time]] of persecution some holy [[women]] escaped those who menaced them with outrage, by casting themselves into rivers which they knew would drown them; and having died in this manner, they are venerated in the [[church]] catholic as martyrs. of such persons [[person]] i do not presume to speak rashly. i cannot tell whether there may not have been vouchsafed to the [[church]] some [[divine]] [[authority]], proved by trustworthy evidences, for so honouring their memory: it may be that it is so. it may be they were not deceived by [[human]] [[judgment]], but prompted by [[divine]] [[wisdom]], to their act of self-destruction. we [[know]] that this was the case with samson. and when [[god]] enjoins any act, and intimates by plain evidence that he has enjoined it, who will call [[obedience]] [[criminal]]? who will accuse so [[religious]] a submission? but then every [[man]] is not justified in sacrificing his [[son]] to [[god]], because [[abraham]] was commendable in so doing. the soldier who has slain a [[man]] in [[obedience]] to the [[authority]] under which he is lawfully commissioned, is not accused of murder by any [[law]] of his [[state]]; nay, if he has not slain him, it is then he is accused of [[treason]] to the [[state]], and of despising the [[law]]. but if he has been acting on his own [[authority]], and at his own impulse, he has in this case incurred the crime of shedding [[human]] [[blood]]. and thus he is punished for doing without orders the very thing he is punished for neglecting to do when he has been ordered. if the commands of a general make so [[great]] a difference, shall the commands of [[god]] make none? he, then, who knows [[know]] it[pg 38] is unlawful to kill himself, may nevertheless do so if he is ordered by him whose commands we may not neglect. only let him be very sure that the [[divine]] command has been signified. as for us, we can become privy to the secrets of [[conscience]] only in so far as these are disclosed to us, and so far only do we [[judge]]: "no one knoweth the things of a [[man]], save the spirit of [[man]] which is in him."[75] but this we affirm, this we maintain, this we every way pronounce to be [[right]], that no [[man]] ought to inflict on himself voluntary [[death]], for this is to escape the ills of [[time]] by plunging into those of eternity; that no [[man]] ought to do so on account of another man's [[man]] sins [[sin]], for this were to escape a guilt which could not pollute him, by incurring [[great]] guilt of his own; that no [[man]] ought to do so on account of his own [[past]] sins [[sin]], for he has all the more need of this [[life]] that these sins [[sin]] may be healed by repentance; that no [[man]] should put an end to this [[life]] to obtain that [[better]] [[life]] we look for after [[death]], for those who [[die]] by their own hand have no [[better]] [[life]] after [[death]].

27. whether voluntary [[death]] should be sought in order to avoid [[sin]].

there remains one [[reason]] for suicide which i mentioned before, and which is [[thought]] a sound one,—namely, to prevent one's falling into [[sin]] either through the blandishments of [[pleasure]] or the [[violence]] of [[pain]]. if this [[reason]] were a [[good]] one, then we should be impelled to exhort [[men]] at once to [[destroy]] themselves, as soon as they have been washed in the laver of regeneration, and have received the forgiveness of all [[sin]]. then is the [[time]] to escape all future [[sin]], when all [[past]] [[sin]] is blotted out. and if this escape be lawfully secured by suicide, why not then specially? why does any baptized [[person]] hold his hand from taking his own [[life]]? why does any [[person]] who is freed from the hazards of this [[life]] again expose himself to them, when he has [[power]] so easily to rid himself of them all, and when it is written, "he who loveth danger shall fall into it?"[76] why does he [[love]], or at least face, so many serious dangers, by remaining in this [[life]] from which he may legitimately depart? but is any one so blinded and twisted in his [[moral]] [[nature]], and so far astray from the [[truth]],[pg 39] as to [[think]] that, though a [[man]] ought to make away with himself for [[fear]] of being [[led]] into [[sin]] by the oppression of one [[man]], his master, he ought yet to [[live]], and so expose himself to the hourly temptations of this [[world]], both to all those evils [[evil]] which the oppression of one master involves, and to numberless other miseries in which this [[life]] inevitably implicates us? what [[reason]], then, is there for our consuming [[time]] in those exhortations by which we seek to animate the baptized, either to virginal chastity, or vidual continence, or matrimonial fidelity, when we have so much more simple and compendious a method of deliverance from [[sin]], by persuading those who are fresh from baptism to put an end to their lives [[life]], and so pass to their [[lord]] pure and well-conditioned? if any one thinks [[think]] that such persuasion should be attempted, i say not he is foolish, but mad. with what face, then, can he say to any [[man]], "kill yourself, lest to your small sins [[sin]] you add a heinous [[sin]], while you [[live]] under an unchaste master, whose conduct is that of a barbarian?" how can he say this, if he cannot without wickedness say, "kill yourself, now that you are washed from all your sins [[sin]], lest you fall again into similar or even aggravated sins [[sin]], while you [[live]] in a [[world]] which has such [[power]] to allure by its unclean pleasures [[pleasure]], to torment by its horrible cruelties, to overcome by its errors and terrors?" it is wicked to say this; it is therefore wicked to kill oneself. for if there could be any just cause of suicide, this were so. and since not even this is so, there is none.

28. by what [[judgment]] of [[god]] the [[enemy]] was permitted to indulge his [[lust]] on the bodies [[body]] of continent christians [[christian]].

let not your [[life]], then, be a burden to you, ye faithful servants of [[christ]], though your chastity was made the [[sport]] of your enemies [[enemy]]. you have a grand and true consolation, if you maintain a [[good]] [[conscience]], and [[know]] that you did not [[consent]] to the sins [[sin]] of those who were permitted to commit sinful outrage upon you. and if you should ask why this permission was granted, indeed it is a deep providence of the creator and governor of the [[world]]; and "unsearchable are his judgments [[judgment]], and his ways [[past]] finding out."[77] nevertheless,[pg 40] faithfully interrogate your own souls [[soul]], whether ye have not been unduly puffed up by your integrity, and continence, and chastity; and whether ye have not been so desirous of the [[human]] [[praise]] that is accorded to these virtues [[virtue]], that ye have envied some who possessed them. i, for my part, do not [[know]] your hearts [[heart]], and therefore i make no accusation; i do not even hear what your hearts [[heart]] [[answer]] when you [[question]] them. and yet, if they [[answer]] that it is as i have supposed it might be, do not marvel that you have lost that by which you can [[win]] men's [[praise]], and retain that which cannot be exhibited to [[men]]. if you did not [[consent]] to [[sin]], it was because [[god]] added his aid to his grace that it might not be lost, and because shame before [[men]] succeeded to [[human]] [[glory]] that it might not be loved. but in both respects [[respect]] even the fainthearted among you have a consolation, approved by the one [[experience]], chastened by the other; justified by the one, corrected by the other. as to those whose hearts [[heart]], when interrogated, reply that they have never been proud of the [[virtue]] of virginity, widowhood, or matrimonial chastity, but, condescending to those of low estate, rejoiced with trembling in these gifts of [[god]], and that they have never envied any one the like excellences of [[sanctity]] and purity, but rose superior to [[human]] applause, which is wont to be abundant in proportion to the rarity of the [[virtue]] applauded, and rather [[desired]] that their own number be increased, than that by the smallness of their numbers each of them should be conspicuous;—even such faithful [[women]], i say, must not [[complain]] that permission was given to the barbarians so grossly to outrage them; nor must they allow themselves to [[believe]] that [[god]] overlooked their [[character]] when he permitted acts which no one with impunity commits. for some most flagrant and wicked desires [[desire]] are allowed [[free]] play at [[present]] by the secret [[judgment]] of [[god]], and are reserved to the [[public]] and final [[judgment]]. moreover, it is possible that those [[christian]] [[women]], who are unconscious of any undue [[pride]] on account of their [[virtuous]] chastity, whereby they sinlessly [[suffered]] the [[violence]] of their captors, had yet some lurking infirmity which might have betrayed them into a proud and contemptuous bearing, had they not been subjected to the humiliation that[pg 41] befell them in the taking of the [[city]]. as, therefore, some [[men]] were removed by [[death]], that no wickedness might [[change]] their disposition, so these [[women]] were outraged lest [[prosperity]] should [[corrupt]] their modesty. neither those [[women]], then, who were already puffed up by the circumstance that they were still virgins, nor those who might have been so puffed up had they not been exposed to the [[violence]] of the [[enemy]], lost their chastity, but rather gained [[humility]]: the former were saved from [[pride]] already cherished, the latter from [[pride]] that would shortly have grown upon them.

we must further notice that some of those sufferers may have conceived that continence is a bodily [[good]], and abides so long as the [[body]] is inviolate, and did not [[understand]] that the purity both of the [[body]] and the [[soul]] rests on the stedfastness of the will strengthened by god's grace, and cannot be forcibly taken from an unwilling [[person]]. from this error they are probably now delivered. for when they reflect how conscientiously they served [[god]], and when they settle again to the firm persuasion that he can in nowise desert those who so serve him, and so invoke his aid; and when they consider, what they cannot [[doubt]], how pleasing to him is chastity, they are shut up to the conclusion that he could never have permitted these disasters to befall his saints, if by them that saintliness could be destroyed which he himself had bestowed upon them, and delights to see in them.

29. what the servants of [[christ]] should say in reply to the unbelievers who cast in their teeth that [[christ]] did not rescue them from the fury of their enemies [[enemy]].

the whole [[family]] of [[god]], most high and most true, has therefore a consolation of its own,—a consolation which cannot [[deceive]], and which has in it a surer [[hope]] than the tottering and falling affairs of [[earth]] can afford. they will not refuse the discipline of this temporal [[life]], in which they are schooled for [[life]] eternal; nor will they lament their [[experience]] of it, for the [[good]] things of [[earth]] they use as pilgrims who are not detained by them, and its ills either prove or improve them. as for those who insult over them in their trials, and when ills befall them say, "where is thy [[god]]?"[78] we may ask them where their gods are when they suffer the very calamities for[pg 42] the sake of avoiding which they [[worship]] their gods, or maintain they ought to be worshipped; for the [[family]] of [[christ]] is furnished with its reply: our [[god]] is everywhere [[present]], wholly everywhere; not confined to any place. he can be [[present]] unperceived, and be absent without moving; when he exposes us to adversities, it is either to prove our perfections or [[correct]] our imperfections; and in return for our patient endurance of the sufferings of [[time]], he reserves for us an everlasting [[reward]]. but who are you, that we should deign to speak with you even about your own gods, much less about our [[god]], who is "to be feared above all gods? for all the gods of the nations are idols; but the [[lord]] made the heavens [[heaven]]."[79]

30. that those who [[complain]] of [[christianity]] really [[desire]] to [[live]] without restraint in shameful luxury.

if the famous scipio nasica were now alive, who was once your pontiff, and was unanimously chosen by the senate, when, in the panic created by the punic [[war]], they sought for the [[best]] citizen to entertain the phrygian [[goddess]], he would curb this shamelessness of yours, though you would perhaps scarcely dare to look upon the countenance of such a [[man]]. for why in your calamities do you [[complain]] of [[christianity]], unless because you [[desire]] to enjoy your luxurious licence unrestrained, and to lead an abandoned and profligate [[life]] without the interruption of any uneasiness or disaster? for certainly your [[desire]] for [[peace]], and [[prosperity]], and plenty is not prompted by any [[purpose]] of using these blessings honestly, that is to say, with moderation, sobriety, temperance, and piety; for your [[purpose]] rather is to run riot in an endless variety of sottish pleasures [[pleasure]], and thus to generate from your [[prosperity]] a [[moral]] pestilence which will prove a thousand-fold more disastrous than the fiercest enemies [[enemy]]. it was such a calamity as this that scipio, your [[chief]] pontiff, your [[best]] [[man]] in the [[judgment]] of the whole senate, feared when he refused to agree to the destruction of [[carthage]], rome's rival; and opposed cato, who advised its destruction. he feared security, that [[enemy]] of [[weak]] minds [[mind]], and he perceived that a wholesome [[fear]] would be a fit guardian for the [[citizens]]. and[pg 43] he was not mistaken: the event proved how wisely he had spoken. for when [[carthage]] was destroyed, and the roman [[republic]] delivered from its [[great]] cause of [[anxiety]], a crowd of disastrous evils [[evil]] forthwith resulted from the prosperous condition of things. first concord was weakened, and destroyed by fierce and bloody seditions; then followed, by a concatenation of baleful causes, civil wars [[war]], which brought in their train such massacres, such bloodshed, such lawless and cruel proscription and plunder, that those romans who, in the days of their [[virtue]], had expected injury only at the hands of their enemies [[enemy]], now that their [[virtue]] was lost, [[suffered]] greater cruelties at the hands of their fellow-citizens. the [[lust]] of [[rule]], which with other vices [[vice]] existed among the romans in more unmitigated intensity than among any other [[people]], after it had taken possession of the more powerful few, subdued under its yoke the rest, worn and wearied.

31. by what steps the passion for governing increased among the romans.

for at what stage would that passion rest when once it has lodged in a proud spirit, until by a succession of advances it has reached even the [[throne]]? and to obtain such advances nothing avails but unscrupulous [[ambition]]. but unscrupulous [[ambition]] has nothing to [[work]] upon, save in a nation corrupted by avarice and luxury. moreover, a [[people]] becomes avaricious and luxurious by [[prosperity]]; and it was this which that very prudent [[man]] nasica was endeavouring to avoid when he opposed the destruction of the [[greatest]], strongest, wealthiest [[city]] of rome's [[enemy]]. he [[thought]] that thus [[fear]] would act as a curb on [[lust]], and that [[lust]] being curbed would not run riot in luxury, and that luxury being prevented avarice would be at an end; and that these vices [[vice]] being [[banished]], [[virtue]] would flourish and increase, to the [[great]] [[profit]] of the [[state]]; and [[liberty]], the fit companion of [[virtue]], would abide unfettered. for similar reasons [[reason]], and animated by the same considerate [[patriotism]], that same [[chief]] pontiff of yours—i still refer to him who was adjudged rome's [[best]] [[man]] without one dissentient voice—threw cold water on the proposal of the senate to build a circle of seats round the theatre, and in a very weighty [[speech]] warned them against allowing the luxurious[pg 44] manners of greece to sap the roman manliness, and persuaded them not to yield to the enervating and emasculating influence of [[foreign]] licentiousness. so authoritative and forcible were his words, that the senate was moved to prohibit the use even of those benches which hitherto had been customarily brought to the theatre for the temporary use of the [[citizens]].[80] how eagerly would such a [[man]] as this have [[banished]] from [[rome]] the scenic exhibitions themselves, had he dared to oppose the [[authority]] of those whom he supposed to be gods! for he did not [[know]] that they were malicious devils [[devil]]; or if he did, he supposed they should rather be propitiated than despised. for there had not yet been revealed to the gentiles the heavenly doctrine which should purify their hearts [[heart]] by [[faith]], and transform their [[natural]] disposition by humble godliness, and turn them from the service of proud devils [[devil]] to seek the things that are in [[heaven]], or even above the heavens [[heaven]].

32. of the establishment of scenic entertainments.

know then, ye who are ignorant of this, and ye who feign ignorance be reminded, while you murmur against him who has freed you from such rulers, that the scenic games, exhibitions of shameless folly and licence, were established at [[rome]], not by men's vicious cravings, but by the appointment of your gods. much more pardonably might you have rendered [[divine]] honours [[honour]] to scipio than to such gods as these. the gods were not so [[moral]] as their pontiff. but give me now your attention, if your [[mind]], inebriated by its deep potations of error, can take in any sober [[truth]]. the gods enjoined that games be exhibited in their [[honour]] to stay a physical pestilence; their pontiff prohibited the theatre from being constructed, to prevent a [[moral]] pestilence. if, then, there remains in you sufficient mental enlightenment to prefer the [[soul]] to the [[body]], choose whom you will [[worship]]. besides, though the pestilence was stayed, this was not because the voluptuous madness of stage-plays had taken possession of a warlike [[people]] hitherto accustomed only to the games of the circus; but these astute and wicked spirits, foreseeing that in due[pg 45] course the pestilence would shortly cease, took [[occasion]] to infect, not the bodies [[body]], but the morals [[moral]] of their worshippers, with a far more serious disease. and in this pestilence these gods find [[great]] enjoyment, because it benighted the minds [[mind]] of [[men]] with so gross a darkness, and dishonoured them with so foul a deformity, that even quite recently (will [[posterity]] be able to credit it?) some of those who fled from the sack of [[rome]] and found refuge in [[carthage]], were so infected with this disease, that day after day they seemed to contend with one another who should most madly run after the actors in the theatres.

33. that the overthrow of [[rome]] has not corrected the vices [[vice]] of the romans.

oh infatuated [[men]], what is this blindness, or rather madness, which possesses you? how is it that while, as we hear, even the eastern nations are bewailing your ruin, and while powerful states in the most remote parts of the [[earth]] are mourning your fall as a [[public]] calamity, ye yourselves should be crowding to the theatres, should be pouring into them and filling them; and, in short, be playing a madder part now than ever before? this was the foul plague-spot, this the wreck of [[virtue]] and [[honour]] that scipio sought to preserve you from when he prohibited the construction of theatres; this was his [[reason]] for desiring that you might still have an [[enemy]] to [[fear]], seeing as he did how easily [[prosperity]] would [[corrupt]] and [[destroy]] you. he did not consider that [[republic]] flourishing whose walls stand, but whose morals [[moral]] are in ruins. but the seductions of evil-minded devils [[devil]] had more influence with you than the precautions of prudent [[men]]. hence the injuries you do, you will not permit to be imputed to you; but the injuries you suffer, you impute to [[christianity]]. depraved by [[good]] [[fortune]], and not chastened by adversity, what you [[desire]] in the restoration of a peaceful and secure [[state]], is not the tranquillity of the commonwealth, but the impunity of your own vicious luxury. scipio wished you to be hard pressed by an [[enemy]], that you might not abandon yourselves to luxurious manners; but so abandoned are you, that not even when crushed by the [[enemy]] is your luxury repressed. you have missed the [[profit]] of your calamity; you have been made most wretched, and have remained most profligate.

[pg 46]

34. of god's clemency in moderating the ruin of the [[city]].

and that you are yet alive is due to [[god]], who spares you that you may be admonished to repent and reform your lives [[life]]. it is he who has permitted you, ungrateful as you are, to escape the [[sword]] of the [[enemy]], by calling yourselves his servants, or by finding asylum in the [[sacred]] places of the martyrs.

it is said that romulus and remus, in order to increase the [[population]] of the [[city]] they founded, opened a sanctuary in which every [[man]] might find asylum and absolution of all crime,—a remarkable foreshadowing of what has recently occurred in [[honour]] of [[christ]]. the destroyers of [[rome]] followed the [[example]] of its founders. but it was not greatly to their credit that the latter, for the sake of increasing the number of their [[citizens]], did that which the former have done, lest the number of their enemies [[enemy]] should be diminished.

35. of the sons [[son]] of the [[church]] who are hidden among the wicked, and of false christians [[christian]] within the [[church]].

let these and similar answers [[answer]] (if any fuller and fitter answers [[answer]] can be found) be given to their enemies [[enemy]] by the redeemed [[family]] of the [[lord]] [[christ]], and by the pilgrim [[city]] of [[king]] [[christ]]. but let this [[city]] bear in [[mind]], that among her enemies [[enemy]] [[lie]] hid those who are destined to be fellow-citizens, that she may not [[think]] it a fruitless [[labour]] to bear what they inflict as enemies [[enemy]] until they become confessors of the [[faith]]. so, too, as long as she is a stranger in the [[world]], the [[city]] of [[god]] has in her communion, and bound to her by the sacraments, some who shall not eternally dwell in the lot of the saints. of these, some are not now recognised; others declare themselves, and do not hesitate to make [[common]] cause with our enemies [[enemy]] in murmuring against [[god]], whose sacramental badge they wear. these [[men]] you may to-day see thronging the churches [[church]] with us, to-morrow crowding the theatres with the godless. but we have the less [[reason]] to despair of the reclamation even of such persons [[person]], if among our most declared enemies [[enemy]] there are now some, unknown to themselves, who are destined to become our [[friends]]. in [[truth]], these two cities [[city]] are entangled together in this [[world]], and intermixed until the [[last]] [[judgment]] effect their separation. i now proceed to speak, as [[god]] shall [[help]] me, of the rise, [[progress]], and end[pg 47] of these two cities [[city]]; and what i write, i write for the [[glory]] of the [[city]] of [[god]], that, being placed in comparison with the other, it may shine with a brighter lustre.

36. what subjects [[subject]] are to be handled in the following discourse.

but i have still some things to say in confutation of those who refer the disasters of the roman [[republic]] to our [[religion]], because it prohibits the offering of sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to the gods. for this end i must recount all, or as many as may seem sufficient, of the disasters which befell that [[city]] and its [[subject]] provinces, before these sacrifices [[sacrifice]] were prohibited; for all these disasters they would doubtless have attributed to us, if at that [[time]] our [[religion]] had shed its [[light]] upon them, and had prohibited their sacrifices [[sacrifice]]. i must then go on to show what social well-being the true [[god]], in whose hand are all kingdoms [[kingdom]], vouchsafed to grant to them that their [[empire]] might increase. i must show why he did so, and how their false gods, instead of at all aiding them, greatly injured them by guile and deceit. and, lastly, i must meet those who, when on this point convinced and confuted by irrefragable proofs, endeavour to maintain that they [[worship]] the gods, not hoping for the [[present]] advantages of this [[life]], but for those which are to be enjoyed after [[death]]. and this, if i am not mistaken, will be the most difficult part of my task, and will be worthy of the loftiest argument; for we must then enter the lists with the [[philosophers]], not the mere [[common]] herd of [[philosophers]], but the most renowned, who in many points agree with ourselves, as regarding the immortality of the [[soul]], and that the true [[god]] created the [[world]], and by his providence rules [[rule]] all he has created. but as they differ from us on other points, we must not shrink from the task of exposing their errors, that, having refuted the gainsaying of the wicked with such ability as [[god]] may vouchsafe, we may assert the [[city]] of [[god]], and true piety, and the [[worship]] of [[god]], to which alone the promise of true and everlasting felicity is attached. here, then, let us conclude, that we may enter on these subjects [[subject]] in a fresh [[book]].

[pg 48]

book second.

argument.

in this [[book]] augustine reviews those calamities which the romans [[suffered]] before the [[time]] of [[christ]], and while the [[worship]] of the false gods was universally practised; and demonstrates that, far from being preserved from misfortune by the gods, the romans have been by them overwhelmed with the only, or at least the [[greatest]], of all calamities—the [[corruption]] of manners, and the vices [[vice]] of the [[soul]].

1. of the limits which must be put to the necessity of replying to an adversary.

if the feeble [[mind]] of [[man]] did not presume to resist the clear evidence of [[truth]], but yielded its infirmity to wholesome doctrines, as to a health-giving medicine, until it obtained from [[god]], by its [[faith]] and piety, the grace needed to heal it, they who have just ideas [[idea]], and express them in suitable [[language]], would need to use no long discourse to refute the errors of empty conjecture. but this mental infirmity is now more prevalent and hurtful than ever, to such an extent that even after the [[truth]] has been as fully demonstrated as [[man]] can prove it to [[man]], they hold for the very [[truth]] their own unreasonable fancies, either on account of their [[great]] blindness, which prevents them from seeing what is plainly set before them, or on account of their opinionative obstinacy, which prevents them from acknowledging the [[force]] of what they do see. there therefore frequently arises a necessity of speaking more fully on those points which are already clear, that we may, as it were, [[present]] them not to the eye, but even to the touch, so that they may be [[felt]] even by those who close their [[eyes]] against them. and yet to what end shall we ever bring our discussions, or what bounds can be set to our discourse, if we proceed on the [[principle]] that we must always reply to those who reply to us? for those who are either unable to [[understand]] our arguments, or are so hardened by the habit of contradiction,[pg 49] that though they [[understand]] they cannot yield to them, reply to us, and, as it is written, "speak hard things,"[81] and are incorrigibly [[vain]]. now, if we were to propose to confute their objections as often as they with brazen face chose to disregard our arguments, and as often as they could by any means contradict our statements, you see how endless, and fruitless, and painful a task we should be undertaking. and therefore i do not [[wish]] my writings to be judged even by you, my [[son]] marcellinus, nor by any of those others at whose service this [[work]] of mine is freely and in all [[christian]] charity put, if at least you intend always to require a reply to every exception which you hear taken to what you [[read]] in it; for so you would become like those silly [[women]] of whom the apostle says that they are "always learning, and never able to come to the [[knowledge]] of the [[truth]]."[82]

2. recapitulation of the contents of the first [[book]].

in the foregoing [[book]], having begun to speak of the [[city]] of [[god]], to which i have resolved, [[heaven]] helping me, to consecrate the whole of this [[work]], it was my first endeavour to reply to those who attribute the wars [[war]] by which the [[world]] is being devastated, and specially the recent sack of [[rome]] by the barbarians, to the [[religion]] of [[christ]], which prohibits the offering of abominable sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to devils [[devil]]. i have shown that they ought rather to attribute it to [[christ]], that for his name's sake the barbarians, in contravention of all custom and [[law]] of [[war]], threw open as sanctuaries the largest churches [[church]], and in many instances showed such reverence to [[christ]], that not only his [[genuine]] servants, but even those who in their terror feigned themselves to be so, were exempted from all those hardships which by the custom of [[war]] may lawfully be inflicted. then out of this there arose the [[question]], why wicked and ungrateful [[men]] were permitted to share in these benefits; and why, too, the hardships and calamities of [[war]] were inflicted on the godly as well as on the ungodly. and in giving a suitably full [[answer]] to this large [[question]], i occupied some considerable space, partly that i might relieve the anxieties which disturb many when they observe that the blessings of [[god]], and the [[common]] and daily [[human]] casualties,[pg 50] fall to the lot of [[bad]] [[men]] and [[good]] without distinction; but mainly that i might minister some consolation to those holy and chaste [[women]] who were outraged by the [[enemy]], in such a way as to shock their modesty, though not to sully their purity, and that i might preserve them from being ashamed of [[life]], though they have no guilt to be ashamed of. and then i briefly spoke against those who with a most shameless wantonness insult over those [[poor]] christians [[christian]] who were subjected to those calamities, and especially over those broken-hearted and humiliated, though chaste and holy [[women]]; these fellows themselves being most depraved and unmanly profligates, quite degenerate from the [[genuine]] romans, whose famous deeds are abundantly recorded in [[history]], and everywhere celebrated, but who have found in their descendants the [[greatest]] enemies [[enemy]] of their [[glory]]. in [[truth]], [[rome]], which was founded and increased by the labours [[labour]] of these ancient heroes, was more shamefully ruined by their descendants, while its walls were still standing, than it is now by the razing of them. for in this ruin there fell stones and timbers; but in the ruin those profligates effected, there fell, not the mural, but the [[moral]] bulwarks and ornaments of the [[city]], and their hearts [[heart]] burned with [[passions]] more destructive than the flames which consumed their houses. thus i brought my first [[book]] to a close. and now i go on to speak of those calamities which that [[city]] itself, or its [[subject]] provinces, have [[suffered]] since its foundation; all of which they would equally have attributed to the [[christian]] [[religion]], if at that early period the doctrine of the gospel against their false and deceiving gods had been as largely and freely proclaimed as now.

3. that we need only to [[read]] [[history]] in order to see what calamities the romans [[suffered]] before the [[religion]] of [[christ]] began to compete with the [[worship]] of the gods.

but [[remember]] that, in recounting these things, i have still to address myself to ignorant [[men]]; so ignorant, indeed, as to give birth to the [[common]] saying, "drought and [[christianity]] go hand in hand."[83] there are indeed some among them who[pg 51] are thoroughly well educated [[men]], and have a taste for [[history]], in which the things i speak of are open to their observation; but in order to irritate the uneducated masses against us, they feign ignorance of these events, and do what they can to make the vulgar [[believe]] that those disasters, which in [[certain]] places and at [[certain]] times [[time]] uniformly befall [[mankind]], are the result of [[christianity]], which is being everywhere diffused, and is possessed of a renown and brilliancy which quite eclipse their own gods.[84] let them then, along with us, call to [[mind]] with what various and repeated disasters the [[prosperity]] of [[rome]] was blighted, before ever [[christ]] had come in the flesh, and before his name had been blazoned among the nations with that [[glory]] which they vainly grudge. let them, if they can, defend their gods in this article, since they maintain that they [[worship]] them in order to be preserved from these disasters, which they now impute to us if they suffer in the least [[degree]]. for why did these gods permit the disasters i am to speak of to fall on their worshippers before the preaching of christ's name offended them, and put an end to their sacrifices [[sacrifice]]?

4. that the worshippers of the gods never received from them any healthy [[moral]] precepts, and that in celebrating their [[worship]] all sorts of impurities were practised.

first of all, we would ask why their gods took no steps to improve the morals [[moral]] of their worshippers. that the true [[god]] should neglect those who did not seek his [[help]], that was but [[justice]]; but why did those gods, from whose [[worship]] ungrateful [[men]] are now complaining that they are prohibited, issue no laws [[law]] which might have guided their devotees to a [[virtuous]] [[life]]? surely it was but just, that such [[care]] as [[men]] showed to the [[worship]] of the gods, the gods on their part should have to the conduct of [[men]]. but, it is replied, it is by his own will a [[man]] goes astray. who denies it? but none the less was it incumbent on these gods, who were men's guardians, to publish in plain terms the laws [[law]] of a [[good]] [[life]], and not to[pg 52] conceal them from their worshippers. it was their part to send prophets [[prophet]] to reach and convict such as broke these laws [[law]], and publicly to proclaim the punishments [[punishment]] which await evildoers, and the rewards [[reward]] which may be looked for by those that do well. did ever the walls of any of their temples echo to any such warning voice? i myself, when i was a [[young]] [[man]], used sometimes to go to the sacrilegious entertainments and spectacles; i saw the priests [[priest]] raving in [[religious]] excitement, and heard the choristers; i took [[pleasure]] in the shameful games which were celebrated in [[honour]] of gods and goddesses [[goddess]], of the virgin cœlestis,[85] and berecynthia,[86] the [[mother]] of all the gods. and on the holy day consecrated to her purification, there were sung before her couch productions so obscene and filthy for the ear—i do not say of the [[mother]] of the gods, but of the [[mother]] of any senator or honest man—nay, so impure, that not even the [[mother]] of the foul-mouthed players themselves could have formed one of the audience. for [[natural]] reverence for parents is a bond which the most abandoned cannot ignore. and, accordingly, the lewd actions and filthy words with which these players honoured the [[mother]] of the gods, in presence of a vast assemblage and audience of both sexes [[sex]], they could not for very shame have rehearsed at [[home]] in presence of their own mothers [[mother]]. and the crowds that were gathered from all quarters by curiosity, offended modesty must, i should suppose, have scattered in the confusion of shame. if these are [[sacred]] rites, what is sacrilege? if this is purification, what is pollution? this festivity was called the tables,[87] as if a banquet were being given at which unclean devils [[devil]] might find suitable refreshment. for it is not difficult[pg 53] to see what [[kind]] of spirits they must be who are delighted with such obscenities, unless, indeed, a [[man]] be blinded by these [[evil]] spirits passing themselves off under the name of gods, and either disbelieves in their existence, or leads such a [[life]] as prompts him rather to propitiate and [[fear]] them than the true [[god]].

5. of the obscenities practised in [[honour]] of the [[mother]] of the gods.

in this matter i would prefer to have as my assessors in [[judgment]], not those [[men]] who rather take [[pleasure]] in these infamous customs than take pains [[pain]] to put an end to them, but that same scipio nasica who was chosen by the senate as the citizen most worthy to receive in his hands the image of that demon cybele, and convey it into the [[city]]. he would tell us whether he would be proud to see his own [[mother]] so highly esteemed by the [[state]] as to have [[divine]] honours [[honour]] adjudged to her; as the greeks [[greek]] and romans and other nations have decreed [[divine]] honours [[honour]] to [[men]] who had been of material service to them, and have believed that their mortal benefactors were thus made [[immortal]], and enrolled among the gods.[88] surely he would [[desire]] that his [[mother]] should enjoy such felicity were it possible. but if we proceeded to ask him whether, among the honours [[honour]] paid to her, he would [[wish]] such shameful rites as these to be celebrated, would he not at once exclaim that he would rather his [[mother]] lay stone-dead, than survive as a [[goddess]] to lend her ear to these obscenities? is it possible that he who was of so severe a morality, that he used his influence as a roman senator to prevent the building of a theatre in that [[city]] dedicated to the manly virtues [[virtue]], would [[wish]] his [[mother]] to be propitiated as a [[goddess]] with words which would have brought the blush to her cheek when a roman matron? could he possibly [[believe]] that the modesty of an estimable woman would be so transformed by her promotion to divinity, that she would suffer herself to be invoked and celebrated in terms so gross and immodest, that if she had heard the like while alive upon [[earth]], and had listened without stopping her ears and hurrying from the spot, her relatives, her husband, and her [[children]] would have[pg 54] blushed for her? therefore, the [[mother]] of the gods being such a [[character]] as the most profligate [[man]] would be ashamed to have for his [[mother]], and meaning to enthral the minds [[mind]] of the romans, demanded for her service their [[best]] citizen, not to ripen him still more in [[virtue]] by her helpful counsel, but to entangle him by her deceit, like her of whom it is written, "the adulteress will hunt for the precious [[soul]]."[89] her intent was to puff up this high-souled [[man]] by an apparently [[divine]] testimony to his excellence, in order that he might rely upon his own eminence in [[virtue]], and make no further efforts after true piety and [[religion]], without which [[natural]] genius, however brilliant, vapours into [[pride]] and comes to nothing. for what but a guileful [[purpose]] could that [[goddess]] demand the [[best]] [[man]], seeing that in her own [[sacred]] festivals she requires such obscenities as the [[best]] [[men]] would be covered with shame to hear at their own tables?

6. that the gods of the pagans never inculcated holiness of [[life]].

this is the [[reason]] why those divinities quite neglected the lives [[life]] and morals [[moral]] of the cities [[city]] and nations who worshipped them, and threw no dreadful prohibition in their way to hinder them from becoming utterly [[corrupt]], and to preserve them from those terrible and detestable evils [[evil]] which visit not harvests and vintages, not house and possessions, not the [[body]] which is [[subject]] to the [[soul]], but the [[soul]] itself, the spirit that rules [[rule]] the whole [[man]]. if there was any such prohibition, let it be produced, let it be proved. they will tell us that purity and probity were inculcated upon those who were initiated in the mysteries of [[religion]], and that secret incitements to [[virtue]] were whispered in the ear of the élite; but this is an idle boast. let them show or name to us the places which were at any [[time]] consecrated to assemblages in which, instead of the obscene songs [[song]] and licentious acting of players, instead of the celebration of those most filthy and shameless fugalia[pg 55][90] (well called fugalia, since they banish modesty and [[right]] feeling), the [[people]] were commanded in the name of the gods to restrain avarice, bridle impurity, and conquer [[ambition]]; where, in short, they might learn in that school which persius vehemently lashes them to, when he says: "be taught, ye abandoned creatures, and ascertain the causes of things; what we are, and for what end we are born; what is the [[law]] of our [[success]] in [[life]], and by what art [[arts]] we may turn the goal without making shipwreck; what limit we should put to our [[wealth]], what we may lawfully [[desire]], and what uses filthy lucre serves; how much we should bestow upon our [[country]] and our [[family]]; learn, in short, what [[god]] meant thee to be, and what place he has ordered you to fill."[91] let them name to us the places where such instructions were wont to be communicated from the gods, and where the [[people]] who worshipped them were accustomed to resort to hear them, as we can point to our churches [[church]] built for this [[purpose]] in every [[land]] where the [[christian]] [[religion]] is received.

7. that the suggestions of [[philosophers]] are precluded from having any [[moral]] effect, because they have not the [[authority]] which belongs to [[divine]] instruction, and because man's [[man]] [[natural]] bias to [[evil]] induces him rather to [[follow]] the examples [[example]] of the gods than to obey the precepts of [[men]].

but will they perhaps remind us of the schools of the [[philosophers]], and their disputations? in the first place, these belong not to [[rome]], but to greece; and even if we yield to them that they are now roman, because greece itself has become a roman province, still the teachings of the [[philosophers]] are not the commandments of the gods, but the discoveries of [[men]], who, at the prompting of their own speculative ability, made efforts to discover the hidden laws [[law]] of [[nature]], and the [[right]] and [[wrong]] in ethics, and in dialectic what was consequent according to the rules [[rule]] of [[logic]], and what was inconsequent and erroneous. and some of them, by god's [[help]], made [[great]] discoveries; but when left to themselves they were betrayed by [[human]] infirmity, and fell into mistakes. and this was ordered by [[divine]] providence, that their [[pride]] might be restrained, and that by their [[example]] it might be pointed out that it is [[humility]] which has access to the highest regions.[pg 56] but of this we shall have more to say, if the [[lord]] [[god]] of [[truth]] permit, in its own place.[92] however, if the [[philosophers]] have made any discoveries which are sufficient to guide [[men]] to [[virtue]] and blessedness, would it not have been greater [[justice]] to vote [[divine]] honours [[honour]] to them? were it not more accordant with every [[virtuous]] sentiment to [[read]] plato's writings in a "temple of [[plato]]," than to be [[present]] in the temples of devils [[devil]] to witness the priests [[priest]] of cybele[93] mutilating themselves, the effeminate being consecrated, the raving fanatics cutting themselves, and whatever other cruel or shameful, or shamefully cruel or cruelly shameful, [[ceremony]] is enjoined by the ritual of such gods as these? were it not a more suitable [[education]], and more likely to prompt the [[youth]] to [[virtue]], if they heard [[public]] recitals of the laws [[law]] of the gods, instead of the [[vain]] laudation of the customs and laws [[law]] of their [[ancestors]]? certainly all the worshippers of the roman gods, when once they are possessed by what persius calls "the burning poison of [[lust]],"[94] prefer to witness the deeds of [[jupiter]] rather than to hear what [[plato]] taught or cato censured. hence the [[young]] profligate in terence, when he sees on the wall a fresco representing the fabled descent of [[jupiter]] into the lap of danaë in the form of a golden shower, accepts this as authoritative precedent for his own licentiousness, and boasts that he is an imitator of [[god]]. "and what [[god]]?" he says. "he who with his thunder shakes the loftiest temples. and was i, a [[poor]] creature compared to him, to make bones of it? no; i did it, and with all my [[heart]]."[95]

[pg 57]

8. that the theatrical exhibitions publishing the shameful actions of the gods, propitiated rather than offended them.

but, some one will interpose, these are the fables of poets, not the deliverances of the gods themselves. well, i have no [[mind]] to arbitrate between the lewdness of theatrical entertainments and of mystic rites; only this i say, and [[history]] bears me out in making the assertion, that those same entertainments, in which the fictions of poets are the main attraction, were not introduced in the festivals of the gods by the ignorant devotion of the romans, but that the gods themselves gave the most urgent commands to this effect, and indeed extorted from the romans these solemnities and celebrations in their [[honour]]. i touched on this in the preceding [[book]], and mentioned that dramatic entertainments were first inaugurated at [[rome]] on [[occasion]] of a pestilence, and by [[authority]] of the pontiff. and what [[man]] is there who is not more likely to adopt, for the regulation of his own [[life]], the examples [[example]] that are represented in plays which have a [[divine]] sanction, rather than the precepts written and promulgated with no more than [[human]] [[authority]]? if the poets gave a false representation of jove in describing him as adulterous, then it were to be expected that the chaste gods should in anger avenge so wicked a fiction, in place of encouraging the games which circulated it. of these plays, the most inoffensive are comedies and tragedies, that is to say, the dramas which poets write for the stage, and which, though they often handle impure subjects [[subject]], yet do so without the filthiness of [[language]] which characterizes many other performances; and it is these dramas which boys are obliged by their seniors to [[read]] and learn as a part of what is called a liberal and gentlemanly [[education]].[96]

9. that the poetical licence which the greeks [[greek]], in [[obedience]] to their gods, allowed, was restrained by the ancient romans.

the [[opinion]] of the ancient romans on this matter is attested by cicero in his [[work]] de republica, in which scipio, one of the interlocutors, says, "the lewdness of comedy could never have been [[suffered]] by audiences, unless the customs of [[society]] had previously sanctioned the same lewdness." and[pg 58] in the earlier days the greeks [[greek]] preserved a [[certain]] reasonableness in their licence, and made it a [[law]], that whatever comedy wished to say of any one, it must say it of him by name. and so in the same [[work]] of cicero's, scipio says, "whom has it not aspersed? nay, whom has it not worried? whom has it spared? allow that it may assail demagogues and factions, [[men]] injurious to the commonwealth—a cleon, a cleophon, a hyperbolus. that is tolerable, though it had been more seemly for the [[public]] censor to brand such [[men]], than for a poet to lampoon them; but to blacken the fame of pericles with scurrilous verse, after he had with the utmost [[dignity]] presided over their [[state]] alike in [[war]] and in [[peace]], was as unworthy of a poet, as if our own plautus or nævius were to bring publius and cneius scipio on the comic stage, or as if cæcilius were to caricature cato." and then a little after he goes on: "though our twelve tables attached the penalty of [[death]] only to a very few offences, yet among these few this was one: if any [[man]] should have sung a pasquinade, or have composed a satire calculated to bring infamy or disgrace on another [[person]]. wisely decreed. for it is by the decisions of magistrates, and by a well-informed [[justice]], that our lives [[life]] ought to be judged, and not by the flighty fancies of poets; neither ought we to be exposed to hear calumnies, save where we have the [[liberty]] of replying, and defending ourselves before an adequate tribunal." this much i have judged it advisable to quote from the fourth [[book]] of cicero's de republica; and i have made the quotation word for word, with the exception of some words omitted, and some slightly transposed, for the sake of giving the sense more readily. and certainly the extract is pertinent to the matter i am endeavouring to explain. cicero makes some further remarks, and concludes the passage by showing that the ancient romans did not permit any living [[man]] to be either praised or blamed on the stage. but the greeks [[greek]], as i said, though not so [[moral]], were more logical in allowing this licence which the romans forbade: for they saw that their gods approved and enjoyed the scurrilous [[language]] of low comedy when directed not only against [[men]], but even against themselves; and this, whether the infamous actions imputed to them were the fictions of[pg 59] poets, or were their actual iniquities commemorated and acted in the theatres. and would that the spectators had judged them worthy only of laughter, and not of imitation! manifestly it had been a stretch of [[pride]] to spare the [[good]] name of the leading [[men]] and the [[common]] [[citizens]], when the very deities did not grudge that their own [[reputation]] should be blemished.

10. that the devils [[devil]], in suffering either false or true crimes to be laid to their charge, meant to do [[men]] a mischief.

it is alleged, in excuse of this practice, that the stories told of the gods are not true, but false, and mere inventions; but this only makes matters worse, if we form our estimate by the morality our [[religion]] teaches [[teach]]; and if we consider the malice of the devils [[devil]], what more wily and astute artifice could they practise upon [[men]]? when a slander is uttered against a leading statesman of upright and useful [[life]], is it not reprehensible in proportion to its untruth and groundlessness? what [[punishment]], then, shall be sufficient when the gods are the objects of so wicked and outrageous an [[injustice]]? but the devils [[devil]], whom these [[men]] repute gods, are content that even iniquities they are guiltless of should be ascribed to them, so long as they may entangle men's minds [[mind]] in the meshes of these opinions [[opinion]], and draw them on along with themselves to their predestinated [[punishment]]: whether such things were actually committed by the [[men]] whom these devils [[devil]], delighting in [[human]] infatuation, cause to be worshipped as gods, and in whose stead they, by a thousand malign and deceitful artifices, substitute themselves, and so receive [[worship]]; or whether, though they were really the crimes of [[men]], these wicked spirits gladly allowed them to be attributed to higher beings, that there might seem to be conveyed from [[heaven]] itself a sufficient sanction for the perpetration of shameful wickedness. the greeks [[greek]], therefore, seeing the [[character]] of the gods they served, [[thought]] that the poets should certainly not refrain from showing up [[human]] vices [[vice]] on the stage, either because they [[desired]] to be like their gods in this, or because they were afraid that, if they required for themselves a more unblemished [[reputation]] than they asserted for the gods, they might provoke them to anger.

[pg 60]

11. that the greeks [[greek]] admitted players to offices of [[state]], on the ground that [[men]] who pleased the gods should not be contemptuously treated by their fellows.

it was a part of this same reasonableness of the greeks [[greek]] which induced them to bestow upon the actors of these same plays no inconsiderable civic honours [[honour]]. in the above-mentioned [[book]] of the de republica, it is mentioned that æschines, a very eloquent athenian, who had been a tragic actor in his [[youth]], became a statesman, and that the athenians again and again sent another tragedian, aristodemus, as their plenipotentiary to philip. for they judged it unbecoming to condemn and treat as infamous persons [[person]] those who were the [[chief]] actors in the scenic entertainments which they saw to be so pleasing to the gods. no [[doubt]] this was immoral of the greeks [[greek]], but there can be as little [[doubt]] they acted in conformity with the [[character]] of their gods; for how could they have presumed to [[protect]] the conduct of the [[citizens]] from being cut to pieces by the tongues of poets and players, who were allowed, and even enjoined by the gods, to tear their [[divine]] [[reputation]] to tatters? and how could they hold in contempt the [[men]] who acted in the theatres those dramas which, as they had ascertained, gave [[pleasure]] to the gods whom they worshipped? nay, how could they but grant to them the highest civic honours [[honour]]? on what plea could they [[honour]] the priests [[priest]] who offered for them acceptable sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to the gods, if they branded with infamy the actors who in behalf of the [[people]] gave to the gods that [[pleasure]] or [[honour]] which they demanded, and which, according to the account of the priests [[priest]], they were angry at not receiving? labeo,[97] whose learning makes him an [[authority]] on such points, is of [[opinion]] that the distinction between [[good]] and [[evil]] deities should find expression in a difference of [[worship]]; that the [[evil]] should be propitiated by bloody sacrifices [[sacrifice]] and doleful rites, but the [[good]] with a joyful and pleasant observance, as, e.g. (as he says himself), with plays, festivals, and banquets.[98] all this we shall,[pg 61] with god's [[help]], hereafter discuss. at [[present]], and speaking to the [[subject]] on hand, whether all kinds [[kind]] of offerings are made indiscriminately to all the gods, as if all were [[good]] (and it is an unseemly thing to conceive that there are [[evil]] gods; but these gods of the pagans are all [[evil]], because they are not gods, but [[evil]] spirits), or whether, as labeo thinks [[think]], a distinction is made between the offerings presented to the different gods, the greeks [[greek]] are equally justified in honouring alike the priests [[priest]] by whom the sacrifices [[sacrifice]] are offered, and the players by whom the dramas are acted, that they may not be open to the charge of doing an injury to all their gods, if the plays are pleasing to all of them, or (which were still worse) to their [[good]] gods, if the plays are relished only by them.

12. that the romans, by refusing to the poets the same licence in [[respect]] of [[men]] which they allowed them in the case of the gods, showed a more delicate sensitiveness regarding themselves than regarding the gods.

the romans, however, as scipio boasts in that same discussion, declined having their conduct and [[good]] name subjected to the assaults and slanders of the poets, and went so far as to make it a [[capital]] crime if any one should dare to compose such verses. this was a very honourable course to pursue, so far as they themselves were concerned, but in [[respect]] of the gods it was proud and irreligious: for they knew that the gods not only tolerated, but relished, being lashed by the injurious expressions of the poets, and yet they themselves would not suffer this same handling; and what their ritual prescribed as acceptable to the gods, their [[law]] prohibited as injurious to themselves. how then, scipio, do you [[praise]] the romans for refusing this licence to the poets, so that no citizen could be calumniated, while you [[know]] that the gods were not included under this protection? do you count your senate-house worthy of so much higher a regard than the capitol? is the one [[city]] of [[rome]] more valuable in your [[eyes]] than the whole [[heaven]] of gods, that you prohibit your poets from uttering any injurious words against a citizen, though they may with impunity cast what imputations they please upon the gods, without the interference of senator, censor, [[prince]], or pontiff? it was, forsooth, intolerable that plautus or nævius should attack publius and cneius scipio, insufferable that cæcilius[pg 62] should lampoon cato; but quite proper that your terence should encourage youthful [[lust]] by the wicked [[example]] of supreme jove.

13. that the romans should have understood that gods who [[desired]] to be worshipped in licentious entertainments were unworthy of [[divine]] [[honour]].

but scipio, were he alive, would possibly reply: "how could we attach a penalty to that which the gods themselves have consecrated? for the theatrical entertainments in which such things are said, and acted, and performed, were introduced into roman [[society]] by the gods, who ordered that they should be dedicated and exhibited in their [[honour]]." but was not this, then, the plainest proof that they were no true gods, nor in any [[respect]] worthy of receiving [[divine]] honours [[honour]] from the [[republic]]? suppose they had required that in their [[honour]] the [[citizens]] of [[rome]] should be held up to ridicule, every roman would have resented the hateful proposal. how then, i would ask, can they be esteemed worthy of [[worship]], when they propose that their own crimes be used as material for celebrating their praises [[praise]]? does not this artifice expose them, and prove that they are detestable devils [[devil]]? thus the romans, though they were [[superstitious]] enough to serve as gods those who made no secret of their [[desire]] to be worshipped in licentious plays, yet had sufficient regard to their hereditary [[dignity]] and [[virtue]], to prompt them to refuse to players any such rewards [[reward]] as the greeks [[greek]] accorded them. on this point we have this testimony of scipio, recorded in cicero: "they [the romans] considered comedy and all theatrical performances as disgraceful, and therefore not only debarred players from offices and honours [[honour]] open to ordinary [[citizens]], but also decreed that their names should be branded by the censor, and erased from the roll of their tribe." an excellent decree, and another testimony to the sagacity of [[rome]]; but i could [[wish]] their prudence had been more thoroughgoing and consistent. for when i hear that if any roman citizen chose the stage as his profession, he not only closed to himself every laudable [[career]], but even became an outcast from his own tribe, i cannot but exclaim: this is the true roman spirit, this is worthy of a [[state]] [[jealous]] of its [[reputation]]. but then some one interrupts my rapture, by inquiring with what consistency players are[pg 63] debarred from all honours [[honour]], while plays are counted among the honours [[honour]] due to the gods? for a long while the [[virtue]] of [[rome]] was uncontaminated by theatrical exhibitions;[99] and if they had been adopted for the sake of gratifying the taste of the [[citizens]], they would have been introduced hand in hand with the relaxation of manners. but the [[fact]] is, that it was the gods who demanded that they should be exhibited to gratify them. with what [[justice]], then, is the player excommunicated by whom [[god]] is worshipped? on what pretext can you at once adore him who exacts, and brand him who acts these plays? this, then, is the controversy in which the greeks [[greek]] and romans are engaged. the greeks [[greek]] [[think]] they justly [[honour]] players, because they [[worship]] the gods who demand plays: the romans, on the other hand, do not suffer an actor to disgrace by his name his own plebeian tribe, far less the senatorial order. and the whole of this discussion may be summed up in the following syllogism. the greeks [[greek]] give us the major premiss: if such gods are to be worshipped, then certainly such [[men]] may be honoured. the romans add the minor: but such [[men]] must by no means be honoured. the christians [[christian]] draw the conclusion: therefore such gods must by no means be worshipped.

14. that [[plato]], who excluded poets from a well-ordered [[city]], was [[better]] than these gods who [[desire]] to be honoured by theatrical plays.

we have still to inquire why the poets who write the plays, and who by the [[law]] of the twelve tables are prohibited from injuring the [[good]] name of the [[citizens]], are reckoned more estimable than the actors, though they so shamefully asperse the [[character]] of the gods? is it [[right]] that the actors of these poetical and god-dishonouring effusions be branded, while their authors are honoured? must we not here award the palm to a [[greek]], [[plato]], who, in framing his ideal [[republic]],[100] conceived that poets should be [[banished]] from the [[city]] as enemies [[enemy]] of the [[state]]? he could not brook that the gods be[pg 64] brought into disrepute, nor that the minds [[mind]] of the [[citizens]] be depraved and besotted, by the fictions of the poets. compare now [[human]] [[nature]] as you see it in [[plato]], expelling poets from the [[city]] that the [[citizens]] be uninjured, with the [[divine]] [[nature]] as you see it in these gods exacting plays in their own [[honour]]. [[plato]] strove, though unsuccessfully, to persuade the light-minded and lascivious greeks [[greek]] to abstain from so much as writing such plays; the gods used their [[authority]] to extort the acting of the same from the dignified and sober-minded romans. and not content with having them acted, they had them dedicated to themselves, consecrated to themselves, solemnly celebrated in their own [[honour]]. to which, then, would it be more becoming in a [[state]] to decree [[divine]] honours [[honour]],—to [[plato]], who prohibited these wicked and licentious plays, or to the demons who delighted in blinding [[men]] to the [[truth]] of what [[plato]] unsuccessfully sought to inculcate?

this philosopher, [[plato]], has been elevated by labeo to the rank of a demigod, and set thus upon a level with such as hercules and romulus. labeo ranks demigods higher than heroes, but both he counts among the deities. but i have no [[doubt]] that he thinks [[think]] this [[man]] whom he reckons a demigod worthy of greater [[respect]] not only than the heroes, but also than the gods themselves. the laws [[law]] of the romans and the speculations of [[plato]] have this resemblance, that the latter pronounces a wholesale condemnation of poetical fictions, while the former restrain the licence of satire, at least so far as [[men]] are the objects of it. [[plato]] will not suffer poets even to dwell in his [[city]]: the laws [[law]] of [[rome]] prohibit actors from being enrolled as [[citizens]]; and if they had not feared to offend the gods who had [[asked]] the services of the players, they would in all likelihood have [[banished]] them altogether. it is obvious, therefore, that the romans could not receive, nor reasonably expect to receive, laws [[law]] for the regulation of their conduct from their gods, since the laws [[law]] they themselves enacted far surpassed and put to shame the morality of the gods. the gods demand stage-plays in their own [[honour]]; the romans exclude the players from all civic honours [[honour]]:[101] the former commanded that they should be celebrated by the scenic representation[pg 65] of their own disgrace; the latter commanded that no poet should dare to blemish the [[reputation]] of any citizen. but that demigod [[plato]] resisted the [[lust]] of such gods as these, and showed the romans what their genius had left incomplete; for he absolutely excluded poets from his ideal [[state]], whether they composed fictions with no regard to [[truth]], or set the worst possible examples [[example]] before wretched [[men]] under the guise of [[divine]] actions. we for our part, indeed, reckon [[plato]] neither a [[god]] nor a demigod; we would not even compare him to any of god's holy angels, nor to the truth-speaking prophets [[prophet]], nor to any of the [[apostles]] or martyrs of [[christ]], nay, not to any faithful [[christian]] [[man]]. the [[reason]] of this [[opinion]] of ours we will, [[god]] prospering us, render in its own place. nevertheless, since they [[wish]] him to be considered a demigod, we [[think]] he certainly is more entitled to that rank, and is every way superior, if not to hercules and romulus (though no historian could ever narrate nor any poet sing of him that he had killed his [[brother]], or committed any crime), yet certainly to priapus, or a cynocephalus,[102] or the fever,[103]—divinities whom the romans have partly received from foreigners, and partly consecrated by home-grown rites. how, then, could gods such as these be expected to promulgate [[good]] and wholesome laws [[law]], either for the prevention of [[moral]] and social evils [[evil]], or for their eradication where they had already sprung up?—gods who used their influence even to sow and cherish profligacy, by appointing that deeds truly or falsely ascribed to them should be published to the [[people]] by means of theatrical exhibitions, and by thus gratuitously fanning the flame of [[human]] [[lust]] with the breath of a seemingly [[divine]] approbation. in [[vain]] does cicero, speaking of poets, exclaim against this [[state]] of things in these words: "when the plaudits and acclamation of the [[people]], who sit as infallible judges [[judge]], are won by the poets, what darkness benights the [[mind]], what fears [[fear]] invade, what [[passions]] inflame it!"[104]

[pg 66]

15. that it was vanity, not [[reason]], which created some of the roman gods.

but is it not manifest that vanity rather than [[reason]] regulated the [[choice]] of some of their false gods? this [[plato]], whom they reckon a demigod, and who used all his eloquence to preserve [[men]] from the most dangerous [[spiritual]] calamities, has yet not been counted worthy even of a little shrine; but romulus, because they can call him their own, they have esteemed more highly than many gods, though their secret doctrine can allow him the rank only of a demigod. to him they allotted a flamen, that is to say, a [[priest]] of a class so highly esteemed in their [[religion]] (distinguished, too, by their conical mitres), that for only three of their gods were flamens appointed—the flamen dialis for [[jupiter]], martialis for [[mars]], and quirinalis for romulus (for when the ardour of his fellow-citizens had given romulus a seat among the gods, they gave him this new name quirinus). and thus by this [[honour]] romulus has been preferred to [[neptune]] and pluto, jupiter's brothers [[brother]], and to saturn himself, their [[father]]. they have assigned the same priesthood to serve him as to serve jove; and in giving [[mars]] (the reputed [[father]] of romulus) the same [[honour]], is this not rather for romulus' sake than to [[honour]] [[mars]]?

16. that if the gods had really possessed any regard for [[righteousness]], the romans should have received [[good]] laws [[law]] from them, instead of having to borrow them from other nations.

moreover, if the romans had been able to receive a [[rule]] of [[life]] from their gods, they would not have borrowed solon's laws [[law]] from the athenians, as they did some years after [[rome]] was founded; and yet they did not keep them as they received them, but endeavoured to improve and amend them.[105] although lycurgus pretended that he was authorized by [[apollo]] to give laws [[law]] to the lacedemonians, the sensible romans did not choose to [[believe]] this, and were not induced to borrow laws [[law]] from sparta. numa pompilius, who succeeded[pg 67] romulus in the [[kingdom]], is said to have framed some laws [[law]], which, however, were not sufficient for the regulation of civic affairs. among these regulations were many pertaining to [[religious]] observances, and yet he is not reported to have received even these from the gods. with [[respect]], then, to [[moral]] evils [[evil]], evils [[evil]] of [[life]] and conduct,—evils which are so mighty, that, according to the wisest pagans,[106] by them states are ruined while their cities [[city]] stand uninjured,—their gods made not the smallest provision for preserving their worshippers from these evils [[evil]], but, on the contrary, took special pains [[pain]] to increase them, as we have previously endeavoured to prove.

17. of the rape of the sabine [[women]], and other iniquities perpetrated in rome's palmiest days.

but possibly we are to find the [[reason]] for this neglect of the romans by their gods, in the saying of sallust, that "equity and [[virtue]] prevailed among the romans not more by [[force]] of laws [[law]] than of [[nature]]."[107] i presume it is to this inborn equity and goodness of disposition we are to ascribe the rape of the sabine [[women]]. what, indeed, could be more equitable and [[virtuous]], than to carry off by [[force]], as each [[man]] was fit, and without their parents' [[consent]], girls who were strangers and guests, and who had been decoyed and entrapped by the pretence of a spectacle! if the sabines were [[wrong]] to deny their daughters [[daughter]] when the romans [[asked]] for them, was it not a greater [[wrong]] in the romans to carry them off after that denial? the romans might more justly have waged [[war]] against the neighbouring nation for having refused their daughters [[daughter]] in [[marriage]] when they first sought them, than for having demanded them back when they had stolen them. [[war]] should have been proclaimed at first: it was then that [[mars]] should have helped his warlike [[son]], that he might by [[force]] of arms avenge the injury done him by the refusal of [[marriage]], and might also thus [[win]] the [[women]] he [[desired]]. there might have been some appearance of "right of war" in a victor carrying off, in [[virtue]] of this [[right]], the virgins who[pg 68] had been without any show of [[right]] denied him; whereas there was no "right of peace" entitling him to carry off those who were not given to him, and to wage an [[unjust]] [[war]] with their justly enraged parents. one [[happy]] circumstance was indeed connected with this act of [[violence]], viz., that though it was commemorated by the games of the circus, yet even this did not constitute it a precedent in the [[city]] or realm of [[rome]]. if one would find [[fault]] with the results of this act, it must rather be on the ground that the romans made romulus a [[god]] in spite of his perpetrating this [[iniquity]]; for one cannot reproach them with making this deed any [[kind]] of precedent for the rape of [[women]].

again, i presume it was due to this [[natural]] equity and [[virtue]], that after the expulsion of [[king]] tarquin, whose [[son]] had violated lucretia, junius brutus the consul forced lucius tarquinius collatinus, lucretia's husband and his own colleague, a [[good]] and [[innocent]] [[man]], to resign his office and go into [[banishment]], on the one sole charge that he was of the name and [[blood]] of the tarquins. this [[injustice]] was perpetrated with the approval, or at least connivance, of the [[people]], who had themselves raised to the consular office both collatinus and brutus. another instance of this equity and [[virtue]] is found in their treatment of marcus camillus. this eminent [[man]], after he had rapidly conquered the veians, at that [[time]] the most formidable of rome's enemies [[enemy]], and who had maintained a ten years' [[war]], in which the roman [[army]] had [[suffered]] the usual calamities attendant on [[bad]] generalship, after he had restored security to [[rome]], which had begun to tremble for its safety, and after he had taken the wealthiest [[city]] of the [[enemy]], had charges brought against him by the malice of those that envied his [[success]], and by the insolence of the tribunes of the [[people]]; and seeing that the [[city]] bore him no gratitude for preserving it, and that he would certainly be condemned, he went into [[exile]], and even in his absence was fined 10,000 asses. shortly after, however, his ungrateful [[country]] had again to seek his protection from the gauls. but i cannot now mention all the shameful and iniquitous acts with which [[rome]] was agitated, when the [[aristocracy]] attempted to [[subject]] the [[people]], and the [[people]] resented their encroachments, and the advocates of either party[pg 69] were actuated rather by the [[love]] of [[victory]] than by any equitable or [[virtuous]] consideration.

18. what the [[history]] of sallust reveals regarding the [[life]] of the romans, either when straitened by [[anxiety]] or relaxed in security.

i will therefore pause, and adduce the testimony of sallust himself, whose words in [[praise]] of the romans (that "equity and [[virtue]] prevailed among them not more by [[force]] of laws [[law]] than of nature") have given [[occasion]] to this discussion. he was referring to that period immediately after the expulsion of the kings [[king]], in which the [[city]] became [[great]] in an incredibly short space of [[time]]. and yet this same writer acknowledges in the first [[book]] of his [[history]], in the very exordium of his [[work]], that even at that [[time]], when a very brief interval had elapsed after the [[government]] had passed from kings [[king]] to consuls, the more powerful [[men]] began to act unjustly, and occasioned the defection of the [[people]] from the patricians, and other disorders in the [[city]]. for after sallust had stated that the romans enjoyed greater harmony and a purer [[state]] of [[society]] between the second and third punic wars [[war]] than at any other [[time]], and that the cause of this was not their [[love]] of [[good]] order, but their [[fear]] lest the [[peace]] they had with [[carthage]] might be broken (this also, as we mentioned, nasica contemplated when he opposed the destruction of [[carthage]], for he supposed that [[fear]] would tend to repress wickedness, and to preserve wholesome ways of living), he then goes on to say: "yet, after the destruction of [[carthage]], discord, avarice, [[ambition]], and the other vices [[vice]] which are commonly generated by [[prosperity]], more than ever increased." if they "increased," and that "more than ever," then already they had appeared, and had been increasing. and so sallust adds this [[reason]] for what he said. "for," he says, "the oppressive measures of the powerful, and the consequent secessions of the plebs from the patricians, and other civil dissensions, had existed from the first, and affairs were administered with equity and well-tempered [[justice]] for no longer a period than the short [[time]] after the expulsion of the kings [[king]], while the [[city]] was occupied with the serious tuscan [[war]] and tarquin's vengeance." you see how, even in that brief period after the expulsion of the kings [[king]], [[fear]], he acknowledges, was the cause of the interval of[pg 70] equity and [[good]] order. they were afraid, in [[fact]], of the [[war]] which tarquin waged against them, after he had been driven from the [[throne]] and the [[city]], and had allied himself with the tuscans. but observe what he adds: "after that, the patricians treated the [[people]] as their slaves [[slave]], ordering them to be scourged or beheaded just as the kings [[king]] had done, driving them from their holdings, and harshly tyrannizing over those who had no [[property]] to lose. the [[people]], overwhelmed by these oppressive measures, and most of all by exorbitant usury, and obliged to contribute both [[money]] and personal service to the constant wars [[war]], at length took arms, and seceded to mount aventine and mount sacer, and thus obtained for themselves tribunes and protective laws [[law]]. but it was only the second punic [[war]] that put an end on both sides to discord and strife." you see what [[kind]] of [[men]] the romans were, even so early as a few years after the expulsion of the kings [[king]]; and it is of these [[men]] he says, that "equity and [[virtue]] prevailed among them not more by [[force]] of [[law]] than of [[nature]]."

now, if these were the days in which the roman [[republic]] shows fairest and [[best]], what are we to say or [[think]] of the succeeding [[age]], when, to use the words of the same historian, "changing little by little from the [[fair]] and [[virtuous]] [[city]] it was, it became utterly wicked and dissolute?" this was, as he mentions, after the destruction of [[carthage]]. sallust's brief sum and sketch of this period may be [[read]] in his own [[history]], in which he shows how the profligate manners which were propagated by [[prosperity]] resulted at [[last]] even in civil wars [[war]]. he says: "and from this [[time]] the primitive manners, instead of undergoing an insensible alteration as hitherto they had done, were swept away as by a torrent: the [[young]] [[men]] were so depraved by luxury and avarice, that it may justly be said that no [[father]] had a [[son]] who could either preserve his own patrimony, or keep his hands off other men's." sallust adds a number of particulars about the vices [[vice]] of sylla, and the debased condition of the [[republic]] in general; and other writers make similar observations, though in much less striking [[language]].

however, i suppose you now see, or at least any one who gives his attention has the means of seeing, in what a sink[pg 71] of [[iniquity]] that [[city]] was plunged before the advent of our heavenly [[king]]. for these things happened not only before [[christ]] had begun to [[teach]], but before he was even born of the virgin. if, then, they dare not impute to their gods the grievous evils [[evil]] of those former times [[time]], more tolerable before the destruction of [[carthage]], but intolerable and dreadful after it, although it was the gods who by their malign craft instilled into the minds [[mind]] of [[men]] the conceptions from which such dreadful vices [[vice]] branched out on all sides, why do they impute these [[present]] calamities to [[christ]], who teaches [[teach]] life-giving [[truth]], and forbids us to [[worship]] false and deceitful gods, and who, abominating and condemning with his [[divine]] [[authority]] those wicked and hurtful lusts of [[men]], gradually withdraws his own [[people]] from a [[world]] that is corrupted by these vices [[vice]], and is falling into ruins, to make of them an eternal [[city]], whose [[glory]] rests not on the acclamations of vanity, but on the [[judgment]] of [[truth]]?

19. of the [[corruption]] which had grown upon the roman [[republic]] before [[christ]] abolished the [[worship]] of the gods.

here, then, is this roman [[republic]], "which has changed little by little from the [[fair]] and [[virtuous]] [[city]] it was, and has become utterly wicked and dissolute." it is not i who am the first to say this, but their own authors, from whom we learned it for a fee, and who wrote it long before the coming of [[christ]]. you see how, before the coming of [[christ]], and after the destruction of [[carthage]], "the primitive manners, instead of undergoing insensible alteration, as hitherto they had done, were swept away as by a torrent; and how depraved by luxury and avarice the [[youth]] were." let them now, on their part, [[read]] to us any laws [[law]] given by their gods to the roman [[people]], and directed against luxury and avarice. and would that they had only been silent on the subjects [[subject]] of chastity and modesty, and had not demanded from the [[people]] indecent and shameful practices, to which they lent a pernicious patronage by their so-called divinity. let them [[read]] our commandments in the prophets [[prophet]], gospels, acts of the [[apostles]], or epistles; let them peruse the large number of precepts against avarice and luxury which are everywhere [[read]] to the congregations that meet for this [[purpose]], and[pg 72] which strike the ear, not with the uncertain sound of a philosophical discussion, but with the thunder of god's own oracle pealing from the clouds. and yet they do not impute to their gods the luxury and avarice, the cruel and dissolute manners, that had rendered the [[republic]] utterly wicked and [[corrupt]], even before the coming of [[christ]]; but whatever affliction their [[pride]] and effeminacy have exposed them to in these latter days, they furiously impute to our [[religion]]. if the kings [[king]] of the [[earth]] and all their subjects [[subject]], if all princes [[prince]] and judges [[judge]] of the [[earth]], if [[young]] [[men]] and maidens, old and [[young]], every [[age]], and both sexes [[sex]]; if they whom the baptist addressed, the publicans and the soldiers, were all together to hearken to and observe the precepts of the [[christian]] [[religion]] regarding a just and [[virtuous]] [[life]], then should the [[republic]] adorn the whole [[earth]] with its own felicity, and attain in [[life]] everlasting to the pinnacle of kingly [[glory]]. but because this [[man]] listens, and that [[man]] scoffs, and most are enamoured of the blandishments of [[vice]] rather than the wholesome severity of [[virtue]], the [[people]] of [[christ]], whatever be their condition—whether they be kings [[king]], princes [[prince]], judges [[judge]], soldiers, or provincials, [[rich]] or [[poor]], bond or [[free]], male or female—are enjoined to endure this earthly [[republic]], wicked and dissolute as it is, that so they may by this endurance [[win]] for themselves an eminent place in that most holy and august assembly of angels and [[republic]] of [[heaven]], in which the will of [[god]] is the [[law]].

20. of the [[kind]] of [[happiness]] and [[life]] truly delighted in by those who inveigh against the [[christian]] [[religion]].

but the worshippers and admirers of these gods delight in imitating their scandalous iniquities, and are nowise concerned that the [[republic]] be less depraved and licentious. only let it remain undefeated, they say, only let it flourish and abound in resources; let it be glorious by its victories [[victory]], or still [[better]], secure in [[peace]]; and what matters it to us? this is our concern, that every [[man]] be able to increase his [[wealth]] so as to supply his daily prodigalities, and so that the powerful may [[subject]] the [[weak]] for their own purposes [[purpose]]. let the [[poor]] court the [[rich]] for a living, and that under their protection they may enjoy a sluggish tranquillity; and let the[pg 73] [[rich]] [[abuse]] the [[poor]] as their dependants, to minister to their [[pride]]. let the [[people]] applaud not those who [[protect]] their interests, but those who provide them with [[pleasure]]. let no severe [[duty]] be commanded, no impurity forbidden. let kings [[king]] estimate their [[prosperity]], not by the [[righteousness]], but by the servility of their subjects [[subject]]. let the provinces stand [[loyal]] to the kings [[king]], not as [[moral]] guides, but as lords [[lord]] of their possessions and purveyors of their pleasures [[pleasure]]; not with a hearty reverence, but a crooked and servile [[fear]]. let the laws [[law]] take cognizance rather of the injury done to another man's [[man]] [[property]], than of that done to one's own [[person]]. if a [[man]] be a nuisance to his neighbour, or injure his [[property]], [[family]], or [[person]], let him be actionable; but in his own affairs let every one with impunity do what he will in company with his own [[family]], and with those who willingly join him. let there be a plentiful supply of [[public]] prostitutes for every one who wishes [[wish]] to use them, but specially for those who are too [[poor]] to keep one for their private use. let there be erected houses of the largest and most ornate description: in these let there be provided the most sumptuous banquets, where every one who pleases may, by day or night, play, drink, vomit,[108] dissipate. let there be everywhere heard the rustling of dancers, the loud, immodest laughter of the theatre; let a succession of the most cruel and the most voluptuous pleasures [[pleasure]] maintain a perpetual excitement. if such [[happiness]] is distasteful to any, let him be branded as a [[public]] [[enemy]]; and if any attempt to modify or put an end to it, let him be silenced, [[banished]], put an end to. let these be reckoned the true gods, who procure for the [[people]] this condition of things, and preserve it when once possessed. let them be worshipped as they [[wish]]; let them demand whatever games they please, from or with their own worshippers; only let them secure that such felicity be not imperilled by foe, plague, or disaster of any [[kind]]. what sane [[man]] would compare a [[republic]] such as this, i will not say to the roman [[empire]], but to the palace of sardanapalus, the ancient [[king]] who was so abandoned to pleasures [[pleasure]], that he caused it to be inscribed on his tomb, that now that he was[pg 74] [[dead]], he possessed only those things which he had swallowed and consumed by his appetites while alive? if these [[men]] had such a [[king]] as this, who, while self-indulgent, should lay no severe restraint on them, they would more enthusiastically consecrate to him a temple and a flamen than the ancient romans did to romulus.

21. cicero's [[opinion]] of the roman [[republic]].

but if our adversaries do not [[care]] how foully and disgracefully the roman [[republic]] be stained by [[corrupt]] practices, so long only as it holds together and continues in being, and if they therefore pooh-pooh the testimony of sallust to its "utterly wicked and profligate" condition, what will they make of cicero's statement, that even in his [[time]] it had become entirely extinct, and that there remained extant no roman [[republic]] at all? he introduces scipio (the scipio who had destroyed carthage) discussing the [[republic]], at a [[time]] when already there were presentiments of its speedy ruin by that [[corruption]] which sallust describes. in [[fact]], at the [[time]] when the discussion took place, one of the gracchi, who, according to sallust, was the first [[great]] instigator of seditions, had already been put to [[death]]. his [[death]], indeed, is mentioned in the same [[book]]. now scipio, in the end of the second [[book]], says: "as, among the different sounds which proceed from lyres, flutes, and the [[human]] voice, there must be maintained a [[certain]] harmony which a cultivated ear cannot endure to hear disturbed or jarring, but which may be elicited in full and absolute concord by the modulation even of voices very unlike one another; so, where [[reason]] is allowed to modulate the diverse elements of the [[state]], there is obtained a [[perfect]] concord from the upper, lower, and middle classes as from various sounds; and what musicians call harmony in singing, is concord in matters of [[state]], which is the strictest bond and [[best]] security of any [[republic]], and which by no ingenuity can be retained where [[justice]] has become extinct." then, when he had expatiated somewhat more fully, and had more copiously illustrated the benefits of its presence and the ruinous effects of its absence upon a [[state]], pilus, one of the company [[present]] at the discussion, struck in and demanded that the [[question]] should be more thoroughly sifted, and that[pg 75] the [[subject]] of [[justice]] should be freely discussed for the sake of ascertaining what [[truth]] there was in the [[maxim]] which was then becoming daily more current, that "the [[republic]] cannot be governed without [[injustice]]." scipio expressed his willingness to have this [[maxim]] discussed and sifted, and gave it as his [[opinion]] that it was baseless, and that no [[progress]] could be made in discussing the [[republic]] unless it was established, not only that this [[maxim]], that "the [[republic]] cannot be governed without [[injustice]]," was false, but also that the [[truth]] is, that it cannot be governed without the most absolute [[justice]]. and the discussion of this [[question]], being deferred till the next day, is carried on in the third [[book]] with [[great]] animation. for pilus himself undertook to defend the position that the [[republic]] cannot be governed without [[injustice]], at the same [[time]] being at special pains [[pain]] to clear himself of any real participation in that [[opinion]]. he advocated with [[great]] keenness the cause of [[injustice]] against [[justice]], and endeavoured by plausible reasons [[reason]] and examples [[example]] to demonstrate that the former is beneficial, the latter useless, to the [[republic]]. then, at the request of the company, lælius attempted to defend [[justice]], and strained every nerve to prove that nothing is so hurtful to a [[state]] as [[injustice]]; and that without [[justice]] a [[republic]] can neither be governed, nor even continue to [[exist]].

when this [[question]] has been handled to the satisfaction of the company, scipio reverts to the original thread of discourse, and repeats with commendation his own brief definition of a [[republic]], that it is the weal of the [[people]]. "the people" he defines as being not every assemblage or mob, but an assemblage associated by a [[common]] acknowledgment of [[law]], and by a [[community]] of interests. then he shows the use of definition in debate; and from these definitions of his own he gathers that a [[republic]], or "weal of the [[people]]," then exists only when it is well and justly governed, whether by a monarch, or an [[aristocracy]], or by the whole [[people]]. but when the monarch is [[unjust]], or, as the greeks [[greek]] say, a [[tyrant]]; or the aristocrats are [[unjust]], and form a faction; or the [[people]] themselves are [[unjust]], and become, as scipio for want of a [[better]] name calls them, themselves the [[tyrant]], then the [[republic]] is not only blemished (as had been proved the day[pg 76] before), but by legitimate deduction from those definitions, it altogether ceases to be. for it could not be the people's weal when a [[tyrant]] factiously lorded it over the [[state]]; neither would the [[people]] be any longer a [[people]] if it were [[unjust]], since it would no longer [[answer]] the definition of a people—"an assemblage associated by a [[common]] acknowledgment of [[law]], and by a [[community]] of interests."

when, therefore, the roman [[republic]] was such as sallust described it, it was not "utterly wicked and profligate," as he says, but had altogether ceased to [[exist]], if we are to admit the reasoning of that debate maintained on the [[subject]] of the [[republic]] by its [[best]] representatives. tully himself, too, speaking not in the [[person]] of scipio or any one else, but uttering his own sentiments, uses the following [[language]] in the beginning of the fifth [[book]], after quoting a line from the poet ennius, in which he said, "rome's severe morality and her [[citizens]] are her safeguard." "this verse," says cicero, "seems to me to have all the sententious truthfulness of an oracle. for neither would the [[citizens]] have availed without the morality of the [[community]], nor would the morality of the commons [[common]] without outstanding [[men]] have availed either to establish or so long to maintain in vigour so grand a [[republic]] with so wide and just an [[empire]]. accordingly, before our day, the hereditary usages formed our foremost [[men]], and they on their part retained the usages and [[institutions]] of their fathers [[father]]. but our [[age]], receiving the [[republic]] as a chef-d'œuvre of another [[age]] which has already begun to grow old, has not merely neglected to restore the colours of the original, but has not even been at the pains [[pain]] to preserve so much as the general outline and most outstanding features. for what survives of that primitive morality which the poet called rome's safeguard? it is so obsolete and forgotten, that, far from practising it, one does not even [[know]] it. and of the [[citizens]] what shall i say? morality has perished through [[poverty]] of [[great]] [[men]]; a [[poverty]] for which we must not only assign a [[reason]], but for the guilt of which we must [[answer]] as criminals [[criminal]] charged with a [[capital]] crime. for it is through our vices [[vice]], and not by any mishap, that we retain only the name of a [[republic]], and have long since lost the reality."

[pg 77]

this is the [[confession]] of cicero, long indeed after the [[death]] of africanus, whom he introduced as an interlocutor in his [[work]] de republica, but still before the coming of [[christ]]. yet, if the disasters he bewails had been lamented after the [[christian]] [[religion]] had been diffused, and had begun to prevail, is there a [[man]] of our adversaries who would not have [[thought]] that they were to be imputed to the christians [[christian]]? why, then, did their gods not take steps then to prevent the decay and extinction of that [[republic]], over the loss of which cicero, long before [[christ]] had come in the flesh, sings so lugubrious a dirge? its admirers have need to inquire whether, even in the days of primitive [[men]] and morals [[moral]], true [[justice]] flourished in it; or was it not perhaps even then, to use the casual expression of cicero, rather a coloured painting than the living reality? but, if [[god]] will, we shall consider this elsewhere. for i mean in its own place to show that—according to the definitions in which cicero himself, using scipio as his mouthpiece, briefly propounded what a [[republic]] is, and what a [[people]] is, and according to many testimonies, both of his own lips and of those who took part in that same debate—rome never was a [[republic]], because true [[justice]] had never a place in it. but accepting the more feasible definitions of a [[republic]], i grant there was a [[republic]] of a [[certain]] [[kind]], and certainly much [[better]] administered by the more ancient romans than by their [[modern]] representatives. but the [[fact]] is, true [[justice]] has no existence save in that [[republic]] whose founder and ruler is [[christ]], if at least any choose to call this a [[republic]]; and indeed we cannot deny that it is the people's weal. but if perchance this name, which has become familiar in other connections, be considered alien to our [[common]] parlance, we may at all events say that in this [[city]] is true [[justice]]; the [[city]] of which holy [[scripture]] says, "glorious things are said of thee, o [[city]] of [[god]]."

22. that the roman gods never took any steps to prevent the [[republic]] from being ruined by immorality.

but what is relevant to the [[present]] [[question]] is this, that however admirable our adversaries say the [[republic]] was or is, it is [[certain]] that by the testimony of their own most learned[pg 78] writers it had become, long before the coming of [[christ]], utterly wicked and dissolute, and indeed had no existence, but had been destroyed by profligacy. to prevent this, surely these guardian gods ought to have given precepts of morals [[moral]] and a [[rule]] of [[life]] to the [[people]] by whom they were worshipped in so many temples, with so [[great]] a variety of priests [[priest]] and sacrifices [[sacrifice]], with such numberless and diverse rites, so many festal solemnities, so many celebrations of magnificent games. but in all this the demons only looked after their own interest, and cared not at all how their worshippers lived, or rather were at pains [[pain]] to induce them to lead an abandoned [[life]], so long as they paid these tributes to their [[honour]], and regarded them with [[fear]]. if any one denies this, let him [[produce]], let him point to, let him [[read]] the laws [[law]] which the gods had given against sedition, and which the gracchi transgressed when they threw everything into confusion; or those marius, and cinna, and carbo broke when they involved their [[country]] in civil wars [[war]], most iniquitous and unjustifiable in their causes, cruelly conducted, and yet more cruelly terminated; or those which sylla scorned, whose [[life]], [[character]], and deeds, as described by sallust and other historians, are the abhorrence of all [[mankind]]. who will deny that at that [[time]] the [[republic]] had become extinct?

possibly they will be bold enough to suggest in defence of the gods, that they abandoned the [[city]] on account of the profligacy of the [[citizens]], according to the lines of [[virgil]]:

"gone from each fane, each [[sacred]] shrine, are those who made this realm [[divine]]."[109]
but, firstly, if it be so, then they cannot [[complain]] against the [[christian]] [[religion]], as if it were that which gave offence to the gods and caused them to abandon [[rome]], since the roman immorality had long ago driven from the altars of the [[city]] a cloud of little gods, like as many flies. and yet where was this host of divinities, when, long before the [[corruption]] of the primitive morality, [[rome]] was taken and burnt by the gauls? perhaps they were [[present]], but asleep? for at that [[time]] the whole [[city]] fell into the hands of the [[enemy]], with the [[single]] exception of the capitoline hill; and this too would have been[pg 79] taken, had not—the watchful geese aroused the sleeping gods! and this gave [[occasion]] to the festival of the goose, in which [[rome]] sank nearly to the superstition of the [[egyptians]], who [[worship]] beasts and birds. but of these adventitious evils [[evil]] which are inflicted by hostile armies [[army]] or by some disaster, and which attach rather to the [[body]] than the [[soul]], i am not meanwhile disputing. at [[present]] i speak of the decay of morality, which at first almost imperceptibly lost its brilliant hue, but afterwards was wholly obliterated, was swept away as by a torrent, and involved the [[republic]] in such disastrous ruin, that though the houses and walls remained standing, the leading writers do not scruple to say that the [[republic]] was destroyed. now, the departure of the gods "from each fane, each [[sacred]] shrine," and their abandonment of the [[city]] to destruction, was an act of [[justice]], if their laws [[law]] inculcating [[justice]] and a [[moral]] [[life]] had been held in contempt by that [[city]]. but what [[kind]] of gods were these, [[pray]], who declined to [[live]] with a [[people]] who worshipped them, and whose [[corrupt]] [[life]] they had done nothing to reform?

23. that the vicissitudes of this [[life]] are dependent not on the favour or hostility of demons, but on the will of the true [[god]].

but, further, is it not obvious that the gods have abetted the fulfilment of men's desires [[desire]], instead of authoritatively bridling them? for marius, a low-born and self-made [[man]], who ruthlessly provoked and conducted civil wars [[war]], was so effectually aided by them, that he was seven times [[time]] consul, and died full of years in his seventh consulship, escaping the hands of sylla, who immediately afterwards came into [[power]]. why, then, did they not also aid him, so as to restrain him from so many enormities? for if it is said that the gods had no hand in his [[success]], this is no trivial admission, that a [[man]] can attain the dearly coveted felicity of this [[life]] even though his own gods be not propitious; that [[men]] can be loaded with the gifts of [[fortune]] as marius was, can enjoy health, [[power]], [[wealth]], honours [[honour]], [[dignity]], length of days, though the gods be hostile to him; and that, on the other hand, [[men]] can be tormented as regulus was, with captivity, bondage, destitution, watchings, [[pain]], and cruel [[death]], though the gods be his [[friends]].[pg 80] to concede this is to make a compendious [[confession]] that the gods are useless, and their [[worship]] superfluous. if the gods have taught the [[people]] rather what goes clean counter to the virtues [[virtue]] of the [[soul]], and that integrity of [[life]] which meets a [[reward]] after [[death]]; if even in [[respect]] of temporal and transitory blessings they neither hurt those whom they hate nor [[profit]] whom they [[love]], why are they worshipped, why are they invoked with such eager homage? why do [[men]] murmur in difficult and [[sad]] emergencies, as if the gods had retired in anger? and why, on their account, is the [[christian]] [[religion]] injured by the most unworthy calumnies? if in temporal matters they have [[power]] either for [[good]] or for [[evil]], why did they stand by marius, the worst of rome's [[citizens]], and abandon regulus, the [[best]]? does this not prove themselves to be most [[unjust]] and wicked? and even if it be supposed that for this very [[reason]] they are the rather to be feared and worshipped, this is a mistake; for we do not [[read]] that regulus worshipped them less assiduously than marius. neither is it apparent that a wicked [[life]] is to be chosen, on the ground that the gods are supposed to have favoured marius more than regulus. for metellus, the most highly esteemed of all the romans, who had five sons [[son]] in the consulship, was prosperous even in this [[life]]; and catiline, the worst of [[men]], reduced to [[poverty]] and defeated in the [[war]] his own guilt had aroused, lived and perished miserably. real and secure felicity is the peculiar possession of those who [[worship]] that [[god]] by whom alone it can be conferred.

it is thus apparent, that when the [[republic]] was being destroyed by profligate manners, its gods did nothing to hinder its destruction by the direction or correction of its manners, but rather accelerated its destruction by increasing the demoralization and [[corruption]] that already existed. they need not pretend that their goodness was shocked by the [[iniquity]] of the [[city]], and that they withdrew in anger. for they were there, sure enough; they are detected, convicted: they were equally unable to break [[silence]] so as to guide others, and to keep [[silence]] so as to conceal themselves. i do not dwell on the [[fact]] that the inhabitants of minturnæ took [[pity]] on marius, and commended him to the goddess[pg 81] marica in her grove, that she might give him [[success]] in all things, and that from the abyss of despair in which he then lay he forthwith returned unhurt to [[rome]], and entered the [[city]] the ruthless leader of a ruthless [[army]]; and they who [[wish]] to [[know]] how bloody was his [[victory]], how unlike a citizen, and how much more relentlessly than any [[foreign]] foe he acted, let them [[read]] the histories [[history]]. but this, as i said, i do not dwell upon; nor do i attribute the bloody bliss of marius to, i [[know]] not what minturnian [[goddess]] [marica], but rather to the secret providence of [[god]], that the mouths of our adversaries might be shut, and that they who are not [[led]] by passion, but by prudent consideration of events, might be delivered from error. and even if the demons have any [[power]] in these matters, they have only that [[power]] which the secret decree of the almighty allots to them, in order that we may not set too [[great]] store by earthly [[prosperity]], seeing it is oftentimes vouchsafed even to wicked [[men]] like marius; and that we may not, on the other hand, regard it as an [[evil]], since we see that many [[good]] and pious worshippers of the one true [[god]] are, in spite of the demons, pre-eminently successful; and, finally, that we may not suppose that these unclean spirits are either to be propitiated or feared for the sake of earthly blessings or calamities: for as wicked [[men]] on [[earth]] cannot do all they would, so neither can these demons, but only in so far as they are permitted by the decree of him whose judgments [[judgment]] are fully comprehensible, justly reprehensible by none.

24. of the deeds of sylla, in which the demons boasted that he had their [[help]].

it is [[certain]] that sylla—whose [[rule]] was so cruel, that, in comparison with it, the preceding [[state]] of things which he came to avenge was regretted—when first he advanced towards [[rome]] to give [[battle]] to marius, found the auspices so favourable when he sacrificed, that, according to livy's account, the augur postumius expressed his willingness to lose his head if sylla did not, with the [[help]] of the gods, accomplish what he designed. the gods, you see, had not departed from "every fane and [[sacred]] shrine," since they were still predicting the issue of these affairs, and yet were taking no steps to [[correct]] sylla himself. their presages promised him [[great]] [[prosperity]], but[pg 82] no threatenings of theirs subdued his [[evil]] [[passions]]. and then, when he was in [[asia]] conducting the [[war]] against mithridates, a message from [[jupiter]] was delivered to him by lucius titius, to the effect that he would conquer mithridates; and so it came to pass. and afterwards, when he was meditating a return to [[rome]] for the [[purpose]] of avenging in the [[blood]] of the [[citizens]] injuries done to himself and his [[friends]], a second message from [[jupiter]] was delivered to him by a soldier of the sixth legion, to the effect that it was he who had predicted the [[victory]] over mithridates, and that now he promised to give him [[power]] to recover the [[republic]] from his enemies [[enemy]], though with [[great]] bloodshed. sylla at once inquired of the soldier what form had appeared to him; and, on his reply, recognised that it was the same as [[jupiter]] had formerly employed to convey to him the assurance regarding the [[victory]] over mithridates. how, then, can the gods be justified in this matter for the [[care]] they took to predict these shadowy successes, and for their negligence in correcting sylla, and restraining him from stirring up a civil [[war]] so lamentable and atrocious, that it not merely disfigured, but extinguished, the [[republic]]? the [[truth]] is, as i have often said, and as [[scripture]] informs us, and as the facts [[fact]] themselves sufficiently indicate, the demons are found to look after their own ends only, that they may be regarded and worshipped as gods, and that [[men]] may be induced to offer to them a [[worship]] which associates them with their crimes, and involves them in one [[common]] wickedness and [[judgment]] of [[god]].

afterwards, when sylla had come to tarentum, and had sacrificed there, he saw on the head of the victim's liver the likeness of a golden [[crown]]. thereupon the same soothsayer postumius interpreted this to signify a signal [[victory]], and ordered that he only should [[eat]] of the entrails. a little afterwards, the [[slave]] of a [[certain]] lucius pontius cried out, "i am bellona's messenger; the [[victory]] is yours, sylla!" then he added that the capitol should be burned. as soon as he had uttered this prediction he left the camp, but returned the following day more excited than ever, and shouted, "the capitol is fired!" and fired indeed it was. this it was easy for a demon both to foresee and quickly to announce. but observe,[pg 83] as relevant to our [[subject]], what [[kind]] of gods they are under whom these [[men]] [[desire]] to [[live]], who blaspheme the saviour that delivers the wills of the faithful from the dominion of devils [[devil]]. the [[man]] cried out in prophetic rapture, "the [[victory]] is yours, sylla!" and to certify that he spoke by a [[divine]] spirit, he predicted also an event which was shortly to happen, and which indeed did fall out, in a place from which he in whom this spirit was speaking was far distant. but he never cried, forbear thy villanies, sylla!—the villanies which were committed at [[rome]] by that victor to whom a golden [[crown]] on the calf's liver had been shown as the [[divine]] evidence of his [[victory]]. if such signs as this were customarily sent by just gods, and not by wicked demons, then certainly the entrails he consulted should rather have given sylla intimation of the cruel disasters that were to befall the [[city]] and himself. for that [[victory]] was not so conducive to his exaltation to [[power]], as it was fatal to his [[ambition]]; for by it he became so insatiable in his desires [[desire]], and was rendered so arrogant and reckless by [[prosperity]], that he may be said rather to have inflicted a [[moral]] destruction on himself than corporal destruction on his enemies [[enemy]]. but these truly woful and deplorable calamities the gods gave him no previous hint of, neither by entrails, augury, [[dream]], nor prediction. for they feared his amendment more than his defeat. yea, they took [[good]] [[care]] that this glorious conqueror of his own fellow-citizens should be conquered and [[led]] captive by his own infamous vices [[vice]], and should thus be the more submissive [[slave]] of the demons themselves.

25. how powerfully the [[evil]] spirits incite [[men]] to wicked actions, by giving them the quasi-divine [[authority]] of their [[example]].

now, who does not hereby comprehend,—unless he has preferred to imitate such gods rather than by [[divine]] grace to withdraw himself from their fellowship,—who does not see how eagerly these [[evil]] spirits strive by their [[example]] to lend, as it were, [[divine]] [[authority]] to crime? is not this proved by the [[fact]] that they were seen in a wide plain in campania rehearsing among themselves the [[battle]] which shortly after took place there with [[great]] bloodshed between the armies [[army]] of [[rome]]? for at first there were heard loud crashing noises, and afterwards[pg 84] many reported that they had seen for some days together two armies [[army]] engaged. and when this [[battle]] ceased, they found the ground all indented with just such footprints of [[men]] and horses as a [[great]] conflict would leave. if, then, the deities were veritably fighting with one another, the civil wars [[war]] of [[men]] are sufficiently justified; yet, by the way, let it be observed that such pugnacious gods must be very wicked or very wretched. if, however, it was but a sham-fight, what did they intend by this, but that the civil wars [[war]] of the romans should seem no wickedness, but an imitation of the gods? for already the civil wars [[war]] had begun; and before this, some lamentable battles [[battle]] and execrable massacres had occurred. already many had been moved by the story of the soldier, who, on stripping the spoils of his slain foe, recognised in the stripped corpse his own [[brother]], and, with deep curses on civil wars [[war]], slew himself there and then on his brother's [[body]]. to [[disguise]] the bitterness of such tragedies, and kindle increasing ardour in this monstrous warfare, these malign demons, who were reputed and worshipped as gods, fell upon this plan of revealing themselves in a [[state]] of civil [[war]], that no compunction for fellow-citizens might cause the romans to shrink from such battles [[battle]], but that the [[human]] criminality might be justified by the [[divine]] [[example]]. by a like craft, too, did these [[evil]] spirits command that scenic entertainments, of which i have already spoken, should be instituted and dedicated to them. and in these entertainments the poetical compositions and actions of the drama ascribed such iniquities to the gods, that every one might safely imitate them, whether he believed the gods had actually done such things, or, not believing this, yet perceived that they most eagerly [[desired]] to be represented as having done them. and that no one might suppose, that in representing the gods as fighting with one another, the poets had slandered them, and imputed to them unworthy actions, the gods themselves, to complete the deception, confirmed the compositions of the poets by exhibiting their own battles [[battle]] to the [[eyes]] of [[men]], not only through actions in the theatres, but in their own persons [[person]] on the actual field.

we have been forced to bring forward these facts [[fact]], because their authors have not scrupled to say and to write that the[pg 85] roman [[republic]] had already been ruined by the depraved [[moral]] habits of the [[citizens]], and had ceased to [[exist]] before the advent of our [[lord]] [[jesus]] [[christ]]. now this ruin they do not impute to their own gods, though they impute to our [[christ]] the evils [[evil]] of this [[life]], which cannot ruin [[good]] [[men]], be they alive or [[dead]]. and this they do, though our [[christ]] has issued so many precepts inculcating [[virtue]] and restraining [[vice]]; while their own gods have done nothing whatever to preserve that [[republic]] that served them, and to restrain it from ruin by such precepts, but have rather hastened its destruction, by corrupting its morality through their pestilent [[example]]. no one, i fancy, will now be bold enough to say that the [[republic]] was then ruined because of the departure of the gods "from each fane, each [[sacred]] shrine," as if they were the [[friends]] of [[virtue]], and were offended by the vices [[vice]] of [[men]]. no, there are too many presages from entrails, auguries, soothsayings, whereby they boastingly proclaimed themselves prescient of future events and controllers of the [[fortune]] of [[war]],—all which prove them to have been [[present]]. and had they been indeed absent, the romans would never in these civil wars [[war]] have been so far transported by their own [[passions]] as they were by the instigations of these gods.

26. that the demons gave in secret [[certain]] obscure instructions in morals [[moral]], while in [[public]] their own solemnities inculcated all wickedness.

seeing that this is so,—seeing that the filthy and cruel deeds, the disgraceful and [[criminal]] actions of the gods, whether real or feigned, were at their own request published, and were consecrated, and dedicated in their [[honour]] as [[sacred]] and stated solemnities; seeing they vowed vengeance on those who refused to exhibit them to the [[eyes]] of all, that they might be proposed as deeds worthy of imitation, why is it that these same demons, who, by taking [[pleasure]] in such obscenities, acknowledge themselves to be unclean spirits, and by delighting in their own villanies and iniquities, real or imaginary, and by requesting from the immodest, and extorting from the modest, the celebration of these licentious acts, proclaim themselves instigators to a [[criminal]] and lewd [[life]];—why, i ask, are they represented as giving some [[good]] [[moral]] precepts to a few of their own elect, initiated in the secrecy of their shrines? if[pg 86] it be so, this very thing only serves further to demonstrate the malicious craft of these pestilent spirits. for so [[great]] is the influence of probity and chastity, that all [[men]], or almost all [[men]], are moved by the [[praise]] of these virtues [[virtue]]; nor is any [[man]] so depraved by [[vice]], but he hath some feeling of [[honour]] left in him. so that, unless the [[devil]] sometimes transformed himself, as [[scripture]] says, into an angel of [[light]],[110] he could not compass his deceitful [[purpose]]. accordingly, in [[public]], a bold impurity fills the ear of the [[people]] with noisy clamour; in private, a feigned chastity speaks in scarce audible whispers to a few: an open stage is provided for shameful things, but on the praiseworthy the curtain falls: grace hides, disgrace flaunts: a wicked deed draws an overflowing house, a [[virtuous]] [[speech]] finds scarce a hearer, as though purity were to be blushed at, impurity boasted of. where else can such confusion reign, but in devils' temples? where, but in the haunts of deceit? for the secret precepts are given as a sop to the [[virtuous]], who are few in number; the wicked examples [[example]] are exhibited to encourage the vicious, who are countless.

where and when those initiated in the mysteries of cœlestis received any [[good]] instructions, we [[know]] not. what we do [[know]] is, that before her shrine, in which her image is set, and amidst a vast crowd gathering from all quarters, and standing closely packed together, we were intensely interested spectators of the games which were going on, and saw, as we pleased to turn the eye, on this side a grand display of harlots, on the other the virgin [[goddess]]: we saw this virgin worshipped with prayer and with obscene rites. there we saw no shamefaced mimes, no actress overburdened with modesty: all that the obscene rites demanded was fully complied with. we were plainly shown what was pleasing to the virgin deity, and the matron who witnessed the spectacle returned [[home]] from the temple a wiser woman. some, indeed, of the more prudent [[women]] turned their faces from the immodest movements of the players, and learned the art [[arts]] of wickedness by a furtive regard. for they were restrained, by the modest demeanour due to [[men]], from looking boldly at the immodest gestures; but much more were they restrained from condemning with chaste[pg 87] [[heart]] the [[sacred]] rites of her whom they adored. and yet this licentiousness—which, if practised in one's [[home]], could only be done there in secret—was practised as a [[public]] lesson in the temple; and if any modesty remained in [[men]], it was occupied in marvelling that wickedness which [[men]] could not unrestrainedly commit should be part of the [[religious]] teaching of the gods, and that to omit its exhibition should incur the anger of the gods. what spirit can that be, which by a hidden inspiration stirs men's [[corruption]], and goads them to adultery, and feeds on the full-fledged [[iniquity]], unless it be the same that finds [[pleasure]] in such [[religious]] ceremonies [[ceremony]], sets in the temples images of devils [[devil]], and loves [[love]] to see in play the images of vices [[vice]]; that whispers in secret some righteous sayings to [[deceive]] the few who are [[good]], and scatters in [[public]] invitations to profligacy, to gain possession of the millions who are wicked?

27. that the obscenities of those plays which the romans consecrated in order to propitiate their gods, contributed largely to the overthrow of [[public]] order.

cicero, a weighty [[man]], and a philosopher in his way, when about to be made edile, wished the [[citizens]] to understand[111] that, among the other duties [[duty]] of his magistracy, he must propitiate flora by the celebration of games. and these games are reckoned devout in proportion to their lewdness. in another place,[112] and when he was now consul, and the [[state]] in [[great]] peril, he says that games had been celebrated for ten days together, and that nothing had been omitted which could pacify the gods: as if it had not been more satisfactory to irritate the gods by temperance, than to pacify them by debauchery; and to provoke their hate by honest living, than soothe it by such unseemly grossness. for no matter how cruel was the ferocity of those [[men]] who were threatening the [[state]], and on whose account the gods were being propitiated: it could not have been more hurtful than the [[alliance]] of gods who were won with the foulest vices [[vice]]. to avert the danger which threatened men's bodies [[body]], the gods were conciliated in a [[fashion]] that drove [[virtue]] from their spirits; and the gods did not enrol themselves as defenders of the battlements against the besiegers, until they had first stormed and sacked the morality[pg 88] of the [[citizens]]. this propitiation of such divinities,—a propitiation so wanton, so impure, so immodest, so wicked, so filthy, whose actors the innate and praiseworthy [[virtue]] of the romans disabled from civic honours [[honour]], erased from their tribe, recognised as polluted and made infamous;—this propitiation, i say, so foul, so detestable, and alien from every [[religious]] feeling, these fabulous and ensnaring accounts of the [[criminal]] actions of the gods, these scandalous actions which they either shamefully and wickedly committed, or more shamefully and wickedly feigned, all this the whole [[city]] learned in [[public]] both by the words and gestures of the actors. they saw that the gods delighted in the commission of these things, and therefore believed that they wished them not only to be exhibited to them, but to be imitated by themselves. but as for that [[good]] and honest instruction which they speak of, it was given in such secrecy, and to so few (if indeed given at all), that they seemed rather to [[fear]] it might be divulged, than that it might not be practised.

28. that the [[christian]] [[religion]] is health-giving.

they, then, are but abandoned and ungrateful wretches, in deep and fast bondage to that malign spirit, who [[complain]] and murmur that [[men]] are rescued by the name of [[christ]] from the hellish thraldom of these unclean spirits, and from a participation in their [[punishment]], and are brought out of the night of pestilential ungodliness into the [[light]] of most healthful piety. only such [[men]] could murmur that the masses flock to the churches [[church]] and their chaste acts of [[worship]], where a seemly separation of the sexes [[sex]] is observed; where they learn how they may so spend this earthly [[life]], as to [[merit]] a blessed eternity hereafter; where holy [[scripture]] and instruction in [[righteousness]] are proclaimed from a raised platform in presence of all, that both they who do the word may hear to their salvation, and they who do it not may hear to [[judgment]]. and though some enter who scoff at such precepts, all their petulance is either quenched by a sudden [[change]], or is restrained through [[fear]] or shame. for no filthy and wicked action is there set forth to be gazed at or to be imitated; but either the precepts of the true [[god]] are recommended, his [[miracles]] narrated, his gifts praised, or his benefits implored.

[pg 89]

29. an exhortation to the romans to renounce paganism.

this, rather, is the [[religion]] worthy of your desires [[desire]], o admirable roman [[race]],—the progeny of your scævolas and scipios, of regulus, and of fabricius. this rather covet, this distinguish from that foul vanity and crafty malice of the devils [[devil]]. if there is in your [[nature]] any eminent [[virtue]], only by true piety is it purged and perfected, while by impiety it is wrecked and punished. choose now what you will pursue, that your [[praise]] may be not in yourself, but in the true [[god]], in whom is no error. for of popular [[glory]] you have had your share; but by the secret providence of [[god]], the true [[religion]] was not offered to your [[choice]]. awake, it is now day; as you have already awaked in the persons [[person]] of some in whose [[perfect]] [[virtue]] and sufferings for the true [[faith]] we [[glory]]: for they, contending on all sides with hostile powers [[power]], and conquering them all by bravely dying, have purchased for us this [[country]] of ours with their [[blood]]; to which [[country]] we invite you, and exhort you to add yourselves to the number of the [[citizens]] of this [[city]], which also has a sanctuary[113] of its own in the true remission of sins [[sin]]. do not listen to those degenerate sons [[son]] of thine who slander [[christ]] and christians [[christian]], and impute to them these disastrous times [[time]], though they [[desire]] times [[time]] in which they may enjoy rather impunity for their wickedness than a peaceful [[life]]. such has never been rome's [[ambition]] even in regard to her earthly [[country]]. lay hold now on the celestial [[country]], which is easily won, and in which you will reign truly and for ever. for there shalt thou find no vestal [[fire]], no capitoline stone, but the one true god

"no date, no goal will here ordain: but grant an endless, boundless reign."[114]
no longer, then, [[follow]] after false and deceitful gods; abjure them rather, and despise them, bursting forth into true [[liberty]]. gods they are not, but malignant spirits, to whom your eternal [[happiness]] will be a sore [[punishment]]. juno, from whom you deduce your origin according to the flesh, did not so bitterly grudge rome's citadels to the trojans, as these devils [[devil]] whom yet ye repute gods, grudge an everlasting seat to the [[race]] of [[mankind]]. and thou thyself hast in no wavering voice passed[pg 90] [[judgment]] on them, when thou didst pacify them with games, and yet didst account as infamous the [[men]] by whom the plays were acted. suffer us, then, to assert thy [[freedom]] against the unclean spirits who had imposed on thy neck the yoke of celebrating their own shame and filthiness. the actors of these [[divine]] crimes thou hast removed from offices of [[honour]]; supplicate the true [[god]], that he may remove from thee those gods who delight in their crimes,—a most disgraceful thing if the crimes are really theirs, and a most malicious invention if the crimes are feigned. well done, in that thou hast spontaneously [[banished]] from the number of your [[citizens]] all actors and players. awake more fully: the majesty of [[god]] cannot be propitiated by that which defiles the [[dignity]] of [[man]]. how, then, can you [[believe]] that gods who take [[pleasure]] in such lewd plays, belong to the number of the holy powers [[power]] of [[heaven]], when the [[men]] by whom these plays are acted are by yourselves refused admission into the number of roman [[citizens]] even of the lowest grade? incomparably more glorious than [[rome]], is that heavenly [[city]] in which for [[victory]] you have [[truth]]; for [[dignity]], holiness; for [[peace]], felicity; for [[life]], eternity. much less does it admit into its [[society]] such gods, if thou dost blush to admit into thine such [[men]]. wherefore, if thou wouldst attain to the blessed [[city]], shun the [[society]] of devils [[devil]]. they who are propitiated by deeds of shame, are unworthy of the [[worship]] of right-hearted [[men]]. let these, then, be obliterated from your [[worship]] by the cleansing of the [[christian]] [[religion]], as those [[men]] were blotted from your citizenship by the censor's mark.

but, so far as regards carnal benefits, which are the only blessings the wicked [[desire]] to enjoy, and carnal miseries, which alone they shrink from enduring, we will show in the following [[book]] that the demons have not the [[power]] they are supposed to have; and although they had it, we ought rather on that account to despise these blessings, than for the sake of them to [[worship]] those gods, and by worshipping them to miss the attainment of these blessings they grudge us. but that they have not even this [[power]] which is ascribed to them by those who [[worship]] them for the sake of temporal advantages, this, i say, i will prove in the following [[book]]; so let us here close the [[present]] argument.

[pg 91]

book third.

argument.

as in the foregoing [[book]] augustine has proved regarding [[moral]] and [[spiritual]] calamities, so in this [[book]] he proves regarding external and bodily disasters, that since the foundation of the [[city]] the romans have been continually [[subject]] to them; and that even when the false gods were worshipped without a rival, before the advent of [[christ]], they afforded no relief from such calamities.

1. of the ills which alone the wicked [[fear]], and which the [[world]] continually [[suffered]], even when the gods were worshipped.

of [[moral]] and [[spiritual]] evils [[evil]], which are above all others to be deprecated, i [[think]] enough has already been said to show that the false gods took no steps to prevent the [[people]] who worshipped them from being overwhelmed by such calamities, but rather aggravated the ruin. i see i must now speak of those evils [[evil]] which alone are dreaded by the heathen—famine, pestilence, [[war]], pillage, captivity, massacre, and the like calamities, already enumerated in the first [[book]]. for [[evil]] [[men]] account those things alone [[evil]] which do not make [[men]] [[evil]]; neither do they blush to [[praise]] [[good]] things, and yet to remain [[evil]] among the [[good]] things they [[praise]]. it grieves them more to own a [[bad]] house than a [[bad]] [[life]], as if it were man's [[man]] [[greatest]] [[good]] to have everything [[good]] but himself. but not even such evils [[evil]] as were alone dreaded by the heathen were warded off by their gods, even when they were most unrestrictedly worshipped. for in various times [[time]] and places before the advent of our redeemer, the [[human]] [[race]] was crushed with numberless and sometimes incredible calamities; and at that [[time]] what gods but those did the [[world]] [[worship]], if you except the one nation of the hebrews, and, beyond them, such individuals [[individual]] as the most secret and most just [[judgment]] of [[god]] counted worthy of [[divine]] grace?[115] but that i may[pg 92] not be prolix, i will be silent regarding the heavy calamities that have been [[suffered]] by any other nations, and will speak only of what happened to [[rome]] and the roman [[empire]], by which i mean [[rome]] properly so called, and those lands [[land]] which already, before the coming of [[christ]], had by [[alliance]] or [[conquest]] become, as it were, members of the [[body]] of the [[state]].

2. whether the gods, whom the greeks [[greek]] and romans worshipped in [[common]], were justified in permitting the destruction of ilium.

first, then, why was troy or ilium, the cradle of the roman [[people]] (for i must not overlook nor [[disguise]] what i touched upon in the first book[116]), conquered, taken, and destroyed by the greeks [[greek]], though it esteemed and worshipped the same gods as they? priam, some [[answer]], paid the penalty of the perjury of his [[father]] laomedon.[117] then it is true that laomedon hired [[apollo]] and [[neptune]] as his workmen. for the story goes that he promised them wages, and then broke his bargain. i wonder that famous diviner [[apollo]] toiled at so huge a [[work]], and never suspected laomedon was going to [[cheat]] him of his [[pay]]. and [[neptune]] too, his uncle, [[brother]] of [[jupiter]], [[king]] of the sea, it really was not seemly that he should be ignorant of what was to happen. for he is introduced by homer[118] (who lived and wrote before the building of rome) as predicting something [[great]] of the [[posterity]] of æneas, who in [[fact]] founded [[rome]]. and as [[homer]] says, [[neptune]] also rescued æneas in a cloud from the wrath of achilles, though (according to virgil[119])

"all his will was to [[destroy]] his own creation, perjured troy."

gods, then, so [[great]] as [[apollo]] and [[neptune]], in ignorance of the [[cheat]] that was to defraud them of their wages, built the walls of troy for nothing but thanks and thankless [[people]].[120] there may be some [[doubt]] whether it is not a worse crime to [[believe]] such persons [[person]] to be gods, than to [[cheat]] such gods. even [[homer]] himself did not give full credence to the story; for while he represents [[neptune]], indeed, as hostile to the trojans, he introduces [[apollo]] as their champion, though the story implies that both were offended by that fraud. if, therefore,[pg 93] they [[believe]] their fables, let them blush to [[worship]] such gods; if they discredit the fables, let no more be said of the "trojan perjury;" or let them explain how the gods hated trojan, but loved roman perjury. for how did the conspiracy of catiline, even in so large and [[corrupt]] a [[city]], find so abundant a supply of [[men]] whose hands and tongues found them a living by perjury and civic broils? what else but perjury corrupted the judgments [[judgment]] pronounced by so many of the senators? what else corrupted the people's votes and decisions of all causes tried before them? for it seems that the ancient practice of taking oaths has been preserved even in the midst of the [[greatest]] [[corruption]], not for the sake of restraining wickedness by [[religious]] [[fear]], but to complete the tale of crimes by adding that of perjury.

3. that the gods could not be offended by the adultery of [[paris]], this crime being so [[common]] among themselves.

there is no ground, then, for representing the gods (by whom, as they say, that [[empire]] stood, though they are proved to have been conquered by the greeks) as being enraged at the trojan perjury. neither, as others again plead in their defence, was it indignation at the adultery of [[paris]] that caused them to withdraw their protection from troy. for their habit is to be instigators and instructors in [[vice]], not its avengers. "the [[city]] of [[rome]]," says sallust, "was first built and inhabited, as i have heard, by the trojans, who, flying their [[country]], under the conduct of æneas, wandered about without making any settlement."[121] if, then, the gods were of [[opinion]] that the adultery of [[paris]] should be punished, it was chiefly the romans, or at least the romans also, who should have [[suffered]]; for the adultery was brought about by æneas' [[mother]]. but how could they hate in [[paris]] a crime which they made no objection to in their own sister [[venus]], who (not to mention any other instance) committed adultery with anchises, and so became the [[mother]] of æneas? is it because in the one case menelaus[122] was aggrieved, while in the other vulcan[123] connived at the crime? for the gods, i fancy, are so little [[jealous]] of their wives [[wife]], that they make no scruple of sharing them with [[men]]. but perhaps i may be[pg 94] suspected of turning the myths into ridicule, and not handling so weighty a [[subject]] with sufficient gravity. well, then, let us say that æneas is not the [[son]] of [[venus]]. i am willing to i admit it; but is romulus any more the [[son]] of [[mars]]? for why not the one as well as the other? or is it lawful for gods to have intercourse with [[women]], unlawful for [[men]] to have intercourse with goddesses [[goddess]]? a hard, or rather an incredible condition, that what was allowed to [[mars]] by the [[law]] of [[venus]], should not be allowed to [[venus]] herself by her own [[law]]. however, both cases have the [[authority]] of [[rome]]; for cæsar in [[modern]] times [[time]] believed no less that he was descended from [[venus]],[124] than the ancient romulus believed himself the [[son]] of [[mars]].

4. of varro's [[opinion]], that it is useful for [[men]] to feign themselves the offspring of the gods.

some one will say, but do you [[believe]] all this? not i indeed. for even varro, a very learned heathen, all but admits that these stories are false, though he does not boldly and confidently say so. but he maintains it is useful for states that brave [[men]] [[believe]], though falsely, that they are descended from the gods; for that thus the [[human]] spirit, cherishing the [[belief]] of its [[divine]] descent, will both more boldly venture into [[great]] enterprises, and will carry them out more energetically, and will therefore by its very confidence secure more abundant [[success]]. you see how wide a field is opened to falsehood by this [[opinion]] of varro's, which i have expressed as well as i could in my own words; and how comprehensible it is, that many of the religions [[religion]] and [[sacred]] legends should be feigned in a [[community]] in which it was judged profitable for the [[citizens]] that lies [[lie]] should be told even about the gods themselves.

5. that it is not credible that the gods should have punished the adultery of [[paris]], seeing they showed no indignation at the adultery of the [[mother]] of romulus.

but whether [[venus]] could bear æneas to a [[human]] [[father]] anchises, or [[mars]] beget romulus of the [[daughter]] of numitor,[pg 95] we leave as unsettled questions [[question]]. for our own scriptures [[scripture]] suggest the very similar [[question]], whether the fallen angels had [[sexual]] intercourse with the daughters [[daughter]] of [[men]], by which the [[earth]] was at that [[time]] filled with giants, that is, with enormously large and [[strong]] [[men]]. at [[present]], then, i will limit my discussion to this dilemma: if that which their books [[book]] relate about the [[mother]] of æneas and the [[father]] of romulus be true, how can the gods be displeased with [[men]] for adulteries which, when committed by themselves, excite no displeasure? if it is false, not even in this case can the gods be angry that [[men]] should really commit adulteries, which, even when falsely attributed to the gods, they delight in. moreover, if the adultery of [[mars]] be discredited, that [[venus]] also may be freed from the imputation, then the [[mother]] of romulus is left unshielded by the pretext of a [[divine]] seduction. for sylvia was a vestal priestess, and the gods ought to avenge this sacrilege on the romans with greater severity than paris' adultery on the trojans. for even the romans themselves in primitive times [[time]] used to go so far as to bury alive any vestal who was detected in adultery, while [[women]] unconsecrated, though they were punished, were never punished with [[death]] for that crime; and thus they more earnestly vindicated the purity of shrines they esteemed [[divine]], than of the [[human]] bed.

6. that the gods exacted no penalty for the fratricidal act of romulus.

i add another instance: if the sins [[sin]] of [[men]] so greatly incensed those divinities, that they abandoned troy to [[fire]] and [[sword]] to punish the crime of [[paris]], the murder of romulus' [[brother]] ought to have incensed them more against the romans than the cajoling of a [[greek]] husband moved them against the trojans: fratricide in a newly-born [[city]] should have provoked them more than adultery in a [[city]] already flourishing. it makes no difference to the [[question]] we now discuss, whether romulus ordered his [[brother]] to be slain, or slew him with his own hand; a crime this latter which many shamelessly deny, many through shame [[doubt]], many in [[grief]] [[disguise]]. and we shall not pause to examine and weigh the testimonies of historical writers on the [[subject]]. all agree that the [[brother]] of romulus was slain, not by enemies [[enemy]], not by strangers. if it[pg 96] was romulus who either commanded or perpetrated this crime; romulus was more truly the head of the romans than [[paris]] of the trojans; why then did he who carried off another man's [[man]] [[wife]] bring down the anger of the gods on the trojans, while he who took his brother's [[life]] obtained the guardianship of those same gods? if, on the other hand, that crime was not wrought either by the hand or will of romulus, then the whole [[city]] is chargeable with it, because it did not see to its [[punishment]], and thus committed, not fratricide, but parricide, which is worse. for both brothers [[brother]] were the founders of that [[city]], of which the one was by villany prevented from being a ruler. so far as i see, then, no [[evil]] can be ascribed to troy which warranted the gods in abandoning it to destruction, nor any [[good]] to [[rome]] which accounts for the gods visiting it with [[prosperity]]; unless the [[truth]] be, that they fled from troy because they were vanquished, and betook themselves to [[rome]] to practise their characteristic deceptions there. nevertheless they kept a footing for themselves in troy, that they might [[deceive]] future inhabitants who repeopled these lands [[land]]; while at [[rome]], by a wider exercise of their malignant [[arts]], they exulted in more abundant honours [[honour]].

7. of the destruction of ilium by fimbria, a lieutenant of marius.

and surely we may ask what [[wrong]] [[poor]] ilium had done, that, in the first heat of the civil wars [[war]] of [[rome]], it should suffer at the hand of fimbria, the veriest villain among marius' partisans, a more fierce and cruel destruction than the grecian sack.[125] for when the greeks [[greek]] took it many escaped, and many who did not escape were [[suffered]] to [[live]], though in captivity. but fimbria from the first gave orders that not a [[life]] should be spared, and burnt up together the [[city]] and all its inhabitants. thus was ilium requited, not by the greeks [[greek]], whom she had provoked by wrong-doing; but by the romans, who had been built out of her ruins; while the gods, adored alike of both sides, did simply nothing, or, to speak more correctly, could do nothing. is it then true, that at this [[time]] also, after troy had repaired the damage done by the grecian [[fire]], all the gods by whose [[help]] the [[kingdom]] stood, "forsook each fane, each [[sacred]] shrine?"

[pg 97]

but if so, i ask the [[reason]]; for in my [[judgment]], the conduct of the gods was as much to be reprobated as that of the townsmen to be applauded. for these closed their gates against fimbria, that they might preserve the [[city]] for sylla, and were therefore burnt and consumed by the enraged general. now, up to this [[time]], sylla's cause was the more worthy of the two; for till now he used arms to restore the [[republic]], and as yet his [[good]] intentions had met with no reverses. what [[better]] thing, then, could the trojans have done? what more honourable, what more faithful to [[rome]], or more worthy of her relationship, than to preserve their [[city]] for the [[better]] part of the romans, and to shut their gates against a parricide of his [[country]]? it is for the defenders of the gods to consider the ruin which this conduct brought on troy. the gods deserted an adulterous [[people]], and abandoned troy to the fires [[fire]] of the greeks [[greek]], that out of her ashes a chaster [[rome]] might arise. but why did they a second [[time]] abandon this same town, allied now to [[rome]], and not making [[war]] upon her [[noble]] [[daughter]], but preserving a most stedfast and pious fidelity to rome's most justifiable faction? why did they give her up to be destroyed, not by the [[greek]] heroes, but by the basest of the romans? or, if the gods did not favour sylla's cause, for which the unhappy trojans maintained their [[city]], why did they themselves predict and promise sylla such successes? must we call them flatterers of the fortunate, rather than helpers of the wretched? troy was not destroyed, then, because the gods deserted it. for the demons, always watchful to [[deceive]], did what they could. for, when all the statues were overthrown and burnt together with the town, livy tells us that only the image of minerva is said to have been found standing uninjured amidst the ruins of her temple; not that it might be said in their [[praise]], "the gods who made this realm [[divine]]," but that it might not be said in their defence, they are "gone from each fane, each [[sacred]] shrine:" for that marvel was permitted to them, not that they might be proved to be powerful, but that they might be convicted of being [[present]].

8. whether [[rome]] ought to have been entrusted to the trojan gods?

where, then, was the [[wisdom]] of entrusting [[rome]] to the[pg 98] trojan gods, who had demonstrated their weakness in the loss of troy? will some one say that, when fimbria stormed troy, the gods were already resident in [[rome]]? how, then, did the image of minerva remain standing? besides, if they were at [[rome]] when fimbria destroyed troy, perhaps they were at troy when [[rome]] itself was taken and set on [[fire]] by the gauls. but as they are very acute in hearing, and very swift in their movements, they came quickly at the cackling of the goose to defend at least the capitol, though to defend the rest of the [[city]] they were too long in being warned.

9. whether it is credible that the [[peace]] during the reign of numa was brought about by the gods.

it is also believed that it was by the [[help]] of the gods that the successor of romulus, numa pompilius, enjoyed [[peace]] during his entire reign, and shut the gates of janus, which are customarily kept open[126] during [[war]]. and it is supposed he was thus requited for appointing many [[religious]] observances among the romans. certainly that [[king]] would have commanded our congratulations for so rare a leisure, had he been [[wise]] enough to spend it on wholesome pursuits, and, subduing a pernicious curiosity, had sought out the true [[god]] with true piety. but as it was, the gods were not the authors of his leisure; but possibly they would have deceived him less had they found him busier. for the more disengaged they found him, the more they themselves occupied his attention. varro informs us of all his efforts, and of the [[arts]] he employed to associate these gods with himself and the [[city]]; and in its own place, if [[god]] will, i shall discuss these matters. meanwhile, as we are speaking of the benefits conferred by the gods, i readily admit that [[peace]] is a [[great]] benefit; but it is a benefit of the true [[god]], which, like the sun, the rain, and other supports of [[life]], is frequently conferred on the ungrateful and wicked. but if this [[great]] boon was conferred on [[rome]] and pompilius by their gods, why did they never afterwards grant it to the roman [[empire]] during even more meritorious periods? were the [[sacred]] rites more efficient at[pg 99] their first institution than during their subsequent celebration? but they had no existence in numa's [[time]], until he added them to the ritual; whereas afterwards they had already been celebrated and preserved, that benefit might arise from them. how, then, is it that those forty-three, or as others prefer it, thirty-nine years of numa's reign, were passed in unbroken [[peace]], and yet that afterwards, when the [[worship]] was established, and the gods themselves, who were invoked by it, were the recognised guardians and patrons of the [[city]], we can with difficulty find during the whole period, from the building of the [[city]] to the reign of augustus, one year—that, viz., which followed the close of the first punic war—in which, for a marvel, the romans were able to shut the gates of [[war]]?[127]

10. whether it was desirable that the roman [[empire]] should be increased by such a furious succession of wars [[war]], when it might have been quiet and safe by following in the peaceful ways of numa.

do they reply that the roman [[empire]] could never have been so widely extended, nor so glorious, save by constant and unintermitting wars [[war]]? a fit argument, truly! why must a [[kingdom]] be distracted in order to be [[great]]? in this little [[world]] of man's [[man]] [[body]], is it not [[better]] to have a moderate stature, and health with it, than to attain the huge dimensions of a giant by unnatural torments, and when you attain it to find no rest, but to be pained the more in proportion to the size of your members? what [[evil]] would have resulted, or rather what [[good]] would not have resulted, had those times [[time]] continued which sallust sketched, when he says, "at first the kings [[king]] (for that was the first title of [[empire]] in the world) were divided in their sentiments: part cultivated the [[mind]], others the [[body]]: at that [[time]] the [[life]] of [[men]] was [[led]] without covetousness; every one was sufficiently satisfied with his own!"[128] was it requisite, then, for rome's [[prosperity]], that the [[state]] of things which [[virgil]] reprobates should succeed:

"at length stole on a baser [[age]], and war's indomitable rage, and greedy [[lust]] of gain?"[129]
[pg 100]

but obviously the romans have a plausible defence for undertaking and carrying on such disastrous wars [[war]],—to wit, that the pressure of their enemies [[enemy]] forced them to resist, so that they were compelled to [[fight]], not by any greed of [[human]] applause, but by the necessity of protecting [[life]] and [[liberty]]. well, let that pass. here is sallust's account of the matter: "for when their [[state]], enriched with laws [[law]], [[institutions]], territory, seemed abundantly prosperous and sufficiently powerful, according to the ordinary [[law]] of [[human]] [[nature]], opulence gave birth to envy. accordingly, the neighbouring kings [[king]] and states took arms and assaulted them. a few allies lent assistance; the rest, struck with [[fear]], kept aloof from dangers. but the romans, watchful at [[home]] and in [[war]], were active, made preparations, encouraged one another, marched to meet their enemies [[enemy]],—protected by arms their [[liberty]], [[country]], parents. afterwards, when they had repelled the dangers by their bravery, they carried [[help]] to their allies and [[friends]], and procured alliances more by conferring than by receiving favours."[130] this was to build up rome's greatness by honourable means. but, in numa's reign, i would [[know]] whether the long [[peace]] was maintained in spite of the incursions of wicked neighbours, or if these incursions were discontinued that the [[peace]] might be maintained? for if even then [[rome]] was harassed by wars [[war]], and yet did not meet [[force]] with [[force]], the same means she then used to quiet her enemies [[enemy]] without conquering them in [[war]], or terrifying them with the onset of [[battle]], she might have used always, and have reigned in [[peace]] with the gates of janus shut. and if this was not in her [[power]], then [[rome]] enjoyed [[peace]] not at the will of her gods, but at the will of her neighbours round about, and only so long as they cared to provoke her with no [[war]], unless perhaps these pitiful gods will dare to sell to one [[man]] as their favour what lies [[lie]] not in their [[power]] to bestow, but in the will of another [[man]]. these demons, indeed, in so far as they are permitted, can terrify or incite the minds [[mind]] of wicked [[men]] by their own peculiar wickedness. but if they always had this [[power]], and if no action were taken against their efforts by a more secret and higher [[power]], they would be supreme to give [[peace]] or[pg 101] the victories [[victory]] of [[war]], which almost always fall out through some [[human]] emotion, and frequently in opposition to the will of the gods, as is proved not only by lying legends, which scarcely hint or signify any grain of [[truth]], but even by roman [[history]] itself.

11. of the statue of [[apollo]] at cumæ, whose tears are supposed to have portended disaster to the greeks [[greek]], whom the [[god]] was unable to succour.

and it is still this weakness of the gods which is confessed in the story of the cuman [[apollo]], who is said to have wept for four days during the [[war]] with the achæans and [[king]] aristonicus. and when the augurs were alarmed at the portent, and had determined to cast the statue into the sea, the old [[men]] of cumæ interposed, and related that a similar prodigy had occurred to the same image during the wars [[war]] against antiochus and against perseus, and that by a decree of the senate gifts had been presented to [[apollo]], because the event had proved favourable to the romans. then soothsayers were summoned who were supposed to have greater professional [[skill]], and they pronounced that the weeping of apollo's image was propitious to the romans, because cumæ was a [[greek]] colony, and that [[apollo]] was bewailing (and thereby presaging) the [[grief]] and calamity that was about to [[light]] upon his own [[land]] of greece, from which he had been brought. shortly afterwards it was reported that [[king]] aristonicus was defeated and made [[prisoner]],—a defeat certainly opposed to the will of [[apollo]]; and this he indicated by even shedding tears from his marble image. and this shows us that, though the verses of the poets are mythical, they are not altogether devoid of [[truth]], but describe the manners of the demons in a sufficiently fit style. for in [[virgil]] diana mourned for camilla,[131] and hercules wept for pallas doomed to [[die]].[132] this is perhaps the [[reason]] why numa pompilius, too, when, enjoying prolonged [[peace]], but without knowing or inquiring from whom he received it, he began in his leisure to consider to what gods he should entrust the safe keeping and conduct of [[rome]], and not dreaming that the true, almighty, and most high [[god]] cares [[care]] for earthly affairs, but recollecting only that the trojan gods which æneas had[pg 102] brought to [[italy]] had been able to preserve neither the trojan nor lavinian [[kingdom]] founded by æneas himself, concluded that he must provide other gods as guardians of fugitives and helpers of the [[weak]], and add them to those earlier divinities who had either come over to [[rome]] with romulus, or when alba was destroyed.

12. that the romans added a vast number of gods to those introduced by numa, and that their numbers helped them not at all.

but though pompilius introduced so ample a ritual, yet did not [[rome]] see fit to be content with it. for as yet [[jupiter]] himself had not his [[chief]] temple,—it being [[king]] tarquin who built the capitol. and æsculapius left epidaurus for [[rome]], that in this foremost [[city]] he might have a finer field for the exercise of his [[great]] medical [[skill]].[133] the [[mother]] of the gods, too, came i [[know]] not whence from pessinuns; it being unseemly that, while her [[son]] presided on the capitoline hill, she herself should [[lie]] hid in obscurity. but if she is the [[mother]] of all the gods, she not only followed some of her [[children]] to [[rome]], but left others to [[follow]] her. i wonder, indeed, if she were the [[mother]] of cynocephalus, who a long while afterwards came from [[egypt]]. whether also the [[goddess]] fever was her offspring, is a matter for her grandson æsculapius[134] to decide. but of whatever breed she be, the [[foreign]] gods will not presume, i trust, to call a [[goddess]] base-born who is a roman citizen. who can number the deities to whom the guardianship of [[rome]] was entrusted? indigenous and imported, both of [[heaven]], [[earth]], hell, seas, fountains, rivers; and, as varro says, gods [[certain]] and uncertain, male and female: for, as among animals, so among all kinds [[kind]] of gods are there these distinctions. [[rome]], then, enjoying the protection of such a cloud of deities, might surely have been preserved from some of those [[great]] and horrible calamities, of which i can mention but a few. for by the [[great]] smoke of her altars she summoned to her protection, as by a beacon-fire, a host of gods, for whom she appointed and maintained temples, altars, sacrifices [[sacrifice]], priests [[priest]], and thus offended the true and most high [[god]], to whom alone all this ceremonial is lawfully due. and, indeed, she was more prosperous when she[pg 103] had fewer gods; but the greater she became, the more gods she [[thought]] she should have, as the larger ship needs to be manned by a larger crew. i suppose she despaired of the smaller number, under whose protection she had spent comparatively [[happy]] days, being able to defend her greatness. for even under the kings [[king]] (with the exception of numa pompilius, of whom i have already spoken), how wicked a contentiousness must have existed to [[occasion]] the [[death]] of romulus' brother!

13. by what [[right]] or agreement the romans obtained their first wives [[wife]].

how is it that neither juno, who with her husband [[jupiter]] even then cherished

"rome's sons [[son]], the nation of the gown,"[135]
nor [[venus]] herself, could assist the [[children]] of the loved æneas to find wives [[wife]] by some [[right]] and equitable means? for the lack of this entailed upon the romans the lamentable necessity of stealing their wives [[wife]], and then waging [[war]] with their fathers-in-law; so that the wretched [[women]], before they had recovered from the [[wrong]] done them by their husbands, were dowried with the [[blood]] of their fathers [[father]]. "but the romans conquered their neighbours." yes; but with what wounds on both sides, and with what [[sad]] slaughter of relatives and neighbours! the [[war]] of cæsar and pompey was the contest of only one father-in-law with one son-in-law; and before it began, the [[daughter]] of cæsar, pompey's [[wife]], was already [[dead]]. but with how keen and just an accent of [[grief]] does lucan[136] exclaim: "i sing that worse than civil [[war]] waged in the plains of emathia, and in which the crime was justified by the victory!"

the romans, then, conquered that they might, with hands stained in the [[blood]] of their fathers-in-law, wrench the miserable girls from their embrace,—girls who dared not weep for their slain parents, for [[fear]] of offending their victorious husbands; and while yet the [[battle]] was raging, stood with their prayers on their lips, and knew not for whom to utter them. such nuptials were certainly prepared for the roman [[people]] not by [[venus]], but bellona; or possibly that[pg 104] infernal fury alecto had more [[liberty]] to injure them now that juno was aiding them, than when the prayers of that [[goddess]] had excited her against æneas. andromache in captivity was happier than these roman brides. for though she was a [[slave]], yet, after she had become the [[wife]] of pyrrhus, no more trojans fell by his hand; but the romans slew in [[battle]] the very fathers [[father]] of the brides they fondled. andromache, the victor's captive, could only mourn, not [[fear]], the [[death]] of her [[people]]. the sabine [[women]], related to [[men]] still combatants, feared the [[death]] of their fathers [[father]] when their husbands went out to [[battle]], and mourned their [[death]] as they returned, while neither their [[grief]] nor their [[fear]] could be freely expressed. for the victories [[victory]] of their husbands, involving the destruction of fellow-townsmen, relatives, brothers [[brother]], fathers [[father]], caused either pious agony or cruel exultation. moreover, as the [[fortune]] of [[war]] is capricious, some of them lost their husbands by the [[sword]] of their parents, while others lost husband and [[father]] together in mutual destruction. for the romans by no means escaped with impunity, but they were driven back within their walls, and defended themselves behind closed gates; and when the gates were opened by guile, and the [[enemy]] admitted into the town, the forum itself was the field of a hateful and fierce engagement of fathers-in-law and sons-in-law. the ravishers were indeed quite defeated, and, flying on all sides to their houses, sullied with new shame their original shameful and lamentable triumph. it was at this juncture that romulus, hoping no more from the valour of his [[citizens]], prayed [[jupiter]] that they might stand their ground; and from this [[occasion]] the [[god]] gained the name of stator. but not even thus would the mischief have been finished, had not the ravished [[women]] themselves flashed out with dishevelled hair, and cast themselves before their parents, and thus disarmed their just rage, not with the arms of [[victory]], but with the supplications of filial affection. then romulus, who could not brook his own [[brother]] as a colleague, was compelled to accept titus tatius, [[king]] of the sabines, as his partner on the [[throne]]. but how long would he who misliked the fellowship of his own twin-brother endure a stranger? so, tatius being slain, romulus remained sole [[king]], that he might be the[pg 105] greater [[god]]. see what rights [[right]] of [[marriage]] these were that fomented unnatural wars [[war]]. these were the roman leagues of kindred, relationship, [[alliance]], [[religion]]. this was the [[life]] of the [[city]] so abundantly protected by the gods. you see how many severe things might be said on this theme; but our [[purpose]] carries us [[past]] them, and requires our discourse for other matters.

14. of the wickedness of the [[war]] waged by the romans against the albans, and of the victories [[victory]] won by the [[lust]] of [[power]].

but what happened after numa's reign, and under the other kings [[king]], when the albans were provoked into [[war]], with [[sad]] results not to themselves alone, but also to the romans? the long [[peace]] of numa had become tedious; and with what endless slaughter and detriment of both states did the roman and alban armies [[army]] bring it to an end! for alba, which had been founded by ascanius, [[son]] of æneas, and which was more properly the [[mother]] of [[rome]] than troy herself, was provoked to [[battle]] by tullus hostilius, [[king]] of [[rome]], and in the conflict both inflicted and received such damage, that at length both parties wearied of the struggle. it was then devised that the [[war]] should be decided by the combat of three twin-brothers from each [[army]]: from the romans the three horatii stood forward, from the albans the three curiatii. two of the horatii were overcome and disposed of by the curiatii; but by the remaining horatius the three curiatii were slain. thus [[rome]] remained victorious, but with such a [[sacrifice]] that only one survivor returned to his [[home]]. whose was the loss on both sides? whose the [[grief]], but of the offspring of æneas, the descendants of ascanius, the progeny of [[venus]], the grandsons of [[jupiter]]? for this, too, was a "worse than civil" [[war]], in which the belligerent states were [[mother]] and [[daughter]]. and to this combat of the three twin-brothers there was added another atrocious and horrible catastrophe. for as the two nations had formerly been friendly (being related and neighbours), the sister of the horatii had been betrothed to one of the curiatii; and she, when she saw her [[brother]] wearing the spoils of her betrothed, burst into tears, and was slain by her own [[brother]] in his anger. to me, this one girl seems to have been more humane than the whole roman [[people]]. i cannot [[think]] her to blame for[pg 106] lamenting the [[man]] to whom already she had plighted her troth, or, as perhaps she was doing, for grieving that her [[brother]] should have slain him to whom he had promised his sister. for why do we [[praise]] the [[grief]] of æneas (in virgil[137]) over the [[enemy]] cut down even by his own hand? why did marcellus shed tears over the [[city]] of syracuse, when he recollected, just before he destroyed, its magnificence and meridian [[glory]], and [[thought]] upon the [[common]] lot of all things? i demand, in the name of [[humanity]], that if [[men]] are praised for tears shed over enemies [[enemy]] conquered by themselves, a [[weak]] girl should not be counted [[criminal]] for bewailing her lover slaughtered by the hand of her [[brother]]. while, then, that maiden was weeping for the [[death]] of her betrothed inflicted by her brother's hand, [[rome]] was rejoicing that such devastation had been wrought on her [[mother]] [[state]], and that she had purchased a [[victory]] with such an expenditure of the [[common]] [[blood]] of herself and the albans.

why allege to me the mere names and words of "glory" and "victory?" tear off the [[disguise]] of wild delusion, and look at the naked deeds: weigh them naked, [[judge]] them naked. let the charge be brought against alba, as troy was charged with adultery. there is no such charge, none like it found: the [[war]] was kindled only in order that there

"might sound in languid ears the cry of tullus and of [[victory]]."[138]
this [[vice]] of restless [[ambition]] was the sole motive to that social and parricidal [[war]],—a [[vice]] which sallust brands in passing; for when he has spoken with brief but hearty commendation of those primitive times [[time]] in which [[life]] was spent without covetousness, and every one was sufficiently satisfied with what he had, he goes on: "but after cyrus in [[asia]], and the lacedemonians and athenians in greece, began to subdue cities [[city]] and nations, and to account the [[lust]] of sovereignty a sufficient ground for [[war]], and to reckon that the [[greatest]] glory[pg 107] consisted in the [[greatest]] [[empire]];"[139] and so on, as i need not now quote. this [[lust]] of sovereignty disturbs and consumes the [[human]] [[race]] with frightful ills. by this [[lust]] [[rome]] was overcome when she triumphed over alba, and praising her own crime, called it [[glory]]. for, as our scriptures [[scripture]] say, "the wicked boasteth of his heart's [[desire]], and blesseth the covetous, whom the [[lord]] abhorreth."[140] away, then, with these deceitful masks, these deluding whitewashes, that things may be truthfully seen and scrutinized. let no [[man]] tell me that this and the other was a "great" [[man]], because he fought and conquered so and so. gladiators [[fight]] and conquer, and this barbarism has its meed of [[praise]]; but i [[think]] it were [[better]] to take the consequences of any sloth, than to seek the [[glory]] won by such arms. and if two gladiators entered the arena to [[fight]], one being [[father]], the other his [[son]], who would endure such a spectacle? who would not be revolted by it? how, then, could that be a glorious [[war]] which a daughter-state waged against its [[mother]]? or did it constitute a difference, that the battlefield was not an arena, and that the wide plains were filled with the carcases not of two gladiators, but of many of the flower of two nations; and that those contests were viewed not by the amphitheatre, but by the whole [[world]], and furnished a profane spectacle both to those alive at the [[time]], and to their [[posterity]], so long as the fame of it is handed down?

yet those gods, guardians of the roman [[empire]], and, as it were, theatric spectators of such contests as these, were not satisfied until the sister of the horatii was added by her brother's [[sword]] as a third victim from the roman side, so that [[rome]] herself, though she won the day, should have as many deaths [[death]] to mourn. afterwards, as a fruit of the [[victory]], alba was destroyed, though it was there the trojan gods had formed a third asylum after ilium had been sacked by the greeks [[greek]], and after they had left lavinium, where æneas had founded a [[kingdom]] in a [[land]] of [[banishment]]. but probably alba was destroyed because from it too the gods had migrated, in their usual [[fashion]], as [[virgil]] says:

"gone from each fane, each [[sacred]] shrine, are those who made this realm [[divine]]."[141]
[pg 108]

gone, indeed, and from now their third asylum, that [[rome]] might seem all the wiser in committing herself to them after they had deserted three other cities [[city]]. alba, whose [[king]] amulius had [[banished]] his [[brother]], displeased them; [[rome]], whose [[king]] romulus had slain his [[brother]], pleased them. but before alba was destroyed, its [[population]], they say, was amalgamated with the inhabitants of [[rome]], so that the two cities [[city]] were one. well, admitting it was so, yet the [[fact]] remains that the [[city]] of ascanius, the third retreat of the trojan gods, was destroyed by the daughter-city. besides, to effect this pitiful conglomerate of the war's leavings, much [[blood]] was spilt on both sides. and how shall i speak in detail of the same wars [[war]], so often renewed in subsequent reigns, though they seemed to have been finished by [[great]] victories [[victory]]; and of wars [[war]] that [[time]] after [[time]] were brought to an end by [[great]] slaughters, and which yet [[time]] after [[time]] were renewed by the [[posterity]] of those who had made [[peace]] and struck treaties? of this calamitous [[history]] we have no small proof, in the [[fact]] that no subsequent [[king]] closed the gates of [[war]]; and therefore, with all their tutelar gods, no one of them reigned in [[peace]].

15. what manner of [[life]] and [[death]] the roman kings [[king]] had.

and what was the end of the kings [[king]] themselves? of romulus, a flattering legend tells us that he was assumed into [[heaven]]. but [[certain]] roman historians relate that he was torn in pieces by the senate for his ferocity, and that a [[man]], julius proculus, was suborned to give out that romulus had appeared to him, and through him commanded the roman [[people]] to [[worship]] him as a [[god]]; and that in this way the [[people]], who were beginning to resent the action of the senate, were quieted and pacified. for an eclipse of the sun had also happened; and this was attributed to the [[divine]] [[power]] of romulus by the ignorant multitude, who did not [[know]] that it was brought about by the fixed laws [[law]] of the sun's course: though this [[grief]] of the sun might rather have been considered proof that romulus had been slain, and that the crime was indicated by this deprivation of the sun's [[light]]; as, in [[truth]], was the case when the [[lord]] was crucified through the[pg 109] [[cruelty]] and impiety of the [[jews]]. for it is sufficiently demonstrated that this latter obscuration of the sun did not occur by the [[natural]] laws [[law]] of the heavenly bodies [[body]], because it was then the jewish passover, which is held only at full moon, whereas [[natural]] eclipses of the sun happen only at the [[last]] quarter of the moon. cicero, too, shows plainly enough that the apotheosis of romulus was imaginary rather than real, when, even while he is praising him in one of scipio's remarks in the de republica, he says: "such a [[reputation]] had he acquired, that when he suddenly disappeared during an eclipse of the sun, he was supposed to have been assumed into the number of the gods, which could be supposed of no mortal who had not the highest [[reputation]] for [[virtue]]."[142] by these words, "he suddenly disappeared," we are to [[understand]] that he was mysteriously made away with by the [[violence]] either of the tempest or of a murderous assault. for their other writers speak not only of an eclipse, but of a sudden storm also, which certainly either afforded opportunity for the crime, or itself made an end of romulus. and of tullus hostilius, who was the third [[king]] of [[rome]], and who was himself destroyed by lightning, cicero in the same [[book]] says, that "he was not supposed to have been deified by this [[death]], possibly because the romans were unwilling to vulgarize the promotion they were assured or persuaded of in the case of romulus, lest they should bring it into contempt by gratuitously assigning it to all and sundry." in one of his invectives,[143] too, he says, in round terms, "the founder of this [[city]], romulus, we have raised to immortality and divinity by kindly celebrating his services;" implying that his deification was not real, but reputed, and called so by courtesy on account of his virtues [[virtue]]. in the dialogue hortensius, too, while speaking of the regular eclipses of the sun, he says that they "produce the same darkness as covered the [[death]] of romulus, which happened during an eclipse of the sun." here you see he does not at all shrink from speaking of his "death," for cicero was more of a reasoner than an eulogist.

the other kings [[king]] of [[rome]], too, with the exception of numa pompilius and ancus marcius, who died [[natural]] deaths [[death]], what[pg 110] horrible ends they had! tullus hostilius, the conqueror and destroyer of alba, was, as i said, himself and all his house consumed by lightning. priscus tarquinius was slain by his predecessor's sons [[son]]. servius tullius was foully murdered by his son-in-law tarquinius superbus, who succeeded him on the [[throne]]. nor did so flagrant a parricide committed against rome's [[best]] [[king]] drive from their altars and shrines those gods who were said to have been moved by paris' adultery to treat [[poor]] troy in this style, and abandon it to the [[fire]] and [[sword]] of the greeks [[greek]]. nay, the very tarquin who had murdered, was allowed to succeed his father-in-law. and this infamous parricide, during the reign he had secured by murder, was allowed to triumph in many victorious wars [[war]], and to build the capitol from their spoils; the gods meanwhile not departing, but abiding, and abetting, and suffering their [[king]] [[jupiter]] to preside and reign over them in that very splendid capitol, the [[work]] of a parricide. for he did not build the capitol in the days of his innocence, and then suffer [[banishment]] for subsequent crimes; but to that reign during which he built the capitol, he won his way by unnatural crime. and when he was afterwards [[banished]] by the romans, and forbidden the [[city]], it was not for his own but his son's wickedness in the affair of lucretia,—a crime perpetrated not only without his cognizance, but in his absence. for at that [[time]] he was besieging ardea, and fighting rome's battles [[battle]]; and we cannot say what he would have done had he been aware of his son's crime. notwithstanding, though his [[opinion]] was neither inquired into nor ascertained, the [[people]] stripped him of royalty; and when he returned to [[rome]] with his [[army]], it was admitted, but he was excluded, abandoned by his [[troops]], and the gates shut in his face. and yet, after he had appealed to the neighbouring states, and tormented the romans with calamitous but unsuccessful wars [[war]], and when he was deserted by the ally on whom he most depended, despairing of regaining the [[kingdom]], he lived a retired and quiet [[life]] for fourteen years, as it is reported, in tusculum, a roman town; where he grew old in his wife's company, and at [[last]] terminated his days in a much more desirable [[fashion]] than his father-in-law, who had perished by the hand of his son-in-law; his own daughter[pg 111] abetting, if report be true. and this tarquin the romans called, not the cruel, nor the infamous, but the proud; their own [[pride]] perhaps resenting his [[tyrannical]] airs. so little did they make of his murdering their [[best]] [[king]], his own father-in-law, that they elected him their own [[king]]. i wonder if it was not even more [[criminal]] in them to [[reward]] so bountifully so [[great]] a [[criminal]]. and yet there was no word of the gods abandoning the altars; unless, perhaps, some one will say in defence of the gods, that they remained at [[rome]] for the [[purpose]] of punishing the romans, rather than of aiding and profiting them, seducing them by empty victories [[victory]], and wearing them out by severe wars [[war]]. such was the [[life]] of the romans under the kings [[king]] during the much-praised epoch of the [[state]] which extends to the expulsion of tarquinius superbus in the 243d year, during which all those victories [[victory]], which were bought with so much [[blood]] and such disasters, hardly pushed rome's dominion twenty miles from the [[city]]; a territory which would by no means bear comparison with that of any petty gætulian [[state]].

16. of the first roman consuls, the one of whom drove the other from the [[country]], and shortly after perished at [[rome]] by the hand of a wounded [[enemy]], and so ended a [[career]] of unnatural murders.

to this epoch let us add also that of which sallust says, that it was ordered with [[justice]] and moderation, while the [[fear]] of tarquin and of a [[war]] with etruria was impending. for so long as the etrurians aided the efforts of tarquin to regain the [[throne]], [[rome]] was convulsed with distressing [[war]]. and therefore he says that the [[state]] was ordered with [[justice]] and moderation, through the pressure of [[fear]], not through the influence of equity. and in this very brief period, how calamitous a year was that in which consuls were first created, when the kingly [[power]] was abolished! they did not fulfil their term of office. for junius brutus deprived his colleague lucius tarquinius collatinus, and [[banished]] him from the [[city]]; and shortly after he himself fell in [[battle]], at once slaying and slain, having formerly put to [[death]] his own sons [[son]] and his brothers-in-law, because he had discovered that they were conspiring to restore tarquin. it is this deed that[pg 112] [[virgil]] shudders to record, even while he seems to [[praise]] it; for when he says,

"and call his own rebellious seed for menaced [[liberty]] to bleed,"

he immediately exclaims,

"unhappy father! howsoe'er the deed be judged by after days;"

that is to say, let [[posterity]] [[judge]] the deed as they please, let them [[praise]] and extol the [[father]] who slew his sons [[son]], he is unhappy. and then he adds, as if to console so unhappy a [[man]]:

"his country's [[love]] shall all o'erbear, and unextinguished thirst of [[praise]]."[144]
in the tragic end of brutus, who slew his own sons [[son]], and though he slew his [[enemy]], tarquin's [[son]], yet could not survive him, but was survived by tarquin the elder, does not the innocence of his colleague collatinus seem to be vindicated, who, though a [[good]] citizen, [[suffered]] the same [[punishment]] as tarquin himself, when that [[tyrant]] was [[banished]]? for brutus himself is said to have been a relative[145] of tarquin. but collatinus had the misfortune to bear not only the [[blood]], but the name of tarquin. to [[change]] his name, then, not his [[country]], would have been his fit penalty: to abridge his name by this word, and be called simply l. collatinus. but he was not compelled to lose what he could lose without detriment, but was stripped of the [[honour]] of the first consulship, and was [[banished]] from the [[land]] he loved. is this, then, the [[glory]] of brutus—this [[injustice]], alike detestable and profitless to the [[republic]]? was it to this he was driven by "his country's [[love]], and unextinguished thirst of [[praise]]?"

when tarquin the [[tyrant]] was expelled, l. tarquinius collatinus, the husband of lucretia, was created consul along with brutus. how justly the [[people]] acted, in looking more to the [[character]] than the name of a citizen! how unjustly brutus acted, in depriving of [[honour]] and [[country]] his colleague in that new office, whom he might have deprived of his name, if it were so offensive to him! such were the ills, such the disasters, which fell out when the [[government]] was "ordered[pg 113] with [[justice]] and moderation." lucretius, too, who succeeded brutus, was carried off by disease before the end of that same year. so p. valerius, who succeeded collatinus, and m. horatius, who filled the vacancy occasioned by the [[death]] of lucretius, completed that disastrous and funereal year, which had five consuls. such was the year in which the roman [[republic]] inaugurated the new [[honour]] and office of the consulship.

17. of the disasters which vexed the roman [[republic]] after the inauguration of the consulship, and of the non-intervention of the gods of [[rome]].

after this, when their fears [[fear]] were gradually diminished,—not because the wars [[war]] ceased, but because they were not so furious,—that period in which things were "ordered with [[justice]] and moderation" drew to an end, and there followed that [[state]] of matters which sallust thus briefly sketches: "then began the patricians to [[oppress]] the [[people]] as slaves [[slave]], to condemn them to [[death]] or scourging, as the kings [[king]] had done, to drive them from their holdings, and to tyrannize over those who had no [[property]] to lose. the [[people]], overwhelmed by these oppressive measures, and most of all by usury, and obliged to contribute both [[money]] and personal service to the constant wars [[war]], at length took arms and seceded to mount aventine and mount sacer, and thus secured for themselves tribunes and protective laws [[law]]. but it was only the second punic [[war]] that put an end on both sides to discord and strife."[146] but why should i spend [[time]] in writing such things, or make others spend it in reading them? let the terse summary of sallust suffice to intimate the misery of the [[republic]] through all that long period till the second punic [[war]],—how it was distracted from without by unceasing wars [[war]], and torn with civil broils and dissensions. so that those victories [[victory]] they boast were not the substantial joys of the [[happy]], but the empty comforts of wretched [[men]], and seductive incitements to turbulent [[men]] to concoct disasters upon disasters. and let not the [[good]] and prudent romans be angry at our saying this; and indeed we need neither deprecate nor denounce their anger, for we [[know]] they will harbour none. for we speak no more severely than their own authors, and much less elaborately and strikingly; yet they diligently[pg 114] [[read]] these authors, and compel their [[children]] to learn them. but they who are angry, what would they do to me were i to say what sallust says? "frequent mobs, seditions, and at [[last]] civil wars [[war]], became [[common]], while a few leading [[men]] on whom the masses were dependent, affected supreme [[power]] under the seemly pretence of seeking the [[good]] of senate and [[people]]; [[citizens]] were judged [[good]] or [[bad]], without reference to their loyalty to the [[republic]] (for all were equally corrupt); but the wealthy and dangerously powerful were esteemed [[good]] [[citizens]], because they maintained the existing [[state]] of things." now, if those historians judged that an honourable [[freedom]] of [[speech]] required that they should not be silent regarding the blemishes of their own [[state]], which they have in many places loudly applauded in their ignorance of that other and true [[city]] in which citizenship is an everlasting [[dignity]]; what does it become us to do, whose [[liberty]] ought to be so much greater, as our [[hope]] in [[god]] is [[better]] and more assured, when they impute to our [[christ]] the calamities of this [[age]], in order that [[men]] of the less instructed and weaker sort may be alienated from that [[city]] in which alone eternal and blessed [[life]] can be enjoyed? nor do we utter against their gods anything more horrible than their own authors do, whom they [[read]] and circulate. for, indeed, all that we have said we have derived from them, and there is much more to say of a worse [[kind]] which we are unable to say.

where, then, were those gods who are supposed to be justly worshipped for the slender and delusive [[prosperity]] of this [[world]], when the romans, who were seduced to their service by lying wiles, were harassed by such calamities? where were they when valerius the consul was killed while defending the capitol, that had been fired by exiles and slaves [[slave]]? he was himself [[better]] able to defend the temple of [[jupiter]], than that crowd of divinities with their most high and mighty [[king]], whose temple he came to the rescue of, were able to defend him. where were they when the [[city]], worn out with unceasing seditions, was waiting in some [[kind]] of calm for the return of the ambassadors who had been sent to [[athens]] to borrow laws [[law]], and was desolated by dreadful famine and pestilence? where were they when the [[people]], again distressed with[pg 115] famine, created for the first [[time]] a prefect of the market; and when spurius melius, who, as the famine increased, distributed corn to the famishing masses, was accused of aspiring to royalty, and at the instance of this same prefect, and on the [[authority]] of the superannuated dictator l. quintius, was put to [[death]] by quintus servilius, master of the horse,—an event which occasioned a serious and dangerous riot? where were they when that very severe pestilence visited [[rome]], on account of which the [[people]], after long and wearisome and useless supplications of the helpless gods, conceived the [[idea]] of celebrating lectisternia, which had never been done before; that is to say, they set couches in [[honour]] of the gods, which accounts for the name of this [[sacred]] rite, or rather sacrilege?[147] where were they when, during ten successive years of reverses, the roman [[army]] [[suffered]] frequent and [[great]] losses among the veians, and would have been destroyed but for the succour of furius camillus, who was afterwards [[banished]] by an ungrateful [[country]]? where were they when the gauls took, sacked, burned, and desolated [[rome]]? where were they when that memorable pestilence wrought such destruction, in which furius camillus too perished, who first defended the ungrateful [[republic]] from the veians, and afterwards saved it from the gauls? nay, during this plague they introduced a new pestilence of scenic entertainments, which spread its more fatal contagion, not to the bodies [[body]], but the morals [[moral]] of the romans? where were they when another frightful pestilence visited the city—i mean the poisonings imputed to an incredible number of [[noble]] roman matrons, whose characters [[character]] were infected with a disease more fatal than any plague? or when both consuls at the head of the [[army]] were beset by the samnites in the caudine forks, and forced to strike a shameful treaty, 600 roman knights being kept as hostages; while the [[troops]], having laid down their arms, and being stripped of everything, were made to pass under the yoke with one garment each? or when, in the midst of a serious pestilence, lightning struck the roman camp and killed many? or when [[rome]] was driven, by the [[violence]] of another intolerable plague, to send to epidaurus for æsculapius as a [[god]] of medicine; since the[pg 116] frequent adulteries of [[jupiter]] in his [[youth]] had not perhaps left this [[king]] of all who so long reigned in the capitol, any leisure for the study of medicine? or when, at one [[time]], the lucanians, brutians, samnites, tuscans, and senonian gauls conspired against [[rome]], and first slew her ambassadors, then overthrew an [[army]] under the prætor, putting to the [[sword]] 13,000 [[men]], besides the commander and seven tribunes? or when the [[people]], after the serious and long-continued disturbances at [[rome]], at [[last]] plundered the [[city]] and withdrew to janiculus; a danger so grave, that hortensius was created dictator,—an office which they had recourse to only in extreme emergencies; and he, having brought back the [[people]], died while yet he retained his office,—an event without precedent in the case of any dictator, and which was a shame to those gods who had now æsculapius among them?

at that [[time]], indeed, so many wars [[war]] were everywhere engaged in, that through scarcity of soldiers they enrolled for [[military]] service the proletarii, who received this name, because, being too [[poor]] to equip for [[military]] service, they had leisure to beget offspring.[148] pyrrhus, [[king]] of greece, and at that [[time]] of wide-spread renown, was invited by the tarentines to enlist himself against [[rome]]. it was to him that [[apollo]], when consulted regarding the issue of his enterprise, uttered with some pleasantry so ambiguous an oracle, that whichever alternative happened, the [[god]] himself should be counted [[divine]]. for he so worded the oracle,[149] that whether pyrrhus was conquered by the romans, or the romans by pyrrhus, the soothsaying [[god]] would securely await the issue. and then what frightful massacres of both armies [[army]] ensued! yet pyrrhus remained conqueror, and would have been able now to proclaim [[apollo]] a true diviner, as he understood the oracle, had not the romans been the conquerors in the next engagement. and while such disastrous wars [[war]] were being waged, a terrible disease broke out among the [[women]]. for the pregnant [[women]] died before delivery. and æsculapius, i fancy, excused himself in this matter on the ground that he professed to be arch-physician, not midwife. cattle, too, similarly perished;[pg 117] so that it was believed that the whole [[race]] of animals was destined to become extinct. then what shall i say of that memorable winter in which the weather was so incredibly severe, that in the forum frightfully deep snow lay for forty days together, and the tiber was frozen? had such things happened in our [[time]], what accusations we should have heard from our enemies! and that other [[great]] pestilence, which raged so long and carried off so many; what shall i say of it? spite of all the drugs of æsculapius, it only grew worse in its second year, till at [[last]] recourse was had to the sibylline books [[book]],—a [[kind]] of oracle which, as cicero says in his de divinatione, owes significance to its interpreters, who make doubtful conjectures as they can or as they [[wish]]. in this instance, the cause of the plague was said to be that so many temples had been used as private residences. and thus æsculapius for the [[present]] escaped the charge of either ignominious negligence or want of [[skill]]. but why were so many allowed to occupy [[sacred]] tenements without interference, unless because supplication had long been addressed in [[vain]] to such a crowd of gods, and so by degrees [[degree]] the [[sacred]] places were deserted of worshippers, and being thus vacant, could without offence be put at least to some [[human]] uses? and the temples, which were at that [[time]] laboriously recognised and restored that the plague might be stayed, fell afterwards into disuse, and were again devoted to the same [[human]] uses. had they not thus lapsed into obscurity, it could not have been pointed to as proof of varro's [[great]] erudition, that in his [[work]] on [[sacred]] places he cites so many that were unknown. meanwhile, the restoration of the temples procured no cure of the plague, but only a fine excuse for the gods.

18. the disasters [[suffered]] by the romans in the punic wars [[war]], which were not mitigated by the protection of the gods.

in the punic wars [[war]], again, when [[victory]] hung so long in the balance between the two kingdoms [[kingdom]], when two powerful nations were straining every nerve and using all their resources against one another, how many smaller kingdoms [[kingdom]] were crushed, how many large and flourishing cities [[city]] were demolished, how many states were overwhelmed and ruined, how many districts and lands [[land]] far and near were desolated! how[pg 118] often were the victors on either side vanquished! what multitudes of [[men]], both of those actually in arms and of others, were destroyed! what huge navies, too, were crippled in engagements, or were sunk by every [[kind]] of marine disaster! were we to attempt to recount or mention these calamities, we should become writers of [[history]]. at that period [[rome]] was mightily perturbed, and resorted to [[vain]] and ludicrous expedients. on the [[authority]] of the sibylline books [[book]], the secular games were re-appointed, which had been inaugurated a century before, but had faded into oblivion in happier times [[time]]. the games consecrated to the infernal gods were also renewed by the pontiffs; for they, too, had sunk into disuse in the [[better]] times [[time]]. and no wonder; for when they were renewed, the [[great]] abundance of dying [[men]] made all hell rejoice at its riches [[rich]], and give itself up to [[sport]]: for certainly the ferocious wars [[war]], and disastrous quarrels, and bloody victories—now on one side, and now on the other—though most calamitous to [[men]], afforded [[great]] [[sport]] and a [[rich]] banquet to the devils [[devil]]. but in the first punic [[war]] there was no more disastrous event than the roman defeat in which regulus was taken. we made mention of him in the two former books [[book]] as an incontestably [[great]] [[man]], who had before conquered and subdued the carthaginians, and who would have put an end to the first punic [[war]], had not an inordinate appetite for [[praise]] and [[glory]] prompted him to impose on the worn-out carthaginians harder conditions than they could bear. if the unlooked-for captivity and unseemly bondage of this [[man]], his fidelity to his oath, and his surpassingly cruel [[death]], do not bring a blush to the face of the gods, it is true that they are brazen and bloodless.

nor were there wanting at that [[time]] very heavy disasters within the [[city]] itself. for the tiber was extraordinarily flooded, and destroyed almost all the lower parts of the [[city]]; some buildings being carried away by the [[violence]] of the torrent, while others were soaked to rottenness by the water that stood round them even after the flood was gone. this visitation was followed by a [[fire]] which was still more destructive, for it consumed some of the loftier buildings round the forum, and spared not even its own proper temple, that of[pg 119] vesta, in which virgins chosen for this [[honour]], or rather for this [[punishment]], had been employed in conferring, as it were, everlasting [[life]] on [[fire]], by ceaselessly feeding it with fresh fuel. but at the [[time]] we speak of, the [[fire]] in the temple was not content with being kept alive: it raged. and when the virgins, scared by its vehemence, were unable to save those fatal images which had already brought destruction on three cities[150] in which they had been received, metellus the [[priest]], forgetful of his own safety, rushed in and rescued the [[sacred]] things, though he was half roasted in doing so. for either the [[fire]] did not recognise even him, or else the [[goddess]] of [[fire]] was there,—a [[goddess]] who would not have fled from the [[fire]] supposing she had been there. but here you see how a [[man]] could be of greater service to vesta than she could be to him. now if these gods could not avert the [[fire]] from themselves, what [[help]] against flames or flood could they bring to the [[state]] of which they were the reputed guardians? facts [[fact]] have shown that they were useless. these objections of ours would be idle if our adversaries maintained that their idols are consecrated rather as symbols of things eternal, than to secure the blessings of [[time]]; and that thus, though the symbols, like all material and visible things, might perish, no damage thereby resulted to the things for the sake of which they had been consecrated, while, as for the images themselves, they could be renewed again for the same purposes [[purpose]] they had formerly served. but with lamentable blindness, they suppose that, through the intervention of perishable gods, the earthly well-being and temporal [[prosperity]] of the [[state]] can be preserved from perishing. and so, when they are reminded that even when the gods remained among them this well-being and [[prosperity]] were blighted, they blush to [[change]] the [[opinion]] they are unable to defend.

19. of the calamity of the second punic [[war]], which consumed the [[strength]] of both parties.

as to the second punic [[war]], it were tedious to recount the disasters it brought on both the nations engaged in so protracted and shifting a [[war]], that (by the acknowledgment even of those writers who have made it their object not so much to narrate the wars [[war]] as to eulogize the dominion of rome) the[pg 120] [[people]] who remained victorious were less like conquerors than conquered. for, when hannibal poured out of [[spain]] over the pyrenees, and overran gaul, and burst through the alps, and during his whole course gathered [[strength]] by plundering and subduing as he went, and inundated [[italy]] like a torrent, how bloody were the wars [[war]], and how continuous the engagements, that were fought! how often were the romans vanquished! how many towns went over to the [[enemy]], and how many were taken and subdued! what fearful battles [[battle]] there were, and how often did the defeat of the romans shed lustre on the arms of hannibal! and what shall i say of the wonderfully crushing defeat at cannæ, where even hannibal, cruel as he was, was yet sated with the [[blood]] of his bitterest enemies [[enemy]], and gave orders that they be spared? from this field of [[battle]] he sent to [[carthage]] three bushels of gold rings, signifying that so much of the rank of [[rome]] had that day fallen, that it was easier to give an [[idea]] of it by measure than by numbers; and that the frightful slaughter of the [[common]] rank and file whose bodies [[body]] lay undistinguished by the ring, and who were numerous in proportion to their meanness, was rather to be conjectured than accurately reported. in [[fact]], such was the scarcity of soldiers after this, that the romans impressed their criminals [[criminal]] on the promise of impunity, and their slaves [[slave]] by the bribe of [[liberty]], and out of these infamous classes did not so much recruit as create an [[army]]. but these slaves [[slave]], or, to give them all their titles, these freedmen who were enlisted to do [[battle]] for the [[republic]] of [[rome]], lacked arms. and so they took arms from the temples, as if the romans were saying to their gods: lay down those arms you have held so long in [[vain]], if by [[chance]] our slaves [[slave]] may be able to use to [[purpose]] what you, our gods, have been impotent to use. at that [[time]], too, the [[public]] treasury was too low to [[pay]] the soldiers, and private resources were used for [[public]] purposes [[purpose]]; and so generously did individuals [[individual]] contribute of their [[property]], that, saving the gold ring and bulla which each wore, the pitiful mark of his rank, no senator, and much less any of the other orders and tribes, reserved any gold for his own use. but if in our day they were reduced to this [[poverty]], who would be able to endure their reproaches, barely endurable as they are now,[pg 121] when more [[money]] is spent on actors for the sake of a superfluous gratification, than was then disbursed to the legions?

20. of the destruction of the saguntines, who received no [[help]] from the roman gods, though perishing on account of their fidelity to [[rome]].

but among all the disasters of the second punic [[war]], there occurred none more lamentable, or calculated to excite deeper complaint, than the [[fate]] of the saguntines. this [[city]] of [[spain]], eminently friendly to [[rome]], was destroyed by its fidelity to the roman [[people]]. for when hannibal had broken treaty with the romans, he sought [[occasion]] for provoking them to [[war]], and accordingly made a fierce assault upon saguntum. when this was reported at [[rome]], ambassadors were sent to hannibal, urging him to raise the siege; and when this remonstrance was neglected, they proceeded to [[carthage]], lodged complaint against the breaking of the treaty, and returned to [[rome]] without accomplishing their object. meanwhile the siege went on; and in the eighth or ninth month, this opulent but ill-fated [[city]], dear as it was to its own [[state]] and to [[rome]], was taken, and subjected to treatment which one cannot [[read]], much less narrate, without [[horror]]. and yet, because it bears directly on the matter in hand, i will briefly touch upon it. first, then, famine wasted the saguntines, so that even [[human]] corpses were eaten by some: so at least it is recorded. subsequently, when thoroughly worn out, that they might at least escape the ignominy of falling into the hands of hannibal, they publicly erected a huge [[funeral]] pile, and cast themselves into its flames, while at the same [[time]] they slew their [[children]] and themselves with the [[sword]]. could these gods, these debauchees and gourmands, whose mouths water for fat sacrifices [[sacrifice]], and whose lips utter lying divinations,—could they not do anything in a case like this? could they not interfere for the preservation of a [[city]] closely allied to the roman [[people]], or prevent it perishing for its fidelity to that [[alliance]] of which they themselves had been the mediators? saguntum, faithfully keeping the treaty it had entered into before these gods, and to which it had firmly bound itself by an oath, was besieged, taken, and destroyed by a perjured [[person]]. if afterwards, when hannibal was close to the walls of [[rome]], it was the gods who terrified him with lightning and tempest, and drove him to a distance,[pg 122] why, i ask, did they not thus interfere before? for i make bold to say, that this demonstration with the tempest would have been more honourably made in defence of the allies of rome—who were in danger on account of their reluctance to break [[faith]] with the romans, and had no resources of their own—than in defence of the romans themselves, who were fighting in their own cause, and had abundant resources to oppose hannibal. if, then, they had been the guardians of roman [[prosperity]] and [[glory]], they would have preserved that [[glory]] from the stain of this saguntine disaster; and how silly it is to [[believe]] that [[rome]] was preserved from destruction at the hands of hannibal by the guardian [[care]] of those gods who were unable to rescue the [[city]] of saguntum from perishing through its fidelity to the [[alliance]] of [[rome]]. if the [[population]] of saguntum had been [[christian]], and had [[suffered]] as it did for the [[christian]] [[faith]] (though, of course, christians [[christian]] would not have used [[fire]] and [[sword]] against their own persons), they would have [[suffered]] with that [[hope]] which springs from [[faith]] in christ—the [[hope]] not of a brief temporal [[reward]], but of unending and eternal bliss. what, then, will the advocates and apologists of these gods say in their defence, when charged with the [[blood]] of these saguntines; for they are professedly worshipped and invoked for this very [[purpose]] of securing [[prosperity]] in this fleeting and transitory [[life]]? can anything be said but what was alleged in the case of regulus' [[death]]? for though there is a difference between the two cases, the one being an [[individual]], the other a whole [[community]], yet the cause of destruction was in both cases the keeping of their plighted troth. for it was this which made regulus willing to return to his enemies [[enemy]], and this which made the saguntines unwilling to revolt to their enemies [[enemy]]. does, then, the keeping of [[faith]] provoke the gods to anger? or is it possible that not only individuals [[individual]], but even entire communities [[community]], perish while the gods are propitious to them? let our adversaries choose which alternative they will. if, on the one hand, those gods are enraged at the keeping of [[faith]], let them enlist perjured persons [[person]] as their worshippers. if, on the other hand, [[men]] and states can suffer [[great]] and terrible calamities, and at [[last]] perish while favoured by the gods, then does their [[worship]] not produce[pg 123] [[happiness]] as its fruit. let those, therefore, who suppose that they have fallen into distress because their [[religious]] [[worship]] has been abolished, lay aside their anger; for it were quite possible that did the gods not only remain with them, but regard them with favour, they might yet be left to mourn an unhappy lot, or might, even like regulus and the saguntines, be horribly tormented, and at [[last]] perish miserably.

21. of the ingratitude of [[rome]] to scipio, its deliverer, and of its manners during the period which sallust describes as the [[best]].

omitting many things, that i may not exceed the limits of the [[work]] i have proposed to myself, i come to the epoch between the second and [[last]] punic wars [[war]], during which, according to sallust, the romans lived with the [[greatest]] [[virtue]] and concord. now, in this period of [[virtue]] and harmony, the [[great]] scipio, the liberator of [[rome]] and [[italy]], who had with surprising ability brought to a close the second punic war—that horrible, destructive, dangerous contest—who had defeated hannibal and subdued [[carthage]], and whose whole [[life]] is said to have been dedicated to the gods, and cherished in their temples,—this scipio, after such a triumph, was obliged to yield to the accusations of his enemies [[enemy]], and to leave his [[country]], which his valour had saved and liberated, to spend the remainder of his days in the town of liternum, so indifferent to a recall from [[exile]], that he is said to have given orders that not even his remains should [[lie]] in his ungrateful [[country]]. it was at that [[time]] also that the proconsul cn. manlius, after subduing the galatians, introduced into [[rome]] the luxury of [[asia]], more destructive than all hostile armies [[army]]. it was then that iron bedsteads and expensive carpets were first used; then, too, that female singers were admitted at banquets, and other licentious abominations were introduced. but at [[present]] i meant to speak, not of the evils [[evil]] [[men]] voluntarily practise, but of those they suffer in spite of themselves. so that the case of scipio, who succumbed to his enemies [[enemy]], and died in [[exile]] from the [[country]] he had rescued, was mentioned by me as being pertinent to the [[present]] discussion; for this was the [[reward]] he received from those roman gods whose temples he saved from hannibal, and who are worshipped only for the sake of securing temporal[pg 124] [[happiness]]. but since sallust, as we have seen, declares that the manners of [[rome]] were never [[better]] than at that [[time]], i therefore judged it [[right]] to mention the asiatic luxury then introduced, that it might be seen that what he says is true, only when that period is compared with the others, during which the morals [[moral]] were certainly worse, and the factions more [[violent]]. for at that time—i mean between the second and third punic war—that notorious lex voconia was passed, which prohibited a [[man]] from making a woman, even an only [[daughter]], his heir; than which [[law]] i am at a loss to conceive what could be more [[unjust]]. it is true that in the interval between these two punic wars [[war]] the misery of [[rome]] was somewhat less. abroad, indeed, their forces [[force]] were consumed by wars [[war]], yet also consoled by victories [[victory]]; while at [[home]] there were not such disturbances as at other times [[time]]. but when the [[last]] punic [[war]] had terminated in the utter destruction of rome's rival, which quickly succumbed to the other scipio, who thus earned for himself the surname of africanus, then the roman [[republic]] was overwhelmed with such a host of ills, which sprang from the [[corrupt]] manners induced by [[prosperity]] and security, that the sudden overthrow of [[carthage]] is seen to have injured [[rome]] more seriously than her long-continued hostility. during the whole subsequent period down to the [[time]] of cæsar augustus, who seems to have entirely deprived the romans of [[liberty]],—a [[liberty]], indeed, which in their own [[judgment]] was no longer glorious, but full of broils and dangers, and which now was quite enervated and languishing,—and who submitted all things again to the will of a monarch, and infused as it were a new [[life]] into the sickly old [[age]] of the [[republic]], and inaugurated a fresh régime;—during this whole period, i say, many [[military]] disasters were sustained on a variety of occasions [[occasion]], all of which i here pass by. there was specially the treaty of numantia, blotted as it was with extreme disgrace; for the [[sacred]] chickens, they say, flew out of the coop, and thus augured disaster to mancinus the consul; just as if, during all these years in which that little [[city]] of numantia had withstood the besieging [[army]] of [[rome]], and had become a terror to the [[republic]], the other generals had all marched against it under unfavourable auspices.

[pg 125]

22. of the edict of mithridates, commanding that all roman [[citizens]] found in [[asia]] should be slain.

these things, i say, i pass in [[silence]]; but i can by no means be silent regarding the order given by mithridates, [[king]] of [[asia]], that on one day all roman [[citizens]] residing anywhere in [[asia]] (where [[great]] numbers of them were following their private business) should be put to [[death]]: and this order was executed. how miserable a spectacle was then presented, when each [[man]] was suddenly and treacherously murdered wherever he happened to be, in the field or on the road, in the town, in his own [[home]], or in the street, in market or temple, in bed or at table! [[think]] of the groans of the dying, the tears of the spectators, and even of the executioners themselves. for how cruel a necessity was it that compelled the hosts of these victims, not only to see these abominable butcheries in their own houses, but even to perpetrate them: to [[change]] their countenance suddenly from the bland kindliness of [[friendship]], and in the midst of [[peace]] set about the [[business]] of [[war]]; and, shall i say, give and receive wounds, the slain being pierced in [[body]], the slayer in spirit! had all these murdered persons [[person]], then, despised auguries? had they neither [[public]] nor household gods to consult when they left their homes [[home]] and set out on that fatal [[journey]]? if they had not, our adversaries have no [[reason]] to [[complain]] of these [[christian]] times [[time]] in this particular, since long ago the romans despised auguries as idle. if, on the other hand, they did consult omens, let them tell us what [[good]] they got thereby, even when such things were not prohibited, but authorized, by [[human]], if not by [[divine]] [[law]].

23. of the internal disasters which vexed the roman [[republic]], and followed a portentous madness which seized all the domestic animals.

but let us now mention, as succinctly as possible, those disasters which were still more vexing, because nearer [[home]]; i mean those discords which are erroneously called civil, since they [[destroy]] civil interests. the seditions had now become urban wars [[war]], in which [[blood]] was freely shed, and in which parties raged against one another, not with wrangling and verbal contention, but with physical [[force]] and arms. what a sea of roman [[blood]] was shed, what desolations and devastations were[pg 126] occasioned in [[italy]] by wars [[war]] social, wars [[war]] servile, wars [[war]] civil! before the latins began the social [[war]] against [[rome]], all the animals used in the service of man—dogs, horses, asses, oxen, and all the rest that are [[subject]] to man—suddenly grew wild, and forgot their domesticated tameness, forsook their stalls and wandered at large, and could not be closely approached either by strangers or their own masters without danger. if this was a portent, how serious a calamity must have been portended by a plague which, whether portent or no, was in itself a serious calamity! had it happened in our day, the heathen would have been more rabid against us than their animals were against them.

24. of the civil dissension occasioned by the sedition of the gracchi.

the civil wars [[war]] originated in the seditions which the gracchi excited regarding the agrarian laws [[law]]; for they were minded to divide among the [[people]] the lands [[land]] which were wrongfully possessed by the nobility. but to reform an [[abuse]] of so long standing was an enterprise full of peril, or rather, as the event proved, of destruction. for what disasters accompanied the [[death]] of the elder gracchus! what slaughter ensued when, shortly after, the younger [[brother]] met the same fate! for [[noble]] and ignoble were indiscriminately massacred; and this not by legal [[authority]] and procedure, but by mobs and armed rioters. after the [[death]] of the younger gracchus, the consul lucius opimius, who had given [[battle]] to him within the [[city]], and had defeated and put to the [[sword]] both himself and his confederates, and had massacred many of the [[citizens]], instituted a judicial examination of others, and is reported to have put to [[death]] as many as 3000 [[men]]. from this it may be gathered how many fell in the riotous encounters, when the result even of a judicial investigation was so bloody. the assassin of gracchus himself sold his head to the consul for its weight in gold, such being the previous agreement. in this massacre, too, marcus fulvius, a [[man]] of consular rank, with all his [[children]], was put to [[death]].

25. of the temple of concord, which was erected by a decree of the senate on the scene of these seditions and massacres.

a pretty decree of the senate it was, truly, by which the temple of concord was built on the spot where that disastrous[pg 127] rising had taken place, and where so many [[citizens]] of every rank had fallen.[151] i suppose it was that the monument of the gracchi's [[punishment]] might strike the eye and affect the memory of the pleaders. but what was this but to deride the gods, by building a temple to that [[goddess]] who, had she been in the [[city]], would not have [[suffered]] herself to be torn by such dissensions? or was it that concord was chargeable with that bloodshed because she had deserted the minds [[mind]] of the [[citizens]], and was therefore incarcerated in that temple? for if they had any regard to consistency, why did they not rather erect on that site a temple of discord? or is there a [[reason]] for concord being a [[goddess]] while discord is none? does the distinction of labeo hold here, who would have made the one a [[good]], the other an [[evil]] deity?—a distinction which seems to have been suggested to him by the mere [[fact]] of his observing at [[rome]] a temple to fever as well as one to health. but, on the same ground, discord as well as concord ought to be deified. a hazardous venture the romans made in provoking so wicked a [[goddess]], and in forgetting that the destruction of troy had been occasioned by her taking offence. for, being indignant that she was not invited with the other gods [to the nuptials of peleus and thetis], she created dissension among the three goddesses [[goddess]] by sending in the golden apple, which occasioned strife in [[heaven]], [[victory]] to [[venus]], the rape of helen, and the destruction of troy. wherefore, if she was perhaps offended that the romans had not [[thought]] her worthy of a temple among the other gods in their [[city]], and therefore disturbed the [[state]] with such tumults, to how much fiercer passion would she be roused when she saw the temple of her adversary erected on the scene of that massacre, or, in other words, on the scene of her own handiwork! those [[wise]] and learned [[men]] are enraged at our laughing at these follies; and yet, being worshippers of [[good]] and [[bad]] divinities alike, they cannot escape this dilemma about concord and discord: either they have neglected the [[worship]] of these goddesses [[goddess]], and preferred fever and [[war]], to whom there are shrines erected of [[great]] antiquity, or they have worshipped[pg 128] them, and after all concord has abandoned them, and discord has tempestuously hurled them into civil wars [[war]].

26. of the various kinds [[kind]] of wars [[war]] which followed the building of the temple of concord.

but they supposed that, in erecting the temple of concord within the view of the orators, as a memorial of the [[punishment]] and [[death]] of the gracchi, they were raising an effectual obstacle to sedition. how much effect it had, is indicated by the still more deplorable wars [[war]] that followed. for after this the orators endeavoured not to avoid the [[example]] of the gracchi, but to surpass their projects; as did lucius saturninus, a tribune of the [[people]], and caius servilius the prætor, and some [[time]] after marcus drusus, all of whom stirred seditions which first of all occasioned bloodshed, and then the social wars [[war]] by which [[italy]] was grievously injured, and reduced to a piteously desolate and wasted condition. then followed the servile [[war]] and the civil wars [[war]]; and in them what battles [[battle]] were fought, and what [[blood]] was shed, so that almost all the peoples [[people]] of [[italy]], which formed the main [[strength]] of the roman [[empire]], were conquered as if they were barbarians! then even historians themselves find it difficult to explain how the servile [[war]] was begun by a very few, certainly less than seventy gladiators, what numbers of fierce and cruel [[men]] attached themselves to these, how many of the roman generals this band defeated, and how it laid waste many districts and cities [[city]]. and that was not the only servile [[war]]: the province of macedonia, and subsequently sicily and the sea-coast, were also depopulated by bands of slaves [[slave]]. and who can adequately describe either the horrible atrocities which the pirates first committed, or the wars [[war]] they afterwards maintained against [[rome]]?

27. of the civil [[war]] between marius and sylla.

but when marius, stained with the [[blood]] of his fellow-citizens, whom the rage of party had sacrificed, was in his turn vanquished and driven from the [[city]], it had scarcely [[time]] to breathe freely, when, to use the words of cicero, "cinna and marius together returned and took possession of it. then, indeed, the foremost [[men]] in the [[state]] were put to [[death]], its lights [[light]] quenched. sylla afterwards avenged this cruel [[victory]];[pg 129] but we need not say with what loss of [[life]], and with what ruin to the [[republic]]."[152] for of this vengeance, which was more destructive than if the crimes which it punished had been committed with impunity, lucan says: "the cure was excessive, and too closely resembled the disease. the guilty perished, but when none but the guilty survived: and then private [[hatred]] and anger, unbridled by [[law]], were allowed [[free]] indulgence."[153] in that [[war]] between marius and sylla, besides those who fell in the field of [[battle]], the [[city]], too, was filled with corpses in its streets, squares, markets, theatres, and temples; so that it is not easy to reckon whether the victors slew more before or after [[victory]], that they might be, or because they were, victors. as soon as marius triumphed, and returned from [[exile]], besides the butcheries everywhere perpetrated, the head of the consul octavius was exposed on the rostrum; cæsar and fimbria were assassinated in their own houses; the two crassi, [[father]] and [[son]], were murdered in one another's sight; bebius and numitorius were disembowelled by being dragged with hooks; catulus escaped the hands of his enemies [[enemy]] by drinking poison; merula, the flamen of [[jupiter]], cut his veins and made a libation of his own [[blood]] to his [[god]]. moreover, every one whose salutation marius did not [[answer]] by giving his hand, was at once cut down before his face.

28. of the [[victory]] of sylla, the avenger of the cruelties of marius.

then followed the [[victory]] of sylla, the so-called avenger of the cruelties of marius. but not only was his [[victory]] purchased with [[great]] bloodshed; but when hostilities were finished, hostility survived, and the subsequent [[peace]] was bloody as the [[war]]. to the former and still recent massacres of the elder marius, the younger marius and carbo, who belonged to the same party, added greater atrocities. for when sylla approached, and they despaired not only of [[victory]], but of [[life]] itself, they made a promiscuous massacre of [[friends]] and foes. and, not satisfied with staining every corner of [[rome]] with [[blood]], they besieged the senate, and [[led]] forth the senators to [[death]] from the curia as from a prison. mucius scævola the pontiff was slain at the altar of vesta, which he had clung to[pg 130] because no spot in [[rome]] was more [[sacred]] than her temple; and his [[blood]] well-nigh extinguished the [[fire]] which was kept alive by the constant [[care]] of the virgins. then sylla entered the [[city]] victorious, after having slaughtered in the villa publica, not by combat, but by an order, 7000 [[men]] who had surrendered, and were therefore unarmed; so fierce was the rage of [[peace]] itself, even after the rage of [[war]] was extinct. moreover, throughout the whole [[city]] every partisan of sylla slew whom he pleased, so that the number of deaths [[death]] went beyond computation, till it was suggested to sylla that he should allow some to survive, that the victors might not be destitute of subjects [[subject]]. then this furious and promiscuous licence to murder was checked, and much relief was expressed at the publication of the prescription list, containing though it did the death-warrant of two thousand [[men]] of the highest ranks, the senatorial and equestrian. the large number was indeed saddening, but it was consolatory that a limit was fixed; nor was the [[grief]] at the numbers slain so [[great]] as the joy that the rest were secure. but this very security, hard-hearted as it was, could not but bemoan the exquisite torture applied to some of those who had been doomed to [[die]]. for one was torn to pieces by the unarmed hands of the executioners; [[men]] treating a living [[man]] more savagely than wild beasts are used to tear an abandoned corpse. another had his [[eyes]] dug out, and his limbs cut away bit by bit, and was forced to [[live]] a long while, or rather to [[die]] a long while, in such torture. some celebrated cities [[city]] were put up to auction, like farms; and one was collectively condemned to slaughter, just as an [[individual]] [[criminal]] would be condemned to [[death]]. these things were done in [[peace]] when the [[war]] was over, not that [[victory]] might be more speedily obtained, but that, after being obtained, it might not be [[thought]] lightly of. [[peace]] vied with [[war]] in [[cruelty]], and surpassed it: for while [[war]] overthrew armed hosts, [[peace]] slew the defenceless. [[war]] gave [[liberty]] to him who was attacked, to strike if he could; [[peace]] granted to the survivors not [[life]], but an unresisting [[death]].

29. a comparison of the disasters which [[rome]] experienced during the gothic and gallic invasions, with those occasioned by the authors of the civil wars [[war]].

what fury of [[foreign]] nations, what barbarian ferocity, can[pg 131] compare with this [[victory]] of [[citizens]] over [[citizens]]? which was more disastrous, more hideous, more bitter to [[rome]]: the recent gothic and the old gallic [[invasion]], or the [[cruelty]] displayed by marius and sylla and their partisans against [[men]] who were members of the same [[body]] as themselves? the gauls, indeed, massacred all the senators they found in any part of the [[city]] except the capitol, which alone was defended; but they at least sold [[life]] to those who were in the capitol, though they might have starved them out if they could not have stormed it. the goths, again, spared so many senators, that it is the more surprising that they killed any. but sylla, while marius was still living, established himself as conqueror in the capitol, which the gauls had not violated, and thence issued his death-warrants; and when marius had escaped by flight, though destined to return more fierce and bloodthirsty than ever, sylla issued from the capitol even decrees of the senate for the slaughter and confiscation of the [[property]] of many [[citizens]]. then, when sylla left, what did the marian faction hold [[sacred]] or spare, when they gave no quarter even to mucius, a citizen, a senator, a pontiff, and though clasping in piteous embrace the very altar in which, they say, reside the destinies of [[rome]]? and that final proscription list of sylla's, not to mention countless other massacres, despatched more senators than the goths could even plunder.

30. of the connection of the wars [[war]] which with [[great]] severity and frequency followed one another before the advent of [[christ]].

with what effrontery, then, with what assurance, with what impudence, with what folly, or rather insanity, do they refuse to impute these disasters to their own gods, and impute the [[present]] to our christ! these bloody civil wars [[war]], more distressing, by the avowal of their own historians, than any [[foreign]] wars [[war]], and which were pronounced to be not merely calamitous, but absolutely ruinous to the [[republic]], began long before the coming of [[christ]], and gave birth to one another; so that a concatenation of unjustifiable causes [[led]] from the wars [[war]] of marius and sylla to those of sertorius and catiline, of whom the one was proscribed, the other brought up by sylla; from this to the [[war]] of lepidus and catulus, of whom the one wished to rescind, the other to defend the acts of sylla; from this to the [[war]] of[pg 132] pompey and cæsar, of whom pompey had been a partisan of sylla, whose [[power]] he equalled or even surpassed, while cæsar condemned pompey's [[power]] because it was not his own, and yet exceeded it when pompey was defeated and slain. from him the chain of civil wars [[war]] extended to the second cæsar, afterwards called augustus, and in whose reign [[christ]] was born. for even augustus himself waged many civil wars [[war]]; and in these wars [[war]] many of the foremost [[men]] perished, among them that skilful manipulator of the [[republic]], cicero. caius [julius] cæsar, when he had conquered pompey, though he used his [[victory]] with clemency, and granted to [[men]] of the opposite faction both [[life]] and honours [[honour]], was suspected of aiming at royalty, and was assassinated in the curia by a party of [[noble]] senators, who had conspired to defend the [[liberty]] of the [[republic]]. his [[power]] was then coveted by antony, a [[man]] of very different [[character]], polluted and debased by every [[kind]] of [[vice]], who was strenuously resisted by cicero on the same plea of defending the [[liberty]] of the [[republic]]. at this juncture that other cæsar, the adopted [[son]] of caius, and afterwards, as i said, known by the name of augustus, had made his début as a [[young]] [[man]] of remarkable genius. this youthful cæsar was favoured by cicero, in order that his influence might counteract that of antony; for he hoped that cæsar would overthrow and blast the [[power]] of antony, and establish a [[free]] [[state]],—so blind and unaware of the future was he: for that very [[young]] [[man]], whose advancement and influence he was fostering, allowed cicero to be killed as the seal of an [[alliance]] with antony, and subjected to his own [[rule]] the very [[liberty]] of the [[republic]] in defence of which he had made so many orations.

31. that it is effrontery to impute the [[present]] troubles to [[christ]] and the prohibition of polytheistic [[worship]], since even when the gods were worshipped such calamities befell the [[people]].

let those who have no gratitude to [[christ]] for his [[great]] benefits, blame their own gods for these heavy disasters. for certainly when these occurred the altars of the gods were kept blazing, and there rose the mingled fragrance of "sabæan incense and fresh garlands;"[154] the priests [[priest]] were clothed with [[honour]], the shrines were maintained in splendour; sacrifices [[sacrifice]],[pg 133] games, [[sacred]] ecstasies, were [[common]] in the temples; while the [[blood]] of the [[citizens]] was being so freely shed, not only in remote places, but among the very altars of the gods. cicero did not choose to seek sanctuary in a temple, because mucius had sought it there in [[vain]]. but they who most unpardonably calumniate this [[christian]] era, are the very [[men]] who either themselves fled for asylum to the places specially dedicated to [[christ]], or were [[led]] there by the barbarians that they might be safe. in short, not to recapitulate the many instances i have cited, and not to add to their number others which it were tedious to enumerate, this one thing i am persuaded of, and this every [[impartial]] [[judgment]] will readily acknowledge, that if the [[human]] [[race]] had received [[christianity]] before the punic wars [[war]], and if the same desolating calamities which these wars [[war]] brought upon [[europe]] and [[africa]] had followed the introduction of [[christianity]], there is no one of those who now accuse us who would not have attributed them to our [[religion]]. how intolerable would their accusations have been, at least so far as the romans are concerned, if the [[christian]] [[religion]] had been received and diffused prior to the [[invasion]] of the gauls, or to the ruinous floods and fires [[fire]] which desolated [[rome]], or to those most calamitous of all events, the civil wars! and those other disasters, which were of so [[strange]] a [[nature]] that they were reckoned prodigies, had they happened since the [[christian]] era, to whom but to the christians [[christian]] would they have imputed these as crimes? i do not speak of those things which were rather surprising than hurtful,—oxen speaking, unborn infants articulating some words in their mothers' wombs, serpents flying, hens and [[women]] being changed into the other [[sex]]; and other similar prodigies which, whether true or false, are recorded not in their imaginative, but in their historical works [[work]], and which do not injure, but only astonish [[men]]. but when it rained [[earth]], when it rained chalk, when it rained stones—not hailstones, but real stones—this certainly was calculated to do serious damage. we have [[read]] in their books [[book]] that the fires [[fire]] of etna, pouring down from the top of the mountain to the neighbouring shore, caused the sea to boil, so that rocks were burnt up, and the pitch of ships began to run,—a phenomenon incredibly surprising, but at the same [[time]] no[pg 134] less hurtful. by the same [[violent]] heat, they relate that on another [[occasion]] sicily was filled with cinders, so that the houses of the [[city]] catina were destroyed and buried under them,—a calamity which moved the romans to [[pity]] them, and remit their tribute for that year. one may also [[read]] that [[africa]], which had by that [[time]] become a province of [[rome]], was visited by a prodigious multitude of locusts, which, after consuming the fruit and foliage of the trees, were driven into the sea in one vast and measureless cloud; so that when they were drowned and cast upon the shore the air was polluted, and so serious a pestilence produced that in the [[kingdom]] of masinissa alone they say there perished 800,000 persons [[person]], besides a much greater number in the neighbouring districts. at utica they assure us that, of 30,000 soldiers then garrisoning it, there survived only ten. yet which of these disasters, suppose they happened now, would not be attributed to the [[christian]] [[religion]] by those who thus thoughtlessly accuse us, and whom we are compelled to [[answer]]? and yet to their own gods they attribute none of these things, though they [[worship]] them for the sake of escaping lesser calamities of the same [[kind]], and do not reflect that they who formerly worshipped them were not preserved from these serious disasters.

[pg 135]

book fourth.[155]

argument.

in this [[book]] it is proved that the extent and long duration of the roman [[empire]] is to be ascribed, not to jove or the gods of the heathen, to whom individually scarce even [[single]] things and the very basest functions were believed to be entrusted, but to the one true [[god]], the author of felicity, by whose [[power]] and [[judgment]] earthly kingdoms [[kingdom]] are founded and maintained.

1. of the things which have been discussed in the first [[book]].

having begun to speak of the [[city]] of [[god]], i have [[thought]] it necessary first of all to reply to its enemies [[enemy]], who, eagerly pursuing earthly joys, and gaping after transitory things, throw the blame of all the [[sorrow]] they suffer in them—rather through the compassion of [[god]] in admonishing, than his severity in punishing—on the [[christian]] [[religion]], which is the one salutary and true [[religion]]. and since there is among them also an unlearned rabble, they are stirred up as by the [[authority]] of the learned to hate us more bitterly, thinking in their inexperience that things which have happened unwontedly in their days were not wont to happen in other times [[time]] gone by; and whereas this [[opinion]] of theirs is confirmed even by those who [[know]] that it is false, and yet dissemble their [[knowledge]] in order that they may seem to have just cause for murmuring against us, it was necessary, from books [[book]] in which their authors recorded and published the [[history]] of bygone times [[time]] that it might be known, to demonstrate that it is far otherwise than they [[think]]; and at the same [[time]] to [[teach]] that the false gods, whom they openly worshipped, or still [[worship]] in secret, are most unclean spirits, and most malignant and deceitful demons, even to such a pitch that they take delight in crimes which, whether real or[pg 136] only fictitious, are yet their own, which it has been their will to have celebrated in [[honour]] of them at their own festivals; so that [[human]] infirmity cannot be called back from the perpetration of damnable deeds, so long as [[authority]] is furnished for imitating them that seems even [[divine]]. these things we have proved, not from our own conjectures, but partly from recent memory, because we ourselves have seen such things celebrated, and to such deities, partly from the writings of those who have left these things on record to [[posterity]], not as if in reproach, but as in [[honour]] of their own gods. thus varro, a most learned [[man]] among them, and of the weightiest [[authority]], when he made separate books [[book]] concerning things [[human]] and things [[divine]], distributing some among the [[human]], others among the [[divine]], according to the special [[dignity]] of each, placed the scenic plays not at all among things [[human]], but among things [[divine]]; though, certainly, if only there were [[good]] and honest [[men]] in the [[state]], the scenic plays ought not to be allowed even among things [[human]]. and this he did not on his own [[authority]], but because, being born and educated at [[rome]], he found them among the [[divine]] things. now as we briefly stated in the end of the first [[book]] what we intended afterwards to discuss, and as we have disposed of a part of this in the next two books [[book]], we see what our readers will expect us now to take up.

2. of those things which are contained in books [[book]] second and third.

we had promised, then, that we would say something against those who attribute the calamities of the roman [[republic]] to our [[religion]], and that we would recount the evils [[evil]], as many and [[great]] as we could [[remember]] or might deem sufficient, which that [[city]], or the provinces belonging to its [[empire]], had [[suffered]] before their sacrifices [[sacrifice]] were prohibited, all of which would beyond [[doubt]] have been attributed to us, if our [[religion]] had either already shone on them, or had thus prohibited their sacrilegious rites. these things we have, as we [[think]], fully disposed of in the second and third books [[book]], treating in the second of evils [[evil]] in morals [[moral]], which alone or chiefly are to be accounted evils [[evil]]; and in the third, of those which only fools [[fool]] dread to undergo—namely, those of the body[pg 137] or of outward things—which for the most part the [[good]] also suffer. but those evils [[evil]] by which they themselves become [[evil]], they take, i do not say patiently, but with [[pleasure]]. and how few evils [[evil]] have i related concerning that one [[city]] and its empire! not even all down to the [[time]] of cæsar augustus. what if i had chosen to recount and enlarge on those evils [[evil]], not which [[men]] have inflicted on each other, such as the devastations and destructions of [[war]], but which happen in earthly things, from the elements of the [[world]] itself? of such evils [[evil]] apuleius speaks briefly in one passage of that [[book]] which he wrote, de mundo, saying that all earthly things are [[subject]] to [[change]], overthrow, and destruction.[156] for, to use his own words, by excessive earthquakes the ground has burst asunder, and cities [[city]] with their inhabitants have been clean destroyed: by sudden rains whole regions have been washed away; those also which formerly had been continents, have been insulated by [[strange]] and new-come waves, and others, by the subsiding of the sea, have been made passable by the foot of [[man]]: by winds and storms cities [[city]] have been overthrown; fires [[fire]] have flashed forth from the clouds, by which regions in the east being burnt up have perished; and on the western coasts the like destructions have been caused by the bursting forth of waters and floods. so, formerly, from the lofty craters of etna, rivers of [[fire]] kindled by [[god]] have flowed like a torrent down the steeps. if i had wished to collect from [[history]] wherever i could, these and similar instances, where should i have finished what happened even in those times [[time]] before the name of [[christ]] had put down those of their idols, so [[vain]] and hurtful to true salvation? i promised that i should also point out which of their customs, and for what cause, the true [[god]], in whose [[power]] all kingdoms [[kingdom]] are, had deigned to favour to the enlargement of their [[empire]]; and how those whom they [[think]] gods can have profited them nothing, but much rather hurt them by deceiving and beguiling them; so that it seems to me i must now speak of these things, and chiefly of the increase of the roman [[empire]]. for i have already said not a little, especially in the second [[book]], about the many evils [[evil]] introduced into their manners by the hurtful deceits of the[pg 138] demons whom they worshipped as gods. but throughout all the three books [[book]] already completed, where it appeared suitable, we have set forth how much succour [[god]], through the name of [[christ]], to whom the barbarians beyond the custom of [[war]] paid so much [[honour]], has bestowed on the [[good]] and [[bad]], according as it is written, "who maketh his sun to rise on the [[good]] and the [[evil]], and giveth rain to the just and the [[unjust]]."[157]

3. whether the [[great]] extent of the [[empire]], which has been acquired only by wars [[war]], is to be reckoned among the [[good]] things either of the [[wise]] or the [[happy]].

now, therefore, let us see how it is that they dare to ascribe the very [[great]] extent and duration of the roman [[empire]] to those gods whom they contend that they [[worship]] honourably, even by the obsequies of vile games and the ministry of vile [[men]]: although i should like first to inquire for a little what [[reason]], what prudence, there is in wishing to [[glory]] in the greatness and extent of the [[empire]], when you cannot point out the [[happiness]] of [[men]] who are always rolling, with dark [[fear]] and cruel [[lust]], in warlike slaughters and in [[blood]], which, whether shed in civil or [[foreign]] [[war]], is still [[human]] [[blood]]; so that their joy may be compared to glass in its fragile splendour, of which one is horribly afraid lest it should be suddenly broken in pieces. that this may be more easily discerned, let us not come to nought by being carried away with empty boasting, or blunt the edge of our attention by loud-sounding names of things, when we hear of peoples [[people]], kingdoms [[kingdom]], provinces. but let us suppose a case of two [[men]]; for each [[individual]] [[man]], like one letter in a [[language]], is as it were the element of a [[city]] or [[kingdom]], however far-spreading in its occupation of the [[earth]]. of these two [[men]] let us suppose that one is [[poor]], or rather of middling circumstances; the other very [[rich]]. but the [[rich]] [[man]] is anxious with fears [[fear]], pining with discontent, burning with covetousness, never secure, always uneasy, panting from the perpetual strife of his enemies [[enemy]], adding to his patrimony indeed by these miseries to an immense [[degree]], and by these additions also heaping up most bitter cares [[care]]. but that other [[man]] of moderate [[wealth]] is contented with a small and compact estate, most dear to[pg 139] his own [[family]], enjoying the sweetest [[peace]] with his kindred neighbours and [[friends]], in piety [[religious]], benignant in [[mind]], healthy in [[body]], in [[life]] frugal, in manners chaste, in [[conscience]] secure. i [[know]] not whether any one can be such a [[fool]], that he dare hesitate which to prefer. as, therefore, in the case of these two [[men]], so in two families [[family]], in two nations, in two kingdoms [[kingdom]], this test of tranquillity holds [[good]]; and if we apply it vigilantly and without prejudice, we shall quite easily see where the mere show of [[happiness]] dwells, and where real felicity. wherefore if the true [[god]] is worshipped, and if he is served with [[genuine]] rites and true [[virtue]], it is advantageous that [[good]] [[men]] should long reign both far and wide. nor is this advantageous so much to themselves, as to those over whom they reign. for, so far as concerns themselves, their piety and probity, which are [[great]] gifts of [[god]], suffice to give them true felicity, enabling them to [[live]] well the [[life]] that now is, and afterwards to receive that which is eternal. in this [[world]], therefore, the dominion of [[good]] [[men]] is profitable, not so much for themselves as for [[human]] affairs. but the dominion of [[bad]] [[men]] is hurtful chiefly to themselves who [[rule]], for they [[destroy]] their own souls [[soul]] by greater licence in wickedness; while those who are put under them in service are not hurt except by their own [[iniquity]]. for to the just all the evils [[evil]] imposed on them by [[unjust]] rulers are not the [[punishment]] of crime, but the test of [[virtue]]. therefore the [[good]] [[man]], although he is a [[slave]], is [[free]]; but the [[bad]] [[man]], even if he reigns, is a [[slave]], and that not of one [[man]], but, what is far more grievous, of as many masters as he has vices [[vice]]; of which vices [[vice]] when the [[divine]] [[scripture]] treats, it says, "for of whom any [[man]] is overcome, to the same he is also the bond-slave."[158]

4. how like kingdoms [[kingdom]] without [[justice]] are to robberies.

justice being taken away, then, what are kingdoms [[kingdom]] but [[great]] robberies? for what are robberies themselves, but little kingdoms [[kingdom]]? the band itself is made up of [[men]]; it is ruled by the [[authority]] of a [[prince]], it is knit together by the pact of the confederacy; the booty is divided by the [[law]] agreed on. if, by the admittance of abandoned [[men]], this [[evil]] increases[pg 140] to such a [[degree]] that it holds places, fixes abodes, takes possession of cities [[city]], and subdues peoples [[people]], it assumes the more plainly the name of a [[kingdom]], because the reality is now manifestly conferred on it, not by the removal of covetousness, but by the addition of impunity. indeed, that was an apt and true reply which was given to alexander the [[great]] by a pirate who had been seized. for when that [[king]] had [[asked]] the [[man]] what he meant by keeping hostile possession of the sea, he answered with bold [[pride]], "what thou meanest by seizing the whole [[earth]]; but because i do it with a petty ship, i am called a robber, whilst thou who dost it with a [[great]] fleet art [[arts]] styled [[emperor]]."[159]

5. of the runaway gladiators whose [[power]] became like that of [[royal]] [[dignity]].

i shall not therefore stay to inquire what sort of [[men]] romulus gathered together, seeing he deliberated much about them,—how, being assumed out of that [[life]] they [[led]] into the fellowship of his [[city]], they might cease to [[think]] of the [[punishment]] they deserved, the [[fear]] of which had driven them to greater villanies; so that henceforth they might be made more peaceable members of [[society]]. but this i say, that the roman [[empire]], which by subduing many nations had already grown [[great]] and an object of universal dread, was itself greatly alarmed, and only with much difficulty avoided a disastrous overthrow, because a mere handful of gladiators in campania, escaping from the games, had recruited a [[great]] [[army]], appointed three generals, and most widely and cruelly devastated [[italy]]. let them say what [[god]] aided these [[men]], so that from a small and contemptible band of robbers they attained to a [[kingdom]], feared even by the romans, who had such [[great]] forces [[force]] and fortresses. or will they deny that they were divinely aided because they did not [[last]] long?[160] as if, indeed, the [[life]] of any [[man]] whatever lasted long. in that case, too, the gods aid no one to reign, since all individuals [[individual]] quickly [[die]]; nor is [[sovereign]] [[power]] to be reckoned a benefit, because in a little [[time]] in every [[man]], and thus in all of them one by one, it vanishes like a vapour. for what does it matter to those[pg 141] who worshipped the gods under romulus, and are long since [[dead]], that after their [[death]] the roman [[empire]] has grown so [[great]], while they plead their causes before the powers [[power]] beneath? whether those causes are [[good]] or [[bad]], it matters not to the [[question]] before us. and this is to be understood of all those who carry with them the heavy burden of their actions, having in the few days of their [[life]] swiftly and hurriedly passed over the stage of the imperial office, although the office itself has lasted through long spaces of [[time]], being filled by a constant succession of dying [[men]]. if, however, even those benefits which [[last]] only for the shortest [[time]] are to be ascribed to the aid of the gods, these gladiators were not a little aided, who broke the bonds of their servile condition, fled, escaped, raised a [[great]] and most powerful [[army]], [[obedient]] to the will and orders of their chiefs [[chief]] and much feared by the roman majesty, and remaining unsubdued by several roman generals, seized many places, and, having won very many victories [[victory]], enjoyed whatever pleasures [[pleasure]] they wished, and did what their [[lust]] suggested, and, until at [[last]] they were conquered, which was done with the utmost difficulty, lived sublime and dominant. but let us come to greater matters.

6. concerning the covetousness of ninus, who was the first who made [[war]] on his neighbours, that he might [[rule]] more widely.

justinus, who wrote [[greek]] or rather [[foreign]] [[history]] in latin, and briefly, like trogus pompeius whom he followed, begins his [[work]] thus: "in the beginning of the affairs of peoples [[people]] and nations the [[government]] was in the hands of kings [[king]], who were raised to the height of this majesty not by courting the [[people]], but by the [[knowledge]] [[good]] [[men]] had of their moderation. the [[people]] were held bound by no laws [[law]]; the decisions of the princes [[prince]] were instead of laws [[law]]. it was the custom to guard rather than to extend the boundaries of the [[empire]]; and kingdoms [[kingdom]] were kept within the bounds of each ruler's native [[land]]. ninus [[king]] of the assyrians first of all, through new [[lust]] of [[empire]], changed the old and, as it were, ancestral custom of nations. he first made [[war]] on his neighbours, and wholly subdued as far as to the frontiers of libya the nations as yet untrained to resist." and a little after he says: "ninus established by constant possession the greatness of the[pg 142] [[authority]] he had gained. having mastered his nearest neighbours, he went on to others, strengthened by the accession of forces [[force]], and by making each fresh [[victory]] the instrument of that which followed, subdued the nations of the whole east." now, with whatever fidelity to [[fact]] either he or trogus may in general have written—for that they sometimes told lies [[lie]] is shown by other more trustworthy writers—yet it is agreed among other authors, that the [[kingdom]] of the assyrians was extended far and wide by [[king]] ninus. and it lasted so long, that the roman [[empire]] has not yet attained the same [[age]]; for, as those write who have treated of chronological [[history]], this [[kingdom]] endured for twelve hundred and forty years from the first year in which ninus began to reign, until it was transferred to the medes. but to make [[war]] on your neighbours, and thence to proceed to others, and through mere [[lust]] of dominion to crush and subdue [[people]] who do you no harm, what else is this to be called than [[great]] robbery?

7. whether earthly kingdoms [[kingdom]] in their rise and fall have been either aided or deserted by the [[help]] of the gods.

if this [[kingdom]] was so [[great]] and lasting without the aid of the gods, why is the ample territory and long duration of the roman [[empire]] to be ascribed to the roman gods? for whatever is the cause in it, the same is in the other also. but if they contend that the [[prosperity]] of the other also is to be attributed to the aid of the gods, i ask of which? for the other nations whom ninus overcame, did not then [[worship]] other gods. or if the assyrians had gods of their own, who, so to speak, were more skilful workmen in the construction and preservation of the [[empire]], whether are they [[dead]], since they themselves have also lost the [[empire]]; or, having been defrauded of their [[pay]], or promised a greater, have they chosen rather to go over to the medes, and from them again to the persians, because cyrus invited them, and promised them something still more advantageous? this nation, indeed, since the [[time]] of the [[kingdom]] of alexander the macedonian, which was as brief in duration as it was [[great]] in extent, has preserved its own [[empire]], and at this day occupies no small territories in the east. if this is so, then either the gods are unfaithful, who desert their own and go over to their enemies [[enemy]],[pg 143] which camillus, who was but a [[man]], did not do, when, being victor and subduer of a most hostile [[state]], although he had [[felt]] that [[rome]], for whom he had done so much, was ungrateful, yet afterwards, forgetting the injury and remembering his native [[land]], he freed her again from the gauls; or they are not so [[strong]] as gods ought to be, since they can be overcome by [[human]] [[skill]] or [[strength]]. or if, when they carry on [[war]] among themselves, the gods are not overcome by [[men]], but some gods who are peculiar to [[certain]] cities [[city]] are perchance overcome by other gods, it follows that they have quarrels among themselves which they uphold, each for his own part. therefore a [[city]] ought not to [[worship]] its own gods, but rather others who aid their own worshippers. finally, whatever may have been the case as to this [[change]] of sides, or flight, or migration, or failure in [[battle]] on the part of the gods, the name of [[christ]] had not yet been proclaimed in those parts of the [[earth]] when these kingdoms [[kingdom]] were lost and transferred through [[great]] destructions in [[war]]. for if, after more than twelve hundred years, when the [[kingdom]] was taken away from the assyrians, the [[christian]] [[religion]] had there already preached another eternal [[kingdom]], and put a stop to the sacrilegious [[worship]] of false gods, what else would the foolish [[men]] of that nation have said, but that the [[kingdom]] which had been so long preserved, could be lost for no other cause than the desertion of their own religions [[religion]] and the reception of [[christianity]]? in which foolish [[speech]] that might have been uttered, let those we speak of observe their own likeness, and blush, if there is any sense of shame in them, because they have uttered similar complaints; although the roman [[empire]] is afflicted rather than changed,—a thing which has befallen it in other times [[time]] also, before the name of [[christ]] was heard, and it has been restored after such affliction,—a thing which even in these times [[time]] is not to be despaired of. for who knows [[know]] the will of [[god]] concerning this matter?

8. which of the gods can the romans suppose presided over the increase and preservation of their [[empire]], when they have believed that even the [[care]] of [[single]] things could scarcely be committed to [[single]] gods?

next let us ask, if they please, out of so [[great]] a crowd of gods which the romans [[worship]], whom in especial, or what[pg 144] gods they [[believe]] to have extended and preserved that [[empire]]. now, surely of this [[work]], which is so excellent and so very full of the highest [[dignity]], they dare not ascribe any part to the [[goddess]] cloacina;[161] or to volupia, who has her appellation from voluptuousness; or to libentina, who has her name from [[lust]]; or to vaticanus, who presides over the screaming of infants; or to cunina, who rules [[rule]] over their cradles. but how is it possible to recount in one part of this [[book]] all the names of gods or goddesses [[goddess]], which they could scarcely comprise in [[great]] volumes, distributing among these divinities their peculiar offices about [[single]] things? they have not even [[thought]] that the charge of their lands [[land]] should be committed to any one [[god]]: but they have entrusted their farms to rusina; the ridges of the mountains to jugatinus; over the downs they have set the [[goddess]] collatina; over the valleys, vallonia. nor could they even find one segetia so competent, that they could commend to her [[care]] all their corn crops at once; but so long as their seed-corn was still under the ground, they would have the [[goddess]] seia set over it; then, whenever it was above ground and formed straw, they set over it the [[goddess]] segetia; and when the grain was collected and stored, they set over it the [[goddess]] tutilina, that it might be kept safe. who would not have [[thought]] that [[goddess]] segetia sufficient to take [[care]] of the standing corn until it had passed from the first green blades to the dry ears? yet she was not enough for [[men]], who loved a multitude of gods, that the miserable [[soul]], despising the chaste embrace of the one true [[god]], should be prostituted to a crowd of demons. therefore they set proserpina over the germinating seeds; over the joints and knots of the stems, the [[god]] nodotus; over the sheaths enfolding the ears, the [[goddess]] volutina; when the sheaths opened that the spike might shoot forth, it was ascribed to the [[goddess]] patelana; when the stems stood all [[equal]] with new ears, because the ancients described this[pg 145] equalizing by the term hostire, it was ascribed to the [[goddess]] hostilina; when the grain was in flower, it was dedicated to the [[goddess]] flora; when full of milk, to the [[god]] lacturnus; when maturing, to the [[goddess]] matuta; when the crop was runcated,—that is, removed from the soil,—to the [[goddess]] runcina. nor do i yet recount them all, for i am sick of all this, though it gives them no shame. only, i have said these very few things, in order that it may be understood they dare by no means say that the roman [[empire]] has been established, increased, and preserved by their deities, who had all their own functions assigned to them in such a way, that no general oversight was entrusted to any one of them. when, therefore, could segetia take [[care]] of the [[empire]], who was not allowed to take [[care]] of the corn and the trees? when could cunina take [[thought]] about [[war]], whose oversight was not allowed to go beyond the cradles of the babies? when could nodotus give [[help]] in [[battle]], who had nothing to do even with the sheath of the ear, but only with the knots of the joints? every one sets a porter at the door of his house, and because he is a [[man]], he is quite sufficient; but these [[people]] have set three gods, forculus to the doors, cardea to the hinge, limentinus to the threshold.[162] thus forculus could not at the same [[time]] take [[care]] also of the hinge and the threshold.

9. whether the [[great]] extent and long duration of the roman [[empire]] should be ascribed to jove, whom his worshippers [[believe]] to be the [[chief]] [[god]].

therefore omitting, or passing by for a little, that crowd of petty gods, we ought to inquire into the part performed by the [[great]] gods, whereby [[rome]] has been made so [[great]] as to reign so long over so many nations. doubtless, therefore, this is the [[work]] of jove. for they will have it that he is the [[king]] of all the gods and goddesses [[goddess]], as is shown by his sceptre and by the capitol on the lofty hill. concerning that [[god]] they publish a saying which, although that of a poet, is most apt, "all things are full of jove."[163] varro believes [[belief]] that this [[god]] is worshipped, although called by another name, even by those who [[worship]] one [[god]] alone without any image. but[pg 146] if this is so, why has he been so badly used at [[rome]] (and indeed by other nations too), that an image of him should be made?—a thing which was so displeasing to varro himself, that although he was overborne by the perverse custom of so [[great]] a [[city]], he had not the least hesitation in both saying and writing, that those who have appointed images for the [[people]] have both taken away [[fear]] and added error.

10. what opinions [[opinion]] those have followed who have set divers gods over divers parts of the [[world]].

why, also, is juno [[united]] to him as his [[wife]], who is called at once "sister and yokefellow?"[164] because, say they, we have jove in the ether, juno in the air; and these two elements are [[united]], the one being superior, the other inferior. it is not he, then, of whom it is said, "all things are full of jove," if juno also fills some part. does each fill either, and are both of this couple in both of these elements, and in each of them at the same [[time]]? why, then, is the ether given to jove, the air to juno? besides, these two should have been enough. why is it that the sea is assigned to [[neptune]], the [[earth]] to pluto? and that these also might not be left without mates, salacia is joined to [[neptune]], proserpine to pluto. for they say that, as juno possesses the lower part of the heavens [[heaven]],—that is, the air,—so salacia possesses the lower part of the sea, and proserpine the lower part of the [[earth]]. they seek how they may patch up these fables, but they find no way. for if these things were so, their ancient sages would have maintained that there are three [[chief]] elements of the [[world]], not four, in order that each of the elements might have a pair of gods. now, they have positively affirmed that the ether is one thing, the air another. but water, whether higher or lower, is surely water. suppose it ever so unlike, can it ever be so much so as no longer to be water? and the lower [[earth]], by whatever divinity it may be distinguished, what else can it be than [[earth]]? lo, then, since the whole physical [[world]] is complete in these four or three elements, where shall minerva be? what should she possess, what should she fill? for she is placed in the capitol along with these two, although she is not the offspring of their [[marriage]]. or if they say that[pg 147] she possesses the higher part of the ether,—and on that account the poets have feigned that she sprang from the head of jove,—why then is she not rather reckoned queen of the gods, because she is superior to jove? is it because it would be improper to set the [[daughter]] before the [[father]]? why, then, is not that [[rule]] of [[justice]] observed concerning jove himself toward saturn? is it because he was conquered? have they fought then? by no means, say they; that is an old wife's fable. lo, we are not to [[believe]] fables, and must hold more worthy opinions [[opinion]] concerning the gods! why, then, do they not assign to the [[father]] of jove a seat, if not of higher, at least of [[equal]] [[honour]]? because saturn, say they, is length of [[time]].[165] therefore they who [[worship]] saturn [[worship]] [[time]]; and it is insinuated that [[jupiter]], the [[king]] of the gods, was born of [[time]]. for is anything unworthy said when [[jupiter]] and juno are said to have been sprung from [[time]], if he is the [[heaven]] and she is the [[earth]], since both [[heaven]] and [[earth]] have been made, and are therefore not eternal? for their learned and [[wise]] [[men]] have this also in their books [[book]]. nor is that saying taken by [[virgil]] out of poetic figments, but out of the books [[book]] of [[philosophers]],

"then ether, the [[father]] almighty, in copious showers descended into his spouse's glad bosom, making it fertile,"[166]
—that is, into the bosom of tellus, or the [[earth]]. although here, also, they will have it that there are some differences, and [[think]] that in the [[earth]] herself terra is one thing, tellus another, and tellumo another. and they have all these as gods, called by their own names, distinguished by their own offices, and venerated with their own altars and rites. this same [[earth]] also they call the [[mother]] of the gods, so that even the fictions of the poets are more tolerable, if, according, not to their poetical but [[sacred]] books [[book]], juno is not only the sister and [[wife]], but also the [[mother]] of jove. the same [[earth]] they [[worship]] as ceres, and also as vesta; while yet they more frequently affirm that vesta is nothing else than [[fire]], pertaining to the hearths, without which the [[city]] cannot [[exist]]; and therefore virgins are wont to serve her, because as nothing is born of a virgin, so nothing is born of [[fire]];—but all this[pg 148] nonsense ought to be completely abolished and extinguished by him who is born of a virgin. for who can bear that, while they ascribe to the [[fire]] so much [[honour]], and, as it were, chastity, they do not blush sometimes even to call vesta [[venus]], so that honoured virginity may vanish in her handmaidens? for if vesta is [[venus]], how can virgins rightly serve her by abstaining from venery? are there two venuses, the one a virgin, the other not a maid? or rather, are there three, one the [[goddess]] of virgins, who is also called vesta, another the [[goddess]] of wives [[wife]], and another of harlots? to her also the phenicians offered a gift by prostituting their daughters [[daughter]] before they [[united]] them to husbands.[167] which of these is the [[wife]] of vulcan? certainly not the virgin, since she has a husband. far be it from us to say it is the harlot, lest we should seem to [[wrong]] the [[son]] of juno and fellow-worker of minerva. therefore it is to be understood that she belongs to the [[married]] [[people]]; but we would not [[wish]] them to imitate her in what she did with [[mars]]. "again," say they, "you return to fables." what sort of [[justice]] is that, to be angry with us because we say such things of their gods, and not to be angry with themselves, who in their theatres most willingly behold the crimes of their gods? and,—a thing incredible, if it were not thoroughly well proved,—these very theatric representations of the crimes of their gods have been instituted in [[honour]] of these same gods.

11. concerning the many gods whom the pagan doctors defend as being one and the same jove.

let them therefore assert as many things as ever they please in physical reasonings and disputations. one while let [[jupiter]] be the [[soul]] of this corporeal [[world]], who fills and moves that whole mass, constructed and compacted out of four, or as many elements as they please; another while, let him yield to his sister and brothers [[brother]] their parts of it: now let him be the ether, that from above he may embrace juno, the air spread out beneath; again, let him be the whole [[heaven]] along with the air, and impregnate with fertilizing showers and seeds the [[earth]], as his [[wife]], and, at the same [[time]], his[pg 149] [[mother]] (for this is not vile in [[divine]] beings); and yet again (that it may not be necessary to run through them all), let him, the one [[god]], of whom many [[think]] it has been said by a most [[noble]] poet,

"for [[god]] pervadeth all things, all lands [[land]], and the tracts of the sea, and the depth of the heavens [[heaven]],"[168]—
let it be him who in the ether is [[jupiter]]; in the air, juno; in the sea, [[neptune]]; in the lower parts of the sea, salacia; in the [[earth]], pluto; in the lower part of the [[earth]], proserpine; on the domestic hearths, vesta; in the furnace of the workmen, vulcan; among the stars, sol, and luna, and the stars; in divination, [[apollo]]; in merchandise, mercury; in janus, the initiator; in terminus, the terminator; saturn, in [[time]]; [[mars]] and bellona, in [[war]]; liber, in vineyards; ceres, in corn-fields; diana, in forests; minerva, in learning. finally, let it be him who is in that crowd, as it were, of plebeian gods: let him preside under the name of liber over the seed of [[men]], and under that of libera over that of [[women]]: let him be diespiter, who brings forth the birth to the [[light]] of day: let him be the [[goddess]] mena, whom they set over the menstruation of [[women]]: let him be lucina, who is invoked by [[women]] in childbirth: let him bring [[help]] to those who are being born, by taking them up from the bosom of the [[earth]], and let him be called opis: let him open the mouth in the crying babe, and be called the [[god]] vaticanus: let him lift it from the [[earth]], and be called the [[goddess]] levana; let him watch over cradles, and be called the [[goddess]] cunina: let it be no other than he who is in those goddesses [[goddess]], who sing the fates [[fate]] of the new born, and are called carmentes: let him preside over fortuitous events, and be called fortuna: in the [[goddess]] rumina, let him milk out the breast to the little one, because the ancients termed the breast ruma: in the [[goddess]] potina, let him administer drink: in the [[goddess]] educa, let him supply food: from the terror of infants, let him be styled paventia: from the [[hope]] which comes, venilia; from voluptuousness, volupia; from action, agenor: from the stimulants by which [[man]] is spurred on to much action, let him be named the [[goddess]] stimula: let him be the [[goddess]] strenia, for making[pg 150] strenuous; numeria, who teaches [[teach]] to number; camœna, who teaches [[teach]] to sing: let him be both the [[god]] consus for granting counsel, and the [[goddess]] sentia for inspiring sentences: let him be the [[goddess]] juventas, who, after the robe of boyhood is laid aside, takes charge of the beginning of the youthful [[age]]: let him be fortuna barbata, who endues adults with a beard, whom they have not chosen to [[honour]]; so that this divinity, whatever it may be, should at least be a male [[god]], named either barbatus, from barba, like nodotus, from nodus; or, certainly, not fortuna, but because he has beards, fortunius: let him, in the [[god]] jugatinus, yoke couples in [[marriage]]; and when the girdle of the virgin [[wife]] is loosed, let him be invoked as the [[goddess]] virginiensis: let him be mutunus or tuternus, who, among the greeks [[greek]], is called priapus. if they are not ashamed of it, let all these which i have named, and whatever others i have not named (for i have not [[thought]] fit to name all), let all these gods and goddesses [[goddess]] be that one [[jupiter]], whether, as some will have it, all these are parts of him, or are his powers [[power]], as those [[think]] who are pleased to consider him the [[soul]] of the [[world]], which is the [[opinion]] of most of their doctors, and these the [[greatest]]. if these things are so (how [[evil]] they may be i do not yet meanwhile inquire), what would they lose, if they, by a more prudent abridgment, should [[worship]] one [[god]]? for what part of him could be contemned if he himself should be worshipped? but if they are afraid lest parts of him should be angry at being passed by or neglected, then it is not the case, as they will have it, that this whole is as the [[life]] of one living being, which contains all the gods together, as if they were its virtues [[virtue]], or members, or parts; but each part has its own [[life]] separate from the rest, if it is so that one can be angered, appeased, or stirred up more than another. but if it is said that all together,—that is, the whole jove himself,—would be offended if his parts were not also worshipped singly and minutely, it is foolishly spoken. surely none of them could be passed by if he who singly possesses them all should be worshipped. for, to omit other things which are innumerable, when they say that all the stars are parts of jove, and are all alive, and have [[rational]] souls [[soul]], and therefore[pg 151] without controversy are gods, can they not see how many they do not [[worship]], to how many they do not build temples or set up altars, and to how very few, in [[fact]], of the stars they have [[thought]] of setting them up and offering [[sacrifice]]? if, therefore, those are displeased who are not severally worshipped, do they not [[fear]] to [[live]] with only a few appeased, while all [[heaven]] is displeased? but if they [[worship]] all the stars because they are part of jove whom they [[worship]], by the same compendious method they could supplicate them all in him alone. for in this way no one would be displeased, since in him alone all would be supplicated. no one would be contemned, instead of there being just cause of displeasure given to the much greater number who are passed by in the [[worship]] offered to some; especially when priapus, stretched out in vile nakedness, is preferred to those who shine from their supernal abode.

12. concerning the [[opinion]] of those who have [[thought]] that [[god]] is the [[soul]] of the [[world]], and the [[world]] is the [[body]] of [[god]].

ought not [[men]] of [[intelligence]], and indeed [[men]] of every [[kind]], to be stirred up to examine the [[nature]] of this [[opinion]]? for there is no need of excellent capacity for this task, that putting away the [[desire]] of contention, they may observe that if [[god]] is the [[soul]] of the [[world]], and the [[world]] is as a [[body]] to him, who is the [[soul]], he must be one living being consisting of [[soul]] and [[body]], and that this same [[god]] is a [[kind]] of womb of [[nature]] containing all things in himself, so that the lives [[life]] and souls [[soul]] of all living things are taken, according to the manner of each one's birth, out of his [[soul]] which vivifies that whole mass, and therefore nothing at all remains which is not a part of [[god]]. and if this is so, who cannot see what impious and irreligious consequences [[follow]], such as that whatever one may trample, he must trample a part of [[god]], and in slaying any living creature, a part of [[god]] must be slaughtered? but i am unwilling to utter all that may occur to those who [[think]] of it, yet cannot be spoken without irreverence.

13. concerning those who assert that only [[rational]] animals are parts of the one [[god]].

but if they contend that only [[rational]] animals, such as [[men]], are parts of [[god]], i do not really see how, if the whole[pg 152] [[world]] is [[god]], they can separate beasts from being parts of him. but what need is there of striving about that? concerning the [[rational]] animal himself,—that is, [[man]],—what more unhappy [[belief]] can be entertained than that a part of [[god]] is whipped when a boy is whipped? and who, unless he is quite mad, could bear the [[thought]] that parts of [[god]] can become lascivious, iniquitous, impious, and altogether damnable? in brief, why is [[god]] angry at those who do not [[worship]] him, since these offenders are parts of himself? it remains, therefore, that they must say that all the gods have their own lives [[life]]; that each one lives [[life]] for himself, and none of them is a part of any one; but that all are to be worshipped,—at least as many as can be known and worshipped; for they are so many it is impossible that all can be so. and of all these, i [[believe]] that [[jupiter]], because he presides as [[king]], is [[thought]] by them to have both established and extended the roman [[empire]]. for if he has not done it, what other [[god]] do they [[believe]] could have attempted so [[great]] a [[work]], when they must all be occupied with their own offices and works [[work]], nor can one intrude on that of another? could the [[kingdom]] of [[men]] then be propagated and increased by the [[king]] of the gods?

14. the enlargement of kingdoms [[kingdom]] is unsuitably ascribed to jove; for if, as they will have it, victoria is a [[goddess]], she alone would suffice for this [[business]].

here, first of all, i ask, why even the [[kingdom]] itself is not some [[god]]? for why should not it also be so, if [[victory]] is a [[goddess]]? or what need is there of jove himself in this affair, if [[victory]] favours and is propitious, and always goes to those whom she wishes [[wish]] to be victorious? with this [[goddess]] favourable and propitious, even if jove was idle and did nothing, what nations could remain unsubdued, what [[kingdom]] would not yield? but perhaps it is displeasing to [[good]] [[men]] to [[fight]] with most wicked unrighteousness, and provoke with voluntary [[war]] neighbours who are peaceable and do no [[wrong]], in order to enlarge a [[kingdom]]? if they [[feel]] thus, i entirely approve and [[praise]] them.

15. whether it is suitable for [[good]] [[men]] to [[wish]] to [[rule]] more widely.

let them ask, then, whether it is quite fitting for [[good]] [[men]] to rejoice in extended [[empire]]. for the [[iniquity]] of[pg 153] those with whom just wars [[war]] are carried on favours the [[growth]] of a [[kingdom]], which would certainly have been small if the [[peace]] and [[justice]] of neighbours had not by any [[wrong]] provoked the carrying on of [[war]] against them; and [[human]] affairs being thus more [[happy]], all kingdoms [[kingdom]] would have been small, rejoicing in neighbourly concord; and thus there would have been very many kingdoms [[kingdom]] of nations in the [[world]], as there are very many houses of [[citizens]] in a [[city]]. therefore, to carry on [[war]] and extend a [[kingdom]] over wholly subdued nations seems to [[bad]] [[men]] to be felicity, to [[good]] [[men]] necessity. but because it would be worse that the injurious should [[rule]] over those who are more righteous, therefore even that is not unsuitably called felicity. but beyond [[doubt]] it is greater felicity to have a [[good]] neighbour at [[peace]], than to conquer a [[bad]] one by making [[war]]. your wishes [[wish]] are [[bad]], when you [[desire]] that one whom you hate or [[fear]] should be in such a condition that you can conquer him. if, therefore, by carrying on wars [[war]] that were just, not impious or unrighteous, the romans could have acquired so [[great]] an [[empire]], ought they not to [[worship]] as a [[goddess]] even the [[injustice]] of foreigners? for we see that this has co-operated much in extending the [[empire]], by making foreigners so [[unjust]] that they became [[people]] with whom just wars [[war]] might be carried on, and the [[empire]] increased. and why may not [[injustice]], at least that of [[foreign]] nations, also be a [[goddess]], if [[fear]] and dread, and ague have deserved to be roman gods? by these two, therefore,—that is, by [[foreign]] [[injustice]], and the [[goddess]] victoria, for [[injustice]] stirs up causes of wars [[war]], and victoria brings these same wars [[war]] to a [[happy]] termination,—the [[empire]] has increased, even although jove has been idle. for what part could jove have here, when those things which might be [[thought]] to be his benefits are held to be gods, called gods, worshipped as gods, and are themselves invoked for their own parts? he also might have some part here, if he himself might be called [[empire]], just as she is called [[victory]]. or if [[empire]] is the gift of jove, why may not [[victory]] also be held to be his gift? and it certainly would have been held to be so, had he been recognised and worshipped, not as a stone in the capitol, but as the true [[king]] of kings [[king]] and [[lord]] of lords [[lord]].

[pg 154]

16. what was the [[reason]] why the romans, in detailing separate gods for all things and all movements of the [[mind]], chose to have the temple of quiet outside the gates.

but i wonder very much, that while they assigned to separate gods [[single]] things, and (well nigh) all movements of the [[mind]]; that while they invoked the [[goddess]] agenoria, who should excite to action; the [[goddess]] stimula, who should stimulate to unusual action; the [[goddess]] murcia, who should not move [[men]] beyond measure, but make them, as pomponius says, murcid—that is, too slothful and inactive; the [[goddess]] strenua, who should make them strenuous; and that while they offered to all these gods and goddesses [[goddess]] solemn and [[public]] [[worship]], they should yet have been unwilling to give [[public]] acknowledgment to her whom they name quies because she makes [[men]] quiet, but built her temple outside the colline gate. whether was this a symptom of an unquiet [[mind]], or rather was it thus intimated that he who should persevere in worshipping that crowd, not, to be sure, of gods, but of demons, could not dwell with quiet; to which the true physician calls, saying, "learn of me, for i am meek and lowly in [[heart]], and ye shall find rest unto your souls [[soul]]?"

17. whether, if the highest [[power]] belongs to jove, victoria also ought to be worshipped.

or do they say, perhaps, that [[jupiter]] sends the [[goddess]] victoria, and that she, as it were, acting in [[obedience]] to the [[king]] of the gods, comes to those to whom he may have despatched her, and takes up her quarters on their side? this is truly said, not of jove, whom they, according to their own [[imagination]], feign to be [[king]] of the gods, but of him who is the true eternal [[king]], because he sends, not [[victory]], who is no [[person]], but his angel, and causes whom he pleases to conquer; whose counsel may be hidden, but cannot be [[unjust]]. for if [[victory]] is a [[goddess]], why is not triumph also a [[god]], and joined to [[victory]] either as husband, or [[brother]], or [[son]]? indeed, they have imagined such things concerning the gods, that if the poets had feigned the like, and they should have been discussed by us, they would have replied that they were laughable figments of the poets not to be attributed to true deities. and yet they themselves did not laugh when they[pg 155] were, not reading in the poets, but worshipping in the temples such doating follies. therefore they should entreat jove alone for all things, and supplicate him only. for if [[victory]] is a [[goddess]], and is under him as her [[king]], wherever he might have sent her, she could not dare to resist and do her own will rather than his.

18. with what [[reason]] they who [[think]] felicity and [[fortune]] goddesses [[goddess]] have distinguished them.

what shall we say, besides, of the [[idea]] that felicity also is a [[goddess]]? she has received a temple; she has merited an altar; suitable rites of [[worship]] are paid to her. she alone, then, should be worshipped. for where she is [[present]], what [[good]] thing can be absent? but what does a [[man]] [[wish]], that he thinks [[think]] [[fortune]] also a [[goddess]] and worships her? is felicity one thing, [[fortune]] another? [[fortune]], indeed, may be [[bad]] as well as [[good]]; but felicity, if it could be [[bad]], would not be felicity. certainly we ought to [[think]] all the gods of either [[sex]] (if they also have sex) are only [[good]]. this says [[plato]]; this say other [[philosophers]]; this say all estimable rulers of the [[republic]] and the nations. how is it, then, that the [[goddess]] [[fortune]] is sometimes [[good]], sometimes [[bad]]? is it perhaps the case that when she is [[bad]] she is not a [[goddess]], but is suddenly changed into a malignant demon? how many fortunes [[fortune]] are there then? just as many as there are [[men]] who are fortunate, that is, of [[good]] [[fortune]]. but since there must also be very many others who at the very same [[time]] are [[men]] of [[bad]] [[fortune]], could she, being one and the same [[fortune]], be at the same [[time]] both [[bad]] and good—the one to these, the other to those? she who is the [[goddess]], is she always [[good]]? then she herself is felicity. why, then, are two names given her? yet this is tolerable; for it is customary that one thing should be called by two names. but why different temples, different altars, different rituals? there is a [[reason]], say they, because felicity is she whom the [[good]] have by previous [[merit]]; but [[fortune]], which is termed [[good]] without any [[trial]] of [[merit]], befalls both [[good]] and [[bad]] [[men]] fortuitously, whence also she is named [[fortune]]. how, therefore, is she [[good]], who without any discernment comes both to the [[good]] and to the [[bad]]? why is she worshipped,[pg 156] who is thus blind, running at random on any one whatever, so that for the most part she passes by her worshippers, and cleaves to those who despise her? or if her worshippers [[profit]] somewhat, so that they are seen by her and loved, then she follows [[merit]], and does not come fortuitously. what, then, becomes of that definition of [[fortune]]? what becomes of the [[opinion]] that she has received her very name from fortuitous events? for it profits [[profit]] one nothing to [[worship]] her if she is truly [[fortune]]. but if she distinguishes her worshippers, so that she may benefit them, she is not [[fortune]]. or does [[jupiter]] send her too, whither he pleases? then let him alone be worshipped; because [[fortune]] is not able to resist him when he commands her, and sends her where he pleases. or, at least, let the [[bad]] [[worship]] her, who do not choose to have [[merit]] by which the [[goddess]] felicity might be invited.

19. concerning fortuna muliebris.[169]

to this supposed deity, whom they call fortuna, they ascribe so much, indeed, that they have a tradition that the image of her, which was dedicated by the roman matrons, and called fortuna muliebris, has spoken, and has said, once and again, that the matrons pleased her by their homage; which, indeed, if it is true, ought not to excite our wonder. for it is not so difficult for malignant demons to [[deceive]], and they ought the rather to advert to their wits and wiles, because it is that [[goddess]] who comes by haphazard who has spoken, and not she who comes to [[reward]] [[merit]]. for fortuna was loquacious, and felicitas mute; and for what other [[reason]] but that [[men]] might not [[care]] to [[live]] rightly, having made fortuna their friend, who could make them fortunate without any [[good]] desert? and truly, if fortuna speaks, she should at least speak, not with a womanly, but with a manly voice; lest they themselves who have dedicated the image should [[think]] so [[great]] a miracle has been wrought by feminine loquacity.

20. concerning [[virtue]] and [[faith]], which the pagans have honoured with temples and [[sacred]] rites, passing by other [[good]] qualities, which ought likewise to have been worshipped, if deity was rightly attributed to these.

they have made [[virtue]] also a [[goddess]], which, indeed, if it[pg 157] could be a [[goddess]], had been preferable to many. and now, because it is not a [[goddess]], but a gift of [[god]], let it be obtained by prayer from him, by whom alone it can be given, and the whole crowd of false gods vanishes. but why is [[faith]] believed to be a [[goddess]], and why does she herself receive temple and altar? for whoever prudently acknowledges her makes his own [[self]] an abode for her. but how do they [[know]] what [[faith]] is, of which it is the prime and [[greatest]] function that the true [[god]] may be believed in? but why had not [[virtue]] sufficed? does it not include [[faith]] also? forasmuch as they have [[thought]] proper to distribute [[virtue]] into four divisions—prudence, [[justice]], fortitude, and temperance—and as each of these divisions has its own virtues [[virtue]], [[faith]] is among the parts of [[justice]], and has the [[chief]] place with as many of us as [[know]] what that saying means, "the just shall [[live]] by [[faith]]."[170] but if [[faith]] is a [[goddess]], i wonder why these keen lovers of a multitude of gods have wronged so many other goddesses [[goddess]], by passing them by, when they could have dedicated temples and altars to them likewise. why has temperance not deserved to be a [[goddess]], when some roman princes [[prince]] have obtained no small [[glory]] on account of her? why, in fine, is fortitude not a [[goddess]], who aided mucius when he thrust his [[right]] hand into the flames; who aided curtius, when for the sake of his [[country]] he threw himself headlong into the yawning [[earth]]; who aided decius the sire, and decius the [[son]], when they devoted themselves for the [[army]]?—though we might [[question]] whether these [[men]] had true fortitude, if this concerned our [[present]] discussion. why have prudence and [[wisdom]] merited no place among the gods? is it because they are all worshipped under the general name of [[virtue]] itself? then they could thus [[worship]] the true [[god]] also, of whom all the other gods are [[thought]] to be parts. but in that one name of [[virtue]] is comprehended both [[faith]] and chastity, which yet have obtained separate altars in temples of their own.

21. that although not understanding them to be the gifts of [[god]], they ought at least to have been content with [[virtue]] and felicity.

these, not verity but vanity has made goddesses [[goddess]]. for these are gifts of the true [[god]], not themselves goddesses [[goddess]].[pg 158] however, where [[virtue]] and felicity are, what else is sought for? what can suffice the [[man]] whom [[virtue]] and felicity do not suffice? for surely [[virtue]] comprehends all things we need do, felicity all things we need [[wish]] for. if [[jupiter]], then, was worshipped in order that he might give these two things,—because, if extent and duration of [[empire]] is something [[good]], it pertains to this same felicity,—why is it not understood that they are not goddesses [[goddess]], but the gifts of [[god]]? but if they are judged to be goddesses [[goddess]], then at least that other [[great]] crowd of gods should not be sought after. for, having considered all the offices which their fancy has distributed among the various gods and goddesses [[goddess]], let them find out, if they can, anything which could be bestowed by any [[god]] whatever on a [[man]] possessing [[virtue]], possessing felicity. what instruction could be sought either from mercury or minerva, when [[virtue]] already possessed all in herself? [[virtue]], indeed, is defined by the ancients as itself the art [[arts]] of living well and rightly. hence, because [[virtue]] is called in [[greek]] ἀρετὴ, it has been [[thought]] the latins have derived from it the term art [[arts]]. but if [[virtue]] cannot come except to the clever, what need was there of the [[god]] [[father]] catius, who should make [[men]] cautious, that is, acute, when felicity could confer this? because, to be born clever belongs to felicity. whence, although [[goddess]] felicity could not be worshipped by one not yet born, in order that, being made his friend, she might bestow this on him, yet she might confer this favour on parents who were her worshippers, that clever [[children]] should be born to them. what need had [[women]] in childbirth to invoke lucina, when, if felicity should be [[present]], they would have, not only a [[good]] delivery, but [[good]] [[children]] too? what need was there to commend the [[children]] to the [[goddess]] ops when they were being born; to the [[god]] vaticanus in their birth-cry; to the [[goddess]] cunina when lying cradled; to the [[goddess]] rumina when sucking; to the [[god]] statilinus when standing; to the [[goddess]] adeona when coming; to abeona when going away; to the [[goddess]] mens [[men]] that they might have a [[good]] [[mind]]; to the [[god]] volumnus, and the [[goddess]] volumna, that they might [[wish]] for [[good]] things; to the nuptial gods, that they might make [[good]] matches; to the[pg 159] rural gods, and chiefly to the [[goddess]] fructesca herself, that they might receive the most abundant fruits; to [[mars]] and bellona, that they might carry on [[war]] well; to the [[goddess]] victoria, that they might be victorious; to the [[god]] [[honor]], that they might be honoured; to the [[goddess]] pecunia, that they might have plenty [[money]]; to the [[god]] aesculanus, and his [[son]] argentinus, that they might have brass and silver coin? for they set down aesculanus as the [[father]] of argentinus for this [[reason]], that brass coin began to be used before silver. but i wonder argentinus has not begotten aurinus, since gold coin also has followed. could they have him for a [[god]], they would prefer aurinus both to his [[father]] argentinus and his grandfather aesculanus, just as they set jove before saturn. therefore, what necessity was there on account of these gifts, either of [[soul]], or [[body]], or outward estate, to [[worship]] and invoke so [[great]] a crowd of gods, all of whom i have not mentioned, nor have they themselves been able to provide for all [[human]] benefits, minutely and singly methodized, minute and [[single]] gods, when the one [[goddess]] felicity was able, with the [[greatest]] ease, compendiously to bestow the whole of them? nor should any other be sought after, either for the bestowing of [[good]] things, or for the averting of [[evil]]. for why should they invoke the [[goddess]] fessonia for the weary; for driving away enemies [[enemy]], the [[goddess]] pellonia; for the sick, as a physician, either [[apollo]] or æsculapius, or both together if there should be [[great]] danger? neither should the [[god]] spiniensis be entreated that he might root out the thorns from the fields; nor the [[goddess]] rubigo that the mildew might not come,—felicitas alone being [[present]] and guarding, either no evils [[evil]] would have arisen, or they would have been quite easily driven away. finally, since we treat of these two goddesses [[goddess]], [[virtue]] and felicity, if felicity is the [[reward]] of [[virtue]], she is not a [[goddess]], but a gift of [[god]]. but if she is a [[goddess]], why may she not be said to confer [[virtue]] itself, inasmuch as it is a [[great]] felicity to attain [[virtue]]?

22. concerning the [[knowledge]] of the [[worship]] due to the gods, which varro glories in having himself conferred on the romans.

what is it, then, that varro boasts he has bestowed as a very [[great]] benefit on his fellow-citizens, because he not only[pg 160] recounts the gods who ought to be worshipped by the romans, but also tells what pertains to each of them? "just as it is of no advantage," he says, "to [[know]] the name and appearance of any [[man]] who is a physician, and not [[know]] that he is a physician, so," he says, "it is of no advantage to [[know]] well that æsculapius is a [[god]], if you are not aware that he can bestow the gift of health, and consequently do not [[know]] why you ought to supplicate him." he also affirms this by another comparison, saying, "no one is able, not only to [[live]] well, but even to [[live]] at all, if he does not [[know]] who is a smith, who a baker, who a weaver, from whom he can seek any utensil, whom he may take for a helper, whom for a leader, whom for a teacher;" asserting, "that in this way it can be doubtful to no one, that thus the [[knowledge]] of the gods is useful, if one can [[know]] what [[force]], and faculty, or [[power]] any [[god]] may have in anything. for from this we may be able," he says, "to [[know]] what [[god]] we ought to call to, and invoke for any cause; lest we should do as too many are wont to do, and [[desire]] water from liber, and wine from lymphs." very useful, forsooth! who would not give this [[man]] thanks if he could show true things, and if he could [[teach]] that the one true [[god]], from whom all [[good]] things are, is to be worshipped by [[men]]?

23. concerning felicity, whom the romans, who venerate many gods, for a long [[time]] did not [[worship]] with [[divine]] [[honour]], though she alone would have sufficed instead of all.

but how does it happen, if their books [[book]] and rituals are true, and felicity is a [[goddess]], that she herself is not appointed as the only one to be worshipped, since she could confer all things, and all at once make [[men]] [[happy]]? for who wishes [[wish]] anything for any other [[reason]] than that he may become [[happy]]? why was it left to lucullus to dedicate a temple to so [[great]] a [[goddess]] at so late a date, and after so many roman rulers? why did romulus himself, ambitious as he was of founding a fortunate [[city]], not erect a temple to this [[goddess]] before all others? why did he supplicate the other gods for anything, since he would have lacked nothing had she been with him? for even he himself would neither have been first a [[king]], then afterwards, as they [[think]], a [[god]], if this [[goddess]] had not been propitious to him. why, therefore, did[pg 161] he appoint as gods for the romans, janus, jove, [[mars]], picus, faunus, tiberinus, hercules, and others, if there were more of them? why did titus tatius add saturn, ops, sun, moon, vulcan, [[light]], and whatever others he added, among whom was even the [[goddess]] cloacina, while felicity was neglected? why did numa appoint so many gods and so many goddesses [[goddess]] without this one? was it perhaps because he could not see her among so [[great]] a crowd? certainly [[king]] hostilius would not have introduced the new gods [[fear]] and dread to be propitiated, if he could have known or might have worshipped this [[goddess]]. for, in presence of felicity, [[fear]] and dread would have disappeared,—i do not say propitiated, but put to flight. next, i ask, how is it that the roman [[empire]] had already immensely increased before any one worshipped felicity? was the [[empire]], therefore, more [[great]] than [[happy]]? for how could true felicity be there, where there was not true piety? for piety is the [[genuine]] [[worship]] of the true [[god]], and not the [[worship]] of as many demons as there are false gods. yet even afterwards, when felicity had already been taken into the number of the gods, the [[great]] infelicity of the civil wars [[war]] ensued. was felicity perhaps justly indignant, both because she was invited so late, and was invited not to [[honour]], but rather to reproach, because along with her were worshipped priapus, and cloacina, and [[fear]] and dread, and ague, and others which were not gods to be worshipped, but the crimes of the worshippers? [[last]] of all, if it seemed [[good]] to [[worship]] so [[great]] a [[goddess]] along with a most unworthy crowd, why at least was she not worshipped in a more honourable way than the rest? for is it not intolerable that felicity is placed neither among the gods consentes,[171] whom they allege to be admitted into the council of [[jupiter]], nor among the gods whom they term select? some temple might be made for her which might be pre-eminent, both in loftiness of site and [[dignity]] of style. why, indeed, not something [[better]] than is made for [[jupiter]] himself? for who gave the [[kingdom]] even to [[jupiter]] but felicity? i am supposing that when he reigned he was [[happy]]. felicity, however, is certainly more valuable than a[pg 162] [[kingdom]]. for no one doubts [[doubt]] that a [[man]] might easily be found who may [[fear]] to be made a [[king]]; but no one is found who is unwilling to be [[happy]]. therefore, if it is [[thought]] they can be consulted by augury, or in any other way, the gods themselves should be consulted about this thing, whether they may [[wish]] to give place to felicity. if, perchance, the place should already be occupied by the temples and altars of others, where a greater and more lofty temple might be built to felicity, even [[jupiter]] himself might give way, so that felicity might rather obtain the very pinnacle of the capitoline hill. for there is not any one who would resist felicity, except, which is impossible, one who might [[wish]] to be unhappy. certainly, if he should be consulted, [[jupiter]] would in no case do what those three gods, [[mars]], terminus, and juventas, did, who positively refused to give place to their superior and [[king]]. for, as their books [[book]] record, when [[king]] tarquin wished to construct the capitol, and perceived that the place which seemed to him to be the most worthy and suitable was preoccupied by other gods, not daring to do anything contrary to their [[pleasure]], and believing that they would willingly give place to a [[god]] who was so [[great]], and was their own master, because there were many of them there when the capitol was founded, he inquired by augury whether they chose to give place to [[jupiter]], and they were all willing to remove thence except those whom i have named, [[mars]], terminus, and juventas; and therefore the capitol was built in such a way that these three also might be within it, yet with such obscure signs that even the most learned [[men]] could scarcely [[know]] this. surely, then, [[jupiter]] himself would by no means despise felicity as he was himself despised by terminus, [[mars]], and juventas. but even they themselves who had not given place to [[jupiter]], would certainly give place to felicity, who had made [[jupiter]] [[king]] over them. or if they should not give place, they would act thus not out of contempt of her, but because they chose rather to be obscure in the house of felicity, than to be eminent without her in their own places.

thus the [[goddess]] felicity being established in the largest and loftiest place, the [[citizens]] should learn whence the furtherance of every [[good]] [[desire]] should be sought. and so, by the persuasion of [[nature]] herself, the superfluous multitude of other[pg 163] gods being abandoned, felicity alone would be worshipped, prayer would be made to her alone, her temple alone would be frequented by the [[citizens]] who wished to be [[happy]], which no one of them would not [[wish]]; and thus felicity, who was sought for from all the gods, would be sought for only from her own [[self]]. for who wishes [[wish]] to receive from any [[god]] anything else than felicity, or what he supposes to tend to felicity? wherefore, if felicity has it in her [[power]] to be with what [[man]] she pleases (and she has it if she is a goddess), what folly is it, after all, to seek from any other [[god]] her whom you can obtain by request from her own self! therefore they ought to [[honour]] this [[goddess]] above other gods, even by [[dignity]] of place. for, as we [[read]] in their own authors, the ancient romans paid greater honours [[honour]] to i [[know]] not what summanus, to whom they attributed nocturnal thunderbolts, than to [[jupiter]], to whom diurnal thunderbolts were held to pertain. but, after a famous and conspicuous temple had been built to [[jupiter]], owing to the [[dignity]] of the building, the multitude resorted to him in so [[great]] numbers, that scarce one can be found who remembers even to have [[read]] the name of summanus, which now he cannot once hear named. but if felicity is not a [[goddess]], because, as is true, it is a gift of [[god]], that [[god]] must be sought who has [[power]] to give it, and that hurtful multitude of false gods must be abandoned which the [[vain]] multitude of foolish [[men]] follows after, making gods to itself of the gifts of [[god]], and offending himself whose gifts they are by the stubbornness of a proud will. for he cannot be [[free]] from infelicity who worships felicity as a [[goddess]], and forsakes [[god]], the giver of felicity; just as he cannot be [[free]] from [[hunger]] who licks a painted loaf of bread, and does not buy it of the [[man]] who has a real one.

24. the reasons [[reason]] by which the pagans attempt to defend their worshipping among the gods the [[divine]] gifts themselves.

we may, however, consider their reasons [[reason]]. is it to be believed, say they, that our forefathers were besotted even to such a [[degree]] as not to [[know]] that these things are [[divine]] gifts, and not gods? but as they knew that such things are granted to no one, except by some [[god]] freely bestowing them, they called the gods whose names they did not find out by the names of those things which they deemed to be given by them;[pg 164] sometimes slightly altering the name for that [[purpose]], as, for [[example]], from [[war]] they have named bellona, not bellum; from cradles, cunina, not cunæ; from standing corn, segetia, not seges; from apples, pomona, not pomum; from oxen, bubona, not bos. sometimes, again, with no alteration of the word, just as the things themselves are named, so that the [[goddess]] who gives [[money]] is called pecunia, and [[money]] is not [[thought]] to be itself a [[goddess]]: so of virtus, who gives [[virtue]]; [[honor]], who gives [[honour]]; concordia, who gives concord; victoria, who gives [[victory]]. so, they say, when felicitas is called a [[goddess]], what is meant is not the thing itself which is given, but that deity by whom felicity is given.

25. concerning the one [[god]] only to be worshipped, who, although his name is unknown, is yet deemed to be the giver of felicity.

having had that [[reason]] rendered to us, we shall perhaps much more easily persuade, as we [[wish]], those whose [[heart]] has not become too much hardened. for if now [[human]] infirmity has perceived that felicity cannot be given except by some [[god]]; if this was perceived by those who worshipped so many gods, at whose head they set [[jupiter]] himself; if, in their ignorance of the name of him by whom felicity was given, they agreed to call him by the name of that very thing which they believed he gave;—then it follows that they [[thought]] that felicity could not be given even by [[jupiter]] himself, whom they already worshipped, but certainly by him whom they [[thought]] fit to [[worship]] under the name of felicity itself. i thoroughly affirm the statement that they believed felicity to be given by a [[certain]] [[god]] whom they knew not: let him therefore be sought after, let him be worshipped, and it is enough. let the train of innumerable demons be repudiated, and let this [[god]] suffice every [[man]] whom his gift suffices. for him, i say, [[god]] the giver of felicity will not be enough to [[worship]], for whom felicity itself is not enough to receive. but let him for whom it suffices (and [[man]] has nothing more he ought to [[wish]] for) serve the one [[god]], the giver of felicity. this [[god]] is not he whom they call [[jupiter]]. for if they acknowledged him to be the giver of felicity, they would not seek, under the name of felicity itself, for another [[god]] or [[goddess]] by whom felicity might be given; nor could they tolerate that[pg 165] [[jupiter]] himself should be worshipped with such infamous attributes. for he is said to be the debaucher of the wives [[wife]] of others; he is the shameless lover and ravisher of a beautiful boy.

26. of the scenic plays, the celebration of which the gods have exacted from their worshippers.

"but," says cicero, "homer [[invented]] these things, and transferred things [[human]] to the gods: i would rather transfer things [[divine]] to us."[172] the poet, by ascribing such crimes to the gods, has justly displeased the grave [[man]]. why, then, are the scenic plays, where these crimes are habitually spoken of, acted, exhibited, in [[honour]] of the gods, reckoned among things [[divine]] by the most learned [[men]]? cicero should exclaim, not against the inventions of the poets, but against the customs of the ancients. would not they have exclaimed in reply, what have we done? the gods themselves have loudly demanded that these plays should be exhibited in their [[honour]], have fiercely exacted them, have menaced destruction unless this was performed, have avenged its neglect with [[great]] severity, and have manifested [[pleasure]] at the reparation of such neglect. among their [[virtuous]] and wonderful deeds the following is related. it was announced in a [[dream]] to titus latinius, a roman rustic, that he should go to the senate and tell them to recommence the games of [[rome]], because on the first day of their celebration a condemned [[criminal]] had been [[led]] to [[punishment]] in sight of the [[people]], an incident so [[sad]] as to disturb the gods who were seeking amusement from the games. and when the peasant who had received this intimation was afraid on the following day to deliver it to the senate, it was renewed next night in a severer form: he lost his [[son]], because of his neglect. on the third night he was warned that a yet graver [[punishment]] was impending, if he should still refuse [[obedience]]. when even thus he did not dare to obey, he fell into a virulent and horrible disease. but then, on the [[advice]] of his [[friends]], he gave information to the magistrates, and was carried in a litter into the senate, and having, on declaring his [[dream]], immediately recovered [[strength]], went away on his own feet whole.[173] the senate, amazed at so [[great]] a miracle, decreed that the[pg 166] games should be renewed at fourfold cost. what sensible [[man]] does not see that [[men]], being put upon by malignant demons, from whose domination nothing save the grace of [[god]] through [[jesus]] [[christ]] our [[lord]] sets [[free]], have been compelled by [[force]] to exhibit to such gods as these, plays which, if well advised, they should condemn as shameful? [[certain]] it is that in these plays the poetic crimes of the gods are celebrated, yet they are plays which were re-established by decree of the senate, under compulsion of the gods. in these plays the most shameless actors celebrated [[jupiter]] as the corrupter of chastity, and thus gave him [[pleasure]]. if that was a fiction, he would have been moved to anger; but if he was delighted with the representation of his crimes, even although fabulous, then, when he happened to be worshipped, who but the [[devil]] could be served? is it so that he could found, extend, and preserve the roman [[empire]], who was more vile than any roman [[man]] whatever, to whom such things were displeasing? could he give felicity who was so infelicitously worshipped, and who, unless he should be thus worshipped, was yet more infelicitously provoked to anger?

27. concerning the three kinds [[kind]] of gods about which the pontiff scævola has discoursed.

it is recorded that the very learned pontiff scævola[174] had distinguished about three kinds [[kind]] of gods—one introduced by the poets, another by the [[philosophers]], another by the statesmen. the first [[kind]] he declares to be trifling, because many unworthy things have been [[invented]] by the poets concerning the gods; the second does not suit states, because it contains some things that are superfluous, and some, too, which it would be prejudicial for the [[people]] to [[know]]. it is no [[great]] matter about the superfluous things, for it is a [[common]] saying of skilful lawyers, "superfluous things do no harm."[175] but what are those things which do harm when brought before the multitude? "these," he says, "that hercules, æsculapius, castor and pollux, are not gods; for it is declared by learned [[men]] that these were but [[men]], and yielded to the common[pg 167] lot of mortals." what else? "that states have not the true images of the gods; because the true [[god]] has neither [[sex]], nor [[age]], nor definite corporeal members." the pontiff is not willing that the [[people]] should [[know]] these things; for he does not [[think]] they are false. he thinks [[think]] it expedient, therefore, that states should be deceived in matters of [[religion]]; which varro himself does not hesitate even to say in his books [[book]] about things [[divine]]. excellent religion! to which the [[weak]], who requires to be delivered, may flee for succour; and when he seeks for the [[truth]] by which he may be delivered, it is believed to be expedient for him that he be deceived. and, truly, in these same books [[book]], scævola is not silent as to his [[reason]] for rejecting the poetic sort of gods,—to wit, "because they so disfigure the gods that they could not bear comparison even with [[good]] [[men]], when they make one to commit theft, another adultery; or, again, to say or do something else basely and foolishly; as that three goddesses [[goddess]] contested (with each other) the prize of [[beauty]], and the two vanquished by [[venus]] destroyed troy; that [[jupiter]] turned himself into a bull or swan that he might copulate with some one; that a [[goddess]] [[married]] a [[man]], and saturn devoured his [[children]]; that, in fine, there is nothing that could be imagined, either of the miraculous or vicious, which may not be found there, and yet is far removed from the [[nature]] of the gods." o [[chief]] pontiff scævola, take away the plays if thou art [[arts]] able; instruct the [[people]] that they may not offer such honours [[honour]] to the [[immortal]] gods, in which, if they like, they may [[admire]] the crimes of the gods, and, so far as it is possible, may, if they please, imitate them. but if the [[people]] shall have answered thee, you, o pontiff, have brought these things in among us, then ask the gods themselves at whose instigation you have ordered these things, that they may not order such things to be offered to them. for if they are [[bad]], and therefore in no way to be believed concerning the majority of the gods, the greater is the [[wrong]] done the gods about whom they are feigned with impunity. but they do not hear thee, they are demons, they [[teach]] wicked things, they rejoice in vile things; not only do they not count it a [[wrong]] if these things are feigned about them, but it is a [[wrong]] they are quite unable to bear if they[pg 168] are not acted at their stated festivals. but now, if thou wouldst call on [[jupiter]] against them, chiefly for that [[reason]] that more of his crimes are wont to be acted in the scenic plays, is it not the case that, although you call him [[god]] [[jupiter]], by whom this whole [[world]] is ruled and administered, it is he to whom the [[greatest]] [[wrong]] is done by you, because you have [[thought]] he ought to be worshipped along with them, and have styled him their [[king]]?

28. whether the [[worship]] of the gods has been of service to the romans in obtaining and extending the [[empire]].

therefore such gods, who are propitiated by such honours [[honour]], or rather are impeached by them (for it is a greater crime to delight in having such things said of them falsely, than even if they could be said truly), could never by any means have been able to increase and preserve the roman [[empire]]. for if they could have done it, they would rather have bestowed so grand a gift on the greeks [[greek]], who, in this [[kind]] of [[divine]] things,—that is, in scenic plays,—have worshipped them more honourably and worthily, although they have not exempted themselves from those slanders of the poets, by whom they saw the gods torn in pieces, giving them licence to ill-use any [[man]] they pleased, and have not deemed the scenic players themselves to be base, but have held them worthy even of distinguished [[honour]]. but just as the romans were able to have gold [[money]], although they did not [[worship]] a [[god]] aurinus, so also they could have silver and brass coin, and yet [[worship]] neither argentinus nor his [[father]] æsculanus; and so of all the rest, which it would be irksome for me to detail. it follows, therefore, both that they could not by any means attain such dominion if the true [[god]] was unwilling; and that if these gods, false and many, were unknown or contemned, and he alone was known and worshipped with sincere [[faith]] and [[virtue]], they would both have a [[better]] [[kingdom]] here, whatever might be its extent, and whether they might have one here or not, would afterwards receive an eternal [[kingdom]].

29. of the falsity of the augury by which the [[strength]] and stability of the roman [[empire]] was considered to be indicated.

for what [[kind]] of augury is that which they have declared to be most beautiful, and to which i referred a little ago, that[pg 169] [[mars]], and terminus, and juventas would not give place even to jove the [[king]] of the gods? for thus, they say, it was signified that the nation dedicated to [[mars]],—that is, the roman,—should yield to none the place it once occupied; likewise, that on account of the [[god]] terminus, no one would be able to disturb the roman frontiers; and also, that the roman [[youth]], because of the [[goddess]] juventas, should yield to no one. let them see, therefore, how they can hold him to be the [[king]] of their gods, and the giver of their own [[kingdom]], if these auguries set him down for an adversary, to whom it would have been honourable not to yield. however, if these things are true, they need not be at all afraid. for they are not going to confess that the gods who would not yield to jove have yielded to [[christ]]. for, without altering the boundaries of the [[empire]], [[jesus]] [[christ]] has proved himself able to drive them, not only from their temples, but from the hearts [[heart]] of their worshippers. but, before [[christ]] came in the flesh, and, indeed, before these things which we have quoted from their books [[book]] could have been written, but yet after that auspice was made under [[king]] tarquin, the roman [[army]] has been divers times [[time]] scattered or put to flight, and has shown the falseness of the auspice, which they derived from the [[fact]] that the [[goddess]] juventas had not given place to jove; and the nation dedicated to [[mars]] was trodden down in the [[city]] itself by the invading and triumphant gauls; and the boundaries of the [[empire]], through the falling away of many cities [[city]] to hannibal, had been hemmed into a narrow space. thus the [[beauty]] of the auspices is made void, and there has remained only the contumacy against jove, not of gods, but of demons. for it is one thing not to have yielded, and another to have returned whither you have yielded. besides, even afterwards, in the oriental regions, the boundaries of the roman [[empire]] were changed by the will of hadrian; for he yielded up to the persian [[empire]] those three [[noble]] provinces, armenia, mesopotamia, and assyria. thus that [[god]] terminus, who according to these books [[book]] was the guardian of the roman frontiers, and by that most beautiful auspice had not given place to jove, would seem to have been more afraid of hadrian, a [[king]] of [[men]], than of the [[king]] of the gods. the aforesaid[pg 170] provinces having also been taken back again, almost within our own recollection the frontier fell back, when julian, given up to the oracles of their gods, with immoderate daring ordered the victualling ships to be set on [[fire]]. the [[army]] being thus left destitute of provisions, and he himself also being presently killed by the [[enemy]], and the legions being hard pressed, while dismayed by the loss of their commander, they were reduced to such extremities that no one could have escaped, unless by articles of [[peace]] the boundaries of the [[empire]] had then been established where they still remain; not, indeed, with so [[great]] a loss as was [[suffered]] by the concession of hadrian, but still at a considerable [[sacrifice]]. it was a [[vain]] augury, then, that the [[god]] terminus did not yield to jove, since he yielded to the will of hadrian, and yielded also to the rashness of julian, and the necessity of jovinian. the more [[intelligent]] and grave romans have seen these things, but have had little [[power]] against the custom of the [[state]], which was bound to observe the rites of the demons; because even they themselves, although they perceived that these things were [[vain]], yet [[thought]] that the [[religious]] [[worship]] which is due to [[god]] should be paid to the [[nature]] of things which is established under the [[rule]] and [[government]] of the one true [[god]], "serving," as saith the apostle, "the creature more than the creator, who is blessed for evermore."[176] the [[help]] of this true [[god]] was necessary to send holy and truly pious [[men]], who would [[die]] for the true [[religion]] that they might remove the false from among the living.

30. what [[kind]] of things even their worshippers have owned they have [[thought]] about the gods of the nations.

cicero the augur laughs at auguries, and reproves [[men]] for regulating the purposes [[purpose]] of [[life]] by the cries of crows and jackdaws.[177] but it will be said that an academic philosopher, who argues that all things are uncertain, is unworthy to have any [[authority]] in these matters. in the second [[book]] of his de natura deorum,[178] he introduces lucilius balbus, who, after showing that superstitions have their origin in physical and philosophical truths [[truth]], expresses his indignation at the setting up[pg 171] of images and fabulous notions, speaking thus: "do you not therefore see that from true and useful physical discoveries the [[reason]] may be drawn away to fabulous and imaginary gods? this gives birth to false opinions [[opinion]] and turbulent errors, and superstitions well-nigh old-wifeish. for both the forms of the gods, and their ages [[age]], and clothing, and ornaments, are made familiar to us; their genealogies, too, their marriages [[marriage]], kinships, and all things about them, are debased to the likeness of [[human]] weakness. they are even introduced as having perturbed minds [[mind]]; for we have accounts of the lusts, cares [[care]], and angers of the gods. nor, indeed, as the fables go, have the gods been without their wars [[war]] and battles [[battle]]. and that not only when, as in [[homer]], some gods on either side have defended two opposing armies [[army]], but they have even carried on wars [[war]] on their own account, as with the titans or with the giants. such things it is quite absurd either to say or to [[believe]]: they are utterly frivolous and groundless." behold, now, what is confessed by those who defend the gods of the nations. afterwards he goes on to say that some things belong to superstition, but others to [[religion]], which he thinks [[think]] [[good]] to [[teach]] according to the stoics. "for not only the [[philosophers]]," he says, "but also our forefathers, have made a distinction between superstition and [[religion]]. for those," he says, "who spent whole days in prayer, and offered [[sacrifice]], that their [[children]] might outlive them, are called [[superstitious]]."[179] who does not see that he is trying, while he fears [[fear]] the [[public]] prejudice, to [[praise]] the [[religion]] of the ancients, and that he wishes [[wish]] to disjoin it from superstition, but cannot find out how to do so? for if those who prayed and sacrificed all day were called [[superstitious]] by the ancients, were those also called so who instituted (what he blames) the images of the gods of diverse [[age]] and distinct clothing, and [[invented]] the genealogies of gods, their marriages [[marriage]], and kinships? when, therefore, these things are found [[fault]] with as [[superstitious]], he implicates in that [[fault]] the ancients who instituted and worshipped such images. nay, he implicates himself, who, with whatever eloquence he may strive to extricate himself[pg 172] and be [[free]], was yet under the necessity of venerating these images; nor dared he so much as whisper in a discourse to the [[people]] what in this disputation he plainly sounds forth. let us christians [[christian]], therefore, give thanks to the [[lord]] our [[god]],—not to [[heaven]] and [[earth]], as that author argues, but to him who has made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; because these superstitions, which that balbus, like a babbler,[180] scarcely reprehends, he, by the most deep lowliness of [[christ]], by the preaching of the [[apostles]], by the [[faith]] of the martyrs dying for the [[truth]] and living with the [[truth]], has overthrown, not only in the hearts [[heart]] of the [[religious]], but even in the temples of the [[superstitious]], by their own [[free]] service.

31. concerning the opinions [[opinion]] of varro, who, while reprobating the popular [[belief]], [[thought]] that their [[worship]] should be confined to one [[god]], though he was unable to discover the true [[god]].

what says varro himself, whom we grieve to have found, although not by his own [[judgment]], placing the scenic plays among things [[divine]]? when in many passages he is exhorting, like a [[religious]] [[man]], to the [[worship]] of the gods, does he not in doing so admit that he does not in his own [[judgment]] [[believe]] those things which he relates that the roman [[state]] has instituted; so that he does not hesitate to affirm that if he were founding a new [[state]], he could enumerate the gods and their names [[better]] by the [[rule]] of [[nature]]? but being born into a nation already ancient, he says that he finds himself bound to accept the traditional names and surnames of the gods, and the histories [[history]] connected with them, and that his [[purpose]] in investigating and publishing these details is to incline the [[people]] to [[worship]] the gods, and not to despise them. by which words this most acute [[man]] sufficiently indicates that he does not publish all things, because they would not only have been contemptible to himself, but would have seemed despicable even to the rabble, unless they had been passed over in [[silence]]. i should be [[thought]] to conjecture these things, unless he himself, in another passage, had openly said, in speaking of [[religious]] rites, that many things are true which it is not only not useful for the [[common]] [[people]] to [[know]], but that it is expedient that the [[people]] should think[pg 173] otherwise, even though falsely, and therefore the greeks [[greek]] have shut up the [[religious]] ceremonies [[ceremony]] and mysteries in [[silence]], and within walls. in this he no [[doubt]] expresses the policy of the so-called [[wise]] [[men]] by whom states and peoples [[people]] are ruled. yet by this crafty device the malign demons are wonderfully delighted, who possess alike the deceivers and the deceived, and from whose [[tyranny]] nothing sets [[free]] save the grace of [[god]] through [[jesus]] [[christ]] our [[lord]].

the same most acute and learned author also says, that those alone seem to him to have perceived what [[god]] is, who have believed him to be the [[soul]] of the [[world]], governing it by design and [[reason]].[181] and by this, it appears, that although he did not attain to the [[truth]],—for the true [[god]] is not a [[soul]], but the maker and author of the [[soul]],—yet if he could have been [[free]] to go against the prejudices of custom, he could have confessed and counselled others that the one [[god]] ought to be worshipped, who governs the [[world]] by design and [[reason]]; so that on this [[subject]] only this point would remain to be debated with him, that he had called him a [[soul]], and not rather the creator of the [[soul]]. he says, also, that the ancient romans, for more than a hundred and seventy years, worshipped the gods without an image.[182] "and if this custom," he says, "could have remained till now, the gods would have been more purely worshipped." in favour of this [[opinion]], he cites as a witness among others the jewish nation; nor does he hesitate to conclude that passage by saying of those who first consecrated images for the [[people]], that they have both taken away [[religious]] [[fear]] from their fellow-citizens, and increased error, wisely thinking that the gods easily fall into contempt when exhibited under the stolidity of images. but as he does not say they have transmitted error, but that they have increased it, he therefore wishes [[wish]] it to be understood that there was error already when there were no images. wherefore, when he says they alone have perceived what [[god]] is who have believed him to be the governing [[soul]] of the [[world]], and thinks [[think]] that the rites of [[religion]] would have been more purely observed without images, who fails to see how near he has come to the [[truth]]?[pg 174] for if he had been able to do anything against so inveterate an error, he would certainly have given it as his [[opinion]] both that the one [[god]] should be worshipped, and that he should be worshipped without an image; and having so nearly discovered the [[truth]], perhaps he might easily have been put in [[mind]] of the mutability of the [[soul]], and might thus have perceived that the true [[god]] is that immutable [[nature]] which made the [[soul]] itself. since these things are so, whatever ridicule such [[men]] have poured in their writings against the plurality of the gods, they have done so rather as compelled by the secret will of [[god]] to confess them, than as trying to persuade others. if, therefore, any testimonies are adduced by us from these writings, they are adduced for the confutation of those who are unwilling to consider from how [[great]] and malignant a [[power]] of the demons the singular [[sacrifice]] of the shedding of the most holy [[blood]], and the gift of the imparted spirit, can set us [[free]].

32. in what interest the princes [[prince]] of the nations wished false religions [[religion]] to continue among the [[people]] [[subject]] to them.

varro says also, concerning the generations [[generation]] of the gods, that the [[people]] have inclined to the poets rather than to the [[natural]] [[philosophers]]; and that therefore their forefathers,—that is, the ancient romans,—believed both in the [[sex]] and the generations [[generation]] of the gods, and settled their marriages [[marriage]]; which certainly seems to have been done for no other cause except that it was the [[business]] of such [[men]] as were prudent and [[wise]] to [[deceive]] the [[people]] in matters of [[religion]], and in that very thing not only to [[worship]], but also to imitate the demons, whose [[greatest]] [[lust]] is to [[deceive]]. for just as the demons cannot possess any but those whom they have deceived with guile, so also [[men]] in princely office, not indeed being just, but like demons, have persuaded the [[people]] in the name of [[religion]] to receive as true those things which they themselves knew to be false; in this way, as it were, binding them up more firmly in civil [[society]], so that they might in like manner possess them as subjects [[subject]]. but who that was [[weak]] and unlearned could escape the deceits of both the princes [[prince]] of the [[state]] and the demons?

[pg 175]

33. that the times [[time]] of all kings [[king]] and kingdoms [[kingdom]] are ordained by the [[judgment]] and [[power]] of the true [[god]].

therefore that [[god]], the author and giver of felicity, because he alone is the true [[god]], himself gives earthly kingdoms [[kingdom]] both to [[good]] and [[bad]]. neither does he do this rashly, and, as it were, fortuitously,—because he is [[god]], not [[fortune]],—but according to the order of things and times [[time]], which is hidden from us, but thoroughly known to himself; which same order of times [[time]], however, he does not serve as [[subject]] to it, but himself rules [[rule]] as [[lord]] and appoints as governor. felicity he gives only to the [[good]]. whether a [[man]] be a [[subject]] or a [[king]] makes no difference: he may equally either possess or not possess it. and it shall be full in that [[life]] where kings [[king]] and subjects [[subject]] [[exist]] no longer. and therefore earthly kingdoms [[kingdom]] are given by him both to the [[good]] and the [[bad]]; lest his worshippers, still under the conduct of a very [[weak]] [[mind]], should covet these gifts from him as some [[great]] things. and this is the mystery of the old testament, in which the new was hidden, that there even earthly gifts are promised: those who were [[spiritual]] understanding even then, although not yet openly declaring, both the eternity which was symbolized by these earthly things, and in what gifts of [[god]] true felicity could be found.

34. concerning the [[kingdom]] of the [[jews]], which was founded by the one and true [[god]], and preserved by him as long as they remained in the true [[religion]].

therefore, that it might be known that these earthly [[good]] things, after which those pant who cannot imagine [[better]] things, remain in the [[power]] of the one [[god]] himself, not of the many false gods whom the romans have formerly believed worthy of [[worship]], he multiplied his [[people]] in [[egypt]] from being very few, and delivered them out of it by wonderful signs. nor did their [[women]] invoke lucina when their offspring was being incredibly multiplied; and that nation having increased incredibly, he himself delivered, he himself saved them from the hands of the [[egyptians]], who persecuted them, and wished to kill all their infants. without the [[goddess]] rumina they sucked; without cunina they were cradled; without educa and potina they took food and drink; without all those puerile gods they were educated; without the nuptial[pg 176] gods they were [[married]]; without the [[worship]] of priapus they had conjugal intercourse; without invocation of [[neptune]] the divided sea opened up a way for them to pass over, and overwhelmed with its returning waves their enemies [[enemy]] who pursued them. neither did they consecrate any [[goddess]] mannia when they received manna from [[heaven]]; nor, when the smitten rock poured forth water to them when they thirsted, did they [[worship]] nymphs [[nymph]] and lymphs. without the mad rites of [[mars]] and bellona they carried on [[war]]; and while, indeed, they did not conquer without [[victory]], yet they did not hold it to be a [[goddess]], but the gift of their [[god]]. without segetia they had harvests; without bubona, oxen; honey without mellona; apples without pomona: and, in a word, everything for which the romans [[thought]] they must supplicate so [[great]] a crowd of false gods, they received much more happily from the one true [[god]]. and if they had not sinned against him with impious curiosity, which seduced them like magic [[arts]], and drew them to [[strange]] gods and idols, and at [[last]] [[led]] them to kill [[christ]], their [[kingdom]] would have remained to them, and would have been, if not more spacious, yet more [[happy]], than that of [[rome]]. and now that they are dispersed through almost all lands [[land]] and nations, it is through the providence of that one true [[god]]; that whereas the images, altars, groves, and temples of the false gods are everywhere overthrown, and their sacrifices [[sacrifice]] prohibited, it may be shown from their books [[book]] how this has been foretold by their prophets [[prophet]] so long before; lest, perhaps, when they should be [[read]] in ours, they might seem to be [[invented]] by us. but now, reserving what is to [[follow]] for the following [[book]], we must here set a bound to the prolixity of this one.

[pg 177]

book fifth.[183]

argument.

augustine first discusses the doctrine of [[fate]], for the sake of confuting those who are disposed to refer to [[fate]] the [[power]] and increase of the roman [[empire]], which could not be attributed to false gods, as has been shown in the preceding [[book]]. after that, he proves that there is no contradiction between god's prescience and our [[free]] will. he then speaks of the manners of the ancient romans, and shows in what sense it was due to the [[virtue]] of the romans themselves, and in how far to the counsel of [[god]], that he increased their dominion, though they did not [[worship]] him. finally, he explains what is to be accounted the true [[happiness]] of the [[christian]] emperors [[emperor]].

preface.

since, then, it is established that the complete attainment of all we [[desire]] is that which constitutes felicity, which is no [[goddess]], but a gift of [[god]], and that therefore [[men]] can [[worship]] no [[god]] save him who is able to make them [[happy]],—and were felicity herself a [[goddess]], she would with [[reason]] be the only object of [[worship]],—since, i say, this is established, let us now go on to consider why [[god]], who is able to give with all other things those [[good]] gifts which can be possessed by [[men]] who are not [[good]], and consequently not [[happy]], has seen fit to grant such extended and long-continued dominion to the roman [[empire]]; for that this was not effected by that multitude of false gods which they worshipped, we have both already adduced, and shall, as [[occasion]] offers, yet adduce considerable proof.

1. that the cause of the roman [[empire]], and of all kingdoms [[kingdom]], is neither fortuitous nor consists in the position of the stars.[184]

the cause, then, of the greatness of the roman [[empire]] is neither fortuitous nor fatal, according to the [[judgment]] or[pg 178] [[opinion]] of those who call those things fortuitous which either have no causes, or such causes as do not proceed from some intelligible order, and those things fatal which happen independently of the will of [[god]] and [[man]], by the necessity of a [[certain]] order. in a word, [[human]] kingdoms [[kingdom]] are established by [[divine]] providence. and if any one attributes their existence to [[fate]], because he calls the will or the [[power]] of [[god]] itself by the name of [[fate]], let him keep his [[opinion]], but [[correct]] his [[language]]. for why does he not say at first what he will say afterwards, when some one shall put the [[question]] to him, what he means by [[fate]]? for when [[men]] hear that word, according to the ordinary use of the [[language]], they simply [[understand]] by it the [[virtue]] of that particular position of the stars which may [[exist]] at the [[time]] when any one is born or conceived, which some separate altogether from the will of [[god]], whilst others affirm that this also is dependent on that will. but those who are of [[opinion]] that, apart from the will of [[god]], the stars determine what we shall do, or what [[good]] things we shall possess, or what evils [[evil]] we shall suffer, must be refused a hearing by all, not only by those who hold the true [[religion]], but by those who [[wish]] to be the worshippers of any gods whatsoever, even false gods. for what does this [[opinion]] really amount to but this, that no [[god]] whatever is to be worshipped or prayed to? against these, however, our [[present]] disputation is not intended to be directed, but against those who, in defence of those whom they [[think]] to be gods, oppose the [[christian]] [[religion]]. they, however, who make the position of the stars depend on the [[divine]] will, and in a manner decree what [[character]] each [[man]] shall have, and what [[good]] or [[evil]] shall happen to him, if they [[think]] that these same stars have that [[power]] conferred upon them by the supreme [[power]] of [[god]], in order that they may determine these things according to their will, do a [[great]] injury to the celestial sphere, in whose most brilliant senate, and most splendid senate-house, as it were, they suppose that wicked deeds are decreed to be done,—such deeds as that if any terrestrial [[state]] should decree them, it would be condemned to overthrow by the decree of the whole [[human]] [[race]]. what [[judgment]], then, is left to [[god]] concerning the deeds of [[men]], who is [[lord]] both of the stars and of [[men]], when to these deeds[pg 179] a celestial necessity is attributed? or, if they do not say that the stars, though they have indeed received a [[certain]] [[power]] from [[god]], who is supreme, determine those things according to their own discretion, but simply that his commands are fulfilled by them instrumentally in the application and enforcing of such necessities, are we thus to [[think]] concerning [[god]] even what it seemed unworthy that we should [[think]] concerning the will of the stars? but, if the stars are said rather to signify these things than to effect them, so that that position of the stars is, as it were, a [[kind]] of [[speech]] predicting, not causing future things,—for this has been the [[opinion]] of [[men]] of no ordinary learning,—certainly the mathematicians are not wont so to speak, saying, for [[example]], [[mars]] in such or such a position signifies a homicide, but makes a homicide. but, nevertheless, though we grant that they do not speak as they ought, and that we ought to accept as the proper form of [[speech]] that employed by the [[philosophers]] in predicting those things which they [[think]] they discover in the position of the stars, how comes it that they have never been able to assign any cause why, in the [[life]] of twins, in their actions, in the events which befall them, in their professions, [[arts]], honours [[honour]], and other things pertaining to [[human]] [[life]], also in their very [[death]], there is often so [[great]] a difference, that, as far as these things are concerned, many entire strangers are more like them than they are like each other, though separated at birth by the smallest interval of [[time]], but at conception generated by the same act of copulation, and at the same moment?

cicero says that the famous physician hippocrates has left in writing that he had suspected that a [[certain]] pair of brothers [[brother]] were twins, from the [[fact]] that they both took ill at once, and their disease advanced to its crisis and subsided in the same [[time]] in each of them.[185] posidonius the stoic, who was much given to astrology, used to explain the [[fact]] by supposing that they had been born and conceived under the same constellation. in this [[question]] the conjecture of the physician is by[pg 180] far more worthy to be accepted, and approaches much nearer to credibility, since, according as the parents were affected in [[body]] at the [[time]] of copulation, so might the first elements of the fœtuses have been affected, so that all that was necessary for their [[growth]] and [[development]] up till birth having been supplied from the [[body]] of the same [[mother]], they might be born with like constitutions [[constitution]]. thereafter, nourished in the same house, on the same kinds [[kind]] of food, where they would have also the same kinds [[kind]] of air, the same locality, the same quality of water,—which, according to the testimony of medical [[science]], have a very [[great]] influence, [[good]] or [[bad]], on the condition of bodily health,—and where they would also be accustomed to the same kinds [[kind]] of exercise, they would have bodily constitutions [[constitution]] so similar that they would be similarly affected with sickness at the same [[time]] and by the same causes. but, to [[wish]] to adduce that particular position of the stars which existed at the [[time]] when they were born or conceived as the cause of their being simultaneously affected with sickness, manifests the [[greatest]] arrogance, when so many beings of most diverse kinds [[kind]], in the most diverse conditions, and [[subject]] to the most diverse events, may have been conceived and born at the same [[time]], and in the same district, lying under the same [[sky]]. but we [[know]] that twins do not only act differently, and travel to very different places, but that they also suffer from different kinds [[kind]] of sickness; for which hippocrates would give what is in my [[opinion]] the simplest [[reason]], namely, that, through [[diversity]] of food and exercise, which arises not from the [[constitution]] of the [[body]], but from the inclination of the [[mind]], they may have come to be different from each other in [[respect]] of health. moreover, posidonius, or any other asserter of the fatal influence of the stars, will have enough to do to find anything to say to this, if he be unwilling to impose upon the minds [[mind]] of the uninstructed in things of which they are ignorant. but, as to what they attempt to make out from that very small interval of [[time]] elapsing between the births of twins, on account of that point in the heavens [[heaven]] where the mark of the natal hour is placed, and which they call the "horoscope," it is either disproportionately small to the [[diversity]] which is found in the dispositions, actions, habits, and fortunes [[fortune]] of twins,[pg 181] or it is disproportionately [[great]] when compared with the estate of twins, whether low or high, which is the same for both of them, the cause for whose [[greatest]] difference they place, in every case, in the hour on which one is born; and, for this [[reason]], if the one is born so immediately after the other that there is no [[change]] in the horoscope, i demand an entire similarity in all that respects [[respect]] them both, which can never be found in the case of any twins. but if the slowness of the birth of the second give [[time]] for a [[change]] in the horoscope, i demand different parents, which twins can never have.

3. concerning the arguments which nigidius the mathematician drew from the potter's wheel, in the [[question]] about the birth of twins.

it is to no [[purpose]], therefore, that that famous fiction about the potter's wheel is brought forward, which tells of the [[answer]] which nigidius is said to have given when he was perplexed with this [[question]], and on account of which he was called figulus.[186] for, having whirled round the potter's wheel with all his [[strength]], he marked it with ink, striking it twice with the utmost rapidity, so that the strokes seemed to fall on the very same part of it. then, when the rotation had ceased, the marks which he had made were found upon the rim of the wheel at no small distance apart. thus, said he, considering the [[great]] rapidity with which the celestial sphere revolves, even though twins were born with as short an interval between their births as there was between the strokes which i gave this wheel, that brief interval of [[time]] is equivalent to a very [[great]] distance in the celestial sphere. hence, said he, come whatever dissimilitudes may be remarked in the habits and fortunes [[fortune]] of twins. this argument is more fragile than the vessels which are fashioned by the rotation of that wheel. for if there is so much significance in the heavens [[heaven]] which cannot be comprehended by observation of the constellations, that, in the case of twins, an [[inheritance]] may fall to the one and not to the other, why, in the case of others who are not twins, do they dare, having examined their constellations, to declare such things as pertain to that secret which no one can comprehend, and to attribute them to the precise moment of the birth of each [[individual]]? now, if such predictions in connection with the[pg 182] natal hours of others who are not twins are to be vindicated on the ground that they are founded on the observation of more extended spaces in the heavens [[heaven]], whilst those very small moments of [[time]] which separated the births of twins, and correspond to minute portions of celestial space, are to be connected with trifling things about which the mathematicians are not wont to be consulted,—for who would consult them as to when he is to sit, when to walk abroad, when and on what he is to dine?—how can we be justified in so speaking, when we can point out such manifold [[diversity]] both in the habits, doings, and destinies of twins?

4. concerning the twins esau and jacob, who were very unlike each other both in their [[character]] and actions.

in the [[time]] of the ancient fathers [[father]], to speak concerning illustrious persons [[person]], there were born two twin brothers [[brother]], the one so immediately after the other, that the first took hold of the heel of the second. so [[great]] a difference existed in their lives [[life]] and manners, so [[great]] a dissimilarity in their actions, so [[great]] a difference in their parents' [[love]] for them respectively, that the very contrast between them produced even a mutual hostile antipathy. do we mean, when we say that they were so unlike each other, that when the one was walking the other was sitting, when the one was sleeping the other was waking,—which differences are such as are attributed to those minute portions of space which cannot be appreciated by those who note down the position of the stars which exists at the moment of one's birth, in order that the mathematicians may be consulted concerning it? one of these twins was for a long [[time]] a hired servant; the other never served. one of them was beloved by his [[mother]]; the other was not so. one of them lost that [[honour]] which was so much valued among their [[people]]; the other obtained it. and what shall we say of their wives [[wife]], their [[children]], and their possessions? how different they were in [[respect]] to all these! if, therefore, such things as these are connected with those minute intervals of [[time]] which elapse between the births of twins, and are not to be attributed to the constellations, wherefore are they predicted in the case of others from the examination of their constellations? and if, on the other hand, these things are said to be[pg 183] predicted, because they are connected, not with minute and inappreciable moments, but with intervals of [[time]] which can be observed and noted down, what [[purpose]] is that potter's wheel to serve in this matter, except it be to whirl round [[men]] who have hearts [[heart]] of clay, in order that they may be prevented from detecting the emptiness of the talk of the mathematicians?

5. in what manner the mathematicians are convicted of professing a [[vain]] [[science]].

do not those very persons [[person]] whom the medical sagacity of hippocrates [[led]] him to suspect to be twins, because their disease was observed by him to develope to its crisis and to subside again in the same [[time]] in each of them,—do not these, i say, serve as a sufficient refutation of those who [[wish]] to attribute to the influence of the stars that which was owing to a similarity of bodily [[constitution]]? for wherefore were they both sick of the same disease, and at the same [[time]], and not the one after the other in the order of their birth? (for certainly they could not both be born at the same [[time]].) or, if the [[fact]] of their having been born at different times [[time]] by no means necessarily implies that they must be sick at different times [[time]], why do they contend that the difference in the [[time]] of their births was the cause of their difference in other things? why could they travel in [[foreign]] parts at different times [[time]], [[marry]] at different times [[time]], beget [[children]] at different times [[time]], and do many other things at different times [[time]], by [[reason]] of their having been born at different times [[time]], and yet could not, for the same [[reason]], also be sick at different times [[time]]? for if a difference in the moment of birth changed the horoscope, and occasioned dissimilarity in all other things, why has that simultaneousness which belonged to their conception remained in their attacks of sickness? or, if the destinies of health are involved in the [[time]] of conception, but those of other things be said to be attached to the [[time]] of birth, they ought not to predict anything concerning health from examination of the constellations of birth, when the hour of conception is not also given, that its constellations may be inspected. but if they say that they predict attacks of sickness without examining the horoscope of conception, because these are indicated by the moments of birth, how could they inform either[pg 184] of these twins when he would be sick, from the horoscope of his birth, when the other also, who had not the same horoscope of birth, must of necessity fall sick at the same [[time]]? again, i ask, if the distance of [[time]] between the births of twins is so [[great]] as to [[occasion]] a difference of their constellations on account of the difference of their horoscopes, and therefore of all the cardinal points to which so much influence is attributed, that even from such [[change]] there comes a difference of [[destiny]], how is it possible that this should be so, since they cannot have been conceived at different times [[time]]? or, if two conceived at the same moment of [[time]] could have different destinies with [[respect]] to their births, why may not also two born at the same moment of [[time]] have different destinies for [[life]] and for [[death]]? for if the one moment in which both were conceived did not hinder that the one should be born before the other, why, if two are born at the same moment, should anything hinder them from dying at the same moment? if a simultaneous conception allows of twins being differently affected in the womb, why should not simultaneousness of birth allow of any two individuals [[individual]] having different fortunes [[fortune]] in the [[world]]? and thus would all the fictions of this art [[arts]], or rather delusion, be swept away. what [[strange]] circumstance is this, that two [[children]] conceived at the same [[time]], nay, at the same moment, under the same position of the stars, have different fates [[fate]] which bring them to different hours of birth, whilst two [[children]], born of two different mothers [[mother]], at the same moment of [[time]], under one and the same position of the stars, cannot have different fates [[fate]] which shall conduct them by necessity to diverse manners of [[life]] and of [[death]]? are they at conception as yet without destinies, because they can only have them if they be born? what, therefore, do they mean when they say that, if the hour of the conception be found, many things can be predicted by these astrologers? from which also arose that story which is reiterated by some, that a [[certain]] sage chose an hour in which to [[lie]] with his [[wife]], in order to secure his begetting an illustrious [[son]]. from this [[opinion]] also came that [[answer]] of posidonius, the [[great]] astrologer and also philosopher, concerning those twins who were attacked with sickness at the same [[time]], namely, "that this[pg 185] had happened to them because they were conceived at the same [[time]], and born at the same [[time]]." for certainly he added "conception," lest it should be said to him that they could not both be born at the same [[time]], knowing that at any rate they must both have been conceived at the same [[time]]; wishing thus to show that he did not attribute the [[fact]] of their being similarly and simultaneously affected with sickness to the similarity of their bodily constitutions [[constitution]] as its proximate cause, but that he held that even in [[respect]] of the similarity of their health, they were bound together by a sidereal connection. if, therefore, the [[time]] of conception has so much to do with the similarity of destinies, these same destinies ought not to be changed by the circumstances of birth; or, if the destinies of twins be said to be changed because they are born at different times [[time]], why should we not rather [[understand]] that they had been already changed in order that they might be born at different times [[time]]? does not, then, the will of [[men]] living in the [[world]] [[change]] the destinies of birth, when the order of birth can [[change]] the destinies they had at conception?

6. concerning twins of different sexes [[sex]].

but even in the very conception of twins, which certainly occurs at the same moment in the case of both, it often happens that the one is conceived a male, and the other a female. i [[know]] two of different sexes [[sex]] who are twins. both of them are alive, and in the flower of their [[age]]; and though they resemble each other in [[body]], as far as difference of [[sex]] will permit, still they are very different in the whole scope and [[purpose]] of their lives [[life]] (consideration being had of those differences which necessarily [[exist]] between the lives [[life]] of males and females),—the one holding the office of a count, and being almost constantly away from [[home]] with the [[army]] in [[foreign]] service, the other never leaving her country's soil, or her native district. still more,—and this is more incredible, if the destinies of the stars are to be believed in, though it is not wonderful if we consider the wills of [[men]], and the [[free]] gifts of [[god]],—he is [[married]]; she is a [[sacred]] virgin: he has begotten a numerous offspring; she has never even [[married]]. but is not the [[virtue]] of the horoscope very [[great]]? i [[think]] i have said enough to show the absurdity of that. but, say those[pg 186] astrologers, whatever be the [[virtue]] of the horoscope in other respects [[respect]], it is certainly of significance with [[respect]] to birth. but why not also with [[respect]] to conception, which takes place undoubtedly with one act of copulation? and, indeed, so [[great]] is the [[force]] of [[nature]], that after a woman has once conceived, she ceases to be liable to conception. or were they, perhaps, changed at birth, either he into a male, or she into a female, because of the difference in their horoscopes? but, whilst it is not altogether absurd to say that [[certain]] sidereal influences have some [[power]] to cause differences in bodies [[body]] alone,—as, for instance, we see that the seasons of the year come round by the approaching and receding of the sun, and that [[certain]] kinds [[kind]] of things are increased in size or diminished by the waxings and wanings of the moon, such as sea-urchins, oysters, and the wonderful tides of the ocean,—it does not [[follow]] that the wills of [[men]] are to be made [[subject]] to the position of the stars. the astrologers, however, when they [[wish]] to bind our actions also to the constellations, only set us on investigating whether, even in these bodies [[body]], the changes [[change]] may not be attributable to some other than a sidereal cause. for what is there which more intimately concerns a [[body]] than its [[sex]]? and yet, under the same position of the stars, twins of different sexes [[sex]] may be conceived. wherefore, what greater absurdity can be affirmed or believed than that the position of the stars, which was the same for both of them at the [[time]] of conception, could not cause that the one child should not have been of a different [[sex]] from her [[brother]], with whom she had a [[common]] constellation, whilst the position of the stars which existed at the hour of their birth could cause that she should be separated from him by the [[great]] distance between [[marriage]] and holy virginity?

7. concerning the choosing of a day for [[marriage]], or for planting, or sowing.

now, will any one bring forward this, that in choosing [[certain]] particular days for particular actions, [[men]] bring about [[certain]] new destinies for their actions? that [[man]], for instance, according to this doctrine, was not born to have an illustrious [[son]], but rather a contemptible one, and therefore, being a [[man]] of learning, he chose an hour in which to [[lie]] with his [[wife]].[pg 187] he made, therefore, a [[destiny]] which he did not have before, and from that [[destiny]] of his own making something began to be fatal which was not contained in the [[destiny]] of his natal hour. oh, singular stupidity! a day is chosen on which to [[marry]]; and for this [[reason]], i [[believe]], that unless a day be chosen, the [[marriage]] may fall on an unlucky day, and turn out an unhappy one. what then becomes of what the stars have already decreed at the hour of birth? can a [[man]] be said to [[change]] by an act of [[choice]] that which has already been determined for him, whilst that which he himself has determined in the choosing of a day cannot be changed by another [[power]]? thus, if [[men]] alone, and not all things under [[heaven]], are [[subject]] to the influence of the stars, why do they choose some days as suitable for planting vines or trees, or for sowing grain, other days as suitable for taming beasts on, or for putting the males to the females, that the cows and mares may be impregnated, and for such-like things? if it be said that [[certain]] chosen days have an influence on these things, because the constellations [[rule]] over all terrestrial bodies [[body]], animate and inanimate, according to differences in moments of [[time]], let it be considered what innumerable multitudes of beings are born or arise, or take their origin at the very same instant of [[time]], which come to ends so different, that they may persuade any little boy that these observations about days are ridiculous. for who is so mad as to dare affirm that all trees, all herbs, all beasts, serpents, birds, fishes, worms, have each separately their own moments of birth or commencement? nevertheless, [[men]] are wont, in order to try the [[skill]] of the mathematicians, to bring before them the constellations of dumb animals, the constellations of whose birth they diligently observe at [[home]] with a view to this discovery; and they prefer those mathematicians to all others, who say from the inspection of the constellations that they indicate the birth of a beast and not of a [[man]]. they also dare tell what [[kind]] of beast it is, whether it is a wool-bearing beast, or a beast suited for carrying burthens, or one fit for the plough, or for watching a house; for the astrologers are also tried with [[respect]] to the fates [[fate]] of dogs, and their answers [[answer]] concerning these are followed by shouts of admiration on the[pg 188] part of those who consult them. they so [[deceive]] [[men]] as to make them [[think]] that during the birth of a [[man]] the births of all other beings are suspended, so that not even a fly comes to [[life]] at the same [[time]] that he is being born, under the same region of the heavens [[heaven]]. and if this be admitted with [[respect]] to the fly, the reasoning cannot stop there, but must ascend from flies till it lead them up to camels and elephants. nor are they willing to attend to this, that when a day has been chosen whereon to sow a field, so many grains fall into the ground simultaneously, germinate simultaneously, spring up, come to [[perfection]], and ripen simultaneously; and yet, of all the ears which are coeval, and, so to speak, congerminal, some are destroyed by mildew, some are devoured by the birds, and some are pulled by [[men]]. how can they say that all these had their different constellations, which they see coming to so different ends? will they confess that it is folly to choose days for such things, and to affirm that they do not come within the sphere of the celestial decree, whilst they [[subject]] [[men]] alone to the stars, on whom alone in the [[world]] [[god]] has bestowed [[free]] wills? all these things being considered, we have [[good]] [[reason]] to [[believe]] that, when the astrologers give very many wonderful answers [[answer]], it is to be attributed to the occult inspiration of spirits not of the [[best]] [[kind]], whose [[care]] it is to insinuate into the minds [[mind]] of [[men]], and to confirm in them, those false and noxious opinions [[opinion]] concerning the fatal influence of the stars, and not to their marking and inspecting of horoscopes, according to some [[kind]] of art [[arts]] which in reality has no existence.

8. concerning those who call by the name of [[fate]], not the position of the stars, but the connection of causes which depends on the will of [[god]].

but, as to those who call by the name of [[fate]], not the disposition of the stars as it may [[exist]] when any creature is conceived, or born, or commences its existence, but the whole connection and train of causes which makes everything become what it does become, there is no need that i should [[labour]] and strive with them in a merely verbal controversy, since they attribute the so-called order and connection of causes to the will and [[power]] of [[god]] most high, who is most rightly and most truly believed to [[know]] all things before they come[pg 189] to pass, and to leave nothing unordained; from whom are all powers [[power]], although the wills of all are not from him. now, that it is chiefly the will of [[god]] most high, whose [[power]] extends itself irresistibly through all things which they call [[fate]], is proved by the following verses, of which, if i mistake not, annæus seneca is the author:—

"father supreme, thou ruler of the lofty heavens [[heaven]], lead me where'er it is thy [[pleasure]]; i will give a prompt [[obedience]], making no delay, lo! here i am. promptly i come to do thy [[sovereign]] will; if thy command shall thwart my inclination, i will still [[follow]] thee groaning, and the [[work]] assigned, with all the suffering of a [[mind]] repugnant, will perform, being [[evil]]; which, had i been [[good]], i should have undertaken and performed, though hard, with [[virtuous]] cheerfulness. the fates [[fate]] do lead the [[man]] that follows willing; but the [[man]] that is unwilling, him they drag."[187]
most evidently, in this [[last]] verse, he calls that "fate" which he had before called "the will of the [[father]] supreme," whom, he says, he is ready to obey that he may be [[led]], being willing, not dragged, being unwilling, since "the fates [[fate]] do lead the [[man]] that follows willing, but the [[man]] that is unwilling, him they drag."

the following homeric lines, which cicero translates into latin, also favour this [[opinion]]:—

"such are the minds [[mind]] of [[men]], as is the [[light]] which [[father]] jove himself doth pour illustrious o'er the fruitful [[earth]]."[188]
not that cicero wishes [[wish]] that a poetical sentiment should have any weight in a [[question]] like this; for when he says that the stoics, when asserting the [[power]] of [[fate]], were in the habit of using these verses from [[homer]], he is not treating concerning the [[opinion]] of that poet, but concerning that of those [[philosophers]], since by these verses, which they quote in connection with the controversy which they hold about [[fate]], is most distinctly manifested what it is which they reckon [[fate]], since they call by the name of [[jupiter]] him whom they reckon the supreme [[god]], from whom, they say, hangs the whole chain of fates [[fate]].

[pg 190]

9. concerning the foreknowledge of [[god]] and the [[free]] will of [[man]], in opposition to the definition of cicero.

the manner in which cicero addresses himself to the task of refuting the stoics, shows that he did not [[think]] he could effect anything against them in argument unless he had first demolished divination.[189] and this he attempts to accomplish by denying that there is any [[knowledge]] of future things, and maintains with all his might that there is no such [[knowledge]] either in [[god]] or [[man]], and that there is no prediction of events. thus he both denies the foreknowledge of [[god]], and attempts by [[vain]] arguments, and by opposing to himself [[certain]] oracles very easy to be refuted, to overthrow all prophecy, even such as is clearer than the [[light]] (though even these oracles are not refuted by him).

but, in refuting these conjectures of the mathematicians, his argument is triumphant, because truly these are such as [[destroy]] and refute themselves. nevertheless, they are far more tolerable who assert the fatal influence of the stars than they who deny the foreknowledge of future events. for, to confess that [[god]] exists, and at the same [[time]] to deny that he has foreknowledge of future things, is the most manifest folly. this cicero himself saw, and therefore attempted to assert the doctrine embodied in the words of [[scripture]], "the [[fool]] hath said in his [[heart]], there is no [[god]]."[190] that, however, he did not do in his own [[person]], for he saw how odious and offensive such an [[opinion]] would be; and, therefore in his [[book]] on the [[nature]] of the gods,[191] he makes cotta dispute concerning this against the stoics, and preferred to give his own [[opinion]] in favour of lucilius balbus, to whom he assigned the defence of the stoical position, rather than in favour of cotta, who maintained that no divinity exists. however, in his [[book]] on divination, he in his own [[person]] most openly opposes the doctrine of the prescience of future things. but all this he seems to do in order that he may not grant the doctrine of [[fate]], and by so doing [[destroy]] [[free]] will. for he thinks [[think]] that, the [[knowledge]] of future things being once conceded, [[fate]] follows as so necessary a consequence that it cannot be denied.

but, let these perplexing debatings and disputations of the[pg 191] [[philosophers]] go on as they may, we, in order that we may confess the most high and true [[god]] himself, do confess his will, supreme [[power]], and prescience. neither let us be afraid lest, after all, we do not do by will that which we do by will, because he, whose foreknowledge is infallible, foreknew that we would do it. it was this which cicero was afraid of, and therefore opposed foreknowledge. the stoics also maintained that all things do not come to pass by necessity, although they contended that all things happen according to [[destiny]]. what is it, then, that cicero feared in the prescience of future things? doubtless it was this,—that if all future things have been foreknown, they will happen in the order in which they have been foreknown; and if they come to pass in this order, there is a [[certain]] order of things foreknown by [[god]]; and if a [[certain]] order of things, then a [[certain]] order of causes, for nothing can happen which is not preceded by some efficient cause. but if there is a [[certain]] order of causes according to which everything happens which does happen, then by [[fate]], says he, all things happen which do happen. but if this be so, then is there nothing in our own [[power]], and there is no such thing as [[freedom]] of will; and if we grant that, says he, the whole economy of [[human]] [[life]] is subverted. in [[vain]] are laws [[law]] enacted. in [[vain]] are reproaches, praises [[praise]], chidings, exhortations had recourse to; and there is no [[justice]] whatever in the appointment of rewards [[reward]] for the [[good]], and punishments [[punishment]] for the wicked. and that consequences so disgraceful, and absurd, and pernicious to [[humanity]] may not [[follow]], cicero chooses to reject the foreknowledge of future things, and shuts up the [[religious]] [[mind]] to this alternative, to make [[choice]] between two things, either that something is in our own [[power]], or that there is foreknowledge,—both of which cannot be true; but if the one is affirmed, the other is thereby denied. he therefore, like a truly [[great]] and [[wise]] [[man]], and one who consulted very much and very skilfully for the [[good]] of [[humanity]], of those two chose the [[freedom]] of the will, to confirm which he denied the foreknowledge of future things; and thus, wishing to make [[men]] [[free]], he makes them sacrilegious. but the [[religious]] [[mind]] chooses both, confesses both, and maintains both by the [[faith]] of piety. but how so? says cicero; for the[pg 192] [[knowledge]] of future things being granted, there follows a chain of consequences which ends in this, that there can be nothing depending on our own [[free]] wills. and further, if there is anything depending on our wills, we must go backwards by the same steps of reasoning till we arrive at the conclusion that there is no foreknowledge of future things. for we go backwards through all the steps in the following order:—if there is [[free]] will, all things do not happen according to [[fate]]; if all things do not happen according to [[fate]], there is not a [[certain]] order of causes; and if there is not a [[certain]] order of causes, neither is there a [[certain]] order of things foreknown by [[god]],—for things cannot come to pass except they are preceded by efficient causes,—but, if there is no fixed and [[certain]] order of causes foreknown by [[god]], all things cannot be said to happen according as he foreknew that they would happen. and further, if it is not true that all things happen just as they have been foreknown by him, there is not, says he, in [[god]] any foreknowledge of future events.

now, against the sacrilegious and impious darings of [[reason]], we assert both that [[god]] knows [[know]] all things before they come to pass, and that we do by our [[free]] will whatsoever we [[know]] and [[feel]] to be done by us only because we will it. but that all things come to pass by [[fate]], we do not say; nay we affirm that nothing comes to pass by [[fate]]; for we demonstrate that the name of [[fate]], as it is wont to be used by those who speak of [[fate]], meaning thereby the position of the stars at the [[time]] of each one's conception or birth, is an unmeaning word, for astrology itself is a delusion. but an order of causes in which the highest efficiency is attributed to the will of [[god]], we neither deny nor do we designate it by the name of [[fate]], unless, perhaps, we may [[understand]] [[fate]] to mean that which is spoken, deriving it from fari, to speak; for we cannot deny that it is written in the [[sacred]] scriptures [[scripture]], "god hath spoken once; these two things have i heard, that [[power]] belongeth unto [[god]]. also unto thee, o [[god]], belongeth [[mercy]]: for thou wilt render unto every [[man]] according to his works [[work]]."[192] now the expression, "once hath he spoken," is to be understood as meaning "immovably,[pg 193]" that is, unchangeably hath he spoken, inasmuch as he knows [[know]] unchangeably all things which shall be, and all things which he will do. we might, then, use the word [[fate]] in the sense it bears when derived from fari, to speak, had it not already come to be understood in another sense, into which i am unwilling that the hearts [[heart]] of [[men]] should unconsciously slide. but it does not [[follow]] that, though there is for [[god]] a [[certain]] order of all causes, there must therefore be nothing depending on the [[free]] exercise of our own wills, for our wills themselves are included in that order of causes which is [[certain]] to [[god]], and is embraced by his foreknowledge, for [[human]] wills are also causes of [[human]] actions; and he who foreknew all the causes of things would certainly among those causes not have been ignorant of our wills. for even that very concession which cicero himself makes is enough to refute him in this argument. for what does it [[help]] him to say that nothing takes place without a cause, but that every cause is not fatal, there being a fortuitous cause, a [[natural]] cause, and a voluntary cause? it is sufficient that he confesses that whatever happens must be preceded by a cause. for we say that those causes which are called fortuitous are not a mere name for the absence of causes, but are only latent, and we attribute them either to the will of the true [[god]], or to that of spirits of some [[kind]] or other. and as to [[natural]] causes, we by no means separate them from the will of him who is the author and framer of all [[nature]]. but now as to voluntary causes. they are referable either to [[god]], or to angels, or to [[men]], or to animals of whatever description, if indeed those instinctive movements of animals devoid of [[reason]], by which, in accordance with their own [[nature]], they seek or shun various things, are to be called wills. and when i speak of the wills of angels, i mean either the wills of [[good]] angels, whom we call the angels of [[god]], or of the wicked angels, whom we call the angels of the [[devil]], or demons. also by the wills of [[men]] i mean the wills either of the [[good]] or of the wicked. and from this we conclude that there are no efficient causes of all things which come to pass unless voluntary causes, that is, such as belong to that [[nature]] which is the spirit of [[life]]. for the air or wind is called spirit, but, inasmuch as it is a [[body]], it is not[pg 194] the spirit of [[life]]. the spirit of [[life]], therefore, which quickens all things, and is the creator of every [[body]], and of every created spirit, is [[god]] himself, the uncreated spirit. in his supreme will resides the [[power]] which acts on the wills of all created spirits, helping the [[good]], judging the [[evil]], controlling all, granting [[power]] to some, not granting it to others. for, as he is the creator of all natures [[nature]], so also is he the bestower of all powers [[power]], not of all wills; for wicked wills are not from him, being contrary to [[nature]], which is from him. as to bodies [[body]], they are more [[subject]] to wills: some to our wills, by which i mean the wills of all living mortal creatures, but more to the wills of [[men]] than of beasts. but all of them are most of all [[subject]] to the will of [[god]], to whom all wills also are [[subject]], since they have no [[power]] except what he has bestowed upon them. the cause of things, therefore, which makes but is not made, is [[god]]; but all other causes both make and are made. such are all created spirits, and especially the [[rational]]. material causes, therefore, which may rather be said to be made than to make, are not to be reckoned among efficient causes, because they can only do what the wills of spirits do by them. how, then, does an order of causes which is [[certain]] to the foreknowledge of [[god]] necessitate that there should be nothing which is dependent on our wills, when our wills themselves have a very important place in the order of causes? cicero, then, contends with those who call this order of causes fatal, or rather designate this order itself by the name of [[fate]]; to which we have an abhorrence, especially on account of the word, which [[men]] have become accustomed to [[understand]] as meaning what is not true. but, whereas he denies that the order of all causes is most [[certain]], and perfectly clear to the prescience of [[god]], we detest his [[opinion]] more than the stoics do. for he either denies that [[god]] exists,—which, indeed, in an assumed personage, he has laboured to do, in his [[book]] de natura deorum,—or if he confesses that he exists, but denies that he is prescient of future things, what is that but just "the [[fool]] saying in his [[heart]] there is no [[god]]?" for one who is not prescient of all future things is not [[god]]. wherefore our wills also have just so much [[power]] as [[god]] willed and foreknew that they should[pg 195] have; and therefore whatever [[power]] they have, they have it within most [[certain]] limits; and whatever they are to do, they are most assuredly to do, for he whose foreknowledge is infallible foreknew that they would have the [[power]] to do it, and would do it. wherefore, if i should choose to apply the name of [[fate]] to anything at all, i should rather say that [[fate]] belongs to the weaker of two parties, will to the stronger, who has the other in his [[power]], than that the [[freedom]] of our will is excluded by that order of causes, which, by an unusual application of the word peculiar to themselves, the stoics call [[fate]].

10. whether our wills are ruled by necessity.

wherefore, neither is that necessity to be feared, for dread of which the stoics laboured to make such distinctions among the causes of things as should enable them to rescue [[certain]] things from the dominion of necessity, and to [[subject]] others to it. among those things which they wished not to be [[subject]] to necessity they placed our wills, knowing that they would not be [[free]] if subjected to necessity. for if that is to be called our necessity which is not in our [[power]], but even though we be unwilling effects what it can effect,—as, for instance, the necessity of [[death]],—it is manifest that our wills by which we [[live]] uprightly or wickedly are not under such a necessity; for we do many things which, if we were not willing, we should certainly not do. this is primarily true of the act of willing itself,—for if we will, it is; if we will not, it is not,—for we should not will if we were unwilling. but if we define necessity to be that according to which we say that it is necessary that anything be of such or such a [[nature]], or be done in such and such a manner, i [[know]] not why we should have any dread of that necessity taking away the [[freedom]] of our will. for we do not put the [[life]] of [[god]] or the foreknowledge of [[god]] under necessity if we should say that it is necessary that [[god]] should [[live]] for ever, and foreknow all things; as neither is his [[power]] diminished when we say that he cannot [[die]] or fall into error,—for this is in such a way impossible to him, that if it were possible for him, he would be of less [[power]]. but assuredly he is rightly called omnipotent, though he can neither [[die]] nor fall into error. for he is called omnipotent on account[pg 196] of his doing what he wills, not on account of his suffering what he wills not; for if that should befall him, he would by no means be omnipotent. wherefore, he cannot do some things for the very [[reason]] that he is omnipotent. so also, when we say that it is necessary that, when we will, we will by [[free]] [[choice]], in so saying we both affirm what is true beyond [[doubt]], and do not still [[subject]] our wills thereby to a necessity which destroys [[liberty]]. our wills, therefore, [[exist]] as wills, and do themselves whatever we do by willing, and which would not be done if we were unwilling. but when any one suffers anything, being unwilling, by the will of another, even in that case will retains its essential validity,—we do not mean the will of the party who inflicts the suffering, for we resolve it into the [[power]] of [[god]]. for if a will should simply [[exist]], but not be able to do what it wills, it would be overborne by a more powerful will. nor would this be the case unless there had existed will, and that not the will of the other party, but the will of him who willed, but was not able to accomplish what he willed. therefore, whatsoever a [[man]] suffers contrary to his own will, he ought not to attribute to the will of [[men]], or of angels, or of any created spirit, but rather to his will who gives [[power]] to wills. it is not the case, therefore, that because [[god]] foreknew what would be in the [[power]] of our wills, there is for that [[reason]] nothing in the [[power]] of our wills. for he who foreknew this did not foreknow nothing. moreover, if he who foreknew what would be in the [[power]] of our wills did not foreknow nothing, but something, assuredly, even though he did foreknow, there is something in the [[power]] of our wills. therefore we are by no means compelled, either, retaining the prescience of [[god]], to take away the [[freedom]] of the will, or, retaining the [[freedom]] of the will, to deny that he is prescient of future things, which is impious. but we embrace both. we faithfully and sincerely confess both. the former, that we may [[believe]] well; the latter, that we may [[live]] well. for he lives [[life]] ill who does not [[believe]] well concerning [[god]]. wherefore, be it far from us, in order to maintain our [[freedom]], to deny the prescience of him by whose [[help]] we are or shall be [[free]]. consequently, it is not in [[vain]] that laws [[law]] are enacted, and that reproaches, exhortations, praises [[praise]], and vituperations[pg 197] are had recourse to; for these also he foreknew, and they are of [[great]] avail, even as [[great]] as he foreknew that they would be of. prayers, also, are of avail to procure those things which he foreknew that he would grant to those who offered them; and with [[justice]] have rewards [[reward]] been appointed for [[good]] deeds, and punishments [[punishment]] for sins [[sin]]. for a [[man]] does not therefore [[sin]] because [[god]] foreknew that he would [[sin]]. nay, it cannot be doubted but that it is the [[man]] himself who sins [[sin]] when he does [[sin]], because he, whose foreknowledge is infallible, foreknew not that [[fate]], or [[fortune]], or something else would [[sin]], but that the [[man]] himself would [[sin]], who, if he wills not, sins [[sin]] not. but if he shall not will to [[sin]], even this did [[god]] foreknow.

11. concerning the universal providence of [[god]] in the laws [[law]] of which all things are comprehended.

therefore [[god]] supreme and true, with his word and holy spirit (which three are one), one [[god]] omnipotent, creator and maker of every [[soul]] and of every [[body]]; by whose gift all are [[happy]] who are [[happy]] through verity and not through vanity; who made [[man]] a [[rational]] animal consisting of [[soul]] and [[body]], who, when he sinned, neither permitted him to go unpunished, nor left him without [[mercy]]; who has given to the [[good]] and to the [[evil]], being in [[common]] with stones, vegetable [[life]] in [[common]] with trees, sensuous [[life]] in [[common]] with brutes, intellectual [[life]] in [[common]] with angels alone; from whom is every mode, every [[species]], every order; from whom are measure, number, weight; from whom is everything which has an existence in [[nature]], of whatever [[kind]] it be, and of whatever value; from whom are the seeds of forms and the forms of seeds, and the motion of seeds and of forms; who gave also to flesh its origin, [[beauty]], health, reproductive fecundity, disposition of members, and the salutary concord of its parts; who also to the irrational [[soul]] has given memory, sense, appetite, but to the [[rational]] [[soul]], in addition to these, has given [[intelligence]] and will; who has not left, not to speak of [[heaven]] and [[earth]], angels and [[men]], but not even the entrails of the smallest and most contemptible animal, or the feather of a bird, or the little flower of a plant, or the leaf of a tree, without an harmony, and, as it were, a mutual [[peace]] among[pg 198] all its parts;—that [[god]] can never be believed to have left the kingdoms [[kingdom]] of [[men]], their dominations and servitudes, outside of the laws [[law]] of his providence.

12. by what virtues [[virtue]] the ancient romans merited that the true [[god]], although they did not [[worship]] him, should enlarge their [[empire]].

wherefore let us go on to consider what virtues [[virtue]] of the romans they were which the true [[god]], in whose [[power]] are also the kingdoms [[kingdom]] of the [[earth]], condescended to [[help]] in order to raise the [[empire]], and also for what [[reason]] he did so. and, in order to discuss this [[question]] on clearer ground, we have written the former books [[book]], to show that the [[power]] of those gods, who, they [[thought]], were to be worshipped with such trifling and silly rites, had nothing to do in this matter; and also what we have already accomplished of the [[present]] volume, to refute the doctrine of [[fate]], lest any one who might have been already persuaded that the roman [[empire]] was not extended and preserved by the [[worship]] of these gods, might still be attributing its extension and preservation to some [[kind]] of [[fate]], rather than to the most powerful will of [[god]] most high. the ancient and primitive romans, therefore, though their [[history]] shows us that, like all the other nations, with the sole exception of the hebrews, they worshipped false gods, and sacrificed victims, not to [[god]], but to demons, have nevertheless this commendation bestowed on them by their historian, that they were "greedy of [[praise]], prodigal of [[wealth]], desirous of [[great]] [[glory]], and content with a moderate [[fortune]]."[193] [[glory]] they most ardently loved: for it they wished to [[live]], for it they did not hesitate to [[die]]. every other [[desire]] was repressed by the [[strength]] of their passion for that one thing. at length their [[country]] itself, because it seemed inglorious to serve, but glorious to [[rule]] and to command, they first earnestly [[desired]] to be [[free]], and then to be mistress. hence it was that, not enduring the domination of kings [[king]], they put the [[government]] into the hands of two chiefs [[chief]], holding office for a year, who were called consuls, not kings [[king]] or lords [[lord]].[194] but [[royal]] pomp[pg 199] seemed inconsistent with the administration of a ruler (regentis), or the benevolence of one who consults (that is, for the [[public]] good) (consulentis), but rather with the haughtiness of a [[lord]] (dominantis). [[king]] tarquin, therefore, having been [[banished]], and the consular [[government]] having been instituted, it followed, as the same author already alluded to says in his praises [[praise]] of the romans, that "the [[state]] grew with amazing rapidity after it had obtained [[liberty]], so [[great]] a [[desire]] of [[glory]] had taken possession of it." that eagerness for [[praise]] and [[desire]] of [[glory]], then, was that which accomplished those many wonderful things, laudable, doubtless, and glorious according to [[human]] [[judgment]]. the same sallust praises [[praise]] the [[great]] [[men]] of his own [[time]], marcus cato, and caius cæsar, saying that for a long [[time]] the [[republic]] had no one [[great]] in [[virtue]], but that within his memory there had been these two [[men]] of eminent [[virtue]], and very different pursuits. now, among the praises [[praise]] which he pronounces on cæsar he put this, that he wished for a [[great]] [[empire]], an [[army]], and a new [[war]], that he might have a sphere where his genius and [[virtue]] might shine forth. thus it was ever the prayer of [[men]] of heroic [[character]] that bellona would excite miserable nations to [[war]], and lash them into agitation with her bloody scourge, so that there might be [[occasion]] for the display of their valour. this, forsooth, is what that [[desire]] of [[praise]] and thirst for [[glory]] did. wherefore, by the [[love]] of [[liberty]] in the first place, afterwards also by that of domination and through the [[desire]] of [[praise]] and [[glory]], they achieved many [[great]] things; and their most eminent poet testifies to their having been prompted by all these motives:

"porsenna there, with [[pride]] elate, bids [[rome]] to tarquin ope her gate; with arms he hems the [[city]] in, æneas' sons [[son]] stand firm to [[win]]."[195]
at that [[time]] it was their [[greatest]] [[ambition]] either to [[die]] bravely or to [[live]] [[free]]; but when [[liberty]] was obtained, so [[great]] a [[desire]] of [[glory]] took possession of them, that [[liberty]] alone was not enough unless domination also should be sought,[pg 200] their [[great]] [[ambition]] being that which the same poet puts into the mouth of [[jupiter]]:

"nay, juno's [[self]], whose wild alarms set ocean, [[earth]], and [[heaven]] in arms, shall [[change]] for smiles her moody frown, and vie with me in zeal to [[crown]] rome's sons [[son]], the nation of the gown. so stands my will. there comes a day, while rome's [[great]] ages [[age]] hold their way, when old assaracus's sons [[son]] shall quit them on the myrmidons, o'er phthia and mycenæ reign, and humble argos to their chain."[196]
which things, indeed, [[virgil]] makes [[jupiter]] predict as future, whilst, in reality, he was only himself passing in review in his own [[mind]] things which were already done, and which were beheld by him as [[present]] realities. but i have mentioned them with the intention of showing that, next to [[liberty]], the romans so highly esteemed domination, that it received a place among those things on which they bestowed the [[greatest]] [[praise]]. hence also it is that that poet, preferring to the [[arts]] of other nations those [[arts]] which peculiarly belong to the romans, namely, the [[arts]] of ruling and commanding, and of subjugating and vanquishing nations, says,

"others, belike, with happier grace, from bronze or stone shall call the face, plead doubtful causes, map the skies [[sky]], and tell when planets set or rise; but roman thou, do thou control the nations far and wide; be this thy genius, to impose the [[rule]] of [[peace]] on vanquished foes, show [[pity]] to the humbled [[soul]], and crush the sons [[son]] of [[pride]]."[197]
these [[arts]] they exercised with the more [[skill]] the less they gave themselves up to pleasures [[pleasure]], and to enervation of [[body]] and [[mind]] in coveting and amassing riches [[rich]], and through these corrupting morals [[moral]], by extorting them from the miserable [[citizens]] and lavishing them on base stage-players. hence these [[men]] of base [[character]], who abounded when sallust wrote and [[virgil]] sang these things, did not seek after honours[pg 201] and [[glory]] by these [[arts]], but by treachery and deceit. wherefore the same says, "but at first it was rather [[ambition]] than avarice that stirred the minds [[mind]] of [[men]], which [[vice]], however, is nearer to [[virtue]]. for [[glory]], [[honour]], and [[power]] are [[desired]] alike by the [[good]] [[man]] and by the ignoble; but the former," he says, "strives onward to them by the true way, whilst the other, knowing nothing of the [[good]] [[arts]], seeks them by fraud and deceit."[198] and what is meant by seeking the attainment of [[glory]], [[honour]], and [[power]] by [[good]] [[arts]], is to seek them by [[virtue]], and not by deceitful intrigue; for the [[good]] and the ignoble [[man]] alike [[desire]] these things, but the [[good]] [[man]] strives to overtake them by the true way. the way is [[virtue]], along which he presses as to the goal of possession—namely, to [[glory]], [[honour]], and [[power]]. now that this was a sentiment engrained in the roman [[mind]], is indicated even by the temples of their gods; for they built in very close proximity the temples of [[virtue]] and [[honour]], worshipping as gods the gifts of [[god]]. hence we can [[understand]] what they who were [[good]] [[thought]] to be the end of [[virtue]], and to what they ultimately referred it, namely, to [[honour]]; for, as to the [[bad]], they had no [[virtue]] though they [[desired]] [[honour]], and strove to possess it by fraud and deceit. [[praise]] of a higher [[kind]] is bestowed upon cato, for he says of him, "the less he sought [[glory]], the more it followed him."[199] we say [[praise]] of a higher [[kind]]; for the [[glory]] with the [[desire]] of which the romans burned is the [[judgment]] of [[men]] thinking well of [[men]]. and therefore [[virtue]] is [[better]], which is content with no [[human]] [[judgment]] save that of one's own [[conscience]]. whence the apostle says, "for this is our [[glory]], the testimony of our [[conscience]]."[200] and in another place he says, "but let every one prove his own [[work]], and then he shall have [[glory]] in himself, and not in another."[201] that [[glory]], [[honour]], and [[power]], therefore, which they [[desired]] for themselves, and to which the [[good]] sought to attain by [[good]] [[arts]], should not be sought after by [[virtue]], but [[virtue]] by them. for there is no true [[virtue]] except that which is directed towards that end in which is the highest and ultimate good[pg 202] of [[man]]. wherefore even the honours [[honour]] which cato sought he ought not to have sought, but the [[state]] ought to have conferred them on him unsolicited, on account of his virtues [[virtue]].

but, of the two [[great]] romans of that [[time]], cato was he whose [[virtue]] was by far the nearest to the true [[idea]] of [[virtue]]. wherefore, let us refer to the [[opinion]] of cato himself, to discover what was the [[judgment]] he had formed concerning the condition of the [[state]] both then and in former times [[time]]. "i do not [[think]]," he says, "that it was by arms that our [[ancestors]] made the [[republic]] [[great]] from being small. had that been the case, the [[republic]] of our day would have been by far more flourishing than that of their times [[time]], for the number of our allies and [[citizens]] is far greater; and, besides, we possess a far greater abundance of armour and of horses than they did. but it was other things than these that made them [[great]], and we have none of them: industry at [[home]], just [[government]] without, a [[mind]] [[free]] in deliberation, addicted neither to crime nor to [[lust]]. instead of these, we have luxury and avarice, [[poverty]] in the [[state]], opulence among [[citizens]]; we laud riches [[rich]], we [[follow]] laziness; there is no difference made between the [[good]] and the [[bad]]; all the rewards [[reward]] of [[virtue]] are got possession of by intrigue. and no wonder, when every [[individual]] consults only for his own [[good]], when ye are the slaves [[slave]] of [[pleasure]] at [[home]], and, in [[public]] affairs, of [[money]] and favour, no wonder that an onslaught is made upon the unprotected [[republic]]."[202]

he who hears these words of cato or of sallust probably thinks [[think]] that such [[praise]] bestowed on the ancient romans was applicable to all of them, or, at least, to very many of them. it is not so; otherwise the things which cato himself writes, and which i have quoted in the second [[book]] of this [[work]], would not be true. in that passage he says, that even from the very beginning of the [[state]] wrongs [[wrong]] were committed by the more powerful, which [[led]] to the separation of the [[people]] from the fathers [[father]], besides which there were other internal dissensions; and the only [[time]] at which there existed a just and moderate administration was after the [[banishment]] of the kings [[king]], and that no longer than whilst they had cause to be afraid of tarquin, and were carrying on the grievous [[war]] which had[pg 203] been undertaken on his account against etruria; but afterwards the fathers [[father]] [[oppressed]] the [[people]] as slaves [[slave]], flogged them as the kings [[king]] had done, drove them from their [[land]], and, to the exclusion of all others, held the [[government]] in their own hands alone. and to these discords, whilst the fathers [[father]] were wishing to [[rule]], and the [[people]] were unwilling to serve, the second punic [[war]] put an end; for again [[great]] [[fear]] began to press upon their disquieted minds [[mind]], holding them back from those distractions by another and greater [[anxiety]], and bringing them back to civil concord. but the [[great]] things which were then achieved were accomplished through the administration of a few [[men]], who were [[good]] in their own way. and by the [[wisdom]] and forethought of these few [[good]] [[men]], which first enabled the [[republic]] to endure these evils [[evil]] and mitigated them, it waxed greater and greater. and this the same historian affirms, when he says that, reading and hearing of the many illustrious achievements of the roman [[people]] in [[peace]] and in [[war]], by [[land]] and by sea, he wished to [[understand]] what it was by which these [[great]] things were specially sustained. for he knew that very often the romans had with a small company contended with [[great]] legions of the [[enemy]]; and he knew also that with small resources they had carried on wars [[war]] with opulent kings [[king]]. and he says that, after having given the matter much consideration, it seemed evident to him that the pre-eminent [[virtue]] of a few [[citizens]] had achieved the whole, and that that explained how [[poverty]] overcame [[wealth]], and small numbers [[great]] multitudes. but, he adds, after that the [[state]] had been corrupted by luxury and indolence, again the [[republic]], by its own greatness, was able to bear the vices [[vice]] of its magistrates and generals. wherefore even the praises [[praise]] of cato are only applicable to a few; for only a few were possessed of that [[virtue]] which leads [[men]] to pursue after [[glory]], [[honour]], and [[power]] by the true way,—that is, by [[virtue]] itself. this industry at [[home]], of which cato speaks, was the consequence of a [[desire]] to enrich the [[public]] treasury, even though the result should be [[poverty]] at [[home]]; and therefore, when he speaks of the [[evil]] arising out of the [[corruption]] of morals [[moral]], he reverses the expression, and says, "poverty in the [[state]], riches [[rich]] at [[home]]."

[pg 204]

13. concerning the [[love]] of [[praise]], which, though it is a [[vice]], is reckoned a [[virtue]], because by it greater [[vice]] is restrained.

wherefore, when the kingdoms [[kingdom]] of the east had been illustrious for a long [[time]], it pleased [[god]] that there should also arise a western [[empire]], which, though later in [[time]], should be more illustrious in extent and greatness. and, in order that it might overcome the grievous evils [[evil]] which existed among other nations, he purposely granted it to such [[men]] as, for the sake of [[honour]], and [[praise]], and [[glory]], consulted well for their [[country]], in whose [[glory]] they sought their own, and whose safety they did not hesitate to prefer to their own, suppressing the [[desire]] of [[wealth]] and many other vices [[vice]] for this one [[vice]], namely, the [[love]] of [[praise]]. for he has the soundest perception who recognises that even the [[love]] of [[praise]] is a [[vice]]; nor has this escaped the perception of the poet horace, who says,

"you're bloated by [[ambition]]? take [[advice]]: yon [[book]] will ease you if you [[read]] it thrice."[203]
and the same poet, in a lyric [[song]], hath thus spoken with the [[desire]] of repressing the passion for domination:

"rule an ambitious spirit, and thou hast a wider [[kingdom]] than if thou shouldst join to distant gades lybia, and thus shouldst hold in service either carthaginian."[204]
nevertheless, they who restrain baser lusts, not by the [[power]] of the holy spirit obtained by the [[faith]] of piety, or by the [[love]] of intelligible [[beauty]], but by [[desire]] of [[human]] [[praise]], or, at all events, restrain them [[better]] by the [[love]] of such [[praise]], are not indeed yet holy, but only less base. even tully was not able to conceal this [[fact]]; for, in the same books [[book]] which he wrote, de republica, when speaking concerning the [[education]] of a [[chief]] of the [[state]], who ought, he says, to be nourished on [[glory]], goes on to say that their [[ancestors]] did many wonderful and illustrious things through [[desire]] of [[glory]]. so far, therefore, from resisting this [[vice]], they even [[thought]] that it ought to be excited and kindled up, supposing that that would be beneficial to the [[republic]]. but not even in his books [[book]] on [[philosophy]] does tully dissimulate this[pg 205] poisonous [[opinion]], for he there avows it more clearly than day. for when he is speaking of those studies which are to be pursued with a view to the true [[good]], and not with the vainglorious [[desire]] of [[human]] [[praise]], he introduces the following universal and general statement:

"honour nourishes the [[arts]], and all are stimulated to the prosecution of studies by [[glory]]; and those pursuits are always neglected which are generally discredited."[205]

14. concerning the eradication of the [[love]] of [[human]] [[praise]], because all the [[glory]] of the righteous is in [[god]].

it is, therefore, doubtless far [[better]] to resist this [[desire]] than to yield to it, for the purer one is from this defilement, the liker is he to [[god]]; and, though this [[vice]] be not thoroughly eradicated from his [[heart]],—for it does not cease to tempt even the minds [[mind]] of those who are making [[good]] [[progress]] in [[virtue]],—at any rate, let the [[desire]] of [[glory]] be surpassed by the [[love]] of [[righteousness]], so that, if there be seen anywhere "lying neglected things which are generally discredited," if they are [[good]], if they are [[right]], even the [[love]] of [[human]] [[praise]] may blush and yield to the [[love]] of [[truth]]. for so hostile is this [[vice]] to pious [[faith]], if the [[love]] of [[glory]] be greater in the [[heart]] than the [[fear]] or [[love]] of [[god]], that the [[lord]] said, "how can ye [[believe]], who look for [[glory]] from one another, and do not seek the [[glory]] which is from [[god]] alone?"[206] also, concerning some who had believed on him, but were afraid to confess him openly, the evangelist says, "they loved the [[praise]] of [[men]] more than the [[praise]] of [[god]];"[207] which did not the holy [[apostles]], who, when they proclaimed the name of [[christ]] in those places where it was not only discredited, and therefore neglected,—according as cicero says, "those things are always neglected which are generally discredited,"—but was even held in the utmost detestation, holding to what they had heard from the [[good]] master, who was also the physician of minds [[mind]], "if any one shall deny me before [[men]], him will i also deny before my [[father]] who is in [[heaven]], and before the angels of [[god]],"[208] amidst maledictions and reproaches, and most grievous persecutions and cruel punishments [[punishment]],[pg 206] were not deterred from the preaching of [[human]] salvation by the noise of [[human]] indignation. and when, as they did and spake [[divine]] things, and lived [[divine]] lives [[life]], conquering, as it were, hard hearts [[heart]], and introducing into them the [[peace]] of [[righteousness]], [[great]] [[glory]] followed them in the [[church]] of [[christ]], they did not rest in that as in the end of their [[virtue]], but, referring that [[glory]] itself to the [[glory]] of [[god]], by whose grace they were what they were, they sought to kindle, also by that same flame, the minds [[mind]] of those for whose [[good]] they consulted, to the [[love]] of him, by whom they could be made to be what they themselves were. for their master had taught them not to seek to be [[good]] for the sake of [[human]] [[glory]], saying, "take heed that ye do not your [[righteousness]] before [[men]] to be seen of them, or otherwise ye shall not have a [[reward]] from your [[father]] who is in [[heaven]]."[209] but again, lest, understanding this wrongly, they should, through [[fear]] of pleasing [[men]], be less useful through concealing their goodness, showing for what end they ought to make it known, he says, "let your works [[work]] shine before [[men]], that they may see your [[good]] deeds, and glorify your [[father]] who is in [[heaven]]."[210] not, observe, "that ye may be seen by them, that is, in order that their [[eyes]] may be directed upon you,"—for of yourselves ye are nothing,—but "that they may glorify your [[father]] who is in [[heaven]]," by fixing their regards on whom they may become such as ye are. these the martyrs followed, who surpassed the scævolas, and the curtiuses, and the deciuses, both in true [[virtue]], because in true piety, and also in the greatness of their number. but since those romans were in an earthly [[city]], and had before them, as the end of all the offices undertaken in its behalf, its safety, and a [[kingdom]], not in [[heaven]], but in [[earth]],—not in the sphere of eternal [[life]], but in the sphere of demise and succession, where the [[dead]] are succeeded by the dying,—what else but [[glory]] should they [[love]], by which they wished even after [[death]] to [[live]] in the mouths of their admirers?

15. concerning the temporal [[reward]] which [[god]] granted to the virtues [[virtue]] of the romans.

now, therefore, with regard to those to whom [[god]] did not[pg 207] [[purpose]] to give eternal [[life]] with his holy angels in his own celestial [[city]], to the [[society]] of which that true piety which does not render the service of [[religion]], which the greeks [[greek]] call λατρεία, to any save the true [[god]] conducts, if he had also withheld from them the terrestrial [[glory]] of that most excellent [[empire]], a [[reward]] would not have been rendered to their [[good]] [[arts]],—that is, their virtues [[virtue]],—by which they sought to attain so [[great]] [[glory]]. for as to those who seem to do some [[good]] that they may receive [[glory]] from [[men]], the [[lord]] also says, "verily i say unto you, they have received their [[reward]]."[211] so also these despised their own private affairs for the sake of the [[republic]], and for its treasury resisted avarice, consulted for the [[good]] of their [[country]] with a spirit of [[freedom]], addicted neither to what their laws [[law]] pronounced to be crime nor to [[lust]]. by all these acts, as by the true way, they pressed forward to honours [[honour]], [[power]], and [[glory]]; they were honoured among almost all nations; they imposed the laws [[law]] of their [[empire]] upon many nations; and at this day, both in literature and [[history]], they are glorious among almost all nations. there is no [[reason]] why they should [[complain]] against the [[justice]] of the supreme and true [[god]],—"they have received their [[reward]]."

16. concerning the [[reward]] of the holy [[citizens]] of the celestial [[city]], to whom the [[example]] of the virtues [[virtue]] of the roman are useful.

but the [[reward]] of the saints is far different, who even here endured reproaches for that [[city]] of [[god]] which is hateful to the lovers of this [[world]]. that [[city]] is eternal. there none are born, for none [[die]]. there is true and full felicity,—not a [[goddess]], but a gift of [[god]]. thence we receive the pledge of [[faith]], whilst on our pilgrimage we sigh for its [[beauty]]. there rises not the sun on the [[good]] and the [[evil]], but the sun of [[righteousness]] protects the [[good]] alone. there no [[great]] industry shall be expended to enrich the [[public]] treasury by suffering privations at [[home]], for there is the [[common]] treasury of [[truth]]. and, therefore, it was not only for the sake of recompensing the [[citizens]] of [[rome]] that her [[empire]] and [[glory]] had been so signally extended, but also that the [[citizens]] of that eternal [[city]], during their pilgrimage here, might diligently and soberly contemplate these examples [[example]], and[pg 208] see what a [[love]] they owe to the supernal [[country]] on account of [[life]] eternal, if the terrestrial [[country]] was so much beloved by its [[citizens]] on account of [[human]] [[glory]].

17. to what [[profit]] the romans carried on wars [[war]], and how much they contributed to the well-being of those whom they conquered.

for, as far as this [[life]] of mortals is concerned, which is spent and ended in a few days, what does it matter under whose [[government]] a dying [[man]] lives [[life]], if they who govern do not [[force]] him to impiety and [[iniquity]]? did the romans at all harm those nations, on whom, when subjugated, they imposed their laws [[law]], except in as far as that was accomplished with [[great]] slaughter in [[war]]? now, had it been done with [[consent]] of the nations, it would have been done with greater [[success]], but there would have been no [[glory]] of [[conquest]], for neither did the romans themselves [[live]] exempt from those laws [[law]] which they imposed on others. had this been done without [[mars]] and bellona, so that there should have been no place for [[victory]], no one conquering where no one had fought, would not the condition of the romans and of the other nations have been one and the same, especially if that had been done at once which afterwards was done most humanely and most acceptably, namely, the admission of all to the rights [[right]] of roman [[citizens]] who belonged to the roman [[empire]], and if that had been made the [[privilege]] of all which was formerly the [[privilege]] of a few, with this one condition, that the humbler class who had no lands [[land]] of their own should [[live]] at the [[public]] expense—an alimentary impost, which would have been paid with a much [[better]] grace by them into the hands of [[good]] administrators of the [[republic]], of which they were members, by their own hearty [[consent]], than it would have been paid with had it to be extorted from them as conquered [[men]]? for i do not see what it makes for the safety, [[good]] morals [[moral]], and certainly not for the [[dignity]], of [[men]], that some have conquered and others have been conquered, except that it yields them that most insane pomp of [[human]] [[glory]], in which "they have received their [[reward]]," who burned with excessive [[desire]] of it, and carried on most eager wars [[war]]. for do not their lands [[land]] [[pay]] tribute? have they any [[privilege]] of learning what the others are not privileged to learn? are[pg 209] there not many senators in the other countries [[country]] who do not even [[know]] [[rome]] by sight? take away outward show,[212] and what are all [[men]] after all but [[men]]? but even though the perversity of the [[age]] should permit that all the [[better]] [[men]] should be more highly honoured than others, neither thus should [[human]] [[honour]] be held at a [[great]] price, for it is smoke which has no weight. but let us avail ourselves even in these things of the [[kindness]] of [[god]]. let us consider how [[great]] things they despised, how [[great]] things they endured, what lusts they subdued for the sake of [[human]] [[glory]], who merited that [[glory]], as it were, in [[reward]] for such virtues [[virtue]]; and let this be useful to us even in suppressing [[pride]], so that, as that [[city]] in which it has been promised us to reign as far surpasses this one as [[heaven]] is distant from the [[earth]], as eternal [[life]] surpasses temporal joy, solid [[glory]] empty [[praise]], or the [[society]] of angels the [[society]] of mortals, or the [[glory]] of him who made the sun and moon the [[light]] of the sun and moon, the [[citizens]] of so [[great]] a [[country]] may not seem to themselves to have done anything very [[great]], if, in order to obtain it, they have done some [[good]] works [[work]] or endured some evils [[evil]], when those [[men]] for this terrestrial [[country]] already obtained, did such [[great]] things, [[suffered]] such [[great]] things. and especially are all these things to be considered, because the remission of sins [[sin]] which collects [[citizens]] to the celestial [[country]] has something in it to which a shadowy resemblance is found in that asylum of romulus, whither escape from the [[punishment]] of all manner of crimes congregated that multitude with which the [[state]] was to be founded.

18. how far christians [[christian]] ought to be from boasting, if they have done anything for the [[love]] of the eternal [[country]], when the romans did such [[great]] things for [[human]] [[glory]] and a terrestrial [[city]].

what [[great]] thing, therefore, is it for that eternal and celestial [[city]] to despise all the charms of this [[world]], however pleasant, if for the sake of this terrestrial [[city]] brutus could even put to [[death]] his [[son]],—a [[sacrifice]] which the heavenly [[city]] compels no one to make? but certainly it is more difficult to put to [[death]] one's sons [[son]], than to do what is required to be done for the heavenly [[country]], even to distribute to the [[poor]] those[pg 210] things which were looked upon as things to be amassed and laid up for one's [[children]], or to let them go, if there arise any temptation which compels us to do so, for the sake of [[faith]] and [[righteousness]]. for it is not earthly riches [[rich]] which make us or our sons [[son]] [[happy]]; for they must either be lost by us in our lifetime, or be possessed when we are [[dead]], by whom we [[know]] not, or perhaps by whom we would not. but it is [[god]] who makes us [[happy]], who is the true riches [[rich]] of minds [[mind]]. but of brutus, even the poet who celebrates his praises [[praise]] testifies that it was the [[occasion]] of unhappiness to him that he slew his [[son]], for he says,

"and call his own rebellious seed for menaced [[liberty]] to bleed. unhappy father! howsoe'er the deed be judged by after days."[213]
but in the following verse he consoles him in his unhappiness, saying,

"his country's [[love]] shall all o'erbear."

there are those two things, namely, [[liberty]] and the [[desire]] of [[human]] [[praise]], which compelled the romans to admirable deeds. if, therefore, for the [[liberty]] of dying [[men]], and for the [[desire]] of [[human]] [[praise]] which is sought after by mortals, sons [[son]] could be put to [[death]] by a [[father]], what [[great]] thing is it, if, for the true [[liberty]] which has made us [[free]] from the dominion of [[sin]], and [[death]], and the [[devil]],—not through the [[desire]] of [[human]] [[praise]], but through the earnest [[desire]] of freeing [[men]], not from [[king]] tarquin, but from demons and the [[prince]] of the demons,—we should, i do not say put to [[death]] our sons [[son]], but reckon among our sons [[son]] christ's [[poor]] ones? if, also, another roman [[chief]], surnamed torquatus, slew his [[son]], not because he fought against his [[country]], but because, being challenged by an [[enemy]], he through youthful impetuosity fought, though for his [[country]], yet contrary to orders which he his [[father]] had given as general; and this he did, notwithstanding that his [[son]] was victorious, lest there should be more [[evil]] in the [[example]] of [[authority]] despised, than [[good]] in the [[glory]] of slaying an [[enemy]];—if, i say, torquatus acted thus, wherefore should they boast themselves, who, for the laws [[law]] of a celestial [[country]], despise all earthly [[good]] things, which are[pg 211] loved far less than sons [[son]]? if furius camillus, who was condemned by those who envied him, notwithstanding that he had thrown off from the necks of his countrymen the yoke of their most bitter enemies [[enemy]], the veientes, again delivered his ungrateful [[country]] from the gauls, because he had no other in which he could have [[better]] opportunities for living a [[life]] of [[glory]];—if camillus did thus, why should he be extolled as having done some [[great]] thing, who, having, it may be, [[suffered]] in the [[church]] at the hands of carnal enemies [[enemy]] most grievous and dishonouring injury, has not betaken himself to heretical enemies [[enemy]], or himself raised some heresy against her, but has rather defended her, as far as he was able, from the most pernicious perversity of heretics, since there is not another [[church]], i say not in which one can [[live]] a [[life]] of [[glory]], but in which eternal [[life]] can be obtained? if mucius, in order that [[peace]] might be made with [[king]] porsenna, who was pressing the romans with a most grievous [[war]], when he did not succeed in slaying porsenna, but slew another by mistake for him, reached forth his [[right]] hand and laid it on a red-hot altar, saying that many such as he saw him to be had conspired for his destruction, so that porsenna, terrified at his daring, and at the [[thought]] of a conspiracy of such as he, without any delay recalled all his warlike purposes [[purpose]], and made [[peace]];—if, i say, mucius did this, who shall speak of his meritorious claims to the [[kingdom]] of [[heaven]], if for it he may have given to the flames not one hand, but even his whole [[body]], and that not by his own spontaneous act, but because he was persecuted by another? if curtius, spurring on his steed, threw himself all armed into a precipitous gulf, obeying the oracles of their gods, which had commanded that the romans should throw into that gulf the [[best]] thing which they possessed, and they could only [[understand]] thereby that, since they excelled in [[men]] and arms, the gods had commanded that an armed [[man]] should be cast headlong into that destruction;—if he did this, shall we say that that [[man]] has done a [[great]] thing for the eternal [[city]] who may have died by a like [[death]], not, however, precipitating himself spontaneously into a gulf, but having [[suffered]] this [[death]] at the hands of some [[enemy]] of his [[faith]], more especially when he has received from his [[lord]], who is also [[king]] of[pg 212] his [[country]], a more [[certain]] oracle, "fear not them who kill the [[body]], but cannot kill the [[soul]]?"[214] if the decii dedicated themselves to [[death]], consecrating themselves in a form of words, as it were, that falling, and pacifying by their [[blood]] the wrath of the gods, they might be the means of delivering the roman [[army]];—if they did this, let not the holy martyrs carry themselves proudly, as though they had done some meritorious thing for a share in that [[country]] where are eternal [[life]] and felicity, if even to the shedding of their [[blood]], loving not only the brethren [[brother]] for whom it was shed, but, according as had been commanded them, even their enemies [[enemy]] by whom it was being shed, they have vied with one another in [[faith]] of [[love]] and [[love]] of [[faith]]. if marcus pulvillus, when engaged in dedicating a temple to [[jupiter]], juno, and minerva, received with such indifference the false [[intelligence]] which was brought to him of the [[death]] of his [[son]], with the intention of so agitating him that he should go away, and thus the [[glory]] of dedicating the temple should fall to his colleague;—if he received that [[intelligence]] with such indifference that he even ordered that his [[son]] should be cast out unburied, the [[love]] of [[glory]] having overcome in his [[heart]] the [[grief]] of bereavement, how shall any one affirm that he has done a [[great]] thing for the preaching of the gospel, by which the [[citizens]] of the heavenly [[city]] are delivered from divers errors, and gathered together from divers wanderings, to whom his [[lord]] has said, when anxious about the burial of his [[father]], "follow me, and let the [[dead]] bury their [[dead]]?"[215] regulus, in order not to break his oath, even with his most cruel enemies [[enemy]], returned to them from [[rome]] itself, because (as he is said to have replied to the romans when they wished to retain him) he could not have the [[dignity]] of an honourable citizen at [[rome]] after having been a [[slave]] to the africans, and the carthaginians put him to [[death]] with the utmost tortures, because he had spoken against them in the senate. if regulus acted thus, what tortures are not to be despised for the sake of [[good]] [[faith]] toward that [[country]] to whose beatitude [[faith]] itself leads? or what will a [[man]] have rendered to the [[lord]] for all he has bestowed upon him, if, for the faithfulness he owes to him, he shall have[pg 213] [[suffered]] such things as regulus [[suffered]] at the hands of his most ruthless enemies [[enemy]] for the [[good]] [[faith]] which he owed to them? and how shall a [[christian]] dare vaunt himself of his voluntary [[poverty]], which he has chosen in order that during the pilgrimage of this [[life]] he may walk the more disencumbered on the way which leads to the [[country]] where the true riches [[rich]] are, even [[god]] himself;—how, i say, shall he vaunt himself for this, when he hears or reads that lucius valerius, who died when he was holding the office of consul, was so [[poor]] that his [[funeral]] expenses were paid with [[money]] collected by the [[people]]?—or when he hears that quintius cincinnatus, who, possessing only four acres of [[land]], and cultivating them with his own hands, was taken from the plough to be made dictator,—an office more honourable even than that of consul,—and that, after having won [[great]] [[glory]] by conquering the [[enemy]], he preferred notwithstanding to continue in his [[poverty]]? or how shall he boast of having done a [[great]] thing, who has not been prevailed upon by the offer of any [[reward]] of this [[world]] to renounce his connection with that heavenly and eternal [[country]], when he hears that fabricius could not be prevailed on to forsake the roman [[city]] by the [[great]] gifts offered to him by pyrrhus [[king]] of the epirots, who promised him the fourth part of his [[kingdom]], but preferred to abide there in his [[poverty]] as a private [[individual]]? for if, when their [[republic]],—that is, the interest of the [[people]], the interest of the [[country]], the [[common]] interest,—was most prosperous and wealthy, they themselves were so [[poor]] in their own houses, that one of them, who had already been twice a consul, was expelled from that senate of [[poor]] [[men]] by the censor, because he was discovered to possess ten pounds weight of silver-plate,—since, i say, those very [[men]] by whose triumphs the [[public]] treasury was enriched were so [[poor]], ought not all christians [[christian]], who make [[common]] [[property]] of their riches [[rich]] with a far nobler [[purpose]], even that (according to what is written in the acts of the apostles) they may distribute to each one according to his need, and that no one may say that anything is his own, but that all things may be their [[common]] possession,[216]—ought they not to [[understand]] that they should not vaunt themselves, because[pg 214] they do that to obtain the [[society]] of angels, when those [[men]] did well-nigh the same thing to preserve the [[glory]] of the romans?

how could these, and whatever like things are found in the roman [[history]], have become so widely known, and have been proclaimed by so [[great]] a fame, had not the roman [[empire]], extending far and wide, been raised to its greatness by magnificent successes? wherefore, through that [[empire]], so extensive and of so long continuance, so illustrious and glorious also through the virtues [[virtue]] of such [[great]] [[men]], the [[reward]] which they sought was rendered to their earnest aspirations, and also examples [[example]] are set before us, containing necessary admonition, in order that we may be stung with shame if we shall see that we have not held fast those virtues [[virtue]] for the sake of the most glorious [[city]] of [[god]], which are, in whatever way, resembled by those virtues [[virtue]] which they held fast for the sake of the [[glory]] of a terrestrial [[city]], and that, too, if we shall [[feel]] conscious that we have held them fast, we may not be lifted up with [[pride]], because, as the apostle says, "the sufferings of the [[present]] [[time]] are not worthy to be compared to the [[glory]] which shall be revealed in us."[217] but so far as regards [[human]] and temporal [[glory]], the lives [[life]] of these ancient romans were reckoned sufficiently worthy. therefore, also, we see, in the [[light]] of that [[truth]] which, veiled in the old testament, is revealed in the new, namely, that it is not in view of terrestrial and temporal benefits, which [[divine]] providence grants promiscuously to [[good]] and [[evil]], that [[god]] is to be worshipped, but in view of eternal [[life]], everlasting gifts, and of the [[society]] of the heavenly [[city]] itself;—in the [[light]] of this [[truth]] we see that the [[jews]] were most righteously given as a trophy to the [[glory]] of the romans; for we see that these romans, who rested on earthly [[glory]], and sought to obtain it by virtues [[virtue]], such as they were, conquered those who, in their [[great]] depravity, slew and rejected the giver of true [[glory]], and of the eternal [[city]].

19. concerning the difference between true [[glory]] and the [[desire]] of domination.

there is assuredly a difference between the [[desire]] of [[human]] [[glory]] and the [[desire]] of domination; for, though he who has[pg 215] an overweening delight in [[human]] [[glory]] will be also very prone to aspire earnestly after domination, nevertheless they who [[desire]] the true [[glory]] even of [[human]] [[praise]] strive not to displease those who [[judge]] well of them. for there are many [[good]] [[moral]] qualities, of which many are competent judges [[judge]], although they are not possessed by many; and by those [[good]] [[moral]] qualities those [[men]] press on to [[glory]], [[honour]], and domination, of whom sallust says, "but they press on by the true way."

but whosoever, without possessing that [[desire]] of [[glory]] which makes one [[fear]] to displease those who [[judge]] his conduct, desires [[desire]] domination and [[power]], very often seeks to obtain what he loves [[love]] by most open crimes. therefore he who desires [[desire]] [[glory]] presses on to obtain it either by the true way, or certainly by deceit and artifice, wishing to appear [[good]] when he is not. therefore to him who possesses virtues [[virtue]] it is a [[great]] [[virtue]] to despise [[glory]]; for contempt of it is seen by [[god]], but is not manifest to [[human]] [[judgment]]. for whatever any one does before the [[eyes]] of [[men]] in order to show himself to be a despiser of [[glory]], if they suspect that he is doing it in order to get greater [[praise]],—that is, greater [[glory]],—he has no means of demonstrating to the perceptions of those who suspect him that the case is really otherwise than they suspect it to be. but he who despises the [[judgment]] of praisers, despises also the rashness of suspectors. their salvation, indeed, he does not despise, if he is truly [[good]]; for so [[great]] is the [[righteousness]] of that [[man]] who receives his virtues [[virtue]] from the spirit of [[god]], that he loves [[love]] his very enemies [[enemy]], and so loves [[love]] them that he desires [[desire]] that his haters and detractors may be turned to [[righteousness]], and become his associates, and that not in an earthly but in a heavenly [[country]]. but with [[respect]] to his praisers, though he sets little value on their [[praise]], he does not set little value on their [[love]]; neither does he elude their [[praise]], lest he should forfeit their [[love]]. and, therefore, he strives earnestly to have their praises [[praise]] directed to him from whom every one receives whatever in him is truly praiseworthy. but he who is a despiser of [[glory]], but is greedy of domination, exceeds the beasts in the vices [[vice]] of [[cruelty]] and luxuriousness. such, indeed, were [[certain]] of the romans,[pg 216] who, wanting the [[love]] of esteem, wanted not the thirst for domination; and that there were many such, [[history]] testifies. but it was nero cæsar who was the first to reach the summit, and, as it were, the citadel, of this [[vice]]; for so [[great]] was his luxuriousness, that one would have [[thought]] there was nothing manly to be dreaded in him, and such his [[cruelty]], that, had not the contrary been known, no one would have [[thought]] there was anything effeminate in his [[character]]. nevertheless [[power]] and domination are not given even to such [[men]] save by the providence of the most high [[god]], when he judges [[judge]] that the [[state]] of [[human]] affairs is worthy of such lords [[lord]]. the [[divine]] utterance is clear on this matter; for the [[wisdom]] of [[god]] thus speaks: "by me kings [[king]] reign, and tyrants [[tyrant]] possess the [[land]]."[218] but, that it may not be [[thought]] that by "tyrants" is meant, not wicked and impious kings [[king]], but brave [[men]], in accordance with the ancient use of the word, as when [[virgil]] says,

"for [[know]] that treaty may not stand where [[king]] greets [[king]] and joins not hand,"[219]
in another place it is most unambiguously said of [[god]], that he "maketh the [[man]] who is an hypocrite to reign on account of the perversity of the [[people]]."[220] wherefore, though i have, according to my ability, shown for what [[reason]] [[god]], who alone is true and just, helped forward the romans, who were [[good]] according to a [[certain]] standard of an earthly [[state]], to the acquirement of the [[glory]] of so [[great]] an [[empire]], there may be, nevertheless, a more hidden cause, known [[better]] to [[god]] than to us, depending on the [[diversity]] of the merits [[merit]] of the [[human]] [[race]]. among all who are truly pious, it is at all events agreed that no one without true piety—that is, true [[worship]] of the true god—can have true [[virtue]]; and that it is not true [[virtue]] which is the [[slave]] of [[human]] [[praise]]. though, nevertheless, they who are not [[citizens]] of the eternal [[city]], which is called the [[city]] of [[god]] in the [[sacred]] scriptures [[scripture]], are more useful to the earthly [[city]] when they possess even that [[virtue]] than if they had not even that. but there could be nothing more fortunate for [[human]] affairs than that, by the [[mercy]] of [[god]], they who are endowed with true piety of [[life]], if they have the [[skill]] for ruling [[people]], should also have the[pg 217] [[power]]. but such [[men]], however [[great]] virtues [[virtue]] they may possess in this [[life]], attribute it solely to the grace of [[god]] that he has bestowed it on them—willing, believing, seeking. and, at the same [[time]], they [[understand]] how far they are short of that [[perfection]] of [[righteousness]] which exists in the [[society]] of those holy angels for which they are striving to fit themselves. but however much that [[virtue]] may be praised and cried up, which without true piety is the [[slave]] of [[human]] [[glory]], it is not at all to be compared even to the feeble beginnings of the [[virtue]] of the saints, whose [[hope]] is placed in the grace and [[mercy]] of the true [[god]].

20. that it is as shameful for the virtues [[virtue]] to serve [[human]] [[glory]] as bodily [[pleasure]].

philosophers,—who place the end of [[human]] [[good]] in [[virtue]] itself, in order to put to shame [[certain]] other [[philosophers]], who indeed approve of the virtues [[virtue]], but measure them all with reference to the end of bodily [[pleasure]], and [[think]] that this [[pleasure]] is to be sought for its own sake, but the virtues [[virtue]] on account of [[pleasure]],—are wont to paint a [[kind]] of word-picture, in which [[pleasure]] sits like a luxurious queen on a [[royal]] seat, and all the virtues [[virtue]] are subjected to her as slaves [[slave]], watching her nod, that they may do whatever she shall command. she commands prudence to be ever on the watch to discover how [[pleasure]] may [[rule]], and be safe. [[justice]] she orders to grant what benefits she can, in order to secure those friendships [[friendship]] which are necessary for bodily [[pleasure]]; to do [[wrong]] to no one, lest, on account of the breaking of the laws [[law]], [[pleasure]] be not able to [[live]] in security. fortitude she orders to keep her mistress, that is, [[pleasure]], bravely in her [[mind]], if any affliction befall her [[body]] which does not [[occasion]] [[death]], in order that by remembrance of former delights she may mitigate the poignancy of [[present]] [[pain]]. temperance she commands to take only a [[certain]] quantity even of the most favourite food, lest, through immoderate use, anything prove hurtful by disturbing the health of the [[body]], and thus [[pleasure]], which the epicureans make to consist chiefly in the health of the [[body]], be grievously offended. thus the virtues [[virtue]], with the whole [[dignity]] of their [[glory]], will be the slaves [[slave]] of [[pleasure]], as of some imperious and disreputable woman.

there is nothing, say our [[philosophers]], more disgraceful[pg 218] and monstrous than this picture, and which the [[eyes]] of [[good]] [[men]] can less endure. and they say the [[truth]]. but i do not [[think]] that the picture would be sufficiently becoming, even if it were made so that the virtues [[virtue]] should be represented as the slaves [[slave]] of [[human]] [[glory]]; for, though that [[glory]] be not a luxurious woman, it is nevertheless puffed up, and has much vanity in it. wherefore it is unworthy of the solidity and firmness of the virtues [[virtue]] to represent them as serving this [[glory]], so that prudence shall provide nothing, [[justice]] distribute nothing, temperance moderate nothing, except to the end that [[men]] may be pleased and vainglory served. nor will they be able to defend themselves from the charge of such baseness, whilst they, by way of being despisers of [[glory]], disregard the [[judgment]] of other [[men]], seem to themselves [[wise]], and please themselves. for their [[virtue]],—if, indeed, it is [[virtue]] at all,—is only in another way subjected to [[human]] [[praise]]; for he who seeks to please himself seeks still to please [[man]]. but he who, with true piety towards [[god]], whom he loves [[love]], believes [[belief]], and hopes [[hope]] in, fixes his attention more on those things in which he displeases himself, than on those things, if there are any such, which please himself, or rather, not himself, but the [[truth]], does not attribute that by which he can now please the [[truth]] to anything but to the [[mercy]] of him whom he has feared to displease, giving thanks for what in him is healed, and pouring out prayers for the healing of that which is yet unhealed.

21. that the roman dominion was granted by him from whom is all [[power]], and by whose providence all things are ruled.

these things being so, we do not attribute the [[power]] of giving kingdoms [[kingdom]] and empires to any save to the true [[god]], who gives [[happiness]] in the [[kingdom]] of [[heaven]] to the pious alone, but gives kingly [[power]] on [[earth]] both to the pious and the impious, as it may please him, whose [[good]] [[pleasure]] is always just. for though we have said something about the principles [[principle]] which guide his administration, in so far as it has seemed [[good]] to him to explain it, nevertheless it is too much for us, and far surpasses our [[strength]], to discuss the hidden things of men's hearts [[heart]], and by a clear examination to determine the merits [[merit]] of various kingdoms [[kingdom]]. he, therefore, who is[pg 219] the one true [[god]], who never leaves the [[human]] [[race]] without just [[judgment]] and [[help]], gave a [[kingdom]] to the romans when he would, and as [[great]] as he would, as he did also to the assyrians, and even the persians, by whom, as their own books [[book]] testify, only two gods are worshipped, the one [[good]] and the other [[evil]],—to say nothing concerning the [[hebrew]] [[people]], of whom i have already spoken as much as seemed necessary, who, as long as they were a [[kingdom]], worshipped none save the true [[god]]. the same, therefore, who gave to the persians harvests, though they did not [[worship]] the [[goddess]] segetia, who gave the other blessings of the [[earth]], though they did not [[worship]] the many gods which the romans supposed to preside, each one over some particular thing, or even many of them over each several thing,—he, i say, gave the persians dominion, though they worshipped none of those gods to whom the romans believed themselves indebted for the [[empire]]. and the same is true in [[respect]] of [[men]] as well as nations. he who gave [[power]] to marius gave it also to caius cæsar; he who gave it to augustus gave it also to nero; he also who gave it to the most benignant emperors [[emperor]], the vespasians, [[father]] and [[son]], gave it also to the cruel domitian; and, finally, to avoid the necessity of going over them all, he who gave it to the [[christian]] constantine gave it also to the apostate julian, whose gifted [[mind]] was deceived by a sacrilegious and detestable curiosity, stimulated by the [[love]] of [[power]]. and it was because he was addicted through curiosity to [[vain]] oracles, that, confident of [[victory]], he burned the ships which were laden with the provisions necessary for his [[army]], and therefore, engaging with hot zeal in rashly audacious enterprises, he was soon slain, as the just consequence of his recklessness, and left his [[army]] unprovisioned in an enemy's [[country]], and in such a predicament that it never could have escaped, save by altering the boundaries of the roman [[empire]], in violation of that omen of the [[god]] terminus of which i spoke in the preceding [[book]]; for the [[god]] terminus yielded to necessity, though he had not yielded to [[jupiter]]. manifestly these things are ruled and governed by the one [[god]] according as he pleases; and if his motives are hid, are they therefore [[unjust]]?

[pg 220]

22. the durations and issues of [[war]] depend on the will of [[god]].

thus also the durations of wars [[war]] are determined by him as he may see meet, according to his righteous will, and [[pleasure]], and [[mercy]], to afflict or to console the [[human]] [[race]], so that they are sometimes of longer, sometimes of shorter duration. the [[war]] of the pirates and the third punic [[war]] were terminated with incredible celerity. also the [[war]] of the fugitive gladiators, though in it many roman generals and the consuls were defeated, and [[italy]] was terribly wasted and ravaged, was nevertheless ended in the third year, having itself been, during its continuance, the end of much. the picentes, the marsi, and the peligni, not distant but italian nations, after a long and most [[loyal]] servitude under the roman yoke, attempted to raise their heads into [[liberty]], though many nations had now been subjected to the roman [[power]], and [[carthage]] had been overthrown. in this italian [[war]] the romans were very often defeated, and two consuls perished, besides other [[noble]] senators; nevertheless this calamity was not protracted over a long space of [[time]], for the fifth year put an end to it. but the second punic [[war]], lasting for the space of eighteen years, and occasioning the [[greatest]] disasters and calamities to the [[republic]], wore out and well-nigh consumed the [[strength]] of the romans; for in two battles [[battle]] about seventy thousand romans fell.[221] the first punic [[war]] was terminated after having been waged for three-and-twenty years. the mithridatic [[war]] was waged for forty years. and that no one may [[think]] that in the early and much belauded times [[time]] of the romans they were far braver and more able to bring wars [[war]] to a speedy termination, the samnite [[war]] was protracted for nearly fifty years; and in this [[war]] the romans were so beaten that they were even put under the yoke. but because they did not [[love]] [[glory]] for the sake of [[justice]], but seemed rather to have loved [[justice]] for the sake of [[glory]], they broke the [[peace]] and the treaty which had been concluded. these things i mention, because many, ignorant of [[past]] things, and some also dissimulating what they [[know]], if in [[christian]] times [[time]] they see any [[war]] protracted a little longer than they expected, straightway make a fierce and insolent attack on[pg 221] our [[religion]], exclaiming that, but for it, the deities would have been supplicated still, according to ancient rites; and then, by that bravery of the romans, which, with the [[help]] of [[mars]] and bellona, speedily brought to an end such [[great]] wars [[war]], this [[war]] also would be speedily terminated. let them, therefore, who have [[read]] [[history]] recollect what long-continued wars [[war]], having various issues and entailing woful slaughter, were waged by the ancient romans, in accordance with the general [[truth]] that the [[earth]], like the tempestuous deep, is [[subject]] to agitations from tempests—tempests of such evils [[evil]], in various degrees [[degree]],—and let them sometimes confess what they do not like to own, and not, by madly speaking against [[god]], [[destroy]] themselves and [[deceive]] the ignorant.

23. concerning the [[war]] in which radagaisus, [[king]] of the goths, a worshipper of demons, was conquered in one day, with all his mighty forces [[force]].

nevertheless they do not mention with thanksgiving what [[god]] has very recently, and within our own memory, wonderfully and mercifully done, but as far as in them lies [[lie]] they attempt, if possible, to bury it in universal oblivion. but should we be silent about these things, we should be in like manner ungrateful. when radagaisus, [[king]] of the goths, having taken up his position very near to the [[city]], with a vast and savage [[army]], was already close upon the romans, he was in one day so speedily and so thoroughly beaten, that, whilst not even one roman was wounded, much less slain, far more than a hundred thousand of his [[army]] were prostrated, and he himself and his sons [[son]], having been captured, were forthwith put to [[death]], suffering the [[punishment]] they deserved. for had so impious a [[man]], with so [[great]] and so impious a host, entered the [[city]], whom would he have spared? what tombs of the martyrs would he have respected? in his treatment of what [[person]] would he have manifested the [[fear]] of [[god]]? whose [[blood]] would he have refrained from shedding? whose chastity would he have wished to preserve inviolate? but how loud would they not have been in the praises [[praise]] of their gods! how insultingly they would have boasted, saying that radagaisus had conquered, that he had been able to achieve such [[great]] things, because he propitiated and won over the gods by daily sacrifices [[sacrifice]],—a thing which the [[christian]] religion[pg 222] did not allow the romans to do! for when he was approaching to those places where he was overwhelmed at the nod of the supreme majesty, as his fame was everywhere increasing, it was being told us at [[carthage]] that the pagans were believing, publishing, and boasting, that he, on account of the [[help]] and protection of the gods friendly to him, because of the sacrifices [[sacrifice]] which he was said to be daily offering to them, would certainly not be conquered by those who were not performing such sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to the roman gods, and did not even permit that they should be offered by any one. and now these wretched [[men]] do not give thanks to [[god]] for his [[great]] [[mercy]], who, having determined to chastise the [[corruption]] of [[men]], which was worthy of far heavier chastisement than the [[corruption]] of the barbarians, tempered his indignation with such mildness as, in the first instance, to cause that the [[king]] of the goths should be conquered in a wonderful manner, lest [[glory]] should accrue to demons, whom he was known to be supplicating, and thus the minds [[mind]] of the [[weak]] should be overthrown; and then, afterwards, to cause that, when [[rome]] was to be taken, it should be taken by those barbarians who, contrary to any custom of all former wars [[war]], protected, through reverence for the [[christian]] [[religion]], those who fled for refuge to the [[sacred]] places, and who so opposed the demons themselves, and the rites of impious sacrifices [[sacrifice]], that they seemed to be carrying on a far more terrible [[war]] with them than with [[men]]. thus did the true [[lord]] and governor of things both scourge the romans mercifully, and, by the marvellous defeat of the worshippers of demons, show that those sacrifices [[sacrifice]] were not necessary even for the safety of [[present]] things; so that, by those who do not obstinately hold out, but prudently consider the matter, true [[religion]] may not be deserted on account of the urgencies of the [[present]] [[time]], but may be more clung to in most confident expectation of eternal [[life]].

24. what was the [[happiness]] of the [[christian]] emperors [[emperor]], and how far it was true [[happiness]].

for neither do we say that [[certain]] [[christian]] emperors [[emperor]] were therefore [[happy]] because they ruled a long [[time]], or, dying a peaceful [[death]], left their sons [[son]] to succeed them in the [[empire]],[pg 223] or subdued the enemies [[enemy]] of the [[republic]], or were able both to guard against and to suppress the attempt of hostile [[citizens]] rising against them. these and other gifts or comforts of this sorrowful [[life]] even [[certain]] worshippers of demons have merited to receive, who do not belong to the [[kingdom]] of [[god]] to which these belong; and this is to be traced to the [[mercy]] of [[god]], who would not have those who [[believe]] in him [[desire]] such things as the highest [[good]]. but we say that they are [[happy]] if they [[rule]] justly; if they are not lifted up amid the praises [[praise]] of those who [[pay]] them sublime honours [[honour]], and the obsequiousness of those who salute them with an excessive [[humility]], but [[remember]] that they are [[men]]; if they make their [[power]] the handmaid of his majesty by using it for the [[greatest]] possible extension of his [[worship]]; if they [[fear]], [[love]], [[worship]] [[god]]; if more than their own they [[love]] that [[kingdom]] in which they are not afraid to have partners; if they are slow to punish, ready to pardon; if they apply that [[punishment]] as necessary to [[government]] and defence of the [[republic]], and not in order to gratify their own enmity; if they grant pardon, not that [[iniquity]] may go unpunished, but with the [[hope]] that the transgressor may amend his ways; if they compensate with the lenity of [[mercy]] and the liberality of benevolence for whatever severity they may be compelled to decree; if their luxury is as much restrained as it might have been unrestrained; if they prefer to govern depraved desires [[desire]] rather than any nation whatever; and if they do all these things, not through ardent [[desire]] of empty [[glory]], but through [[love]] of eternal felicity, not neglecting to offer to the true [[god]], who is their [[god]], for their sins [[sin]], the sacrifices [[sacrifice]] of [[humility]], contrition, and prayer. such [[christian]] emperors [[emperor]], we say, are [[happy]] in the [[present]] [[time]] by [[hope]], and are destined to be so in the enjoyment of the reality itself, when that which we wait for shall have arrived.

25. concerning the [[prosperity]] which [[god]] granted to the [[christian]] [[emperor]] constantine.

for the [[good]] [[god]], lest [[men]], who [[believe]] that he is to be worshipped with a view to eternal [[life]], should [[think]] that no one could attain to all this high estate, and to this terrestrial dominion, unless he should be a worshipper of the demons,—supposing[pg 224] that these spirits have [[great]] [[power]] with [[respect]] to such things,—for this [[reason]] he gave to the [[emperor]] constantine, who was not a worshipper of demons, but of the true [[god]] himself, such fulness of earthly gifts as no one would even dare [[wish]] for. to him also he granted the [[honour]] of founding a [[city]],[222] a companion to the roman [[empire]], the [[daughter]], as it were, of [[rome]] itself, but without any temple or image of the demons. he reigned for a long period as sole [[emperor]], and unaided held and defended the whole roman [[world]]. in conducting and carrying on wars [[war]] he was most victorious; in overthrowing tyrants [[tyrant]] he was most successful. he died at a [[great]] [[age]], of sickness and old [[age]], and left his sons [[son]] to succeed him in the [[empire]].[223] but again, lest any [[emperor]] should become a [[christian]] in order to [[merit]] the [[happiness]] of constantine, when every one should be a [[christian]] for the sake of eternal [[life]], [[god]] took away jovian far sooner than julian, and permitted that gratian should be slain by the [[sword]] of a [[tyrant]]. but in his case there was far more mitigation of the calamity than in the case of the [[great]] pompey, for he could not be avenged by cato, whom he had left, as it were, heir to the civil [[war]]. but gratian, though pious minds [[mind]] require not such consolations, was avenged by theodosius, whom he had associated with himself in the [[empire]], though he had a little [[brother]] of his own, being more desirous of a faithful [[alliance]] than of extensive [[power]].

26. on the [[faith]] and piety of theodosius augustus.

and on this account, theodosius not only preserved during the lifetime of gratian that fidelity which was due to him, but also, after his [[death]], he, like a true [[christian]], took his little [[brother]] valentinian under his protection, as joint [[emperor]], after he had been expelled by maximus, the murderer of his [[father]]. he guarded him with paternal affection, though he might without any difficulty have got rid of him, being entirely destitute of all resources, had he been animated with the [[desire]] of extensive [[empire]], and not with the [[ambition]] of being a benefactor. it was therefore a far greater [[pleasure]] to him, when he had adopted the boy, and preserved to him his[pg 225] imperial [[dignity]], to console him by his very [[humanity]] and [[kindness]]. afterwards, when that [[success]] was rendering maximus terrible, theodosius, in the midst of his perplexing anxieties, was not drawn away to [[follow]] the suggestions of a sacrilegious and unlawful curiosity, but sent to john, whose abode was in the desert of [[egypt]],—for he had learned that this servant of [[god]] (whose fame was spreading abroad) was endowed with the gift of prophecy,—and from him he received assurance of [[victory]]. immediately the slayer of the [[tyrant]] maximus, with the deepest feelings of compassion and [[respect]], restored the boy valentinianus to his share in the [[empire]] from which he had been driven. valentinianus being soon after slain by secret assassination, or by some other plot or accident, theodosius, having again received a response from the [[prophet]], and placing entire confidence in it, marched against the [[tyrant]] eugenius, who had been unlawfully elected to succeed that [[emperor]], and defeated his very powerful [[army]], more by prayer than by the [[sword]]. some soldiers who were at the [[battle]] reported to me that all the missiles they were throwing were snatched from their hands by a vehement wind, which blew from the direction of theodosius' [[army]] upon the [[enemy]]; nor did it only drive with greater velocity the darts which were hurled against them, but also turned back upon their own bodies [[body]] the darts which they themselves were throwing. and therefore the poet claudian, although an alien from the name of [[christ]], nevertheless says in his praises [[praise]] of him, "o [[prince]], too much beloved by [[god]], for thee æolus pours armed tempests from their caves; for thee the air fights, and the winds with one accord obey thy bugles."[224] but the victor, as he had believed and predicted, overthrew the statues of [[jupiter]], which had been, as it were, consecrated by i [[know]] not what [[kind]] of rites against him, and set up in the alps. and the thunderbolts of these statues, which were made of gold, he mirthfully and graciously presented to his couriers, who (as the joy of the [[occasion]] permitted) were jocularly saying that they would be most [[happy]] to be struck by such thunderbolts. the sons [[son]] of his own enemies [[enemy]], whose fathers [[father]] had been slain not so much by his orders as by the vehemence of [[war]], having[pg 226] fled for refuge to a [[church]], though they were not yet christians [[christian]], he was anxious, taking advantage of the [[occasion]], to bring over to [[christianity]], and treated them with [[christian]] [[love]]. nor did he deprive them of their [[property]], but, besides allowing them to retain it, bestowed on them additional honours [[honour]]. he did not permit private animosities to affect the treatment of any [[man]] after the [[war]]. he was not like cinna, and marius, and sylla, and other such [[men]], who wished not to finish civil wars [[war]] even when they were finished, but rather [[grieved]] that they had arisen at all, than wished that when they were finished they should harm any one. amid all these events, from the very commencement of his reign, he did not cease to [[help]] the troubled [[church]] against the impious by most just and merciful laws [[law]], which the heretical valens, favouring the arians, had vehemently afflicted. indeed, he rejoiced more to be a member of this [[church]] than he did to be a [[king]] upon the [[earth]]. the idols of the gentiles he everywhere ordered to be overthrown, understanding well that not even terrestrial gifts are placed in the [[power]] of demons, but in that of the true [[god]]. and what could be more admirable than his [[religious]] [[humility]], when, compelled by the urgency of [[certain]] of his intimates, he avenged the grievous crime of the thessalonians, which at the prayer of the bishops he had promised to pardon, and, being laid hold of by the discipline of the [[church]], did penance in such a way that the sight of his imperial loftiness prostrated made the [[people]] who were interceding for him weep more than the [[consciousness]] of offence had made them [[fear]] it when enraged? these and other similar [[good]] works [[work]], which it would be long to tell, he carried with him from this [[world]] of [[time]], where the [[greatest]] [[human]] nobility and loftiness are but vapour. of these works [[work]] the [[reward]] is eternal [[happiness]], of which [[god]] is the giver, though only to those who are sincerely pious. but all other blessings and privileges [[privilege]] of this [[life]], as the [[world]] itself, [[light]], air, [[earth]], water, fruits, and the [[soul]] of [[man]] himself, his [[body]], senses, [[mind]], [[life]], he lavishes on [[good]] and [[bad]] alike. and among these blessings is also to be reckoned the possession of an [[empire]], whose extent he regulates according to the requirements of his providential [[government]] at various times [[time]]. whence, i see, we must now [[answer]] those who, being confuted[pg 227] and convicted by the most manifest proofs, by which it is shown that for obtaining these terrestrial things, which are all the foolish [[desire]] to have, that multitude of false gods is of no use, attempt to assert that the gods are to be worshipped with a view to the interest, not of the [[present]] [[life]], but of that which is to come after [[death]]. for as to those who, for the sake of the [[friendship]] of this [[world]], are willing to [[worship]] vanities, and do not grieve that they are left to their puerile understandings, i [[think]] they have been sufficiently answered in these five books [[book]]; of which books [[book]], when i had published the first three, and they had begun to come into the hands of many, i heard that [[certain]] persons [[person]] were preparing against them an [[answer]] of some [[kind]] or other in writing. then it was told me that they had already written their [[answer]], but were waiting a [[time]] when they could publish it without danger. such persons [[person]] i would advise not to [[desire]] what cannot be of any advantage to them; for it is very easy for a [[man]] to seem to himself to have answered arguments, when he has only been unwilling to be silent. for what is more loquacious than vanity? and though it be able, if it like, to shout more loudly than the [[truth]], it is not, for all that, more powerful than the [[truth]]. but let [[men]] consider diligently all the things that we have said, and if, perchance, judging without party spirit, they shall clearly perceive that they are such things as may rather be shaken than torn up by their most impudent garrulity, and, as it were, satirical and mimic levity, let them restrain their absurdities, and let them choose rather to be corrected by the [[wise]] than to be lauded by the foolish. for if they are waiting an opportunity, not for [[liberty]] to speak the [[truth]], but for licence to revile, may not that befall them which tully says concerning some one, "oh, wretched man! who was at [[liberty]] to [[sin]]?"[225] wherefore, whoever he be who deems himself [[happy]] because of licence to revile, he would be far happier if that were not allowed him at all; for he might all the while, laying aside empty boast, be contradicting those to whose views he is opposed by way of [[free]] consultation with them, and be listening, as it becomes him, honourably, gravely, candidly, to all that can be adduced by those whom he consults by friendly disputation.

[pg 228]

book sixth.

argument.

hitherto the argument has been conducted against those who [[believe]] that the gods are to be worshipped for the sake of temporal advantages, now it is directed against those who [[believe]] that they are to be worshipped for the sake of eternal [[life]]. augustine devotes the five following books [[book]] to the confutation of this latter [[belief]], and first of all shows how mean an [[opinion]] of the gods was held by varro himself, the most esteemed writer on heathen theology. of this theology augustine adopts varro's division into three kinds [[kind]], mythical, [[natural]], and civil; and at once demonstrates that neither the mythical nor the civil can contribute anything to the [[happiness]] of the future [[life]].

preface.

in the five former books [[book]], i [[think]] i have sufficiently disputed against those who [[believe]] that the many false gods, which the [[christian]] [[truth]] shows to be useless images, or unclean spirits and pernicious demons, or certainly creatures, not the creator, are to be worshipped for the advantage of this mortal [[life]], and of terrestrial affairs, with that rite and service which the greeks [[greek]] call λατρεία, and which is due to the one true [[god]]. and who does not [[know]] that, in the face of excessive stupidity and obstinacy, neither these five nor any other number of books [[book]] whatsoever could be enough, when it is esteemed the [[glory]] of vanity to yield to no amount of [[strength]] on the side of [[truth]],—certainly to his destruction over whom so heinous a [[vice]] tyrannizes? for, notwithstanding all the assiduity of the physician who attempts to effect a cure, the disease remains unconquered, not through any [[fault]] of his, but because of the incurableness of the sick [[man]]. but those who thoroughly weigh the things which they [[read]], having understood and considered them, without any, or with no [[great]] and excessive [[degree]] of that obstinacy which belongs to a long-cherished error, will more readily [[judge]] that, in the five books [[book]] already finished, we have done more than the necessity[pg 229] of the [[question]] demanded, than that we have given it less discussion than it required. and they cannot have doubted but that all the [[hatred]] which the ignorant attempt to bring upon the [[christian]] [[religion]] on account of the disasters of this [[life]], and the destruction and [[change]] which befall terrestrial things, whilst the learned do not merely dissimulate, but encourage that [[hatred]], contrary to their own consciences, being possessed by a mad impiety;—they cannot have doubted, i say, but that this [[hatred]] is devoid of [[right]] reflection and [[reason]], and full of most [[light]] temerity, and most pernicious animosity.

1. of those who maintain that they [[worship]] the gods not for the sake of temporal, but eternal advantages.

now, as, in the next place (as the promised order demands), those are to be refuted and taught who contend that the gods of the nations, which the [[christian]] [[truth]] destroys, are to be worshipped not on account of this [[life]], but on account of that which is to be after [[death]], i shall do well to commence my disputation with the truthful oracle of the holy psalm, "blessed is the [[man]] whose [[hope]] is the [[lord]] [[god]], and who respecteth not vanities and lying follies."[226] nevertheless, in all vanities and lying follies the [[philosophers]] are to be listened to with far more toleration, who have repudiated those opinions [[opinion]] and errors of the [[people]]; for the [[people]] set up images to the deities, and either feigned concerning those whom they call [[immortal]] gods many false and unworthy things, or believed them, already feigned, and, when believed, mixed them up with their [[worship]] and [[sacred]] rites.

with those [[men]] who, though not by [[free]] avowal of their convictions, do still testify that they disapprove of those things by their muttering disapprobation during disputations on the [[subject]], it may not be very far amiss to discuss the following [[question]]: whether, for the sake of the [[life]] which is to be after [[death]], we ought to [[worship]], not the one [[god]], who made all creatures [[spiritual]] and corporeal, but those many gods who, as some of these [[philosophers]] hold, were made by that one [[god]], and placed by him in their respective sublime spheres, and are therefore considered more excellent and more [[noble]] than all the others?[227] but who will assert that it must be affirmed and[pg 230] contended that those gods, [[certain]] of whom i have mentioned in the fourth [[book]],[228] to whom are distributed, each to each, the charges of minute things, do bestow eternal [[life]]? but will those most skilled and most acute [[men]], who [[glory]] in having written for the [[great]] benefit of [[men]], to [[teach]] on what account each [[god]] is to be worshipped, and what is to be sought from each, lest with most disgraceful absurdity, such as a mimic is wont for the sake of merriment to exhibit, water should be sought from liber, wine from the lymphs,—will those [[men]] indeed affirm to any [[man]] supplicating the [[immortal]] gods, that when he shall have [[asked]] wine from the lymphs, and they shall have answered him, "we have water, seek wine from liber," he may rightly say, "if ye have not wine, at least give me eternal [[life]]?" what more monstrous than this absurdity? will not these lymphs,—for they are wont to be very easily made laugh,[229]—laughing loudly (if they do not attempt to [[deceive]] like demons), [[answer]] the suppliant, "o [[man]], dost thou [[think]] that we have [[life]] (vitam) in our [[power]], who thou hearest have not even the vine (vitem)?" it is therefore most impudent folly to seek and [[hope]] for eternal [[life]] from such gods as are asserted so to preside over the separate minute concernments of this most sorrowful and short [[life]], and whatever is useful for supporting and propping it, as that if anything which is under the [[care]] and [[power]] of one be sought from another, it is so incongruous and absurd that it appears very like to mimic drollery,—which, when it is done by mimics knowing what they are doing, is deservedly laughed at in the theatre, but when it is done by foolish persons [[person]], who do not [[know]] [[better]], is more deservedly ridiculed in the [[world]]. wherefore, as concerns those gods which the states have established, it has been cleverly [[invented]] and handed down to memory by learned [[men]], what [[god]] or [[goddess]] is to be supplicated in relation to every particular thing,—what, for instance, is to be sought from liber, what from the lymphs, what from vulcan, and so of all the rest, some of whom i have mentioned in the fourth [[book]], and some i have [[thought]] [[right]] to omit. further, if it is an error to seek wine from ceres, bread from liber, water from vulcan, [[fire]] from the[pg 231] lymphs, how much greater absurdity ought it to be [[thought]], if supplication be made to any one of these for eternal [[life]]?

wherefore, if, when we were inquiring what gods or goddesses [[goddess]] are to be believed to be able to confer earthly kingdoms [[kingdom]] upon [[men]], all things having been discussed, it was shown to be very far from the [[truth]] to [[think]] that even terrestrial kingdoms [[kingdom]] are established by any of those many false deities, is it not most insane impiety to [[believe]] that eternal [[life]], which is, without any [[doubt]] or comparison, to be preferred to all terrestrial kingdoms [[kingdom]], can be given to any one by any of these gods? for the [[reason]] why such gods seemed to us not to be able to give even an earthly [[kingdom]], was not because they are very [[great]] and exalted, whilst that is something small and abject, which they, in their so [[great]] sublimity, would not condescend to [[care]] for, but because, however deservedly any one may, in consideration of [[human]] frailty, despise the falling pinnacles of an earthly [[kingdom]], these gods have presented such an appearance as to seem most unworthy to have the granting and preserving of even those entrusted to them; and consequently, if (as we have taught in the two [[last]] books [[book]] of our [[work]], where this matter is treated of) no [[god]] out of all that crowd, either belonging to, as it were, the plebeian or to the [[noble]] gods, is fit to give mortal kingdoms [[kingdom]] to mortals, how much less is he able to make immortals [[immortal]] of mortals?

and more than this, if, according to the [[opinion]] of those with whom we are now arguing, the gods are to be worshipped, not on account of the [[present]] [[life]], but of that which is to be after [[death]], then, certainly, they are not to be worshipped on account of those particular things which are distributed and portioned out (not by any [[law]] of [[rational]] [[truth]], but by mere [[vain]] conjecture) to the [[power]] of such gods, as they [[believe]] they ought to be worshipped, who contend that their [[worship]] is necessary for all the desirable things of this mortal [[life]], against whom i have disputed sufficiently, as far as i was able, in the five preceding books [[book]]. these things being so, if the [[age]] itself of those who worshipped the [[goddess]] juventas should be characterized by remarkable vigour, whilst her despisers should either [[die]] within the years of [[youth]], or should, during that period, grow cold as with the torpor of old [[age]]; if bearded fortuna should[pg 232] cover the cheeks of her worshippers more handsomely and more gracefully than all others, whilst we should see those by whom she was despised either altogether beardless or ill-bearded; even then we should most rightly say, that thus far these several gods had [[power]], limited in some way by their functions, and that, consequently, neither ought eternal [[life]] to be sought from juventas, who could not give a beard, nor ought any [[good]] thing after this [[life]] to be expected from fortuna barbata, who has no [[power]] even in this [[life]] to give the [[age]] itself at which the beard grows. but now, when their [[worship]] is necessary not even on account of those very things which they [[think]] are subjected to their [[power]],—for many worshippers of the [[goddess]] juventas have not been at all vigorous at that [[age]], and many who do not [[worship]] her rejoice in youthful [[strength]]; and also many suppliants of fortuna barbata have either not been able to attain to any beard at all, not even an ugly one, although they who adore her in order to obtain a beard are ridiculed by her bearded despisers,—is the [[human]] [[heart]] really so foolish as to [[believe]] that that [[worship]] of the gods, which it acknowledges to be [[vain]] and ridiculous with [[respect]] to those very temporal and swiftly passing gifts, over each of which one of these gods is said to preside, is fruitful in results with [[respect]] to eternal [[life]]? and that they are able to give eternal [[life]] has not been affirmed even by those who, that they might be worshipped by the silly populace, distributed in minute division among them these temporal occupations, that none of them might sit idle; for they had supposed the existence of an exceedingly [[great]] number.

2. what we are to [[believe]] that varro [[thought]] concerning the gods of the nations, whose various kinds [[kind]] and [[sacred]] rites he has shown to be such that he would have acted more reverently towards them had he been altogether silent concerning them.

who has investigated those things more carefully than marcus varro? who has discovered them more learnedly? who has considered them more attentively? who has distinguished them more acutely? who has written about them more diligently and more fully?—who, though he is less pleasing in his eloquence, is nevertheless so full of instruction and [[wisdom]], that in all the erudition which we call[pg 233] secular, but they liberal, he will [[teach]] the student of things as much as cicero delights the student of words. and even tully himself renders him such testimony, as to say in his academic books [[book]] that he had held that disputation which is there carried on with marcus varro, "a [[man]]," he adds, "unquestionably the acutest of all [[men]], and, without any [[doubt]], the most learned."[230] he does not say the most eloquent or the most fluent, for in reality he was very deficient in this faculty, but he says, "of all [[men]] the most acute." and in those books [[book]],—that is, the academic,—where he contends that all things are to be doubted, he adds of him, "without any [[doubt]] the most learned." in [[truth]], he was so [[certain]] concerning this thing, that he laid aside that [[doubt]] which he is wont to have recourse to in all things, as if, when about to dispute in favour of the [[doubt]] of the academics, he had, with [[respect]] to this one thing, forgotten that he was an academic. but in the first [[book]], when he extols the literary works [[work]] of the same varro, he says, "us straying and wandering in our own [[city]] like strangers, thy books [[book]], as it were, brought [[home]], that at length we might come to [[know]] of who we were and where we were. thou hast opened up to us the [[age]] of the [[country]], the distribution of seasons, the laws [[law]] of [[sacred]] things, and of the priests [[priest]]; thou hast opened up to us domestic and [[public]] discipline; thou hast pointed out to us the proper places for [[religious]] ceremonies [[ceremony]], and hast informed us concerning [[sacred]] places. thou hast shown us the names, kinds [[kind]], offices, causes of all [[divine]] and [[human]] things."[231]

this [[man]], then, of so distinguished and excellent acquirements, and, as terentian briefly says of him in a most elegant verse,

"varro, a [[man]] universally informed,"[232]
who [[read]] so much that we wonder when he had [[time]] to write, wrote so much that we can scarcely [[believe]] any one could have [[read]] it all,—this [[man]], i say, so [[great]] in talent, so [[great]] in[pg 234] learning, had he been an opposer and destroyer of the so-called [[divine]] things of which he wrote, and had he said that they pertained to superstition rather than to [[religion]], might perhaps, even in that case, not have written so many things which are ridiculous, contemptible, detestable. but when he so worshipped these same gods, and so vindicated their [[worship]], as to say, in that same literary [[work]] of his, that he was afraid lest they should perish, not by an assault by enemies [[enemy]], but by the negligence of the [[citizens]], and that from this ignominy they are being delivered by him, and are being laid up and preserved in the memory of the [[good]] by means of such books [[book]], with a zeal far more beneficial than that through which metellus is declared to have rescued the [[sacred]] things of vesta from the flames, and æneas to have rescued the penates from the burning of troy; and when he, nevertheless, gives forth such things to be [[read]] by succeeding ages [[age]] as are deservedly judged by [[wise]] and unwise to be unfit to be [[read]], and to be most hostile to the [[truth]] of [[religion]]; what ought we to [[think]] but that a most acute and learned [[man]],—not, however, made [[free]] by the holy spirit,—was overpowered by the custom and laws [[law]] of his [[state]], and, not being able to be silent about those things by which he was influenced, spoke of them under pretence of commending [[religion]]?

3. varro's distribution of his [[book]] which he composed concerning the antiquities of [[human]] and [[divine]] things.

he wrote forty-one books [[book]] of antiquities. these he divided into [[human]] and [[divine]] things. twenty-five he devoted to [[human]] things, sixteen to [[divine]] things; following this plan in that division,—namely, to give six books [[book]] to each of the four divisions of [[human]] things. for he directs his attention to these considerations: who perform, where they perform, when they perform, what they perform. therefore in the first six books [[book]] he wrote concerning [[men]]; in the second six, concerning places; in the third six, concerning times [[time]]; in the fourth and [[last]] six, concerning things. four times [[time]] six, however, make only twenty-four. but he placed at the head of them one separate [[work]], which spoke of all these things conjointly.

in [[divine]] things, the same order he preserved throughout, as far as concerns those things which are performed to the[pg 235] gods. for [[sacred]] things are performed by [[men]] in places and times [[time]]. these four things i have mentioned he embraced in twelve books [[book]], allotting three to each. for he wrote the first three concerning [[men]], the following three concerning places, the third three concerning times [[time]], and the fourth three concerning [[sacred]] rites,—showing who should perform, where they should perform, when they should perform, what they should perform, with most subtle distinction. but because it was necessary to say—and that especially was expected—to whom they should perform [[sacred]] rites, he wrote concerning the gods themselves the [[last]] three books [[book]]; and these five times [[time]] three made fifteen. but they are in all, as we have said, sixteen. for he put also at the beginning of these one distinct [[book]], speaking by way of introduction of all which follows; which being finished, he proceeded to subdivide the first three in that fivefold distribution which pertain to [[men]], making the first concerning high priests [[priest]], the second concerning augurs, the third concerning the fifteen [[men]] presiding over the [[sacred]] ceremonies [[ceremony]].[233] the second three he made concerning places, speaking in one of them concerning their chapels, in the second concerning their temples, and in the third concerning [[religious]] places. the next three which [[follow]] these, and pertain to times [[time]],—that is, to festival days,—he distributed so as to make one concerning holidays, the other concerning the circus games, and the third concerning scenic plays. of the fourth three, pertaining to [[sacred]] things, he devoted one to consecrations, another to private, the [[last]] to [[public]], [[sacred]] rites. in the three which remain, the gods themselves [[follow]] this pompous train, as it were, for whom all this [[culture]] has been expended. in the first [[book]] are the [[certain]] gods, in the second the uncertain, in the third, and [[last]] of all, the [[chief]] and select gods.

4. that from the disputation of varro, it follows that the worshippers of the gods regard [[human]] things as more ancient than [[divine]] things.

in this whole series of most beautiful and most subtle distributions[pg 236] and distinctions, it will most easily appear evident from the things we have said already, and from what is to be said hereafter, to any [[man]] who is not, in the obstinacy of his [[heart]], an [[enemy]] to himself, that it is [[vain]] to seek and to [[hope]] for, and even most impudent to [[wish]] for eternal [[life]]. for these [[institutions]] are either the [[work]] of [[men]], or of demons,—not of those whom they call [[good]] demons, but, to speak more plainly, of unclean, and, without controversy, malign spirits, who with wonderful slyness and secretness suggest to the thoughts [[thought]] of the impious, and sometimes openly [[present]] to their understandings, noxious opinions [[opinion]], by which the [[human]] [[mind]] grows more and more foolish, and becomes unable to adapt itself to and abide in the immutable and eternal [[truth]], and seek to confirm these opinions [[opinion]] by every [[kind]] of fallacious attestation in their [[power]]. this very same varro testifies that he wrote first concerning [[human]] things, but afterwards concerning [[divine]] things, because the states existed first, and afterward these things were instituted by them. but the true [[religion]] was not instituted by any earthly [[state]], but plainly it established the celestial [[city]]. it, however, is inspired and taught by the true [[god]], the giver of eternal [[life]] to his true worshippers.

the following is the [[reason]] varro gives when he confesses that he had written first concerning [[human]] things, and afterwards of [[divine]] things, because these [[divine]] things were instituted by [[men]]:—"as the painter is before the painted tablet, the mason before the edifice, so states are before those things which are instituted by states." but he says that he would have written first concerning the gods, afterwards concerning [[men]], if he had been writing concerning the whole [[nature]] of the gods,—as if he were really writing concerning some portion of, and not all, the [[nature]] of the gods; or as if, indeed, some portion of, though not all, the [[nature]] of the gods ought not to be put before that of [[men]]. how, then, comes it that in those three [[last]] books [[book]], when he is diligently explaining the [[certain]], uncertain, and select gods, he seems to pass over no portion of the [[nature]] of the gods? why, then, does he say, "if we had been writing on the whole [[nature]] of the gods, we would first have finished the [[divine]] things before we[pg 237] touched the [[human]]?" for he either writes concerning the whole [[nature]] of the gods, or concerning some portion of it, or concerning no part of it at all. if concerning it all, it is certainly to be put before [[human]] things; if concerning some part of it, why should it not, from the very [[nature]] of the case, precede [[human]] things? is not even some part of the gods to be preferred to the whole of [[humanity]]? but if it is too much to prefer a part of the [[divine]] to all [[human]] things, that part is certainly worthy to be preferred to the romans at least. for he writes the books [[book]] concerning [[human]] things, not with reference to the whole [[world]], but only to [[rome]]; which books [[book]] he says he had properly placed, in the order of writing, before the books [[book]] on [[divine]] things, like a painter before the painted tablet, or a mason before the building, most openly confessing that, as a picture or a structure, even these [[divine]] things were instituted by [[men]]. there remains only the third supposition, that he is to be understood to have written concerning no [[divine]] [[nature]], but that he did not [[wish]] to say this openly, but left it to the [[intelligent]] to infer; for when one says "not all," usage understands that to mean "some," but it may be understood as meaning none, because that which is none is neither all nor some. in [[fact]], as he himself says, if he had been writing concerning all the [[nature]] of the gods, its due place would have been before [[human]] things in the order of writing. but, as the [[truth]] declares, even though varro is silent, the [[divine]] [[nature]] should have taken precedence of roman things, though it were not all, but only some. but it is properly put after, therefore it is none. his arrangement, therefore, was due, not to a [[desire]] to give [[human]] things priority to [[divine]] things, but to his unwillingness to prefer false things to true. for in what he wrote on [[human]] things, he followed the [[history]] of affairs; but in what he wrote concerning those things which they call [[divine]], what else did he [[follow]] but mere conjectures about [[vain]] things? this, doubtless, is what, in a subtle manner, he wished to signify; not only writing concerning [[divine]] things after the [[human]], but even giving a [[reason]] why he did so; for if he had suppressed this, some, perchance, would have defended his doing so in one way, and some in another. but in that very [[reason]] he has rendered,[pg 238] he has left nothing for [[men]] to conjecture at will, and has sufficiently proved that he preferred [[men]] to the [[institutions]] of [[men]], not the [[nature]] of [[men]] to the [[nature]] of the gods. thus he confessed that, in writing the books [[book]] concerning [[divine]] things, he did not write concerning the [[truth]] which belongs to [[nature]], but the falseness which belongs to error; which he has elsewhere expressed more openly (as i have mentioned in the fourth book[234]), saying that, had he been founding a new [[city]] himself, he would have written according to the order of [[nature]]; but as he had only found an old one, he could not but [[follow]] its custom.

5. concerning the three kinds [[kind]] of theology according to varro, namely, one fabulous, the other [[natural]], the third civil.

now what are we to say of this proposition of his, namely, that there are three kinds [[kind]] of theology, that is, of the account which is given of the gods; and of these, the one is called mythical, the other physical, and the third civil? did the latin usage permit, we should call the [[kind]] which he has placed first in order fabular,[235] but let us call it fabulous,[236] for mythical is derived from the [[greek]] μῦθος, a fable; but that the second should be called [[natural]], the usage of [[speech]] now admits; the third he himself has designated in latin, calling it civil.[237] then he says, "they call that [[kind]] mythical which the poets chiefly use; physical, that which the [[philosophers]] use; civil, that which the [[people]] use. as to the first i have mentioned," says he, "in it are many fictions, which are contrary to the [[dignity]] and [[nature]] of the immortals [[immortal]]. for we find in it that one [[god]] has been born from the head, another from the thigh, another from drops of [[blood]]; also, in this we find that gods have stolen, committed adultery, served [[men]]; in a word, in this all manner of things are attributed to the gods, such as may befall, not merely any [[man]], but even the most contemptible [[man]]." he certainly, where he could, where he dared, where he [[thought]] he could do it with impunity, has manifested, without any of the haziness of ambiguity, how [[great]] injury was done to the [[nature]] of the gods by lying fables; for he was speaking, not concerning [[natural]] theology, not concerning civil, but concerning[pg 239] fabulous theology, which he [[thought]] he could freely find [[fault]] with.

let us see, now, what he says concerning the second [[kind]]. "the second [[kind]] which i have explained," he says, "is that concerning which [[philosophers]] have left many books [[book]], in which they treat such questions [[question]] as these: what gods there are, where they are, of what [[kind]] and [[character]] they are, since what [[time]] they have existed, or if they have existed from eternity; whether they are of [[fire]], as heraclitus believes [[belief]]; or of number, as pythagoras; or of atoms, as epicurus says; and other such things, which men's ears can more easily hear inside the walls of a school than outside in the forum." he finds [[fault]] with nothing in this [[kind]] of theology which they call physical, and which belongs to [[philosophers]], except that he has related their controversies among themselves, through which there has arisen a multitude of dissentient sects. nevertheless he has removed this [[kind]] from the forum, that is, from the populace, but he has shut it up in schools. but that first [[kind]], most false and most base, he has not removed from the [[citizens]]. oh, the [[religious]] ears of the [[people]], and among them even those of the romans, that are not able to bear what the [[philosophers]] dispute concerning the gods! but when the poets sing and stage-players act such things as are derogatory to the [[dignity]] and the [[nature]] of the immortals [[immortal]], such as may befall not a [[man]] merely, but the most contemptible [[man]], they not only bear, but willingly listen to. nor is this all, but they even consider that these things please the gods, and that they are propitiated by them.

but some one may say, let us distinguish these two kinds [[kind]] of theology, the mythical and the physical,—that is, the fabulous and the [[natural]],—from this civil [[kind]] about which we are now speaking. anticipating this, he himself has distinguished them. let us see now how he explains the civil theology itself. i see, indeed, why it should be distinguished as fabulous, even because it is false, because it is base, because it is unworthy. but to [[wish]] to distinguish the [[natural]] from the civil, what else is that but to confess that the civil itself is false? for if that be [[natural]], what [[fault]] has it that it should be excluded? and if this which is called civil be not[pg 240] [[natural]], what [[merit]] has it that it should be admitted? this, in [[truth]], is the cause why he wrote first concerning [[human]] things, and afterwards concerning [[divine]] things; since in [[divine]] things he did not [[follow]] [[nature]], but the institution of [[men]]. let us look at this civil theology of his. "the third [[kind]]," says he, "is that which [[citizens]] in cities [[city]], and especially the priests [[priest]], ought to [[know]] and to administer. from it is to be known what [[god]] each one may suitably [[worship]], what [[sacred]] rites and sacrifices [[sacrifice]] each one may suitably perform." let us still attend to what follows. "the first theology," he says, "is especially adapted to the theatre, the second to the [[world]], the third to the [[city]]." who does not see to which he gives the palm? certainly to the second, which he said above is that of the [[philosophers]]. for he testifies that this pertains to the [[world]], than which they [[think]] there is nothing [[better]]. but those two theologies, the first and the third,—to wit, those of the theatre and of the [[city]],—has he distinguished them or [[united]] them? for although we see that the [[city]] is in the [[world]], we do not see that it follows that any things belonging to the [[city]] pertain to the [[world]]. for it is possible that such things may be worshipped and believed in the [[city]], according to false opinions [[opinion]], as have no existence either in the [[world]] or out of it. but where is the theatre but in the [[city]]? who instituted the theatre but the [[state]]? for what [[purpose]] did it constitute it but for scenic plays? and to what class of things do scenic plays belong but to those [[divine]] things concerning which these books [[book]] of varro's are written with so much ability?

6. concerning the mythic, that is, the fabulous, theology, and the civil, against varro.

o marcus varro! thou art [[arts]] the most acute, and without [[doubt]] the most learned, but still a [[man]], not [[god]],—now lifted up by the spirit of [[god]] to see and to announce [[divine]] things, thou seest, indeed, that [[divine]] things are to be separated from [[human]] trifles and lies [[lie]], but thou fearest to offend those most [[corrupt]] opinions [[opinion]] of the populace, and their customs in [[public]] superstitions, which thou thyself, when thou considerest them on all sides, perceivest, and all your literature loudly pronounces to be abhorrent from the [[nature]] of the gods, even[pg 241] of such gods as the frailty of the [[human]] [[mind]] supposes to [[exist]] in the elements of this [[world]]. what can the most excellent [[human]] talent do here? what can [[human]] learning, though manifold, avail thee in this perplexity? thou desirest to [[worship]] the [[natural]] gods; thou art [[arts]] compelled to [[worship]] the civil. thou hast found some of the gods to be fabulous, on whom thou vomitest forth very freely what thou thinkest, and, whether thou willest or not, thou wettest therewith even the civil gods. thou sayest, forsooth, that the fabulous are adapted to the theatre, the [[natural]] to the [[world]], and the civil to the [[city]]; though the [[world]] is a [[divine]] [[work]], but cities [[city]] and theatres are the works [[work]] of [[men]], and though the gods who are laughed at in the theatre are not other than those who are adored in the temples; and ye do not exhibit games in [[honour]] of other gods than those to whom ye immolate victims. how much more freely and more subtly wouldst thou have decided these hadst thou said that some gods are [[natural]], others established by [[men]]; and concerning those who have been so established, the literature of the poets gives one account, and that of the priests [[priest]] another,—both of which are, nevertheless, so friendly the one to the other, through fellowship in falsehood, that they are both pleasing to the demons, to whom the doctrine of the [[truth]] is hostile.

that theology, therefore, which they call [[natural]], being put aside for a moment, as it is afterwards to be discussed, we ask if any one is really content to seek a [[hope]] for eternal [[life]] from poetical, theatrical, scenic gods? perish the thought! the true [[god]] avert so wild and sacrilegious a madness! what, is eternal [[life]] to be [[asked]] from those gods whom these things pleased, and whom these things propitiate, in which their own crimes are represented? no one, as i [[think]], has arrived at such a pitch of headlong and furious impiety. so then, neither by the fabulous nor by the civil theology does any one obtain eternal [[life]]. for the one sows base things concerning the gods by feigning them, the other reaps by cherishing them; the one scatters lies [[lie]], the other gathers them together; the one pursues [[divine]] things with false crimes, the other incorporates among [[divine]] things the plays which are made up of these crimes; the one sounds[pg 242] abroad in [[human]] songs [[song]] impious fictions concerning the gods, the other consecrates these for the festivities of the gods themselves; the one sings the misdeeds and crimes of the gods, the other loves [[love]] them; the one gives forth or feigns, the other either attests the true or delights in the false. both are base; both are damnable. but the one which is theatrical teaches [[teach]] [[public]] abomination, and that one which is of the [[city]] adorns itself with that abomination. shall eternal [[life]] be hoped for from these, by which this short and temporal [[life]] is polluted? does the [[society]] of wicked [[men]] pollute our [[life]] if they insinuate themselves into our affections, and [[win]] our assent? and does not the [[society]] of demons pollute the [[life]], who are worshipped with their own crimes?—if with true crimes, how wicked the demons! if with false, how wicked the worship!

when we say these things, it may perchance seem to some one who is very ignorant of these matters that only those things concerning the gods which are sung in the songs [[song]] of the poets and acted on the stage are unworthy of the [[divine]] majesty, and ridiculous, and too detestable to be celebrated, whilst those [[sacred]] things which not stage-players but priests [[priest]] perform are pure and [[free]] from all unseemliness. had this been so, never would any one have [[thought]] that these theatrical abominations should be celebrated in their [[honour]], never would the gods themselves have ordered them to be performed to them. but [[men]] are in nowise ashamed to perform these things in the theatres, because similar things are carried on in the temples. in short, when the fore-mentioned author attempted to distinguish the civil theology from the fabulous and [[natural]], as a sort of third and distinct [[kind]], he wished it to be understood to be rather tempered by both than separated from either. for he says that those things which the poets write are less than the [[people]] ought to [[follow]], whilst what the [[philosophers]] say is more than it is expedient for the [[people]] to pry into. "which," says he, "differ in such a way, that nevertheless not a few things from both of them have been taken to the account of the civil theology; wherefore we will indicate what the civil theology has in [[common]] with that of the poet, though it ought to be more closely connected with[pg 243] the theology of [[philosophers]]." civil theology is therefore not quite disconnected from that of the poets. nevertheless, in another place, concerning the generations [[generation]] of the gods, he says that the [[people]] are more inclined toward the poets than toward the physical theologists. for in this place he said what ought to be done; in that other place, what was really done. he said that the latter had written for the sake of utility, but the poets for the sake of amusement. and hence the things from the poets' writings, which the [[people]] ought not to [[follow]], are the crimes of the gods; which, nevertheless, amuse both the [[people]] and the gods. for, for amusement's sake, he says, the poets write, and not for that of utility; nevertheless they write such things as the gods will [[desire]], and the [[people]] perform.

7. concerning the likeness and agreement of the fabulous and civil theologies.

that theology, therefore, which is fabulous, theatrical, scenic, and full of all baseness and unseemliness, is taken up into the civil theology; and part of that theology, which in its totality is deservedly judged to be worthy of reprobation and rejection, is pronounced worthy to be cultivated and observed;—not at all an incongruous part, as i have undertaken to show, and one which, being alien to the whole [[body]], was unsuitably attached to and suspended from it, but a part entirely congruous with, and most harmoniously fitted to the rest, as a member of the same [[body]]. for what else do those images, forms, ages [[age]], sexes [[sex]], characteristics of the gods show? if the poets have [[jupiter]] with a beard, and mercury beardless, have not the priests [[priest]] the same? is the priapus of the priests [[priest]] less obscene than the priapus of the players? does he receive the adoration of worshippers in a different form from that in which he moves about the stage for the amusement of spectators? is not saturn old and [[apollo]] [[young]] in the shrines where their images stand, as well as when represented by actor's masks? why are forculus, who presides over doors, and limentinus, who presides over thresholds and lintels, male gods, and cardea between them feminine, who presides over hinges? are not those things found in books [[book]] on [[divine]] things, which grave poets have deemed unworthy of their verses? does the diana of the[pg 244] theatre carry arms, whilst the diana of the [[city]] is simply a virgin? is the stage [[apollo]] a lyrist, but the delphic [[apollo]] ignorant of this art [[arts]]? but these things are decent compared with the more shameful things. what was [[thought]] of [[jupiter]] himself by those who placed his wet nurse in the capitol? did they not bear witness to euhemerus, who, not with the garrulity of a fable-teller, but with the gravity of an historian who had diligently investigated the matter, wrote that all such gods had been [[men]] and mortals? and they who appointed the epulones as parasites at the table of [[jupiter]], what else did they [[wish]] for but mimic [[sacred]] rites? for if any mimic had said that parasites of [[jupiter]] were made use of at his table, he would assuredly have appeared to be seeking to call forth laughter. varro said it,—not when he was mocking, but when he was commending the gods did he say it. his books [[book]] on [[divine]], not on [[human]], things testify that he wrote this,—not where he set forth the scenic games, but where he explained the capitoline laws [[law]]. in a word, he is conquered, and confesses that, as they made the gods with a [[human]] form, so they believed that they are delighted with [[human]] pleasures [[pleasure]].

for also malign spirits were not so wanting to their own [[business]] as not to confirm noxious opinions [[opinion]] in the minds [[mind]] of [[men]] by converting them into [[sport]]. whence also is that story about the sacristan of hercules, which says that, having nothing to do, he took to playing at dice as a pastime, throwing them alternately with the one hand for hercules, with the other for himself, with this understanding, that if he should [[win]], he should from the funds of the temple prepare himself a supper, and hire a mistress; but if hercules should [[win]] the game, he himself should, at his own expense, provide the same for the [[pleasure]] of hercules. then, when he had been beaten by himself, as though by hercules, he gave to the [[god]] hercules the supper he owed him, and also the most [[noble]] harlot larentina. but she, having fallen asleep in the temple, dreamed that hercules had had intercourse with her, and had said to her that she would find her payment with the [[youth]] whom she should first meet on leaving the temple, and that she was to [[believe]] this to be paid to her by hercules. and so the first [[youth]] that met her on going out was the wealthy[pg 245] tarutius, who kept her a long [[time]], and when he died left her his heir. she, having obtained a most ample [[fortune]], that she should not seem ungrateful for the [[divine]] hire, in her turn made the roman [[people]] her heir, which she [[thought]] to be most acceptable to the deities; and, having disappeared, the will was found. by which meritorious conduct they say that she gained [[divine]] honours [[honour]].

now had these things been feigned by the poets and acted by the mimics, they would without any [[doubt]] have been said to pertain to the fabulous theology, and would have been judged worthy to be separated from the [[dignity]] of the civil theology. but when these shameful things,—not of the poets, but of the [[people]]; not of the mimics, but of the [[sacred]] things; not of the theatres, but of the temples, that is, not of the fabulous, but of the civil theology,—are reported by so [[great]] an author, not in [[vain]] do the actors represent with theatrical art [[arts]] the baseness of the gods, which is so [[great]]; but surely in [[vain]] do the priests [[priest]] attempt, by rites called [[sacred]], to represent their nobleness of [[character]], which has no existence. there are [[sacred]] rites of juno; and these are celebrated in her beloved island, samos, where she was given in [[marriage]] to [[jupiter]]. there are [[sacred]] rites of ceres, in which proserpine is sought for, having been carried off by pluto. there are [[sacred]] rites [[venus]], in which, her beloved adonis being slain by a boar's tooth, the lovely [[youth]] is lamented. there are [[sacred]] rites of the [[mother]] of the gods, in which the beautiful [[youth]] atys, loved by her, and castrated by her through a woman's [[jealousy]], is deplored by [[men]] who have [[suffered]] the like calamity, whom they call galli. since, then, these things are more unseemly than all scenic abomination, why is it that they strive to separate, as it were, the fabulous fictions of the poet concerning the gods, as, forsooth, pertaining to the theatre, from the civil theology which they [[wish]] to belong to the [[city]], as though they were separating from [[noble]] and worthy things, things unworthy and base? wherefore there is more [[reason]] to thank the stage-actors, who have spared the [[eyes]] of [[men]], and have not laid bare by theatrical exhibition all the things which are hid by the walls of the temples. what [[good]] is to be [[thought]] of their [[sacred]] rites which are concealed in darkness, when[pg 246] those which are brought forth into the [[light]] are so detestable? and certainly they themselves have seen what they transact in secret through the agency of mutilated and effeminate [[men]]. yet they have not been able to conceal those same [[men]] miserably and vilely enervated and corrupted. let them persuade whom they can that they transact anything holy through such [[men]], who, they cannot deny, are numbered, and [[live]] among their [[sacred]] things. we [[know]] not what they transact, but we [[know]] through whom they transact; for we [[know]] what things are transacted on the stage, where never, even in a chorus of harlots, hath one who is mutilated or an effeminate appeared. and, nevertheless, even these things are acted by vile and infamous characters [[character]]; for, indeed, they ought not to be acted by [[men]] of [[good]] [[character]]. what, then, are those [[sacred]] rites, for the performance of which holiness has chosen such [[men]] as not even the obscenity of the stage has admitted?

8. concerning the interpretations, consisting of [[natural]] explanations, which the pagan teachers attempt to show for their gods.

but all these things, they say, have [[certain]] physical, that is, [[natural]] interpretations, showing their [[natural]] meaning; as though in this disputation we were seeking physics and not theology, which is the account, not of [[nature]], but of [[god]]. for although he who is the true [[god]] is [[god]], not by [[opinion]], but by [[nature]], nevertheless all [[nature]] is not [[god]]; for there is certainly a [[nature]] of [[man]], of a beast, of a tree, of a stone,—none of which is [[god]]. for if, when the [[question]] is concerning the [[mother]] of the gods, that from which the whole [[system]] of interpretation starts certainly is, that the [[mother]] of the gods is the [[earth]], why do we make further inquiry? why do we carry our investigation through all the rest of it? what can more manifestly favour them who say that all those gods were [[men]]? for they are earth-born in the sense that the [[earth]] is their [[mother]]. but in the true theology the [[earth]] is the [[work]], not the [[mother]], of [[god]]. but in whatever way their [[sacred]] rites may be interpreted, and, whatever reference they may have to the [[nature]] of things, it is not according to [[nature]], but contrary to [[nature]], that [[men]] should be effeminates. this disease, this crime, this abomination, has a recognised place among those [[sacred]] things, though even depraved men[pg 247] will scarcely be compelled by torments to confess they are guilty of it. again, if these [[sacred]] rites, which are proved to be fouler than scenic abominations, are excused and justified on the ground that they have their own interpretations, by which they are shown to symbolize the [[nature]] of things, why are not the poetical things in like manner excused and justified? for many have interpreted even these in like [[fashion]], to such a [[degree]] that even that which they say is the most monstrous and most horrible,—namely, that saturn devoured his own [[children]],—has been interpreted by some of them to mean that length of [[time]], which is signified by the name of saturn, consumes whatever it begets; or that, as the same varro thinks [[think]], saturn belongs to seeds which fall back again into the [[earth]] from whence they spring. and so one interprets it in one way, and one in another. and the same is to be said of all the rest of this theology.

and, nevertheless, it is called the fabulous theology, and is censured, cast off, rejected, together with all such interpretations belonging to it. and not only by the [[natural]] theology, which is that of the [[philosophers]], but also by this civil theology, concerning which we are speaking, which is asserted to pertain to cities [[city]] and peoples [[people]], it is judged worthy of repudiation, because it has [[invented]] unworthy things concerning the gods. of which, i wot, this is the secret: that those most acute and learned [[men]], by whom those things were written, understood that both theologies ought to be rejected,—to wit, both that fabulous and this civil one,—but the former they dared to reject, the latter they dared not; the former they set forth to be censured, the latter they showed to be very like it; not that it might be chosen to be held in preference to the other, but that it might be understood to be worthy of being rejected together with it. and thus, without danger to those who feared to censure the civil theology, both of them being brought into contempt, that theology which they call [[natural]] might find a place in [[better]] disposed minds [[mind]]; for the civil and the fabulous are both fabulous and both civil. he who shall wisely inspect the vanities and obscenities of both will find that they are both fabulous; and he who shall direct his attention to the scenic plays pertaining to the fabulous theology[pg 248] in the festivals of the civil gods, and in the [[divine]] rites of the cities [[city]], will find they are both civil. how, then, can the [[power]] of giving eternal [[life]] be attributed to any of those gods whose own images and [[sacred]] rites convict them of being most like to the fabulous gods, which are most openly reprobated, in forms, ages [[age]], [[sex]], characteristics, marriages [[marriage]], generations [[generation]], rites; in all which things they are understood either to have been [[men]], and to have had their [[sacred]] rites and solemnities instituted in their [[honour]] according to the [[life]] or [[death]] of each of them, the demons suggesting and confirming this error, or certainly most foul spirits, who, taking advantage of some [[occasion]] or other, have stolen into the minds [[mind]] of [[men]] to [[deceive]] them?

9. concerning the special offices of the gods.

and as to those very offices of the gods, so meanly and so minutely portioned out, so that they say that they ought to be supplicated, each one according to his special function,—about which we have spoken much already, though not all that is to be said concerning it,—are they not more consistent with mimic buffoonery than [[divine]] majesty? if any one should use two nurses for his infant, one of whom should give nothing but food, the other nothing but drink, as these make use of two goddesses [[goddess]] for this [[purpose]], educa and potina, he should certainly seem to be foolish, and to do in his house a thing worthy of a mimic. they would have liber to have been named from "liberation," because through him males at the [[time]] of copulation are liberated by the emission of the seed. they also say that libera (the same in their [[opinion]] as venus) exercises the same function in the case of [[women]], because they say that they also emit seed; and they also say that on this account the same part of the male and of the female is placed in the temple, that of the male to liber, and that of the female to libera. to these things they add the [[women]] assigned to liber, and the wine for exciting [[lust]]. thus the bacchanalia are celebrated with the utmost insanity, with [[respect]] to which varro himself confesses that such things would not be done by the bacchanals except their minds [[mind]] were highly excited. these things, however, afterwards displeased a saner senate, and it ordered them to be discontinued. here, at length, they[pg 249] perhaps perceived how much [[power]] unclean spirits, when held to be gods, exercise over the minds [[mind]] of [[men]]. these things, certainly, were not to be done in the theatres; for there they play, not rave, although to have gods who are delighted with such plays is very like raving.

but what [[kind]] of distinction is this which he makes between the [[religious]] and the [[superstitious]] [[man]], saying that the gods are feared[238] by the [[superstitious]] [[man]], but are reverenced[239] as parents by the [[religious]] [[man]], not feared as enemies [[enemy]]; and that they are all so [[good]] that they will more readily spare those who are impious than hurt one who is [[innocent]]? and yet he tells us that three gods are assigned as guardians to a woman after she has been delivered, lest the [[god]] silvanus come in and molest her; and that in order to signify the presence of these protectors, three [[men]] go round the house during the night, and first strike the threshold with a hatchet, next with a pestle, and the third [[time]] sweep it with a brush, in order that these symbols of agriculture having been exhibited, the [[god]] silvanus might be hindered from entering, because neither are trees cut down or pruned without a hatchet, neither is grain ground without a pestle, nor corn heaped up without a besom. now from these three things three gods have been named: intercidona, from the cut[240] made by the hatchet; pilumnus, from the pestle; diverra, from the besom;—by which guardian gods the woman who has been delivered is preserved against the [[power]] of the [[god]] silvanus. thus the guardianship of kindly-disposed gods would not avail against the malice of a mischievous [[god]], unless they were three to one, and fought against him, as it were, with the opposing emblems of cultivation, who, being an inhabitant of the woods, is rough, horrible, and uncultivated. is this the innocence of the gods? is this their concord? are these the health-giving deities of the cities [[city]], more ridiculous than the things which are laughed at in the theatres?

when a male and a female are [[united]], the [[god]] jugatinus presides. well, let this be borne with. but the [[married]] woman must be brought [[home]]: the [[god]] domiducus also is invoked. that she may be in the house, the [[god]] domitius is introduced. that she may remain with her husband, the [[goddess]] manturnæ[pg 250] is used. what more is required? let [[human]] modesty be spared. let the [[lust]] of flesh and [[blood]] go on with the rest, the secret of shame being respected. why is the bedchamber filled with a crowd of deities, when even the groomsmen[241] have departed? and, moreover, it is so filled, not that in consideration of their presence more regard may be paid to chastity, but that by their [[help]] the woman, naturally of the weaker [[sex]], and trembling with the novelty of her situation, may the more readily yield her virginity. for there are the [[goddess]] virginiensis, and the god-father subigus, and the goddess-mother prema, and the [[goddess]] pertunda, and [[venus]], and priapus.[242] what is this? if it was absolutely necessary that a [[man]], labouring at this [[work]], should be helped by the gods, might not some one [[god]] or [[goddess]] have been sufficient? was [[venus]] not sufficient alone, who is even said to be named from this, that without her [[power]] a woman does not cease to be a virgin? if there is any shame in [[men]], which is not in the deities, is it not the case that, when the [[married]] couple [[believe]] that so many gods of either [[sex]] are [[present]], and busy at this [[work]], they are so much affected with shame, that the [[man]] is less moved, and the woman more reluctant? and certainly, if the [[goddess]] virginiensis is [[present]] to loose the virgin's zone, if the [[god]] subigus is [[present]] that the virgin may be got under the [[man]], if the [[goddess]] prema is [[present]] that, having been got under him, she may be kept down, and may not move herself, what has the [[goddess]] pertunda to do there? let her blush; let her go forth. let the husband himself do something. it is disgraceful that any one but himself should do that from which she gets her name. but perhaps she is tolerated because she is said to be a [[goddess]], and not a [[god]]. for if she were believed to be a male, and were called pertundus, the husband would demand more [[help]] against him for the chastity of his [[wife]] than the newly-delivered woman against silvanus. but why am i saying this, when priapus, too, is there, a male to excess, upon whose immense and most unsightly member the newly-married bride is commanded[pg 251] to sit, according to the most honourable and most [[religious]] custom of matrons?

let them go on, and let them attempt with all the subtlety they can to distinguish the civil theology from the fabulous, the cities [[city]] from the theatres, the temples from the stages, the [[sacred]] things of the priests [[priest]] from the songs [[song]] of the poets, as honourable things from base things, truthful things from fallacious, grave from [[light]], serious from ludicrous, desirable things from things to be rejected, we [[understand]] what they do. they are aware that that theatrical and fabulous theology hangs by the civil, and is reflected back upon it from the songs [[song]] of the poets as from a mirror; and thus, that theology having been exposed to view which they do not dare to condemn, they more freely assail and censure that picture of it, in order that those who perceive what they mean may detest this very face itself of which that is the picture,—which, however, the gods themselves, as though seeing themselves in the same mirror, [[love]] so much, that it is [[better]] seen in both of them who and what they are. whence, also, they have compelled their worshippers, with terrible commands, to dedicate to them the uncleanness of the fabulous theology, to put them among their solemnities, and reckon them among [[divine]] things; and thus they have both shown themselves more manifestly to be most impure spirits, and have made that rejected and reprobated theatrical theology a member and a part of this, as it were, chosen and approved theology of the [[city]], so that, though the whole is disgraceful and false, and contains in it fictitious gods, one part of it is in the literature of the priests [[priest]], the other in the songs [[song]] of the poets. whether it may have other parts is another [[question]]. at [[present]], i [[think]], i have sufficiently shown, on account of the division of varro, that the theology of the [[city]] and that of the theatre belong to one civil theology. wherefore, because they are both equally disgraceful, absurd, shameful, false, far be it from [[religious]] [[men]] to [[hope]] for eternal [[life]] from either the one or the other.

in fine, even varro himself, in his account and enumeration of the gods, starts from the moment of a man's [[man]] conception. he commences the series of those gods who take charge of [[man]] with janus, carries it on to the [[death]] of the [[man]] decrepit[pg 252] with [[age]], and terminates it with the [[goddess]] nænia, who is sung at the funerals of the aged. after that, he begins to give an account of the other gods, whose province is not [[man]] himself, but man's [[man]] belongings, as food, clothing, and all that is necessary for this [[life]]; and, in the case of all these, he explains what is the special office of each, and for what each ought to be supplicated. but with all this scrupulous and comprehensive diligence, he has neither proved the existence, nor so much as mentioned the name, of any [[god]] from whom eternal [[life]] is to be sought,—the one object for which we are christians [[christian]]. who, then, is so stupid as not to perceive that this [[man]], by setting forth and opening up so diligently the civil theology, and by exhibiting its likeness to that fabulous, shameful, and disgraceful theology, and also by teaching that that fabulous sort is also a part of this other, was labouring to obtain a place in the minds [[mind]] of [[men]] for none but that [[natural]] theology which he says pertains to [[philosophers]], with such subtlety that he censures the fabulous, and, not daring openly to censure the civil, shows its censurable [[character]] by simply exhibiting it; and thus, both being reprobated by the [[judgment]] of [[men]] of [[right]] understanding, the [[natural]] alone remains to be chosen? but concerning this in its own place, by the [[help]] of the true [[god]], we have to discuss more diligently.

10. concerning the [[liberty]] of seneca, who more vehemently censured the civil theology than varro did the fabulous.

that [[liberty]], in [[truth]], which this [[man]] wanted, so that he did not dare to censure that theology of the [[city]], which is very similar to the theatrical, so openly as he did the theatrical itself, was, though not fully, yet in part possessed by annæus seneca, whom we have some evidence to show to have flourished in the times [[time]] of our [[apostles]]. it was in part possessed by him, i say, for he possessed it in writing, but not in living. for in that [[book]] which he wrote against superstition,[243] he more copiously and vehemently censured that civil and urban theology than varro the theatrical and fabulous. for, when speaking concerning images, he says, "they dedicate images of the [[sacred]] and inviolable immortals [[immortal]] in most worthless and motionless matter. they give them[pg 253] the appearance of [[man]], beasts, and fishes, and some make them of mixed [[sex]], and heterogeneous bodies [[body]]. they call them deities, when they are such that if they should get breath and should suddenly meet them, they would be held to be monsters." then, a while afterwards, when extolling the [[natural]] theology, he had expounded the sentiments of [[certain]] [[philosophers]], he opposes to himself a [[question]], and says, "here some one says, shall i [[believe]] that the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]] are gods, and that some are above the moon and some below it? shall i bring forward either [[plato]] or the peripatetic strato, one of whom made [[god]] to be without a [[body]], the other without a [[mind]]?" in [[answer]] to which he says, "and, really, what truer do the dreams [[dream]] of titus tatius, or romulus, or tullus hostilius appear to thee? tatius declared the divinity of the [[goddess]] cloacina; romulus that of picus and tiberinus; tullus hostilius that of pavor and pallor, the most disagreeable affections of [[men]], the one of which is the agitation of the [[mind]] under fright, the other that of the [[body]], not a disease, indeed, but a [[change]] of colour." wilt thou rather [[believe]] that these are deities, and receive them into [[heaven]]? but with what [[freedom]] he has written concerning the rites themselves, cruel and shameful! "one," he says, "castrates himself, another cuts his arms. where will they find room for the [[fear]] of these gods when angry, who use such means of gaining their favour when propitious? but gods who [[wish]] to be worshipped in this [[fashion]] should be worshipped in none. so [[great]] is the frenzy of the [[mind]] when perturbed and driven from its seat, that the gods are propitiated by [[men]] in a manner in which not even [[men]] of the [[greatest]] ferocity and fable-renowned [[cruelty]] vent their rage. tyrants [[tyrant]] have lacerated the limbs of some; they never ordered any one to lacerate his own. for the gratification of [[royal]] [[lust]], some have been castrated; but no one ever, by the command of his [[lord]], laid [[violent]] hands on himself to emasculate himself. they kill themselves in the temples. they supplicate with their wounds and with their [[blood]]. if any one has [[time]] to see the things they do and the things they suffer, he will find so many things unseemly for [[men]] of respectability, so unworthy of freemen, so unlike the doings[pg 254] of sane [[men]], that no one would [[doubt]] that they are mad, had they been mad with the minority; but now the multitude of the insane is the defence of their sanity."

he next relates those things which are wont to be done in the capitol, and with the utmost intrepidity insists that they are such things as one could only [[believe]] to be done by [[men]] making [[sport]], or by madmen. for, having spoken with derision of this, that in the egyptian [[sacred]] rites osiris, being lost, is lamented for, but straightway, when found, is the [[occasion]] of [[great]] joy by his reappearance, because both the losing and the finding of him are feigned; and yet that [[grief]] and that joy which are elicited thereby from those who have lost nothing and found nothing are real;—having, i say, so spoken of this, he says, "still there is a fixed [[time]] for this frenzy. it is tolerable to go mad once in the year. go into the capitol. one is suggesting [[divine]] commands[244] to a [[god]]; another is telling the hours to [[jupiter]]; one is a lictor; another is an anointer, who with the mere movement of his arms imitates one anointing. there are [[women]] who arrange the hair of juno and minerva, standing far away not only from her image, but even from her temple. these move their fingers in the manner of hair-dressers. there are some [[women]] who hold a mirror. there are some who are calling the gods to assist them in court. there are some who are holding up documents to them, and are explaining to them their cases. a learned and distinguished comedian, now old and decrepit, was daily playing the mimic in the capitol, as though the gods would gladly be spectators of that which [[men]] had ceased to [[care]] about. every [[kind]] of artificers working for the [[immortal]] gods is dwelling there in idleness." and a little after he says, "nevertheless these, though they give themselves up to the gods for purposes [[purpose]] superfluous enough, do not do so for any abominable or infamous [[purpose]]. there sit [[certain]] [[women]] in the capitol who [[think]] they are beloved by [[jupiter]]; nor are they frightened even by the look of the, if you will [[believe]] the poets, most wrathful juno."

[pg 255]

this [[liberty]] varro did not enjoy. it was only the poetical theology he seemed to censure. the civil, which this [[man]] cuts to pieces, he was not bold enough to impugn. but if we attend to the [[truth]], the temples where these things are performed are far worse than the theatres where they are represented. whence, with [[respect]] to these [[sacred]] rites of the civil theology, seneca preferred, as the [[best]] course to be followed by a [[wise]] [[man]], to feign [[respect]] for them in act, but to have no real regard for them at [[heart]]. "all which things," he says, "a [[wise]] [[man]] will observe as being commanded by the laws [[law]], but not as being pleasing to the gods." and a little after he says, "and what of this, that we unite the gods in [[marriage]], and that not even naturally, for we join brothers [[brother]] and sisters? we [[marry]] bellona to [[mars]], [[venus]] to vulcan, salacia to [[neptune]]. some of them we leave unmarried, as though there were no match for them, which is surely needless, especially when there are [[certain]] unmarried goddesses [[goddess]], as populonia, or fulgora, or the [[goddess]] rumina, for whom i am not astonished that suitors have been awanting. all this ignoble crowd of gods, which the superstition of ages [[age]] has amassed, we ought," he says, "to adore in such a way as to [[remember]] all the while that its [[worship]] belongs rather to custom than to reality." wherefore, neither those laws [[law]] nor customs instituted in the civil theology that which was pleasing to the gods, or which pertained to reality. but this [[man]], whom [[philosophy]] had made, as it were, [[free]], nevertheless, because he was an illustrious senator of the roman [[people]], worshipped what he censured, did what he condemned, adored what he reproached, because, forsooth, [[philosophy]] had taught him something [[great]],—namely, not to be [[superstitious]] in the [[world]], but, on account of the laws [[law]] of cities [[city]] and the customs of [[men]], to be an actor, not on the stage, but in the temples,—conduct the more to be condemned, that those things which he was deceitfully acting he so acted that the [[people]] [[thought]] he was acting sincerely. but a stage-actor would rather delight [[people]] by acting plays than take them in by false pretences.

11. what seneca [[thought]] concerning the [[jews]].

seneca, among the other superstitions of civil theology,[pg 256] also found [[fault]] with the [[sacred]] things of the [[jews]], and especially the sabbaths, affirming that they act uselessly in keeping those seventh days, whereby they lose through idleness about the seventh part of their [[life]], and also many things which demand immediate attention are damaged. the christians [[christian]], however, who were already most hostile to the [[jews]], he did not dare to mention, either for [[praise]] or blame, lest, if he praised them, he should do so against the ancient custom of his [[country]], or, perhaps, if he should blame them, he should do so against his own will.

when he was speaking concerning those [[jews]], he said, "when, meanwhile, the customs of that most accursed nation have gained such [[strength]] that they have been now received in all lands [[land]], the conquered have given laws [[law]] to the conquerors." by these words he expresses his astonishment; and, not knowing what the providence of [[god]] was leading him to say, subjoins in plain words an [[opinion]] by which he showed what he [[thought]] about the meaning of those [[sacred]] [[institutions]]: "for," he says, "those, however, [[know]] the cause of their rites, whilst the greater part of the [[people]] [[know]] not why they perform theirs." but concerning the solemnities of the [[jews]], either why or how far they were instituted by [[divine]] [[authority]], and afterwards, in due [[time]], by the same [[authority]] taken away from the [[people]] of [[god]], to whom the mystery of eternal [[life]] was revealed, we have both spoken elsewhere, especially when we were treating against the manichæans, and also intend to speak in this [[work]] in a more suitable place.

12. that when once the vanity of the gods of the nations has been exposed, it cannot be doubted that they are unable to bestow eternal [[life]] on any one, when they cannot afford [[help]] even with [[respect]] to the things of this temporal [[life]].

now, since there are three theologies, which the greeks [[greek]] call respectively mythical, physical, and [[political]], and which may be called in latin fabulous, [[natural]], and civil; and since neither from the fabulous, which even the worshippers of many and false gods have themselves most freely censured, nor from the civil, of which that is convicted of being a part, or even worse than it, can eternal [[life]] be hoped for from any of these theologies,—if any one thinks [[think]] that what has been[pg 257] said in this [[book]] is not enough for him, let him also add to it the many and various dissertations concerning [[god]] as the giver of felicity, contained in the former books [[book]], especially the fourth one.

for to what but to felicity should [[men]] consecrate themselves, were felicity a [[goddess]]? however, as it is not a [[goddess]], but a gift of [[god]], to what [[god]] but the giver of [[happiness]] ought we to consecrate ourselves, who piously [[love]] eternal [[life]], in which there is true and full felicity? but i [[think]], from what has been said, no one ought to [[doubt]] that none of those gods is the giver of [[happiness]], who are worshipped with such shame, and who, if they are not so worshipped, are more shamefully enraged, and thus confess that they are most foul spirits. moreover, how can he give eternal [[life]] who cannot give [[happiness]]? for we mean by eternal [[life]] that [[life]] where there is endless [[happiness]]. for if the [[soul]] [[live]] in eternal punishments [[punishment]], by which also those unclean spirits shall be tormented, that is rather eternal [[death]] than eternal [[life]]. for there is no greater or worse [[death]] than when [[death]] never dies. but because the [[soul]] from its very [[nature]], being created [[immortal]], cannot be without some [[kind]] of [[life]], its utmost [[death]] is alienation from the [[life]] of [[god]] in an eternity of [[punishment]]. so, then, he only who gives true [[happiness]] gives eternal [[life]], that is, an endlessly [[happy]] [[life]]. and since those gods whom this civil theology worships have been proved to be unable to give this [[happiness]], they ought not to be worshipped on account of those temporal and terrestrial things, as we showed in the five former books [[book]], much less on account of eternal [[life]], which is to be after [[death]], as we have sought to show in this one [[book]] especially, whilst the other books [[book]] also lend it their co-operation. but since the [[strength]] of inveterate habit has its roots very deep, if any one thinks [[think]] that i have not disputed sufficiently to show that this civil theology ought to be rejected and shunned, let him attend to another [[book]] which, with god's [[help]], is to be joined to this one.

book seventh.

argument.

in this [[book]] it is shown that eternal [[life]] is not obtained by the [[worship]] of janus, [[jupiter]], saturn, and the other "select gods" of the civil theology.

preface.

it will be the [[duty]] of those who are endowed with quicker and [[better]] understandings, in whose case the former books [[book]] are sufficient, and more than sufficient, to effect their intended object, to bear with me with patience and equanimity whilst i attempt with more than ordinary diligence to tear up and eradicate depraved and ancient opinions [[opinion]] hostile to the [[truth]] of piety, which the long-continued error of the [[human]] [[race]] has fixed very deeply in unenlightened minds [[mind]]; co-operating also in this, according to my little measure, with the grace of him who, being the true [[god]], is able to accomplish it, and on whose [[help]] i depend in my [[work]]; and, for the sake of others, such should not deem superfluous what they [[feel]] to be no longer necessary for themselves. a very [[great]] matter is at stake when the true and truly holy divinity is commended to [[men]] as that which they ought to seek after and to [[worship]]; not, however, on account of the transitory vapour of mortal [[life]], but on account of [[life]] eternal, which alone is blessed, although the [[help]] necessary for this frail [[life]] we are now living is also afforded us by it.

1. whether, since it is evident that deity is not to be found in the civil theology, we are to [[believe]] that it is to be found in the select gods.

if there is any one whom the sixth [[book]], which i have [[last]] finished, has not persuaded that this divinity, or, so to speak, deity—for this word also our authors do not hesitate to use, in order to translate more accurately that which the greeks [[greek]] call θεότης;—if there is any one, i say, whom the sixth [[book]] has not persuaded that this divinity or deity is not to be[pg 259] found in that theology which they call civil, and which marcus varro has explained in sixteen books [[book]],—that is, that the [[happiness]] of eternal [[life]] is not attainable through the [[worship]] of gods such as states have established to be worshipped, and that in such a form,—perhaps, when he has [[read]] this [[book]], he will not have anything further to [[desire]] in order to the clearing up of this [[question]]. for it is possible that some one may [[think]] that at least the select and [[chief]] gods, whom varro comprised in his [[last]] [[book]], and of whom we have not spoken sufficiently, are to be worshipped on account of the blessed [[life]], which is none other than eternal. in [[respect]] to which matter i do not say what tertullian said, perhaps more wittily than truly, "if gods are selected like onions, certainly the rest are rejected as [[bad]]."[245] i do not say this, for i see that even from among the select, some are selected for some greater and more excellent office: as in warfare, when recruits have been elected, there are some again elected from among those for the performance of some greater [[military]] service; and in the [[church]], when persons [[person]] are elected to be overseers, certainly the rest are not rejected, since all [[good]] christians [[christian]] are deservedly called elect; in the erection of a building corner stones are elected, though the other stones, which are destined for other parts of the structure, are not rejected; grapes are elected for eating, whilst the others, which we leave for drinking, are not rejected. there is no need of adducing many illustrations, since the thing is evident. wherefore the selection of [[certain]] gods from among many affords no proper [[reason]] why either he who wrote on this [[subject]], or the worshippers of the gods, or the gods themselves, should be spurned. we ought rather to seek to [[know]] what gods these are, and for what [[purpose]] they may appear to have been selected.

2. who are the select gods, and whether they are held to be exempt from the offices of the commoner gods.

the following gods, certainly, varro signalizes as select, devoting one [[book]] to this [[subject]]: janus, [[jupiter]], saturn, genius, mercury, [[apollo]], [[mars]], vulcan, [[neptune]], sol, orcus, [[father]] liber, tellus, ceres, juno, luna, diana, minerva, [[venus]],[pg 260] vesta; of which twenty gods, twelve are males, and eight females. whether are these deities called select, because of their higher spheres of administration in the [[world]], or because they have become [[better]] known to the [[people]], and more [[worship]] has been expended on them? if it be on account of the greater works [[work]] which are performed by them in the [[world]], we ought not to have found them among that, as it were, plebeian crowd of deities, which has assigned to it the charge of minute and trifling things. for, first of all, at the conception of a fœtus, from which point all the works [[work]] commence which have been distributed in minute detail to many deities, janus himself opens the way for the reception of the seed; there also is saturn, on account of the seed itself; there is liber,[246] who liberates the male by the effusion of the seed; there is libera, whom they also would have to be [[venus]], who confers this same benefit on the woman, namely, that she also be liberated by the emission of the seed;—all these are of the number of those who are called select. but there is also the [[goddess]] mena, who presides over the menses; though the [[daughter]] of [[jupiter]], ignoble nevertheless. and this province of the menses the same author, in his [[book]] on the select gods, assigns to juno herself, who is even queen among the select gods; and here, as juno lucina, along with the same mena, her stepdaughter, she presides over the same [[blood]]. there also are two gods, exceedingly obscure, vitumnus and sentinus—the one of whom imparts [[life]] to the fœtus, and the other sensation; and, of a [[truth]], they bestow, most ignoble though they be, far more than all those [[noble]] and select gods bestow. for, surely, without [[life]] and sensation, what is the whole fœtus which a woman carries in her womb, but a most vile and worthless thing, no [[better]] than slime and dust?

3. how there is no [[reason]] which can be shown for the selection of [[certain]] gods, when the administration of more exalted offices is assigned to many inferior gods.

what is the cause, therefore, which has driven so many select gods to these very small works [[work]], in which they are excelled by vitumnus and sentinus, though little known and[pg 261] sunk in obscurity, inasmuch as they confer the munificent gifts of [[life]] and sensation? for the select janus bestows an entrance, and, as it were, a door[247] for the seed; the select saturn bestows the seed itself; the select liber bestows on [[men]] the emission of the same seed; libera, who is ceres or [[venus]], confers the same on [[women]]; the select juno confers (not alone, but together with mena, the [[daughter]] of jupiter) the menses, for the [[growth]] of that which has been conceived; and the obscure and ignoble vitumnus confers [[life]], whilst the obscure and ignoble sentinus confers sensation;—which two [[last]] things are as much more excellent than the others, as they themselves are excelled by [[reason]] and [[intellect]]. for as those things which [[reason]] and [[understand]] are preferable to those which, without [[intellect]] and [[reason]], as in the case of cattle, [[live]] and [[feel]]; so also those things which have been endowed with [[life]] and sensation are deservedly preferred to those things which neither [[live]] nor [[feel]]. therefore vitumnus the life-giver,[248] and sentinus the sense-giver,[249] ought to have been reckoned among the select gods, rather than janus the admitter of seed, and saturn the giver or sower of seed, and liber and libera the movers and liberators of seed; which seed is not worth a [[thought]], unless it attain to [[life]] and sensation. yet these select gifts are not given by select gods, but by [[certain]] unknown, and, considering their [[dignity]], neglected gods. but if it be replied that janus has dominion over all beginnings, and therefore the opening of the way for conception is not without [[reason]] assigned to him; and that saturn has dominion over all seeds, and therefore the sowing of the seed whereby a [[human]] being is generated cannot be excluded from his operation; that liber and libera have [[power]] over the emission of all seeds, and therefore preside over those seeds which pertain to the procreation of [[men]]; that juno presides over all purgations and births, and therefore she has also charge of the purgations of [[women]] and the births of [[human]] beings;—if they give this reply, let them find an [[answer]] to the [[question]] concerning vitumnus and sentinus, whether they are willing that these likewise should have dominion over all things which [[live]] and [[feel]]. if they grant this, let them[pg 262] observe in how sublime a position they are about to place them. for to spring from seeds is in the [[earth]] and of the [[earth]], but to [[live]] and [[feel]] are supposed to be properties [[property]] even of the sidereal gods. but if they say that only such things as come to [[life]] in flesh, and are supported by senses, are assigned to sentinus, why does not that [[god]] who made all things [[live]] and [[feel]], bestow on flesh also [[life]] and sensation, in the universality of his operation conferring also on fœtuses this gift? and what, then, is the use of vitumnus and sentinus? but if these, as it were, extreme and lowest things have been committed by him who presides universally over [[life]] and sense to these gods as to servants, are these select gods then so destitute of servants, that they could not find any to whom even they might commit those things, but with all their [[dignity]], for which they are, it seems, deemed worthy to be selected, were compelled to perform their [[work]] along with ignoble ones? juno is select queen of the gods, and the sister and [[wife]] of [[jupiter]]; nevertheless she is iterduca, the conductor, to boys, and performs this [[work]] along with a most ignoble pair—the goddesses [[goddess]] abeona and adeona. there they have also placed the [[goddess]] mena, who gives to boys a [[good]] [[mind]], and she is not placed among the select gods; as if anything greater could be bestowed on a [[man]] than a [[good]] [[mind]]. but juno is placed among the select because she is iterduca and domiduca (she who conducts one on a [[journey]], and who conducts him [[home]] again); as if it is of any advantage for one to make a [[journey]], and to be conducted [[home]] again, if his [[mind]] is not [[good]]. and yet the [[goddess]] who bestows that gift has not been placed by the selectors among the select gods, though she ought indeed to have been preferred even to minerva, to whom, in this minute distribution of [[work]], they have allotted the memory of boys. for who will [[doubt]] that it is a far [[better]] thing to have a [[good]] [[mind]], than ever so [[great]] a memory? for no one is [[bad]] who has a [[good]] [[mind]];[250] but some who are very [[bad]] are possessed of an admirable memory, and are so much the worse, the less they are able to forget the [[bad]] things which they [[think]]. and yet minerva is among the select gods, whilst the [[goddess]] mena is hidden by a worthless[pg 263] crowd. what shall i say concerning virtus? what concerning felicitas?—concerning whom i have already spoken much in the fourth [[book]],[251] to whom, though they held them to be goddesses [[goddess]], they have not [[thought]] fit to assign a place among the select gods, among whom they have given a place to [[mars]] and orcus, the one the causer of [[death]], the other the receiver of the [[dead]].

since, therefore, we see that even the select gods themselves [[work]] together with the others, like a senate with the [[people]], in all those minute works [[work]] which have been minutely portioned out among many gods; and since we find that far greater and [[better]] things are administered by [[certain]] gods who have not been reckoned worthy to be selected than by those who are called select, it remains that we suppose that they were called select and [[chief]], not on account of their holding more exalted offices in the [[world]], but because it happened to them to become [[better]] known to the [[people]]. and even varro himself says, that in that way obscurity had fallen to the lot of some [[father]] gods and [[mother]] goddesses [[goddess]],[252] as it falls to the lot of [[men]]. if, therefore, felicity ought not perhaps to have been put among the select gods, because they did not attain to that [[noble]] position by [[merit]], but by [[chance]], [[fortune]] at least should have been placed among them, or rather before them; for they say that that [[goddess]] distributes to every one the gifts she receives, not according to any [[rational]] arrangement, but according as [[chance]] may determine. she ought to have held the uppermost place among the select gods, for among them chiefly it is that she shows what [[power]] she has. for we see that they have been selected not on account of some eminent [[virtue]] or [[rational]] [[happiness]], but by that random [[power]] of [[fortune]] which the worshippers of these gods [[think]] that she exerts. for that most eloquent [[man]] sallust also may perhaps have the gods themselves in view when he says: "but, in [[truth]], [[fortune]] rules [[rule]] in everything; it renders all things famous or obscure, according to caprice rather than according to [[truth]]."[253] for they cannot[pg 264] discover a [[reason]] why [[venus]] should have been made famous, whilst virtus has been made obscure, when the divinity of both of them has been solemnly recognised by them, and their merits [[merit]] are not to be compared. again, if she has deserved a [[noble]] position on account of the [[fact]] that she is much sought after—for there are more who seek after [[venus]] than after virtus—why has minerva been celebrated whilst pecunia has been left in obscurity, although throughout the whole [[human]] [[race]] avarice allures a far greater number than [[skill]]? and even among those who are skilled in the [[arts]], you will rarely find a [[man]] who does not practise his own art [[arts]] for the [[purpose]] of pecuniary gain; and that for the sake of which anything is made, is always valued more than that which is made for the sake of something else. if, then, this selection of gods has been made by the [[judgment]] of the foolish multitude, why has not the [[goddess]] pecunia been preferred to minerva, since there are many artificers for the sake of [[money]]? but if this distinction has been made by the few [[wise]], why has virtus been preferred to [[venus]], when [[reason]] by far prefers the former? at all events, as i have already said, [[fortune]] herself—who, according to those who attribute most influence to her, renders all things famous or obscure according to caprice rather than according to the truth—since she has been able to exercise so much [[power]] even over the gods, as, according to her capricious [[judgment]], to render those of them famous whom she would, and those obscure whom she would; [[fortune]] herself ought to occupy the place of pre-eminence among the select gods, since over them also she has such pre-eminent [[power]]. or must we suppose that the [[reason]] why she is not among the select is simply this, that even [[fortune]] herself has had an adverse [[fortune]]? she was adverse, then, to herself, since, whilst ennobling others, she herself has remained obscure.

4. the inferior gods, whose names are not associated with infamy, have been [[better]] dealt with than the select gods, whose infamies are celebrated.

however, any one who eagerly seeks for celebrity and renown, might congratulate those select gods, and call them fortunate, were it not that he saw that they have been selected more to their injury than to their [[honour]]. for that low crowd of gods have been protected by their very meanness[pg 265] and obscurity from being overwhelmed with infamy. we laugh, indeed, when we see them distributed by the mere fiction of [[human]] opinions [[opinion]], according to the special works [[work]] assigned to them, like those who farm small portions of the [[public]] [[revenue]], or like workmen in the street of the silversmiths,[254] where one vessel, in order that it may go out [[perfect]], passes through the hands of many, when it might have been finished by one [[perfect]] workman. but the only [[reason]] why the combined [[skill]] of many workmen was [[thought]] necessary, was, that it is [[better]] that each part of an art [[arts]] should be learned by a special workman, which can be done speedily and easily, than that they should all be compelled to be [[perfect]] in one art [[arts]] throughout all its parts, which they could only attain slowly and with difficulty. nevertheless there is scarcely to be found one of the non-select gods who has brought infamy on himself by any crime, whilst there is scarce any one of the select gods who has not received upon himself the brand of notable infamy. these latter have descended to the humble works [[work]] of the others, whilst the others have not come up to their sublime crimes. concerning janus, there does not readily occur to my recollection anything infamous; and perhaps he was such an one as lived more innocently than the rest, and further removed from misdeeds and crimes. he kindly received and entertained saturn when he was fleeing; he divided his [[kingdom]] with his guest, so that each of them had a [[city]] for himself,[255]—the one janiculum, and the other saturnia. but those seekers after every [[kind]] of unseemliness in the [[worship]] of the gods have disgraced him, whose [[life]] they found to be less disgraceful than that of the other gods, with an image of monstrous deformity, making it sometimes with two faces, and sometimes, as it were, double, with four faces.[256] did they [[wish]] that, as the most of the select gods had lost shame[257] through the perpetration of shameful crimes, his greater innocence should be marked by a greater number of faces?[258]

[pg 266]

5. concerning the more secret doctrine of the pagans, and concerning the physical interpretations.

but let us hear their own physical interpretations by which they attempt to colour, as with the appearance of profounder doctrine, the baseness of most miserable error. varro, in the first place, commends these interpretations so strongly as to say, that the ancients [[invented]] the images, badges, and adornments of the gods, in order that when those who went to the mysteries should see them with their bodily [[eyes]], they might with the [[eyes]] of their [[mind]] see the [[soul]] of the [[world]], and its parts, that is, the true gods; and also that the meaning which was intended by those who made their images with the [[human]] form, seemed to be this,—namely, that the [[mind]] of mortals, which is in a [[human]] [[body]], is very like to the [[immortal]] [[mind]],[259] just as vessels might be placed to represent the gods, as, for instance, a wine-vessel might be placed in the temple of liber, to signify wine, that which is contained being signified by that which contains. thus by an image which had the [[human]] form the [[rational]] [[soul]] was signified, because the [[human]] form is the vessel, as it were, in which that [[nature]] is wont to be contained which they attribute to [[god]], or to the gods. these are the mysteries of doctrine to which that most learned [[man]] penetrated in order that he might bring them forth to the [[light]]. but, o thou most acute [[man]], hast thou lost among those mysteries that prudence which [[led]] thee to form the sober [[opinion]], that those who first established those images for the [[people]] took away [[fear]] from the [[citizens]] and added error, and that the ancient romans honoured the gods more chastely without images? for it was through consideration of them that thou wast emboldened to speak these things against the later romans. for if those most ancient romans also had worshipped images, perhaps thou wouldst have suppressed by the [[silence]] of [[fear]] all those sentiments (true sentiments, nevertheless) concerning the folly of setting up images, and wouldst have extolled more loftily, and more loquaciously, those mysterious doctrines consisting of these [[vain]] and pernicious fictions. thy [[soul]], so learned and so clever (and for this i grieve much for thee), could never through these mysteries have reached its [[god]]; that[pg 267] is, the [[god]] by whom, not with whom, it was made, of whom it is not a part, but a [[work]],—that [[god]] who is not the [[soul]] of all things, but who made every [[soul]], and in whose [[light]] alone every [[soul]] is blessed, if it be not ungrateful for his grace.

but the things which [[follow]] in this [[book]] will show what is the [[nature]] of these mysteries, and what value is to be set upon them. meanwhile, this most learned [[man]] confesses as his [[opinion]] that the [[soul]] of the [[world]] and its parts are the true gods, from which we perceive that his theology (to wit, that same [[natural]] theology to which he pays [[pay]] [[great]] regard) has been able, in its completeness, to extend itself even to the [[nature]] of the [[rational]] [[soul]]. for in this [[book]] (concerning the select gods) he says a very few things by anticipation concerning the [[natural]] theology; and we shall see whether he has been able in that [[book]], by means of physical interpretations, to refer to this [[natural]] theology that civil theology, concerning which he wrote [[last]] when treating of the select gods. now, if he has been able to do this, the whole is [[natural]]; and in that case, what need was there for distinguishing so carefully the civil from the [[natural]]? but if it has been distinguished by a veritable distinction, then, since not even this [[natural]] theology with which he is so much pleased is true (for though it has reached as far as the [[soul]], it has not reached to the true [[god]] who made the soul), how much more contemptible and false is that civil theology which is chiefly occupied about what is corporeal, as will be shown by its very interpretations, which they have with such diligence sought out and enucleated, some of which i must necessarily mention!

6. concerning the [[opinion]] of varro, that [[god]] is the [[soul]] of the [[world]], which nevertheless, in its various parts, has many souls [[soul]] whose [[nature]] is [[divine]].

the same varro, then, still speaking by anticipation, says that he thinks [[think]] that [[god]] is the [[soul]] of the [[world]] (which the greeks [[greek]] call κόσμος), and that this [[world]] itself is [[god]]; but as a [[wise]] [[man]], though he consists of [[body]] and [[mind]], is nevertheless called [[wise]] on account of his [[mind]], so the [[world]] is called [[god]] on account of [[mind]], although it consists of [[mind]] and [[body]]. here he seems, in some [[fashion]] at least, to acknowledge one [[god]]; but that he may introduce more, he adds that the [[world]] is divided into two parts, [[heaven]] and [[earth]], which are[pg 268] again divided each into two parts, [[heaven]] into ether and air, [[earth]] into water and [[land]], of all which the ether is the highest, the air second, the water third, and the [[earth]] the lowest. all these four parts, he says, are full of souls [[soul]]; those which are in the ether and air being [[immortal]], and those which are in the water and on the [[earth]] mortal. from the highest part of the heavens [[heaven]] to the orbit of the moon there are souls [[soul]], namely, the stars and planets; and these are not only understood to be gods, but are seen to be such. and between the orbit of the moon and the commencement of the region of clouds and winds there are aerial souls [[soul]]; but these are seen with the [[mind]], not with the [[eyes]], and are called heroes, and lares, and genii. this is the [[natural]] theology which is briefly set forth in these anticipatory statements, and which satisfied not varro only, but many [[philosophers]] besides. this i must discuss more carefully, when, with the [[help]] of [[god]], i shall have completed what i have yet to say concerning the civil theology, as far as it concerns the select gods.

7. whether it is reasonable to separate janus and terminus as two distinct deities.

who, then, is janus, with whom varro commences? he is the [[world]]. certainly a very brief and unambiguous reply. why, then, do they say that the beginnings of things pertain to him, but the ends to another whom they call terminus? for they say that two months have been dedicated to these two gods, with reference to beginnings and ends—january to janus, and february to terminus—over and above those ten months which commence with march and end with december. and they say that that is the [[reason]] why the terminalia are celebrated in the month of february, the same month in which the [[sacred]] purification is made which they call februum, and from which the month derives its name.[260] do the beginnings of things, therefore, pertain to the [[world]], which is janus, and not also the ends, since another god[pg 269] has been placed over them? do they not own that all things which they say begin in this [[world]] also come to an end in this [[world]]? what folly it is, to give him only half [[power]] in [[work]], when in his image they give him two faces! would it not be a far more elegant way of interpreting the two-faced image, to say that janus and terminus are the same, and that the one face has reference to beginnings, the other to ends? for one who works [[work]] ought to have [[respect]] to both. for he who in every forthputting of activity does not look back on the beginning, does not look forward to the end. wherefore it is necessary that prospective intention be connected with retrospective memory. for how shall one find how to finish anything, if he has forgotten what it was which he had begun? but if they [[thought]] that the blessed [[life]] is begun in this [[world]], and perfected beyond the [[world]], and for that [[reason]] attributed to janus, that is, to the [[world]], only the [[power]] of beginnings, they should certainly have preferred terminus to him, and should not have shut him out from the number of the select gods. yet even now, when the beginnings and ends of temporal things are represented by these two gods, more [[honour]] ought to have been given to terminus. for the greater joy is that which is [[felt]] when anything is finished; but things begun are always cause of much [[anxiety]] until they are brought to an end, which end he who begins anything very greatly longs for, fixes his [[mind]] on, expects, desires [[desire]]; nor does any one ever rejoice over anything he has begun, unless it be brought to an end.

8. for what [[reason]] the worshippers of janus have made his image with two faces, when they would sometimes have it be seen with four.

but now let the interpretation of the two-faced image be produced. for they say that it has two faces, one before and one behind, because our gaping mouths seem to resemble the [[world]]: whence the greeks [[greek]] call the palate οὐρανός, and some latin poets,[261] he says, have called the heavens [[heaven]] palatum [the palate]; and from the gaping mouth, they say, there is a way out in the direction of the teeth, and a way in in the direction of the gullet. see what the [[world]] has been brought to on account of a [[greek]] or a poetical word for our palate! let[pg 270] this [[god]] be worshipped only on account of saliva, which has two open doorways under the heavens [[heaven]] of the palate,—one through which part of it may be spitten out, the other through which part of it may be swallowed down. besides, what is more absurd than not to find in the [[world]] itself two doorways opposite to each other, through which it may either receive anything into itself, or cast it out from itself; and to seek of our throat and gullet, to which the [[world]] has no resemblance, to make up an image of the [[world]] in janus, because the [[world]] is said to resemble the palate, to which janus bears no likeness? but when they make him four-faced, and call him double janus, they interpret this as having reference to the four quarters of the [[world]], as though the [[world]] looked out on anything, like janus through his four faces. again, if janus is the [[world]], and the [[world]] consists of four quarters, then the image of the two-faced janus is false. or if it is true, because the whole [[world]] is sometimes understood by the expression east and west, will any one call the [[world]] double when north and south also are mentioned, as they call janus double when he has four faces? they have no way at all of interpreting, in relation to the [[world]], four doorways by which to go in and to come out as they did in the case of the two-faced janus, where they found, at any rate in the [[human]] mouth, something which answered to what they said about him; unless perhaps [[neptune]] come to their aid, and hand them a fish, which, besides the mouth and gullet, has also the openings of the gills, one on each side. nevertheless, with all the doors, no [[soul]] escapes this vanity but that one which hears the [[truth]] saying, "i am the door."[262]

9. concerning the [[power]] of [[jupiter]], and a comparison of [[jupiter]] with janus.

but they also show whom they would have jove (who is also called jupiter) understood to be. he is the [[god]], say they, who has the [[power]] of the causes by which anything comes to be in the [[world]]. and how [[great]] a thing this is, that most [[noble]] verse of [[virgil]] testifies:

"happy is he who has learned the causes of things."[263]
[pg 271]

but why is janus preferred to him? let that most acute and most learned [[man]] [[answer]] us this [[question]]. "because," says he, "janus has dominion over first things, [[jupiter]] over highest[264] things. therefore [[jupiter]] is deservedly held to be the [[king]] of all things; for highest things are [[better]] than first things: for although first things precede in [[time]], highest things excel by [[dignity]]."

now this would have been rightly said had the first parts of things which are done been distinguished from the highest parts; as, for instance, it is the beginning of a thing done to set out, the highest part to arrive. the commencing to learn is the first part of a thing begun, the acquirement of [[knowledge]] is the highest part. and so of all things: the beginnings are first, the ends highest. this matter, however, has been already discussed in connection with janus and terminus. but the causes which are attributed to [[jupiter]] are things effecting, not things effected; and it is impossible for them to be prevented in [[time]] by things which are made or done, or by the beginnings of such things; for the thing which makes is always prior to the thing which is made. therefore, though the beginnings of things which are made or done pertain to janus, they are nevertheless not prior to the efficient causes which they attribute to [[jupiter]]. for as nothing takes place without being preceded by an efficient cause, so without an efficient cause nothing begins to take place. verily, if the [[people]] call this [[god]] [[jupiter]], in whose [[power]] are all the causes of all natures [[nature]] which have been made, and of all [[natural]] things, and [[worship]] him with such insults and infamous criminations, they are guilty of more shocking sacrilege than if they should totally deny the existence of any [[god]]. it would therefore be [[better]] for them to call some other [[god]] by the name of jupiter—some one worthy of base and [[criminal]] honours [[honour]]; substituting instead of [[jupiter]] some [[vain]] fiction (as saturn is said to have had a stone given to him to devour instead of his son), which they might make the [[subject]] of their blasphemies, rather than speak of that [[god]] as both thundering and committing adultery,—ruling the whole [[world]], and laying himself out for the commission of so many licentious acts,—having in his[pg 272] [[power]] [[nature]] and the highest causes of all [[natural]] things, but not having his own causes [[good]].

next, i ask what place they find any longer for this [[jupiter]] among the gods, if janus is the [[world]]; for varro defined the true gods to be the [[soul]] of the [[world]], and the parts of it. and therefore whatever falls not within this definition, is certainly not a true [[god]], according to them. will they then say that [[jupiter]] is the [[soul]] of the [[world]], and janus the body—that is, this visible [[world]]? if they say this, it will not be possible for them to affirm that janus is a [[god]]. for even, according to them, the [[body]] of the [[world]] is not a [[god]], but the [[soul]] of the [[world]] and its parts. wherefore varro, seeing this, says that he thinks [[think]] [[god]] is the [[soul]] of the [[world]], and that this [[world]] itself is [[god]]; but that as a [[wise]] [[man]], though he consists of [[soul]] and [[body]], is nevertheless called [[wise]] from the [[soul]], so the [[world]] is called [[god]] from the [[soul]], though it consists of [[soul]] and [[body]]. therefore the [[body]] of the [[world]] alone is not [[god]], but either the [[soul]] of it alone, or the [[soul]] and the [[body]] together, yet so as that it is [[god]] not by [[virtue]] of the [[body]], but by [[virtue]] of the [[soul]]. if, therefore, janus is the [[world]], and janus is a [[god]], will they say, in order that [[jupiter]] may be a [[god]], that he is some part of janus? for they are wont rather to attribute universal existence to [[jupiter]]; whence the saying, "all things are full of [[jupiter]]."[265] therefore they must [[think]] [[jupiter]] also, in order that he may be a [[god]], and especially [[king]] of the gods, to be the [[world]], that he may [[rule]] over the other gods—according to them, his parts. to this effect, also, the same varro expounds [[certain]] verses of valerius soranus[266] in that [[book]] which he wrote apart from the others concerning the [[worship]] of the gods. these are the verses:

"almighty jove, progenitor of kings [[king]], and things, and gods, and eke the [[mother]] of the gods, [[god]] one and all."

but in the same [[book]] he expounds these verses by saying that as the male emits seed, and the female receives it, so [[jupiter]], whom they believed to be the [[world]], both emits all seeds from[pg 273] himself and receives them into himself. for which [[reason]], he says, soranus wrote, "jove, progenitor and [[mother]];" and with no less [[reason]] said that one and all were the same. for the [[world]] is one, and in that one are all things.

10. whether the distinction between janus and [[jupiter]] is a proper one.

since, therefore, janus is the [[world]], and [[jupiter]] is the [[world]], wherefore are janus and [[jupiter]] two gods, while the [[world]] is but one? why do they have separate temples, separate altars, different rites, dissimilar images? if it be because the [[nature]] of beginnings is one, and the [[nature]] of causes another, and the one has received the name of janus, the other of [[jupiter]]; is it then the case, that if one [[man]] has two distinct offices of [[authority]], or two [[arts]], two judges [[judge]] or two artificers are spoken of, because the [[nature]] of the offices or the [[arts]] is different? so also with [[respect]] to one [[god]]: if he have the [[power]] of beginnings and of causes, must he therefore be [[thought]] to be two gods, because beginnings and causes are two things? but if they [[think]] that this is [[right]], let them also affirm that [[jupiter]] is as many gods as they have given him surnames, on account of many powers [[power]]; for the things from which these surnames are applied to him are many and diverse. i shall mention a few of them.

11. concerning the surnames of [[jupiter]], which are referred not to many gods, but to one and the same [[god]].

they have called him victor, invictus, opitulus, impulsor, stator, centumpeda, supinalis, tigillus, almus, ruminus, and other names which it were long to enumerate. but these surnames they have given to one [[god]] on account of diverse causes and powers [[power]], but yet have not compelled him to be, on account of so many things, as many gods. they gave him these surnames because he conquered all things; because he was conquered by none; because he brought [[help]] to the needy; because he had the [[power]] of impelling, stopping, stablishing, throwing on the back; because as a beam[267] he held together and sustained the [[world]]; because he nourished all things; because, like the pap,[268] he nourished animals. here, we perceive, are some [[great]] things and some small things; and yet[pg 274] it is one who is said to perform them all. i [[think]] that the causes and the beginnings of things, on account of which they have [[thought]] that the one [[world]] is two gods, [[jupiter]] and janus, are nearer to each other than the holding together of the [[world]], and the giving of the pap to animals; and yet, on account of these two works [[work]] so far apart from each other, both in [[nature]] and [[dignity]], there has not been any necessity for the existence of two gods; but one [[jupiter]] has been called, on account of the one tigillus, on account of the other ruminus. i am unwilling to say that the giving of the pap to sucking animals might have become juno rather than [[jupiter]], especially when there was the [[goddess]] rumina to [[help]] and to serve her in this [[work]]; for i [[think]] it may be replied that juno herself is nothing else than [[jupiter]], according to those verses of valerius soranus, where it has been said:

"almighty jove, progenitor of kings [[king]], and things, and gods, and eke the [[mother]] of the gods," etc.

why, then, was he called ruminus, when they who may perchance inquire more diligently may find that he is also that [[goddess]] rumina?

if, then, it was rightly [[thought]] unworthy of the majesty of the gods, that in one ear of corn one [[god]] should have the [[care]] of the joint, another that of the husk, how much more unworthy of that majesty is it, that one thing, and that of the lowest [[kind]], even the giving of the pap to animals that they may be nourished, should be under the [[care]] of two gods, one of whom is [[jupiter]] himself, the very [[king]] of all things, who does this not along with his own [[wife]], but with some ignoble rumina (unless perhaps he himself is rumina, being ruminus for males and rumina for females)! i should certainly have said that they had been unwilling to apply to [[jupiter]] a feminine name, had he not been styled in these verses "progenitor and [[mother]]," and had i not [[read]] among other surnames of his that of pecunia [money], which we found as a [[goddess]] among those petty deities, as i have already mentioned in the fourth [[book]]. but since both males and females have [[money]] [pecuniam], why has he not been called both pecunius and pecunia? that is their concern.

[pg 275]

12. that [[jupiter]] is also called pecunia.

how elegantly they have accounted for this name! "he is also called pecunia," say they, "because all things belong to him." oh how grand an explanation of the name of a deity! yes; he to whom all things belong is most meanly and most contumeliously called pecunia. in comparison of all things which are contained by [[heaven]] and [[earth]], what are all things together which are possessed by [[men]] under the name of [[money]]?[269] and this name, forsooth, hath avarice given to [[jupiter]], that whoever was a lover of [[money]] might seem to himself to [[love]] not an ordinary [[god]], but the very [[king]] of all things himself. but it would be a far different thing if he had been called riches [[rich]]. for riches [[rich]] are one thing, [[money]] another. for we call [[rich]] the [[wise]], the just, the [[good]], who have either no [[money]] or very little. for they are more truly [[rich]] in possessing [[virtue]], since by it, even as respects [[respect]] things necessary for the [[body]], they are content with what they have. but we call the greedy [[poor]], who are always craving and always wanting. for they may possess ever so [[great]] an amount of [[money]]; but whatever be the abundance of that, they are not able but to want. and we properly call [[god]] himself [[rich]]; not, however, in [[money]], but in omnipotence. therefore they who have abundance of [[money]] are called [[rich]], but inwardly needy if they are greedy. so also, those who have no [[money]] are called [[poor]], but inwardly [[rich]] if they are [[wise]].

what, then, ought the [[wise]] [[man]] to [[think]] of this theology, in which the [[king]] of the gods receives the name of that thing "which no [[wise]] [[man]] has [[desired]]?"[270] for had there been anything wholesomely taught by this [[philosophy]] concerning eternal [[life]], how much more appropriately would that [[god]] who is the ruler of the [[world]] have been called by them, not [[money]], but [[wisdom]], the [[love]] of which purges from the filth of avarice, that is, of the [[love]] of money!

13. that when it is expounded what saturn is, what genius is, it comes to this, that both of them are shown to be [[jupiter]].

but why speak more of this [[jupiter]], with whom perchance[pg 276] all the rest are to be identified; so that, he being all, the [[opinion]] as to the existence of many gods may remain as a mere [[opinion]], empty of all [[truth]]? and they are all to be referred to him, if his various parts and powers [[power]] are [[thought]] of as so many gods, or if the [[principle]] of [[mind]] which they [[think]] to be diffused through all things has received the names of many gods from the various parts which the mass of this visible [[world]] combines in itself, and from the manifold administration of [[nature]]. for what is saturn also? "one of the principal gods," he says, "who has dominion over all sowings." does not the exposition of the verses of valerius soranus [[teach]] that [[jupiter]] is the [[world]], and that he emits all seeds from himself, and receives them into himself?

it is he, then, with whom is the dominion of all sowings. what is genius? "he is the [[god]] who is set over, and has the [[power]] of begetting, all things." who else than the [[world]] do they [[believe]] to have this [[power]], to which it has been said:

"almighty jove, progenitor and [[mother]]?"

and when in another place he says that genius is the [[rational]] [[soul]] of every one, and therefore exists separately in each [[individual]], but that the corresponding [[soul]] of the [[world]] is [[god]], he just comes back to this same thing,—namely, that the [[soul]] of the [[world]] itself is to be held to be, as it were, the universal genius. this, therefore, is what he calls [[jupiter]]. for if every genius is a [[god]], and the [[soul]] of every [[man]] a genius, it follows that the [[soul]] of every [[man]] is a [[god]]. but if very absurdity compels even these theologists themselves to shrink from this, it remains that they call that genius [[god]] by special and pre-eminent distinction, whom they call the [[soul]] of the [[world]], and therefore [[jupiter]].

14. concerning the offices of mercury and [[mars]].

but they have not found how to refer mercury and [[mars]] to any parts of the [[world]], and to the works [[work]] of [[god]] which are in the elements; and therefore they have set them at least over [[human]] works [[work]], making them assistants in speaking and in carrying on wars [[war]]. now mercury, if he has also the [[power]] of the [[speech]] of the gods, rules [[rule]] also over the [[king]] of the gods himself,[pg 277] if [[jupiter]], as he receives from him the faculty of [[speech]], also speaks according as it is his [[pleasure]] to permit him—which surely is absurd; but if it is only the [[power]] over [[human]] [[speech]] which is held to be attributed to him, then we say it is incredible that [[jupiter]] should have condescended to give the pap not only to [[children]], but also to beasts—from which he has been surnamed ruminus—and yet should have been unwilling that the [[care]] of our [[speech]], by which we excel the beasts, should pertain to him. and thus [[speech]] itself both belongs to [[jupiter]], and is mercury. but if [[speech]] itself is said to be mercury, as those things which are said concerning him by way of interpretation show it to be;—for he is said to have been called mercury, that is, he who runs between,[271] because [[speech]] runs between [[men]]: they say also that the greeks [[greek]] call him ἑρμῆς, because [[speech]], or interpretation, which certainly belongs to [[speech]], is called by them ἑρμηνεία: also he is said to preside over payments, because [[speech]] passes between sellers and buyers: the wings, too, which he has on his head and on his feet, they say, mean that [[speech]] passes winged through the air: he is also said to have been called the messenger,[272] because by means of [[speech]] all our thoughts [[thought]] are expressed;[273]—if, therefore, [[speech]] itself is mercury, then, even by their own [[confession]], he is not a [[god]]. but when they make to themselves gods of such as are not even demons, by praying to unclean spirits, they are possessed by such as are not gods, but demons. in like manner, because they have not been able to find for [[mars]] any element or part of the [[world]] in which he might perform some works [[work]] of [[nature]] of whatever [[kind]], they have said that he is the [[god]] of [[war]], which is a [[work]] of [[men]], and that not one which is considered desirable by them. if, therefore, felicitas should give perpetual [[peace]], [[mars]] would have nothing to do. but if [[war]] itself is [[mars]], as [[speech]] is mercury, i [[wish]] it were as true that there were no [[war]] to be falsely called a [[god]], as it is true that it is not a [[god]].

15. concerning [[certain]] stars which the pagans have called by the names of their gods.

but possibly these stars which have been called by their[pg 278] names are these gods. for they call a [[certain]] star mercury, and likewise a [[certain]] other star [[mars]]. but among those stars which are called by the names of gods, is that one which they call [[jupiter]], and yet with them [[jupiter]] is the [[world]]. there also is that one they call saturn, and yet they give to him no small [[property]] besides,—namely, all seeds. there also is that brightest of them all which is called by them [[venus]], and yet they will have this same [[venus]] to be also the moon:—not to mention how [[venus]] and juno are said by them to contend about that most brilliant star, as though about another golden apple. for some say that lucifer belongs to [[venus]], and some to juno. but, as usual, [[venus]] conquers. for by far the [[greatest]] number assign that star to [[venus]], so much so that there is scarcely found one of them who thinks [[think]] otherwise. but since they call [[jupiter]] the [[king]] of all, who will not laugh to see his star so far surpassed in brilliancy by the star of [[venus]]? for it ought to have been as much more brilliant than the rest, as he himself is more powerful. they [[answer]] that it only appears so because it is higher up, and very much farther away from the [[earth]]. if, therefore, its greater [[dignity]] has deserved a higher place, why is saturn higher in the heavens [[heaven]] than [[jupiter]]? was the vanity of the fable which made [[jupiter]] [[king]] not able to reach the stars? and has saturn been permitted to obtain at least in the heavens [[heaven]], what he could not obtain in his own [[kingdom]] nor in the capitol?

but why has janus received no star? if it is because he is the [[world]], and they are all in him, the [[world]] is also jupiter's, and yet he has one. did janus compromise his case as [[best]] he could, and instead of the one star which he does not have among the heavenly bodies [[body]], accept so many faces on [[earth]]? again, if they [[think]] that on account of the stars alone mercury and [[mars]] are parts of the [[world]], in order that they may be able to have them for gods, since [[speech]] and [[war]] are not parts of the [[world]], but acts of [[men]], how is it that they have made no altars, established no rites, built no temples for aries, and taurus, and cancer, and scorpio, and the rest which they number as the celestial signs, and which consist not of [[single]] stars, but each of them of many stars, which also they say are situated above those already[pg 279] mentioned in the highest part of the heavens [[heaven]], where a more constant motion causes the stars to [[follow]] an undeviating course? and why have they not reckoned them as gods, i do not say among those select gods, but not even among those, as it were, plebeian gods?

16. concerning [[apollo]] and diana, and the other select gods whom they would have to be parts of the [[world]].

although they would have [[apollo]] to be a diviner and physician, they have nevertheless given him a place as some part of the [[world]]. they have said that he is also the sun; and likewise they have said that diana, his sister, is the moon, and the guardian of roads. whence also they will have her be a virgin, because a road brings forth nothing. they also make both of them have arrows, because those two planets send their rays from the heavens [[heaven]] to the [[earth]]. they make vulcan to be the [[fire]] of the [[world]]; [[neptune]] the waters of the [[world]]; [[father]] dis, that is, orcus, the earthy and lowest part of the [[world]]. liber and ceres they set over seeds,—the former over the seeds of males, the latter over the seeds of females; or the one over the fluid part of seed, but the other over the dry part. and all this together is referred to the [[world]], that is, to [[jupiter]], who is called "progenitor and [[mother]]," because he emitted all seeds from himself, and received them into himself. for they also make this same ceres to be the [[great]] [[mother]], who they say is none other than the [[earth]], and call her also juno. and therefore they assign to her the second causes of things, notwithstanding that it has been said to [[jupiter]], "progenitor and [[mother]] of the gods;" because, according to them, the whole [[world]] itself is jupiter's. minerva, also, because they set her over [[human]] [[arts]], and did not find even a star in which to place her, has been said by them to be either the highest æther, or even the moon. also vesta herself they have [[thought]] to be the highest of the goddesses [[goddess]], because she is the [[earth]]; although they have [[thought]] that the milder [[fire]] of the [[world]], which is used for the ordinary purposes [[purpose]] of [[human]] [[life]], not the more [[violent]] [[fire]], such as belongs to vulcan, is to be assigned to her. and thus they will have all those select gods to be the [[world]] and its parts,—some of[pg 280] them the whole [[world]], others of them its parts; the whole of it [[jupiter]],—its parts, genius, mater magna, sol and luna, or rather [[apollo]] and diana, and so on. and sometimes they make one [[god]] many things; sometimes one thing many gods. many things are one [[god]] in the case of [[jupiter]]; for both the whole [[world]] is [[jupiter]], and the [[sky]] alone is [[jupiter]], and the star alone is said and held to be [[jupiter]]. juno also is mistress of second causes,—juno is the air, juno is the [[earth]]; and had she won it over [[venus]], juno would have been the star. likewise minerva is the highest æther, and minerva is likewise the moon, which they suppose to be in the lowest limit of the æther. and also they make one thing many gods in this way. the [[world]] is both janus and [[jupiter]]; also the [[earth]] is juno, and mater magna, and ceres.

17. that even varro himself pronounced his own opinions [[opinion]] regarding the gods ambiguous.

and the same is true with [[respect]] to all the rest, as is true with [[respect]] to those things which i have mentioned for the sake of [[example]]. they do not explain them, but rather involve them. they rush hither and thither, to this side or to that, according as they are driven by the impulse of erratic [[opinion]]; so that even varro himself has chosen rather to [[doubt]] concerning all things, than to affirm anything. for, having written the first of the three [[last]] books [[book]] concerning the [[certain]] gods, and having commenced in the second of these to speak of the uncertain gods, he says: "i ought not to be censured for having stated in this [[book]] the doubtful opinions [[opinion]] concerning the gods. for he who, when he has [[read]] them, shall [[think]] that they both ought to be, and can be, conclusively judged of, will do so himself. for my own part, i can be more easily [[led]] to [[doubt]] the things which i have written in the first [[book]], than to attempt to reduce all the things i shall write in this one to any orderly [[system]]." thus he makes uncertain not only that [[book]], concerning the uncertain gods, but also that other concerning the [[certain]] gods. moreover, in that third [[book]] concerning the select gods, after having exhibited by anticipation as much of the [[natural]] theology as he deemed necessary, and when about to commence[pg 281] to speak of the vanities and lying insanities of the civil theology, where he was not only without the guidance of the [[truth]] of things, but was also pressed by the [[authority]] of tradition, he says: "i will write in this [[book]] concerning the [[public]] gods of the roman [[people]], to whom they have dedicated temples, and whom they have conspicuously distinguished by many adornments; but, as xenophon of colophon writes, i will [[state]] what i [[think]], not what i am prepared to maintain: it is for [[man]] to [[think]] those things, for [[god]] to [[know]] them."

it is not, then, an account of things comprehended and most certainly believed which he promised, when about to write those things which were instituted by [[men]]. he only timidly promises an account of things which are but the [[subject]] of doubtful [[opinion]]. nor, indeed, was it possible for him to affirm with the same certainty that janus was the [[world]], and such like things; or to discover with the same certainty such things as how [[jupiter]] was the [[son]] of saturn, while saturn was made [[subject]] to him as [[king]]:—he could, i say, neither affirm nor discover such things with the same certainty with which he knew such things as that the [[world]] existed, that the heavens [[heaven]] and [[earth]] existed, the heavens [[heaven]] bright with stars, and the [[earth]] fertile through seeds; or with the same [[perfect]] conviction with which he believed that this universal mass of [[nature]] is governed and administered by a [[certain]] invisible and mighty [[force]].

18. a more credible cause of the rise of pagan error.

a far more credible account of these gods is given, when it is said that they were [[men]], and that to each one of them [[sacred]] rites and solemnities were instituted, according to his particular genius, manners, actions, circumstances; which rites and solemnities, by gradually creeping through the souls [[soul]] of [[men]], which are like demons, and eager for things which yield them [[sport]], were spread far and wide; the poets adorning them with lies [[lie]], and false spirits seducing [[men]] to receive them. for it is far more likely that some [[youth]], either impious himself, or afraid of being slain by an impious [[father]], being desirous to reign, dethroned his [[father]], than that (according[pg 282] to varro's interpretation) saturn was overthrown by his [[son]] [[jupiter]]; for cause, which belongs to [[jupiter]], is before seed, which belongs to saturn. for had this been so, saturn would never have been before [[jupiter]], nor would he have been the [[father]] of [[jupiter]]. for cause always precedes seed, and is never generated from seed. but when they seek to [[honour]] by [[natural]] interpretation most [[vain]] fables or deeds of [[men]], even the acutest [[men]] are so perplexed that we are compelled to grieve for their folly also.

19. concerning the interpretations which compose the [[reason]] of the [[worship]] of saturn.

they said, says varro, that saturn was wont to devour all that sprang from him, because seeds returned to the [[earth]] from whence they sprang. and when it is said that a lump of [[earth]] was put before saturn to be devoured instead of [[jupiter]], it is signified, he says, that before the art [[arts]] of ploughing was discovered, seeds were buried in the [[earth]] by the hands of [[men]]. the [[earth]] itself, then, and not seeds, should have been called saturn, because it in a manner devours what it has brought forth, when the seeds which have sprung from it return again into it. and what has saturn's receiving of a lump of [[earth]] instead of [[jupiter]] to do with this, that the seeds were covered in the soil by the hands of [[men]]? was the seed kept from being devoured, like other things, by being covered with the soil? for what they say would imply that he who put on the soil took away the seed, as [[jupiter]] is said to have been taken away when the lump of soil was offered to saturn instead of him, and not rather that the soil, by covering the seed, only caused it to be devoured the more eagerly. then, in that way, [[jupiter]] is the seed, and not the cause of the seed, as was said a little before.

but what shall [[men]] do who cannot find anything [[wise]] to say, because they are interpreting foolish things? saturn has a pruning-knife. that, says varro, is on account of agriculture. certainly in saturn's reign there as yet existed no agriculture, and therefore the former times [[time]] of saturn are spoken of, because, as the same varro interprets the fables, the primeval [[men]] lived on those seeds which the [[earth]] produced spontaneously. perhaps he received a pruning-knife[pg 283] when he had lost his sceptre; that he who had been a [[king]], and lived at ease during the first part of his [[time]], should become a laborious workman whilst his [[son]] occupied the [[throne]]. then he says that boys were wont to be immolated to him by [[certain]] peoples [[people]], the carthaginians for instance; and also that adults were immolated by some nations, for [[example]] the gauls—because, of all seeds, the [[human]] [[race]] is the [[best]]. what need we say more concerning this most cruel vanity? let us rather attend to and hold by this, that these interpretations are not carried up to the true [[god]],—a living, incorporeal, unchangeable [[nature]], from whom a blessed [[life]] enduring for ever may be obtained,—but that they end in things which are corporeal, temporal, mutable, and mortal. and whereas it is said in the fables that saturn castrated his [[father]] cœlus, this signifies, says varro, that the [[divine]] seed belongs to saturn, and not to cœlus; for this [[reason]], as far as a [[reason]] can be discovered, namely, that in heaven[274] nothing is born from seed. but, lo! saturn, if he is the [[son]] of cœlus, is the [[son]] of [[jupiter]]. for they affirm times [[time]] without number, and that emphatically, that the heavens[275] are [[jupiter]]. thus those things which come not of the [[truth]], do very often, without being impelled by any one, themselves overthrow one another. he says that saturn was called κρόνος, which in the [[greek]] tongue signifies a space of [[time]],[276] because, without that, seed cannot be productive. these and many other things are said concerning saturn, and they are all referred to seed. but saturn surely, with all that [[great]] [[power]], might have sufficed for seed. why are other gods demanded for it, especially liber and libera, that is, ceres?—concerning whom again, as far as seed is concerned, he says as many things as if he had said nothing concerning saturn.

20. concerning the rites of eleusinian ceres.

now among the rites of ceres, those eleusinian rites are much famed which were in the highest repute among the athenians, of which varro offers no interpretation except with [[respect]] to corn, which ceres discovered, and with [[respect]] to proserpine, whom ceres lost, orcus having carried her[pg 284] away. and this proserpine herself, he says, signifies the fecundity of seeds. but as this fecundity departed at a [[certain]] season, whilst the [[earth]] wore an aspect of [[sorrow]] through the consequent sterility, there arose an [[opinion]] that the [[daughter]] of ceres, that is, fecundity itself, who was called proserpine, from proserpere (to creep forth, to spring), had been carried away by orcus, and detained among the inhabitants of the nether [[world]]; which circumstance was celebrated with [[public]] mourning. but since the same fecundity again returned, there arose joy because proserpine had been given back by orcus, and thus these rites were instituted. then varro adds, that many things are taught in the mysteries of ceres which only refer to the discovery of fruits.

21. concerning the shamefulness of the rites which are celebrated in [[honour]] of liber.

now as to the rites of liber, whom they have set over liquid seeds, and therefore not only over the liquors of fruits, among which wine holds, so to speak, the primacy, but also over the seeds of animals:—as to these rites, i am unwilling to undertake to show to what excess of turpitude they had reached, because that would entail a lengthened discourse, though i am not unwilling to do so as a demonstration of the proud stupidity of those who practise them. among other rites which i am compelled from the greatness of their number to omit, varro says that in [[italy]], at the places where roads crossed each other, the rites of liber were celebrated with such unrestrained turpitude, that the private parts of a [[man]] were worshipped in his [[honour]]. nor was this abomination transacted in secret, that some regard at least might be paid to modesty, but was openly and wantonly displayed. for during the festival of liber, this obscene member, placed on a car, was carried with [[great]] [[honour]], first over the cross-roads in the [[country]], and then into the [[city]]. but in the town of lavinium a whole month was devoted to liber alone, during the days of which all the [[people]] gave themselves up to the most dissolute conversation, until that member had been carried through the forum and brought to rest in its own place; on which unseemly member it was necessary that[pg 285] the most honourable matron should place a wreath in the presence of all the [[people]]. thus, forsooth, was the [[god]] liber to be appeased in order to the [[growth]] of seeds. thus was enchantment to be driven away from fields, even by a matron's being compelled to do in [[public]] what not even a harlot ought to be permitted to do in a theatre, if there were matrons among the spectators. for these reasons [[reason]], then, saturn alone was not believed to be sufficient for seeds,—namely, that the impure [[mind]] might find occasions [[occasion]] for multiplying the gods; and that, being righteously abandoned to uncleanness by the one true [[god]], and being prostituted to the [[worship]] of many false gods, through an avidity for ever greater and greater uncleanness, it should call these sacrilegious rites [[sacred]] things, and should abandon itself to be violated and polluted by crowds of foul demons.

22. concerning [[neptune]], and salacia, and venilia.

now [[neptune]] had salacia to [[wife]], who they say is the nether waters of the sea. wherefore was venilia also joined to him? was it not simply through the [[lust]] of the [[soul]] desiring a greater number of demons to whom to prostitute itself, and not because this [[goddess]] was necessary to the [[perfection]] of their [[sacred]] rites? but let the interpretation of this illustrious theology be brought forward to restrain us from this censuring by rendering a satisfactory [[reason]]. venilia, says this theology, is the wave which comes to the shore, salacia the wave which returns into the sea. why, then, are there two goddesses [[goddess]], when it is one wave which comes and returns? certainly it is mad [[lust]] itself, which in its eagerness for many deities resembles the waves which break on the shore. for though the water which goes is not different from that which returns, still the [[soul]] which goes and returns not is defiled by two demons, whom it has taken [[occasion]] by this false pretext to invite. i ask thee, o varro, and you who have [[read]] such works [[work]] of learned [[men]], and [[think]] ye have learned something [[great]],—i ask you to interpret this, i do not say in a manner consistent with the eternal and unchangeable [[nature]] which alone is [[god]], but only in a manner consistent with the doctrine concerning the [[soul]] of the [[world]] and its[pg 286] parts, which ye [[think]] to be the true gods. it is a somewhat more tolerable thing that ye have made that part of the [[soul]] of the [[world]] which pervades the sea your [[god]] [[neptune]]. is the wave, then, which comes to the shore and returns to the main, two parts of the [[world]], or two parts of the [[soul]] of the [[world]]? who of you is so silly as to [[think]] so? why, then, have they made to you two goddesses [[goddess]]? the only [[reason]] seems to be, that your [[wise]] [[ancestors]] have provided, not that many gods should [[rule]] you, but that many of such demons as are delighted with those vanities and falsehoods should possess you. but why has that salacia, according to this interpretation, lost the lower part of the sea, seeing that she was represented as [[subject]] to her husband? for in saying that she is the receding wave, ye have put her on the surface. was she enraged at her husband for taking venilia as a concubine, and thus drove him from the upper part of the sea?

23. concerning the [[earth]], which varro affirms to be a [[goddess]], because that [[soul]] of the [[world]] which he thinks [[think]] to be [[god]] pervades also this lowest part of his [[body]], and imparts to it a [[divine]] [[force]].

surely the [[earth]], which we see full of its own living creatures, is one; but for all that, it is but a mighty mass among the elements, and the lowest part of the [[world]]. why, then, would they have it to be a [[goddess]]? is it because it is fruitful? why, then, are not [[men]] rather held to be gods, who render it fruitful by cultivating it; but though they plough it, do not adore it? but, say they, the part of the [[soul]] of the [[world]] which pervades it makes it a [[goddess]]. as if it were not a far more evident thing, nay, a thing which is not called in [[question]], that there is a [[soul]] in [[man]]. and yet [[men]] are not held to be gods, but (a thing to be sadly lamented), with wonderful and pitiful delusion, are subjected to those who are not gods, and than whom they themselves are [[better]], as the objects of deserved [[worship]] and adoration. and certainly the same varro, in the [[book]] concerning the select gods, affirms that there are three grades of [[soul]] in universal [[nature]]. one which pervades all the living parts of the [[body]], and has not sensation, but only the [[power]] of [[life]],—that [[principle]] which penetrates into the bones, nails, and hair. by this [[principle]] in the [[world]] trees are nourished, and grow without being possessed[pg 287] of sensation, and [[live]] in a manner peculiar to themselves. the second grade of [[soul]] is that in which there is sensation. this [[principle]] penetrates into the [[eyes]], ears, nostrils, mouth, and the organs of sensation. the third grade of [[soul]] is the highest, and is called [[mind]], where [[intelligence]] has its [[throne]]. this grade of [[soul]] no mortal creatures except [[man]] are possessed of. now this part of the [[soul]] of the [[world]], varro says, is called [[god]], and in us is called genius. and the stones and [[earth]] in the [[world]], which we see, and which are not pervaded by the [[power]] of sensation, are, as it were, the bones and nails of [[god]]. again, the sun, moon, and stars, which we perceive, and by which he perceives, are his organs of perception. moreover, the ether is his [[mind]]; and by the [[virtue]] which is in it, which penetrates into the stars, it also makes them gods; and because it penetrates through them into the [[earth]], it makes it the [[goddess]] tellus, whence again it enters and permeates the sea and ocean, making them the [[god]] [[neptune]].

let him return from this, which he thinks [[think]] to be [[natural]] theology, back to that from which he went out, in order to rest from the fatigue occasioned by the many turnings and windings of his path. let him return, i say, let him return to the civil theology. i [[wish]] to detain him there a while. i have somewhat to say which has to do with that theology. i am not yet saying, that if the [[earth]] and stones are similar to our bones and nails, they are in like manner devoid of [[intelligence]], as they are devoid of sensation. nor am i saying that, if our bones and nails are said to have [[intelligence]], because they are in a [[man]] who has [[intelligence]], he who says that the things analogous to these in the [[world]] are gods, is as stupid as he is who says that our bones and nails are [[men]]. we shall perhaps have [[occasion]] to dispute these things with the [[philosophers]]. at [[present]], however, i [[wish]] to deal with varro as a [[political]] theologian. for it is possible that, though he may seem to have wished to lift up his head, as it were, into the [[liberty]] of [[natural]] theology, the [[consciousness]] that the [[book]] with which he was occupied was one concerning a [[subject]] belonging to civil theology, may have caused him to relapse into the point of view of that theology, and to[pg 288] say this in order that the [[ancestors]] of his nation, and other states, might not be believed to have bestowed on [[neptune]] an irrational [[worship]]. what i am to say is this: since the [[earth]] is one, why has not that part of the [[soul]] of the [[world]] which permeates the [[earth]] made it that one [[goddess]] which he calls tellus? but had it done so, what then had become of orcus, the [[brother]] of [[jupiter]] and [[neptune]], whom they call [[father]] dis?[277] and where, in that case, had been his [[wife]] proserpine, who, according to another [[opinion]] given in the same [[book]], is called, not the fecundity of the [[earth]], but its lower part?[278] but if they say that part of the [[soul]] of the [[world]], when it permeates the upper part of the [[earth]], makes the [[god]] [[father]] dis, but when it pervades the nether part of the same the [[goddess]] proserpine; what, in that case, will that tellus be? for all that which she was has been divided into these two parts, and these two gods; so that it is impossible to find what to make or where to place her as a third [[goddess]], except it be said that those divinities orcus and proserpine are the one [[goddess]] tellus, and that they are not three gods, but one or two, whilst notwithstanding they are called three, held to be three, worshipped as three, having their own several altars, their own shrines, rites, images, priests [[priest]], whilst their own false demons also through these things defile the prostituted [[soul]]. let this further [[question]] be answered: what part of the [[earth]] does a part of the [[soul]] of the [[world]] permeate in order to make the [[god]] tellumo? no, says he; but the [[earth]] being one and the same, has a double [[life]],—the masculine, which produces [[produce]] seed, and the feminine, which receives and nourishes the seed. hence it has been called tellus from the feminine [[principle]], and tellumo from the masculine. why, then, do the priests [[priest]], as he indicates, perform [[divine]] service to four gods, two others being added,—namely, to tellus, tellumo, altor, and rusor? we have already spoken concerning tellus and tellumo. but why do they [[worship]] altor?[279] because, says he, all that springs of the [[earth]] is nourished by the [[earth]]. wherefore do they [[worship]] rusor?[280] because all things return back again to the place whence they proceeded.

[pg 289]

24. concerning the surnames of tellus and their significations, which, although they indicate many properties [[property]], ought not to have established the [[opinion]] that there is a corresponding number of gods.

the one [[earth]], then, on account of this fourfold [[virtue]], ought to have had four surnames, but not to have been considered as four gods,—as [[jupiter]] and juno, though they have so many surnames, are for all that only [[single]] deities,—for by all these surnames it is signified that a manifold [[virtue]] belongs to one [[god]] or to one [[goddess]]; but the multitude of surnames does not imply a multitude of gods. but as sometimes even the vilest [[women]] themselves grow tired of those crowds which they have sought after under the impulse of wicked passion, so also the [[soul]], become vile, and prostituted to impure spirits, sometimes begins to loathe to multiply to itself gods to whom to [[surrender]] itself to be polluted by them, as much as it once delighted in so doing. for varro himself, as if ashamed of that crowd of gods, would make tellus to be one [[goddess]]. "they say," says he, "that whereas the one [[great]] [[mother]] has a tympanum, it is signified that she is the orb of the [[earth]]; whereas she has towers on her head, towns are signified; and whereas seats are fixed round about her, it is signified that whilst all things move, she moves not. and their having made the galli to serve this [[goddess]], signifies that they who are in need of seed ought to [[follow]] the [[earth]], for in it all seeds are found. by their throwing themselves down before her, it is taught," he says, "that they who cultivate the [[earth]] should not sit idle, for there is always something for them to do. the sound of the cymbals signifies the noise made by the throwing of iron utensils, and by men's hands, and all other noises connected with agricultural operations; and these cymbals are of brass, because the ancients used brazen utensils in their agriculture before iron was discovered. they place beside the [[goddess]] an unbound and tame lion, to show that there is no [[kind]] of [[land]] so wild and so excessively barren as that it would be profitless to attempt to bring it in and cultivate it." then he adds that, because they gave many names and surnames to [[mother]] tellus, it came to be [[thought]] that these signified many gods. "they [[think]]," says he, "that tellus is ops, because the [[earth]] is improved[pg 290] by [[labour]]; [[mother]], because it brings forth much; [[great]], because it brings forth seed; proserpine, because fruits creep forth from it; vesta, because it is invested with herbs. and thus," says he, "they not at all absurdly identify other goddesses [[goddess]] with the [[earth]]." if, then, it is one [[goddess]] (though, if the [[truth]] were consulted, it is not even that), why do they nevertheless separate it into many? let there be many names of one [[goddess]], and let there not be as many goddesses [[goddess]] as there are names.

but the [[authority]] of the erring ancients weighs heavily on varro, and compels him, after having expressed this [[opinion]], to show signs of uneasiness; for he immediately adds, "with which things the [[opinion]] of the ancients, who [[thought]] that there were really many goddesses [[goddess]], does not conflict." how does it not conflict, when it is entirely a different thing to say that one [[goddess]] has many names, and to say that there are many goddesses [[goddess]]? but it is possible, he says, that the same thing may both be one, and yet have in it a plurality of things. i grant that there are many things in one [[man]]; are there therefore in him many [[men]]? in like manner, in one [[goddess]] there are many things; are there therefore also many goddesses [[goddess]]? but let them divide, unite, multiply, reduplicate, and implicate as they like.

these are the famous mysteries of tellus and the [[great]] [[mother]], all of which are shown to have reference to mortal seeds and to agriculture. do these things, then,—namely, the tympanum, the towers, the galli, the tossing to and fro of limbs, the noise of cymbals, the images of lions,—do these things, having this reference and this end, promise eternal [[life]]? do the mutilated galli, then, serve this [[great]] [[mother]] in order to signify that they who are in need of seed should [[follow]] the [[earth]], as though it were not rather the case that this very service caused them to want seed? for whether do they, by following this [[goddess]], acquire seed, being in want of it, or, by following her, lose seed when they have it? is this to interpret or to deprecate? nor is it considered to what a [[degree]] malign demons have gained the upper hand, inasmuch as they have been able to exact such cruel rites without having dared to promise any [[great]] things in return for them. had[pg 291] the [[earth]] not been a [[goddess]], [[men]] would have, by labouring, laid their hands on it in order to obtain seed through it, and would not have laid [[violent]] hands on themselves in order to lose seed on account of it. had it not been a [[goddess]], it would have become so fertile by the hands of others, that it would not have compelled a [[man]] to be rendered barren by his own hands; nor that in the festival of liber an honourable matron put a wreath on the private parts of a [[man]] in the sight of the multitude, where perhaps her husband was standing by blushing and perspiring, if there is any shame left in [[men]]; and that in the celebration of marriages [[marriage]] the newly-married bride was ordered to sit upon priapus. these things are [[bad]] enough, but they are small and contemptible in comparison with that most cruel abomination, or most abominable [[cruelty]], by which either set is so deluded that neither perishes of its wound. there the enchantment of fields is feared; here the amputation of members is not feared. there the modesty of the bride is outraged, but in such a manner as that neither her fruitfulness nor even her virginity is taken away; here a [[man]] is so mutilated that he is neither changed into a woman nor remains a [[man]].

25. the interpretation of the mutilation of atys which the doctrine of the [[greek]] sages set forth.

varro has not spoken of that atys, nor sought out any interpretation for him, in memory of whose being loved by ceres the gallus is mutilated. but the learned and [[wise]] greeks [[greek]] have by no means been silent about an interpretation so holy and so illustrious. the celebrated philosopher porphyry has said that atys signifies the flowers of spring, which is the most beautiful season, and therefore was mutilated because the flower falls before the fruit appears.[281] they have not, then, compared the [[man]] himself, or rather that semblance of a [[man]] they called atys, to the flower, but his male organs,—these, indeed, fell whilst he was living. did i say fell? nay, truly they did not fall, nor were they plucked off, but torn away. nor when that flower was lost did any fruit [[follow]], but rather sterility. what, then, do they say is signified by the castrated atys himself, and whatever remained[pg 292] to him after his castration? to what do they refer that? what interpretation does that give rise to? do they, after [[vain]] endeavours to discover an interpretation, seek to persuade [[men]] that that is rather to be believed which report has made [[public]], and which has also been written concerning his having been a mutilated [[man]]? our varro has very properly opposed this, and has been unwilling to [[state]] it; for it certainly was not unknown to that most learned [[man]].

26. concerning the abomination of the [[sacred]] rites of the [[great]] [[mother]].

concerning the effeminates consecrated to the same [[great]] [[mother]], in defiance of all the modesty which belongs to [[men]] and [[women]], varro has not wished to say anything, nor do i [[remember]] to have [[read]] anywhere aught concerning them. these effeminates, no later than yesterday, were going through the streets and places of [[carthage]] with anointed hair, whitened faces, relaxed bodies [[body]], and feminine gait, exacting from the [[people]] the means of maintaining their ignominious lives [[life]]. nothing has been said concerning them. interpretation failed, [[reason]] blushed, [[speech]] was silent. the [[great]] [[mother]] has surpassed all her sons [[son]], not in greatness of deity, but of crime. to this monster not even the monstrosity of janus is to be compared. his deformity was only in his image; hers was the deformity of [[cruelty]] in her [[sacred]] rites. he has a redundancy of members in stone images; she inflicts the loss of members on [[men]]. this abomination is not surpassed by the licentious deeds of [[jupiter]], so many and so [[great]]. he, with all his seductions of [[women]], only disgraced [[heaven]] with one ganymede; she, with so many avowed and [[public]] effeminates, has both defiled the [[earth]] and outraged [[heaven]]. perhaps we may either compare saturn to this magna mater, or even set him before her in this [[kind]] of abominable [[cruelty]], for he mutilated his [[father]]. but at the festivals of saturn [[men]] could rather be slain by the hands of others than mutilated by their own. he devoured his sons [[son]], as the poets say, and the [[natural]] theologists interpret this as they list. [[history]] says he slew them. but the romans never received, like the carthaginians, the custom of sacrificing their sons [[son]] to him. this [[great]] [[mother]] of the gods, however, has brought[pg 293] mutilated [[men]] into roman temples, and has preserved that cruel custom, being believed to promote the [[strength]] of the romans by emasculating their [[men]]. compared with this [[evil]], what are the thefts of mercury, the wantonness of [[venus]], and the base and flagitious deeds of the rest of them, which we might bring forward from books [[book]], were it not that they are daily sung and danced in the theatres? but what are these things to so [[great]] an [[evil]],—an [[evil]] whose magnitude was only proportioned to the greatness of the [[great]] [[mother]],—especially as these are said to have been [[invented]] by the poets? as if the poets had also [[invented]] this, that they are acceptable to the gods. let it be imputed, then, to the audacity and impudence of the poets that these things have been sung and written of. but that they have been incorporated into the [[body]] of [[divine]] rites and honours [[honour]], the deities themselves demanding and extorting that incorporation, what is that but the crime of the gods? nay more, the [[confession]] of demons and the deception of wretched [[men]]? but as to this, that the [[great]] [[mother]] is considered to be worshipped in the appropriate form when she is worshipped by the consecration of mutilated [[men]], this is not an invention of the poets, nay, they have rather shrunk from it with [[horror]] than sung of it. ought any one, then, to be consecrated to these select gods, that he may [[live]] blessedly after [[death]], consecrated to whom he could not [[live]] decently before [[death]], being subjected to such foul superstitions, and bound over to unclean demons? but all these things, says varro, are to be referred to the [[world]].[282] let him consider if it be not rather to the unclean.[283] but why not refer that to the [[world]] which is demonstrated to be in the [[world]]? we, however, seek for a [[mind]] which, trusting to true [[religion]], does not adore the [[world]] as its [[god]], but for the sake of [[god]] praises [[praise]] the [[world]] as a [[work]] of [[god]], and, purified from mundane defilements, comes pure[284] to [[god]] himself who founded the [[world]].[285]

27. concerning the figments of the physical theologists, who neither [[worship]] the true divinity, nor perform the [[worship]] wherewith the true divinity should be served.

we see that these select gods have, indeed, become more[pg 294] famous than the rest; not, however, that their merits [[merit]] may be brought to [[light]], but that their opprobrious deeds may not be hid. whence it is more credible that they were [[men]], as not only poetic but also historical literature has handed down. for this which [[virgil]] says,

"then from olympus' heights came down [[good]] saturn, exiled from his [[throne]] by jove, his mightier heir;"[286]
and what follows with reference to this affair, is fully related by the historian euhemerus, and has been translated into latin by ennius. and as they who have written before us in the [[greek]] or in the latin tongue against such errors as these have said much concerning this matter, i have [[thought]] it unnecessary to dwell upon it. when i consider those physical reasons [[reason]], then, by which learned and acute [[men]] attempt to turn [[human]] things into [[divine]] things, all i see is that they have been able to refer these things only to temporal works [[work]] and to that which has a corporeal [[nature]], and even though invisible still mutable; and this is by no means the true [[god]]. but if this [[worship]] had been performed as the symbolism of ideas [[idea]] at least congruous with [[religion]], though it would indeed have been cause of [[grief]] that the true [[god]] was not announced and proclaimed by its symbolism, nevertheless it could have been in some [[degree]] borne with, when it did not [[occasion]] and command the performance of such foul and abominable things. but since it is impiety to [[worship]] the [[body]] or the [[soul]] for the true [[god]], by whose indwelling alone the [[soul]] is [[happy]], how much more impious is it to [[worship]] those things through which neither [[soul]] nor [[body]] can obtain either salvation or [[human]] [[honour]]? wherefore if with temple, [[priest]], and [[sacrifice]], which are due to the true [[god]], any element of the [[world]] be worshipped, or any created spirit, even though not impure and [[evil]], that [[worship]] is still [[evil]], not because the things are [[evil]] by which the [[worship]] is performed, but because those things ought only to be used in the [[worship]] of him to whom alone such [[worship]] and service are due. but if any one insist that he worships the one true [[god]],—that is, the creator of every [[soul]] and of every [[body]],—with stupid and[pg 295] monstrous idols, with [[human]] victims, with putting a wreath on the male organ, with the wages of unchastity, with the cutting of limbs, with emasculation, with the consecration of effeminates, with impure and obscene plays, such a one does not [[sin]] because he worships one who ought not to be worshipped, but because he worships him who ought to be worshipped in a way in which he ought not to be worshipped. but he who worships with such things,—that is, foul and obscene things,—and that not the true [[god]], namely, the maker of [[soul]] and [[body]], but a creature, even though not a wicked creature, whether it be [[soul]] or [[body]], or [[soul]] and [[body]] together, twice sins [[sin]] against [[god]], because he both worships for [[god]] what is not [[god]], and also worships with such things as neither [[god]] nor what is not [[god]] ought to be worshipped with. it is, indeed, manifest how these pagans [[worship]],—that is, how shamefully and criminally they [[worship]]; but what or whom they [[worship]] would have been left in obscurity, had not their [[history]] testified that those same confessedly base and foul rites were rendered in [[obedience]] to the demands of the gods, who exacted them with terrible severity. wherefore it is evident beyond [[doubt]] that this whole civil theology is occupied in inventing means for attracting wicked and most impure spirits, inviting them to visit senseless images, and through these to take possession of stupid hearts [[heart]].

28. that the doctrine of varro concerning theology is in no part consistent with itself.

to what [[purpose]], then, is it that this most learned and most acute [[man]] varro attempts, as it were, with subtle disputation, to reduce and refer all these gods to [[heaven]] and [[earth]]? he cannot do it. they go out of his hands like water; they shrink back; they slip down and fall. for when about to speak of the females, that is, the goddesses [[goddess]], he says, "since, as i observed in the first [[book]] concerning places, [[heaven]] and [[earth]] are the two origins of the gods, on which account they are called celestials and terrestrials, and as i began in the former books [[book]] with [[heaven]], speaking of janus, whom some have said to be [[heaven]], and others the [[earth]], so i now commence with tellus in speaking concerning the goddesses [[goddess]]." i can [[understand]] what embarrassment so [[great]] a [[mind]] was experiencing.[pg 296] for he is influenced by the perception of a [[certain]] plausible resemblance, when he says that the [[heaven]] is that which does, and the [[earth]] that which suffers, and therefore attributes the masculine [[principle]] to the one, and the feminine to the other,—not considering that it is rather he who made both [[heaven]] and [[earth]] who is the maker of both activity and passivity. on this [[principle]] he interprets the celebrated mysteries of the samothracians, and promises, with an air of [[great]] devoutness, that he will by writing expound these mysteries, which have not been so much as known to his countrymen, and will send them his exposition. then he says that he had from many proofs gathered that, in those mysteries, among the images one signifies [[heaven]], another the [[earth]], another the patterns of things, which [[plato]] calls ideas [[idea]]. he makes [[jupiter]] to signify [[heaven]], juno the [[earth]], minerva the ideas [[idea]]. [[heaven]], by which anything is made; the [[earth]], from which it is made; and the pattern, according to which it is made. but, with [[respect]] to the [[last]], i am forgetting to say that [[plato]] attributed so [[great]] an importance to these ideas [[idea]] as to say, not that anything was made by [[heaven]] according to them, but that according to them [[heaven]] itself was made.[287] to return, however,—it is to be observed that varro has, in the [[book]] on the select gods, lost that theory of these gods, in whom he has, as it were, embraced all things. for he assigns the male gods to [[heaven]], the females to [[earth]]; among which latter he has placed minerva, whom he had before placed above [[heaven]] itself. then the male [[god]] [[neptune]] is in the sea, which pertains rather to [[earth]] than to [[heaven]]. [[last]] of all, [[father]] dis, who is called in [[greek]] πλούτων, another male [[god]], [[brother]] of both (jupiter and neptune), is also held to be a [[god]] of the [[earth]], holding the upper region of the [[earth]] himself, and allotting the nether region to his [[wife]] proserpine. how, then, do they attempt to refer the gods to [[heaven]], and the goddesses [[goddess]] to [[earth]]? what solidity, what consistency, what sobriety has this disputation? but that tellus is the origin of the goddesses [[goddess]],—the [[great]] [[mother]], to wit, beside whom there is continually the noise of the mad and abominable revelry of effeminates and mutilated [[men]], and [[men]] who cut[pg 297] themselves, and indulge in frantic gesticulations,—how is it, then, that janus is called the head of the gods, and tellus the head of the goddesses [[goddess]]? in the one case error does not make one head, and in the other frenzy does not make a sane one. why do they vainly attempt to refer these to the [[world]]? even if they could do so, no pious [[person]] worships the [[world]] for the true [[god]]. nevertheless, plain [[truth]] makes it evident that they are not able even to do this. let them rather identify them with [[dead]] [[men]] and most wicked demons, and no further [[question]] will remain.

29. that all things which the physical theologists have referred to the [[world]] and its parts, they ought to have referred to the one true [[god]].

for all those things which, according to the account given of those gods, are referred to the [[world]] by so-called physical interpretation, may, without any [[religious]] scruple, be rather assigned to the true [[god]], who made [[heaven]] and [[earth]], and created every [[soul]] and every [[body]]; and the following is the manner in which we see that this may be done. we [[worship]] [[god]],—not [[heaven]] and [[earth]], of which two parts this [[world]] consists, nor the [[soul]] or souls [[soul]] diffused through all living things,—but [[god]] who made [[heaven]] and [[earth]], and all things which are in them; who made every [[soul]], whatever be the [[nature]] of its [[life]], whether it have [[life]] without sensation and [[reason]], or [[life]] with sensation, or [[life]] with both sensation and [[reason]].

30. how piety distinguishes the creator from the creatures, so that, instead of one [[god]], there are not worshipped as many gods as there are works [[work]] of the one author.

and now, to begin to go over those works [[work]] of the one true [[god]], on account of which these have made to themselves many and false gods, whilst they attempt to give an honourable interpretation to their many most abominable and most infamous mysteries,—we [[worship]] that [[god]] who has appointed to the natures [[nature]] created by him both the beginnings and the end of their existing and moving; who holds, knows [[know]], and disposes the causes of things; who hath created the [[virtue]] of seeds; who hath given to what creatures he would a [[rational]] [[soul]], which is called [[mind]]; who hath bestowed the faculty and use of [[speech]]; who hath imparted the gift of foretelling future[pg 298] things to whatever spirits it seemed to him [[good]]; who also himself predicts future things, through whom he pleases, and through whom he will removes diseases; who, when the [[human]] [[race]] is to be corrected and chastised by wars [[war]], regulates also the beginnings, [[progress]], and ends of these wars [[war]]; who hath created and governs the most vehement and most [[violent]] [[fire]] of this [[world]], in due relation and proportion to the other elements of immense [[nature]]; who is the governor of all the waters; who hath made the sun brightest of all material lights [[light]], and hath given him suitable [[power]] and motion; who hath not withdrawn, even from the inhabitants of the nether [[world]], his dominion and [[power]]; who hath appointed to mortal natures [[nature]] their suitable seed and nourishment, dry or liquid; who establishes and makes fruitful the [[earth]]; who bountifully bestows its fruits on animals and on [[men]]; who knows [[know]] and ordains, not only principal causes, but also subsequent causes; who hath determined for the moon her motion; who affords ways in [[heaven]] and on [[earth]] for passage from one place to another; who hath granted also to [[human]] minds [[mind]], which he hath created, the [[knowledge]] of the various [[arts]] for the [[help]] of [[life]] and [[nature]]; who hath appointed the union of male and female for the propagation of offspring; who hath favoured the societies [[society]] of [[men]] with the gift of terrestrial [[fire]] for the simplest and most familiar purposes [[purpose]], to burn on the hearth and to give [[light]]. these are, then, the things which that most acute and most learned [[man]] varro has laboured to distribute among the select gods, by i [[know]] not what physical interpretation, which he has got from other sources, and also conjectured for himself. but these things the one true [[god]] makes and does, but as the same [[god]],—that is, as he who is wholly everywhere, included in no space, bound by no chains, mutable in no part of his being, filling [[heaven]] and [[earth]] with omnipresent [[power]], not with a needy [[nature]]. therefore he governs all things in such a manner as to allow them to perform and exercise their own proper movements. for although they can be nothing without him, they are not what he is. he does also many things through angels; but only from himself does he beatify angels. so also, though he send angels to [[men]] for [[certain]] purposes [[purpose]],[pg 299] he does not for all that beatify [[men]] by the [[good]] inherent in the angels, but by himself, as he does the angels themselves.

31. what benefits [[god]] gives to the followers of the [[truth]] to enjoy over and above his general bounty.

for, besides such benefits as, according to this administration of [[nature]] of which we have made some mention, he lavishes on [[good]] and [[bad]] alike, we have from him a [[great]] manifestation of [[great]] [[love]], which belongs only to the [[good]]. for although we can never sufficiently give thanks to him, that we are, that we [[live]], that we behold [[heaven]] and [[earth]], that we have [[mind]] and [[reason]] by which to seek after him who made all these things, nevertheless, what hearts [[heart]], what number of tongues, shall affirm that they are sufficient to render thanks to him for this, that he hath not wholly departed from us, laden and overwhelmed with sins [[sin]], averse to the contemplation of his [[light]], and blinded by the [[love]] of darkness, that is, of [[iniquity]], but hath sent to us his own word, who is his only [[son]], that by his birth and suffering for us in the flesh, which he assumed, we might [[know]] how much [[god]] valued [[man]], and that by that unique [[sacrifice]] we might be purified from all our sins [[sin]], and that, [[love]] being shed abroad in our hearts [[heart]] by his spirit, we might, having surmounted all difficulties, come into eternal rest, and the ineffable sweetness of the contemplation of himself?

32. that at no [[time]] in the [[past]] was the mystery of christ's redemption awanting, but was at all times [[time]] declared, though in various forms.

this mystery of eternal [[life]], even from the beginning of the [[human]] [[race]], was, by [[certain]] signs and sacraments suitable to the times [[time]], announced through angels to those to whom it was meet. then the [[hebrew]] [[people]] was congregated into one [[republic]], as it were, to perform this mystery; and in that [[republic]] was foretold, sometimes through [[men]] who understood what they spake, and sometimes through [[men]] who understood not, all that had transpired since the advent of [[christ]] until now, and all that will transpire. this same nation, too, was afterwards dispersed through the nations, in order to testify to the scriptures [[scripture]] in which eternal salvation in [[christ]] had been declared. for not only the prophecies which are contained in words, nor only the precepts for the [[right]] conduct of [[life]], which teach[pg 300] morals [[moral]] and piety, and are contained in the [[sacred]] writings,—not only these, but also the rites, priesthood, tabernacle or temple, altars, sacrifices [[sacrifice]], ceremonies [[ceremony]], and whatever else belongs to that service which is due to [[god]], and which in [[greek]] is properly called λατρεία,—all these signified and fore-announced those things which we who [[believe]] in [[jesus]] [[christ]] unto eternal [[life]] [[believe]] to have been fulfilled, or behold in process of fulfilment, or confidently [[believe]] shall yet be fulfilled.

33. that only through the [[christian]] [[religion]] could the deceit of malign spirits, who rejoice in the errors of [[men]], have been manifested.

this, the only true [[religion]], has alone been able to manifest that the gods of the nations are most impure demons, who [[desire]] to be [[thought]] gods, availing themselves of the names of [[certain]] defunct souls [[soul]], or the appearance of mundane creatures, and with proud impurity rejoicing in things most base and infamous, as though in [[divine]] honours [[honour]], and envying [[human]] souls [[soul]] their conversion to the true [[god]]. from whose most cruel and most impious dominion a [[man]] is liberated when he believes [[belief]] on him who has afforded an [[example]] of [[humility]], following which [[men]] may rise as [[great]] as was that [[pride]] by which they fell. hence are not only those gods, concerning whom we have already spoken much, and many others belonging to different nations and lands [[land]], but also those of whom we are now treating, who have been selected as it were into the senate of the gods,—selected, however, on account of the notoriousness of their crimes, not on account of the [[dignity]] of their virtues [[virtue]],—whose [[sacred]] things varro attempts to refer to [[certain]] [[natural]] reasons [[reason]], seeking to make base things honourable, but cannot find how to square and agree with these reasons [[reason]], because these are not the causes of those rites, which he thinks [[think]], or rather wishes [[wish]] to be [[thought]] to be so. for had not only these, but also all others of this [[kind]], been real causes, even though they had nothing to do with the true [[god]] and eternal [[life]], which is to be sought in [[religion]], they would, by affording some sort of [[reason]] drawn from the [[nature]] of things, have mitigated in some [[degree]] that offence which was occasioned by some turpitude or absurdity in the [[sacred]] rites, which was not understood. this he attempted to do in [[respect]] to [[certain]] fables of the theatres, or mysteries of the[pg 301] shrines; but he did not acquit the theatres of likeness to the shrines, but rather condemned the shrines for likeness to the theatres. however, he in some way made the attempt to soothe the feelings shocked by horrible things, by rendering what he would have to be [[natural]] interpretations.

34. concerning the books [[book]] of numa pompilius, which the senate ordered to be burned, in order that the causes of [[sacred]] rites therein assigned should not become known..

but, on the other hand, we find, as the same most learned [[man]] has related, that the causes of the [[sacred]] rites which were given from the books [[book]] of numa pompilius could by no means be tolerated, and were considered unworthy, not only to become known to the [[religious]] by being [[read]], but even to [[lie]] written in the darkness in which they had been concealed. for now let me say what i promised in the third [[book]] of this [[work]] to say in its proper place. for, as we [[read]] in the same varro's [[book]] on the [[worship]] of the gods, "a [[certain]] one terentius had a field at the janiculum, and once, when his ploughman was passing the plough near to the tomb of numa pompilius, he turned up from the ground the books [[book]] of numa, in which were written the causes of the [[sacred]] [[institutions]]; which books [[book]] he carried to the prætor, who, having [[read]] the beginnings of them, referred to the senate what seemed to be a matter of so much importance. and when the [[chief]] senators had [[read]] [[certain]] of the causes why this or that rite was instituted, the senate assented to the [[dead]] numa, and the conscript fathers [[father]], as though concerned for the interests of [[religion]], ordered the prætor to burn the books [[book]]."[288] let each one [[believe]] what he thinks [[think]]; nay, let every champion of such impiety say whatever mad contention may suggest. for my part, let it suffice to suggest that the causes of those [[sacred]] things which were written down by [[king]] numa pompilius, the institutor of the roman rites, ought never to have become known to [[people]] or senate, or even to the priests [[priest]] themselves; and also that numa himself attained to these secrets of demons by an illicit curiosity, in order that he might write them down, so as to be able, by reading, to be reminded of them. however, though he was [[king]], and had no cause to[pg 302] be afraid of any one, he neither dared to [[teach]] them to any one, nor to [[destroy]] them by obliteration, or any other form of destruction. therefore, because he was unwilling that any one should [[know]] them, lest [[men]] should be taught infamous things, and because he was afraid to violate them, lest he should enrage the demons against himself, he buried them in what he [[thought]] a safe place, believing that a plough could not approach his sepulchre. but the senate, fearing to condemn the [[religious]] solemnities of their [[ancestors]], and therefore compelled to assent to numa, were nevertheless so convinced that those books [[book]] were pernicious, that they did not order them to be buried again, knowing that [[human]] curiosity would thereby be excited to seek with far greater eagerness after the matter already divulged, but ordered the scandalous relics to be destroyed with [[fire]]; because, as they [[thought]] it was now a necessity to perform those [[sacred]] rites, they judged that the error arising from ignorance of their causes was more tolerable than the disturbance which the [[knowledge]] of them would [[occasion]] the [[state]].

35. concerning the hydromancy through which numa was befooled by [[certain]] images of demons seen in the water.

for numa himself also, to whom no [[prophet]] of [[god]], no holy angel was sent, was driven to have recourse to hydromancy, that he might see the images of the gods in the water (or, rather, appearances whereby the demons made [[sport]] of him), and might learn from them what he ought to ordain and observe in the [[sacred]] rites. this [[kind]] of divination, says varro, was introduced from the persians, and was used by numa himself, and at an after [[time]] by the philosopher pythagoras. in this divination, he says, they also inquire at the inhabitants of the nether [[world]], and make use of [[blood]]; and this the greeks [[greek]] call νεκρομαντείαν. but whether it be called necromancy or hydromancy it is the same thing, for in either case the [[dead]] are supposed to foretell future things. but by what artifices these things are done, let themselves consider; for i am unwilling to say that these artifices were wont to be prohibited by the laws [[law]], and to be very severely punished even in the gentile states, before the advent of our saviour. i am unwilling, i say, to affirm this, for perhaps[pg 303] even such things were then allowed. however, it was by these [[arts]] that pompilius learned those [[sacred]] rites which he gave forth as facts [[fact]], whilst he concealed their causes; for even he himself was afraid of that which he had learned. the senate also caused the books [[book]] in which those causes were recorded to be burned. what is it, then, to me, that varro attempts to adduce all sorts of fanciful physical interpretations, which if these books [[book]] had contained, they would certainly not have been burned? for otherwise the conscript fathers [[father]] would also have burned those books [[book]] which varro published and dedicated to the high [[priest]] cæsar.[289] now numa is said to have [[married]] the [[nymph]] egeria, because (as varro explains it in the forementioned book) he carried forth[290] water wherewith to perform his hydromancy. thus facts [[fact]] are wont to be converted into fables through false colourings. it was by that hydromancy, then, that that over-curious roman [[king]] learned both the [[sacred]] rites which were to be written in the books [[book]] of the priests [[priest]], and also the causes of those rites,—which latter, however, he was unwilling that any one besides himself should [[know]]. wherefore he made these causes, as it were, to [[die]] along with himself, taking [[care]] to have them written by themselves, and removed from the [[knowledge]] of [[men]] by being buried in the [[earth]]. wherefore the things which are written in those books [[book]] were either abominations of demons, so foul and noxious as to render that whole civil theology execrable even in the [[eyes]] of such [[men]] as those senators, who had accepted so many shameful things in the [[sacred]] rites themselves, or they were nothing else than the accounts of [[dead]] [[men]], whom, through the lapse of ages [[age]], almost all the gentile nations had come to [[believe]] to be [[immortal]] gods; whilst those same demons were delighted even with such rites, having presented themselves to receive [[worship]] under pretence of being those very [[dead]] [[men]] whom they had caused to be [[thought]] [[immortal]] gods by [[certain]] fallacious [[miracles]], performed in order to establish that [[belief]]. but, by the hidden providence of the true [[god]], these demons were permitted to confess these things to their friend numa, having been gained by those [[arts]] through which necromancy could be performed, and yet[pg 304] were not constrained to admonish him rather at his [[death]] to burn than to bury the books [[book]] in which they were written. but, in order that these books [[book]] might be unknown, the demons could not resist the plough by which they were thrown up, or the pen of varro, through which the things which were done in reference to this matter have come down even to our [[knowledge]]. for they are not able to effect anything which they are not allowed; but they are permitted to influence those whom [[god]], in his deep and just [[judgment]], according to their deserts, gives over either to be simply afflicted by them, or to be also subdued and deceived. but how pernicious these writings were judged to be, or how alien from the [[worship]] of the true divinity, may be understood from the [[fact]] that the senate preferred to burn what pompilius had hid, rather than to [[fear]] what he feared, so that he could not dare to do that. wherefore let him who does not [[desire]] to [[live]] a pious [[life]] even now, seek eternal [[life]] by means of such rites. but let him who does not [[wish]] to have fellowship with malign demons have no [[fear]] for the noxious superstition wherewith they are worshipped, but let him recognise the true [[religion]] by which they are unmasked and vanquished.

[pg 305]

book eighth.

argument.

augustine comes now to the third [[kind]] of theology, that is, the [[natural]], and takes up the [[question]], whether the [[worship]] of the gods of the [[natural]] theology is of any avail towards securing blessedness in the [[life]] to come. this [[question]] he prefers to discuss with the platonists, because the platonic [[system]] is "facile princeps" among philosophies, and makes the nearest approximation to [[christian]] [[truth]]. in pursuing this argument, he first refutes apuleius, and all who maintain that the demons should be worshipped as messengers and mediators between gods and [[men]]; demonstrating that by no possibility can [[men]] be reconciled to [[good]] gods by demons, who are the slaves [[slave]] of [[vice]], and who delight in and patronize what [[good]] and [[wise]] [[men]] abhor and condemn,—the blasphemous fictions of poets, theatrical exhibitions, and magical [[arts]].

1. that the [[question]] of [[natural]] theology is to be discussed with those [[philosophers]] who sought a more excellent [[wisdom]].

we shall require to apply our [[mind]] with far greater intensity to the [[present]] [[question]] than was requisite in the solution and unfolding of the questions [[question]] handled in the preceding books [[book]]; for it is not with ordinary [[men]], but with [[philosophers]] that we must confer concerning the theology which they call [[natural]]. for it is not like the fabulous, that is, the theatrical; nor the civil, that is, the urban theology: the one of which displays the crimes of the gods, whilst the other manifests their [[criminal]] desires [[desire]], which demonstrate them to be rather malign demons than gods. it is, we say, with [[philosophers]] we have to confer with [[respect]] to this theology,—men whose very name, if rendered into latin, signifies those who profess the [[love]] of [[wisdom]]. now, if [[wisdom]] is [[god]], who made all things, as is attested by the [[divine]] [[authority]] and [[truth]],[291] then the philosopher is a lover of [[god]]. but since the thing itself, which is called by this name, exists not in all who [[glory]] in the name,—for it does not [[follow]], of course, that[pg 306] all who are called [[philosophers]] are lovers of true [[wisdom]],—we must needs select from the number of those with whose opinions [[opinion]] we have been able to acquaint ourselves by reading, some with whom we may not unworthily engage in the treatment of this [[question]]. for i have not in this [[work]] undertaken to refute all the [[vain]] opinions [[opinion]] of the [[philosophers]], but only such as pertain to theology, which [[greek]] word we [[understand]] to mean an account or explanation of the [[divine]] [[nature]]. nor, again, have i undertaken to refute all the [[vain]] theological opinions [[opinion]] of all the [[philosophers]], but only of such of them as, agreeing in the [[belief]] that there is a [[divine]] [[nature]], and that this [[divine]] [[nature]] is concerned about [[human]] affairs, do nevertheless deny that the [[worship]] of the one unchangeable [[god]] is sufficient for the obtaining of a blessed [[life]] after [[death]], as well as at the [[present]] [[time]]; and hold that, in order to obtain that [[life]], many gods, created, indeed, and appointed to their several spheres by that one [[god]], are to be worshipped. these approach nearer to the [[truth]] than even varro; for, whilst he saw no difficulty in extending [[natural]] theology in its entirety even to the [[world]] and the [[soul]] of the [[world]], these acknowledge [[god]] as existing above all that is of the [[nature]] of [[soul]], and as the creator not only of this visible [[world]], which is often called [[heaven]] and [[earth]], but also of every [[soul]] whatsoever, and as him who gives blessedness to the [[rational]] [[soul]],—of which [[kind]] is the [[human]] [[soul]],—by participation in his own unchangeable and incorporeal [[light]]. there is no one, who has even a slender [[knowledge]] of these things, who does not [[know]] of the platonic [[philosophers]], who derive their name from their master [[plato]]. concerning this [[plato]], then, i will briefly [[state]] such things as i deem necessary to the [[present]] [[question]], mentioning beforehand those who preceded him in [[time]] in the same department of literature.

2. concerning the two schools of [[philosophers]], that is, the italic and ionic, and their founders.

as far as concerns the literature of the greeks [[greek]], whose [[language]] holds a more illustrious place than any of the languages [[language]] of the other nations, [[history]] mentions two schools of [[philosophers]], the one called the italic school, originating in that part of [[italy]] which was formerly called magna græcia;[pg 307] the other called the ionic school, having its origin in those regions which are still called by the name of greece. the italic school had for its founder pythagoras of samos, to whom also the term "philosophy" is said to owe its origin. for whereas formerly those who seemed to excel others by the laudable manner in which they regulated their lives [[life]] were called sages, pythagoras, on being [[asked]] what he professed, replied that he was a philosopher, that is, a student or lover of [[wisdom]]; for it seemed to him to be the height of arrogance to profess oneself a sage.[292] the founder of the ionic school, again, was thales of miletus, one of those seven who were styled the "seven sages," of whom six were distinguished by the [[kind]] of [[life]] they lived, and by [[certain]] maxims [[maxim]] which they gave forth for the proper conduct of [[life]]. thales was distinguished as an investigator into the [[nature]] of things; and, in order that he might have successors in his school, he committed his dissertations to writing. that, however, which especially rendered him eminent was his ability, by means of astronomical calculations, even to predict eclipses of the sun and moon. he [[thought]], however, that water was the first [[principle]] of things, and that of it all the elements of the [[world]], the [[world]] itself, and all things which are generated in it, ultimately consist. over all this [[work]], however, which, when we consider the [[world]], appears so admirable, he set nothing of the [[nature]] of [[divine]] [[mind]]. to him succeeded anaximander, his pupil, who held a different [[opinion]] concerning the [[nature]] of things; for he did not hold that all things spring from one [[principle]], as thales did, who held that [[principle]] to be water, but [[thought]] that each thing springs from its own proper [[principle]]. these principles [[principle]] of things he believed to be infinite in number, and [[thought]] that they generated innumerable worlds [[world]], and all the things which arise in them. he [[thought]], also, that these worlds [[world]] are [[subject]] to a perpetual process of alternate dissolution and regeneration, each one continuing for a longer or shorter period of [[time]], according to the [[nature]] of the case; nor did he, any more than thales, attribute anything to a [[divine]] [[mind]] in the production of all this activity of things. anaximander left as his successor his[pg 308] disciple anaximenes, who attributed all the causes of things to an infinite air. he neither denied nor ignored the existence of gods, but, so far from believing that the air was made by them, he held, on the contrary, that they sprang from the air. anaxagoras, however, who was his pupil, perceived that a [[divine]] [[mind]] was the productive cause of all things which we see, and said that all the various kinds [[kind]] of things, according to their several modes and [[species]], were produced out of an infinite matter consisting of homogeneous particles, but by the efficiency of a [[divine]] [[mind]]. diogenes, also, another pupil of anaximenes, said that a [[certain]] air was the original substance of things out of which all things were produced, but that it was possessed of a [[divine]] [[reason]], without which nothing could be produced from it. anaxagoras was succeeded by his disciple archelaus, who also [[thought]] that all things consisted of homogeneous particles, of which each particular thing was made, but that those particles were pervaded by a [[divine]] [[mind]], which perpetually energized all the eternal bodies [[body]], namely, those particles, so that they are alternately [[united]] and separated. [[socrates]], the master of [[plato]], is said to have been the disciple of archelaus; and on plato's account it is that i have given this brief historical sketch of the whole [[history]] of these schools.

3. of the socratic [[philosophy]].

socrates is said to have been the first who directed the entire effort of [[philosophy]] to the correction and regulation of manners, all who went before him having expended their [[greatest]] efforts in the investigation of physical, that is, [[natural]] phenomena. however, it seems to me that it cannot be certainly discovered whether [[socrates]] did this because he was wearied of obscure and uncertain things, and so wished to direct his [[mind]] to the discovery of something manifest and [[certain]], which was necessary in order to the obtaining of a blessed [[life]],—that one [[great]] object toward which the [[labour]], vigilance, and industry of all [[philosophers]] seem to have been directed,—or whether (as some yet more favourable to him suppose) he did it because he was unwilling that minds [[mind]] defiled with earthly desires [[desire]] should essay to raise themselves upward to [[divine]] things. for he saw that the causes of[pg 309] things were sought for by them,—which causes he believed to be ultimately reducible to nothing else than the will of the one true and supreme [[god]],—and on this account he [[thought]] they could only be comprehended by a purified [[mind]]; and therefore that all diligence ought to be given to the purification of the [[life]] by [[good]] morals [[moral]], in order that the [[mind]], delivered from the depressing weight of lusts, might raise itself upward by its native vigour to eternal things, and might, with purified understanding, contemplate that [[nature]] which is incorporeal and unchangeable [[light]], where [[live]] the causes of all created natures [[nature]]. it is evident, however, that he hunted out and pursued, with a wonderful pleasantness of style and argument, and with a most pointed and insinuating urbanity, the foolishness of ignorant [[men]], who [[thought]] that they knew this or that,—sometimes confessing his own ignorance, and sometimes dissimulating his [[knowledge]], even in those very [[moral]] questions [[question]] to which he seems to have directed the whole [[force]] of his [[mind]]. and hence there arose hostility against him, which ended in his being calumniously impeached, and condemned to [[death]]. afterwards, however, that very [[city]] of the athenians, which had publicly condemned him, did publicly bewail him,—the popular indignation having turned with such vehemence on his accusers, that one of them perished by the [[violence]] of the multitude, whilst the other only escaped a like [[punishment]] by voluntary and perpetual [[exile]].

illustrious, therefore, both in his [[life]] and in his [[death]], [[socrates]] left very many disciples of his [[philosophy]], who vied with one another in [[desire]] for proficiency in handling those [[moral]] questions [[question]] which concern the [[chief]] [[good]] (summum bonum), the possession of which can make a [[man]] blessed; and because, in the disputations of [[socrates]], where he raises all manner of questions [[question]], makes assertions, and then demolishes them, it did not evidently appear what he held to be the [[chief]] [[good]], every one took from these disputations what pleased him [[best]], and every one placed the final good[293] in whatever it appeared to himself to consist. now, that which is called the final [[good]] is that at which,[pg 310] when one has arrived, he is blessed. but so diverse were the opinions [[opinion]] held by those followers of [[socrates]] concerning this final [[good]], that (a thing scarcely to be credited with [[respect]] to the followers of one master) some placed the [[chief]] [[good]] in [[pleasure]], as aristippus, others in [[virtue]], as antisthenes. indeed, it were tedious to recount the various opinions [[opinion]] of various disciples.

4. concerning [[plato]], the [[chief]] among the disciples of [[socrates]], and his threefold division of [[philosophy]].

but, among the disciples of [[socrates]], [[plato]] was the one who shone with a [[glory]] which far excelled that of the others, and who not unjustly eclipsed them all. by birth an athenian of honourable parentage, he far surpassed his fellow-disciples in [[natural]] endowments, of which he was possessed in a wonderful [[degree]]. yet, deeming himself and the socratic discipline far from sufficient for bringing [[philosophy]] to [[perfection]], he travelled as extensively as he was able, going to every place famed for the cultivation of any [[science]] of which he could make himself master. thus he learned from the [[egyptians]] whatever they held and taught as important; and from [[egypt]], passing into those parts of [[italy]] which were filled with the fame of the pythagoreans, he mastered, with the [[greatest]] facility, and under the most eminent teachers, all the italic [[philosophy]] which was then in vogue. and, as he had a peculiar [[love]] for his master [[socrates]], he made him the speaker in all his dialogues, putting into his mouth whatever he had learned, either from others, or from the efforts of his own powerful [[intellect]], tempering even his [[moral]] disputations with the grace and politeness of the socratic style. and, as the study of [[wisdom]] consists in action and contemplation, so that one part of it may be called active, and the other contemplative,—the active part having reference to the conduct of [[life]], that is, to the regulation of morals [[moral]], and the contemplative part to the investigation into the causes of [[nature]] and into pure [[truth]],—socrates is said to have excelled in the active part of that study, while pythagoras gave more attention to its contemplative part, on which he brought to bear all the [[force]] of his [[great]] [[intellect]]. to [[plato]] is given the [[praise]] of having perfected [[philosophy]] by combining both parts into one. he[pg 311] then divides it into three parts,—the first [[moral]], which is chiefly occupied with action; the second [[natural]], of which the object is contemplation; and the third [[rational]], which discriminates between the true and the false. and though this [[last]] is necessary both to action and contemplation, it is contemplation, nevertheless, which lays peculiar claim to the office of investigating the [[nature]] of [[truth]]. thus this tripartite division is not contrary to that which made the study of [[wisdom]] to consist in action and contemplation. now, as to what [[plato]] [[thought]] with [[respect]] to each of these parts,—that is, what he believed to be the end of all actions, the cause of all natures [[nature]], and the [[light]] of all intelligences,—it would be a [[question]] too long to discuss, and about which we ought not to make any rash affirmation. for, as [[plato]] liked and constantly affected the well-known method of his master [[socrates]], namely, that of dissimulating his [[knowledge]] or his opinions [[opinion]], it is not easy to discover clearly what he himself [[thought]] on various matters, any more than it is to discover what were the real opinions [[opinion]] of [[socrates]]. we must, nevertheless, insert into our [[work]] [[certain]] of those opinions [[opinion]] which he expresses in his writings, whether he himself uttered them, or narrates them as expressed by others, and seems himself to approve of,—opinions sometimes favourable to the true [[religion]], which our [[faith]] takes up and defends, and sometimes contrary to it, as, for [[example]], in the questions [[question]] concerning the existence of one [[god]] or of many, as it relates to the truly blessed [[life]] which is to be after [[death]]. for those who are praised as having most closely followed [[plato]], who is justly preferred to all the other [[philosophers]] of the gentiles, and who are said to have manifested the [[greatest]] acuteness in understanding him, do perhaps entertain such an [[idea]] of [[god]] as to admit that in him are to be found the cause of existence, the ultimate [[reason]] for the understanding, and the end in reference to which the whole [[life]] is to be regulated. of which three things, the first is understood to pertain to the [[natural]], the second to the [[rational]], and the third to the [[moral]] part of [[philosophy]]. for if [[man]] has been so created as to attain, through that which is most excellent in him, to that which excels all things,—that is, to the one true and absolutely good[pg 312] [[god]], without whom no [[nature]] exists, no doctrine instructs, no exercise profits [[profit]],—let him be sought in whom all things are secure to us, let him be discovered in whom all [[truth]] becomes [[certain]] to us, let him be loved in whom all becomes [[right]] to us.

5. that it is especially with the platonists that we must carry on our disputations on matters of theology, their opinions [[opinion]] being preferable to those of all other [[philosophers]].

if, then, [[plato]] defined the [[wise]] [[man]] as one who imitates, knows [[know]], loves [[love]] this [[god]], and who is rendered blessed through fellowship with him in his own blessedness, why discuss with the other [[philosophers]]? it is evident that none come nearer to us than the platonists. to them, therefore, let that fabulous theology give place which delights the minds [[mind]] of [[men]] with the crimes of the gods; and that civil theology also, in which impure demons, under the name of gods, have seduced the peoples [[people]] of the [[earth]] given up to earthly pleasures [[pleasure]], desiring to be honoured by the errors of [[men]], and, by filling the minds [[mind]] of their worshippers with impure desires [[desire]], exciting them to make the representation of their crimes one of the rites of their [[worship]], whilst they themselves found in the spectators of these exhibitions a most pleasing spectacle,—a theology in which, whatever was honourable in the temple, was defiled by its mixture with the obscenity of the theatre, and whatever was base in the theatre was vindicated by the abominations of the temples. to these [[philosophers]] also the interpretations of varro must give place, in which he explains the [[sacred]] rites as having reference to [[heaven]] and [[earth]], and to the seeds and operations of perishable things; for, in the first place, those rites have not the signification which he would have [[men]] [[believe]] is attached to them, and therefore [[truth]] does not [[follow]] him in his attempt so to interpret them; and even if they had this signification, still those things ought not to be worshipped by the [[rational]] [[soul]] as its [[god]] which are placed below it in the scale of [[nature]], nor ought the [[soul]] to prefer to itself as gods things to which the true [[god]] has given it the preference. the same must be said of those writings pertaining to the [[sacred]] rites, which numa pompilius took [[care]] to conceal by causing them to be buried along with himself, and which,[pg 313] when they were afterwards turned up by the plough, were burned by order of the senate. and, to treat numa with all [[honour]], let us mention as belonging to the same rank as these writings that which alexander of macedon wrote to his [[mother]] as communicated to him by leo, an egyptian high [[priest]]. in this letter not only picus and faunus, and æneas and romulus, or even hercules and æsculapius and liber, born of semele, and the twin sons [[son]] of tyndareus, or any other mortals who have been deified, but even the principal gods themselves,[294] to whom cicero, in his tusculan questions [[question]],[295] alludes without mentioning their names, [[jupiter]], juno, saturn, vulcan, vesta, and many others whom varro attempts to identify with the parts or the elements of the [[world]], are shown to have been [[men]]. there is, as we have said, a similarity between this case and that of numa; for, the [[priest]] being afraid because he had revealed a mystery, earnestly begged of alexander to command his [[mother]] to burn the letter which conveyed these communications to her. let these two theologies, then, the fabulous and the civil, give place to the platonic [[philosophers]], who have recognised the true [[god]] as the author of all things, the source of the [[light]] of [[truth]], and the bountiful bestower of all blessedness. and not these only, but to these [[great]] acknowledgers of so [[great]] a [[god]], those [[philosophers]] must yield who, having their [[mind]] enslaved to their [[body]], supposed the principles [[principle]] of all things to be material; as thales, who held that the first [[principle]] of all things was water; anaximenes, that it was air; the stoics, that it was [[fire]]; epicurus, who affirmed that it consisted of atoms, that is to say, of minute corpuscules; and many others whom it is needless to enumerate, but who believed that bodies [[body]], simple or compound, animate or inanimate, but nevertheless bodies [[body]], were the cause and [[principle]] of all things. for some of them—as, for instance, the epicureans—believed that living things could originate from things without [[life]]; others held that all things living or without [[life]] spring from a living [[principle]], but that, nevertheless, all things, being material, spring from a material [[principle]]. for the stoics [[thought]] that [[fire]], that is, one of the four material elements of which this visible[pg 314] [[world]] is composed, was both living and [[intelligent]], the maker of the [[world]] and of all things contained in it,—that it was in [[fact]] [[god]]. these and others like them have only been able to suppose that which their hearts [[heart]] enslaved to sense have vainly suggested to them. and yet they have within themselves something which they could not see: they represented to themselves inwardly things which they had seen without, even when they were not seeing them, but only thinking of them. but this representation in [[thought]] is no longer a [[body]], but only the similitude of a [[body]]; and that faculty of the [[mind]] by which this similitude of a [[body]] is seen is neither a [[body]] nor the similitude of a [[body]]; and the faculty which judges [[judge]] whether the representation is beautiful or ugly is without [[doubt]] superior to the object judged of. this [[principle]] is the understanding of [[man]], the [[rational]] [[soul]]; and it is certainly not a [[body]], since that similitude of a [[body]] which it beholds and judges [[judge]] of is itself not a [[body]]. the [[soul]] is neither [[earth]], nor water, nor air, nor [[fire]], of which four bodies [[body]], called the four elements, we see that this [[world]] is composed. and if the [[soul]] is not a [[body]], how should [[god]], its creator, be a [[body]]? let all those [[philosophers]], then, give place, as we have said, to the platonists, and those also who have been ashamed to say that [[god]] is a [[body]], but yet have [[thought]] that our souls [[soul]] are of the same [[nature]] as [[god]]. they have not been staggered by the [[great]] changeableness of the [[soul]],—an attribute which it would be impious to ascribe to the [[divine]] [[nature]],—but they say it is the [[body]] which changes [[change]] the [[soul]], for in itself it is unchangeable. as well might they say, "flesh is wounded by some [[body]], for in itself it is invulnerable." in a word, that which is unchangeable can be changed by nothing, so that that which can be changed by the [[body]] cannot properly be said to be immutable.

6. concerning the meaning of the platonists in that part of [[philosophy]] called physical.

these [[philosophers]], then, whom we see not undeservedly exalted above the rest in fame and [[glory]], have seen that no material [[body]] is [[god]], and therefore they have transcended all bodies [[body]] in seeking for [[god]]. they have seen that whatever is changeable is not the most high [[god]], and therefore they[pg 315] have transcended every [[soul]] and all changeable spirits in seeking the supreme. they have seen also that, in every changeable thing, the form which makes it that which it is, whatever be its mode or [[nature]], can only be through him who truly is, because he is unchangeable. and therefore, whether we consider the whole [[body]] of the [[world]], its figure, qualities, and orderly movement, and also all the bodies [[body]] which are in it; or whether we consider all [[life]], either that which nourishes and maintains, as the [[life]] of trees, or that which, besides this, has also sensation, as the [[life]] of beasts; or that which adds to all these [[intelligence]], as the [[life]] of [[man]]; or that which does not need the support of nutriment, but only maintains, feels [[feel]], understands, as the [[life]] of angels,—all can only be through him who absolutely is. for to him it is not one thing to be, and another to [[live]], as though he could be, not living; nor is it to him one thing to [[live]], and another thing to [[understand]], as though he could [[live]], not understanding; nor is it to him one thing to [[understand]], another thing to be blessed, as though he could [[understand]] and not be blessed. but to him to [[live]], to [[understand]], to be blessed, are to be. they have understood, from this unchangeableness and this simplicity, that all things must have been made by him, and that he could himself have been made by none. for they have considered that whatever is is either [[body]] or [[life]], and that [[life]] is something [[better]] than [[body]], and that the [[nature]] of [[body]] is sensible, and that of [[life]] intelligible. therefore they have preferred the intelligible [[nature]] to the sensible. we mean by sensible things such things as can be perceived by the sight and touch of the [[body]]; by intelligible things, such as can be understood by the sight of the [[mind]]. for there is no corporeal [[beauty]], whether in the condition of a [[body]], as figure, or in its movement, as in [[music]], of which it is not the [[mind]] that judges [[judge]]. but this could never have been, had there not existed in the [[mind]] itself a superior form of these things, without bulk, without noise of voice, without space and [[time]]. but even in [[respect]] of these things, had the [[mind]] not been mutable, it would not have been possible for one to [[judge]] [[better]] than another with regard to sensible forms. he who is clever judges [[judge]] better[pg 316] than he who is slow, he who is skilled than he who is unskilful, he who is practised than he who is unpractised; and the same [[person]] judges [[judge]] [[better]] after he has gained [[experience]] than he did before. but that which is capable of more and less is mutable; whence able [[men]], who have [[thought]] deeply on these things, have gathered that the first form is not to be found in those things whose form is changeable. since, therefore, they saw that [[body]] and [[mind]] might be more or less beautiful in form, and that, if they wanted form, they could have no existence, they saw that there is some existence in which is the first form, unchangeable, and therefore not admitting of degrees [[degree]] of comparison, and in that they most rightly believed was the first [[principle]] of things, which was not made, and by which all things were made. therefore that which is known of [[god]] he manifested to them when his invisible things were seen by them, being understood by those things which have been made; also his eternal [[power]] and godhead by whom all visible and temporal things have been created.[296] we have said enough upon that part of theology which they call physical, that is, [[natural]].

7. how much the platonists are to be held as excelling other [[philosophers]] in [[logic]], i.e. [[rational]] [[philosophy]].

then, again, as far as regards the doctrine which treats of that which they call [[logic]], that is, [[rational]] [[philosophy]], far be it from us to compare them with those who attributed to the bodily senses the faculty of discriminating [[truth]], and [[thought]] that all we learn is to be measured by their untrustworthy and fallacious rules [[rule]]. such were the epicureans, and all of the same school. such also were the stoics, who ascribed to the bodily senses that expertness in disputation which they so ardently [[love]], called by them dialectic, asserting that from the senses the [[mind]] conceives the notions (ἔννοιαι) of those things which they explicate by definition. and hence is developed the whole plan and connection of their learning and teaching. i often wonder, with [[respect]] to this, how they can say that none are beautiful but the [[wise]]; for by what bodily sense have they perceived that [[beauty]], by what [[eyes]] of the flesh have they seen wisdom's comeliness[pg 317] of form? those, however, whom we justly rank before all others, have distinguished those things which are conceived by the [[mind]] from those which are perceived by the senses, neither taking away from the senses anything to which they are competent, nor attributing to them anything beyond their competency. and the [[light]] of our understandings, by which all things are learned by us, they have affirmed to be that selfsame [[god]] by whom all things were made.

8. that the platonists hold the first rank in [[moral]] [[philosophy]] also.

the remaining part of [[philosophy]] is morals [[moral]], or what is called by the greeks [[greek]] ἠθική, in which is discussed the [[question]] concerning the [[chief]] [[good]],—that which will leave us nothing further to seek in order to be blessed, if only we make all our actions refer to it, and seek it not for the sake of something else, but for its own sake. therefore it is called the end, because we [[wish]] other things on account of it, but itself only for its own sake. this beatific [[good]], therefore, according to some, comes to a [[man]] from the [[body]], according to others, from the [[mind]], and, according to others, from both together. for they saw that [[man]] himself consists of [[soul]] and [[body]]; and therefore they believed that from either of these two, or from both together, their well-being must proceed, consisting in a [[certain]] final [[good]], which could render them blessed, and to which they might refer all their actions, not requiring anything ulterior to which to refer that [[good]] itself. this is why those who have added a third [[kind]] of [[good]] things, which they call extrinsic,—as [[honour]], [[glory]], [[wealth]], and the like,—have not regarded them as part of the final [[good]], that is, to be sought after for their own sake, but as things which are to be sought for the sake of something else, affirming that this [[kind]] of [[good]] is [[good]] to the [[good]], and [[evil]] to the [[evil]]. wherefore, whether they have sought the [[good]] of [[man]] from the [[mind]] or from the [[body]], or from both together, it is still only from [[man]] they have supposed that it must be sought. but they who have sought it from the [[body]] have sought it from the inferior part of [[man]]; they who have sought it from the [[mind]], from the superior part; and they who have sought it from both, from the whole [[man]]. whether, therefore, they[pg 318] have sought it from any part, or from the whole [[man]], still they have only sought it from [[man]]; nor have these differences, being three, given rise only to three dissentient sects of [[philosophers]], but to many. for diverse [[philosophers]] have held diverse opinions [[opinion]], both concerning the [[good]] of the [[body]], and the [[good]] of the [[mind]], and the [[good]] of both together. let, therefore, all these give place to those [[philosophers]] who have not affirmed that a [[man]] is blessed by the enjoyment of the [[body]], or by the enjoyment of the [[mind]], but by the enjoyment of [[god]],—enjoying him, however, not as the [[mind]] does the [[body]] or itself, or as one friend enjoys another, but as the eye enjoys [[light]], if, indeed, we may draw any comparison between these things. but what the [[nature]] of this comparison is, will, if [[god]] [[help]] me, be shown in another place, to the [[best]] of my ability. at [[present]], it is sufficient to mention that [[plato]] determined the final [[good]] to be to [[live]] according to [[virtue]], and affirmed that he only can attain to [[virtue]] who knows [[know]] and imitates [[god]],—which [[knowledge]] and imitation are the only cause of blessedness. therefore he did not [[doubt]] that to philosophize is to [[love]] [[god]], whose [[nature]] is incorporeal. whence it certainly follows that the student of [[wisdom]], that is, the philosopher, will then become blessed when he shall have begun to enjoy [[god]]. for though he is not necessarily blessed who enjoys that which he loves [[love]] (for many are miserable by loving that which ought not to be loved, and still more miserable when they enjoy it), nevertheless no one is blessed who does not enjoy that which he loves [[love]]. for even they who [[love]] things which ought not to be loved do not count themselves blessed by loving merely, but by enjoying them. who, then, but the most miserable will deny that he is blessed, who enjoys that which he loves [[love]], and loves [[love]] the true and highest [[good]]? but the true and highest [[good]], according to [[plato]], is [[god]], and therefore he would call him a philosopher who loves [[love]] [[god]]; for [[philosophy]] is directed to the obtaining of the blessed [[life]], and he who loves [[love]] [[god]] is blessed in the enjoyment of [[god]].

9. concerning that [[philosophy]] which has come nearest to the [[christian]] [[faith]].

whatever [[philosophers]], therefore, [[thought]] concerning the supreme [[god]], that he is both the maker of all created things,[pg 319] the [[light]] by which things are known, and the [[good]] in reference to which things are to be done; that we have in him the first [[principle]] of [[nature]], the [[truth]] of doctrine, and the [[happiness]] of [[life]],—whether these [[philosophers]] may be more suitably called platonists, or whether they may give some other name to their sect; whether, we say, that only the [[chief]] [[men]] of the ionic school, such as [[plato]] himself, and they who have well understood him, have [[thought]] thus; or whether we also include the italic school, on account of pythagoras and the pythagoreans, and all who may have held like opinions [[opinion]]; and, lastly, whether also we include all who have been held [[wise]] [[men]] and [[philosophers]] among all nations who are discovered to have seen and taught this, be they atlantics, libyans, [[egyptians]], indians [[indian]], persians, chaldeans, scythians, gauls, spaniards, or of other nations,—we prefer these to all other [[philosophers]], and confess that they approach nearest to us.

10. that the excellency of the [[christian]] [[religion]] is above all the [[science]] of [[philosophers]].

for although a [[christian]] [[man]] instructed only in ecclesiastical literature may perhaps be ignorant of the very name of platonists, and may not even [[know]] that there have existed two schools of [[philosophers]] speaking the [[greek]] tongue, to wit, the ionic and italic, he is nevertheless not so deaf with [[respect]] to [[human]] affairs, as not to [[know]] that [[philosophers]] profess the study, and even the possession, of [[wisdom]]. he is on his guard, however, with [[respect]] to those who philosophize according to the elements of this [[world]], not according to [[god]], by whom the [[world]] itself was made; for he is warned by the precept of the apostle, and faithfully hears what has been said, "beware that no one [[deceive]] you through [[philosophy]] and [[vain]] deceit, according to the elements of the [[world]]."[297] then, that he may not suppose that all [[philosophers]] are such as do this, he hears the same apostle say concerning [[certain]] of them, "because that which is known of [[god]] is manifest among them, for [[god]] has manifested it to them. for his invisible things from the creation of the [[world]] are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made, also[pg 320] his eternal [[power]] and godhead."[298] and, when speaking to the athenians, after having spoken a mighty thing concerning [[god]], which few are able to [[understand]], "in him we [[live]], and move, and have our being,"[299] he goes on to say, "as [[certain]] also of your own have said." he knows [[know]] well, too, to be on his guard against even these [[philosophers]] in their errors. for where it has been said by him, "that [[god]] has manifested to them by those things which are made his invisible things, that they might be seen by the understanding," there it has also been said that they did not rightly [[worship]] [[god]] himself, because they paid [[divine]] honours [[honour]], which are due to him alone, to other things also to which they ought not to have paid them,—"because, knowing [[god]], they glorified him not as [[god]]; neither were thankful, but became [[vain]] in their imaginations [[imagination]], and their foolish [[heart]] was darkened. professing themselves to be [[wise]], they became fools [[fool]], and changed the [[glory]] of the incorruptible [[god]] into the likeness of the image of corruptible [[man]], and of birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things;"[300]—where the apostle would have us [[understand]] him as meaning the romans, and greeks [[greek]], and [[egyptians]], who gloried in the name of [[wisdom]]; but concerning this we will dispute with them afterwards. with [[respect]], however, to that wherein they agree with us we prefer them to all others, namely, concerning the one [[god]], the author of this [[universe]], who is not only above every [[body]], being incorporeal, but also above all souls [[soul]], being incorruptible—our [[principle]], our [[light]], our [[good]]. and though the [[christian]] [[man]], being ignorant of their writings, does not use in disputation words which he has not learned,—not calling that part of [[philosophy]] [[natural]] (which is the latin term), or physical (which is the [[greek]] one), which treats of the investigation of [[nature]]; or that part [[rational]], or logical, which deals with the [[question]] how [[truth]] may be discovered; or that part [[moral]], or ethical, which concerns morals [[moral]], and shows how [[good]] is to be sought, and [[evil]] to be shunned,—he is not, therefore, ignorant that it is from the one true and supremely [[good]] [[god]] that we have that [[nature]] in which we are made in the image of [[god]], and that doctrine by which we [[know]] him and ourselves,[pg 321] and that grace through which, by cleaving to him, we are blessed. this, therefore, is the cause why we prefer these to all the others, because, whilst other [[philosophers]] have worn out their minds [[mind]] and powers [[power]] in seeking the causes of things, and endeavouring to discover the [[right]] mode of learning and of living, these, by knowing [[god]], have found where resides the cause by which the [[universe]] has been constituted, and the [[light]] by which [[truth]] is to be discovered, and the fountain at which felicity is to be drunk. all [[philosophers]], then, who have had these thoughts [[thought]] concerning [[god]], whether platonists or others, agree with us. but we have [[thought]] it [[better]] to plead our cause with the platonists, because their writings are [[better]] known. for the greeks [[greek]], whose tongue holds the highest place among the languages [[language]] of the gentiles, are loud in their praises [[praise]] of these writings; and the latins, taken with their excellence, or their renown, have [[studied]] them more heartily than other writings, and, by translating them into our tongue, have given them greater celebrity and notoriety.

11. how [[plato]] has been able to approach so nearly to [[christian]] [[knowledge]].

certain partakers with us in the grace of [[christ]], wonder when they hear and [[read]] that [[plato]] had conceptions concerning [[god]], in which they recognise considerable agreement with the [[truth]] of our [[religion]]. some have concluded from this, that when he went to [[egypt]] he had heard the [[prophet]] jeremiah, or, whilst travelling in the same [[country]], had [[read]] the prophetic scriptures [[scripture]], which [[opinion]] i myself have expressed in [[certain]] of my writings.[301] but a careful calculation of dates, contained in chronological [[history]], shows that [[plato]] was born about a hundred years after the [[time]] in which jeremiah prophesied, and, as he lived eighty-one years, there are found to have been about seventy years from his [[death]] to that [[time]] when ptolemy, [[king]] of [[egypt]], requested the prophetic scriptures [[scripture]] of the [[hebrew]] [[people]] to be sent to him from judea, and committed them to seventy hebrews, who also knew the [[greek]] tongue, to be translated and kept. therefore, on that [[voyage]] of his, [[plato]] could neither have seen jeremiah, who was [[dead]] so long before, nor have [[read]] those same scriptures[pg 322] which had not yet been translated into the [[greek]] [[language]], of which he was a master, unless, indeed, we say that, as he was most earnest in the pursuit of [[knowledge]], he also [[studied]] those writings through an interpreter, as he did those of the [[egyptians]],—not, indeed, writing a translation of them (the facilities for doing which were only gained even by ptolemy in return for munificent acts of [[kindness]],[302] though [[fear]] of his kingly [[authority]] might have seemed a sufficient motive), but learning as much as he possibly could concerning their contents by means of conversation. what warrants this supposition is the opening verses of genesis: "in the beginning [[god]] made the [[heaven]] and [[earth]]. and the [[earth]] was invisible, and without order; and darkness was over the abyss: and the spirit of [[god]] moved over the waters."[303] for in the timæus, when writing on the formation of the [[world]], he says that [[god]] first [[united]] [[earth]] and [[fire]]; from which it is evident that he assigns to [[fire]] a place in [[heaven]]. this [[opinion]] bears a [[certain]] resemblance to the statement, "in the beginning [[god]] made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]." [[plato]] next speaks of those two intermediary elements, water and air, by which the other two extremes, namely, [[earth]] and [[fire]], were mutually [[united]]; from which circumstance he is [[thought]] to have so understood the words, "the spirit of [[god]] moved over the waters." for, not paying sufficient attention to the designations given by those scriptures [[scripture]] to the spirit of [[god]], he may have [[thought]] that the four elements are spoken of in that place, because the air also is called spirit.[304] then, as to plato's saying that the philosopher is a lover of [[god]], nothing shines forth more conspicuously in those [[sacred]] writings. but the most striking thing in this connection, and that which most of all inclines me almost to assent to the [[opinion]] that [[plato]] was not ignorant of those writings, is the [[answer]] which was given to the [[question]] elicited from the holy [[moses]] when the words of [[god]] were conveyed to him by the angel; for, when he [[asked]] what was the name of that [[god]] who was commanding him to go and deliver the [[hebrew]] [[people]] out of [[egypt]], this [[answer]] was[pg 323] given: "i am who am; and thou shalt say to the [[children]] of [[israel]], he who is sent me unto you;"[305] as though compared with him that truly is, because he is unchangeable, those things which have been created mutable are not,—a [[truth]] which [[plato]] vehemently held, and most diligently commended. and i [[know]] not whether this sentiment is anywhere to be found in the books [[book]] of those who were before [[plato]], unless in that [[book]] where it is said, "i am who am; and thou shalt say to the [[children]] of [[israel]], who is sent me unto you."

12. that even the platonists, though they say these things concerning the one true [[god]], nevertheless [[thought]] that [[sacred]] rites were to be performed in [[honour]] of many gods.

but we need not determine from what source he learned these things,—whether it was from the books [[book]] of the ancients who preceded him, or, as is more likely, from the words of the apostle: "because that which is known of [[god]] has been manifested among them, for [[god]] hath manifested it to them. for his invisible things from the creation of the [[world]] are clearly seen, being understood by those things which have been made, also his eternal [[power]] and godhead."[306] from whatever source he may have derived this [[knowledge]], then, i [[think]] i have made it sufficiently plain that i have not chosen the platonic [[philosophers]] undeservedly as the parties with whom to discuss; because the [[question]] we have just taken up concerns the [[natural]] theology,—the [[question]], namely, whether [[sacred]] rites are to be performed to one [[god]], or to many, for the sake of the [[happiness]] which is to be after [[death]]. i have specially chosen them because their juster thoughts [[thought]] concerning the one [[god]] who made [[heaven]] and [[earth]], have made them illustrious among [[philosophers]]. this has given them such superiority to all others in the [[judgment]] of [[posterity]], that, though [[aristotle]], the disciple of [[plato]], a [[man]] of eminent abilities, inferior in eloquence to [[plato]], yet far superior to many in that [[respect]], had founded the peripatetic sect,—so called because they were in the habit of walking about during their disputations,—and though he had, through the greatness of his fame, gathered very many disciples into his school, even during the [[life]] of his master; and though [[plato]] at his death[pg 324] was succeeded in his school, which was called the academy, by speusippus, his sister's [[son]], and xenocrates, his beloved disciple, who, together with their successors, were called from this name of the school, academics; nevertheless the most illustrious recent [[philosophers]], who have chosen to [[follow]] [[plato]], have been unwilling to be called peripatetics, or academics, but have preferred the name of platonists. among these were the renowned plotinus, iamblichus, and porphyry, who were greeks [[greek]], and the african apuleius, who was learned both in the [[greek]] and latin tongues. all these, however, and the rest who were of the same school, and also [[plato]] himself, [[thought]] that [[sacred]] rites ought to be performed in [[honour]] of many gods.

13. concerning the [[opinion]] of [[plato]], according to which he defined the gods as beings entirely [[good]] and the [[friends]] of [[virtue]].

therefore, although in many other important respects [[respect]] they differ from us, nevertheless with [[respect]] to this particular point of difference, which i have just stated, as it is one of [[great]] moment, and the [[question]] on hand concerns it, i will first ask them to what gods they [[think]] that [[sacred]] rites are to be performed,—to the [[good]] or to the [[bad]], or to both the [[good]] and the [[bad]]? but we have the [[opinion]] of [[plato]] affirming that all the gods are [[good]], and that there is not one of the gods [[bad]]. it follows, therefore, that these are to be performed to the [[good]], for then they are performed to gods; for if they are not [[good]], neither are they gods. now, if this be the case (for what else ought we to [[believe]] concerning the gods?), certainly it explodes the [[opinion]] that the [[bad]] gods are to be propitiated by [[sacred]] rites in order that they may not harm us, but the [[good]] gods are to be invoked in order that they may assist us. for there are no [[bad]] gods, and it is to the [[good]] that, as they say, the due [[honour]] of such rites is to be paid. of what [[character]], then, are those gods who [[love]] scenic displays, even demanding that a place be given them among [[divine]] things, and that they be exhibited in their [[honour]]? the [[power]] of these gods proves that they [[exist]], but their liking such things proves that they are [[bad]]. for it is well known what plato's [[opinion]] was concerning scenic plays. he thinks [[think]] that the poets themselves, because they[pg 325] have composed songs [[song]] so unworthy of the majesty and goodness of the gods, ought to be [[banished]] from the [[state]]. of what [[character]], therefore, are those gods who contend with [[plato]] himself about those scenic plays? he does not suffer the gods to be defamed by false crimes; the gods command those same crimes to be celebrated in their own [[honour]].

in fine, when they ordered these plays to be inaugurated, they not only demanded base things, but also did cruel things, taking from titus latinius his [[son]], and sending a disease upon him because he had refused to obey them, which they removed when he had fulfilled their commands. [[plato]], however, [[bad]] though they were, did not [[think]] they were to be feared; but, holding to his [[opinion]] with the utmost firmness and constancy, does not hesitate to remove from a well-ordered [[state]] all the sacrilegious follies of the poets, with which these gods are delighted because they themselves are impure. but labeo places this same [[plato]] (as i have mentioned already in the second book[307]) among the demi-gods. now labeo thinks [[think]] that the [[bad]] deities are to be propitiated with bloody victims, and by fasts accompanied with the same, but the [[good]] deities with plays, and all other things which are associated with joyfulness. how comes it, then, that the demi-god [[plato]] so persistently dares to take away those pleasures [[pleasure]], because he deems them base, not from the demi-gods but from the gods, and these the [[good]] gods? and, moreover, those very gods themselves do certainly refute the [[opinion]] of labeo, for they showed themselves in the case of latinius to be not only wanton and sportive, but also cruel and terrible. let the platonists, therefore, explain these things to us, since, following the [[opinion]] of their master, they [[think]] that all the gods are [[good]] and honourable, and friendly to the virtues [[virtue]] of the [[wise]], holding it unlawful to [[think]] otherwise concerning any of the gods. we will explain it, say they. let us then attentively listen to them.

14. of the [[opinion]] of those who have said that [[rational]] souls [[soul]] are of three kinds [[kind]], to wit, those of the celestial gods, those of the aerial demons, and those of terrestrial [[men]].

there is, say they, a threefold division of all animals endowed[pg 326] with a [[rational]] [[soul]], namely, into gods, [[men]], and demons. the gods occupy the loftiest region, [[men]] the lowest, the demons the middle region. for the abode of the gods is [[heaven]], that of [[men]] the [[earth]], that of the demons the air. as the [[dignity]] of their regions is diverse, so also is that of their natures [[nature]]; therefore the gods are [[better]] than [[men]] and demons. [[men]] have been placed below the gods and demons, both in [[respect]] of the order of the regions they inhabit, and the difference of their merits [[merit]]. the demons, therefore, who hold the middle place, as they are inferior to the gods, than whom they inhabit a lower region, so they are superior to [[men]], than whom they inhabit a loftier one. for they have immortality of [[body]] in [[common]] with the gods, but [[passions]] of the [[mind]] in [[common]] with [[men]]. on which account, say they, it is not wonderful that they are delighted with the obscenities of the theatre, and the fictions of the poets, since they are also [[subject]] to [[human]] [[passions]], from which the gods are far removed, and to which they are altogether strangers. whence we conclude that it was not the gods, who are all [[good]] and highly exalted, that [[plato]] deprived of the [[pleasure]] of theatric plays, by reprobating and prohibiting the fictions of the poets, but the demons.

of these things many have written: among others apuleius, the platonist of madaura, who composed a whole [[work]] on the [[subject]], entitled, concerning the [[god]] of [[socrates]]. he there discusses and explains of what [[kind]] that deity was who attended on [[socrates]], a sort of familiar, by whom it is said he was admonished to desist from any action which would not turn out to his advantage. he asserts most distinctly, and proves at [[great]] length, that it was not a [[god]] but a demon; and he discusses with [[great]] diligence the [[opinion]] of [[plato]] concerning the lofty estate of the gods, the lowly estate of [[men]], and the middle estate of demons. these things being so, how did [[plato]] dare to take away, if not from the gods, whom he removed from all [[human]] contagion, certainly from the demons, all the pleasures [[pleasure]] of the theatre, by expelling the poets from the [[state]]? evidently in this way he wished to admonish the [[human]] [[soul]], although still confined in these moribund members, to despise the shameful commands of the demons,[pg 327] and to detest their impurity, and to choose rather the splendour of [[virtue]]. but if [[plato]] showed himself [[virtuous]] in answering and prohibiting these things, then certainly it was shameful of the demons to command them. therefore either apuleius is [[wrong]], and socrates' familiar did not belong to this class of deities, or [[plato]] held contradictory opinions [[opinion]], now honouring the demons, now removing from the well-regulated [[state]] the things in which they delighted, or [[socrates]] is not to be congratulated on the [[friendship]] of the demon, of which apuleius was so ashamed that he entitled his [[book]] on the [[god]] of [[socrates]], whilst according to the tenor of his discussion, wherein he so diligently and at such length distinguishes gods from demons, he ought not to have entitled it, concerning the [[god]], but concerning the demon of [[socrates]]. but he preferred to put this into the discussion itself rather than into the title of his [[book]]. for, through the sound doctrine which has illuminated [[human]] [[society]], all, or almost all [[men]] have such a [[horror]] at the name of demons, that every one who, before reading the dissertation of apuleius, which sets forth the [[dignity]] of demons, should have [[read]] the title of the [[book]], on the demon of [[socrates]], would certainly have [[thought]] that the author was not a sane [[man]]. but what did even apuleius find to [[praise]] in the demons, except subtlety and [[strength]] of [[body]] and a higher place of habitation? for when he spoke generally concerning their manners, he said nothing that was [[good]], but very much that was [[bad]]. finally, no one, when he has [[read]] that [[book]], wonders that they [[desired]] to have even the obscenity of the stage among [[divine]] things, or that, wishing to be [[thought]] gods, they should be delighted with the crimes of the gods, or that all those [[sacred]] solemnities, whose obscenity occasions [[occasion]] laughter, and whose shameful [[cruelty]] causes [[horror]], should be in agreement with their [[passions]].

15. that the demons are not [[better]] than [[men]] because of their aerial bodies [[body]], or on account of their superior place of abode.

wherefore let not the [[mind]] truly [[religious]], and submitted to the true [[god]], suppose that demons are [[better]] than [[men]], because they have [[better]] bodies [[body]]. otherwise it must put many beasts before itself which are superior to us both in acuteness of the senses, in ease and quickness of movement,[pg 328] in [[strength]] and in long-continued vigour of [[body]]. what [[man]] can [[equal]] the eagle or the vulture in [[strength]] of vision? who can [[equal]] the dog in acuteness of smell? who can [[equal]] the hare, the stag, and all the birds in swiftness? who can [[equal]] in [[strength]] the lion or the elephant? who can [[equal]] in length of [[life]] the serpents, which are affirmed to put off old [[age]] along with their skin, and to return to [[youth]] again? but as we are [[better]] than all these by the possession of [[reason]] and understanding, so we ought also to be [[better]] than the demons by living [[good]] and [[virtuous]] lives [[life]]. for [[divine]] providence gave to them bodies [[body]] of a [[better]] quality than ours, that that in which we excel them might in this way be commended to us as deserving to be far more cared for than the [[body]], and that we should learn to despise the bodily excellence of the demons compared with goodness of [[life]], in [[respect]] of which we are [[better]] than they, knowing that we too shall have immortality of [[body]],—not an immortality tortured by eternal [[punishment]], but that which is consequent on purity of [[soul]].

but now, as regards loftiness of place, it is altogether ridiculous to be so influenced by the [[fact]] that the demons inhabit the air, and we the [[earth]], as to [[think]] that on that account they are to be put before us; for in this way we put all the birds before ourselves. but the birds, when they are weary with flying, or require to repair their bodies [[body]] with food, come back to the [[earth]] to rest or to feed, which the demons, they say, do not. are they, therefore, inclined to say that the birds are superior to us, and the demons superior to the birds? but if it be madness to [[think]] so, there is no [[reason]] why we should [[think]] that, on account of their inhabiting a loftier element, the demons have a claim to our [[religious]] submission. but as it is really the case that the birds of the air are not only not put before us who dwell on the [[earth]], but are even subjected to us on account of the [[dignity]] of the [[rational]] [[soul]] which is in us, so also it is the case that the demons, though they are aerial, are not [[better]] than we who are terrestrial because the air is higher than the [[earth]], but, on the contrary, [[men]] are to be put before demons because their despair is not to be compared to the [[hope]] of pious [[men]]. even that [[law]] of[pg 329] plato's, according to which he mutually orders and arranges the four elements, inserting between the two extreme elements—namely, [[fire]], which is in the highest [[degree]] mobile, and the immoveable earth—the two middle ones, air and water, that by how much the air is higher up than the water, and the [[fire]] than the air, by so much also are the waters higher than the [[earth]],—this [[law]], i say, sufficiently admonishes us not to estimate the merits [[merit]] of animated creatures according to the grades of the elements. and apuleius himself says that [[man]] is a terrestrial animal in [[common]] with the rest, who is nevertheless to be put far before aquatic animals, though [[plato]] puts the waters themselves before the [[land]]. by this he would have us [[understand]] that the same order is not to be observed when the [[question]] concerns the merits [[merit]] of animals, though it seems to be the true one in the gradation of bodies [[body]]; for it appears to be possible that a [[soul]] of a higher order may inhabit a [[body]] of a lower, and a [[soul]] of a lower order a [[body]] of a higher.

16. what apuleius the platonist [[thought]] concerning the manners and actions of demons.

the same apuleius, when speaking concerning the manners of demons, said that they are agitated with the same perturbations of [[mind]] as [[men]]; that they are provoked by injuries, propitiated by services and by gifts, rejoice in honours [[honour]], are delighted with a variety of [[sacred]] rites, and are annoyed if any of them be neglected. among other things, he also says that on them depend the divinations of augurs, soothsayers, and prophets [[prophet]], and the revelations of dreams [[dream]]; and that from them also are the [[miracles]] of the magicians. but, when giving a brief definition of them, he says, "demons are of an animal [[nature]], passive in [[soul]], [[rational]] in [[mind]], aerial in [[body]], eternal in [[time]]." "of which five things, the three first are [[common]] to them and us, the fourth peculiar to themselves, and the fifth [[common]] to them with the gods."[308] but i see that they have in [[common]] with the gods two of the first things, which they have in [[common]] with us. for he says that the gods also are animals; and when he is assigning to every order of beings its own element, he places us among the other[pg 330] terrestrial animals which [[live]] and [[feel]] upon the [[earth]]. wherefore, if the demons are animals as to genus, this is [[common]] to them, not only with [[men]], but also with the gods and with beasts; if they are [[rational]] as to their [[mind]], this is [[common]] to them with the gods and with [[men]]; if they are eternal in [[time]], this is [[common]] to them with the gods only; if they are passive as to their [[soul]], this is [[common]] to them with [[men]] only; if they are aerial in [[body]], in this they are alone. therefore it is no [[great]] thing for them to be of an animal [[nature]], for so also are the beasts; in being [[rational]] as to [[mind]], they are not above ourselves, for so are we also; and as to their being eternal as to [[time]], what is the advantage of that if they are not blessed? for [[better]] is temporal [[happiness]] than eternal misery. again, as to their being passive in [[soul]], how are they in this [[respect]] above us, since we also are so, but would not have been so had we not been miserable? also, as to their being aerial in [[body]], how much value is to be set on that, since a [[soul]] of any [[kind]] whatsoever is to be set above every [[body]]? and therefore [[religious]] [[worship]], which ought to be rendered from the [[soul]], is by no means due to that thing which is inferior to the [[soul]]. moreover, if he had, among those things which he says belong to demons, enumerated [[virtue]], [[wisdom]], [[happiness]], and affirmed that they have those things in [[common]] with the gods, and, like them, eternally, he would assuredly have attributed to them something greatly to be [[desired]], and much to be prized. and even in that case it would not have been our [[duty]] to [[worship]] them like [[god]] on account of these things, but rather to [[worship]] him from whom we [[know]] they had received them. but how much less are they really worthy of [[divine]] [[honour]],—those aerial animals who are only [[rational]] that they may be capable of misery, passive that they may be actually miserable, and eternal that it may be impossible for them to end their misery!

17. whether it is proper that [[men]] should [[worship]] those spirits from whose vices [[vice]] it is necessary that they be freed.

wherefore, to omit other things, and confine our attention to that which he says is [[common]] to the demons with us, let us ask this [[question]]: if all the four elements are full of their own animals, the [[fire]] and the air of [[immortal]], and the water and the[pg 331] [[earth]] of mortal ones, why are the souls [[soul]] of demons agitated by the whirlwinds and tempests of [[passions]]?—for the [[greek]] word πάθος means perturbation, whence he chose to call the demons "passive in [[soul]]," because the word passion, which is derived from πάθος, signified a commotion of the [[mind]] contrary to [[reason]]. why, then, are these things in the minds [[mind]] of demons which are not in beasts? for if anything of this [[kind]] appears in beasts, it is not perturbation, because it is not contrary to [[reason]], of which they are devoid. now it is foolishness or misery which is the cause of these perturbations in the case of [[men]], for we are not yet blessed in the possession of that [[perfection]] of [[wisdom]] which is promised to us at [[last]], when we shall be set [[free]] from our [[present]] [[mortality]]. but the gods, they say, are [[free]] from these perturbations, because they are not only eternal, but also blessed; for they also have the same [[kind]] of [[rational]] souls [[soul]], but most pure from all spot and plague. wherefore, if the gods are [[free]] from perturbation because they are blessed, not miserable animals, and the beasts are [[free]] from them because they are animals which are capable neither of blessedness nor misery, it remains that the demons, like [[men]], are [[subject]] to perturbations because they are not blessed but miserable animals. what folly, therefore, or rather what madness, to submit ourselves through any sentiment of [[religion]] to demons, when it belongs to the true [[religion]] to deliver us from that depravity which makes us like to them! for apuleius himself, although he is very sparing toward them, and thinks [[think]] they are worthy of [[divine]] honours [[honour]], is nevertheless compelled to confess that they are [[subject]] to anger; and the true [[religion]] commands us not to be moved with anger, but rather to resist it. the demons are won over by gifts; and the true [[religion]] commands us to favour no one on account of gifts received. the demons are flattered by honours [[honour]]; but the true [[religion]] commands us by no means to be moved by such things. the demons are haters of some [[men]] and lovers of others, not in consequence of a prudent and calm [[judgment]], but because of what he calls their "passive [[soul]];" whereas the true [[religion]] commands us to [[love]] even our enemies [[enemy]]. lastly, the true [[religion]] commands us to put away all disquietude of [[heart]], and agitation of [[mind]], and also all commotions and[pg 332] tempests of the [[soul]], which apuleius asserts to be continually swelling and surging in the souls [[soul]] of demons. why, therefore, except through foolishness and miserable error, shouldst thou humble thyself to [[worship]] a being to whom thou desirest to be unlike in thy [[life]]? and why shouldst thou [[pay]] [[religious]] homage to him whom thou art [[arts]] unwilling to imitate, when it is the highest [[duty]] of [[religion]] to imitate him whom thou worshippest?

18. what [[kind]] of [[religion]] that is which teaches [[teach]] that [[men]] ought to employ the advocacy of demons in order to be recommended to the favour of the [[good]] gods.

in [[vain]], therefore, have apuleius, and they who [[think]] with him, conferred on the demons the [[honour]] of placing them in the air, between the ethereal heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]], that they may carry to the gods the prayers of [[men]], to [[men]] the answers [[answer]] of the gods; for [[plato]] held, they say, that no [[god]] has intercourse with [[man]]. they who [[believe]] these things have [[thought]] it unbecoming that [[men]] should have intercourse with the gods, and the gods with [[men]], but a befitting thing that the demons should have intercourse with both gods and [[men]], presenting to the gods the petitions of [[men]], and conveying to [[men]] what the gods have granted; so that a chaste [[man]], and one who is a stranger to the crimes of the magic [[arts]], must use as patrons, through whom the gods may be induced to hear him, demons who [[love]] these crimes, although the very [[fact]] of his not loving them ought to have recommended him to them as one who deserved to be listened to with greater readiness and willingness on their part. they [[love]] the abominations of the stage, which chastity does not [[love]]. they [[love]], in the sorceries of the magicians, "a thousand [[arts]] of inflicting harm,"[309] which innocence does not [[love]]. yet both chastity and innocence, if they [[wish]] to obtain anything from the gods, will not be able to do so by their own merits [[merit]], except their enemies [[enemy]] act as mediators on their behalf. apuleius need not attempt to justify the fictions of the poets, and the mockeries of the stage. if [[human]] modesty can act so faithlessly towards itself as not only to [[love]] shameful things, but even to [[think]] that they are[pg 333] pleasing to the divinity, we can cite on the other side their own highest [[authority]] and teacher, [[plato]].

19. of the impiety of the magic art [[arts]], which is dependent on the assistance of malign spirits.

moreover, against those magic [[arts]], concerning which some [[men]], exceedingly wretched and exceedingly impious, delight to boast, may not [[public]] [[opinion]] itself be brought forward as a witness? for why are those [[arts]] so severely punished by the laws [[law]], if they are the works [[work]] of deities who ought to be worshipped? shall it be said that the christians [[christian]] have ordained those laws [[law]] by which magic [[arts]] are punished? with what other meaning, except that these sorceries are without [[doubt]] pernicious to the [[human]] [[race]], did the most illustrious poet say,

"by [[heaven]], i swear, and your dear [[life]], unwillingly these arms i wield, and take, to meet the coming strife, enchantment's [[sword]] and shield."[310]
and that also which he says in another place concerning magic [[arts]],

"i've seen him to another place transport the standing corn,"[311]
has reference to the [[fact]] that the fruits of one field are said to be transferred to another by these [[arts]] which this pestiferous and accursed doctrine teaches [[teach]]. does not cicero inform us that, among the laws [[law]] of the twelve tables, that is, the most ancient laws [[law]] of the romans, there was a [[law]] written which appointed a [[punishment]] to be inflicted on him who should do this?[312] lastly, was it before [[christian]] judges [[judge]] that apuleius himself was accused of magic [[arts]]?[313] had he known these [[arts]] to be [[divine]] and pious, and congruous with the works [[work]] of [[divine]] [[power]], he ought not only to have confessed, but also to have professed them, rather blaming the laws [[law]] by which these things were prohibited and pronounced worthy of condemnation, while they ought to have been held worthy of admiration and [[respect]].[pg 334] for by so doing, either he would have persuaded the judges [[judge]] to adopt his own [[opinion]], or, if they had shown their partiality for [[unjust]] laws [[law]], and condemned him to [[death]] notwithstanding his praising and commending such things, the demons would have bestowed on his [[soul]] such rewards [[reward]] as he deserved, who, in order to proclaim and set forth their [[divine]] works [[work]], had not feared the loss of his [[human]] [[life]]. as our martyrs, when that [[religion]] was charged on them as a crime, by which they knew they were made safe and most glorious throughout eternity, did not choose, by denying it, to escape temporal punishments [[punishment]], but rather by confessing, professing, and proclaiming it, by enduring all things for it with fidelity and fortitude, and by dying for it with pious calmness, put to shame the [[law]] by which that [[religion]] was prohibited, and caused its revocation. but there is extant a most copious and eloquent oration of this platonic philosopher, in which he defends himself against the charge of practising these [[arts]], affirming that he is wholly a stranger to them, and only wishing to show his innocence by denying such things as cannot be innocently committed. but all the [[miracles]] of the magicians, who he thinks [[think]] are justly deserving of condemnation, are performed according to the teaching and by the [[power]] of demons. why, then, does he [[think]] that they ought to be honoured? for he asserts that they are necessary, in order to [[present]] our prayers to the gods, and yet their works [[work]] are such as we must shun if we [[wish]] our prayers to reach the true [[god]]. again, i ask, what [[kind]] of prayers of [[men]] does he suppose are presented to the [[good]] gods by the demons? if magical prayers, they will have none such; if lawful prayers, they will not receive them through such beings. but if a sinner who is penitent pour out prayers, especially if he has committed any crime of sorcery, does he receive pardon through the intercession of those demons by whose instigation and [[help]] he has fallen into the [[sin]] he mourns? or do the demons themselves, in order that they may [[merit]] pardon for the penitent, first become penitents because they have deceived them? this no one ever said concerning the demons; for had this been the case, they would never have dared to seek for themselves [[divine]] honours [[honour]]. for how should they do so who [[desired]] by penitence to obtain the grace of[pg 335] pardon, seeing that such detestable [[pride]] could not [[exist]] along with a [[humility]] worthy of pardon?

20. whether we are to [[believe]] that the [[good]] gods are more willing to have intercourse with demons than with [[men]].

but does any urgent and most pressing cause compel the demons to mediate between the gods and [[men]], that they may offer the prayers of [[men]], and bring back the answers [[answer]] from the gods? and if so, what, [[pray]], is that cause, what is that so [[great]] necessity? because, say they, no [[god]] has intercourse with [[man]]. most admirable holiness of [[god]], which has no intercourse with a supplicating [[man]], and yet has intercourse with an arrogant demon! which has no intercourse with a penitent [[man]], and yet has intercourse with a deceiving demon! which has no intercourse with a [[man]] fleeing for refuge to the [[divine]] [[nature]], and yet has intercourse with a demon feigning divinity! which has no intercourse with a [[man]] seeking pardon, and yet has intercourse with a demon persuading to wickedness! which has no intercourse with a [[man]] expelling the poets by means of philosophical writings from a well-regulated [[state]], and yet has intercourse with a demon requesting from the princes [[prince]] and priests [[priest]] of a [[state]] the theatrical performance of the mockeries of the poets! which has no intercourse with the [[man]] who prohibits the ascribing of crime to the gods, and yet has intercourse with a demon who takes delight in the fictitious representation of their crimes! which has no intercourse with a [[man]] punishing the crimes of the magicians by just laws [[law]], and yet has intercourse with a demon teaching and practising magical arts! which has no intercourse with a [[man]] shunning the imitation of a demon, and yet has intercourse with a demon lying in wait for the deception of a man!

21. whether the gods use the demons as messengers and interpreters, and whether they are deceived by them willingly, or without their own [[knowledge]].

but herein, no [[doubt]], lies [[lie]] the [[great]] necessity for this absurdity, so unworthy of the gods, that the ethereal gods, who are concerned about [[human]] affairs, would not [[know]] what terrestrial [[men]] were doing unless the aerial demons should bring them [[intelligence]], because the ether is suspended far away from the [[earth]] and far above it, but the air is contiguous[pg 336] both to the ether and to the [[earth]]. o admirable wisdom! what else do these [[men]] [[think]] concerning the gods who, they say, are all in the highest [[degree]] [[good]], but that they are concerned about [[human]] affairs, lest they should seem unworthy of [[worship]], whilst, on the other hand, from the distance between the elements, they are ignorant of terrestrial things? it is on this account that they have supposed the demons to be necessary as agents, through whom the gods may inform themselves with [[respect]] to [[human]] affairs, and through whom, when necessary, they may succour [[men]]; and it is on account of this office that the demons themselves have been held as deserving of [[worship]]. if this be the case, then a demon is [[better]] known by these [[good]] gods through nearness of [[body]], than a [[man]] is by goodness of [[mind]]. o mournful necessity! or shall i not rather say detestable and [[vain]] error, that i may not impute vanity to the [[divine]] nature! for if the gods can, with their minds [[mind]] [[free]] from the hindrance of bodies [[body]], see our [[mind]], they do not need the demons as messengers from our [[mind]] to them; but if the ethereal gods, by means of their bodies [[body]], perceive the corporeal indices of minds [[mind]], as the countenance, [[speech]], motion, and thence [[understand]] what the demons tell them, then it is also possible that they may be deceived by the falsehoods of demons. moreover, if the divinity of the gods cannot be deceived by the demons, neither can it be ignorant of our actions. but i would they would tell me whether the demons have informed the gods that the fictions of the poets concerning the crimes of the gods displease [[plato]], concealing the [[pleasure]] which they themselves take in them; or whether they have concealed both, and have preferred that the gods should be ignorant with [[respect]] to this whole matter, or have told both, as well the pious prudence of [[plato]] with [[respect]] to the gods as their own [[lust]], which is injurious to the gods; or whether they have concealed plato's [[opinion]], according to which he was unwilling that the gods should be defamed with falsely alleged crimes through the impious licence of the poets, whilst they have not been ashamed nor afraid to make known their own wickedness, which make them [[love]] theatrical plays, in which the infamous deeds of the gods are celebrated. let them choose which[pg 337] they will of these four alternatives, and let them consider how much [[evil]] any one of them would require them to [[think]] of the gods. for if they choose the first, they must then confess that it was not possible for the [[good]] gods to dwell with the [[good]] [[plato]], though he sought to prohibit things injurious to them, whilst they dwelt with [[evil]] demons, who exulted in their injuries; and this because they suppose that the [[good]] gods can only [[know]] a [[good]] [[man]], placed at so [[great]] a distance from them, through the mediation of [[evil]] demons, whom they could [[know]] on account of their nearness to themselves.[314] if they shall choose the second, and shall say that both these things are concealed by the demons, so that the gods are wholly ignorant both of plato's most [[religious]] [[law]] and the sacrilegious [[pleasure]] of the demons, what, in that case, can the gods [[know]] to any [[profit]] with [[respect]] to [[human]] affairs through these mediating demons, when they do not [[know]] those things which are decreed, through the piety of [[good]] [[men]], for the [[honour]] of the [[good]] gods against the [[lust]] of [[evil]] demons? but if they shall choose the third, and reply that these intermediary demons have communicated, not only the [[opinion]] of [[plato]], which prohibited wrongs [[wrong]] to be done to the gods, but also their own delight in these wrongs [[wrong]], i would ask if such a communication is not rather an insult? now the gods, hearing both and knowing both, not only permit the approach of those malign demons, who [[desire]] and do things contrary to the [[dignity]] of the gods and the [[religion]] of [[plato]], but also, through these wicked demons, who are near to them, send [[good]] things to the [[good]] [[plato]], who is far away from them; for they inhabit such a place in the concatenated series of the elements, that they can come into contact with those by whom they are accused, but not with him by whom they are defended,—knowing the [[truth]] on both sides, but not being able to [[change]] the weight of the air and the [[earth]]. there remains the fourth supposition; but it is worse than the rest. for who will suffer it to be said that the demons have made known the calumnious fictions of the poets concerning the [[immortal]] gods, and also the disgraceful mockeries of the theatres, and their own most ardent [[lust]] after, and most sweet[pg 338] [[pleasure]] in these things, whilst they have concealed from them that [[plato]], with the gravity of a philosopher, gave it as his [[opinion]] that all these things ought to be removed from a well-regulated [[republic]]; so that the [[good]] gods are now compelled, through such messengers, to [[know]] the [[evil]] doings of the most wicked beings, that is to say, of the messengers themselves, and are not allowed to [[know]] the [[good]] deeds of the [[philosophers]], though the former are for the injury, but these latter for the [[honour]] of the gods themselves?

22. that we must, notwithstanding the [[opinion]] of apuleius, reject the [[worship]] of demons.

none of these four alternatives, then, is to be chosen; for we dare not suppose such unbecoming things concerning the gods as the adoption of any one of them would lead us to [[think]]. it remains, therefore, that no credence whatever is to be given to the [[opinion]] of apuleius and the other [[philosophers]] of the same school, namely, that the demons act as messengers and interpreters between the gods and [[men]] to carry our petitions from us to the gods, and to bring back to us the [[help]] of the gods. on the contrary, we must [[believe]] them to be spirits most eager to inflict harm, utterly alien from [[righteousness]], swollen with [[pride]], pale with envy, subtle in deceit; who dwell indeed in this air as in a prison, in keeping with their own [[character]], because, cast down from the height of the higher [[heaven]], they have been condemned to dwell in this element as the just [[reward]] of irretrievable transgression. but, though the air is situated above the [[earth]] and the waters, they are not on that account superior in [[merit]] to [[men]], who, though they do not surpass them as far as their earthly bodies [[body]] are concerned, do nevertheless far excel them through piety of [[mind]],—they having made [[choice]] of the true [[god]] as their helper. over many, however, who are manifestly unworthy of participation in the true [[religion]], they tyrannize as over captives whom they have subdued,—the [[greatest]] part of whom they have persuaded of their divinity by wonderful and lying signs, consisting either of deeds or of predictions. some, nevertheless, who have more attentively and diligently considered their vices [[vice]], they have not been able to persuade that they are gods, and so have feigned themselves to be messengers[pg 339] between the gods and [[men]]. some, indeed, have [[thought]] that not even this latter [[honour]] ought to be acknowledged as belonging to them, not believing that they were gods, because they saw that they were wicked, whereas the gods, according to their view, are all [[good]]. nevertheless they dared not say that they were wholly unworthy of all [[divine]] [[honour]], for [[fear]] of offending the multitude, by whom, through inveterate superstition, the demons were served by the performance of many rites, and the erection of many temples.

23. what hermes trismegistus [[thought]] concerning idolatry, and from what source he knew that the superstitions of [[egypt]] were to be abolished.

the egyptian hermes, whom they call trismegistus, had a different [[opinion]] concerning those demons. apuleius, indeed, denies that they are gods; but when he says that they hold a middle place between the gods and [[men]], so that they seem to be necessary for [[men]] as mediators between them and the gods, he does not distinguish between the [[worship]] due to them and the [[religious]] homage due to the supernal gods. this egyptian, however, says that there are some gods made by the supreme [[god]], and some made by [[men]]. any one who hears this, as i have stated it, no [[doubt]] supposes that it has reference to images, because they are the works [[work]] of the hands of [[men]]; but he asserts that visible and tangible images are, as it were, only the bodies [[body]] of the gods, and that there dwell in them [[certain]] spirits, which have been invited to come into them, and which have [[power]] to inflict harm, or to fulfil the desires [[desire]] of those by whom [[divine]] honours [[honour]] and services are rendered to them. to unite, therefore, by a [[certain]] art [[arts]], those invisible spirits to visible and material things, so as to make, as it were, animated bodies [[body]], dedicated and given up to those spirits who inhabit them,—this, he says, is to make gods, adding that [[men]] have received this [[great]] and wonderful [[power]]. i will give the words of this egyptian as they have been translated into our tongue: "and, since we have undertaken to discourse concerning the relationship and fellowship between [[men]] and the gods, [[know]], o æsculapius, the [[power]] and [[strength]] of [[man]]. as the [[lord]] and [[father]], or that which is highest, even [[god]], is the maker of the celestial gods, so [[man]] is the[pg 340] maker of the gods who are in the temples, content to dwell near to [[men]]."[315] and a little after he says, "thus [[humanity]], always mindful of its [[nature]] and origin, perseveres in the imitation of divinity; and as the [[lord]] and [[father]] made eternal gods, that they should be like himself, so [[humanity]] fashioned its own gods according to the likeness of its own countenance." when this æsculapius, to whom especially he was speaking, had answered him, and had said, "dost thou mean the statues, o trismegistus?"—"yes, the statues," replied he, "however unbelieving thou art [[arts]], o æsculapius,—the statues, animated, and full of sensation and spirit, and who do such [[great]] and wonderful things,—the statues, prescient of future things, and foretelling them by lot, by [[prophet]], by dreams [[dream]], and many other things, who bring diseases on [[men]] and cure them again, giving them joy or [[sorrow]] according to their merits [[merit]]. dost thou not [[know]], æsculapius, that [[egypt]] is an image of [[heaven]], or, more truly, a translation and descent of all things which are ordered and transacted there,—that it is, in [[truth]], if we may say so, to be the temple of the whole [[world]]? and yet, as it becomes the prudent [[man]] to [[know]] all things beforehand, ye ought not to be ignorant of this, that there is a [[time]] coming when it shall appear that the [[egyptians]] have all in [[vain]], with pious [[mind]], and with most scrupulous diligence, waited on the divinity, and when all their holy [[worship]] shall come to nought, and be found to be in [[vain]]."

hermes then follows out at [[great]] length the statements of this passage, in which he seems to predict the [[present]] [[time]], in which the [[christian]] [[religion]] is overthrowing all lying figments with a vehemence and [[liberty]] proportioned to its superior [[truth]] and holiness, in order that the grace of the true saviour may deliver [[men]] from those gods which [[man]] has made, and [[subject]] them to that [[god]] by whom [[man]] was made. but when hermes predicts these things, he speaks as one who is a friend to these same mockeries of demons, and does not clearly express the name of [[christ]]. on the contrary, he deplores, as if it had already taken place, the future abolition of those things by the observance of which there was maintained[pg 341] in [[egypt]] a resemblance of [[heaven]],—he bears witness to [[christianity]] by a [[kind]] of mournful prophecy. now it was with reference to such that the apostle said, that "knowing [[god]], they glorified him not as [[god]], neither were thankful, but became [[vain]] in their imaginations [[imagination]], and their foolish [[heart]] was darkened; professing themselves to be [[wise]], they became fools [[fool]], and changed the [[glory]] of the incorruptible [[god]] into the likeness of the image of corruptible [[man]],"[316] and so on, for the whole passage is too long to quote. for hermes makes many such statements agreeable to the [[truth]] concerning the one true [[god]] who fashioned this [[world]]. and i [[know]] not how he has become so bewildered by that "darkening of the heart" as to stumble into the expression of a [[desire]] that [[men]] should always continue in subjection to those gods which he confesses to be made by [[men]], and to bewail their future removal; as if there could be anything more wretched than [[mankind]] tyrannized over by the [[work]] of his own hands, since [[man]], by worshipping the works [[work]] of his own hands, may more easily cease to be [[man]], than the works [[work]] of his hands can, through his [[worship]] of them, become gods. for it can sooner happen that [[man]], who has received an honourable position, may, through lack of understanding, become comparable to the beasts, than that the works [[work]] of [[man]] may become preferable to the [[work]] of [[god]], made in his own image, that is, to [[man]] himself. wherefore deservedly is [[man]] left to fall away from him who made him, when he prefers to himself that which he himself has made.

for these [[vain]], deceitful, pernicious, sacrilegious things did the egyptian hermes [[sorrow]], because he knew that the [[time]] was coming when they should be removed. but his [[sorrow]] was as impudently expressed as his [[knowledge]] was imprudently obtained; for it was not the holy spirit who revealed these things to him, as he had done to the holy prophets [[prophet]], who, foreseeing these things, said with exultation, "if a [[man]] shall make gods, lo, they are no gods;"[317] and in another place, "and it shall come to pass in that day, saith the [[lord]], that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the [[land]], and they shall no more be remembered."[318] but the holy isaiah prophesies expressly[pg 342] concerning [[egypt]] in reference to this matter, saying, "and the idols of [[egypt]] shall be moved at his presence, and their [[heart]] shall be overcome in them,"[319] and other things to the same effect. and with the [[prophet]] are to be classed those who rejoiced that that which they knew was to come had actually come,—as simeon, or anna, who immediately recognised [[jesus]] when he was born, or elisabeth, who in the spirit recognised him when he was conceived, or peter, who said by the revelation of the [[father]], "thou art [[arts]] [[christ]], the [[son]] of the living [[god]]."[320] but to this egyptian those spirits indicated the [[time]] of their own destruction, who also, when the [[lord]] was [[present]] in the flesh, said with trembling, "art thou come hither to [[destroy]] us before the [[time]]?"[321] meaning by destruction before the [[time]], either that very destruction which they expected to come, but which they did not [[think]] would come so suddenly as it appeared to have done, or only that destruction which consisted in their being brought into contempt by being made known. and, indeed, this was a destruction before the [[time]], that is, before the [[time]] of [[judgment]], when they are to be punished with eternal damnation, together with all [[men]] who are implicated in their wickedness, as the true [[religion]] declares, which neither errs nor leads into error; for it is not like him who, blown hither and thither by every wind of doctrine, and mixing true things with things which are false, bewails as about to perish a [[religion]] which he afterwards confesses to be error.

24. how hermes openly confessed the error of his forefathers, the coming destruction of which he nevertheless bewailed.

after a long interval, hermes again comes back to the [[subject]] of the gods which [[men]] have made, saying as follows: "but enough on this [[subject]]. let us return to [[man]] and to [[reason]], that [[divine]] gift on account of which [[man]] has been called a [[rational]] animal. for the things which have been said concerning [[man]], wonderful though they are, are less wonderful than those which have been said concerning [[reason]]. for [[man]] to discover the [[divine]] [[nature]], and to make it, surpasses the wonder of all other wonderful things. because, therefore, our forefathers erred very far with [[respect]] to the[pg 343] [[knowledge]] of the gods, through incredulity and through want of attention to their [[worship]] and service, they [[invented]] this art [[arts]] of making gods; and this art [[arts]] once [[invented]], they associated with it a suitable [[virtue]] borrowed from universal [[nature]], and, being incapable of making souls [[soul]], they evoked those of demons or of angels, and [[united]] them with these holy images and [[divine]] mysteries, in order that through these souls [[soul]] the images might have [[power]] to do [[good]] or harm to [[men]]." i [[know]] not whether the demons themselves could have been made, even by adjuration, to confess as he has confessed in these words: "because our forefathers erred very far with [[respect]] to the [[knowledge]] of the gods, through incredulity and through want of attention to their [[worship]] and service, they [[invented]] the art [[arts]] of making gods." does he say that it was a moderate [[degree]] of error which resulted in their discovery of the art [[arts]] of making gods, or was he content to say "they erred?" no; he must needs add "very far," and say, "they erred very far." it was this [[great]] error and incredulity, then, of their forefathers who did not attend to the [[worship]] and service of the gods, which was the origin of the art [[arts]] of making gods. and yet this [[wise]] [[man]] grieves over the ruin of this art [[arts]] at some future [[time]], as if it were a [[divine]] [[religion]]. is he not verily compelled by [[divine]] influence, on the one hand, to reveal the [[past]] error of his forefathers, and by a diabolical influence, on the other hand, to bewail the future [[punishment]] of demons? for if their forefathers, by erring very far with [[respect]] to the [[knowledge]] of the gods, through incredulity and aversion of [[mind]] from their [[worship]] and service, [[invented]] the art [[arts]] of making gods, what wonder is it that all that is done by this detestable art [[arts]], which is opposed to the [[divine]] [[religion]], should be taken away by that [[religion]], when [[truth]] corrects error, [[faith]] refutes incredulity, and conversion rectifies aversion?

for if he had only said, without mentioning the cause, that his forefathers had discovered the art [[arts]] of making gods, it would have been our [[duty]], if we paid any regard to what is [[right]] and pious, to consider and to see that they could never have attained to this art [[arts]] if they had not erred from the [[truth]], if they had believed those things which are worthy of [[god]], if they had attended to [[divine]] [[worship]] and service. however,[pg 344] if we alone should say that the causes of this art [[arts]] were to be found in the [[great]] error and incredulity of [[men]], and aversion of the [[mind]] erring from and unfaithful to [[divine]] [[religion]], the impudence of those who resist the [[truth]] were in some way to be borne with; but when he who admires in [[man]], above all other things, this [[power]] which it has been granted him to practise, and sorrows [[sorrow]] because a [[time]] is coming when all those figments of gods [[invented]] by [[men]] shall even be commanded by the laws [[law]] to be taken away,—when even this [[man]] confesses nevertheless, and explains the causes which [[led]] to the discovery of this art [[arts]], saying that their [[ancestors]], through [[great]] error and incredulity, and through not attending to the [[worship]] and service of the gods, [[invented]] this art [[arts]] of making gods,—what ought we to say, or rather to do, but to give to the [[lord]] our [[god]] all the thanks we are able, because he has taken away those things by causes the contrary of those which [[led]] to their institution? for that which the prevalence of error instituted, the way of [[truth]] took away; that which incredulity instituted, [[faith]] took away; that which aversion from [[divine]] [[worship]] and service instituted, conversion to the one true and holy [[god]] took away. nor was this the case only in [[egypt]], for which [[country]] alone the spirit of the demons lamented in hermes, but in all the [[earth]], which sings to the [[lord]] a new [[song]],[322] as the truly holy and truly prophetic scriptures [[scripture]] have predicted, in which it is written, "sing unto the [[lord]] a new [[song]]; sing unto the [[lord]], all the [[earth]]." for the title of this psalm is, "when the house was built after the captivity." for a house is being built to the [[lord]] in all the [[earth]], even the [[city]] of [[god]], which is the holy [[church]], after that captivity in which demons held captive those [[men]] who, through [[faith]] in [[god]], became living stones in the house. for although [[man]] made gods, it did not [[follow]] that he who made them was not held captive by them, when, by worshipping them, he was drawn into fellowship with them,—into the fellowship not of stolid idols, but of cunning demons; for what are idols but what they are represented to be in the same scriptures [[scripture]], "they have [[eyes]], but they do not see,"[323] and, though artistically fashioned, are[pg 345] still without [[life]] and sensation? but unclean spirits, associated through that wicked art [[arts]] with these same idols, have miserably taken captive the souls [[soul]] of their worshippers, by bringing them down into fellowship with themselves. whence the apostle says, "we [[know]] that an idol is nothing, but those things which the gentiles [[sacrifice]] they [[sacrifice]] to demons, and not to [[god]]; and i would not ye should have fellowship with demons."[324] after this captivity, therefore, in which [[men]] were held by malign demons, the house of [[god]] is being built in all the [[earth]]; whence the title of that psalm in which it is said, "sing unto the [[lord]] a new [[song]]; sing unto the [[lord]], all the [[earth]]. sing unto the [[lord]], bless his name; declare well his salvation from day to day. declare his [[glory]] among the nations, among all [[people]] his wonderful things. for [[great]] is the [[lord]], and much to be praised: he is terrible above all gods. for all the gods of the nations are demons: but the [[lord]] made the heavens [[heaven]]."[325]

wherefore he who sorrowed because a [[time]] was coming when the [[worship]] of idols should be abolished, and the domination of the demons over those who worshipped them, wished, under the influence of a demon, that that captivity should always continue, at the cessation of which that psalm celebrates the building of the house of the [[lord]] in all the [[earth]]. hermes foretold these things with [[grief]], the [[prophet]] with joyfulness; and because the spirit is victorious who sang these things through the ancient prophets [[prophet]], even hermes himself was compelled in a wonderful manner to confess, that those very things which he wished not to be removed, and at the prospect of whose removal he was sorrowful, had been instituted, not by prudent, faithful, and [[religious]], but by erring and unbelieving [[men]], averse to the [[worship]] and service of the gods. and although he calls them gods, nevertheless, when he says that they were made by such [[men]] as we certainly ought not to be, he shows, whether he will or not, that they are not to be worshipped by those who do not resemble these image-makers, that is, by prudent, faithful, and [[religious]] [[men]], at the same [[time]] also making it manifest that the very [[men]] who made them involved themselves in the [[worship]] of those as gods who were not gods.[pg 346] for true is the saying of the [[prophet]], "if a [[man]] make gods, lo, they are no gods."[326] such gods, therefore, acknowledged by such worshippers and made by such [[men]], did hermes call "gods made by [[men]]," that is to say, demons, through some art [[arts]] of i [[know]] not what description, bound by the chains of their own lusts to images. but, nevertheless, he did not agree with that [[opinion]] of the platonic apuleius, of which we have already shown the incongruity and absurdity, namely, that they were interpreters and intercessors between the gods whom [[god]] made, and [[men]] whom the same [[god]] made, bringing to [[god]] the prayers of [[men]], and from [[god]] the gifts given in [[answer]] to these prayers. for it is exceedingly stupid to [[believe]] that gods whom [[men]] have made have more influence with gods whom [[god]] has made than [[men]] themselves have, whom the very same [[god]] has made. and consider, too, that it is a demon which, bound by a [[man]] to an image by means of an impious art [[arts]], has been made a [[god]], but a [[god]] to such a [[man]] only, not to every [[man]]. what [[kind]] of [[god]], therefore, is that which no [[man]] would make but one erring, incredulous, and averse to the true [[god]]? moreover, if the demons which are worshipped in the temples, being introduced by some [[kind]] of [[strange]] art [[arts]] into images, that is, into visible representations of themselves, by those [[men]] who by this art [[arts]] made gods when they were straying away from, and were averse to the [[worship]] and service of the gods,—if, i say, those demons are neither mediators nor interpreters between [[men]] and the gods, both on account of their own most wicked and base manners, and because [[men]], though erring, incredulous, and averse from the [[worship]] and service of the gods, are nevertheless beyond [[doubt]] [[better]] than the demons whom they themselves have evoked, then it remains to be affirmed that what [[power]] they possess they possess as demons, doing harm by bestowing pretended benefits,—harm all the greater for the deception,—or else openly and undisguisedly doing [[evil]] to [[men]]. they cannot, however, do anything of this [[kind]] unless where they are permitted by the deep and secret providence of [[god]], and then only so far as they are permitted. when, however, they are permitted, it is not because they, being midway between[pg 347] [[men]] and the gods, have through the [[friendship]] of the gods [[great]] [[power]] over [[men]]; for these demons cannot possibly be [[friends]] to the [[good]] gods who dwell in the holy and heavenly habitation, by whom we mean holy angels and [[rational]] creatures, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers [[power]], from whom they are as far separated in disposition and [[character]] as [[vice]] is distant from [[virtue]], wickedness from goodness.

25. concerning those things which may be [[common]] to the holy angels and to [[men]].

wherefore we must by no means seek, through the supposed mediation of demons, to avail ourselves of the benevolence or beneficence of the gods, or rather of the [[good]] angels, but through resembling them in the possession of a [[good]] will, through which we are with them, and [[live]] with them, and [[worship]] with them the same [[god]], although we cannot see them with the [[eyes]] of our flesh. but it is not in locality we are distant from them, but in [[merit]] of [[life]], caused by our miserable unlikeness to them in will, and by the weakness of our [[character]]; for the mere [[fact]] of our dwelling on [[earth]] under the conditions of [[life]] in the flesh does not prevent our fellowship with them. it is only prevented when we, in the impurity of our hearts [[heart]], [[mind]] earthly things. but in this [[present]] [[time]], while we are being healed that we may eventually be as they are, we are brought near to them by [[faith]], if by their assistance we [[believe]] that he who is their blessedness is also ours.

26. that all the [[religion]] of the pagans has reference to [[dead]] [[men]].

it is certainly a remarkable thing how this egyptian, when expressing his [[grief]] that a [[time]] was coming when those things would be taken away from [[egypt]], which he confesses to have been [[invented]] by [[men]] erring, incredulous, and averse to the service of [[divine]] [[religion]], says, among other things, "then shall that [[land]], the most holy place of shrines and temples, be full of sepulchres and [[dead]] [[men]]," as if, in sooth, if these things were not taken away, [[men]] would not die! as if [[dead]] bodies [[body]] could be buried elsewhere than in the ground! as if, as [[time]] advanced, the number of sepulchres must not necessarily increase in proportion to the increase of the number of[pg 348] the dead! but they who are of a perverse [[mind]], and opposed to us, suppose that what he grieves for is that the memorials of our martyrs were to succeed to their temples and shrines, in order, forsooth, that they may have grounds for thinking that gods were worshipped by the pagans in temples, but that [[dead]] [[men]] are worshipped by us in sepulchres. for with such blindness do impious [[men]], as it were, stumble over mountains, and will not see the things which strike their own [[eyes]], that they do not attend to the [[fact]] that in all the literature of the pagans there are not found any, or scarcely any gods, who have not been [[men]], to whom, when [[dead]], [[divine]] honours [[honour]] have been paid. i will not enlarge on the [[fact]] that varro says that all [[dead]] [[men]] are [[thought]] by them to be gods manes, and proves it by those [[sacred]] rites which are performed in [[honour]] of almost all the [[dead]], among which he mentions [[funeral]] games, considering this the very highest proof of divinity, because games are only wont to be celebrated in [[honour]] of divinities. hermes himself, of whom we are now treating, in that same [[book]] in which, as if foretelling future things, he says with [[sorrow]], "then shall that [[land]], the most holy place of shrines and temples, be full of sepulchres and [[dead]] [[men]]," testifies that the gods of [[egypt]] were [[dead]] [[men]]. for, having said that their forefathers, erring very far with [[respect]] to the [[knowledge]] of the gods, incredulous and inattentive to the [[divine]] [[worship]] and service, [[invented]] the art [[arts]] of making gods, with which art [[arts]], when [[invented]], they associated the appropriate [[virtue]] which is inherent in universal [[nature]], and by mixing up that [[virtue]] with this art [[arts]], they called forth the souls [[soul]] of demons or of angels (for they could not make souls), and caused them to take possession of, or associate themselves with holy images and [[divine]] mysteries, in order that through these souls [[soul]] the images might have [[power]] to do [[good]] or harm to [[men]];—having said this, he goes on, as it were, to prove it by illustrations, saying, "thy grandsire, o æsculapius, the first discoverer of medicine, to whom a temple was consecrated in a mountain of libya, near to the shore of the crocodiles, in which temple lies [[lie]] his earthly [[man]], that is, his [[body]],—for the [[better]] part of him, or rather the whole of him, if the whole [[man]] is in the [[intelligent]] [[life]], went back to [[heaven]],—affords[pg 349] even now by his divinity all those helps to infirm [[men]], which formerly he was wont to afford to them by the art [[arts]] of medicine." he says, therefore, that a [[dead]] [[man]] was worshipped as a [[god]] in that place where he had his sepulchre. he deceives [[men]] by a falsehood, for the [[man]] "went back to [[heaven]]." then he adds, "does not hermes, who was my grandsire, and whose name i bear, abiding in the [[country]] which is called by his name, [[help]] and preserve all mortals who come to him from every quarter?" for this elder hermes, that is, mercury, who, he says, was his grandsire, is said to be buried in hermopolis, that is, in the [[city]] called by his name; so here are two gods whom he affirms to have been [[men]], æsculapius and mercury. now concerning æsculapius, both the greeks [[greek]] and the latins [[think]] the same thing; but as to mercury, there are many who do not [[think]] that he was formerly a mortal, though hermes testifies that he was his grandsire. but are these two different individuals [[individual]] who were called by the same name? i will not dispute much whether they are different individuals [[individual]] or not. it is sufficient to [[know]] that this mercury of whom hermes speaks is, as well as æsculapius, a [[god]] who once was a [[man]], according to the testimony of this same trismegistus, esteemed so [[great]] by his countrymen, and also the grandson of mercury himself.

hermes goes on to say, "but do we [[know]] how many [[good]] things isis, the [[wife]] of osiris, bestows when she is propitious, and what [[great]] opposition she can offer when enraged?" then, in order to show that there were gods made by [[men]] through this art [[arts]], he goes on to say, "for it is easy for earthly and mundane gods to be angry, being made and composed by [[men]] out of either [[nature]];" thus giving us to [[understand]] that he believed that demons were formerly the souls [[soul]] of [[dead]] [[men]], which, as he says, by means of a [[certain]] art [[arts]] [[invented]] by [[men]] very far in error, incredulous, and irreligious, were caused to take possession of images, because they who made such gods were not able to make souls [[soul]]. when, therefore, he says "either [[nature]]," he means [[soul]] and [[body]],—the demon being the [[soul]], and the image the [[body]]. what, then, becomes of that mournful complaint, that the [[land]] of [[egypt]], the most holy place of shrines and temples, was to be full of sepulchres and[pg 350] [[dead]] [[men]]? verily, the fallacious spirit, by whose inspiration hermes spoke these things, was compelled to confess through him that even already that [[land]] was full of sepulchres and of [[dead]] [[men]], whom they were worshipping as gods. but it was the [[grief]] of the demons which was expressing itself through his mouth, who were sorrowing on account of the punishments [[punishment]] which were about to fall upon them at the tombs of the martyrs. for in many such places they are tortured and compelled to confess, and are cast out of the bodies [[body]] of [[men]], of which they had taken possession.

27. concerning the [[nature]] of the [[honour]] which the christians [[christian]] [[pay]] to their martyrs.

but, nevertheless, we do not build temples, and ordain priests [[priest]], rites, and sacrifices [[sacrifice]] for these same martyrs; for they are not our gods, but their [[god]] is our [[god]]. certainly we [[honour]] their reliquaries, as the memorials of holy [[men]] of [[god]] who strove for the [[truth]] even to the [[death]] of their bodies [[body]], that the true [[religion]] might be made known, and false and fictitious religions [[religion]] exposed. for if there were some before them who [[thought]] that these religions [[religion]] were really false and fictitious, they were afraid to give expression to their convictions. but who ever heard a [[priest]] of the faithful, standing at an altar built for the [[honour]] and [[worship]] of [[god]] over the holy [[body]] of some martyr, say in the prayers, i offer to thee a [[sacrifice]], o peter, or o paul, or o cyprian? for it is to [[god]] that sacrifices [[sacrifice]] are offered at their tombs,—the [[god]] who made them both [[men]] and martyrs, and associated them with holy angels in celestial [[honour]]; and the [[reason]] why we [[pay]] such honours [[honour]] to their memory is, that by so doing we may both give thanks to the true [[god]] for their victories [[victory]], and, by recalling them afresh to remembrance, may stir ourselves up to imitate them by seeking to obtain like crowns [[crown]] and palms, calling to our [[help]] that same [[god]] on whom they called. therefore, whatever honours [[honour]] the [[religious]] may [[pay]] in the places of the martyrs, they are but honours [[honour]] rendered to their memory,[327] not [[sacred]] rites or sacrifices [[sacrifice]] offered to [[dead]] [[men]] as to gods. and even such as bring thither food,—which, indeed, is not done by the [[better]] christians [[christian]], and in most places of[pg 351] the [[world]] is not done at all,—do so in order that it may be sanctified to them through the merits [[merit]] of the martyrs, in the name of the [[lord]] of the martyrs, first presenting the food and offering prayer, and thereafter taking it away to be eaten, or to be in part bestowed upon the needy.[328] but he who knows [[know]] the one [[sacrifice]] of christians [[christian]], which is the [[sacrifice]] offered in those places, also knows [[know]] that these are not sacrifices [[sacrifice]] offered to the martyrs. it is, then, neither with [[divine]] honours [[honour]] nor with [[human]] crimes, by which they [[worship]] their gods, that we [[honour]] our martyrs; neither do we offer sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to them, or convert the crimes of the gods into their [[sacred]] rites. for let those who will and can [[read]] the letter of alexander to his [[mother]] olympias, in which he tells the things which were revealed to him by the [[priest]] leon, and let those who have [[read]] it recall to memory what it contains, that they may see what [[great]] abominations have been handed down to memory, not by poets, but by the mystic writings of the [[egyptians]], concerning the [[goddess]] isis, the [[wife]] of osiris, and the parents of both, all of whom, according to these writings, were [[royal]] personages. isis, when sacrificing to her parents, is said to have discovered a crop of barley, of which she brought some ears to the [[king]] her husband, and his councillor mercurius, and hence they identify her with ceres. those who [[read]] the letter may there see what was the [[character]] of those [[people]] to whom when [[dead]] [[sacred]] rites were instituted as to gods, and what those deeds of theirs were which furnished the [[occasion]] for these rites. let them not once dare to compare in any [[respect]] those [[people]], though they hold them to be gods, to our holy martyrs, though we do not hold them to be gods. for we do not ordain priests [[priest]] and offer sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to our martyrs, as they do to their [[dead]] [[men]], for that would be incongruous, undue, and unlawful, such being due only to [[god]]; and thus we do not delight them with their own crimes, or with such shameful plays as those in which the crimes of the gods are celebrated, which are either real crimes committed by them at a [[time]] when they were [[men]], or else, if they never were [[men]], fictitious crimes [[invented]] for the [[pleasure]] of noxious demons. the [[god]] of [[socrates]], if he had a[pg 352] [[god]], cannot have belonged to this class of demons. but perhaps they who wished to excel in this art [[arts]] of making gods, imposed a [[god]] of this sort on a [[man]] who was a stranger to, and [[innocent]] of any connection with that art [[arts]]. what need we say more? no one who is even moderately [[wise]] imagines that demons are to be worshipped on account of the blessed [[life]] which is to be after [[death]]. but perhaps they will say that all the gods are [[good]], but that of the demons some are [[bad]] and some [[good]], and that it is the [[good]] who are to be worshipped, in order that through them we may attain to the eternally blessed [[life]]. to the examination of this [[opinion]] we will devote the following [[book]].

[pg 353]

book ninth.

argument.

having in the preceding [[book]] shown that the [[worship]] of demons must be abjured, since they in a thousand ways proclaim themselves to be wicked spirits, augustine in this [[book]] meets those who allege a distinction among demons, some being [[evil]], while others are [[good]]; and, having exploded this distinction, he proves that to no demon, but to [[christ]] alone, belongs the office of providing [[men]] with eternal blessedness.

1. the point at which the discussion has arrived, and what remains to be handled.

some have advanced the [[opinion]] that there are both [[good]] and [[bad]] gods; but some, thinking more respectfully of the gods have attributed to them so much [[honour]] and [[praise]] as to preclude the supposition of any [[god]] being wicked. but those who have maintained that there are wicked gods as well as [[good]] ones have included the demons under the name "gods," and sometimes, though more rarely, have called the gods demons; so that they admit that [[jupiter]], whom they make the [[king]] and head of all the rest, is called a demon by [[homer]].[329] those, on the other hand, who maintain that the gods are all [[good]], and far more excellent than the [[men]] who are justly called [[good]], are moved by the actions of the demons, which they can neither deny nor impute to the gods whose goodness they affirm, to distinguish between gods and demons; so that, whenever they find anything offensive in the deeds or sentiments by which unseen spirits manifest their [[power]], they [[believe]] this to proceed not from the gods, but from the demons. at the same [[time]] they [[believe]] that, as no [[god]] can hold direct intercourse with [[men]], these demons hold the position of mediators, ascending with prayers, and returning with gifts. this is the [[opinion]] of the platonists, the ablest and most esteemed of their [[philosophers]], with whom we therefore chose to debate this [[question]],—whether the [[worship]] of a number of gods is of[pg 354] any service towards obtaining blessedness in the future [[life]]. and this is the [[reason]] why, in the preceding [[book]], we have inquired how the demons, who take [[pleasure]] in such things as [[good]] and [[wise]] [[men]] loathe and execrate, in the sacrilegious and immoral fictions which the poets have written, not of [[men]], but of the gods themselves, and in the wicked and [[criminal]] [[violence]] of magical [[arts]], can be regarded as more nearly related and more friendly to the gods than [[men]] are, and can mediate between [[good]] [[men]] and the [[good]] gods; and it has been demonstrated that this is absolutely impossible.

2. whether among the demons, inferior to the gods, there are any [[good]] spirits under whose guardianship the [[human]] [[soul]] might reach true blessedness.

this [[book]], then, ought, according to the promise made in the end of the preceding one, to contain a discussion, not of the difference which exists among the gods, who, according to the platonists, are all [[good]], nor of the difference between gods and demons, the former of whom they separate by a wide interval from [[men]], while the latter are placed intermediately between the gods and [[men]], but of the difference, since they make one, among the demons themselves. this we shall discuss so far as it bears on our theme. it has been the [[common]] and usual [[belief]] that some of the demons are [[bad]], others [[good]]; and this [[opinion]], whether it be that of the platonists or any other sect, must by no means be passed over in [[silence]], lest some one suppose he ought to cultivate the [[good]] demons in order that by their mediation he may be accepted by the gods, all of whom he believes [[belief]] to be [[good]], and that he may [[live]] with them after [[death]]; whereas he would thus be ensnared in the toils of wicked spirits, and would wander far from the true [[god]], with whom alone, and in whom alone, the [[human]] [[soul]], that is to say, the [[soul]] that is [[rational]] and intellectual, is blessed.

3. what apuleius attributes to the demons, to whom, though he does not deny them [[reason]], he does not ascribe [[virtue]].

what, then, is the difference between [[good]] and [[evil]] demons? for the platonist apuleius, in a treatise on this whole [[subject]],[pg 355][330] while he says a [[great]] deal about their aerial bodies [[body]], has not a word to say of the [[spiritual]] virtues [[virtue]] with which, if they were [[good]], they must have been endowed. not a word has he said, then, of that which could give them [[happiness]]; but proof of their misery he has given, acknowledging that their [[mind]], by which they rank as reasonable beings, is not only not imbued and fortified with [[virtue]] so as to resist all unreasonable [[passions]], but that it is somehow agitated with tempestuous emotions, and is thus on a level with the [[mind]] of foolish [[men]]. his own words are: "it is this class of demons the poets refer to, when, without serious error, they feign that the gods hate and [[love]] individuals [[individual]] among [[men]], prospering and ennobling some, and opposing and distressing others. therefore [[pity]], indignation, [[grief]], joy, every [[human]] emotion is experienced by the demons, with the same mental disturbance, and the same tide of feeling and [[thought]]. these turmoils and tempests banish them far from the tranquillity of the celestial gods." can there be any [[doubt]] that in these words it is not some inferior part of their [[spiritual]] [[nature]], but the very [[mind]] by which the demons hold their rank as [[rational]] beings, which he says is tossed with passion like a stormy sea? they cannot, then, be compared even to [[wise]] [[men]], who with undisturbed [[mind]] resist these perturbations to which they are exposed in this [[life]], and from which [[human]] infirmity is never exempt, and who do not yield themselves to approve of or perpetrate anything which might deflect them from the path of [[wisdom]] and [[law]] of rectitude. they resemble in [[character]], though not in bodily appearance, wicked and foolish [[men]]. i might indeed say they are worse, inasmuch as they have grown old in [[iniquity]], and incorrigible by [[punishment]]. their [[mind]], as apuleius says, is a sea tossed with tempest, having no rallying point of [[truth]] or [[virtue]] in their [[soul]] from which they can resist their turbulent and depraved emotions.

4. the [[opinion]] of the peripatetics and stoics about mental emotions.

among the [[philosophers]] there are two opinions [[opinion]] about these mental emotions, which the greeks [[greek]] call πάθη, while some of our own writers, as cicero, call them perturbations,[331] some[pg 356] affections, and some, to render the [[greek]] word more accurately, [[passions]]. some say that even the [[wise]] [[man]] is [[subject]] to these perturbations, though moderated and controlled by [[reason]], which imposes laws [[law]] upon them, and so restrains them within necessary bounds. this is the [[opinion]] of the platonists and aristotelians; for [[aristotle]] was plato's disciple, and the founder of the peripatetic school. but others, as the stoics, are of [[opinion]] that the [[wise]] [[man]] is not [[subject]] to these perturbations. but cicero, in his [[book]] de finibus, shows that the stoics are here at variance with the platonists and peripatetics rather in words than in reality; for the stoics decline to apply the term "goods" to external and bodily advantages,[332] because they reckon that the only [[good]] is [[virtue]], the art [[arts]] of living well, and this exists only in the [[mind]]. the other [[philosophers]], again, use the simple and customary phraseology, and do not scruple to call these things goods [[good]], though in comparison of [[virtue]], which guides our [[life]], they are little and of small esteem. and thus it is obvious that, whether these outward things are called goods [[good]] or advantages, they are held in the same estimation by both parties, and that in this matter the stoics are pleasing themselves merely with a novel phraseology. it seems, then, to me that in this [[question]], whether the [[wise]] [[man]] is [[subject]] to mental [[passions]], or wholly [[free]] from them, the controversy is one of words rather than of things; for i [[think]] that, if the reality and not the mere sound of the words is considered, the stoics hold precisely the same [[opinion]] as the platonists and peripatetics. for, omitting for brevity's sake other proofs which i might adduce in support of this [[opinion]], i will [[state]] but one which i consider conclusive. aulus gellius, a [[man]] of extensive erudition, and gifted with an eloquent and graceful style, relates, in his [[work]] entitled noctes atticæ,[333] that he once made a [[voyage]] with an eminent stoic philosopher; and he goes on to relate fully and with gusto what i shall barely [[state]], that when the ship was tossed and in danger from a [[violent]] storm, the philosopher[pg 357] grew pale with terror. this was noticed by those on board, who, though themselves threatened with [[death]], were [[curious]] to see whether a philosopher would be agitated like other [[men]]. when the tempest had passed over, and as soon as their security gave them [[freedom]] to resume their talk, one of the passengers, a [[rich]] and luxurious asiatic, begins to banter the philosopher, and rally him because he had even become pale with [[fear]], while he himself had been unmoved by the impending destruction. but the philosopher availed himself of the reply of aristippus the socratic, who, on finding himself similarly bantered by a [[man]] of the same [[character]], answered, "you had no cause for [[anxiety]] for the [[soul]] of a profligate debauchee, but i had [[reason]] to be alarmed for the [[soul]] of aristippus." the [[rich]] [[man]] being thus disposed of, aulus gellius [[asked]] the philosopher, in the interests of [[science]] and not to annoy him, what was the [[reason]] of his [[fear]]? and he, willing to instruct a [[man]] so zealous in the pursuit of [[knowledge]], at once took from his wallet a [[book]] of epictetus the stoic,[334] in which doctrines were advanced which precisely harmonized with those of zeno and chrysippus, the founders of the stoical school. aulus gellius says that he [[read]] in this [[book]] that the stoics maintain that there are [[certain]] impressions made on the [[soul]] by external objects which they call phantasiæ, and that it is not in the [[power]] of the [[soul]] to determine whether or when it shall be invaded by these. when these impressions are made by alarming and formidable objects, it must needs be that they move the [[soul]] even of the [[wise]] [[man]], so that for a little he trembles with [[fear]], or is depressed by sadness, these impressions anticipating the [[work]] of [[reason]] and self-control; but this does not imply that the [[mind]] accepts these [[evil]] impressions, or approves or consents to them. for this [[consent]] is, they [[think]], in a man's [[man]] [[power]]; there being this difference between the [[mind]] of the [[wise]] [[man]] and that of the [[fool]], that the fool's [[mind]] yields to these [[passions]] and consents to them, while that of the [[wise]] [[man]], though it cannot [[help]] being invaded by them, yet retains with unshaken firmness a true and steady persuasion of those things which it ought rationally to [[desire]] or avoid. this account of what[pg 358] aulus gellius relates that he [[read]] in the [[book]] of epictetus about the sentiments and doctrines of the stoics i have given as well as i could, not, perhaps, with his [[choice]] [[language]], but with greater brevity, and, i [[think]], with greater clearness. and if this be true, then there is no difference, or next to none, between the [[opinion]] of the stoics and that of the other [[philosophers]] regarding mental [[passions]] and perturbations, for both parties agree in maintaining that the [[mind]] and [[reason]] of the [[wise]] [[man]] are not [[subject]] to these. and perhaps what the stoics mean by asserting this, is that the [[wisdom]] which characterizes the [[wise]] [[man]] is clouded by no error and sullied by no taint, but, with this reservation that his [[wisdom]] remains undisturbed, he is exposed to the impressions which the goods [[good]] and ills of this [[life]] (or, as they prefer to call them, the advantages or disadvantages) make upon them. for we need not say that if that philosopher had [[thought]] nothing of those things which he [[thought]] he was forthwith to lose, [[life]] and bodily safety, he would not have been so terrified by his danger as to betray his [[fear]] by the pallor of his cheek. nevertheless, he might suffer this mental disturbance, and yet maintain the fixed persuasion that [[life]] and bodily safety, which the [[violence]] of the tempest threatened to [[destroy]], are not those [[good]] things which make their possessors [[good]], as the possession of [[righteousness]] does. but in so far as they persist that we must call them not goods [[good]] but advantages, they quarrel about words and neglect things. for what difference does it make whether goods [[good]] or advantages be the [[better]] name, while the stoic no less than the peripatetic is alarmed at the prospect of losing them, and while, though they name them differently, they hold them in like esteem? both parties assure us that, if urged to the commission of some immorality or crime by the threatened loss of these goods [[good]] or advantages, they would prefer to lose such things as preserve bodily comfort and security rather than commit such things as violate [[righteousness]]. and thus the [[mind]] in which this resolution is well grounded suffers no perturbations to prevail with it in opposition to [[reason]], even though they assail the weaker parts of the [[soul]]; and not only so, but it rules [[rule]] over them, and, while it refuses its [[consent]] and resists them, administers[pg 359] a reign of [[virtue]]. such a [[character]] is ascribed to æneas by [[virgil]] when he says,

"he stands immovable by tears, nor tenderest words with [[pity]] hears."[335]
5. that the [[passions]] which assail the souls [[soul]] of christians [[christian]] do not seduce them to [[vice]], but exercise their [[virtue]].

we need not at [[present]] give a careful and copious exposition of the doctrine of [[scripture]], the sum of [[christian]] [[knowledge]], regarding these [[passions]]. it subjects [[subject]] the [[mind]] itself to [[god]], that he may [[rule]] and aid it, and the [[passions]], again, to the [[mind]], to moderate and bridle them, and turn them to righteous uses. in our ethics, we do not so much inquire whether a pious [[soul]] is angry, as why he is angry; not whether he is [[sad]], but what is the cause of his sadness; not whether he fears [[fear]], but what he fears [[fear]]. for i am not aware that any [[right]] thinking [[person]] would find [[fault]] with anger at a wrongdoer which seeks his amendment, or with sadness which intends relief to the suffering, or with [[fear]] lest one in danger be destroyed. the stoics, indeed, are accustomed to condemn compassion.[336] but how much more honourable had it been in that stoic we have been telling of, had he been disturbed by compassion prompting him to relieve a fellow-creature, than to be disturbed by the [[fear]] of shipwreck! far [[better]], and more humane, and more consonant with pious sentiments, are the words of cicero in [[praise]] of cæsar, when he says, "among your virtues [[virtue]] none is more admirable and agreeable than your compassion."[337] and what is compassion but a fellow-feeling for another's misery, which prompts us to [[help]] him if we can? and this emotion is [[obedient]] to [[reason]], when compassion is shown without violating [[right]], as when the [[poor]] are relieved, or the penitent forgiven. cicero, who knew how to use [[language]], did not hesitate to call this a [[virtue]], which the stoics are not ashamed to reckon among the vices [[vice]], although, as the [[book]] of that eminent stoic, epictetus, quoting the opinions [[opinion]] of zeno and chrysippus, the founders of the school, has taught us, they admit that [[passions]] of this [[kind]] invade the [[soul]] of the [[wise]] [[man]], whom they would have to be [[free]] from all [[vice]].[pg 360] whence it follows that these very [[passions]] are not judged by them to be vices [[vice]], since they assail the [[wise]] [[man]] without forcing him to act against [[reason]] and [[virtue]]; and that, therefore, the [[opinion]] of the peripatetics or platonists and of the stoics is one and the same. but, as cicero says,[338] mere logomachy is the bane of these pitiful greeks [[greek]], who thirst for contention rather than for [[truth]]. however, it may justly be [[asked]], whether our subjection to these affections, even while we [[follow]] [[virtue]], is a part of the infirmity of this [[life]]? for the holy angels [[feel]] no anger while they punish those whom the eternal [[law]] of [[god]] consigns to [[punishment]], no fellow-feeling with misery while they relieve the miserable, no [[fear]] while they aid those who are in danger; and yet ordinary [[language]] ascribes to them also these mental emotions, because, though they have none of our weakness, their acts resemble the actions to which these emotions move us; and thus even [[god]] himself is said in [[scripture]] to be angry, and yet without any perturbation. for this word is used of the effect of his vengeance, not of the disturbing mental affection.

6. of the [[passions]] which, according to apuleius, agitate the demons who are supposed by him to mediate between gods and [[men]].

deferring for the [[present]] the [[question]] about the holy angels, let us examine the [[opinion]] of the platonists, that the demons who mediate between gods and [[men]] are agitated by [[passions]]. for if their [[mind]], though exposed to their incursion, still remained [[free]] and superior to them, apuleius could not have said that their hearts [[heart]] are tossed with [[passions]] as the sea by stormy winds.[339] their [[mind]], then,—that superior part of their [[soul]] whereby they are [[rational]] beings, and which, if it actually exists in them, should [[rule]] and bridle the turbulent [[passions]] of the inferior parts of the [[soul]],—this [[mind]] of theirs, i say, is, according to the platonist referred to, tossed with a hurricane of [[passions]]. the [[mind]] of the demons, therefore, is [[subject]] to the emotions of [[fear]], anger, [[lust]], and all similar affections. what part of them, then, is [[free]], and endued with [[wisdom]], so that they are pleasing to the gods, and the fit guides of [[men]] into purity of [[life]], since their very highest part, being the [[slave]] of passion and [[subject]] to [[vice]], only makes them more[pg 361] intent on deceiving and seducing, in proportion to the mental [[force]] and energy of [[desire]] they possess?

7. that the platonists maintain that the poets [[wrong]] the gods by representing them as distracted by party feeling, to which the demons, and not the gods, are [[subject]].

but if any one says that it is not of all the demons, but only of the wicked, that the poets, not without [[truth]], say that they violently [[love]] or hate [[certain]] [[men]],—for it was of them apuleius said that they were driven about by [[strong]] currents of emotion,—how can we accept this interpretation, when apuleius, in the very same connection, represents all the demons, and not only the wicked, as intermediate between gods and [[men]] by their aerial bodies [[body]]? the fiction of the poets, according to him, consists in their making gods of demons, and giving them the names of gods, and assigning them as allies or enemies [[enemy]] to [[individual]] [[men]], using this poetical licence, though they profess that the gods are very different in [[character]] from the demons, and far exalted above them by their celestial abode and [[wealth]] of beatitude. this, i say, is the poets' fiction, to say that these are gods who are not gods, and that, under the names of gods, they [[fight]] among themselves about the [[men]] whom they [[love]] or hate with keen partisan feeling. apuleius says that this is not far from the [[truth]], since, though they are wrongfully called by the names of the gods, they are described in their own proper [[character]] as demons. to this category, he says, belongs the minerva of [[homer]], "who interposed in the ranks of the greeks [[greek]] to restrain achilles."[340] for that this was minerva he supposes to be poetical fiction; for he thinks [[think]] that minerva is a [[goddess]], and he places her among the gods whom he believes [[belief]] to be all [[good]] and blessed in the sublime ethereal region, remote from intercourse with [[men]]. but that there was a demon favourable to the greeks [[greek]] and adverse to the trojans, as another, whom the same poet mentions under the name of [[venus]] or [[mars]] (gods exalted above earthly affairs in their heavenly habitations), was the trojans' ally and the foe of the greeks [[greek]], and that these demons fought for those they loved against those they hated,—in all this he owned that the poets stated something[pg 362] very like the [[truth]]. for they made these statements about beings to whom he ascribes the same [[violent]] and tempestuous [[passions]] as disturb [[men]], and who are therefore capable of loves [[love]] and hatreds not justly formed, but formed in a party spirit, as the spectators in races [[race]] or hunts take fancies and prejudices. it seems to have been the [[great]] [[fear]] of this platonist that the poetical fictions should be believed of the gods, and not of the demons who bore their names.

8. how apuleius defines the gods who dwell in [[heaven]], the demons who occupy the air, and [[men]] who inhabit [[earth]].

the definition which apuleius gives of demons, and in which he of course includes all demons, is that they are in [[nature]] animals, in [[soul]] [[subject]] to passion, in [[mind]] reasonable, in [[body]] aerial, in duration eternal. now in these five qualities he has named absolutely nothing which is proper to [[good]] [[men]] and not also to [[bad]]. for when apuleius had spoken of the celestials first, and had then extended his description so as to include an account of those who dwell far below on the [[earth]], that, after describing the two extremes of [[rational]] being, he might proceed to speak of the intermediate demons, he says, "men, therefore, who are endowed with the faculty of [[reason]] and [[speech]], whose [[soul]] is [[immortal]] and their members mortal, who have [[weak]] and anxious spirits, dull and corruptible bodies [[body]], dissimilar characters [[character]], similar ignorance, who are obstinate in their audacity, and persistent in their [[hope]], whose [[labour]] is [[vain]], and whose [[fortune]] is ever on the wane, their [[race]] [[immortal]], themselves perishing, each [[generation]] replenished with creatures whose [[life]] is swift and their [[wisdom]] slow, their [[death]] sudden and their [[life]] a wail,—these are the [[men]] who dwell on the [[earth]]."[341] in recounting so many qualities which belong to the large proportion of [[men]], did he forget that which is the [[property]] of the few when he speaks of their [[wisdom]] being slow? if this had been omitted, this his description of the [[human]] [[race]], so carefully elaborated, would have been defective. and when he commended the excellence of the gods, he affirmed that they excelled in that very blessedness to which he thinks [[think]] [[men]] must attain by [[wisdom]]. and therefore, if he had wished us to [[believe]] that some of the demons[pg 363] are [[good]], he should have inserted in his description something by which we might see that they have, in [[common]] with the gods, some share of blessedness, or, in [[common]] with [[men]], some [[wisdom]]. but, as it is, he has mentioned no [[good]] quality by which the [[good]] may be distinguished from the [[bad]]. for although he refrained from giving a full account of their wickedness, through [[fear]] of offending, not themselves but their worshippers, for whom he was writing, yet he sufficiently indicated to discerning readers what [[opinion]] he had of them; for only in the one article of the eternity of their bodies [[body]] does he assimilate them to the gods, all of whom, he asserts, are [[good]] and blessed, and absolutely [[free]] from what he himself calls the stormy [[passions]] of the demons; and as to the [[soul]], he quite plainly affirms that they resemble [[men]] and not the gods, and that this resemblance lies [[lie]] not in the possession of [[wisdom]], which even [[men]] can attain to, but in the perturbation of [[passions]] which sway the foolish and wicked, but is so ruled by the [[good]] and [[wise]] that they prefer not to admit rather than to conquer it. for if he had wished it to be understood that the demons resembled the gods in the eternity not of their bodies [[body]] but of their souls [[soul]], he would certainly have admitted [[men]] to share in this [[privilege]], because, as a platonist, he of course must hold that the [[human]] [[soul]] is eternal. accordingly, when describing this [[race]] of living beings, he said that their souls [[soul]] were [[immortal]], their members mortal. and, consequently, if [[men]] have not eternity in [[common]] with the gods because they have mortal bodies [[body]], demons have eternity in [[common]] with the gods because their bodies [[body]] are [[immortal]].

9. whether the intercession of the demons can secure for [[men]] the [[friendship]] of the celestial gods.

how, then, can [[men]] [[hope]] for a favourable introduction to the [[friendship]] of the gods by such mediators as these, who are, like [[men]], defective in that which is the [[better]] part of every living creature, viz. the [[soul]], and who resemble the gods only in the [[body]], which is the inferior part? for a living creature or animal consists of [[soul]] and [[body]], and of these two parts the [[soul]] is undoubtedly the [[better]]; even though vicious and [[weak]], it is obviously [[better]] than even the soundest and strongest [[body]], for the greater excellence of its [[nature]] is not[pg 364] reduced to the level of the [[body]] even by the pollution of [[vice]], as gold, even when tarnished, is more precious than the purest silver or lead. and yet these mediators, by whose interposition things [[human]] and [[divine]] are to be harmonized, have an eternal [[body]] in [[common]] with the gods, and a vicious [[soul]] in [[common]] with [[men]],—as if the [[religion]] by which these demons are to unite gods and [[men]] were a bodily, and not a [[spiritual]] matter. what wickedness, then, or [[punishment]] has suspended these false and deceitful mediators, as it were head downwards, so that their inferior part, their [[body]], is linked to the gods above, and their superior part, the [[soul]], bound to [[men]] beneath; [[united]] to the celestial gods by the part that serves, and miserable, together with the inhabitants of [[earth]], by the part that rules [[rule]]? for the [[body]] is the servant, as sallust says: "we use the [[soul]] to [[rule]], the [[body]] to obey;"[342] adding, "the one we have in [[common]] with the gods, the other with the brutes." for he was here speaking of [[men]]; and they have, like the brutes, a mortal [[body]]. these demons, whom our philosophic [[friends]] have provided for us as mediators with the gods, may indeed say of the [[soul]] and [[body]], the one we have in [[common]] with the gods, the other with [[men]]; but, as i said, they are as it were suspended and bound head downwards, having the [[slave]], the [[body]], in [[common]] with the gods, the master, the [[soul]], in [[common]] with miserable [[men]],—their inferior part exalted, their superior part depressed. and therefore, if any one supposes that, because they are not [[subject]], like terrestrial animals, to the separation of [[soul]] and [[body]] by [[death]], they therefore resemble the gods in their eternity, their [[body]] must not be considered a chariot of an eternal triumph, but rather the chain of an eternal [[punishment]].

10. that, according to plotinus, [[men]], whose [[body]] is mortal, are less wretched than demons, whose [[body]] is eternal.

plotinus, whose memory is quite recent,[343] enjoys the [[reputation]] of having understood [[plato]] [[better]] than any other of his disciples. in speaking of [[human]] souls [[soul]], he says, "the [[father]] in compassion made their bonds mortal;"[344] that is to say, he[pg 365] considered it due to the father's [[mercy]] that [[men]], having a mortal [[body]], should not be for ever confined in the misery of this [[life]]. but of this [[mercy]] the demons have been judged unworthy, and they have received, in conjunction with a [[soul]] [[subject]] to [[passions]], a [[body]] not mortal like man's [[man]], but eternal. for they should have been happier than [[men]] if they had, like [[men]], had a mortal [[body]], and, like the gods, a blessed [[soul]]. and they should have been [[equal]] to [[men]], if in conjunction with a miserable [[soul]] they had at least received, like [[men]], a mortal [[body]], so that [[death]] might have freed them from trouble, if, at least, they should have attained some [[degree]] of piety. but, as it is, they are not only no happier than [[men]], having, like them, a miserable [[soul]], they are also more wretched, being eternally bound to the [[body]]; for he does not leave us to infer that by some [[progress]] in [[wisdom]] and piety they can become gods, but expressly says that they are demons for ever.

11. of the [[opinion]] of the platonists, that the souls [[soul]] of [[men]] become demons when disembodied.

he[345] says, indeed, that the souls [[soul]] of [[men]] are demons, and that [[men]] become lares if they are [[good]], lemures or larvæ if they are [[bad]], and manes if it is uncertain whether they deserve well or ill. who does not see at a glance that this is a mere whirlpool sucking [[men]] to [[moral]] destruction? for, however wicked [[men]] have been, if they suppose they shall become larvæ or [[divine]] manes, they will become the worse the more [[love]] they have for inflicting injury; for, as the larvæ are hurtful demons made out of wicked [[men]], these [[men]] must suppose that after [[death]] they will be invoked with sacrifices [[sacrifice]] and [[divine]] honours [[honour]] that they may inflict injuries. but this [[question]] we must not pursue. he also states that the blessed are called in [[greek]] εὐδαίμονες, because they are [[good]] souls [[soul]], that is to say, [[good]] demons, confirming his [[opinion]] that the souls [[soul]] of [[men]] are demons.

12. of the three opposite qualities by which the platonists distinguish between the [[nature]] of [[men]] and that of demons.

but at [[present]] we are speaking of those beings whom he described as being properly intermediate between gods and [[men]], in [[nature]] animals, in [[mind]] [[rational]], in [[soul]] [[subject]] to[pg 366] passion, in [[body]] aerial, in duration eternal. when he had distinguished the gods, whom he placed in the highest [[heaven]], from [[men]], whom he placed on [[earth]], not only by position but also by the unequal [[dignity]] of their natures [[nature]], he concluded in these words: "you have here two kinds [[kind]] of animals: the gods, widely distinguished from [[men]] by sublimity of abode, perpetuity of [[life]], [[perfection]] of [[nature]]; for their habitations are separated by so wide an interval that there can be no intimate communication between them, and while the vitality of the one is eternal and indefeasible, that of the others is fading and precarious, and while the spirits of the gods are exalted in bliss, those of [[men]] are sunk in miseries."[346] here i find three opposite qualities ascribed to the extremes of being, the highest and lowest. for, after mentioning the three qualities for which we are to [[admire]] the gods, he repeated, though in other words, the same three as a foil to the defects of [[man]]. the three qualities are, "sublimity of abode, perpetuity of [[life]], [[perfection]] of [[nature]]." these he again mentioned so as to bring out their contrasts in man's [[man]] condition. as he had mentioned "sublimity of abode," he says, "their habitations are separated by so wide an interval;" as he had mentioned "perpetuity of [[life]]," he says, that "while [[divine]] [[life]] is eternal and indefeasible, [[human]] [[life]] is fading and precarious;" and as he had mentioned "perfection of [[nature]]," he says, that "while the spirits of the gods are exalted in bliss, those of [[men]] are sunk in miseries." these three things, then, he predicates of the gods, exaltation, eternity, blessedness; and of [[man]] he predicates the opposite, lowliness of habitation, [[mortality]], misery.

13. how the demons can mediate between gods and [[men]] if they have nothing in [[common]] with both, being neither blessed like the gods, nor miserable like [[men]].

if, now, we endeavour to find between these opposites the mean occupied by the demons, there can be no [[question]] as to their local position; for, between the highest and lowest place, there is a place which is rightly considered and called the middle place. the other two qualities remain, and to them we must give greater [[care]], that we may see whether they are[pg 367] altogether [[foreign]] to the demons, or how they are so bestowed upon them without infringing upon their mediate position. we may dismiss the [[idea]] that they are [[foreign]] to them. for we cannot say that the demons, being [[rational]] animals, are neither blessed nor wretched, as we say of the beasts and plants, which are void of feeling and [[reason]], or as we say of the middle place, that it is neither the highest nor the lowest. the demons, being [[rational]], must be either miserable or blessed. and, in like manner, we cannot say that they are neither mortal nor [[immortal]]; for all living things either [[live]] eternally or end [[life]] in [[death]]. our author, besides, stated that the demons are eternal. what remains for us to suppose, then, but that these mediate beings are assimilated to the gods in one of the two remaining qualities, and to [[men]] in the other? for if they received both from above, or both from beneath, they should no longer be mediate, but either rise to the gods above, or sink to [[men]] beneath. therefore, as it has been demonstrated that they must possess these two qualities, they will hold their middle place if they receive one from each party. consequently, as they cannot receive their eternity from beneath, because it is not there to receive, they must get it from above; and accordingly they have no [[choice]] but to complete their mediate position by accepting misery from [[men]].

according to the platonists, then, the gods, who occupy the highest place, enjoy eternal blessedness, or blessed eternity; [[men]], who occupy the lowest, a mortal misery, or a miserable [[mortality]]; and the demons, who occupy the mean, a miserable eternity, or an eternal misery. as to those five things which apuleius included in his definition of demons, he did not show, as he promised, that the demons are mediate. for three of them, that their [[nature]] is animal, their [[mind]] [[rational]], their [[soul]] [[subject]] to [[passions]], he said that they have in [[common]] with [[men]]; one thing, their eternity, in [[common]] with the gods; and one proper to themselves, their aerial [[body]]. how, then, are they intermediate, when they have three things in [[common]] with the lowest, and only one in [[common]] with the highest? who does not see that the intermediate position is abandoned in proportion as they tend to, and are depressed towards, the lowest extreme? but perhaps we are to accept them as[pg 368] intermediate because of their one [[property]] of an aerial [[body]], as the two extremes have each their proper [[body]], the gods an ethereal, [[men]] a terrestrial [[body]], and because two of the qualities they possess in [[common]] with [[man]] they possess also in [[common]] with the gods, namely, their animal [[nature]] and [[rational]] [[mind]]. for apuleius himself, in speaking of gods and [[men]], said, "you have two animal natures [[nature]]." and platonists are wont to ascribe a [[rational]] [[mind]] to the gods. two qualities remain, their liability to passion, and their eternity,—the first of which they have in [[common]] with [[men]], the second with the gods; so that they are neither wafted to the highest nor depressed to the lowest extreme, but perfectly poised in their intermediate position. but then, this is the very circumstance which constitutes the eternal misery, or miserable eternity, of the demons. for he who says that their [[soul]] is [[subject]] to [[passions]] would also have said that they are miserable, had he not blushed for their worshippers. moreover, as the [[world]] is governed, not by fortuitous haphazard, but, as the platonists themselves avow, by the providence of the supreme [[god]], the misery of the demons would not be eternal unless their wickedness were [[great]].

if, then, the blessed are rightly styled eudemons, the demons intermediate between gods and [[men]] are not eudemons. what, then, is the local position of those [[good]] demons, who, above [[men]] but beneath the gods, afford assistance to the former, minister to the latter? for if they are [[good]] and eternal, they are doubtless blessed. but eternal blessedness destroys their intermediate [[character]], giving them a close resemblance to the gods, and widely separating them from [[men]]. and therefore the platonists will in [[vain]] strive to show how the [[good]] demons, if they are both [[immortal]] and blessed, can justly be said to hold a middle place between the gods, who are [[immortal]] and blessed, and [[men]], who are mortal and miserable. for if they have both immortality and blessedness in [[common]] with the gods, and neither of these in [[common]] with [[men]], who are both miserable and mortal, are they not rather remote from [[men]] and [[united]] with the gods, than intermediate between them? they would be intermediate if they held one of their qualities in [[common]] with the one party, and the other with[pg 369] the other, as [[man]] is a [[kind]] of mean between angels and beasts,—the beast being an irrational and mortal animal, the angel a [[rational]] and [[immortal]] one, while [[man]], inferior to the angel and superior to the beast, and having in [[common]] with the one [[mortality]], and with the other [[reason]], is a [[rational]] and mortal animal. so, when we seek for an intermediate between the blessed immortals [[immortal]] and miserable mortals, we should find a being which is either mortal and blessed, or [[immortal]] and miserable.

14. whether [[men]], though mortal, can enjoy true blessedness.

it is a [[great]] [[question]] among [[men]], whether [[man]] can be mortal and blessed. some, taking the humbler view of his condition, have denied that he is capable of blessedness so long as he continues in this mortal [[life]]; others, again, have spurned this [[idea]], and have been bold enough to maintain that, even though mortal, [[men]] may be blessed by attaining [[wisdom]]. but if this be the case, why are not these [[wise]] [[men]] constituted mediators between miserable mortals and the blessed immortals [[immortal]], since they have blessedness in [[common]] with the latter, and [[mortality]] in [[common]] with the former? certainly, if they are blessed, they envy no one (for what more miserable than envy?), but seek with all their might to [[help]] miserable mortals on to blessedness, so that after [[death]] they may become [[immortal]], and be associated with the blessed and [[immortal]] angels.

15. of the [[man]] [[christ]] [[jesus]], the mediator between [[god]] and [[men]].

but if, as is much more probable and credible, it must needs be that all [[men]], so long as they are mortal, are also miserable, we must seek an intermediate who is not only [[man]], but also [[god]], that, by the interposition of his blessed [[mortality]], he may bring [[men]] out of their mortal misery to a blessed immortality. in this intermediate two things are requisite, that he become mortal, and that he do not continue mortal. he did become mortal, not rendering the divinity of the word infirm, but assuming the infirmity of flesh. neither did he continue mortal in the flesh, but raised it from the [[dead]]; for it is the very fruit of his mediation that those, for the sake of whose redemption he became the mediator,[pg 370] should not abide eternally in bodily [[death]]. wherefore it became the mediator between us and [[god]] to have both a transient [[mortality]] and a permanent blessedness, that by that which is transient he might be assimilated to mortals, and might translate them from [[mortality]] to that which is permanent. [[good]] angels, therefore, cannot mediate between miserable mortals and blessed immortals [[immortal]], for they themselves also are both blessed and [[immortal]]; but [[evil]] angels can mediate, because they are [[immortal]] like the one party, miserable like the other. to these is opposed the [[good]] mediator, who, in opposition to their immortality and misery, has chosen to be mortal for a [[time]], and has been able to continue blessed in eternity. it is thus he has destroyed, by the [[humility]] of his [[death]] and the benignity of his blessedness, those proud immortals [[immortal]] and hurtful wretches, and has prevented them from seducing to misery by their boast of immortality those [[men]] whose hearts [[heart]] he has cleansed by [[faith]], and whom he has thus freed from their impure dominion.

man, then, mortal and miserable, and far removed from the [[immortal]] and the blessed, what medium shall he choose by which he may be [[united]] to immortality and blessedness? the immortality of the demons, which might have some charm for [[man]], is miserable; the [[mortality]] of [[christ]], which might offend [[man]], exists no longer. in the one there is the [[fear]] of an eternal misery; in the other, [[death]], which could not be eternal, can no longer be feared, and blessedness, which is eternal, must be loved. for the [[immortal]] and miserable mediator interposes himself to prevent us from passing to a blessed immortality, because that which hinders such a passage, namely, misery, continues in him; but the mortal and blessed mediator interposed himself, in order that, having passed through [[mortality]], he might of mortals make immortals [[immortal]] (showing his [[power]] to do this in his own resurrection), and from being miserable to raise them to the blessed company from the number of whom he had himself never departed. there is, then, a wicked mediator, who separates [[friends]], and a [[good]] mediator, who reconciles enemies [[enemy]]. and those who separate are numerous, because the multitude of the blessed are blessed only by their participation in the one [[god]]; of which[pg 371] participation the [[evil]] angels being deprived, they are wretched, and interpose to hinder rather than to [[help]] to this blessedness, and by their very number prevent us from reaching that one beatific [[good]], to obtain which we need not many but one mediator, the uncreated word of [[god]], by whom all things were made, and in partaking of whom we are blessed. i do not say that he is mediator because he is the word, for as the word he is supremely blessed and supremely [[immortal]], and therefore far from miserable mortals; but he is mediator as he is [[man]], for by his [[humanity]] he shows us that, in order to obtain that blessed and beatific [[good]], we need not seek other mediators to lead us through the successive steps of this attainment, but that the blessed and beatific [[god]], having himself become a partaker of our [[humanity]], has afforded us ready access to the participation of his divinity. for in delivering us from our [[mortality]] and misery, he does not lead us to the [[immortal]] and blessed angels, so that we should become [[immortal]] and blessed by participating in their [[nature]], but he leads us straight to that trinity, by participating in which the angels themselves are blessed. therefore, when he chose to be in the form of a servant, and lower than the angels, that he might be our mediator, he remained higher than the angels, in the form of [[god]],—himself at once the way of [[life]] on [[earth]] and [[life]] itself in [[heaven]].

16. whether it is reasonable in the platonists to determine that the celestial gods decline contact with earthly things and intercourse with [[men]], who therefore require the intercession of the demons.

that [[opinion]], which the same platonist avers that [[plato]] uttered, is not true, "that no [[god]] holds intercourse with [[men]]."[347] and this, he says, is the [[chief]] evidence of their exaltation, that they are never contaminated by contact with [[men]]. he admits, therefore, that the demons are contaminated; and it follows that they cannot cleanse those by whom they are themselves contaminated, and thus all alike become impure, the demons by associating with [[men]], and [[men]] by worshipping the demons. or, if they say that the demons are not contaminated by associating and dealing with [[men]], then they are [[better]] than the gods, for the gods, were they to do so, would be contaminated.[pg 372] for this, we are told, is the [[glory]] of the gods, that they are so highly exalted that no [[human]] intercourse can sully them. he affirms, indeed, that the supreme [[god]], the creator of all things, whom we call the true [[god]], is spoken of by [[plato]] as the only [[god]] whom the [[poverty]] of [[human]] [[speech]] fails even passably to describe; and that even the [[wise]], when their mental energy is as far as possible delivered from the trammels of connection with the [[body]], have only such gleams of insight into his [[nature]] as may be compared to a flash of lightning illumining the darkness. if, then, this supreme [[god]], who is truly exalted above all things, does nevertheless visit the minds [[mind]] of the [[wise]], when emancipated from the [[body]], with an intelligible and ineffable presence, though this be only occasional, and as it were a swift flash of [[light]] athwart the darkness, why are the other gods so sublimely removed from all contact with [[men]], as if they would be polluted by it? as if it were not a sufficient refutation of this to lift up our [[eyes]] to those heavenly bodies [[body]] which give the [[earth]] its needful [[light]]. if the stars, though they, by his account, are visible gods, are not contaminated when we look at them, neither are the demons contaminated when [[men]] see them quite closely. but perhaps it is the [[human]] voice, and not the eye, which pollutes the gods; and therefore the demons are appointed to mediate and carry men's utterances to the gods, who keep themselves remote through [[fear]] of pollution? what am i to say of the other senses? for by smell neither the demons, who are [[present]], nor the gods, though they were [[present]] and inhaling the exhalations of living [[men]], would be polluted if they are not contaminated with the effluvia of the carcases offered in [[sacrifice]]. as for taste, they are pressed by no necessity of repairing bodily decay, so as to be reduced to ask food from [[men]]. and touch is in their own [[power]]. for while it may seem that contact is so called, because the sense of touch is specially concerned in it, yet the gods, if so minded, might mingle with [[men]], so as to see and be seen, hear and be heard; and where is the need of touching? for [[men]] would not dare to [[desire]] this, if they were favoured with the sight or conversation of gods or [[good]] demons; and if through excessive curiosity they should [[desire]] it, how could they accomplish their [[wish]] without[pg 373] the [[consent]] of the [[god]] or demon, when they cannot touch so much as a sparrow unless it be caged?

there is, then, nothing to hinder the gods from mingling in a bodily form with [[men]], from seeing and being seen, from speaking and hearing. and if the demons do thus mix with [[men]], as i said, and are not polluted, while the gods, were they to do so, should be polluted, then the demons are less liable to pollution than the gods. and if even the demons are contaminated, how can they [[help]] [[men]] to attain blessedness after [[death]], if, so far from being able to cleanse them, and [[present]] them clean to the unpolluted gods, these mediators are themselves polluted? and if they cannot confer this benefit on [[men]], what [[good]] can their friendly mediation do? or shall its result be, not that [[men]] find entrance to the gods, but that [[men]] and demons abide together in a [[state]] of pollution, and consequently of exclusion from blessedness? unless, perhaps, some one may say that, like sponges or things of that sort, the demons themselves, in the process of cleansing their [[friends]], become themselves the filthier in proportion as the others become clean. but if this is the solution, then the gods, who shun contact or intercourse with [[men]] for [[fear]] of pollution, mix with demons who are far more polluted. or perhaps the gods, who cannot cleanse [[men]] without polluting themselves, can without pollution cleanse the demons who have been contaminated by [[human]] contact? who can [[believe]] such follies, unless the demons have practised their deceit upon him? if seeing and being seen is contamination, and if the gods, whom apuleius himself calls visible, "the brilliant lights [[light]] of the [[world]],"[348] and the other stars, are seen by [[men]], are we to [[believe]] that the demons, who cannot be seen unless they please, are safer from contamination? or if it is only the seeing and not the being seen which contaminates, then they must deny that these gods of theirs, these brilliant lights [[light]] of the [[world]], see [[men]] when their rays beam upon the [[earth]]. their rays are not contaminated by lighting on all manner of pollution, and are we to suppose that the gods would be contaminated if they mixed with [[men]], and even if contact were needed in order to assist them? for there is contact between the earth[pg 374] and the sun's or moon's rays, and yet this does not pollute the [[light]].

17. that to obtain the blessed [[life]], which consists in partaking of the supreme [[good]], [[man]] needs such mediation as is furnished not by a demon, but by [[christ]] alone.

i am considerably surprised that such learned [[men]], [[men]] who pronounce all material and sensible things to be altogether inferior to those that are [[spiritual]] and intelligible, should mention bodily contact in connection with the blessed [[life]]. is that sentiment of plotinus forgotten?—"we must fly to our beloved fatherland. there is the [[father]], there our all. what fleet or flight shall convey us thither? our way is, to become like [[god]]."[349] if, then, one is nearer to [[god]] the liker he is to him, there is no other distance from [[god]] than unlikeness to him. and the [[soul]] of [[man]] is unlike that incorporeal and unchangeable and eternal essence, in proportion as it craves things temporal and mutable. and as the things beneath, which are mortal and impure, cannot hold intercourse with the [[immortal]] purity which is above, a mediator is indeed needed to remove this difficulty; but not a mediator who resembles the highest order of being by possessing an [[immortal]] [[body]], and the lowest by having a diseased [[soul]], which makes him rather grudge that we be healed than [[help]] our cure. we need a mediator who, being [[united]] to us here below by the [[mortality]] of his [[body]], should at the same [[time]] be able to afford us truly [[divine]] [[help]] in cleansing and liberating us by means of the [[immortal]] [[righteousness]] of his spirit, whereby he remained heavenly even while here upon [[earth]]. far be it from the incontaminable [[god]] to [[fear]] pollution from the man[350] he assumed, or from the [[men]] among whom he lived in the form of a [[man]]. for, though his incarnation showed us nothing else, these two wholesome facts [[fact]] were enough, that true divinity cannot be polluted by flesh, and that demons are not to be considered [[better]] than ourselves because they have not flesh.[351] this, then, as [[scripture]] says, is the "mediator between [[god]] and [[man]], the [[man]] [[christ]] [[jesus]],"[352] of whose divinity,[pg 375] whereby he is [[equal]] to the [[father]], and [[humanity]], whereby he has become like us, this is not the place to speak as fully as i could.

18. that the deceitful demons, while promising to conduct [[men]] to [[god]] by their intercession, mean to turn them from the path of [[truth]].

as to the demons, these false and deceitful mediators, who, though their uncleanness of spirit frequently reveals their misery and malignity, yet, by [[virtue]] of the levity of their aerial bodies [[body]] and the [[nature]] of the places they inhabit, do contrive to turn us aside and hinder our [[spiritual]] [[progress]]; they do not [[help]] us towards [[god]], but rather prevent us from reaching him. since even in the bodily way, which is erroneous and misleading, and in which [[righteousness]] does not walk,—for we must rise to [[god]] not by bodily ascent, but by incorporeal or [[spiritual]] conformity to him,—in this bodily way, i say, which the [[friends]] of the demons arrange according to the weight of the various elements, the aerial demons being set between the ethereal gods and earthy [[men]], they imagine the gods to have this [[privilege]], that by this local interval they are preserved from the pollution of [[human]] contact. thus they [[believe]] that the demons are contaminated by [[men]] rather than [[men]] cleansed by the demons, and that the gods themselves should be polluted unless their local superiority preserved them. who is so wretched a creature as to expect purification by a way in which [[men]] are contaminating, demons contaminated, and gods contaminable? who would not rather choose that way whereby we escape the contamination of the demons, and are cleansed from pollution by the incontaminable [[god]], so as to be associated with the uncontaminated angels?

19. that even among their own worshippers the name "demon" has never a [[good]] signification.

but as some of these demonolators, as i may call them, and among them labeo, allege that those whom they call demons are by others called angels, i must, if i would not seem to dispute merely about words, say something about the [[good]] angels. the platonists do not deny their existence, but prefer to call them [[good]] demons. but we, following [[scripture]], according to which we are christians [[christian]], have learned that some of the angels are [[good]], some [[bad]], but never have we [[read]] in[pg 376] [[scripture]] of [[good]] demons; but wherever this or any cognate term occurs, it is applied only to wicked spirits. and this usage has become so universal, that, even among those who are called pagans, and who maintain that demons as well as gods should be worshipped, there is scarcely a [[man]], no matter how well [[read]] and learned, who would dare to say by way of [[praise]] to his [[slave]], you have a demon, or who could [[doubt]] that the [[man]] to whom he said this would consider it a curse? why, then, are we to [[subject]] ourselves to the necessity of explaining away what we have said when we have given offence by using the word demon, with which every one, or almost every one, connects a [[bad]] meaning, while we can so easily evade this necessity by using the word angel?

20. of the [[kind]] of [[knowledge]] which puffs up the demons.

however, the very origin of the name suggests something worthy of consideration, if we compare it with the [[divine]] books [[book]]. they are called demons from a [[greek]] word meaning [[knowledge]].[353] now the apostle, speaking with the holy spirit, says, "knowledge puffeth up, but charity buildeth up."[354] and this can only be understood as meaning that without charity [[knowledge]] does no [[good]], but inflates a [[man]] or magnifies him with an empty windiness. the demons, then, have [[knowledge]] without charity, and are thereby so inflated or proud, that they crave those [[divine]] honours [[honour]] and [[religious]] services which they [[know]] to be due to the true [[god]], and still, as far as they can, exact these from all over whom they have influence. against this [[pride]] of the demons, under which the [[human]] [[race]] was held [[subject]] as its merited [[punishment]], there was exerted the mighty influence of the [[humility]] of [[god]], who appeared in the form of a servant; but [[men]], resembling the demons in [[pride]], but not in [[knowledge]], and being puffed up with uncleanness, failed to recognise him.

21. to what extent the [[lord]] was pleased to make himself known to the demons.

the devils [[devil]] themselves knew this manifestation of [[god]] so well, that they said to the [[lord]], though clothed with the[pg 377] infirmity of flesh, "what have we to do with thee, [[jesus]] of nazareth? art [[arts]] thou come to [[destroy]] us before the [[time]]?"[355] from these words, it is clear that they had [[great]] [[knowledge]], and no charity. they feared his [[power]] to punish, and did not [[love]] his [[righteousness]]. he made known to them so much as he pleased, and he was pleased to make known so much as was needful. but he made himself known, not as to the holy angels, who [[know]] him as the word of [[god]], and rejoice in his eternity, which they partake, but as was requisite to strike with terror the beings from whose [[tyranny]] he was going to [[free]] those who were predestined to his [[kingdom]] and the [[glory]] of it, eternally true and truly eternal. he made himself known, therefore, to the demons, not by that which is [[life]] eternal, and the unchangeable [[light]] which illumines the pious, whose souls [[soul]] are cleansed by the [[faith]] that is in him, but by some temporal effects of his [[power]], and evidences of his mysterious presence, which were more easily discerned by the angelic senses even of wicked spirits than by [[human]] infirmity. but when he judged it advisable gradually to suppress these signs, and to retire into deeper obscurity, the [[prince]] of the demons doubted whether he were the [[christ]], and endeavoured to ascertain this by tempting him, in so far as he permitted himself to be tempted, that he might adapt the manhood he wore to be an [[example]] for our imitation. but after that temptation, when, as [[scripture]] says, he was ministered to[356] by the angels who are [[good]] and holy, and therefore objects of terror to the impure spirits, he revealed more and more distinctly to the demons how [[great]] he was, so that, even though the infirmity of his flesh might seem contemptible, none dared to resist his [[authority]].

22. the difference between the [[knowledge]] of the holy angels and that of the demons.

the [[good]] angels, therefore, hold cheap all that [[knowledge]] of material and transitory things which the demons are so proud of possessing,—not that they are ignorant of these things, but because the [[love]] of [[god]], whereby they are sanctified, is very dear to them, and because, in comparison of that not merely immaterial but also unchangeable and ineffable [[beauty]],[pg 378] with the holy [[love]] of which they are inflamed, they despise all things which are beneath it, and all that is not it, that they may with every [[good]] thing that is in them enjoy that [[good]] which is the source of their goodness. and therefore they have a more [[certain]] [[knowledge]] even of those temporal and mutable things, because they contemplate their principles [[principle]] and causes in the word of [[god]], by which the [[world]] was made,—those causes by which one thing is approved, another rejected, and all arranged. but the demons do not behold in the [[wisdom]] of [[god]] these eternal, and, as it were, cardinal causes of things temporal, but only foresee a larger part of the future than [[men]] do, by [[reason]] of their greater acquaintance with the signs which are hidden from us. sometimes, too, it is their own intentions they predict. and, finally, the demons are frequently, the angels never, deceived. for it is one thing, by the aid of things temporal and changeable, to conjecture the changes [[change]] that may occur in [[time]], and to modify such things by one's own will and faculty,—and this is to a [[certain]] extent permitted to the demons,—it is another thing to foresee the changes [[change]] of times [[time]] in the eternal and immutable laws [[law]] of [[god]], which [[live]] in his [[wisdom]], and to [[know]] the will of [[god]], the most infallible and powerful of all causes, by participating in his spirit; and this is granted to the holy angels by a just discretion. and thus they are not only eternal, but blessed and the [[good]] wherein they are blessed is [[god]], by whom they were created. for without end they enjoy the contemplation and participation of him.

23. that the name of gods is falsely given to the gods of the gentiles, though [[scripture]] applies it both to the holy angels and just [[men]].

if the platonists prefer to call these angels gods rather than demons, and to reckon them with those whom [[plato]], their founder and master, maintains were created by the supreme [[god]],[357] they are welcome to do so, for i will not spend [[strength]] in fighting about words. for if they say that these beings are [[immortal]], and yet created by the supreme [[god]], blessed but by cleaving to their creator and not by their own [[power]], they say what we say, whatever name they call these beings by. and that this is the [[opinion]] either of all or the [[best]] of[pg 379] the platonists can be ascertained by their writings. and regarding the name itself, if they see fit to call such blessed and [[immortal]] creatures gods, this need not give rise to any serious discussion between us, since in our own scriptures [[scripture]] we [[read]], "the [[god]] of gods, the [[lord]] hath spoken;"[358] and again, "confess to the [[god]] of gods;"[359] and again, "he is a [[great]] [[king]] above all gods."[360] and where it is said, "he is to be feared above all gods," the [[reason]] is forthwith added, for it follows, "for all the gods of the nations are idols, but the [[lord]] made the heavens [[heaven]]."[361] he said, "above all gods," but added, "of the nations;" that is to say, above all those whom the nations count gods, in other words, demons. by them he is to be feared with that terror in which they cried to the [[lord]], "hast thou come to [[destroy]] us?" but where it is said, "the [[god]] of gods," it cannot be understood as the [[god]] of the demons; and far be it from us to say that "great [[king]] above all gods" means "great [[king]] above all demons." but the same [[scripture]] also calls [[men]] who belong to god's [[people]] "gods:" "i have said, ye are gods, and all of you [[children]] of the most high."[362] accordingly, when [[god]] is styled [[god]] of gods, this may be understood of these gods; and so, too, when he is styled a [[great]] [[king]] above all gods.

nevertheless, some one may say, if [[men]] are called gods because they belong to god's [[people]], whom he addresses by means of [[men]] and angels, are not the immortals [[immortal]], who already enjoy that felicity which [[men]] seek to attain by worshipping [[god]], much more worthy of the title? and what shall we reply to this, if not that it is not without [[reason]] that in holy [[scripture]] [[men]] are more expressly styled gods than those [[immortal]] and blessed spirits to whom we [[hope]] to be [[equal]] in the resurrection, because there was a [[fear]] that the weakness of unbelief, being overcome with the excellence of these beings, might presume to constitute some of them a [[god]]? in the case of [[men]] this was a result that need not be guarded against. besides, it was [[right]] that the [[men]] belonging to god's [[people]] should be more expressly called gods, to assure and certify them that he who is called [[god]] of gods is their [[god]]; because,[pg 380] although those [[immortal]] and blessed spirits who dwell in the heavens [[heaven]] are called gods, yet they are not called gods of gods, that is to say, gods of the [[men]] who constitute god's [[people]], and to whom it is said, "i have said, ye are gods, and all of you the [[children]] of the most high." hence the saying of the apostle, "though there be that are called gods, whether in [[heaven]] or in [[earth]], as there be gods many and lords [[lord]] many, but to us there is but one [[god]], the [[father]], of whom are all things, and we in him; and one [[lord]] [[jesus]] [[christ]], by whom are all things, and we by him."[363]

we need not, therefore, laboriously contend about the name, since the reality is so obvious as to admit of no shadow of [[doubt]]. that which we say, that the angels who are sent to announce the will of [[god]] to [[men]] belong to the order of blessed immortals [[immortal]], does not satisfy the platonists, because they [[believe]] that this ministry is discharged, not by those whom they call gods, in other words, not by blessed immortals [[immortal]], but by demons, whom they dare not affirm to be blessed, but only [[immortal]], or if they do rank them among the blessed immortals [[immortal]], yet only as [[good]] demons, and not as gods who dwell in the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]] remote from all [[human]] contact. but, though it may seem mere wrangling about a name, yet the name of demon is so detestable that we cannot bear in any sense to apply it to the holy angels. now, therefore, let us close this [[book]] in the assurance that, whatever we call these [[immortal]] and blessed spirits, who yet are only creatures, they do not act as mediators to introduce to everlasting felicity miserable mortals, from whom they are severed by a twofold distinction. and those others who are mediators, in so far as they have immortality in [[common]] with their superiors, and misery in [[common]] with their inferiors (for they are justly miserable in [[punishment]] of their wickedness), cannot bestow upon us, but rather grudge that we should possess, the blessedness from which they themselves are excluded. and so the [[friends]] of the demons have nothing considerable to allege why we should rather [[worship]] them as our helpers than avoid them as traitors to our interests. as for those spirits who are [[good]], and who are therefore not only [[immortal]] but also blessed, and to whom[pg 381] they suppose we should give the title of gods, and offer [[worship]] and sacrifices [[sacrifice]] for the sake of inheriting a future [[life]], we shall, by god's [[help]], endeavour in the following [[book]] to show that these spirits, call them by what name, and ascribe to them what [[nature]] you will, [[desire]] that [[religious]] [[worship]] be paid to [[god]] alone, by whom they were created, and by whose communications of himself to them they are blessed.

argument.

in this [[book]] augustine teaches [[teach]] that the [[good]] angels [[wish]] [[god]] alone, whom they themselves serve, to receive that [[divine]] [[honour]] which is rendered by [[sacrifice]], and which is called "latreia." he then goes on to dispute against porphyry about the [[principle]] and way of the soul's cleansing and deliverance.

1. that the platonists themselves have determined that [[god]] alone can confer [[happiness]] either on angels or [[men]], but that it yet remains a [[question]] whether those spirits whom they direct us to [[worship]], that we may obtain [[happiness]], [[wish]] [[sacrifice]] to be offered to themselves, or to the one [[god]] only.

it is the decided [[opinion]] of all who use their brains, that all [[men]] [[desire]] to be [[happy]]. but who are [[happy]], or how they become so, these are questions [[question]] about which the weakness of [[human]] understanding stirs endless and angry controversies, in which [[philosophers]] have wasted their [[strength]] and expended their leisure. to adduce and discuss their various opinions [[opinion]] would be tedious, and is unnecessary. the reader may [[remember]] what we said in the eighth [[book]], while making a selection of the [[philosophers]] with whom we might discuss the [[question]] regarding the future [[life]] of [[happiness]], whether we can reach it by paying [[divine]] honours [[honour]] to the one true [[god]], the creator of all gods, or by worshipping many gods, and he will not expect us to repeat here the same argument, especially as, even if he has forgotten it, he may refresh his memory by reperusal. for we made selection of the platonists, justly esteemed the noblest of the [[philosophers]], because they had the wit to perceive that the [[human]] [[soul]], [[immortal]] and [[rational]], or intellectual, as it is, cannot be [[happy]] except by partaking of the [[light]] of that [[god]] by whom both itself and the [[world]] were made; and also that the [[happy]] [[life]] which all [[men]] [[desire]] cannot be reached by any who does not cleave with a pure and holy [[love]] to that one supreme [[good]],[pg 383] the unchangeable [[god]]. but as even these [[philosophers]], whether accommodating to the folly and ignorance of the [[people]], or, as the apostle says, "becoming [[vain]] in their imaginations [[imagination]],"[364] supposed or allowed others to suppose that many gods should be worshipped, so that some of them considered that [[divine]] [[honour]] by [[worship]] and [[sacrifice]] should be rendered even to the demons (an error i have already exploded), we must now, by god's [[help]], ascertain what is [[thought]] about our [[religious]] [[worship]] and piety by those [[immortal]] and blessed spirits, who dwell in the heavenly places among dominations, principalities, powers [[power]], whom the platonists call gods, and some either [[good]] demons, or, like us, angels,—that is to say, to put it more plainly, whether the angels [[desire]] us to offer [[sacrifice]] and [[worship]], and to consecrate our possessions and ourselves, to them, or only to [[god]], theirs and ours.

for this is the [[worship]] which is due to the divinity, or, to speak more accurately, to the deity; and, to express this [[worship]] in a [[single]] word, as there does not occur to me any latin term sufficiently exact, i shall avail myself, whenever necessary, of a [[greek]] word. λατρεία, whenever it occurs in [[scripture]], is rendered by the word service. but that service which is due to [[men]], and in reference to which the apostle writes that servants must be [[subject]] to their own masters,[365] is usually designated by another word in [[greek]],[366] whereas the service which is paid to [[god]] alone by [[worship]], is always, or almost always, called λατρεία in the usage of those who wrote from the [[divine]] oracles. this cannot so well be called simply "cultus," for in that case it would not seem to be due exclusively to [[god]]; for the same word is applied to the [[respect]] we [[pay]] either to the memory or the living presence of [[men]]. from it, too, we derive the words agriculture, colonist, and others.[367] and the heathen call their gods "cœlicolæ," not because they [[worship]] [[heaven]], but because they dwell in it, and as it were colonize it,—not in the sense in which we call those colonists who are attached to their native soil to cultivate it[pg 384] under the [[rule]] of the owners, but in the sense in which the [[great]] master of the latin [[language]] says, "there was an ancient [[city]] inhabited by tyrian colonists."[368] he called them colonists, not because they cultivated the soil, but because they inhabited the [[city]]. so, too, cities [[city]] that have hived off from larger cities [[city]] are called colonies. consequently, while it is quite true that, using the word in a special sense, "cult" can be rendered to none but [[god]], yet, as the word is applied to other things besides, the cult due to [[god]] cannot in latin be expressed by this word alone.

the word "religion" might seem to express more definitely the [[worship]] due to [[god]] alone, and therefore latin translators have used this word to represent θρησκεία; yet, as not only the uneducated, but also the [[best]] instructed, use the word [[religion]] to express [[human]] ties, and relationships, and affinities, it would inevitably introduce ambiguity to use this word in discussing the [[worship]] of [[god]], unable as we are to say that [[religion]] is nothing else than the [[worship]] of [[god]], without contradicting the [[common]] usage which applies this word to the observance of social relationships. "piety," again, or, as the greeks [[greek]] say, εὐσέβεια, is commonly understood as the proper designation of the [[worship]] of [[god]]. yet this word also is used of dutifulness to parents. the [[common]] [[people]], too, use it of works [[work]] of charity, which, i suppose, arises from the circumstance that [[god]] enjoins the performance of such works [[work]], and declares that he is pleased with them instead of, or in preference to sacrifices [[sacrifice]]. from this usage it has also come to pass that [[god]] himself is called pious,[369] in which sense the greeks [[greek]] never use εὐσεβεῖν, though εὐσέβεια is applied to works [[work]] of charity by their [[common]] [[people]] also. in some passages of [[scripture]], therefore, they have sought to preserve the distinction by using not εὐσέβεια, the more general word, but θεοσέβεια, which literally denotes the [[worship]] of [[god]]. we, on the other hand, cannot express either of these ideas [[idea]] by one word. this [[worship]], then, which in [[greek]] is called λατρεία, and in latin "servitus" [service], but the service due to [[god]] only; this [[worship]], which in [[greek]] is called θρησκεία, and in[pg 385] latin "religio," but the [[religion]] by which we are bound to [[god]] only; this [[worship]], which they call θεοσέβεια, but which we cannot express in one word, but call it the [[worship]] of [[god]],—this, we say, belongs only to that [[god]] who is the true [[god]], and who makes his worshippers gods.[370] and therefore, whoever these [[immortal]] and blessed inhabitants of [[heaven]] be, if they do not [[love]] us, and [[wish]] us to be blessed, then we ought not to [[worship]] them; and if they do [[love]] us and [[desire]] our [[happiness]], they cannot [[wish]] us to be made [[happy]] by any other means than they themselves have enjoyed,—for how could they [[wish]] our blessedness to flow from one source, theirs from another?

2. the [[opinion]] of plotinus the platonist regarding enlightenment from above.

but with these more estimable [[philosophers]] we have no dispute in this matter. for they perceived, and in various forms abundantly expressed in their writings, that these spirits have the same source of [[happiness]] as ourselves,—a [[certain]] intelligible [[light]], which is their [[god]], and is different from themselves, and illumines them that they may be penetrated with [[light]], and enjoy [[perfect]] [[happiness]] in the participation of [[god]]. plotinus, commenting on [[plato]], repeatedly and strongly asserts that not even the [[soul]] which they [[believe]] to be the [[soul]] of the [[world]], derives its blessedness from any other source than we do, viz. from that [[light]] which is distinct from it and created it, and by whose intelligible illumination it enjoys [[light]] in things intelligible. he also compares those [[spiritual]] things to the vast and conspicuous heavenly bodies [[body]], as if [[god]] were the sun, and the [[soul]] the moon; for they suppose that the moon derives its [[light]] from the sun. that [[great]] platonist, therefore, says that the [[rational]] [[soul]], or rather the intellectual [[soul]],—in which class he comprehends the souls [[soul]] of the blessed immortals [[immortal]] who inhabit [[heaven]],—has no [[nature]] superior to it save [[god]], the creator of the [[world]] and the [[soul]] itself, and that these heavenly spirits derive their blessed [[life]], and the [[light]] of [[truth]], from the same source as ourselves, agreeing with the gospel where we [[read]], "there was a [[man]] sent from [[god]] whose name was john; the same came for a witness to bear witness of that [[light]], that through him[pg 386] all might [[believe]]. he was not that [[light]], but that he might bear witness of the [[light]]. that was the true [[light]] which lighteth every [[man]] that cometh into the [[world]];"[371]—a distinction which sufficiently proves that the [[rational]] or intellectual [[soul]] such as john had cannot be its own [[light]], but needs to receive illumination from another, the true [[light]]. this john himself avows when he delivers his witness: "we have all received of his fulness."[372]

3. that the platonists, though knowing something of the creator of the [[universe]], have misunderstood the true [[worship]] of [[god]], by giving [[divine]] [[honour]] to angels, [[good]] or [[bad]].

this being so, if the platonists, or those who [[think]] with them, knowing [[god]], glorified him as [[god]] and gave thanks, if they did not become [[vain]] in their own thoughts [[thought]], if they did not originate or yield to the popular errors, they would certainly acknowledge that neither could the blessed immortals [[immortal]] retain, nor we miserable mortals reach, a [[happy]] condition without worshipping the one [[god]] of gods, who is both theirs and ours. to him we owe the service which is called in [[greek]] λατρεία, whether we render it outwardly or inwardly; for we are all his temple, each of us severally and all of us together, because he condescends to inhabit each individually and the whole harmonious [[body]], being no greater in all than in each, since he is neither expanded nor divided. our [[heart]] when it rises to him is his altar; the [[priest]] who intercedes for us is his only-begotten; we [[sacrifice]] to him bleeding victims when we contend for his [[truth]] even unto [[blood]]; to him we offer the sweetest incense when we come before him burning with holy and pious [[love]]; to him we devote and [[surrender]] ourselves and his gifts in us; to him, by solemn feasts and on appointed days, we consecrate the memory of his benefits, lest through the lapse of [[time]] ungrateful oblivion should steal upon us; to him we offer on the altar of our [[heart]] the [[sacrifice]] of [[humility]] and [[praise]], kindled by the [[fire]] of burning [[love]]. it is that we may see him, so far as he can be seen; it is that we may cleave to him, that we are cleansed from all stain of sins [[sin]] and [[evil]] [[passions]], and are consecrated in his name. for he is the fountain of our [[happiness]],[pg 387] he the end of all our desires [[desire]]. being attached to him, or rather let me say, re-attached,—for we had detached ourselves and lost hold of him,—being, i say, re-attached to him,[373] we tend towards him by [[love]], that we may rest in him, and find our blessedness by attaining that end. for our [[good]], about which [[philosophers]] have so keenly contended, is nothing else than to be [[united]] to [[god]]. it is, if i may say so, by spiritually embracing him that the intellectual [[soul]] is filled and impregnated with true virtues [[virtue]]. we are enjoined to [[love]] this [[good]] with all our [[heart]], with all our [[soul]], with all our [[strength]]. to this [[good]] we ought to be [[led]] by those who [[love]] us, and to lead those we [[love]]. thus are fulfilled those two commandments on which hang all the [[law]] and the prophets [[prophet]]: "thou shalt [[love]] the [[lord]] thy [[god]] with all thy [[heart]], and with all thy [[mind]], and with all thy [[soul]];" and "thou shalt [[love]] thy neighbour as thyself."[374] for, that [[man]] might be [[intelligent]] in his self-love, there was appointed for him an end to which he might refer all his actions, that he might be blessed. for he who loves [[love]] himself wishes [[wish]] nothing else than this. and the end set before him is "to draw near to [[god]]."[375] and so, when one who has this [[intelligent]] self-love is commanded to [[love]] his neighbour as himself, what else is enjoined than that he shall do all in his [[power]] to commend to him the [[love]] of [[god]]? this is the [[worship]] of [[god]], this is true [[religion]], this [[right]] piety, this the service due to [[god]] only. if any [[immortal]] [[power]], then, no matter with what [[virtue]] endowed, loves [[love]] us as himself, he must [[desire]] that we find our [[happiness]] by submitting ourselves to him, in submission to whom he himself finds [[happiness]]. if he does not [[worship]] [[god]], he is wretched, because deprived of [[god]]; if he worships [[god]], he cannot [[wish]] to be worshipped in god's stead. on the contrary, these higher powers [[power]] acquiesce heartily in the [[divine]] sentence in which it is written, "he that sacrificeth unto any [[god]], save unto the [[lord]] only, he shall be utterly destroyed."[376]

4. that [[sacrifice]] is due to the true [[god]] only.

but, putting aside for the [[present]] the other [[religious]] services[pg 388] with which [[god]] is worshipped, certainly no [[man]] would dare to say that [[sacrifice]] is due to any but [[god]]. many parts, indeed, of [[divine]] [[worship]] are unduly used in showing [[honour]] to [[men]], whether through an excessive [[humility]] or pernicious [[flattery]]; yet, while this is done, those persons [[person]] who are thus worshipped and venerated, or even adored, are reckoned no more than [[human]]; and who ever [[thought]] of sacrificing save to one whom he knew, supposed, or feigned to be a [[god]]? and how ancient a part of god's [[worship]] [[sacrifice]] is, those two brothers [[brother]], cain and abel, sufficiently show, of whom [[god]] rejected the elder's [[sacrifice]], and looked favourably on the younger's.

5. of the sacrifices [[sacrifice]] which [[god]] does not require, but wished to be observed for the exhibition of those things which he does require.

and who is so foolish as to suppose that the things offered to [[god]] are needed by him for some uses of his own? [[divine]] [[scripture]] in many places explodes this [[idea]]. not to be wearisome, suffice it to quote this brief saying from a psalm: "i have said to the [[lord]], thou art [[arts]] my [[god]]: for thou needest not my goodness."[377] we must [[believe]], then, that [[god]] has no need, not only of cattle, or any other earthly and material thing, but even of man's [[man]] [[righteousness]], and that whatever [[right]] [[worship]] is paid to [[god]] profits [[profit]] not him, but [[man]]. for no [[man]] would say he did a benefit to a fountain by drinking, or to the [[light]] by seeing. and the [[fact]] that the ancient [[church]] offered animal sacrifices [[sacrifice]], which the [[people]] of [[god]] now-a-days reads of without imitating, proves nothing else than this, that those sacrifices [[sacrifice]] signified the things which we do for the [[purpose]] of drawing near to [[god]], and inducing our neighbour to do the same. a [[sacrifice]], therefore, is the visible sacrament or [[sacred]] sign of an invisible [[sacrifice]]. hence that penitent in the psalm, or it may be the psalmist himself, entreating [[god]] to be merciful to his sins [[sin]], says, "if thou desiredst [[sacrifice]], i would give it: thou delightest not in whole burnt-offerings. the [[sacrifice]] of [[god]] is a broken [[heart]]: a [[heart]] contrite and humble [[god]] will not despise."[378] observe how, in the very words in which he is expressing god's refusal of [[sacrifice]], he shows that [[god]] requires [[sacrifice]]. he does[pg 389] not [[desire]] the [[sacrifice]] of a slaughtered beast, but he desires [[desire]] the [[sacrifice]] of a contrite [[heart]]. thus, that [[sacrifice]] which he says [[god]] does not [[wish]], is the symbol of the [[sacrifice]] which [[god]] does [[wish]]. [[god]] does not [[wish]] sacrifices [[sacrifice]] in the sense in which foolish [[people]] [[think]] he wishes [[wish]] them, viz. to gratify his own [[pleasure]]. for if he had not wished that the sacrifices [[sacrifice]] he requires, as, e.g., a [[heart]] contrite and humbled by penitent [[sorrow]], should be symbolized by those sacrifices [[sacrifice]] which he was [[thought]] to [[desire]] because pleasant to himself, the old [[law]] would never have enjoined their presentation; and they were destined to be merged when the fit opportunity arrived, in order that [[men]] might not suppose that the sacrifices [[sacrifice]] themselves, rather than the things symbolized by them, were pleasing to [[god]] or acceptable in us. hence, in another passage from another psalm, he says, "if i were hungry, i would not tell thee; for the [[world]] is mine and the fulness thereof. will i [[eat]] the flesh of bulls, or drink the [[blood]] of goats?"[379] as if he should say, supposing such things were necessary to me, i would never ask thee for what i have in my own hand. then he goes on to mention what these signify: "offer unto [[god]] the [[sacrifice]] of [[praise]], and [[pay]] thy vows unto the most high. and call upon me in the day of trouble: i will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."[380] so in another [[prophet]]: "wherewith shall i come before the [[lord]], and bow myself before the high [[god]]? shall i come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? will the [[lord]] be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of [[oil]]? shall i give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my [[body]] for the [[sin]] of my [[soul]]? hath he showed thee, o [[man]], what is [[good]]; and what doth the [[lord]] require of thee, but to do justly, and to [[love]] [[mercy]], and to walk humbly with thy [[god]]?"[381] in the words of this [[prophet]], these two things are distinguished and set forth with sufficient explicitness, that [[god]] does not require these sacrifices [[sacrifice]] for their own sakes, and that he does require the sacrifices [[sacrifice]] which they symbolize. in the epistle entitled "to the hebrews" it is said, "to do [[good]] and to communicate, forget not: for with such sacrifices [[sacrifice]] [[god]] is well pleased."[382] and so,[pg 390] when it is written, "i [[desire]] [[mercy]] rather than [[sacrifice]],"[383] nothing else is meant than that one [[sacrifice]] is preferred to another; for that which in [[common]] [[speech]] is called [[sacrifice]] is only the symbol of the true [[sacrifice]]. now [[mercy]] is the true [[sacrifice]], and therefore it is said, as i have just quoted, "with such sacrifices [[sacrifice]] [[god]] is well pleased." all the [[divine]] ordinances, therefore, which we [[read]] concerning the sacrifices [[sacrifice]] in the service of the tabernacle or the temple, we are to refer to the [[love]] of [[god]] and our neighbour. for "on these two commandments," as it is written, "hang all the [[law]] and the prophets [[prophet]]."[384]

6. of the true and [[perfect]] [[sacrifice]].

thus a true [[sacrifice]] is every [[work]] which is done that we may be [[united]] to [[god]] in holy fellowship, and which has a reference to that supreme [[good]] and end in which alone we can be truly blessed.[385] and therefore even the [[mercy]] we show to [[men]], if it is not shown for god's sake, is not a [[sacrifice]]. for, though made or offered by [[man]], [[sacrifice]] is a [[divine]] thing, as those who called it sacrifice[386] meant to indicate. thus [[man]] himself, consecrated in the name of [[god]], and vowed to [[god]], is a [[sacrifice]] in so far as he dies to the [[world]] that he may [[live]] to [[god]]. for this is a part of that [[mercy]] which each [[man]] shows to himself; as it is written, "have [[mercy]] on thy [[soul]] by pleasing [[god]]."[387] our [[body]], too, is a [[sacrifice]] when we chasten it by temperance, if we do so as we ought, for god's sake, that we may not yield our members instruments of unrighteousness unto [[sin]], but instruments of [[righteousness]] unto [[god]].[388] exhorting to this [[sacrifice]], the apostle says, "i beseech you, therefore, brethren [[brother]], by the [[mercy]] of [[god]], that ye [[present]] your bodies [[body]] a living [[sacrifice]], holy, acceptable to [[god]], which is your reasonable service."[389] if, then, the [[body]], which, being inferior, the [[soul]] uses as a servant or instrument, is a [[sacrifice]] when it is used rightly, and with reference to [[god]], how much more does the [[soul]] itself become[pg 391] a [[sacrifice]] when it offers itself to [[god]], in order that, being inflamed by the [[fire]] of his [[love]], it may receive of his [[beauty]] and become pleasing to him, losing the shape of earthly [[desire]], and being remoulded in the image of permanent loveliness? and this, indeed, the apostle subjoins, saying, "and be not conformed to this [[world]]; but be ye transformed in the renewing of your [[mind]], that ye may prove what is that [[good]], and acceptable, and [[perfect]] will of [[god]]."[390] since, therefore, true sacrifices [[sacrifice]] are works [[work]] of [[mercy]] to ourselves or others, done with a reference to [[god]], and since works [[work]] of [[mercy]] have no other object than the relief of distress or the conferring of [[happiness]], and since there is no [[happiness]] apart from that [[good]] of which it is said, "it is [[good]] for me to be very near to [[god]],"[391] it follows that the whole redeemed [[city]], that is to say, the congregation or [[community]] of the saints, is offered to [[god]] as our [[sacrifice]] through the [[great]] high [[priest]], who offered himself to [[god]] in his passion for us, that we might be members of this glorious head, according to the form of a servant. for it was this form he offered, in this he was offered, because it is according to it he is mediator, in this he is our [[priest]], in this the [[sacrifice]]. accordingly, when the apostle had exhorted us to [[present]] our bodies [[body]] a living [[sacrifice]], holy, acceptable to [[god]], our reasonable service, and not to be conformed to the [[world]], but to be transformed in the renewing of our [[mind]], that we might prove what is that [[good]], and acceptable, and [[perfect]] will of [[god]], that is to say, the true [[sacrifice]] of ourselves, he says, "for i say, through the grace of [[god]] which is given unto me, to every [[man]] that is among you, not to [[think]] of himself more highly than he ought to [[think]], but to [[think]] soberly, according as [[god]] hath dealt to every [[man]] the measure of [[faith]]. for, as we have many members in one [[body]], and all members have not the same office, so we, being many, are one [[body]] in [[christ]], and every one members one of another, having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us."[392] this is the [[sacrifice]] of christians [[christian]]: we, being many, are one [[body]] in [[christ]]. and this also is the [[sacrifice]] which the [[church]] continually celebrates in the sacrament of the altar, known to the faithful, in which[pg 392] she teaches [[teach]] that she herself is offered in the offering she makes to [[god]].

7. of the [[love]] of the holy angels, which prompts them to [[desire]] that we [[worship]] the one true [[god]], and not themselves.

it is very [[right]] that these blessed and [[immortal]] spirits, who inhabit celestial dwellings, and rejoice in the communications of their creator's fulness, firm in his eternity, assured in his [[truth]], holy by his grace, since they compassionately and tenderly regard us miserable mortals, and [[wish]] us to become [[immortal]] and [[happy]], do not [[desire]] us to [[sacrifice]] to themselves, but to him whose [[sacrifice]] they [[know]] themselves to be in [[common]] with us. for we and they together are the one [[city]] of [[god]], to which it is said in the psalm, "glorious things are spoken of thee, o [[city]] of [[god]];"[393] the [[human]] part sojourning here below, the angelic aiding from above. for from that heavenly [[city]], in which god's will is the intelligible and unchangeable [[law]], from that heavenly council-chamber,—for they sit in counsel regarding us,—that holy [[scripture]], descended to us by the ministry of angels, in which it is written, "he that sacrificeth unto any [[god]], save unto the [[lord]] only, he shall be utterly destroyed,"[394]—this [[scripture]], this [[law]], these precepts, have been confirmed by such [[miracles]], that it is sufficiently evident to whom these [[immortal]] and blessed spirits, who [[desire]] us to be like themselves, [[wish]] us to [[sacrifice]].

8. of the [[miracles]] which [[god]] has condescended to adhibit, through the ministry of angels, to his promises for the confirmation of the [[faith]] of the godly.

i should seem tedious were i to recount all the ancient [[miracles]], which were wrought in attestation of god's promises which he made to [[abraham]] thousands of years ago, that in his seed all the nations of the [[earth]] should be blessed.[395] for who can but marvel that abraham's barren [[wife]] should have given birth to a [[son]] at an [[age]] when not even a prolific woman could bear [[children]]; or, again, that when [[abraham]] sacrificed, a flame from [[heaven]] should have run between the divided parts;[396] or that the angels in [[human]] form, whom he had hospitably entertained, and who had renewed god's promise[pg 393] of offspring, should also have predicted the destruction of sodom by [[fire]] from [[heaven]];[397] and that his nephew lot should have been rescued from sodom by the angels as the [[fire]] was just descending, while his [[wife]], who looked back as she went, and was immediately turned into salt, stood as a [[sacred]] beacon warning us that no one who is being saved should long for what he is leaving? how striking also were the wonders done by [[moses]] to rescue god's [[people]] from the yoke of [[slavery]] in [[egypt]], when the magi of the pharaoh, that is, the [[king]] of [[egypt]], who tyrannized over this [[people]], were [[suffered]] to do some wonderful things that they might be vanquished all the more signally! they did these things by the magical [[arts]] and incantations to which the [[evil]] spirits or demons are addicted; while [[moses]], having as much greater [[power]] as he had [[right]] on his side, and having the aid of angels, easily conquered them in the name of the [[lord]] who made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]. and, in [[fact]], the magicians failed at the third plague; whereas [[moses]], dealing out the [[miracles]] delegated to him, brought ten plagues upon the [[land]], so that the hard hearts [[heart]] of pharaoh and the [[egyptians]] yielded, and the [[people]] were let go. but, quickly repenting, and essaying to overtake the departing hebrews, who had crossed the sea on dry ground, they were covered and overwhelmed in the returning waters. what shall i say of those frequent and stupendous exhibitions of [[divine]] [[power]], while the [[people]] were conducted through the wilderness?—of the waters which could not be drunk, but lost their bitterness, and quenched the thirsty, when at god's command a piece of wood was cast into them? of the manna that descended from [[heaven]] to appease their [[hunger]], and which begat worms and putrefied when any one collected more than the appointed quantity, and yet, though double was gathered on the day before the [[sabbath]] (it not being lawful to gather it on that day), remained fresh? of the birds which filled the camp, and turned appetite into satiety when they longed for flesh, which it seemed impossible to supply to so vast a [[population]]? of the enemies [[enemy]] who met them, and opposed their passage with arms, and were defeated without the loss of a [[single]] [[hebrew]], when[pg 394] [[moses]] prayed with his hands extended in the form of a cross? of the seditious persons [[person]] who arose among god's [[people]], and separated themselves from the divinely-ordered [[community]], and were swallowed up alive by the [[earth]], a visible token of an invisible [[punishment]]? of the rock struck with the rod, and pouring out waters more than enough for all the host? of the deadly serpents' bites, sent in just [[punishment]] of [[sin]], but healed by looking at the lifted brazen serpent, so that not only were the tormented [[people]] healed, but a symbol of the crucifixion of [[death]] set before them in this destruction of [[death]] by [[death]]? it was this serpent which was preserved in memory of this event, and was afterwards worshipped by the mistaken [[people]] as an idol, and was destroyed by the pious and god-fearing [[king]] hezekiah, much to his credit.

9. of the illicit [[arts]] connected with demonolatry, and of which the platonist porphyry adopts some, and discards others.

these [[miracles]], and many others of the same [[nature]], which it were tedious to mention, were wrought for the [[purpose]] of commending the [[worship]] of the one true [[god]], and prohibiting the [[worship]] of a multitude of false gods. moreover, they were wrought by simple [[faith]] and godly confidence, not by the incantations and charms composed under the influence of a [[criminal]] tampering with the unseen [[world]], of an art [[arts]] which they call either magic, or by the more abominable title necromancy,[398] or the more honourable designation theurgy; for they [[wish]] to discriminate between those whom the [[people]] call magicians, who practise necromancy, and are addicted to illicit [[arts]] and condemned, and those others who seem to them to be worthy of [[praise]] for their practice of theurgy,—the [[truth]], however, being that both classes are the slaves [[slave]] of the deceitful rites of the demons whom they invoke under the names of angels.

for even porphyry promises some [[kind]] of purgation of the [[soul]] by the [[help]] of theurgy, though he does so with some hesitation and shame, and denies that this art [[arts]] can secure to any one a return to [[god]]; so that you can detect his [[opinion]] vacillating between the profession of [[philosophy]] and an art [[arts]] which he feels [[feel]] to be presumptuous and sacrilegious. for at[pg 395] one [[time]] he warns us to avoid it as deceitful, and prohibited by [[law]], and dangerous to those who practise it; then again, as if in deference to its advocates, he declares it useful for cleansing one part of the [[soul]], not, indeed, the intellectual part, by which the [[truth]] of things intelligible, which have no sensible images, is recognised, but the [[spiritual]] part, which takes cognizance of the images of things material. this part, he says, is prepared and fitted for intercourse with spirits and angels, and for the vision of the gods, by the [[help]] of [[certain]] theurgic consecrations, or, as they call them, mysteries. he acknowledges, however, that these theurgic mysteries impart to the intellectual [[soul]] no such purity as fits it to see its [[god]], and recognise the things that truly [[exist]]. and from this acknowledgment we may infer what [[kind]] of gods these are, and what [[kind]] of vision of them is imparted by theurgic consecrations, if by it one cannot see the things which truly [[exist]]. he says, further, that the [[rational]], or, as he prefers calling it, the intellectual [[soul]], can pass into the heavens [[heaven]] without the [[spiritual]] part being cleansed by theurgic art [[arts]], and that this art [[arts]] cannot so purify the [[spiritual]] part as to give it entrance to immortality and eternity. and therefore, although he distinguishes angels from demons, asserting that the habitation of the latter is in the air, while the former dwell in the ether and empyrean, and although he advises us to cultivate the [[friendship]] of some demon, who may be able after our [[death]] to assist us, and elevate us at least a little above the [[earth]],—for he owns that it is by another way we must reach the heavenly [[society]] of the angels,—he at the same [[time]] distinctly warns us to avoid the [[society]] of demons, saying that the [[soul]], expiating its [[sin]] after [[death]], execrates the [[worship]] of demons by whom it was entangled. and of theurgy itself, though he recommends it as reconciling angels and demons, he cannot deny that it treats with powers [[power]] which either themselves envy the [[soul]] its purity, or serve the [[arts]] of those who do envy it. he complains of this through the mouth of some chaldæan or other: "a [[good]] [[man]] in chaldæa complains," he says, "that his most strenuous efforts to cleanse his [[soul]] were frustrated, because another [[man]], who had influence in these matters, and who envied him purity, had prayed to the powers [[power]], and bound them by his conjuring[pg 396] not to listen to his request. therefore," adds porphyry, "what the one [[man]] bound, the other could not loose." and from this he concludes that theurgy is a craft which accomplishes not only [[good]] but [[evil]] among gods and [[men]]; and that the gods also have [[passions]], and are perturbed and agitated by the emotions which apuleius attributed to demons and [[men]], but from which he preserved the gods by that sublimity of residence, which, in [[common]] with [[plato]], he accorded to them.

10. concerning theurgy, which promises a delusive purification of the [[soul]] by the invocation of demons.

but here we have another and a much more learned platonist than apuleius, porphyry, to wit, asserting that, by i [[know]] not what theurgy, even the gods themselves are subjected to [[passions]] and perturbations; for by adjurations they were so bound and terrified that they could not confer purity of [[soul]],—were so terrified by him who imposed on them a wicked command, that they could not by the same theurgy be freed from that terror, and fulfil the righteous behest of him who prayed to them, or do the [[good]] he sought. who does not see that all these things are fictions of deceiving demons, unless he be a wretched [[slave]] of theirs, and an alien from the grace of the true liberator? for if the chaldæan had been dealing with [[good]] gods, certainly a well-disposed [[man]], who sought to purify his own [[soul]], would have had more influence with them than an evil-disposed [[man]] seeking to hinder him. or, if the gods were just, and considered the [[man]] unworthy of the purification he sought, at all events they should not have been terrified by an envious [[person]], nor hindered, as porphyry avows, by the [[fear]] of a stronger deity, but should have simply denied the boon on their own [[free]] [[judgment]]. and it is surprising that that well-disposed chaldæan, who [[desired]] to purify his [[soul]] by theurgical rites, found no superior deity who could either terrify the frightened gods still more, and [[force]] them to confer the boon, or compose their fears [[fear]], and so enable them to do [[good]] without compulsion,—even supposing that the [[good]] theurgist had no rites by which he himself might purge away the taint of [[fear]] from the gods whom he invoked for the purification of his own [[soul]]. and why is it that there is a [[god]] who has [[power]] to terrify the inferior gods, and none who has[pg 397] [[power]] to [[free]] them from [[fear]]? is there found a [[god]] who listens to the envious [[man]], and frightens the gods from doing [[good]]? and is there not found a [[god]] who listens to the well-disposed [[man]], and removes the [[fear]] of the gods that they may do him [[good]]? o excellent theurgy! o admirable purification of the soul!—a theurgy in which the [[violence]] of an impure envy has more influence than the entreaty of purity and holiness. rather let us abominate and avoid the deceit of such wicked spirits, and listen to sound doctrine. as to those who perform these filthy cleansings by sacrilegious rites, and see in their initiated [[state]] (as he further tells us, though we may [[question]] this vision) [[certain]] wonderfully lovely appearances of angels or gods, this is what the apostle refers to when he speaks of "satan transforming himself into an angel of [[light]]."[399] for these are the delusive appearances of that spirit who longs to entangle wretched souls [[soul]] in the deceptive [[worship]] of many and false gods, and to turn them aside from the true [[worship]] of the true [[god]], by whom alone they are cleansed and healed, and who, as was said of proteus, "turns himself into all shapes,"[400] equally hurtful, whether he assaults us as an [[enemy]], or assumes the [[disguise]] of a friend.

11. of porphyry's epistle to anebo, in which he asks for information about the differences among demons.

it was a [[better]] tone which porphyry adopted in his letter to anebo the egyptian, in which, assuming the [[character]] of an inquirer consulting him, he unmasks and explodes these sacrilegious [[arts]]. in that letter, indeed, he repudiates all demons, whom he maintains to be so foolish as to be attracted by the sacrificial vapours, and therefore residing not in the ether, but in the air beneath the moon, and indeed in the moon itself. yet he has not the boldness to attribute to all the demons all the deceptions and malicious and foolish practices which justly move his indignation. for, though he acknowledges that as a [[race]] demons are foolish, he so far accommodates himself to popular ideas [[idea]] as to call some of them benignant demons. he expresses surprise that sacrifices [[sacrifice]] not only incline the gods, but also compel and [[force]] them to do what [[men]] [[wish]]; and he is at a loss to [[understand]] how the[pg 398] sun and moon, and other visible celestial bodies [[body]],—for bodies [[body]] he does not [[doubt]] that they are,—are considered gods, if the gods are distinguished from the demons by their incorporeality; also, if they are gods, how some are called beneficent and others hurtful, and how they, being corporeal, are numbered with the gods, who are incorporeal. he inquires further, and still as one in [[doubt]], whether diviners and wonderworkers are [[men]] of unusually powerful souls [[soul]], or whether the [[power]] to do these things is communicated by spirits from without. he inclines to the latter [[opinion]], on the ground that it is by the use of stones and herbs that they lay spells on [[people]], and open closed doors, and do similar wonders. and on this account, he says, some suppose that there is a [[race]] of beings whose [[property]] it is to listen to [[men]],—a [[race]] deceitful, full of contrivances, capable of assuming all forms, simulating gods, demons, and [[dead]] [[men]],—and that it is this [[race]] which brings about all these things which have the appearance of [[good]] or [[evil]], but that what is really [[good]] they never [[help]] us in, and are indeed unacquainted with, for they make wickedness easy, but throw obstacles in the path of those who eagerly [[follow]] [[virtue]]; and that they are filled with [[pride]] and rashness, delight in sacrificial odours, are taken with [[flattery]]. these and the other characteristics of this [[race]] of deceitful and malicious spirits, who come into the souls [[soul]] of [[men]] and delude their senses, both in sleep and waking, he describes not as things of which he is himself convinced, but only with so much suspicion and [[doubt]] as to cause him to speak of them as commonly received opinions [[opinion]]. we should sympathize with this [[great]] philosopher in the difficulty he experienced in acquainting himself with and confidently assailing the whole fraternity of devils [[devil]], which any [[christian]] old woman would unhesitatingly describe and most unreservedly detest. perhaps, however, he shrank from offending anebo, to whom he was writing, himself the most eminent patron of these mysteries, or the others who marvelled at these magical feats as [[divine]] works [[work]], and closely allied to the [[worship]] of the gods.

however, he pursues this [[subject]], and, still in the [[character]] of an inquirer, mentions some things which no sober [[judgment]] could attribute to any but malicious and deceitful powers [[power]].[pg 399] he asks why, after the [[better]] class of spirits have been invoked, the worse should be commanded to perform the wicked desires [[desire]] of [[men]]; why they do not hear a [[man]] who has just left a woman's embrace, while they themselves make no scruple of tempting [[men]] to incest and adultery; why their priests [[priest]] are commanded to abstain from animal food for [[fear]] of being polluted by the corporeal exhalations, while they themselves are attracted by the fumes of sacrifices [[sacrifice]] and other exhalations; why the initiated are forbidden to touch a [[dead]] [[body]], while their mysteries are celebrated almost entirely by means of [[dead]] bodies [[body]]; why it is that a [[man]] addicted to any [[vice]] should utter threats, not to a demon or to the [[soul]] of a [[dead]] [[man]], but to the sun and moon, or some of the heavenly bodies [[body]], which he intimidates by imaginary terrors, that he may wring from them a real boon,—for he threatens that he will demolish the [[sky]], and such like impossibilities,—that those gods, being alarmed, like silly [[children]], with imaginary and absurd threats, may do what they are ordered. porphyry further relates that a [[man]] chæremon, profoundly versed in these [[sacred]] or rather sacrilegious mysteries, had written that the famous egyptian mysteries of isis and her husband osiris had very [[great]] influence with the gods to compel them to do what they were ordered, when he who used the spells threatened to divulge or do away with these mysteries, and cried with a threatening voice that he would scatter the members of osiris if they neglected his orders. not without [[reason]] is porphyry surprised that a [[man]] should utter such wild and empty threats against the gods,—not against gods of no account, but against the heavenly gods, and those that shine with sidereal [[light]],—and that these threats should be effectual to constrain them with resistless [[power]], and alarm them so that they fulfil his wishes [[wish]]. not without [[reason]] does he, in the [[character]] of an inquirer into the reasons [[reason]] of these surprising things, give it to be understood that they are done by that [[race]] of spirits which he previously described as if quoting other people's opinions [[opinion]],—spirits who [[deceive]] not, as he said, by [[nature]], but by their own [[corruption]], and who simulate gods and [[dead]] [[men]], but not, as he said, demons, for demons they really are. as to his [[idea]] that by means of herbs, and stones, and animals, and[pg 400] [[certain]] incantations and noises, and drawings, sometimes fanciful, and sometimes copied from the motions of the heavenly bodies [[body]], [[men]] create upon [[earth]] powers [[power]] capable of bringing about various results, all that is only the mystification which these demons practise on those who are [[subject]] to them, for the sake of furnishing themselves with merriment at the expense of their dupes. either, then, porphyry was sincere in his doubts [[doubt]] and inquiries, and mentioned these things to demonstrate and put beyond [[question]] that they were the [[work]], not of powers [[power]] which aid us in obtaining [[life]], but of deceitful demons; or, to take a more favourable view of the philosopher, he adopted this method with the egyptian who was wedded to these errors, and was proud of them, that he might not offend him by assuming the attitude of a teacher, nor discompose his [[mind]] by the altercation of a professed assailant, but, by assuming the [[character]] of an inquirer, and the humble attitude of one who was anxious to learn, might turn his attention to these matters, and show how worthy they are to be despised and relinquished. towards the conclusion of his letter, he requests anebo to inform him what the egyptian [[wisdom]] indicates as the way to blessedness. but as to those who hold intercourse with the gods, and pester them only for the sake of finding a runaway [[slave]], or acquiring [[property]], or making a bargain of a [[marriage]], or such things, he declares that their pretensions to [[wisdom]] are [[vain]]. he adds that these same gods, even granting that on other points their utterances were true, were yet so ill-advised and unsatisfactory in their disclosures about blessedness, that they cannot be either gods or [[good]] demons, but are either that spirit who is called the deceiver, or mere fictions of the [[imagination]].

12. of the [[miracles]] wrought by the true [[god]] through the ministry of the holy angels.

since by means of these [[arts]] wonders are done which quite surpass [[human]] [[power]], what [[choice]] have we but to [[believe]] that these predictions and operations, which seem to be miraculous and [[divine]], and which at the same [[time]] form no part of the [[worship]] of the one [[god]], in adherence to whom, as the platonists themselves abundantly testify, all blessedness consists, are the pastime of wicked spirits, who thus seek to seduce and hinder[pg 401] the truly godly? on the other hand, we cannot but [[believe]] that all [[miracles]], whether wrought by angels or by other means, so long as they are so done as to commend the [[worship]] and [[religion]] of the one [[god]] in whom alone is blessedness, are wrought by those who [[love]] us in a true and godly sort, or through their means, [[god]] himself working in them. for we cannot listen to those who maintain that the invisible [[god]] works [[work]] no visible [[miracles]]; for even they [[believe]] that he made the [[world]], which surely they will not deny to be visible. whatever marvel happens in this [[world]], it is certainly less marvellous than this whole [[world]] itself,—i mean the [[sky]] and [[earth]], and all that is in them,—and these [[god]] certainly made. but, as the creator himself is hidden and incomprehensible to [[man]], so also is the manner of creation. although, therefore, the standing miracle of this visible [[world]] is little [[thought]] of, because always before us, yet, when we arouse ourselves to contemplate it, it is a greater miracle than the rarest and most unheard-of marvels. for [[man]] himself is a greater miracle than any miracle done through his instrumentality. therefore [[god]], who made the visible [[heaven]] and [[earth]], does not disdain to [[work]] visible [[miracles]] in [[heaven]] or [[earth]], that he may thereby awaken the [[soul]] which is immersed in things visible to [[worship]] himself, the invisible. but the place and [[time]] of these [[miracles]] are dependent on his unchangeable will, in which things future are ordered as if already they were accomplished. for he moves things temporal without himself moving in [[time]]. he does not in one way [[know]] things that are to be, and, in another, things that have been; neither does he listen to those who [[pray]] otherwise than as he sees those that will [[pray]]. for, even when his angels hear us, it is he himself who hears us in them, as in his true temple not made with hands, as in those [[men]] who are his saints; and his answers [[answer]], though accomplished in [[time]], have been arranged by his eternal appointment.

13. of the invisible [[god]], who has often made himself visible, not as he really is, but as the beholders could bear the sight.

neither need we be surprised that [[god]], invisible as he is, should often have appeared visibly to the patriarchs. for as the sound which communicates the [[thought]] conceived in[pg 402] the [[silence]] of the [[mind]] is not the [[thought]] itself, so the form by which [[god]], invisible in his own [[nature]], became visible, was not [[god]] himself. nevertheless it is he himself who was seen under that form, as that [[thought]] itself is heard in the sound of the voice; and the patriarchs recognised that, though the bodily form was not [[god]], they saw the invisible [[god]]. for, though [[moses]] conversed with [[god]], yet he said, 'if i have found grace in thy sight, show me thyself, that i may see and [[know]] thee.'[401] and as it was fit that the [[law]], which was given, not to one [[man]] or a few enlightened [[men]], but to the whole of a populous nation, should be accompanied by awe-inspiring signs, [[great]] marvels were wrought, by the ministry of angels, before the [[people]] on the mount where the [[law]] was being given to them through one [[man]], while the multitude beheld the awful appearances. for the [[people]] of [[israel]] believed [[moses]], not as the lacedæmonians believed their lycurgus, because he had received from [[jupiter]] or [[apollo]] the laws [[law]] he gave them. for when the [[law]] which enjoined the [[worship]] of one [[god]] was given to the [[people]], marvellous signs and earthquakes, such as the [[divine]] [[wisdom]] judged sufficient, were brought about in the sight of all, that they might [[know]] that it was the creator who could thus use creation to promulgate his [[law]].

14. that the one [[god]] is to be worshipped not only for the sake of eternal blessings, but also in connection with temporal [[prosperity]], because all things are regulated by his providence.

the [[education]] of the [[human]] [[race]], represented by the [[people]] of [[god]], has advanced, like that of an [[individual]], through [[certain]] epochs, or, as it were, ages [[age]], so that it might gradually rise from earthly to heavenly things, and from the visible to the invisible. this object was kept so clearly in view, that, even in the period when temporal rewards [[reward]] were promised, the one [[god]] was presented as the object of [[worship]], that [[men]] might not acknowledge any other than the true creator and [[lord]] of the spirit, even in connection with the earthly blessings of this transitory [[life]]. for he who denies that all things, which either angels or [[men]] can give us, are in the hand of the one almighty, is a madman. the platonist plotinus discourses[pg 403] concerning providence, and, from the [[beauty]] of flowers and foliage, proves that from the supreme [[god]], whose [[beauty]] is unseen and ineffable, providence reaches down even to these earthly things here below; and he argues that all these frail and perishing things could not have so exquisite and elaborate a [[beauty]], were they not fashioned by him whose unseen and unchangeable [[beauty]] continually pervades all things.[402] this is proved also by the [[lord]] [[jesus]], where he says, 'consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his [[glory]] was not arrayed like one of these. but if [[god]] so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven, how much more shall he clothe you, o ye of little faith!'[403] it was [[best]], therefore, that the [[soul]] of [[man]], which was still weakly desiring earthly things, should be accustomed to seek from [[god]] alone even these petty temporal boons, and the earthly necessaries of this transitory [[life]], which are contemptible in comparison with eternal blessings, in order that the [[desire]] even of these things might not draw it aside from the [[worship]] of him, to whom we come by despising and forsaking such things.

15. of the ministry of the holy angels, by which they fulfil the providence of [[god]].

and so it has pleased [[divine]] providence, as i have said, and as we [[read]] in the acts of the [[apostles]],[404] that the [[law]] enjoining the [[worship]] of one [[god]] should be given by the disposition of angels. but among them the [[person]] of [[god]] himself visibly appeared, not, indeed, in his proper substance, which ever remains invisible to mortal [[eyes]], but by the infallible signs furnished by creation in [[obedience]] to its creator. he made use, too, of the words of [[human]] [[speech]], uttering them syllable by syllable successively, though in his own [[nature]] he speaks not in a bodily but in a [[spiritual]] way; not to sense, but to the [[mind]]; not in words that occupy [[time]], but, if i may so say, eternally, neither beginning to speak nor coming to an end. and what he says is accurately heard, not by the bodily but by the mental ear of his ministers and messengers, who are immortally blessed in the enjoyment[pg 404] of his unchangeable [[truth]]; and the directions which they in some ineffable way receive, they execute without delay or difficulty in the sensible and visible [[world]]. and this [[law]] was given in conformity with the [[age]] of the [[world]], and contained at the first earthly promises, as i have said, which, however, symbolized eternal ones; and these eternal blessings few understood, though many took a part in the celebration of their visible signs. nevertheless, with one [[consent]] both the words and the visible rites of that [[law]] enjoin the [[worship]] of one [[god]],—not one of a crowd of gods, but him who made [[heaven]] and [[earth]], and every [[soul]] and every spirit which is other than himself. he created; all else was created; and, both for being and well-being, all things need him who created them.

16. whether those angels who demand that we [[pay]] them [[divine]] [[honour]], or those who [[teach]] us to render holy service, not to themselves, but to [[god]], are to be trusted about the way to [[life]] eternal.

what angels, then, are we to [[believe]] in this matter of blessed and eternal [[life]]?—those who [[wish]] to be worshipped with [[religious]] rites and observances, and require that [[men]] [[sacrifice]] to them; or those who say that all this [[worship]] is due to one [[god]], the creator, and [[teach]] us to render it with true piety to him, by the vision of whom they are themselves already blessed, and in whom they promise that we shall be so? for that vision of [[god]] is the [[beauty]] of a vision so [[great]], and is so infinitely desirable, that plotinus does not hesitate to say that he who enjoys all other blessings in abundance, and has not this, is supremely miserable.[405] since, therefore, [[miracles]] are wrought by some angels to induce us to [[worship]] this [[god]], by others, to induce us to [[worship]] themselves; and since the former forbid us to [[worship]] these, while the latter dare not forbid us to [[worship]] [[god]], which are we to listen to? let the platonists reply, or any [[philosophers]], or the theurgists, or rather, periurgists,[406]—for this name is [[good]] enough for those who practise such [[arts]]. in short, let all [[men]] [[answer]],—if, at least, there survives in them any spark of that [[natural]] perception which, as [[rational]] beings, they possess when created,—let them, i say, tell us whether we should [[sacrifice]] to the gods or angels who[pg 405] order us to [[sacrifice]] to them, or to that one to whom we are ordered to [[sacrifice]] by those who forbid us to [[worship]] either themselves or these others. if neither the one party nor the other had wrought [[miracles]], but had merely uttered commands, the one to [[sacrifice]] to themselves, the other forbidding that, and ordering us to [[sacrifice]] to [[god]], a godly [[mind]] would have been at no loss to discern which command proceeded from proud arrogance, and which from true [[religion]]. i will say more. if [[miracles]] had been wrought only by those who demand [[sacrifice]] for themselves, while those who forbade this, and enjoined sacrificing to the one [[god]] only, [[thought]] fit entirely to forego the use of visible [[miracles]], the [[authority]] of the latter was to be preferred by all who would use, not their [[eyes]] only, but their [[reason]]. but since [[god]], for the sake of commending to us the oracles of his [[truth]], has, by means of these [[immortal]] messengers, who proclaim his majesty and not their own [[pride]], wrought [[miracles]] of surpassing grandeur, certainty, and distinctness, in order that the [[weak]] among the godly might not be drawn away to false [[religion]] by those who require us to [[sacrifice]] to them and endeavour to convince us by stupendous appeals to our senses, who is so utterly unreasonable as not to choose and [[follow]] the [[truth]], when he finds that it is heralded by even more striking evidences than falsehood?

as for those [[miracles]] which [[history]] ascribes to the gods of the heathen,—i do not refer to those prodigies which at intervals happen from some unknown physical causes, and which are arranged and appointed by [[divine]] providence, such as monstrous births, and unusual meteorological phenomena, whether startling only, or also injurious, and which are said to be brought about and removed by communication with demons, and by their most deceitful craft,—but i refer to these prodigies which manifestly enough are wrought by their [[power]] and [[force]], as, that the household gods which æneas carried from troy in his flight moved from place to place; that tarquin cut a whetstone with a razor; that the epidaurian serpent attached himself as a companion to æsculapius on his [[voyage]] to [[rome]]; that the ship in which the image of the phrygian [[mother]] stood, and which could not be moved by a host of [[men]] and oxen, was moved by one [[weak]] woman, who[pg 406] attached her girdle to the vessel and drew it, as proof of her chastity; that a vestal, whose virginity was questioned, removed the suspicion by carrying from the tiber a sieve full of water without any of it dropping: these, then, and the like, are by no means to be compared for greatness and [[virtue]] to those which, we [[read]], were wrought among god's [[people]]. how much less can we compare those marvels, which even the laws [[law]] of heathen nations prohibit and punish,—i mean the magical and theurgic marvels, of which the [[great]] part are merely illusions practised upon the senses, as the drawing down of the moon, "that," as lucan says, "it may shed a stronger influence on the plants?"[407] and if some of these do seem to [[equal]] those which are wrought by the godly, the end for which they are wrought distinguishes the two, and shows that ours are incomparably the more excellent. for those [[miracles]] commend the [[worship]] of a plurality of gods, who deserve [[worship]] the less the more they demand it; but these of ours commend the [[worship]] of the one [[god]], who, both by the testimony of his own scriptures [[scripture]], and by the eventual abolition of sacrifices [[sacrifice]], proves that he needs no such offerings. if, therefore, any angels demand [[sacrifice]] for themselves, we must prefer those who demand it, not for themselves, but for [[god]], the creator of all, whom they serve. for thus they prove how sincerely they [[love]] us, since they [[wish]] by [[sacrifice]] to [[subject]] us, not to themselves, but to him by the contemplation of whom they themselves are blessed, and to bring us to him from whom they themselves have never strayed. if, on the other hand, any angels [[wish]] us to [[sacrifice]], not to one, but to many, not, indeed, to themselves, but to the gods whose angels they are, we must in this case also prefer those who are the angels of the one [[god]] of gods, and who so bid us to [[worship]] him as to preclude our worshipping any other. but, further, if it be the case, as their [[pride]] and deceitfulness rather indicate, that they are neither [[good]] angels nor the angels of [[good]] gods, but wicked demons, who [[wish]] [[sacrifice]] to be paid, not to the one only and supreme [[god]], but to themselves, what [[better]] protection against them can we choose than that of the one [[god]] whom the [[good]] angels serve, the angels who bid us[pg 407] [[sacrifice]], not to themselves, but to him whose [[sacrifice]] we ourselves ought to be?

17. concerning the ark of the covenant, and the miraculous signs whereby [[god]] authenticated the [[law]] and the promise.

on this account it was that the [[law]] of [[god]], given by the disposition of angels, and which commanded that the one [[god]] of gods alone receive [[sacred]] [[worship]], to the exclusion of all others, was deposited in the ark, called the ark of the testimony. by this name it is sufficiently indicated, not that [[god]], who was worshipped by all those rites, was shut up and enclosed in that place, though his responses emanated from it along with signs appreciable by the senses, but that his will was declared from that [[throne]]. the [[law]] itself, too, was engraven on tables of stone, and, as i have said, deposited in the ark, which the priests [[priest]] carried with due reverence during the sojourn in the wilderness, along with the tabernacle, which was in like manner called the tabernacle of the testimony; and there was then an accompanying sign, which appeared as a cloud by day and as a [[fire]] by night; when the cloud moved, the camp was shifted, and where it stood the camp was pitched. besides these signs, and the voices which proceeded from the place where the ark was, there were other miraculous testimonies to the [[law]]. for when the ark was carried across jordan, on the entrance to the [[land]] of promise, the upper part of the river stopped in its course, and the lower part flowed on, so as to [[present]] both to the ark and the [[people]] dry ground to pass over. then, when it was carried seven times [[time]] round the first hostile and polytheistic [[city]] they came to, its walls suddenly fell down, though assaulted by no hand, struck by no battering-ram. afterwards, too, when they were now resident in the [[land]] of promise, and the ark had, in [[punishment]] of their [[sin]], been taken by their enemies [[enemy]], its captors triumphantly placed it in the temple of their favourite [[god]], and left it shut up there, but, on opening the temple next day, they found the image they used to [[pray]] to fallen to the ground and shamefully shattered. then, being themselves alarmed by portents, and still more shamefully punished, they restored the ark of the testimony to the [[people]] from whom they had taken it. and what was the manner of[pg 408] its restoration? they placed it on a wagon, and yoked to it cows from which they had taken the calves, and let them choose their own course, expecting that in this way the [[divine]] will would be indicated; and the cows, without any [[man]] driving or directing them, steadily pursued the way to the hebrews, without regarding the lowing of their calves, and thus restored the ark to its worshippers. to [[god]] these and such like wonders are small, but they are mighty to terrify and give wholesome instruction to [[men]]. for if [[philosophers]], and especially the platonists, are with [[justice]] esteemed wiser than other [[men]], as i have just been mentioning, because they taught that even these earthly and insignificant things are ruled by [[divine]] providence, inferring this from the numberless beauties [[beauty]] which are observable not only in the bodies [[body]] of animals, but even in plants and grasses, how much more plainly do these things attest the presence of divinity which happen at the [[time]] predicted, and in which that [[religion]] is commended which forbids the offering of [[sacrifice]] to any celestial, terrestrial, or infernal being, and commands it to be offered to [[god]] only, who alone blesses us by his [[love]] for us, and by our [[love]] to him, and who, by arranging the appointed times [[time]] of those sacrifices [[sacrifice]], and by predicting that they were to pass into a [[better]] [[sacrifice]] by a [[better]] [[priest]], testified that he has no appetite for these sacrifices [[sacrifice]], but through them indicated others of more substantial blessing,—and all this not that he himself may be glorified by these honours [[honour]], but that we may be stirred up to [[worship]] and cleave to him, being inflamed by his [[love]], which is our advantage rather than his?

18. against those who deny that the books [[book]] of the [[church]] are to be believed about the [[miracles]] whereby the [[people]] of [[god]] were educated.

will some one say that these [[miracles]] are false, that they never happened, and that the records of them are lies [[lie]]? whoever says so, and asserts that in such matters no records whatever can be credited, may also say that there are no gods who [[care]] for [[human]] affairs. for they have induced [[men]] to [[worship]] them only by means of miraculous works [[work]], which the heathen histories [[history]] testify, and by which the gods have made a display of their own [[power]] rather than done any real service. this is the [[reason]] why we have not undertaken in this [[work]],[pg 409] of which we are now writing the tenth [[book]], to refute those who either deny that there is any [[divine]] [[power]], or contend that it does not interfere with [[human]] affairs, but those who prefer their own [[god]] to our [[god]], the founder of the holy and most glorious [[city]], not knowing that he is also the invisible and unchangeable founder of this visible and changing [[world]], and the truest bestower of the blessed [[life]] which resides not in things created, but in himself. for thus speaks his most trustworthy [[prophet]]: "it is [[good]] for me to be [[united]] to [[god]]."[408] among [[philosophers]] it is a [[question]], what is that end and [[good]] to the attainment of which all our duties [[duty]] are to have a relation? the psalmist did not say, it is [[good]] for me to have [[great]] [[wealth]], or to wear imperial insignia, purple, sceptre, and diadem; or, as some even of the [[philosophers]] have not blushed to say, it is [[good]] for me to enjoy sensual [[pleasure]]; or, as the [[better]] [[men]] among them seemed to say, my [[good]] is my [[spiritual]] [[strength]]; but, "it is [[good]] for me to be [[united]] to [[god]]." this he had learned from him whom the holy angels, with the accompanying witness of [[miracles]], presented as the sole object of [[worship]]. and hence he himself became the [[sacrifice]] of [[god]], whose [[spiritual]] [[love]] inflamed him, and into whose ineffable and incorporeal embrace he yearned to cast himself. moreover, if the worshippers of many gods (whatever [[kind]] of gods they fancy their own to be) [[believe]] that the [[miracles]] recorded in their civil histories [[history]], or in the books [[book]] of magic, or of the more respectable theurgy, were wrought by these gods, what [[reason]] have they for refusing to [[believe]] the [[miracles]] recorded in those writings, to which we owe a credence as much greater as he is greater to whom alone these writings [[teach]] us to [[sacrifice]]?

19. on the reasonableness of offering, as the true [[religion]] teaches [[teach]], a visible [[sacrifice]] to the one true and invisible [[god]].

as to those who [[think]] that these visible sacrifices [[sacrifice]] are suitably offered to other gods, but that invisible sacrifices [[sacrifice]], the graces of purity of [[mind]] and holiness of will, should be offered, as greater and [[better]], to the invisible [[god]], himself greater and [[better]] than all others, they must be oblivious that these visible sacrifices [[sacrifice]] are signs of the invisible, as the words we[pg 410] utter are the signs of things. and therefore, as in prayer or [[praise]] we direct intelligible words to him to whom in our [[heart]] we offer the very feelings we are expressing, so we are to [[understand]] that in [[sacrifice]] we offer visible [[sacrifice]] only to him to whom in our [[heart]] we ought to [[present]] ourselves an invisible [[sacrifice]]. it is then that the angels, and all those superior powers [[power]] who are mighty by their goodness and piety, regard us with [[pleasure]], and rejoice with us and assist us to the utmost of their [[power]]. but if we offer such [[worship]] to them, they decline it; and when on any mission to [[men]] they become visible to the senses, they positively forbid it. examples [[example]] of this occur in holy writ. some fancied they should, by adoration or [[sacrifice]], [[pay]] the same [[honour]] to angels as is due to [[god]], and were prevented from doing so by the angels themselves, and ordered to render it to him to whom alone they [[know]] it to be due. and the holy angels have in this been imitated by holy [[men]] of [[god]]. for paul and barnabas, when they had wrought a miracle of healing in lycaonia, were [[thought]] to be gods, and the lycaonians [[desired]] to [[sacrifice]] to them, and they humbly and piously declined this [[honour]], and announced to them the [[god]] in whom they should [[believe]]. and those deceitful and proud spirits, who exact [[worship]], do so simply because they [[know]] it to be due to the true [[god]]. for that which they take [[pleasure]] in is not, as porphyry says and some fancy, the smell of the victims, but [[divine]] honours [[honour]]. they have, in [[fact]], plenty odours on all hands, and if they wished more, they could provide them for themselves. but the spirits who arrogate to themselves divinity are delighted not with the smoke of carcases, but with the suppliant spirit which they [[deceive]] and hold in subjection, and hinder from drawing near to [[god]], preventing him from offering himself in [[sacrifice]] to [[god]] by inducing him to [[sacrifice]] to others.

20. of the supreme and true [[sacrifice]] which was effected by the mediator between [[god]] and [[men]].

and hence that true mediator, in so far as, by assuming the form of a servant, he became the mediator between [[god]] and [[men]], the [[man]] [[christ]] [[jesus]], though in the form of [[god]] he received [[sacrifice]] together with the [[father]], with whom he is one [[god]], yet in the form of a servant he chose rather to[pg 411] be than to receive a [[sacrifice]], that not even by this instance any one might have [[occasion]] to suppose that [[sacrifice]] should be rendered to any creature. thus he is both the [[priest]] who offers and the [[sacrifice]] offered. and he designed that there should be a daily sign of this in the [[sacrifice]] of the [[church]], which, being his [[body]], learns to offer herself through him. of this true [[sacrifice]] the ancient sacrifices [[sacrifice]] of the saints were the various and numerous signs; and it was thus variously figured, just as one thing is signified by a variety of words, that there may be less weariness when we speak of it much. to this supreme and true [[sacrifice]] all false sacrifices [[sacrifice]] have given place.

21. of the [[power]] delegated to demons for the [[trial]] and glorification of the saints, who conquer not by propitiating the spirits of the air, but by abiding in [[god]].

the [[power]] delegated to the demons at [[certain]] appointed and well-adjusted seasons, that they may give expression to their hostility to the [[city]] of [[god]] by stirring up against it the [[men]] who are under their influence, and may not only receive [[sacrifice]] from those who willingly offer it, but may also extort it from the unwilling by [[violent]] persecution;—this [[power]] is found to be not merely harmless, but even useful to the [[church]], completing as it does the number of martyrs, whom the [[city]] of [[god]] esteems as all the more illustrious and honoured [[citizens]], because they have striven even to [[blood]] against the [[sin]] of impiety. if the ordinary [[language]] of the [[church]] allowed it, we might more elegantly call these [[men]] our heroes. for this name is said to be derived from juno, who in [[greek]] is called hêrê, and hence, according to the [[greek]] myths, one of her sons [[son]] was called heros. and these fables mystically signified that juno was mistress of the air, which they suppose to be inhabited by the demons and the heroes, understanding by heroes the souls [[soul]] of the well-deserving [[dead]]. but for a quite opposite [[reason]] would we call our martyrs heroes,—supposing, as i said, that the usage of ecclesiastical [[language]] would admit of it,—not because they lived along with the demons in the air, but because they conquered these demons or powers [[power]] of the air, and among them juno herself, be she what she may, not[pg 412] unsuitably represented, as she commonly is by the poets, as hostile to [[virtue]], and [[jealous]] of [[men]] of mark aspiring to the heavens [[heaven]]. [[virgil]], however, unhappily gives way, and yields to her; for, though he represents her as saying, "i am conquered by æneas,"[409] helenus gives æneas himself this [[religious]] [[advice]]:

"pay vows to juno: overbear her queenly [[soul]] with gift and prayer."[410]
in conformity with this [[opinion]], porphyry—expressing, however, not so much his own views as other people's—says that a [[good]] [[god]] or genius cannot come to a [[man]] unless the [[evil]] genius has been first of all propitiated, implying that the [[evil]] deities had greater [[power]] than the [[good]]; for, until they have been appeased and give place, the [[good]] can give no assistance; and if the [[evil]] deities oppose, the [[good]] can give no [[help]]; whereas the [[evil]] can do injury without the [[good]] being able to prevent them. this is not the way of the true and truly holy [[religion]]; not thus do our martyrs conquer juno, that is to say, the powers [[power]] of the air, who envy the virtues [[virtue]] of the pious. our heroes, if we could so call them, overcome hêrê, not by suppliant gifts, but by [[divine]] virtues [[virtue]]. as scipio, who conquered [[africa]] by his valour, is more suitably styled africanus than if he had appeased his enemies [[enemy]] by gifts, and so won their [[mercy]].

22. whence the saints derive [[power]] against demons and true purification of [[heart]].

it is by true piety that [[men]] of [[god]] cast out the hostile [[power]] of the air which opposes godliness; it is by exorcising it, not by propitiating it; and they overcome all the temptations of the adversary by praying, not to him, but to their own [[god]] against him. for the [[devil]] cannot conquer or subdue any but those who are in league with [[sin]]; and therefore he is conquered in the name of him who assumed [[humanity]], and that without [[sin]], that himself being both [[priest]] and [[sacrifice]], he might bring about the remission of sins [[sin]], that is to say, might bring it about through the mediator between [[god]] and [[men]], the [[man]] [[christ]] [[jesus]], by whom we are reconciled to [[god]], the cleansing from [[sin]] being accomplished.[pg 413] for [[men]] are separated from [[god]] only by sins [[sin]], from which we are in this [[life]] cleansed not by our own [[virtue]], but by the [[divine]] compassion; through his indulgence, not through our own [[power]]. for, whatever [[virtue]] we call our own is itself bestowed upon us by his goodness. and we might attribute too much to ourselves while in the flesh, unless we lived in the receipt of pardon until we laid it down. this is the [[reason]] why there has been vouchsafed to us, through the mediator, this grace, that we who are polluted by sinful flesh should be cleansed by the likeness of sinful flesh. by this grace of [[god]], wherein he has shown his [[great]] compassion toward us, we are both governed by [[faith]] in this [[life]], and, after this [[life]], are [[led]] onwards to the fullest [[perfection]] by the vision of immutable [[truth]].

23. of the principles [[principle]] which, according to the platonists, regulate the purification of the [[soul]].

even porphyry asserts that it was revealed by [[divine]] oracles that we are not purified by any sacrifices[411] to sun or moon, meaning it to be inferred that we are not purified by sacrificing to any gods. for what mysteries can purify, if those of the sun and moon, which are esteemed the [[chief]] of the celestial gods, do not purify? he says, too, in the same place, that "principles" can purify, lest it should be supposed, from his saying that sacrificing to the sun and moon cannot purify, that sacrificing to some other of the host of gods might do so. and what he as a platonist means by "principles," we [[know]].[412] for he speaks of [[god]] the [[father]] and [[god]] the [[son]], whom he calls (writing in greek) the [[intellect]] or [[mind]] of the [[father]];[413] but of the holy spirit he says either nothing, or nothing plainly, for i do not [[understand]] what other he speaks of as holding the middle place between these two.[pg 414] for if, like plotinus in his discussion regarding the three principal substances,[414] he wished us to [[understand]] by this third the [[soul]] of [[nature]], he would certainly not have given it the middle place between these two, that is, between the [[father]] and the [[son]]. for plotinus places the [[soul]] of [[nature]] after the [[intellect]] of the [[father]], while porphyry, making it the mean, does not place it after, but between the others. no [[doubt]] he spoke according to his [[light]], or as he [[thought]] expedient; but we assert that the holy spirit is the spirit not of the [[father]] only, nor of the [[son]] only, but of both. for [[philosophers]] speak as they have a [[mind]] to, and in the most difficult matters do not scruple to offend [[religious]] ears; but we are bound to speak according to a [[certain]] [[rule]], lest [[freedom]] of [[speech]] beget impiety of [[opinion]] about the matters themselves of which we speak.

24. of the one only true [[principle]] which alone purifies and renews [[human]] [[nature]].

accordingly, when we speak of [[god]], we do not affirm two or three principles [[principle]], no more than we are at [[liberty]] to affirm two or three gods; although, speaking of each, of the [[father]], or of the [[son]], or of the holy ghost, we confess that each is [[god]]: and yet we do not say, as the sabellian heretics say, that the [[father]] is the same as the [[son]], and the holy spirit the same as the [[father]] and the [[son]]; but we say that the [[father]] is the [[father]] of the [[son]], and the [[son]] the [[son]] of the [[father]], and that the holy spirit of the [[father]] and the [[son]] is neither the [[father]] nor the [[son]]. it was therefore truly said that [[man]] is cleansed only by a [[principle]], although the platonists erred in speaking in the plural of principles [[principle]]. but porphyry, being under the dominion of these envious powers [[power]], whose influence he was at once ashamed of and afraid to throw off, refused to recognise that [[christ]] is the [[principle]] by whose incarnation we are purified. indeed he despised him, because of the flesh itself which he assumed, that he might offer a [[sacrifice]] for our purification,—a [[great]] mystery, unintelligible to porphyry's [[pride]], which that true and benignant redeemer brought low by his [[humility]], manifesting himself to mortals by the [[mortality]] which he assumed, and which[pg 415] the malignant and deceitful mediators are proud of wanting, promising, as the boon of immortals [[immortal]], a deceptive assistance to wretched [[men]]. thus the [[good]] and true mediator showed that it is [[sin]] which is [[evil]], and not the substance or [[nature]] of flesh; for this, together with the [[human]] [[soul]], could without [[sin]] be both assumed and retained, and laid down in [[death]], and changed to something [[better]] by resurrection. he showed also that [[death]] itself, although the [[punishment]] of [[sin]], was submitted to by him for our sakes without [[sin]], and must not be evaded by [[sin]] on our part, but rather, if opportunity serves, be borne for righteousness' sake. for he was able to expiate sins [[sin]] by dying, because he both died, and not for [[sin]] of his own. but he has not been recognised by porphyry as the [[principle]], otherwise he would have recognised him as the purifier. the [[principle]] is neither the flesh nor the [[human]] [[soul]] in [[christ]], but the word by which all things were made. the flesh, therefore, does not by its own [[virtue]] purify, but by [[virtue]] of the word by which it was assumed, when "the word became flesh and dwelt among us."[415] for, speaking mystically of eating his flesh, when those who did not [[understand]] him were offended and went away, saying, "this is an hard saying, who can hear it?" he answered to the rest who remained, "it is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing."[416] the [[principle]], therefore, having assumed a [[human]] [[soul]] and flesh, cleanses the [[soul]] and flesh of believers. therefore, when the [[jews]] [[asked]] him who he was, he answered that he was the [[principle]].[417] and this we carnal and feeble [[men]], liable to [[sin]], and involved in the darkness of ignorance, could not possibly [[understand]], unless we were cleansed and healed by him, both by means of what we were, and of what we were not. for we were [[men]], but we were not righteous; whereas in his incarnation there was a [[human]] [[nature]], but it was righteous, and not sinful. this is the mediation whereby a hand is stretched to the lapsed and fallen; this is the seed "ordained by angels," by whose ministry the [[law]] also was given enjoining the [[worship]] of one [[god]], and promising that this mediator should come.

[pg 416]

25. that all the saints, both under the [[law]] and before it, were justified by [[faith]] in the mystery of christ's incarnation.

it was by [[faith]] in this mystery, and godliness of [[life]], that purification was attainable even by the saints of old, whether before the [[law]] was given to the hebrews (for [[god]] and the angels were even then [[present]] as instructors), or in the periods under the [[law]], although the promises of [[spiritual]] things, being presented in figure, seemed to be carnal, and hence the name of old testament. for it was then the prophets [[prophet]] lived, by whom, as by angels, the same promise was announced; and among them was he whose grand and [[divine]] sentiment regarding the end and supreme [[good]] of [[man]] i have just now quoted, "it is [[good]] for me to cleave to [[god]]."[418] in this psalm the distinction between the old and new testaments is distinctly announced. for the psalmist says, that when he saw that the carnal and earthly promises were abundantly enjoyed by the ungodly, his feet were almost gone, his steps had well-nigh slipped; and that it seemed to him as if he had served [[god]] in [[vain]], when he saw that those who despised [[god]] increased in that [[prosperity]] which he looked for at god's hand. he says, too, that, in investigating this matter with the [[desire]] of understanding why it was so, he had laboured in [[vain]], until he went into the sanctuary of [[god]], and understood the end of those whom he had erroneously considered [[happy]]. then he understood that they were cast down by that very thing, as he says, which they had made their boast, and that they had been consumed and perished for their iniquities; and that that whole fabric of temporal [[prosperity]] had become as a [[dream]] when one awaketh, and suddenly finds himself destitute of all the joys he had imaged in sleep. and, as in this [[earth]] or earthy [[city]] they seemed to themselves to be [[great]], he says, "o [[lord]], in thy [[city]] thou wilt reduce their image to nothing." he also shows how beneficial it had been for him to seek even earthly blessings only from the one true [[god]], in whose [[power]] are all things, for he says, "as a beast was i before thee, and i am always with thee." "as a beast," he says, meaning that he was stupid. for i ought to have sought from thee such things as the ungodly could[pg 417] not enjoy as well as i, and not those things which i saw them enjoying in abundance, and hence concluded i was serving thee in [[vain]], because they who declined to serve thee had what i had not. nevertheless, "i am always with thee," because even in my [[desire]] for such things i did not [[pray]] to other gods. and consequently he goes on, "thou hast holden me by my [[right]] hand, and by thy counsel thou hast guided me, and with [[glory]] hast taken me up;" as if all earthly advantages were left-hand blessings, though, when he saw them enjoyed by the wicked, his feet had almost gone. "for what," he says, "have i in [[heaven]], and what have i [[desired]] from thee upon [[earth]]?" he blames himself, and is justly displeased with himself; because, though he had in [[heaven]] so vast a possession (as he afterwards understood), he yet sought from his [[god]] on [[earth]] a transitory and fleeting [[happiness]],—a [[happiness]] of mire, we may say. "my [[heart]] and my flesh," he says, "fail, o [[god]] of my [[heart]]." [[happy]] failure, from things below to things above! and hence in another psalm he says, "my [[soul]] longeth, yea, even faileth, for the courts of the [[lord]]."[419] yet, though he had said of both his [[heart]] and his flesh that they were failing, he did not say, o [[god]] of my [[heart]] and my flesh, but, o [[god]] of my [[heart]]; for by the [[heart]] the flesh is made clean. therefore, says the [[lord]], "cleanse that which is within, and the outside shall be clean also."[420] he then says that [[god]] himself,—not anything received from him, but himself,—is his portion. "the [[god]] of my [[heart]], and my portion for ever." among the various objects of [[human]] [[choice]], [[god]] alone satisfied him. "for, lo," he says, "they that are far from thee shall perish: thou destroyest all them that go a-whoring from thee,"—that is, who prostitute themselves to many gods. and then follows the verse for which all the rest of the psalm seems to prepare: "it is [[good]] for me to cleave to [[god]],"—not to go far off; not to go a-whoring with a multitude of gods. and then shall this union with [[god]] be perfected, when all that is to be redeemed in us has been redeemed. but for the [[present]] we must, as he goes on to say, "place our [[hope]] in [[god]]." "for that which is seen," says the apostle, "is not [[hope]]. for what[pg 418] a [[man]] sees, why does he yet [[hope]] for? but if we [[hope]] for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."[421] being, then, for the [[present]] established in this [[hope]], let us do what the psalmist further indicates, and become in our measure angels or messengers of [[god]], declaring his will, and praising his [[glory]] and his grace. for when he had said, "to place my [[hope]] in [[god]]," he goes on, "that i may declare all thy praises [[praise]] in the gates of the [[daughter]] of zion." this is the most glorious [[city]] of [[god]]; this is the [[city]] which knows [[know]] and worships one [[god]]: she is celebrated by the holy angels, who invite us to their [[society]], and [[desire]] us to become fellow-citizens with them in this [[city]]; for they do not [[wish]] us to [[worship]] them as our gods, but to join them in worshipping their [[god]] and ours; nor to [[sacrifice]] to them, but, together with them, to become a [[sacrifice]] to [[god]]. accordingly, whoever will lay aside malignant obstinacy, and consider these things, shall be assured that all these blessed and [[immortal]] spirits, who do not envy us (for if they envied they were not blessed), but rather [[love]] us, and [[desire]] us to be as blessed as themselves, look on us with greater [[pleasure]], and give us greater assistance, when we join them in worshipping one [[god]], [[father]], [[son]], and holy ghost, than if we were to offer to themselves [[sacrifice]] and [[worship]].

26. of porphyry's weakness in wavering between the [[confession]] of the true [[god]] and the [[worship]] of demons.

i [[know]] not how it is so, but it seems to me that porphyry blushed for his [[friends]] the theurgists; for he knew all that i have adduced, but did not frankly condemn polytheistic [[worship]]. he said, in [[fact]], that there are some angels who visit [[earth]], and reveal [[divine]] [[truth]] to theurgists, and others who publish on [[earth]] the things that belong to the [[father]], his height and depth. can we [[believe]], then, that the angels whose office it is to declare the will of the [[father]], [[wish]] us to be [[subject]] to any but him whose will they declare? and hence, even this platonist himself judiciously observes that we should rather imitate than invoke them. we ought not, then, to [[fear]] that we may offend these [[immortal]] and [[happy]] subjects[pg 419] of the one [[god]] by not sacrificing to them; for this they [[know]] to be due only to the one true [[god]], in allegiance to whom they themselves find their blessedness, and therefore they will not have it given to them, either in figure or in the reality, which the mysteries of [[sacrifice]] symbolized. such arrogance belongs to proud and wretched demons, whose disposition is diametrically opposite to the piety of those who are [[subject]] to [[god]], and whose blessedness consists in attachment to him. and, that we also may attain to this bliss, they aid us, as is fit, with sincere kindliness, and usurp over us no dominion, but declare to us him under whose [[rule]] we are then fellow-subjects. why, then, o philosopher, do you still [[fear]] to speak freely against the powers [[power]] which are inimical both to true [[virtue]] and to the gifts of the true [[god]]? already you have discriminated between the angels who proclaim god's will, and those who visit theurgists, drawn down by i [[know]] not what art [[arts]]. why do you still ascribe to these latter the [[honour]] of declaring [[divine]] [[truth]]? if they do not declare the will of the [[father]], what [[divine]] revelations can they make? are not these the [[evil]] spirits who were bound over by the incantations of an envious [[man]],[422] that they should not grant purity of [[soul]] to another, and could not, as you say, be set [[free]] from these bonds by a [[good]] [[man]] anxious for purity, and recover [[power]] over their own actions? do you still [[doubt]] whether these are wicked demons; or do you, perhaps, feign ignorance, that you may not give offence to the theurgists, who have allured you by their secret rites, and have taught you, as a mighty boon, these insane and pernicious devilries? do you dare to elevate above the air, and even to [[heaven]], these envious powers [[power]], or pests, let me rather call them, less worthy of the name of [[sovereign]] than of slaves [[slave]], as you yourself own; and are you not ashamed to place them even among your sidereal gods, and so put a slight upon the stars themselves?

27. of the impiety of porphyry, which is worse than even the mistake of apuleius.

how much more tolerable and accordant with [[human]] feeling is the error of your platonist co-sectary apuleius! for he[pg 420] attributed the diseases and storms of [[human]] [[passions]] only to the demons who occupy a grade beneath the moon, and makes even this avowal as by constraint regarding gods whom he honours [[honour]]; but the superior and celestial gods, who inhabit the ethereal regions, whether visible, as the sun, moon, and other luminaries, whose brilliancy makes them conspicuous, or invisible, but believed in by him, he does his utmost to remove beyond the slightest stain of these perturbations. it is not, then, from [[plato]], but from your chaldæan teachers you have learned to elevate [[human]] vices [[vice]] to the ethereal and empyreal regions of the [[world]] and to the celestial firmament, in order that your theurgists might be able to obtain from your gods [[divine]] revelations; and yet you make yourself superior to these [[divine]] revelations by your intellectual [[life]], which dispenses with these theurgic purifications as not needed by a philosopher. but, by way of rewarding your teachers, you recommend these [[arts]] to other [[men]], who, not being [[philosophers]], may be persuaded to use what you acknowledge to be useless to yourself, who are capable of higher things; so that those who cannot avail themselves of the [[virtue]] of [[philosophy]], which is too arduous for the multitude, may, at your instigation, betake themselves to theurgists by whom they may be purified, not, indeed, in the intellectual, but in the [[spiritual]] part of the [[soul]]. now, as the persons [[person]] who are unfit for [[philosophy]] form incomparably the majority of [[mankind]], more may be compelled to consult these secret and illicit teachers of yours than frequent the platonic schools. for these most impure demons, pretending to be ethereal gods, whose herald and messenger you have become, have promised that those who are purified by theurgy in the [[spiritual]] part of their [[soul]] shall not indeed return to the [[father]], but shall dwell among the ethereal gods above the aerial regions. but such fancies are not listened to by the multitudes of [[men]] whom [[christ]] came to set [[free]] from the [[tyranny]] of demons. for in him they have the most gracious cleansing, in which [[mind]], spirit, and [[body]] alike participate. for, in order that he might heal the whole [[man]] from the plague of [[sin]], he took without [[sin]] the whole [[human]] [[nature]]. would that you had known him, and would that you had committed yourself[pg 421] for healing to him rather than to your own frail and infirm [[human]] [[virtue]], or to pernicious and [[curious]] arts! he would not have deceived you; for him your own oracles, on your own showing, acknowledged holy and [[immortal]]. it is of him, too, that the most famous poet speaks, poetically indeed, since he applies it to the [[person]] of another, yet truly, if you refer it to [[christ]], saying, "under thine auspices, if any traces of our crimes remain, they shall be obliterated, and [[earth]] freed from its perpetual [[fear]]."[423] by which he indicates that, by [[reason]] of the infirmity which attaches to this [[life]], the [[greatest]] [[progress]] in [[virtue]] and [[righteousness]] leaves room for the existence, if not of crimes, yet of the traces of crimes, which are obliterated only by that saviour of whom this verse speaks. for that he did not say this at the prompting of his own fancy, [[virgil]] tells us in almost the [[last]] verse of that 4th eclogue, when he says, "the [[last]] [[age]] predicted by the cumæan sibyl has now arrived;" whence it plainly appears that this had been dictated by the cumæan sibyl. but those theurgists, or rather demons, who assume the appearance and form of gods, pollute rather than purify the [[human]] spirit by false appearances and the delusive mockery of unsubstantial forms. how can those whose own spirit is unclean cleanse the spirit of [[man]]? were they not unclean, they would not be bound by the incantations of an envious [[man]], and would neither be afraid nor grudge to bestow that hollow boon which they promise. but it is sufficient for our [[purpose]] that you acknowledge that the intellectual [[soul]], that is, our [[mind]], cannot be justified by theurgy; and that even the [[spiritual]] or inferior part of our [[soul]] cannot by this act be made eternal and [[immortal]], though you maintain that it can be purified by it. [[christ]], however, promises [[life]] eternal; and therefore to him the [[world]] flocks, greatly to your indignation, greatly also to your astonishment and confusion. what avails your forced avowal that theurgy leads [[men]] astray, and deceives vast numbers by its ignorant and foolish teaching, and that it is the most manifest mistake to have recourse by prayer and [[sacrifice]] to angels and principalities, when at the same [[time]], to save yourself from the charge of spending [[labour]] in [[vain]] on such [[arts]], you direct[pg 422] [[men]] to the theurgists, that by their means [[men]], who do not [[live]] by the [[rule]] of the intellectual [[soul]], may have their [[spiritual]] [[soul]] purified?

28. how it is that porphyry has been so blind as not to recognise the true wisdom—christ.

you drive [[men]], therefore, into the most palpable error. and yet you are not ashamed of doing so much harm, though you call yourself a lover of [[virtue]] and [[wisdom]]. had you been true and faithful in this profession, you would have recognised [[christ]], the [[virtue]] of [[god]] and the [[wisdom]] of [[god]], and would not, in the [[pride]] of [[vain]] [[science]], have revolted from his wholesome [[humility]]. nevertheless you acknowledge that the [[spiritual]] part of the [[soul]] can be purified by the [[virtue]] of chastity without the aid of those theurgic [[arts]] and mysteries which you wasted your [[time]] in learning. you even say, sometimes, that these mysteries do not raise the [[soul]] after [[death]], so that, after the termination of this [[life]], they seem to be of no service even to the part you call [[spiritual]]; and yet you recur on every opportunity to these [[arts]], for no other [[purpose]], so far as i see, than to appear an accomplished theurgist, and gratify those who are [[curious]] in illicit [[arts]], or else to inspire others with the same curiosity. but we give you all [[praise]] for saying that this art [[arts]] is to be feared, both on account of the legal enactments against it, and by [[reason]] of the danger involved in the very practice of it. and would that in this, at least, you were listened to by its wretched votaries, that they might be withdrawn from entire absorption in it, or might even be preserved from tampering with it at all! you say, indeed, that ignorance, and the numberless vices [[vice]] resulting from it, cannot be removed by any mysteries, but only by the πατρικὸς νοῦς, that is, the father's [[mind]] or [[intellect]] conscious of the father's will. but that [[christ]] is this [[mind]] you do not [[believe]]; for him you despise on account of the [[body]] he took of a woman and the shame of the cross; for your lofty [[wisdom]] spurns such low and contemptible things, and soars to more exalted regions. but he fulfils what the holy prophets [[prophet]] truly predicted regarding him: "i will [[destroy]] the [[wisdom]] of the [[wise]], and bring to nought the prudence of the prudent."[pg 423][424] for he does not [[destroy]] and bring to nought his own gift in them, but what they arrogate to themselves, and do not hold of him. and hence the apostle, having quoted this testimony from the [[prophet]], adds, "where is the [[wise]]? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this [[world]]? hath not [[god]] made foolish the [[wisdom]] of this [[world]]? for after that, in the [[wisdom]] of [[god]], the [[world]] by [[wisdom]] knew not [[god]], it pleased [[god]] by the foolishness of preaching to save them that [[believe]]. for the [[jews]] require a sign, and the greeks [[greek]] seek after [[wisdom]]; but we preach [[christ]] crucified, unto the [[jews]] a stumbling-block, and unto the greeks [[greek]] foolishness; but unto them which are called, both [[jews]] and greeks [[greek]], [[christ]] the [[power]] of [[god]], and the [[wisdom]] of [[god]]. because the foolishness of [[god]] is wiser than [[men]]; and the weakness of [[god]] is stronger than [[men]]."[425] this is despised as a [[weak]] and foolish thing by those who are [[wise]] and [[strong]] in themselves; yet this is the grace which heals the [[weak]], who do not proudly boast a blessedness of their own, but rather humbly acknowledge their real misery.

29. of the incarnation of our [[lord]] [[jesus]] [[christ]], which the platonists in their impiety blush to acknowledge.

you proclaim the [[father]] and his [[son]], whom you call the father's [[intellect]] or [[mind]], and between these a third, by whom we suppose you mean the holy spirit, and in your own [[fashion]] you call these three gods. in this, though your expressions are inaccurate, you do in some sort, and as through a veil, see what we should strive towards; but the incarnation of the unchangeable [[son]] of [[god]], whereby we are saved, and are enabled to reach the things we [[believe]], or in part [[understand]], this is what you refuse to recognise. you see in a [[fashion]], although at a distance, although with filmy eye, the [[country]] in which we should abide; but the way to it you [[know]] not. yet you [[believe]] in grace, for you say it is granted to few to reach [[god]] by [[virtue]] of [[intelligence]]. for you do not say, "few have [[thought]] fit or have wished," but, "it has been granted to few,"—distinctly acknowledging god's grace, not man's [[man]] sufficiency. you also use this word more expressly, when, in[pg 424] accordance with the [[opinion]] of [[plato]], you make no [[doubt]] that in this [[life]] a [[man]] cannot by any means attain to [[perfect]] [[wisdom]], but that whatever is lacking is in the future [[life]] made up to those who [[live]] intellectually, by god's providence and grace. oh, had you but recognised the grace of [[god]] in [[jesus]] [[christ]] our [[lord]], and that very incarnation of his, wherein he assumed a [[human]] [[soul]] and [[body]], you might have seemed the brightest [[example]] of grace![426] but what am i doing? i [[know]] it is useless to speak to a [[dead]] [[man]],—useless, at least, so far as regards you, but perhaps not in [[vain]] for those who esteem you highly, and [[love]] you on account of their [[love]] of [[wisdom]] or curiosity about those [[arts]] which you ought not to have learned; and these persons [[person]] i address in your name. the grace of [[god]] could not have been more graciously commended to us than thus, that the only [[son]] of [[god]], remaining unchangeable in himself, should assume [[humanity]], and should give us the [[hope]] of his [[love]], by means of the mediation of a [[human]] [[nature]], through which we, from the condition of [[men]], might come to him who was so far off,—the [[immortal]] from the mortal; the unchangeable from the changeable; the just from the [[unjust]]; the blessed from the wretched. and, as he had given us a [[natural]] instinct to [[desire]] blessedness and immortality, he himself continuing to be blessed, but assuming [[mortality]], by enduring what we [[fear]], taught us to despise it, that what we long for he might bestow upon us.

but in order to your acquiescence in this [[truth]], it is lowliness that is requisite, and to this it is extremely difficult to bend you. for what is there incredible, especially to [[men]] like you, accustomed to speculation, which might have predisposed you to [[believe]] in this,—what is there incredible, i say, in the assertion that [[god]] assumed a [[human]] [[soul]] and [[body]]? you yourselves ascribe such excellence to the intellectual [[soul]], which is, after all, the [[human]] [[soul]], that you maintain that it can become consubstantial with that [[intelligence]] of the [[father]] whom you [[believe]] in as the [[son]] of [[god]]. what incredible thing is it, then, if some one [[soul]] be assumed by him in an ineffable and unique manner for the salvation of many?[pg 425] moreover, our [[nature]] itself testifies that a [[man]] is incomplete unless a [[body]] be [[united]] with the [[soul]]. this certainly would be more incredible, were it not of all things the most [[common]]; for we should more easily [[believe]] in a union between spirit and spirit, or, to use your own terminology, between the incorporeal and the incorporeal, even though the one were [[human]], the other [[divine]], the one changeable and the other unchangeable, than in a union between the corporeal and the incorporeal. but perhaps it is the unprecedented birth of a [[body]] from a virgin that staggers you? but, so far from this being a difficulty, it ought rather to assist you to receive our [[religion]], that a miraculous [[person]] was born miraculously. or, do you find a difficulty in the [[fact]] that, after his [[body]] had been given up to [[death]], and had been changed into a higher [[kind]] of [[body]] by resurrection, and was now no longer mortal but incorruptible, he carried it up into heavenly places? perhaps you refuse to [[believe]] this, because you [[remember]] that porphyry, in these very books [[book]] from which i have cited so much, and which treat of the return of the [[soul]], so frequently teaches [[teach]] that a [[body]] of every [[kind]] is to be escaped from, in order that the [[soul]] may dwell in blessedness with [[god]]. but here, in place of following porphyry, you ought rather to have corrected him, especially since you agree with him in believing such incredible things about the [[soul]] of this visible [[world]] and huge material frame. for, as scholars of [[plato]], you hold that the [[world]] is an animal, and a very [[happy]] animal, which you [[wish]] to be also everlasting. how, then, is it never to be loosed from a [[body]], and yet never lose its [[happiness]], if, in order to the [[happiness]] of the [[soul]], the [[body]] must be left behind? the sun, too, and the other stars, you not only acknowledge to be bodies [[body]], in which you have the cordial assent of all seeing [[men]], but also, in [[obedience]] to what you reckon a profounder insight, you declare that they are very blessed animals, and eternal, together with their bodies [[body]]. why is it, then, that when the [[christian]] [[faith]] is pressed upon you, you forget, or pretend to ignore, what you habitually discuss or [[teach]]? why is it that you refuse to be christians [[christian]], on the ground that you hold opinions [[opinion]] which, in [[fact]], you yourselves demolish? is it not because [[christ]] came in lowliness, and ye are proud? the[pg 426] precise [[nature]] of the resurrection bodies [[body]] of the saints may sometimes [[occasion]] discussion among those who are [[best]] [[read]] in the [[christian]] scriptures [[scripture]]; yet there is not among us the smallest [[doubt]] that they shall be everlasting, and of a [[nature]] exemplified in the instance of christ's risen [[body]]. but whatever be their [[nature]], since we maintain that they shall be absolutely incorruptible and [[immortal]], and shall offer no hindrance to the soul's contemplation by which it is fixed in [[god]], and as you say that among the celestials the bodies [[body]] of the eternally blessed are eternal, why do you maintain that, in order to blessedness, every [[body]] must be escaped from? why do you thus seek such a plausible [[reason]] for escaping from the [[christian]] [[faith]], if not because, as i again say, [[christ]] is humble and ye proud? are ye ashamed to be corrected? this is the [[vice]] of the proud. it is, forsooth, a degradation for learned [[men]] to pass from the school of [[plato]] to the discipleship of [[christ]], who by his spirit taught a fisherman to [[think]] and to say, "in the beginning was the word, and the word was with [[god]], and the word was [[god]]. the same was in the beginning with [[god]]. all things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made. in him was [[life]]; and the [[life]] was the [[light]] of [[men]]. and the [[light]] shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not."[427] the old saint simplicianus, afterwards bishop of milan, used to tell me that a [[certain]] platonist was in the habit of saying that this opening passage of the holy gospel, entitled "according to john," should be written in letters of gold, and hung up in all churches [[church]] in the most conspicuous place. but the proud scorn to take [[god]] for their master, because "the word was made flesh and dwelt among us."[428] so that, with these miserable creatures, it is not enough that they are sick, but they boast of their sickness, and are ashamed of the medicine which could heal them. and, doing so, they secure not elevation, but a more disastrous fall.

30. porphyry's emendations and modifications of platonism.

if it is considered unseemly to emend anything which [[plato]] has touched, why did porphyry himself make emendations,[pg 427] and these not a few? for it is very [[certain]] that [[plato]] wrote that the souls [[soul]] of [[men]] return after [[death]] to the bodies [[body]] of beasts.[429] plotinus also, porphyry's teacher, held this [[opinion]];[430] yet porphyry justly rejected it. he was of [[opinion]] that [[human]] souls [[soul]] return indeed into [[human]] bodies [[body]], but not into the bodies [[body]] they had left, but other new bodies [[body]]. he shrank from the other [[opinion]], lest a woman who had returned into a mule might possibly carry her own [[son]] on her back. he did not shrink, however, from a theory which admitted the possibility of a [[mother]] coming back into a girl and marrying her own [[son]]. how much more honourable a creed is that which was taught by the holy and truthful angels, uttered by the prophets [[prophet]] who were moved by god's spirit, preached by him who was foretold as the coming saviour by his forerunning heralds, and by the [[apostles]] whom he sent forth, and who filled the whole [[world]] with the gospel,—how much more honourable, i say, is the [[belief]] that souls [[soul]] return once for all to their own bodies [[body]], than that they return again and again to divers bodies [[body]]? nevertheless porphyry, as i have said, did considerably improve upon this [[opinion]], in so far, at least, as he maintained that [[human]] souls [[soul]] could transmigrate only into [[human]] bodies [[body]], and made no scruple about demolishing the bestial prisons into which [[plato]] had wished to cast them. he says, too, that [[god]] put the [[soul]] into the [[world]] that it might recognise the evils [[evil]] of matter, and return to the [[father]], and be for ever emancipated from the polluting contact of matter. and although here is some inappropriate thinking (for the [[soul]] is rather given to the [[body]] that it may do [[good]]; for it would not learn [[evil]] unless it did it), yet he corrects the [[opinion]] of other platonists, and that on a point of no small importance, inasmuch as he avows that the [[soul]], which is purged from all [[evil]] and received to the father's presence, shall never again suffer the ills of this [[life]]. by this [[opinion]] he quite subverted the favourite platonic dogma, that as [[dead]] [[men]] are made out of living ones, so living [[men]] are made out of [[dead]] ones; and he exploded the [[idea]] which [[virgil]] seems to have adopted from [[plato]], that the purified souls [[soul]] which have been sent into the elysian fields (the poetic[pg 428] name for the joys of the blessed) are summoned to the river lethe, that is, to the oblivion of the [[past]],

"that earthward they may pass once more, remembering not the things before, and with a blind propension yearn to fleshly bodies [[body]] to return."[431]
this found no favour with porphyry, and very justly; for it is indeed foolish to [[believe]] that souls [[soul]] should [[desire]] to return from that [[life]], which cannot be very blessed unless by the assurance of its permanence, and to come back into this [[life]], and to the pollution of corruptible bodies [[body]], as if the result of [[perfect]] purification were only to make defilement desirable. for if [[perfect]] purification effects the oblivion of all evils [[evil]], and the oblivion of evils [[evil]] creates a [[desire]] for a [[body]] in which the [[soul]] may again be entangled with evils [[evil]], then the supreme felicity will be the cause of infelicity, and the [[perfection]] of [[wisdom]] the cause of foolishness, and the purest cleansing the cause of defilement. and, however long the blessedness of the [[soul]] [[last]], it cannot be founded on [[truth]], if, in order to be blessed, it must be deceived. for it cannot be blessed unless it be [[free]] from [[fear]]. but, to be [[free]] from [[fear]], it must be under the false impression that it shall be always blessed,—the false impression, for it is destined to be also at some [[time]] miserable. how, then, shall the [[soul]] rejoice in [[truth]], whose joy is founded on falsehood? porphyry saw this, and therefore said that the purified [[soul]] returns to the [[father]], that it may never more be entangled in the polluting contact with [[evil]]. the [[opinion]], therefore, of some platonists, that there is a necessary [[revolution]] carrying souls [[soul]] away and bringing them round again to the same things, is false. but, were it true, what were the advantage of knowing it? would the platonists presume to allege their superiority to us, because we were in this [[life]] ignorant of what they themselves were doomed to be ignorant of when perfected in purity and [[wisdom]] in another and [[better]] [[life]], and which they must be ignorant of if they are to be blessed? if it were most absurd and foolish to say so, then certainly we must prefer porphyry's [[opinion]] to the [[idea]] of a circulation of souls [[soul]] through constantly alternating[pg 429] [[happiness]] and misery. and if this is just, here is a platonist emending [[plato]], here is a [[man]] who saw what [[plato]] did not see, and who did not shrink from correcting so illustrious a master, but preferred [[truth]] to [[plato]].

31. against the arguments on which the platonists ground their assertion that the [[human]] [[soul]] is co-eternal with [[god]].

why, then, do we not rather [[believe]] the divinity in those matters, which [[human]] talent cannot fathom? why do we not credit the assertion of divinity, that the [[soul]] is not co-eternal with [[god]], but is created, and once was not? for the platonists seemed to themselves to allege an adequate [[reason]] for their rejection of this doctrine, when they affirmed that nothing could be everlasting which had not always existed. [[plato]], however, in writing concerning the [[world]] and the gods in it, whom the supreme made, most expressly states that they had a beginning and yet would have no end, but, by the [[sovereign]] will of the creator, would endure eternally. but, by way of interpreting this, the platonists have discovered that he meant a beginning, not of [[time]], but of cause. "for as if a foot," they say, "had been always from eternity in dust, there would always have been a print underneath it; and yet no one would [[doubt]] that this print was made by the pressure of the foot, nor that, though the one was made by the other, neither was prior to the other; so," they say, "the [[world]] and the gods created in it have always been, their creator always existing, and yet they were made." if, then, the [[soul]] has always existed, are we to say that its wretchedness has always existed? for if there is something in it which was not from eternity, but began in [[time]], why is it impossible that the [[soul]] itself, though not previously existing, should begin to be in [[time]]? its blessedness, too, which, as he owns, is to be more stable, and indeed endless, after the soul's [[experience]] of evils [[evil]],—this undoubtedly has a beginning in [[time]], and yet is to be always, though previously it had no existence. this whole argumentation, therefore, to establish that nothing can be endless except that which has had no beginning, falls to the ground. for here we find the blessedness of the [[soul]], which has a beginning, and yet has no end. and, therefore, let the incapacity of [[man]] give place to the[pg 430] [[authority]] of [[god]]; and let us take our [[belief]] regarding the true [[religion]] from the ever-blessed spirits, who do not seek for themselves that [[honour]] which they [[know]] to be due to their [[god]] and ours, and who do not command us to [[sacrifice]] save only to him, whose [[sacrifice]], as i have often said already, and must often say again, we and they ought together to be, offered through that [[priest]] who offered himself to [[death]] a [[sacrifice]] for us, in that [[human]] [[nature]] which he assumed, and according to which he [[desired]] to be our [[priest]].

32. of the universal way of the soul's deliverance, which porphyry did not find because he did not rightly seek it, and which the grace of [[christ]] has alone thrown open.

this is the [[religion]] which possesses the universal way for delivering the [[soul]]; for, except by this way, none can be delivered. this is a [[kind]] of [[royal]] way, which alone leads to a [[kingdom]] which does not totter like all temporal dignities, but stands firm on eternal foundations. and when porphyry says, towards the end of the first [[book]] de regressu animæ, that no [[system]] of doctrine which furnishes the universal way for delivering the [[soul]] has as yet been received, either from the truest [[philosophy]], or from the ideas [[idea]] and practices of the indians [[indian]], or from the reasoning[432] of the chaldæans, or from any source whatever, and that no historical reading had made him acquainted with that way, he manifestly acknowledges that there is such a way, but that as yet he was not acquainted with it. nothing of all that he had so laboriously learned concerning the deliverance of the [[soul]], nothing of all that he seemed to others, if not to himself, to [[know]] and [[believe]], satisfied him. for he perceived that there was still wanting a commanding [[authority]] which it might be [[right]] to [[follow]] in a matter of such importance. and when he says that he had not learned from any truest [[philosophy]] a [[system]] which possessed the universal way of the soul's deliverance, he shows plainly enough, as it seems to me, either that the [[philosophy]] of which he was a disciple was not the truest, or that it did not comprehend such a way. and how can that be the truest [[philosophy]] which does not possess this way? for what else is the universal way of the soul's deliverance than that by[pg 431] which all souls [[soul]] universally are delivered, and without which, therefore, no [[soul]] is delivered? and when he says, in addition, "or from the ideas [[idea]] and practices of the indians [[indian]], or from the reasoning of the chaldæans, or from any source whatever," he declares in the most unequivocal [[language]] that this universal way of the soul's deliverance was not embraced in what he had learned either from the indians [[indian]] or the chaldæans; and yet he could not forbear stating that it was from the chaldæans he had derived these [[divine]] oracles of which he makes such frequent mention. what, therefore, does he mean by this universal way of the soul's deliverance, which had not yet been made known by any truest [[philosophy]], or by the doctrinal systems [[system]] of those nations which were considered to have [[great]] insight in things [[divine]], because they indulged more freely in a [[curious]] and fanciful [[science]] and [[worship]] of angels? what is this universal way of which he acknowledges his ignorance, if not a way which does not belong to one nation as its special [[property]], but is [[common]] to all, and divinely bestowed? porphyry, a [[man]] of no mediocre abilities, does not [[question]] that such a way exists; for he believes [[belief]] that [[divine]] providence could not have left [[men]] destitute of this universal way of delivering the [[soul]]. for he does not say that this way does not [[exist]], but that this [[great]] boon and assistance has not yet been discovered, and has not come to his [[knowledge]]. and no wonder; for porphyry lived in an [[age]] when this universal way of the soul's deliverance,—in other words, the [[christian]] [[religion]],—was exposed to the persecutions of idolaters and demon-worshippers, and earthly rulers,[433] that the number of martyrs or witnesses for the [[truth]] might be completed and consecrated, and that by them proof might be given that we must endure all bodily sufferings in the cause of the holy [[faith]], and for the commendation of the [[truth]]. porphyry, being a witness of these persecutions, concluded that this way was destined to a speedy extinction, and that it, therefore, was not the universal way of the soul's deliverance, and did not see that the very thing that thus moved him, and deterred him from becoming a [[christian]], contributed to the confirmation and more effectual commendation of our [[religion]].

[pg 432]

this, then, is the universal way of the soul's deliverance, the way that is granted by the [[divine]] compassion to the nations universally. and no nation to which the [[knowledge]] of it has already come, or may hereafter come, ought to demand, why so soon? or, why so late?—for the design of him who sends it is impenetrable by [[human]] capacity. this was [[felt]] by porphyry when he confined himself to saying that this gift of [[god]] was not yet received, and had not yet come to his [[knowledge]]. for, though this was so, he did not on that account pronounce that the way itself had no existence. this, i say, is the universal way for the deliverance of believers, concerning which the faithful [[abraham]] received the [[divine]] assurance, "in thy seed shall all nations be blessed."[434] he, indeed, was by birth a chaldæan; but, that he might receive these [[great]] promises, and that there might be propagated from him a seed "disposed by angels in the hand of a mediator,"[435] in whom this universal way, thrown open to all nations for the deliverance of the [[soul]], might be found, he was ordered to leave his [[country]], and kindred, and father's house. then was he himself, first of all, delivered from the chaldæan superstitions, and by his [[obedience]] worshipped the one true [[god]], whose promises he faithfully trusted. this is the universal way, of which it is said in holy prophecy, "god be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us; that thy way may be known upon [[earth]], thy saving health among all nations."[436] and hence, when our saviour, so long after, had taken flesh of the seed of [[abraham]], he says of himself, "i am the way, the [[truth]], and the [[life]]."[437] this is the universal way, of which so long before it had been predicted, "and it shall come to pass in the [[last]] days, that the mountain of the lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. and many [[people]] shall go and say, come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the [[lord]], to the house of the [[god]] of jacob; and he will [[teach]] us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of sion shall go forth the [[law]], and the[pg 433] word of the [[lord]] from [[jerusalem]]."[438] this way, therefore, is not the [[property]] of one, but of all nations. the [[law]] and the word of the [[lord]] did not remain in zion and [[jerusalem]], but issued thence to be universally diffused. and therefore the mediator himself, after his resurrection, says to his alarmed disciples, "these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the [[law]] of [[moses]], and in the prophets [[prophet]], and in the psalms, concerning me. then opened he their understandings that they might [[understand]] the scriptures [[scripture]], and said unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behoved [[christ]] to suffer, and to rise from the [[dead]] the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins [[sin]] should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at [[jerusalem]]."[439] this is the universal way of the soul's deliverance, which the holy angels and the holy prophets [[prophet]] formerly disclosed where they could among the few [[men]] who found the grace of [[god]], and especially in the [[hebrew]] nation, whose commonwealth was, as it were, consecrated to prefigure and fore-announce the [[city]] of [[god]] which was to be gathered from all nations, by their tabernacle, and temple, and priesthood, and sacrifices [[sacrifice]]. in some explicit statements, and in many obscure foreshadowings, this way was declared; but latterly came the mediator himself in the flesh, and his blessed [[apostles]], revealing how the grace of the new testament more openly explained what had been obscurely hinted to preceding generations [[generation]], in conformity with the relation of the ages [[age]] of the [[human]] [[race]], and as it pleased [[god]] in his [[wisdom]] to appoint, who also bore them witness with signs and [[miracles]], some of which i have cited above. for not only were there visions of angels, and words heard from those heavenly ministrants, but also [[men]] of [[god]], armed with the word of simple piety, cast out unclean spirits from the bodies [[body]] and senses of [[men]], and healed deformities and sicknesses; the wild beasts of [[earth]] and sea, the birds of air, inanimate things, the elements, the stars, obeyed their [[divine]] commands; the powers [[power]] of hell gave way before them, the [[dead]] were restored to [[life]]. i say nothing of the [[miracles]] peculiar and proper to the saviour's own [[person]], especially the nativity[pg 434] and the resurrection; in the one of which he wrought only the mystery of a virgin maternity, while in the other he furnished an instance of the resurrection which all shall at [[last]] [[experience]]. this way purifies the whole [[man]], and prepares the mortal in all his parts for immortality. for, to prevent us from seeking for one purgation for the part which porphyry calls intellectual, and another for the part he calls [[spiritual]], and another for the [[body]] itself, our most mighty and truthful purifier and saviour assumed the whole [[human]] [[nature]]. except by this way, which has been [[present]] among [[men]] both during the period of the promises and of the proclamation of their fulfilment, no [[man]] has been delivered, no [[man]] is delivered, no [[man]] shall be delivered.

as to porphyry's statement that the universal way of the soul's deliverance had not yet come to his [[knowledge]] by any acquaintance he had with [[history]], i would ask, what more remarkable [[history]] can be found than that which has taken possession of the whole [[world]] by its authoritative voice? or what more trustworthy than that which narrates [[past]] events, and predicts the future with [[equal]] clearness, and in the unfulfilled predictions of which we are constrained to [[believe]] by those that are already fulfilled? for neither porphyry nor any platonists can despise divination and prediction, even of things that pertain to this [[life]] and earthly matters, though they justly despise ordinary soothsaying and the divination that is connected with magical [[arts]]. they deny that these are the predictions of [[great]] [[men]], or are to be considered important, and they are [[right]]; for they are founded, either on the foresight of subsidiary causes, as to a professional eye much of the course of a disease is foreseen by [[certain]] premonitory symptoms, or the unclean demons predict what they have resolved to do, that they may thus [[work]] upon the thoughts [[thought]] and desires [[desire]] of the wicked with an appearance of [[authority]], and incline [[human]] frailty to imitate their impure actions. it is not such things that the saints who walk in the universal way [[care]] to predict as important, although, for the [[purpose]] of commending the [[faith]], they knew and often predicted even such things as could not be detected by [[human]] observation, nor be readily verified by [[experience]]. but there[pg 435] were other truly important and [[divine]] events which they predicted, in so far as it was given them to [[know]] the will of [[god]]. for the incarnation of [[christ]], and all those important marvels that were accomplished in him, and done in his name; the repentance of [[men]] and the conversion of their wills to [[god]]; the remission of sins [[sin]], the grace of [[righteousness]], the [[faith]] of the pious, and the multitudes in all parts of the [[world]] who [[believe]] in the true divinity; the overthrow of idolatry and demon [[worship]], and the testing of the faithful by trials; the purification of those who persevered, and their deliverance from all [[evil]]; the day of [[judgment]], the resurrection of the [[dead]], the eternal damnation of the [[community]] of the ungodly, and the eternal [[kingdom]] of the most glorious [[city]] of [[god]], ever-blessed in the enjoyment of the vision of [[god]],—these things were predicted and promised in the scriptures [[scripture]] of this way; and of these we see so many fulfilled, that we justly and piously trust that the rest will also come to pass. as for those who do not [[believe]], and consequently do not [[understand]], that this is the way which leads straight to the vision of [[god]] and to eternal fellowship with him, according to the true predictions and statements of the holy scriptures [[scripture]], they may storm at our position, but they cannot storm it.

and therefore, in these ten books [[book]], though not meeting, i dare say, the expectation of some, yet i have, as the true [[god]] and [[lord]] has vouchsafed to aid me, satisfied the [[desire]] of [[certain]] persons [[person]], by refuting the objections of the ungodly, who prefer their own gods to the founder of the holy [[city]], about which we undertook to speak. of these ten books [[book]], the first five were directed against those who [[think]] we should [[worship]] the gods for the sake of the blessings of this [[life]], and the second five against those who [[think]] we should [[worship]] them for the sake of the [[life]] which is to be after [[death]]. and now, in fulfilment of the promise i made in the first [[book]], i shall go on to say, as [[god]] shall aid me, what i [[think]] needs to be said regarding the origin, [[history]], and deserved ends of the two cities [[city]], which, as already remarked, are in this [[world]] commingled and implicated with one another.

[pg 436]

book eleventh.

argument.

here begins the second part[440] of this [[work]], which treats of the origin, [[history]], and destinies of the two cities [[city]], the earthly and the heavenly. in the first place, augustine shows in this [[book]] how the two cities [[city]] were formed originally, by the separation of the [[good]] and [[bad]] angels; and takes [[occasion]] to treat of the creation of the [[world]], as it is described in holy [[scripture]] in the beginning of the [[book]] of genesis.

1. of this part of the [[work]], wherein we begin to explain the origin and end of the two cities [[city]].

the [[city]] of [[god]] we speak of is the same to which testimony is borne by that [[scripture]], which excels all the writings of all nations by its [[divine]] [[authority]], and has brought under its influence all kinds [[kind]] of minds [[mind]], and this not by a casual intellectual movement, but obviously by an express providential arrangement. for there it is written, "glorious things are spoken of thee, o [[city]] of [[god]]."[441] and in another psalm we [[read]], "great is the [[lord]], and greatly to be praised in the [[city]] of our [[god]], in the mountain of his holiness, increasing the joy of the whole [[earth]]."[442] and, a little after, in the same psalm, "as we have heard, so have we seen in the [[city]] of the [[lord]] of hosts, in the [[city]] of our [[god]]. [[god]] has established it for ever." and in another, "there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the [[city]] of our [[god]], the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high. [[god]] is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved."[443] from these and similar testimonies, all of which it were tedious to cite, we have learned that there is a [[city]] of [[god]], and its founder has inspired us with a [[love]] which makes us covet its citizenship. to this founder of the holy [[city]] the [[citizens]] of the earthly [[city]] prefer their own gods, not knowing that he is the god[pg 437] of gods, not of false, i.e. of impious and proud gods, who, being deprived of his unchangeable and freely communicated [[light]], and so reduced to a [[kind]] of poverty-stricken [[power]], eagerly grasp at their own private privileges [[privilege]], and seek [[divine]] honours [[honour]] from their deluded subjects [[subject]]; but of the pious and holy gods, who are [[better]] pleased to submit themselves to one, than to [[subject]] many to themselves, and who would rather [[worship]] [[god]] than be worshipped as [[god]]. but to the enemies [[enemy]] of this [[city]] we have replied in the ten preceding books [[book]], according to our ability and the [[help]] afforded by our [[lord]] and [[king]]. now, recognising what is expected of me, and not unmindful of my promise, and relying, too, on the same succour, i will endeavour to treat of the origin, and [[progress]], and deserved destinies of the two cities [[city]] (the earthly and the heavenly, to wit), which, as we said, are in this [[present]] [[world]] commingled, and as it were entangled together. and, first, i will explain how the foundations of these two cities [[city]] were originally laid, in the difference that arose among the angels.

2. of the [[knowledge]] of [[god]], to which no [[man]] can attain save through the mediator between [[god]] and [[men]], the [[man]] [[christ]] [[jesus]].

it is a [[great]] and very rare thing for a [[man]], after he has contemplated the whole creation, corporeal and incorporeal, and has discerned its mutability, to pass beyond it, and, by the continued soaring of his [[mind]], to attain to the unchangeable substance of [[god]], and, in that height of contemplation, to learn from [[god]] himself that none but he has made all that is not of the [[divine]] essence. for [[god]] speaks with a [[man]] not by means of some audible creature dinning in his ears, so that atmospheric vibrations connect him that makes with him that hears the sound, nor even by means of a [[spiritual]] being with the semblance of a [[body]], such as we see in dreams [[dream]] or similar states; for even in this case he speaks as if to the ears of the [[body]], because it is by means of the semblance of a [[body]] he speaks, and with the appearance of a real interval of space,—for visions are exact representations of bodily objects. not by these, then, does [[god]] speak, but by the [[truth]] itself, if any one is prepared to hear with the [[mind]] rather than with the [[body]]. for he speaks to that part of [[man]] which is [[better]] than all else that is in him, and than which [[god]] himself[pg 438] alone is [[better]]. for since [[man]] is most properly understood (or, if that cannot be, then, at least, believed) to be made in god's image, no [[doubt]] it is that part of him by which he rises above those lower parts he has in [[common]] with the beasts, which brings him nearer to the supreme. but since the [[mind]] itself, though naturally capable of [[reason]] and [[intelligence]], is disabled by besotting and inveterate vices [[vice]] not merely from delighting and abiding in, but even from tolerating his unchangeable [[light]], until it has been gradually healed, and renewed, and made capable of such felicity, it had, in the first place, to be impregnated with [[faith]], and so purified. and that in this [[faith]] it might advance the more confidently towards the [[truth]], the [[truth]] itself, [[god]], god's [[son]], assuming [[humanity]] without destroying his divinity,[444] established and founded this [[faith]], that there might be a way for [[man]] to man's [[man]] [[god]] through a god-man. for this is the mediator between [[god]] and [[men]], the [[man]] [[christ]] [[jesus]]. for it is as [[man]] that he is the mediator and the way. since, if the way lieth between him who goes, and the place whither he goes, there is [[hope]] of his reaching it; but if there be no way, or if he [[know]] not where it is, what boots it to [[know]] whither he should go? now the only way that is infallibly secured against all mistakes, is when the very same [[person]] is at once [[god]] and [[man]], [[god]] our end, [[man]] our way.[445]

3. of the [[authority]] of the canonical scriptures [[scripture]] composed by the [[divine]] spirit.

this mediator, having spoken what he judged sufficient, first by the prophets [[prophet]], then by his own lips, and afterwards by the [[apostles]], has besides produced the [[scripture]] which is called canonical, which has paramount [[authority]], and to which we yield assent in all matters of which we ought not to be ignorant, and yet cannot [[know]] of ourselves. for if we attain the [[knowledge]] of [[present]] objects by the testimony of our own senses,[446] whether internal or external, then, regarding objects remote from our own senses, we need others to bring their[pg 439] testimony, since we cannot [[know]] them by our own, and we credit the persons [[person]] to whom the objects have been or are sensibly [[present]]. accordingly, as in the case of visible objects which we have not seen, we trust those who have, (and likewise with all sensible objects,) so in the case of things which are perceived[447] by the [[mind]] and spirit, i.e. which are remote from our own interior sense, it behoves us to trust those who have seen them set in that incorporeal [[light]], or abidingly contemplate them.

4. that the [[world]] is neither without beginning, nor yet created by a new decree of [[god]], by which he afterwards willed what he had not before willed.

of all visible things, the [[world]] is the [[greatest]]; of all invisible, the [[greatest]] is [[god]]. but, that the [[world]] is, we see; that [[god]] is, we [[believe]]. that [[god]] made the [[world]], we can [[believe]] from no one more safely than from [[god]] himself. but where have we heard him? nowhere more distinctly than in the holy scriptures [[scripture]], where his [[prophet]] said, "in the beginning [[god]] created the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]."[448] was the [[prophet]] [[present]] when [[god]] made the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]? no; but the [[wisdom]] of [[god]], by whom all things were made, was there,[449] and [[wisdom]] insinuates itself into holy souls [[soul]], and makes them the [[friends]] of [[god]] and his prophets [[prophet]], and noiselessly informs them of his works [[work]]. they are taught also by the angels of [[god]], who always behold the face of the [[father]],[450] and announce his will to whom it befits. of these prophets [[prophet]] was he who said and wrote, "in the beginning [[god]] created the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]." and so fit a witness was he of [[god]], that the same spirit of [[god]], who revealed these things to him, enabled him also so long before to predict that our [[faith]] also would be forthcoming.

but why did [[god]] choose then to create the heavens [[heaven]] and [[earth]] which up to that [[time]] he had not made?[451] if they who put this [[question]] [[wish]] to make out that the [[world]] is eternal and without beginning, and that consequently it has[pg 440] not been made by [[god]], they are strangely deceived, and rave in the incurable madness of impiety. for, though the voices of the prophets [[prophet]] were silent, the [[world]] itself, by its well-ordered changes [[change]] and movements, and by the [[fair]] appearance of all visible things, bears a testimony of its own, both that it has been created, and also that it could not have been created save by [[god]], whose greatness and [[beauty]] are unutterable and invisible. as for those[452] who own, indeed, that it was made by [[god]], and yet ascribe to it not a temporal but only a creational beginning, so that in some scarcely intelligible way the [[world]] should always have existed a created [[world]], they make an assertion which seems to them to defend [[god]] from the charge of arbitrary hastiness, or of suddenly conceiving the [[idea]] of creating the [[world]] as a quite new [[idea]], or of casually changing his will, though he be unchangeable. but i do not see how this supposition of theirs can stand in other respects [[respect]], and chiefly in [[respect]] of the [[soul]]; for if they contend that it is co-eternal with [[god]], they will be quite at a loss to explain whence there has accrued to it new misery, which through a previous eternity had not existed. for if they said that its [[happiness]] and misery ceaselessly alternate, they must say, further, that this alternation will continue for ever; whence will result this absurdity, that, though the [[soul]] is called blessed, it is not so in this, that it foresees its own misery and disgrace. and yet, if it does not foresee it, and supposes that it will be neither disgraced nor wretched, but always blessed, then it is blessed because it is deceived; and a more foolish statement one cannot make. but if their [[idea]] is that the soul's misery has alternated with its bliss during the ages [[age]] of the [[past]] eternity, but that now, when once the [[soul]] has been set [[free]], it will return henceforth no more to misery, they are nevertheless of [[opinion]] that it has never been truly blessed before, but begins at [[last]] to enjoy a new and uncertain [[happiness]]; that is to say, they must acknowledge that some new thing, and that an important and signal thing, happens to the [[soul]] which never in a whole [[past]] eternity happened it before. and if they deny that god's eternal [[purpose]] included this new [[experience]] of the [[soul]], they deny that he is the author[pg 441] of its blessedness, which is unspeakable impiety. if, on the other hand, they say that the future blessedness of the [[soul]] is the result of a new decree of [[god]], how will they show that [[god]] is not chargeable with that mutability which displeases them? further, if they acknowledge that it was created in [[time]], but will never perish in [[time]],—that it has, like number,[453] a beginning but no end,—and that, therefore, having once made [[trial]] of misery, and been delivered from it, it will never again return thereto, they will certainly admit that this takes place without any violation of the immutable counsel of [[god]]. let them, then, in like manner [[believe]] regarding the [[world]] that it too could be made in [[time]], and yet that [[god]], in making it, did not alter his eternal design.

5. that we ought not to seek to comprehend the infinite ages [[age]] of [[time]] before the [[world]], nor the infinite realms of space.

next, we must see what reply can be made to those who agree that [[god]] is the creator of the [[world]], but have difficulties about the [[time]] of its creation, and what reply, also, they can make to difficulties we might raise about the place of its creation. for, as they demand why the [[world]] was created then and no sooner, we may ask why it was created just here where it is, and not elsewhere. for if they imagine infinite spaces of [[time]] before the [[world]], during which [[god]] could not have been idle, in like manner they may conceive outside the [[world]] infinite realms of space, in which, if any one says that the omnipotent cannot hold his hand from working, will it not [[follow]] that they must adopt epicurus' [[dream]] of innumerable worlds [[world]]? with this difference only, that he asserts that they are formed and destroyed by the fortuitous movements of atoms, while they will hold that they are made by god's hand, if they maintain that, throughout the boundless immensity of space, stretching interminably in every direction round the [[world]], [[god]] cannot rest, and that the worlds [[world]] which they suppose him to make cannot be destroyed. for here the [[question]] is with those who, with ourselves, [[believe]] that [[god]] is [[spiritual]], and the creator of all existences but himself. as for others, it is a condescension to dispute with them on a [[religious]] [[question]], for they have acquired a [[reputation]] only among men[pg 442] who [[pay]] [[divine]] honours [[honour]] to a number of gods, and have become conspicuous among the other [[philosophers]] for no other [[reason]] than that, though they are still far from the [[truth]], they are near it in comparison with the rest. while these, then, neither confine in any place, nor limit, nor distribute the [[divine]] substance, but, as is worthy of [[god]], own it to be wholly though spiritually [[present]] everywhere, will they perchance say that this substance is absent from such immense spaces outside the [[world]], and is occupied in one only, (and that a very little one compared with the infinity beyond,) the one, namely, in which is the [[world]]? i [[think]] they will not proceed to this absurdity. since they maintain that there is but one [[world]], of vast material bulk, indeed, yet finite, and in its own determinate position, and that this was made by the working of [[god]], let them give the same account of god's resting in the infinite times [[time]] before the [[world]] as they give of his resting in the infinite spaces outside of it. and as it does not [[follow]] that [[god]] set the [[world]] in the very spot it occupies and no other by accident rather than by [[divine]] [[reason]], although no [[human]] [[reason]] can comprehend why it was so set, and though there was no [[merit]] in the spot chosen to give it the precedence of infinite others, so neither does it [[follow]] that we should suppose that [[god]] was guided by [[chance]] when he created the [[world]] in that and no earlier [[time]], although previous times [[time]] had been running by during an infinite [[past]], and though there was no difference by which one [[time]] could be chosen in preference to another. but if they say that the thoughts [[thought]] of [[men]] are idle when they conceive infinite places, since there is no place beside the [[world]], we reply that, by the same showing, it is [[vain]] to conceive of the [[past]] times [[time]] of god's rest, since there is no [[time]] before the [[world]].

6. that the [[world]] and [[time]] had both one beginning, and the one did not anticipate the other.

for if eternity and [[time]] are rightly distinguished by this, that [[time]] does not [[exist]] without some movement and transition, while in eternity there is no [[change]], who does not see that there could have been no [[time]] had not some creature been made, which by some motion could give birth to [[change]],—the various parts of which motion and [[change]], as they cannot be[pg 443] simultaneous, succeed one another,—and thus, in these shorter or longer intervals of duration, [[time]] would begin? since then, [[god]], in whose eternity is no [[change]] at all, is the creator and ordainer of [[time]], i do not see how he can be said to have created the [[world]] after spaces of [[time]] had elapsed, unless it be said that prior to the [[world]] there was some creature by whose movement [[time]] could pass. and if the [[sacred]] and infallible scriptures [[scripture]] say that in the beginning [[god]] created the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]], in order that it may be understood that he had made nothing previously,—for if he had made anything before the rest, this thing would rather be said to have been made "in the beginning,"—then assuredly the [[world]] was made, not in [[time]], but simultaneously with [[time]]. for that which is made in [[time]] is made both after and before some [[time]],—after that which is [[past]], before that which is future. but none could then be [[past]], for there was no creature by whose movements its duration could be measured. but simultaneously with [[time]] the [[world]] was made, if in the world's creation [[change]] and motion were created, as seems evident from the order of the first six or seven days. for in these days the morning and evening are counted, until, on the sixth day, all things which [[god]] then made were finished, and on the seventh the rest of [[god]] was mysteriously and sublimely signalized. what [[kind]] of days these were it is extremely difficult, or perhaps impossible for us to conceive, and how much more to say!

7. of the [[nature]] of the first days, which are said to have had morning and evening, before there was a sun.

we see, indeed, that our ordinary days have no evening but by the setting, and no morning but by the rising, of the sun; but the first three days of all were passed without sun, since it is reported to have been made on the fourth day. and first of all, indeed, [[light]] was made by the word of [[god]], and [[god]], we [[read]], separated it from the darkness, and called the [[light]] day, and the darkness night; but what [[kind]] of [[light]] that was, and by what periodic movement it made evening and morning, is beyond the reach of our senses; neither can we [[understand]] how it was, and yet must unhesitatingly [[believe]] it. for either it was some material [[light]], whether proceeding from the upper[pg 444] parts of the [[world]], far removed from our sight, or from the spot where the sun was afterwards kindled; or under the name of [[light]] the holy [[city]] was signified, composed of holy angels and blessed spirits, the [[city]] of which the apostle says, "jerusalem which is above is our eternal [[mother]] in [[heaven]];"[454] and in another place, "for ye are all the [[children]] of the [[light]], and the [[children]] of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness."[455] yet in some respects [[respect]] we may appropriately speak of a morning and evening of this day also. for the [[knowledge]] of the creature is, in comparison of the [[knowledge]] of the creator, but a twilight; and so it dawns and breaks into morning when the creature is drawn to the [[praise]] and [[love]] of the creator; and night never falls when the creator is not forsaken through [[love]] of the creature. in fine, [[scripture]], when it would recount those days in order, never mentions the word night. it never says, "night was," but "the evening and the morning were the first day." so of the second and the rest. and, indeed, the [[knowledge]] of created things contemplated by themselves is, so to speak, more colourless than when they are seen in the [[wisdom]] of [[god]], as in the art [[arts]] by which they were made. therefore evening is a more suitable figure than night; and yet, as i said, morning returns when the creature returns to the [[praise]] and [[love]] of the creator. when it does so in the [[knowledge]] of itself, that is the first day; when in the [[knowledge]] of the firmament, which is the name given to the [[sky]] between the waters above and those beneath, that is the second day; when in the [[knowledge]] of the [[earth]], and the sea, and all things that grow out of the [[earth]], that is the third day; when in the [[knowledge]] of the greater and less luminaries, and all the stars, that is the fourth day; when in the [[knowledge]] of all animals that swim in the waters and that fly in the air, that is the fifth day; when in the [[knowledge]] of all animals that [[live]] on the [[earth]], and of [[man]] himself, that is the sixth day.[456]

8. what we are to [[understand]] of god's resting on the seventh day, after the six days' [[work]].

when it is said that [[god]] rested on the seventh day from all his works [[work]], and hallowed it, we are not to conceive of this[pg 445] in a childish [[fashion]], as if [[work]] were a toil to [[god]], who "spake and it was done,"—spake by the [[spiritual]] and eternal, not audible and transitory word. but god's rest signifies the rest of those who rest in [[god]], as the joy of a house means the joy of those in the house who rejoice, though not the house, but something else, causes the joy. how much more intelligible is such phraseology, then, if the house itself, by its own [[beauty]], makes the inhabitants joyful! for in this case we not only call it joyful by that figure of [[speech]] in which the thing containing is used for the thing contained (as when we say, "the theatres applaud," "the meadows low," meaning that the [[men]] in the one applaud, and the oxen in the other low), but also by that figure in which the cause is spoken of as if it were the effect, as when a letter is said to be joyful, because it makes its readers so. most appropriately, therefore, the [[sacred]] narrative states that [[god]] rested, meaning thereby that those rest who are in him, and whom he makes to rest. and this the prophetic narrative promises also to the [[men]] to whom it speaks, and for whom it was written, that they themselves, after those [[good]] works [[work]] which [[god]] does in and by them, if they have managed by [[faith]] to get near to [[god]] in this [[life]], shall enjoy in him eternal rest. this was prefigured to the ancient [[people]] of [[god]] by the rest enjoined in their [[sabbath]] [[law]], of which, in its own place, i shall speak more at large.

9. what the scriptures [[scripture]] [[teach]] us to [[believe]] concerning the creation of the angels.

at [[present]], since i have undertaken to treat of the origin of the holy [[city]], and first of the holy angels, who constitute a large part of this [[city]], and indeed the more blessed part, since they have never been expatriated, i will give myself to the task of explaining, by god's [[help]], and as far as seems suitable, the scriptures [[scripture]] which relate to this point. where [[scripture]] speaks of the world's creation, it is not plainly said whether or when the angels were created; but if mention of them is made, it is implicitly under the name of "heaven," when it is said, "in the beginning [[god]] created the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]," or perhaps rather under the name of "light," of which presently. but that they were wholly omitted, i[pg 446] am unable to [[believe]], because it is written that [[god]] on the seventh day rested from all his works [[work]] which he made; and this very [[book]] itself begins, "in the beginning [[god]] created the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]," so that before [[heaven]] and [[earth]] [[god]] seems to have made nothing. since, therefore, he began with the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]],—and the [[earth]] itself, as [[scripture]] adds, was at first invisible and formless, [[light]] not being as yet made, and darkness covering the face of the deep (that is to say, covering an undefined [[chaos]] of [[earth]] and sea, for where [[light]] is not, darkness must needs be),—and then when all things, which are recorded to have been completed in six days, were created and arranged, how should the angels be omitted, as if they were not among the works [[work]] of [[god]], from which on the seventh day he rested? yet, though the [[fact]] that the angels are the [[work]] of [[god]] is not omitted here, it is indeed not explicitly mentioned; but elsewhere holy [[scripture]] asserts it in the clearest manner. for in the hymn of the three [[children]] in the furnace it was said, "o all ye works [[work]] of the [[lord]], bless ye the [[lord]];"[457] and among these works [[work]] mentioned afterwards in detail, the angels are named. and in the psalm it is said, "praise ye the [[lord]] from the heavens [[heaven]], [[praise]] him in the heights. [[praise]] ye him, all his angels; [[praise]] ye him, all his hosts. [[praise]] ye him, sun and moon; [[praise]] him, all ye stars of [[light]]. [[praise]] him, ye [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]]; and ye waters that be above the heavens [[heaven]]. let them [[praise]] the name of the [[lord]]; for he commanded, and they were created."[458] here the angels are most expressly and by [[divine]] [[authority]] said to have been made by [[god]], for of them among the other heavenly things it is said, "he commanded, and they were created." who, then, will be bold enough to suggest that the angels were made after the six days' creation? if any one is so foolish, his folly is disposed of by a [[scripture]] of like [[authority]], where [[god]] says, "when the stars were made, the angels praised me with a loud voice."[459] the angels therefore existed before the stars; and the stars were made the fourth day. shall we then say that they were made the third day? far from it; for we [[know]] what was made that day. the [[earth]] was separated from the water, and each[pg 447] element took its own distinct form, and the [[earth]] produced all that grows on it. on the second day, then? not even on this; for on it the firmament was made between the waters above and beneath, and was called "heaven," in which firmament the stars were made on the fourth day. there is no [[question]], then, that if the angels are included in the works [[work]] of [[god]] during these six days, they are that [[light]] which was called "day," and whose unity [[scripture]] signalizes by calling that day not the "first day," but "one day."[460] for the second day, the third, and the rest are not other days; but the same "one" day is repeated to complete the number six or seven, so that there should be [[knowledge]] both of god's works [[work]] and of his rest. for when [[god]] said, "let there be [[light]], and there was [[light]]," if we are justified in understanding in this [[light]] the creation of the angels, then certainly they were created partakers of the eternal [[light]] which is the unchangeable [[wisdom]] of [[god]], by which all things were made, and whom we call the only-begotten [[son]] of [[god]]; so that they, being illumined by the [[light]] that created them, might themselves become [[light]] and be called "day," in participation of that unchangeable [[light]] and day which is the word of [[god]], by whom both themselves and all else were made. "the true [[light]], which lighteth every [[man]] that cometh into the [[world]],"[461]—this [[light]] lighteth also every pure angel, that he may be [[light]] not in himself, but in [[god]]; from whom if an angel turn away, he becomes impure, as are all those who are called unclean spirits, and are no longer [[light]] in the [[lord]], but darkness in themselves, being deprived of the participation of [[light]] eternal. for [[evil]] has no positive [[nature]]; but the loss of [[good]] has received the name "evil."[462]

10. of the simple and unchangeable trinity, [[father]], [[son]], and holy ghost, one [[god]], in whom substance and quality are identical.

there is, accordingly, a [[good]] which is alone simple, and therefore alone unchangeable, and this is [[god]]. by this good[pg 448] have all others been created, but not simple, and therefore not unchangeable. "created," i say,—that is, made, not begotten. for that which is begotten of the simple [[good]] is simple as itself, and the same as itself. these two we call the [[father]] and the [[son]]; and both together with the holy spirit are one [[god]]; and to this spirit the epithet holy is in [[scripture]], as it were, appropriated. and he is another than the [[father]] and the [[son]], for he is neither the [[father]] nor the [[son]]. i say "another," not "another thing," because he is equally with them the simple [[good]], unchangeable and co-eternal. and this trinity is one [[god]]; and none the less simple because a trinity. for we do not say that the [[nature]] of the [[good]] is simple, because the [[father]] alone possesses it, or the [[son]] alone, or the holy ghost alone; nor do we say, with the sabellian heretics, that it is only nominally a trinity, and has no real distinction of persons [[person]]; but we say it is simple, because it is what it has, with the exception of the relation of the persons [[person]] to one another. for, in regard to this relation, it is true that the [[father]] has a [[son]], and yet is not himself the [[son]]; and the [[son]] has a [[father]], and is not himself the [[father]]. but, as regards himself, irrespective of relation to the other, each is what he has; thus, he is in himself living, for he has [[life]], and is himself the [[life]] which he has.

it is for this [[reason]], then, that the [[nature]] of the trinity is called simple, because it has not anything which it can lose, and because it is not one thing and its contents another, as a cup and the liquor, or a [[body]] and its colour, or the air and the [[light]] or heat of it, or a [[mind]] and its [[wisdom]]. for none of these is what it has: the cup is not liquor, nor the [[body]] colour, nor the air [[light]] and heat, nor the [[mind]] [[wisdom]]. and hence they can be deprived of what they have, and can be turned or changed into other qualities and states, so that the cup may be emptied of the liquid of which it is full, the [[body]] be discoloured, the air darken, the [[mind]] grow silly. the incorruptible [[body]] which is promised to the saints in the resurrection cannot, indeed, lose its quality of incorruption, but the bodily substance and the quality of incorruption are not the same thing. for the quality of incorruption resides entire in each several part, not greater in one and less in[pg 449] another; for no part is more incorruptible than another. the [[body]], indeed, is itself greater in whole than in part; and one part of it is larger, another smaller, yet is not the larger more incorruptible than the smaller. the [[body]], then, which is not in each of its parts a whole [[body]], is one thing; incorruptibility, which is throughout complete, is another thing;—for every part of the incorruptible [[body]], however unequal to the rest otherwise, is equally incorrupt. for the hand, e.g., is not more incorrupt than the finger because it is larger than the finger; so, though finger and hand are unequal, their incorruptibility is [[equal]]. thus, although incorruptibility is inseparable from an incorruptible [[body]], yet the substance of the [[body]] is one thing, the quality of incorruption another. and therefore the [[body]] is not what it has. the [[soul]] itself, too, though it be always [[wise]] (as it will be eternally when it is redeemed), will be so by participating in the unchangeable [[wisdom]], which it is not; for though the air be never robbed of the [[light]] that is shed abroad in it, it is not on that account the same thing as the [[light]]. i do not mean that the [[soul]] is air, as has been supposed by some who could not conceive a [[spiritual]] [[nature]];[463] but, with much dissimilarity, the two things have a [[kind]] of likeness, which makes it suitable to say that the immaterial [[soul]] is illumined with the immaterial [[light]] of the simple [[wisdom]] of [[god]], as the material air is irradiated with material [[light]], and that, as the air, when deprived of this [[light]], grows dark, (for material darkness is nothing else than air wanting [[light]],[464]) so the [[soul]], deprived of the [[light]] of [[wisdom]], grows dark.

according to this, then, those things which are essentially and truly [[divine]] are called simple, because in them quality and substance are identical, and because they are [[divine]], or [[wise]], or blessed in themselves, and without extraneous supplement. in holy [[scripture]], it is true, the spirit of [[wisdom]] is[pg 450] called "manifold"[465] because it contains many things in it; but what it contains it also is, and it being one is all these things. for neither are there many wisdoms, but one, in which are untold and infinite treasures of things intellectual, wherein are all invisible and unchangeable reasons [[reason]] of things visible and changeable which were created by it.[466] for [[god]] made nothing unwittingly; not even a [[human]] workman can be said to do so. but if he knew all that he made, he made only those things which he had known. whence flows a very striking but true conclusion, that this [[world]] could not be known to us unless it existed, but could not have existed unless it had been known to [[god]].

11. whether the angels that fell partook of the blessedness which the holy angels have always enjoyed from the [[time]] of their creation.

and since these things are so, those spirits whom we call angels were never at any [[time]] or in any way darkness, but, as soon as they were made, were made [[light]]; yet they were not so created in order that they might [[exist]] and [[live]] in any way whatever, but were enlightened that they might [[live]] wisely and blessedly. some of them, having turned away from this [[light]], have not won this [[wise]] and blessed [[life]], which is certainly eternal, and accompanied with the sure confidence of its eternity; but they have still the [[life]] of [[reason]], though darkened with folly, and this they cannot lose, even if they would. but who can determine to what extent they were partakers of that [[wisdom]] before they fell? and how shall we say that they participated in it equally with those who through it are truly and fully blessed, resting in a true certainty of eternal felicity? for if they had equally participated in this true [[knowledge]], then the [[evil]] angels would have remained eternally blessed equally with the [[good]], because they were equally expectant of it. for, though a [[life]] be never so long, it cannot be truly called eternal if it is destined to have an end; for it is called [[life]] inasmuch as it is lived, but eternal because it has no end. wherefore, although everything eternal is not therefore blessed (for hell-fire is eternal), yet if no [[life]] can be[pg 451] truly and perfectly blessed except it be eternal, the [[life]] of these angels was not blessed, for it was doomed to end, and therefore not eternal, whether they knew it or not. in the one case [[fear]], in the other ignorance, prevented them from being blessed. and even if their ignorance was not so [[great]] as to breed in them a wholly false expectation, but left them wavering in uncertainty whether their [[good]] would be eternal or would some [[time]] terminate, this very [[doubt]] concerning so grand a [[destiny]] was incompatible with the plenitude of blessedness which we [[believe]] the holy angels enjoyed. for we do not so narrow and restrict the application of the term "blessedness" as to apply it to [[god]] only,[467] though doubtless he is so truly blessed that greater blessedness cannot be; and, in comparison of his blessedness, what is that of the angels, though, according to their capacity, they be perfectly blessed?

12. a comparison of the blessedness of the righteous, who have not yet received the [[divine]] [[reward]], with that of our first parents in paradise.

and the angels are not the only members of the [[rational]] and intellectual creation whom we call blessed. for who will take upon him to deny that those first [[men]] in paradise were blessed previously to [[sin]], although they were uncertain how long their blessedness was to [[last]], and whether it would be eternal (and eternal it would have been had they not sinned),—who, i say, will do so, seeing that even now we not unbecomingly call those blessed whom we see leading a righteous and holy [[life]] in [[hope]] of immortality, who have no harrowing remorse of [[conscience]], but obtain readily [[divine]] remission of the sins [[sin]] of their [[present]] infirmity? these, though they are [[certain]] that they shall be rewarded if they persevere, are not [[certain]] that they will persevere. for what [[man]] can [[know]] that he will persevere to the end in the exercise and increase of grace, unless he has been certified by some revelation from him who, in his just and secret [[judgment]], while he deceives none, informs few regarding this matter? accordingly,[pg 452] so far as [[present]] comfort goes, the first [[man]] in paradise was more blessed than any just [[man]] in this insecure [[state]]; but as regards the [[hope]] of future [[good]], every [[man]] who not merely supposes, but certainly knows [[know]] that he shall eternally enjoy the most high [[god]] in the company of angels, and beyond the reach of ill,—this [[man]], no matter what bodily torments afflict him, is more blessed than was he who, even in that [[great]] felicity of paradise, was uncertain of his [[fate]].[468]

13. whether all the angels were so created in one [[common]] [[state]] of felicity, that those who fell were not aware that they would fall, and that those who stood received assurance of their own perseverance after the ruin of the fallen.

from all this, it will readily occur to any one that the blessedness which an [[intelligent]] being desires [[desire]] as its legitimate object results from a combination of these two things, namely, that it uninterruptedly enjoy the unchangeable [[good]], which is [[god]]; and that it be delivered from all dubiety, and [[know]] certainly that it shall eternally abide in the same enjoyment. that it is so with the angels of [[light]] we piously [[believe]]; but that the fallen angels, who by their own default lost that [[light]], did not enjoy this blessedness even before they sinned, [[reason]] bids us conclude. yet if their [[life]] was of any duration before they fell, we must allow them a blessedness of some [[kind]], though not that which is accompanied with foresight. or, if it seems hard to [[believe]] that, when the angels were created, some were created in ignorance either of their perseverance or their fall, while others were most certainly assured of the eternity of their felicity,—if it is hard to [[believe]] that they were not all from the beginning on an [[equal]] footing, until these who are now [[evil]] did of their own will fall away from the [[light]] of goodness, certainly it is much harder to [[believe]] that the holy angels are now uncertain of their eternal blessedness, and do not [[know]] regarding themselves as much as we have been able to gather regarding them from the holy scriptures [[scripture]]. for what catholic [[christian]] does not [[know]] that no new [[devil]] will ever arise among the [[good]] angels, as he knows [[know]] that this [[present]] [[devil]] will never again return into the[pg 453] fellowship of the [[good]]? for the [[truth]] in the gospel promises to the saints and the faithful that they will be [[equal]] to the angels of [[god]]; and it is also promised them that they will "go away into [[life]] eternal."[469] but if we are [[certain]] that we shall never lapse from eternal felicity, while they are not [[certain]], then we shall not be their equals [[equal]], but their superiors. but as the [[truth]] never deceives, and as we shall be their equals [[equal]], they must be [[certain]] of their blessedness. and because the [[evil]] angels could not be [[certain]] of that, since their blessedness was destined to come to an end, it follows either that the angels were unequal, or that, if [[equal]], the [[good]] angels were assured of the eternity of their blessedness after the perdition of the others; unless, possibly, some one may say that the words of the [[lord]] about the [[devil]], "he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the [[truth]],"[470] are to be understood as if he was not only a murderer from the beginning of the [[human]] [[race]], when [[man]], whom he could kill by his deceit, was made, but also that he did not abide in the [[truth]] from the [[time]] of his own creation, and was accordingly never blessed with the holy angels, but refused to submit to his creator, and proudly exulted as if in a private lordship of his own, and was thus deceived and deceiving. for the dominion of the almighty cannot be eluded; and he who will not piously submit himself to things as they are, proudly feigns, and mocks himself with a [[state]] of things that does not [[exist]]; so that what the blessed apostle john says thus becomes intelligible: "the [[devil]] sinneth from the beginning,"[471]—that is, from the [[time]] he was created he refused [[righteousness]] which none but a will piously [[subject]] to [[god]] can enjoy. whoever adopts this [[opinion]] at least disagrees with those heretics the manichees, and with any other pestilential sect that may suppose that the [[devil]] has derived from some adverse [[evil]] [[principle]] a [[nature]] proper to himself. these persons [[person]] are so befooled by error, that, although they acknowledge with ourselves the [[authority]] of the gospels, they do not notice that the [[lord]] did not say, "the [[devil]] was naturally a stranger to the [[truth]]," but "the [[devil]] abode not in the [[truth]]," by which he meant us to [[understand]] that he[pg 454] had fallen from the [[truth]], in which, if he had abode, he would have become a partaker of it, and have remained in blessedness along with the holy angels.[472]

14. an explanation of what is said of the [[devil]], that he did not abide in the [[truth]], because the [[truth]] was not in him.

moreover, as if we had been inquiring why the [[devil]] did not abide in the [[truth]], our [[lord]] subjoins the [[reason]], saying, "because the [[truth]] is not in him." now, it would be in him had he abode in it. but the phraseology is unusual. for, as the words stand, "he abode not in the [[truth]], because the [[truth]] is not in him," it seems as if the truth's not being in him were the cause of his not abiding in it; whereas his not abiding in the [[truth]] is rather the cause of its not being in him. the same form of [[speech]] is found in the psalm: "i have called upon thee, for thou hast heard me, o [[god]],"[473] where we should expect it to be said, thou hast heard me, o [[god]], for i have called upon thee. but when he had said, "i have called," then, as if some one were seeking proof of this, he demonstrates the effectual earnestness of his prayer by the effect of god's hearing it; as if he had said, the proof that i have prayed is that thou hast heard me.

15. how we are to [[understand]] the words, "the [[devil]] sinneth from the beginning."

as for what john says about the [[devil]], "the [[devil]] sinneth from the beginning,"[474] they[475] who suppose it is meant hereby that the [[devil]] was made with a sinful [[nature]], misunderstand it; for if [[sin]] be [[natural]], it is not [[sin]] at all. and how do they [[answer]] the prophetic proofs,—either what isaiah says when he represents the [[devil]] under the [[person]] of the [[king]] of [[babylon]], "how art [[arts]] thou fallen, o lucifer, [[son]] of the morning!"[476] or what ezekiel says, "thou hast been in eden, the garden of [[god]]; every precious stone was thy covering,"[477] where it is meant that he was some [[time]] without [[sin]]; for a little after it is still more explicitly said, "thou wast [[perfect]] in thy ways?" and if these passages cannot well be otherwise interpreted, we must [[understand]] by this one also, "he abode not in the [[truth]]," that he was once in the [[truth]],[pg 455] but did not remain in it. and from this passage, "the [[devil]] sinneth from the beginning," it is not to be supposed that he sinned from the beginning of his created existence, but from the beginning of his [[sin]], when by his [[pride]] he had once commenced to [[sin]]. there is a passage, too, in the [[book]] of [[job]], of which the [[devil]] is the [[subject]]: "this is the beginning of the creation of [[god]], which he made to be a [[sport]] to his angels,"[478] which agrees with the psalm, where it is said, "there is that dragon which thou hast made to be a [[sport]] therein."[479] but these passages are not to lead us to suppose that the [[devil]] was originally created to be the [[sport]] of the angels, but that he was doomed to this [[punishment]] after his [[sin]]. his beginning, then, is the handiwork of [[god]]; for there is no [[nature]], even among the least, and lowest, and [[last]] of the beasts, which was not the [[work]] of him from whom has proceeded all measure, all form, all order, without which nothing can be planned or conceived. how much more, then, is this angelic [[nature]], which surpasses in [[dignity]] all else that he has made, the handiwork of the most high!

16. of the ranks and differences of the creatures, estimated by their utility, or according to the [[natural]] gradations of being.

for, among those beings which [[exist]], and which are not of [[god]] the creator's essence, those which have [[life]] are ranked above those which have none; those that have the [[power]] of [[generation]], or even of desiring, above those which want this faculty. and, among things that have [[life]], the sentient are higher than those which have no sensation, as animals are ranked above trees. and, among the sentient, the [[intelligent]] are above those that have not [[intelligence]],—men, e.g., above cattle. and, among the [[intelligent]], the [[immortal]], such as the angels, above the mortal, such as [[men]]. these are the gradations according to the order of [[nature]]; but according to the utility each [[man]] finds in a thing, there are various standards of value, so that it comes to pass that we prefer some things that have no sensation to some sentient beings. and so [[strong]] is this preference, that, had we the [[power]], we would abolish the latter from [[nature]] altogether, whether in ignorance of the place they hold in [[nature]], or, though we [[know]] it, sacrificing[pg 456] them to our own convenience. who, e.g., would not rather have bread in his house than mice, gold than fleas? but there is little to wonder at in this, seeing that even when valued by [[men]] themselves (whose [[nature]] is certainly of the highest dignity), more is often given for a horse than for a [[slave]], for a jewel than for a maid. thus the [[reason]] of one contemplating [[nature]] prompts very different judgments [[judgment]] from those dictated by the necessity of the needy, or the [[desire]] of the voluptuous; for the former considers what value a thing in itself has in the scale of creation, while necessity considers how it meets its need; [[reason]] looks for what the mental [[light]] will [[judge]] to be true, while [[pleasure]] looks for what pleasantly titillates the bodily sense. but of such consequence in [[rational]] natures [[nature]] is the weight, so to speak, of will and of [[love]], that though in the order of [[nature]] angels rank above [[men]], yet, by the scale of [[justice]], [[good]] [[men]] are of greater value than [[bad]] angels.

17. that the flaw of wickedness is not [[nature]], but contrary to [[nature]], and has its origin, not in the creator, but in the will.

it is with reference to the [[nature]], then, and not to the wickedness of the [[devil]], that we are to [[understand]] these words, "this is the beginning of god's handiwork;"[480] for, without [[doubt]], wickedness can be a flaw or vice[481] only where the [[nature]] previously was not vitiated. [[vice]], too, is so contrary to [[nature]], that it cannot but damage it. and therefore departure from [[god]] would be no [[vice]], unless in a [[nature]] whose [[property]] it was to abide with [[god]]. so that even the wicked will is a [[strong]] proof of the goodness of the [[nature]]. but [[god]], as he is the supremely [[good]] creator of [[good]] natures [[nature]], so is he of [[evil]] wills the most just ruler; so that, while they make an ill use of [[good]] natures [[nature]], he makes a [[good]] use even of [[evil]] wills. accordingly, he caused the [[devil]] (good by god's creation, wicked by his own will) to be cast down from his high position, and to become the mockery of his angels,—that is, he caused his temptations to benefit those whom he wishes [[wish]] to injure by them. and because [[god]], when[pg 457] he created him, was certainly not ignorant of his future malignity, and foresaw the [[good]] which he himself would bring out of his [[evil]], therefore says the psalm, "this leviathan whom thou hast made to be a [[sport]] therein,"[482] that we may see that, even while [[god]] in his goodness created him [[good]], he yet had already foreseen and arranged how he would make use of him when he became wicked.

18. of the [[beauty]] of the [[universe]], which becomes, by god's ordinance, more brilliant by the opposition of contraries.

for [[god]] would never have created any, i do not say angel, but even [[man]], whose future wickedness he foreknew, unless he had equally known to what uses in behalf of the [[good]] he could turn him, thus embellishing the course of the ages [[age]], as it were an exquisite poem set off with antitheses. for what are called antitheses are among the most elegant of the ornaments of [[speech]]. they might be called in latin "oppositions," or, to speak more accurately, "contrapositions;" but this word is not in [[common]] use among us,[483] though the latin, and indeed the languages [[language]] of all nations, avail themselves of the same ornaments of style. in the second epistle to the corinthians the apostle paul also makes a graceful use of antithesis, in that place where he says, "by the armour of [[righteousness]] on the [[right]] hand and on the left, by [[honour]] and dishonour, by [[evil]] report and [[good]] report: as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we [[live]]; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as [[poor]], yet making many [[rich]]; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."[484] as, then, these oppositions of contraries lend [[beauty]] to the [[language]], so the [[beauty]] of the course of this [[world]] is achieved by the opposition of contraries, arranged, as it were, by an eloquence not of words, but of things. this is quite plainly stated in the [[book]] of ecclesiasticus, in this way: "good is set against [[evil]], and [[life]] against [[death]]: so is the sinner against the godly. so look upon all the works [[work]] of the most high, and these are two and two, one against another."[485]

[pg 458]

19. what, seemingly, we are to [[understand]] by the words, "god divided the [[light]] from the darkness."

accordingly, though the obscurity of the [[divine]] word has certainly this advantage, that it causes many opinions [[opinion]] about the [[truth]] to be started and discussed, each reader seeing some fresh meaning in it, yet, whatever is said to be meant by an obscure passage should be either confirmed by the testimony of obvious facts [[fact]], or should be asserted in other and less ambiguous texts. this obscurity is beneficial, whether the sense of the author is at [[last]] reached after the discussion of many other interpretations, or whether, though that sense remain concealed, other truths [[truth]] are brought out by the discussion of the obscurity. to me it does not seem incongruous with the working of [[god]], if we [[understand]] that the angels were created when that first [[light]] was made, and that a separation was made between the holy and the unclean angels, when, as is said, "god divided the [[light]] from the darkness; and [[god]] called the [[light]] day, and the darkness he called night." for he alone could make this discrimination, who was able also, before they fell, to foreknow that they would fall, and that, being deprived of the [[light]] of [[truth]], they would abide in the darkness of [[pride]]. for, so far as regards the day and night, with which we are familiar, he commanded those luminaries of [[heaven]] that are obvious to our senses to divide between the [[light]] and the darkness. "let there be," he says, "lights in the firmament of the [[heaven]], to divide the day from the night;" and shortly after he says, "and [[god]] made two [[great]] lights [[light]]; the greater [[light]] to [[rule]] the day, and the lesser [[light]] to [[rule]] the night: the stars also. and [[god]] set them in the firmament of the [[heaven]], to give [[light]] upon the [[earth]], and to [[rule]] over the day and over the night, and to divide the [[light]] from the darkness."[486] but between that [[light]], which is the holy company of the angels spiritually radiant with the illumination of the [[truth]], and that opposing darkness, which is the noisome foulness of the [[spiritual]] condition of those angels who are turned away from the [[light]] of [[righteousness]], only he himself could divide, from whom their wickedness (not of [[nature]], but of will), while yet it was future, could not be hidden or uncertain.

[pg 459]

20. of the words which [[follow]] the separation of [[light]] and darkness, "and [[god]] saw the [[light]] that it was [[good]]."

then, we must not pass from this passage of [[scripture]] without noticing that when [[god]] said, "let there be [[light]], and there was [[light]]," it was immediately added, "and [[god]] saw the [[light]] that it was [[good]]." no such expression followed the statement that he separated the [[light]] from the darkness, and called the [[light]] day and the darkness night, lest the seal of his approval might seem to be set on such darkness, as well as on the [[light]]. for when the darkness was not [[subject]] of disapprobation, as when it was divided by the heavenly bodies [[body]] from this [[light]] which our [[eyes]] discern, the statement that [[god]] saw that it was [[good]] is inserted, not before, but after the division is recorded. "and [[god]] set them," so runs the passage, "in the firmament of the [[heaven]], to give [[light]] upon the [[earth]], and to [[rule]] over the day and over the night, and to divide the [[light]] from the darkness: and [[god]] saw that it was [[good]]." for he approved of both, because both were sinless. but where [[god]] said, "let there be [[light]], and there was [[light]]; and [[god]] saw the [[light]] that it was [[good]];" and the narrative goes on, "and [[god]] divided the [[light]] from the darkness: and [[god]] called the [[light]] day, and the darkness he called night," there was not in this place subjoined the statement, "and [[god]] saw that it was [[good]]," lest both should be designated [[good]], while one of them was [[evil]], not by [[nature]], but by its own [[fault]]. and therefore, in this case, the [[light]] alone received the approbation of the creator, while the angelic darkness, though it had been ordained, was yet not approved.

21. of god's eternal and unchangeable [[knowledge]] and will, whereby all he has made pleased him in the eternal design as well as in the actual result.

for what else is to be understood by that invariable refrain, "and [[god]] saw that it was [[good]]," than the approval of the [[work]] in its design, which is the [[wisdom]] of [[god]]? for certainly [[god]] did not in the actual achievement of the [[work]] first learn that it was [[good]], but, on the contrary, nothing would have been made had it not been first known by him. while, therefore, he sees that that is [[good]] which, had he not seen it before it was made, would never have been made, it is plain that he is not discovering, but teaching that it is [[good]].[pg 460] [[plato]], indeed, was bold enough to say that, when the [[universe]] was completed, [[god]] was, as it were, elated with joy.[487] and [[plato]] was not so foolish as to mean by this that [[god]] was rendered more blessed by the novelty of his creation; but he wished thus to indicate that the [[work]] now completed met with its maker's approval, as it had while yet in design. it is not as if the [[knowledge]] of [[god]] were of various kinds [[kind]], knowing in different ways things which as yet are not, things which are, and things which have been. for not in our [[fashion]] does he look forward to what is future, nor at what is [[present]], nor back upon what is [[past]]; but in a manner quite different and far and profoundly remote from our way of thinking. for he does not pass from this to that by transition of [[thought]], but beholds all things with absolute unchangeableness; so that of those things which emerge in [[time]], the future, indeed, are not yet, and the [[present]] are now, and the [[past]] no longer are; but all of these are by him comprehended in his stable and eternal presence. neither does he see in one [[fashion]] by the eye, in another by the [[mind]], for he is not composed of [[mind]] and [[body]]; nor does his [[present]] [[knowledge]] differ from that which it ever was or shall be, for those variations of [[time]], [[past]], [[present]], and future, though they alter our [[knowledge]], do not affect his, "with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."[488] neither is there any [[growth]] from [[thought]] to [[thought]] in the conceptions of him whose [[spiritual]] vision all things which he knows [[know]] are at once embraced. for as without any movement that [[time]] can measure, he himself moves all temporal things, so he knows [[know]] all times [[time]] with a [[knowledge]] that [[time]] cannot measure. and therefore he saw that what he had made was [[good]], when he saw that it was [[good]] to make it. and when he saw it made, he had not on that account a twofold nor any way increased [[knowledge]] of it; as if he had less [[knowledge]] before he made what he saw. for certainly he would not be the perfect[pg 461] worker he is, unless his [[knowledge]] were so [[perfect]] as to receive no addition from his finished works [[work]]. wherefore, if the only object had been to inform us who made the [[light]], it had been enough to say, "god made the [[light]];" and if further information regarding the means by which it was made had been intended, it would have sufficed to say, "and [[god]] said, let there be [[light]], and there was [[light]]," that we might [[know]] not only that [[god]] had made the [[world]], but also that he had made it by the word. but because it was [[right]] that three leading truths [[truth]] regarding the creature be intimated to us, viz., who made it, by what means, and why, it is written, "god said, let there be [[light]], and there was [[light]]. and [[god]] saw the [[light]] that it was [[good]]." if, then, we ask who made it, it was "god." if, by what means, he said "let it be," and it was. if we ask, why he made it, "it was [[good]]." neither is there any author more excellent than [[god]], nor any [[skill]] more efficacious than the word of [[god]], nor any cause [[better]] than that [[good]] might be created by the [[good]] [[god]]. this also [[plato]] has assigned as the most sufficient [[reason]] for the creation of the [[world]], that [[good]] works [[work]] might be made by a [[good]] [[god]];[489] whether he [[read]] this passage, or, perhaps, was informed of these things by those who had [[read]] them, or, by his quick-sighted genius, penetrated to things [[spiritual]] and invisible through the things that are created, or was instructed regarding them by those who had discerned them.

22. of those who do not approve of [[certain]] things which are a part of this [[good]] creation of a [[good]] creator, and who [[think]] that there is some [[natural]] [[evil]].

this cause, however, of a [[good]] creation, namely, the goodness of [[god]],—this cause, i say, so just and fit, which, when piously and carefully weighed, terminates all the controversies of those who inquire into the origin of the [[world]], has not been recognised by some heretics,[490] because there are, forsooth, many things, such as [[fire]], frost, wild beasts, and so forth, which do not suit but injure this thin-blooded and frail [[mortality]] of our[pg 462] flesh, which is at [[present]] under just [[punishment]]. they do not consider how admirable these things are in their own places, how excellent in their own natures [[nature]], how beautifully adjusted to the rest of creation, and how much grace they contribute to the [[universe]] by their own contributions as to a commonwealth; and how serviceable they are even to ourselves, if we use them with a [[knowledge]] of their fit adaptations,—so that even poisons, which are destructive when used injudiciously, become wholesome and medicinal when used in conformity with their qualities and design; just as, on the other hand, those things which give us [[pleasure]], such as food, drink, and the [[light]] of the sun, are found to be hurtful when immoderately or unseasonably used. and thus [[divine]] providence admonishes us not foolishly to vituperate things, but to investigate their utility with [[care]]; and, where our mental capacity or infirmity is at [[fault]], to [[believe]] that there is a utility, though hidden, as we have experienced that there were other things which we all but failed to discover. for this concealment of the use of things is itself either an exercise of our [[humility]] or a levelling of our [[pride]]; for no [[nature]] at all is [[evil]], and this is a name for nothing but the want of [[good]]. but from things earthly to things heavenly, from the visible to the invisible, there are some things [[better]] than others; and for this [[purpose]] are they unequal, in order that they might all [[exist]]. now [[god]] is in such sort a [[great]] worker in [[great]] things, that he is not less in little things,—for these little things are to be measured not by their own greatness (which does not exist), but by the [[wisdom]] of their designer; as, in the visible appearance of a [[man]], if one eyebrow be shaved off, how nearly nothing is taken from the [[body]], but how much from the beauty!—for that is not constituted by bulk, but by the proportion and arrangement of the members. but we do not greatly wonder that persons [[person]], who suppose that some [[evil]] [[nature]] has been generated and propagated by a [[kind]] of opposing [[principle]] proper to it, refuse to admit that the cause of the creation was this, that the [[good]] [[god]] produced a [[good]] creation. for they [[believe]] that he was driven to this enterprise of creation by the urgent necessity of repulsing the [[evil]] that warred against him, and that he mixed his [[good]] nature[pg 463] with the [[evil]] for the sake of restraining and conquering it; and that this [[nature]] of his, being thus shamefully polluted, and most cruelly [[oppressed]] and held captive, he labours [[labour]] to cleanse and deliver it, and with all his pains [[pain]] does not wholly succeed; but such part of it as could not be cleansed from that defilement is to serve as a prison and chain of the conquered and incarcerated [[enemy]]. the manichæans would not drivel, or rather, rave in such a style as this, if they believed the [[nature]] of [[god]] to be, as it is, unchangeable and absolutely incorruptible, and [[subject]] to no injury; and if, moreover, they held in [[christian]] sobriety, that the [[soul]] which has shown itself capable of being altered for the worse by its own will, and of being corrupted by [[sin]], and so, of being deprived of the [[light]] of eternal [[truth]],—that this [[soul]], i say, is not a part of [[god]], nor of the same [[nature]] as [[god]], but is created by him, and is far different from its creator.

23. of the error in which the doctrine of origen is involved.

but it is much more surprising that some even of those who, with ourselves, [[believe]] that there is one only source of all things, and that no [[nature]] which is not [[divine]] can [[exist]] unless originated by that creator, have yet refused to accept with a [[good]] and simple [[faith]] this so [[good]] and simple a [[reason]] of the world's creation, that a [[good]] [[god]] made it [[good]]; and that the things created, being different from [[god]], were inferior to him, and yet were [[good]], being created by none other than he. but they say that souls [[soul]], though not, indeed, parts of [[god]], but created by him, sinned by abandoning [[god]]; that, in proportion to their various sins [[sin]], they merited different degrees [[degree]] of debasement from [[heaven]] to [[earth]], and diverse bodies [[body]] as prison-houses; and that this is the [[world]], and this the cause of its creation, not the production of [[good]] things, but the restraining of [[evil]]. origen is justly blamed for holding this [[opinion]]. for in the books [[book]] which he entitles περὶ ἀρχῶν, that is, of origins, this is his sentiment, this his utterance. and i cannot sufficiently express my astonishment, that a [[man]] so erudite and well versed in ecclesiastical literature, should not have observed, in the first place, how opposed this is to the meaning of this authoritative [[scripture]], which, in recounting all the works [[work]] of[pg 464] [[god]], regularly adds, "and [[god]] saw that it was [[good]];" and, when all were completed, inserts the words, "and [[god]] saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very [[good]]."[491] was it not obviously meant to be understood that there was no other cause of the world's creation than that [[good]] creatures should be made by a [[good]] [[god]]? in this creation, had no one sinned, the [[world]] would have been filled and beautified with natures [[nature]] [[good]] without exception; and though there is [[sin]], all things are not therefore full of [[sin]], for the [[great]] majority of the heavenly inhabitants preserve their nature's integrity. and the sinful will, though it violated the order of its own [[nature]], did not on that account escape the laws [[law]] of [[god]], who justly orders all things for [[good]]. for as the [[beauty]] of a picture is increased by well-managed shadows, so, to the eye that has [[skill]] to discern it, the [[universe]] is beautified even by sinners, though, considered by themselves, their deformity is a [[sad]] blemish.

in the second place, origen, and all who [[think]] with him, ought to have seen that if it were the true [[opinion]] that the [[world]] was created in order that souls [[soul]] might, for their sins [[sin]], be accommodated with bodies [[body]] in which they should be shut up as in houses of correction, the more venial sinners receiving lighter and more ethereal bodies [[body]], while the grosser and graver sinners received bodies [[body]] more crass and grovelling, then it would [[follow]] that the devils [[devil]], who are deepest in wickedness, ought, rather than even wicked [[men]], to have earthly bodies [[body]], since these are the grossest and least ethereal of all. but in point of [[fact]], that we might see that the deserts of souls [[soul]] are not to be estimated by the qualities of bodies [[body]], the wickedest [[devil]] possesses an ethereal [[body]], while [[man]], wicked, it is true, but with a wickedness small and venial in comparison with his, received even before his [[sin]] a [[body]] of clay. and what more foolish assertion can be advanced than that [[god]], by this sun of ours, did not design to benefit the material creation, or lend lustre to its loveliness, and therefore created one [[single]] sun for this [[single]] [[world]], but that it so happened that one [[soul]] only had so sinned as to deserve to be enclosed in such a [[body]] as it is? on this [[principle]], if it had chanced that not[pg 465] one, but two, yea, or ten, or a hundred had sinned similarly, and with a like [[degree]] of guilt, then this [[world]] would have one hundred suns. and that such is not the case, is due not to the considerate foresight of the creator, contriving the safety and [[beauty]] of things material, but rather to the [[fact]] that so fine a quality of sinning was hit upon by only one [[soul]], so that it alone has merited such a [[body]]. manifestly persons [[person]] holding such opinions [[opinion]] should aim at confining, not souls [[soul]] of which they [[know]] not what they say, but themselves, lest they fall, and deservedly, far indeed from the [[truth]]. and as to these three answers [[answer]] which i formerly recommended when in the case of any creature the questions [[question]] are put, who made it? by what means? why? that it should be replied, [[god]], by the word, because it was [[good]],—as to these three answers [[answer]], it is very questionable whether the trinity itself is thus mystically indicated, that is, the [[father]], the [[son]], and the holy ghost, or whether there is some [[good]] [[reason]] for this acceptation in this passage of [[scripture]],—this, i say, is questionable, and one can't be expected to explain everything in one volume.

24. of the [[divine]] trinity, and the indications of its presence scattered everywhere among its works [[work]].

we [[believe]], we maintain, we faithfully preach, that the [[father]] begat the word, that is, [[wisdom]], by which all things were made, the only-begotten [[son]], one as the [[father]] is one, eternal as the [[father]] is eternal, and, equally with the [[father]], supremely [[good]]; and that the holy spirit is the spirit alike of [[father]] and of [[son]], and is himself consubstantial and co-eternal with both; and that this whole is a trinity by [[reason]] of the individuality[492] of the persons [[person]], and one [[god]] by [[reason]] of the indivisible [[divine]] substance, as also one almighty by [[reason]] of the indivisible omnipotence; yet so that, when we inquire regarding each singly, it is said that each is [[god]] and almighty; and, when we speak of all together, it is said that there are not three gods, nor three almighties, but one [[god]] almighty; so [[great]] is the indivisible unity of these three, which requires that it be so stated. but, whether the holy spirit of the [[father]], and of the [[son]], who are both [[good]], can be with propriety called the goodness of both, because[pg 466] he is [[common]] to both, i do not presume to determine hastily. nevertheless, i would have less hesitation in saying that he is the holiness of both, not as if he were a [[divine]] attribute merely, but himself also the [[divine]] substance, and the third [[person]] in the trinity. i am the rather emboldened to make this statement, because, though the [[father]] is a spirit, and the [[son]] a spirit, and the [[father]] holy, and the [[son]] holy, yet the third [[person]] is distinctively called the holy spirit, as if he were the substantial holiness consubstantial with the other two. but if the [[divine]] goodness is nothing else than the [[divine]] holiness, then certainly it is a reasonable studiousness, and not presumptuous intrusion, to inquire whether the same trinity be not hinted at in an enigmatical mode of [[speech]], by which our inquiry is stimulated, when it is written who made each creature, and by what means, and why. for it is the [[father]] of the word who said, let there be. and that which was made when he spoke was certainly made by means of the word. and by the words, "god saw that it was [[good]]," it is sufficiently intimated that [[god]] made what was made not from any necessity, nor for the sake of supplying any want, but solely from his own goodness, i.e., because it was [[good]]. and this is stated after the creation had taken place, that there might be no [[doubt]] that the thing made satisfied the goodness on account of which it was made. and if we are [[right]] in understanding that this goodness is the holy spirit, then the whole trinity is revealed to us in the creation. in this, too, is the origin, the enlightenment, the blessedness of the holy [[city]] which is above among the holy angels. for if we inquire whence it is, [[god]] created it; or whence its [[wisdom]], [[god]] illumined it; or whence its blessedness, [[god]] is its bliss. it has its form by subsisting in him; its enlightenment by contemplating him; its joy by abiding in him. it is; it sees; it loves [[love]]. in god's eternity is its [[life]]; in god's [[truth]] its [[light]]; in god's goodness its joy.

25. of the division of [[philosophy]] into three parts.

as far as one can [[judge]], it is for the same [[reason]] that [[philosophers]] have aimed at a threefold division of [[science]], or rather, were enabled to see that there was a threefold division[pg 467] (for they did not invent, but only discovered it), of which one part is called physical, another logical, the third ethical. the latin equivalents of these names are now naturalized in the writings of many authors, so that these divisions are called [[natural]], [[rational]], and [[moral]], on which i have touched slightly in the eighth [[book]]. not that i would conclude that these [[philosophers]], in this threefold division, had any [[thought]] of a trinity in [[god]], although [[plato]] is said to have been the first to discover and promulgate this distribution, and he saw that [[god]] alone could be the author of [[nature]], the bestower of [[intelligence]], and the kindler of [[love]] by which [[life]] becomes [[good]] and blessed. but [[certain]] it is that, though [[philosophers]] disagree both regarding the [[nature]] of things, and the mode of investigating [[truth]], and of the [[good]] to which all our actions ought to tend, yet in these three [[great]] general questions [[question]] all their intellectual energy is spent. and though there be a confusing [[diversity]] of [[opinion]], every [[man]] striving to establish his own [[opinion]] in regard to each of these questions [[question]], yet no one of them all doubts [[doubt]] that [[nature]] has some cause, [[science]] some method, [[life]] some end and aim. then, again, there are three things which every artificer must possess if he is to effect anything,—nature, [[education]], practice. [[nature]] is to be judged by capacity, [[education]] by [[knowledge]], practice by its fruit. i am aware that, properly speaking, fruit is what one enjoys, use [practice] what one uses. and this seems to be the difference between them, that we are said to enjoy that which in itself, and irrespective of other ends, delights us; to use that which we seek for the sake of some end beyond. for which [[reason]] the things of [[time]] are to be used rather than enjoyed, that we may deserve to enjoy things eternal; and not as those perverse creatures who would fain enjoy [[money]] and use [[god]],—not spending [[money]] for god's sake, but worshipping [[god]] for money's sake. however, in [[common]] parlance, we both use fruits and enjoy uses. for we correctly speak of the "fruits of the field," which certainly we all use in the [[present]] [[life]]. and it was in accordance with this usage that i said that there were three things to be observed in a [[man]], [[nature]], [[education]], practice. from these the [[philosophers]] have elaborated, as i said, the threefold division of that [[science]] by[pg 468] which a blessed [[life]] is attained: the [[natural]] having [[respect]] to [[nature]], the [[rational]] to [[education]], the [[moral]] to practice. if, then, we were ourselves the authors of our [[nature]], we should have generated [[knowledge]] in ourselves, and should not require to reach it by [[education]], i.e., by learning it from others. our [[love]], too, proceeding from ourselves and returning to us, would suffice to make our [[life]] blessed, and would stand in need of no extraneous enjoyment. but now, since our [[nature]] has [[god]] as its requisite author, it is [[certain]] that we must have him for our teacher that we may be [[wise]]; him, too, to dispense to us [[spiritual]] sweetness that we may be blessed.

26. of the image of the supreme trinity, which we find in some sort in [[human]] [[nature]] even in its [[present]] [[state]].

and we indeed recognise in ourselves the image of [[god]], that is, of the supreme trinity, an image which, though it be not [[equal]] to [[god]], or rather, though it be very far removed from him,—being neither co-eternal, nor, to say all in a word, consubstantial with him,—is yet nearer to him in [[nature]] than any other of his works [[work]], and is destined to be yet restored, that it may bear a still closer resemblance. for we both are, and [[know]] that we are, and delight in our being, and our [[knowledge]] of it. moreover, in these three things no true-seeming illusion disturbs us; for we do not come into contact with these by some bodily sense, as we perceive the things outside of us,—colours, e.g., by seeing, sounds by hearing, smells by smelling, tastes by tasting, hard and soft objects by touching,—of all which sensible objects it is the images resembling them, but not themselves which we perceive in the [[mind]] and hold in the memory, and which excite us to [[desire]] the objects. but, without any delusive representation of images or phantasms, i am most [[certain]] that i am, and that i [[know]] and delight in this. in [[respect]] of these truths [[truth]], i am not at all afraid of the arguments of the academicians, who say, what if you are deceived? for if i am deceived, i am.[493] for he who is not, cannot be deceived; and if i am[pg 469] deceived, by this same token i am. and since i am if i am deceived, how am i deceived in believing that i am? for it is [[certain]] that i am if i am deceived. since, therefore, i, the [[person]] deceived, should be, even if i were deceived, certainly i am not deceived in this [[knowledge]] that i am. and, consequently, neither am i deceived in knowing that i [[know]]. for, as i [[know]] that i am, so i [[know]] this also, that i [[know]]. and when i [[love]] these two things, i add to them a [[certain]] third thing, namely, my [[love]], which is of [[equal]] moment. for neither am i deceived in this, that i [[love]], since in those things which i [[love]] i am not deceived; though even if these were false, it would still be true that i loved false things. for how could i justly be blamed and prohibited from loving false things, if it were false that i loved them? but, since they are true and real, who doubts [[doubt]] that when they are loved, the [[love]] of them is itself true and real? further, as there is no one who does not [[wish]] to be [[happy]], so there is no one who does not [[wish]] to be. for how can he be [[happy]], if he is nothing?

27. of existence, and [[knowledge]] of it, and the [[love]] of both.

and truly the very [[fact]] of existing is by some [[natural]] spell so pleasant, that even the wretched are, for no other [[reason]], unwilling to perish; and, when they [[feel]] that they are wretched, [[wish]] not that they themselves be annihilated, but that their misery be so. take even those who, both in their own esteem, and in point of [[fact]], are utterly wretched, and who are reckoned so, not only by [[wise]] [[men]] on account of their folly, but by those who count themselves blessed, and who [[think]] them wretched because they are [[poor]] and destitute,—if any one should give these [[men]] an immortality, in which their misery should be deathless, and should offer the alternative, that if they shrank from existing eternally in the same misery they might be annihilated, and [[exist]] nowhere at all, nor in any condition, on the instant they would joyfully, nay exultantly, make election to [[exist]] always, even in such a condition, rather than not [[exist]] at all. the well-known feeling of such [[men]] witnesses to this. for when we see that they [[fear]] to [[die]], and will rather [[live]] in such misfortune than end it by [[death]], is it not obvious enough how[pg 470] [[nature]] shrinks from annihilation? and, accordingly, when they [[know]] that they must [[die]], they seek, as a [[great]] boon, that this [[mercy]] be shown them, that they may a little longer [[live]] in the same misery, and delay to end it by [[death]]. and so they indubitably prove with what glad alacrity they would accept immortality, even though it secured to them endless destruction. what! do not even all irrational animals, to whom such calculations are unknown, from the huge dragons down to the least worms, all testify that they [[wish]] to [[exist]], and therefore shun [[death]] by every movement in their [[power]]? nay, the very plants and shrubs, which have no such [[life]] as enables them to shun destruction by movements we can see, do not they all seek, in their own [[fashion]], to conserve their existence, by rooting themselves more and more deeply in the [[earth]], that so they may draw nourishment, and throw out healthy branches towards the [[sky]]? in fine, even the lifeless bodies [[body]], which want not only sensation but seminal [[life]], yet either seek the upper air or sink deep, or are balanced in an intermediate position, so that they may [[protect]] their existence in that situation where they can [[exist]] in most accordance with their [[nature]].

and how much [[human]] [[nature]] loves [[love]] the [[knowledge]] of its existence, and how it shrinks from being deceived, will be sufficiently understood from this [[fact]], that every [[man]] prefers to grieve in a sane [[mind]], rather than to be glad in madness. and this grand and wonderful instinct belongs to [[men]] alone of all animals; for, though some of them have keener eyesight than ourselves for this world's [[light]], they cannot attain to that [[spiritual]] [[light]] with which our [[mind]] is somehow irradiated, so that we can form [[right]] judgments [[judgment]] of all things. for our [[power]] to [[judge]] is proportioned to our acceptance of this [[light]]. nevertheless, the irrational animals, though they have not [[knowledge]], have certainly something resembling [[knowledge]]; whereas the other material things are said to be sensible, not because they have senses, but because they are the objects of our senses. yet among plants, their nourishment and [[generation]] have some resemblance to sensible [[life]]. however, both these and all material things have their causes hidden in their [[nature]]; but their outward forms, which lend [[beauty]] to this[pg 471] visible structure of the [[world]], are perceived by our senses, so that they seem to [[wish]] to compensate for their own want of [[knowledge]] by providing us with [[knowledge]]. but we perceive them by our bodily senses in such a way that we do not [[judge]] of them by these senses. for we have another and far superior sense, belonging to the inner [[man]], by which we perceive what things are just, and what [[unjust]],—just by means of an intelligible [[idea]], [[unjust]] by the want of it. this sense is aided in its functions neither by the eyesight, nor by the orifice of the ear, nor by the air-holes of the nostrils, nor by the palate's taste, nor by any bodily touch. by it i am assured both that i am, and that i [[know]] this; and these two i [[love]], and in the same manner i am assured that i [[love]] them.

28. whether we ought to [[love]] the [[love]] itself with which we [[love]] our existence and our [[knowledge]] of it, that so we may more nearly resemble the image of the [[divine]] trinity.

we have said as much as the scope of this [[work]] demands regarding these two things, to wit, our existence, and our [[knowledge]] of it, and how much they are loved by us, and how there is found even in the lower creatures a [[kind]] of likeness of these things, and yet with a difference. we have yet to speak of the [[love]] wherewith they are loved, to determine whether this [[love]] itself is loved. and doubtless it is; and this is the proof. because in [[men]] who are justly loved, it is rather [[love]] itself that is loved; for he is not justly called a [[good]] [[man]] who knows [[know]] what is [[good]], but who loves [[love]] it. is it not then obvious that we [[love]] in ourselves the very [[love]] wherewith we [[love]] whatever [[good]] we [[love]]? for there is also a [[love]] wherewith we [[love]] that which we ought not to [[love]]; and this [[love]] is hated by him who loves [[love]] that wherewith he loves [[love]] what ought to be loved. for it is quite possible for both to [[exist]] in one [[man]]. and this co-existence is [[good]] for a [[man]], to the end that this [[love]] which conduces to our living well may grow, and the other, which leads us to [[evil]] may decrease, until our whole [[life]] be perfectly healed and transmuted into [[good]]. for if we were beasts, we should [[love]] the fleshly and sensual [[life]], and this would be our sufficient [[good]]; and when it was well with us in [[respect]] of[pg 472] it, we should seek nothing beyond. in like manner, if we were trees, we could not, indeed, in the strict sense of the word, [[love]] anything; nevertheless we should seem, as it were, to long for that by which we might become more abundantly and luxuriantly fruitful. if we were stones, or waves, or wind, or flame, or anything of that [[kind]], we should want, indeed, both sensation and [[life]], yet should possess a [[kind]] of attraction towards our own proper position and [[natural]] order. for the specific gravity of bodies [[body]] is, as it were, their [[love]], whether they are carried downwards by their weight, or upwards by their levity. for the [[body]] is borne by its gravity, as the spirit by [[love]], whithersoever it is borne.[494] but we are [[men]], created in the image of our creator, whose eternity is true, and whose [[truth]] is eternal, whose [[love]] is eternal and true, and who himself is the eternal, true, and adorable trinity, without confusion, without separation; and, therefore, while, as we run over all the works [[work]] which he has established, we may detect, as it were, his footprints, now more and now less distinct even in those things that are beneath us, since they could not so much as [[exist]], or be bodied forth in any shape, or [[follow]] and observe any [[law]], had they not been made by him who supremely is, and is supremely [[good]] and supremely [[wise]]; yet in ourselves beholding his image, let us, like that younger [[son]] of the gospel, come to ourselves, and arise and return to him from whom by our [[sin]] we had departed. there our being will have no [[death]], our [[knowledge]] no error, our [[love]] no mishap. but now, though we are assured of our possession of these three things, not on the testimony of others, but by our own [[consciousness]] of their presence, and because we see them with our own most truthful interior vision, yet, as we cannot of ourselves [[know]] how long they are to continue, and whether they shall never cease to be, and what issue their [[good]] or [[bad]] use will lead to, we seek for others who can acquaint us of these things, if we have not already found them. of the trustworthiness of these witnesses, there will, not now, but subsequently, be an opportunity of speaking. but in this [[book]] let us go on as we have begun, with god's [[help]], to speak of the [[city]] of [[god]], not in its [[state]] of pilgrimage[pg 473] and [[mortality]], but as it exists ever [[immortal]] in the heavens [[heaven]],—that is, let us speak of the holy angels who maintain their allegiance to [[god]], who never were, nor ever shall be, apostate, between whom and those who forsook [[light]] eternal and became darkness, [[god]], as we have already said, made at the first a separation.

29. of the [[knowledge]] by which the holy angels [[know]] [[god]] in his essence, and by which they see the causes of his works [[work]] in the art [[arts]] of the worker, before they see them in the works [[work]] of the artist.

those holy angels come to the [[knowledge]] of [[god]] not by audible words, but by the presence to their souls [[soul]] of immutable [[truth]], i.e., of the only-begotten word of [[god]]; and they [[know]] this word himself, and the [[father]], and their holy spirit, and that this trinity is indivisible, and that the three persons [[person]] of it are one substance, and that there are not three gods but one [[god]]; and this they so [[know]], that it is [[better]] understood by them than we are by ourselves. thus, too, they [[know]] the creature also, not in itself, but by this [[better]] way, in the [[wisdom]] of [[god]], as if in the art [[arts]] by which it was created; and, consequently, they [[know]] themselves [[better]] in [[god]] than in themselves, though they have also this latter [[knowledge]]. for they were created, and are different from their creator. in him, therefore, they have, as it were, a noonday [[knowledge]]; in themselves, a twilight [[knowledge]], according to our former explanations.[495] for there is a [[great]] difference between knowing a thing in the design in conformity to which it was made, and knowing it in itself,—e.g., the straightness of lines and correctness of figures is known in one way when mentally conceived, in another when described on paper; and [[justice]] is known in one way in the unchangeable [[truth]], in another in the spirit of a just [[man]]. so is it with all other things,—as, the firmament between the water above and below, which was called the [[heaven]]; the gathering of the waters beneath, and the laying bare of the dry [[land]], and the production of plants and trees; the creation of sun, moon, and stars; and of the animals out of the waters, fowls, and fish, and monsters of the deep; and of everything that walks or creeps on the [[earth]], and of [[man]] himself, who[pg 474] excels all that is on the [[earth]],—all these things are known in one way by the angels in the word of [[god]], in which they see the eternally abiding causes and reasons [[reason]] according to which they were made, and in another way in themselves: in the former, with a clearer [[knowledge]]; in the latter, with a [[knowledge]] dimmer, and rather of the bare works [[work]] than of the design. yet, when these works [[work]] are referred to the [[praise]] and adoration of the creator himself, it is as if morning dawned in the minds [[mind]] of those who contemplate them.

30. of the [[perfection]] of the number six, which is the first of the numbers which is composed of its aliquot parts.

these works [[work]] are recorded to have been completed in six days (the same day being six times [[time]] repeated), because six is a [[perfect]] number,—not because [[god]] required a protracted [[time]], as if he could not at once create all things, which then should mark the course of [[time]] by the movements proper to them, but because the [[perfection]] of the works [[work]] was signified by the number six. for the number six is the first which is made up of its own[496] parts, i.e., of its sixth, third, and half, which are respectively one, two, and three, and which make a total of six. in this way of looking at a number, those are said to be its parts which exactly divide it, as a half, a third, a fourth, or a fraction with any denominator,—e.g., four is a part of nine, but not therefore an aliquot part; but one is, for it is the ninth part; and three is, for it is the third. yet these two parts, the ninth and the third, or one and three, are far from making its whole sum of nine. so again, in the number ten, four is a part, yet does not divide it; but one is an aliquot part, for it is a tenth; so it has a fifth, which is two; and a half, which is five. but these three parts, a tenth, a fifth, and a half, or one, two, and five, added together, do not make ten, but eight. of the number twelve, again, the parts added together exceed the whole; for it has a twelfth, that is, one; a sixth, or two; a fourth, which is three; a third, which is four; and a half, which is six. but one, two, three, four, and six make up, not twelve, but more, viz. sixteen. so much i have [[thought]] fit to [[state]] for the sake of illustrating the [[perfection]] of the number six, which is, as i said, the first which[pg 475] is exactly made up of its own parts added together; and in this number of days [[god]] finished his [[work]].[497] and, therefore, we must not despise the [[science]] of numbers, which, in many passages of holy [[scripture]], is found to be of eminent service to the careful interpreter.[498] neither has it been without [[reason]] numbered among god's praises [[praise]], "thou hast ordered all things in number, and measure, and weight."[499]

31. of the seventh day, in which completeness and repose are celebrated.

but, on the seventh day (i.e., the same day repeated seven times [[time]], which number is also a [[perfect]] one, though for another reason), the rest of [[god]] is set forth, and then, too, we first hear of its being hallowed. so that [[god]] did not [[wish]] to hallow this day by his works [[work]], but by his rest, which has no evening, for it is not a creature; so that, being known in one way in the word of [[god]], and in another in itself, it should make a twofold [[knowledge]], daylight and dusk (day and evening). much more might be said about the [[perfection]] of the number seven, but this [[book]] is already too long, and i [[fear]] lest i should seem to catch at an opportunity of airing my little smattering of [[science]] more childishly than profitably. i must speak, therefore, in moderation and with [[dignity]], lest, in too keenly following "number," i be accused of forgetting "weight" and "measure." suffice it here to say, that three is the first whole number that is odd, four the first that is even, and of these two, seven is composed. on this account it is often put for all numbers together, as, "a just [[man]] falleth seven times [[time]], and riseth up again,"[500]—that is, let him fall never so often, he will not perish (and this was meant to be understood not of sins [[sin]], but of afflictions conducing to lowliness). again, "seven times [[time]] a day will i [[praise]] thee,"[501] which elsewhere is expressed thus, "i will bless the [[lord]] at all times [[time]]."[502] and many such instances are found in the [[divine]] authorities [[authority]], in which the number seven is, as i said, commonly used to express the whole, or the completeness of anything.[pg 476] and so the holy spirit, of whom the [[lord]] says, "he will [[teach]] you all [[truth]],"[503] is signified by this number.[504] in it is the rest of [[god]], the rest his [[people]] find in him. for rest is in the whole, i.e. in [[perfect]] completeness, while in the part there is [[labour]]. and thus we [[labour]] as long as we [[know]] in part; "but when that which is [[perfect]] is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."[505] it is even with toil we search into the scriptures [[scripture]] themselves. but the holy angels, towards whose [[society]] and assembly we sigh while in this our toilsome pilgrimage, as they already abide in their eternal [[home]], so do they enjoy [[perfect]] facility of [[knowledge]] and felicity of rest. it is without difficulty that they [[help]] us; for their [[spiritual]] movements, pure and [[free]], cost them no effort.

32. of the [[opinion]] that the angels were created before the [[world]].

but if some one oppose our [[opinion]], and say that the holy angels are not referred to when it is said, "let there be [[light]], and there was [[light]];" if he suppose or [[teach]] that some material [[light]], then first created, was meant, and that the angels were created, not only before the firmament dividing the waters and named "the [[heaven]]," but also before the [[time]] signified in the words, "in the beginning [[god]] created the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]];" if he allege that this phrase, "in the beginning," does not mean that nothing was made before (for the angels were), but that [[god]] made all things by his [[wisdom]] or word, who is named in [[scripture]] "the beginning," as he himself, in the gospel, replied to the [[jews]] when they [[asked]] him who he was, that he was the beginning;[506]—i will not contest the point, chiefly because it gives me the liveliest satisfaction to find the trinity celebrated in the very beginning of the [[book]] of genesis. for, having said, "in the beginning [[god]] created the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]," meaning that the [[father]] made them in the [[son]] (as the psalm testifies where it says, "how manifold are thy works [[work]], o lord! in wisdom[pg 477] hast thou made them all"[507]), a little afterwards mention is fitly made of the holy spirit also. for, when it had been told us what [[kind]] of [[earth]] [[god]] created at first, or what the mass or matter was which [[god]], under the name of "heaven and [[earth]]," had provided for the construction of the [[world]], as is told in the additional words, "and the [[earth]] was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep," then, for the sake of completing the mention of the trinity, it is immediately added, "and the spirit of [[god]] moved upon the face of the waters." let each one, then, take it as he pleases; for it is so profound a passage, that it may well suggest, for the exercise of the reader's tact, many opinions [[opinion]], and none of them widely departing from the [[rule]] of [[faith]]. at the same [[time]], let none [[doubt]] that the holy angels in their heavenly abodes are, though not, indeed, co-eternal with [[god]], yet secure and [[certain]] of eternal and true felicity. to their company the [[lord]] teaches [[teach]] that his little ones belong; and not only says, "they shall be [[equal]] to the angels of [[god]],"[508] but shows, too, what blessed contemplation the angels themselves enjoy, saying, "take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones: for i say unto you, that in [[heaven]] their angels do always behold the face of my [[father]] which is in [[heaven]]."[509]

33. of the two different and dissimilar communities [[community]] of angels, which are not inappropriately signified by the names [[light]] and darkness.

that [[certain]] angels sinned, and were thrust down to the lowest parts of this [[world]], where they are, as it were, incarcerated till their final damnation in the day of [[judgment]], the apostle peter very plainly declares, when he says that "god spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto [[judgment]]."[510] who, then, can [[doubt]] that [[god]], either in foreknowledge or in act, separated between these and the rest? and who will dispute that the rest are justly called "light?" for even we who are yet living by [[faith]], hoping only and not yet enjoying equality with them, are already called "light" by the apostle: "for ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye [[light]] in the [[lord]]."[511] but as for these apostate angels, all[pg 478] who [[understand]] or [[believe]] them to be worse than unbelieving [[men]] are well aware that they are called "darkness." wherefore, though [[light]] and darkness are to be taken in their literal signification in these passages of genesis in which it is said, "god said, let there be [[light]], and there was [[light]]," and "god divided the [[light]] from the darkness," yet, for our part, we [[understand]] these two societies [[society]] of angels,—the one enjoying [[god]], the other swelling with [[pride]]; the one to whom it is said, "praise ye him, all his angels,"[512] the other whose [[prince]] says, "all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and [[worship]] me;"[513] the one blazing with the holy [[love]] of [[god]], the other reeking with the unclean [[lust]] of self-advancement. and since, as it is written, "god resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble,"[514] we may say, the one dwelling in the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]], the other cast thence, and raging through the lower regions of the air; the one tranquil in the brightness of piety, the other tempest-tossed with beclouding desires [[desire]]; the one, at god's [[pleasure]], tenderly succouring, justly avenging,—the other, set on by its own [[pride]], boiling with the [[lust]] of subduing and hurting; the one the minister of god's goodness to the utmost of their [[good]] [[pleasure]], the other held in by god's [[power]] from doing the harm it would; the former laughing at the latter when it does [[good]] unwillingly by its persecutions, the latter envying the former when it gathers in its pilgrims. these two angelic communities [[community]], then, dissimilar and contrary to one another, the one both by [[nature]] [[good]] and by will upright, the other also [[good]] by [[nature]] but by will depraved, as they are exhibited in other and more explicit passages of holy writ, so i [[think]] they are spoken of in this [[book]] of genesis under the names of [[light]] and darkness; and even if the author perhaps had a different meaning, yet our discussion of the obscure [[language]] has not been wasted [[time]]; for, though we have been unable to discover his meaning, yet we have adhered to the [[rule]] of [[faith]], which is sufficiently ascertained by the faithful from other passages of [[equal]] [[authority]]. for, though it is the material works [[work]] of [[god]] which are here spoken of, they have certainly a resemblance to the [[spiritual]], so that paul can say, "ye are all the [[children]] of [[light]], and[pg 479] the [[children]] of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."[515] if, on the other hand, the author of genesis saw in the words what we see, then our discussion reaches this more satisfactory conclusion, that the [[man]] of [[god]], so eminently and divinely [[wise]], or rather, that the spirit of [[god]] who by him recorded god's works [[work]] which were finished on the sixth day, may be supposed not to have omitted all mention of the angels, whether he included them in the words "in the beginning," because he made them first, or, which seems most likely, because he made them in the only-begotten word. and, under these names [[heaven]] and [[earth]], the whole creation is signified, either as divided into [[spiritual]] and material, which seems the more likely, or into the two [[great]] parts of the [[world]] in which all created things are contained, so that, first of all, the creation is presented in sum, and then its parts are enumerated according to the mystic number of the days.

34. of the [[idea]] that the angels were meant where the separation of the waters by the firmament is spoken of, and of that other [[idea]] that the waters were not created.

some,[516] however, have supposed that the angelic hosts are somehow referred to under the name of waters, and that this is what is meant by, "let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters:"[517] that the waters above should be understood of the angels, and those below either of the visible waters, or of the multitude of [[bad]] angels, or of the nations of [[men]]. if this be so, then it does not here appear when the angels were created, but when they were separated. though there have not been wanting [[men]] foolish and wicked enough[518] to deny that the waters were made by [[god]], because it is nowhere written, "god said, let there be waters." with [[equal]] folly they might say the same of the [[earth]], for nowhere do we [[read]], "god said, let the [[earth]] be." but, say they, it is written, "in the beginning [[god]] created the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]."[pg 480] yes, and there the water is meant, for both are included in one word. for "the sea is his," as the psalm says, "and he made it; and his hands formed the dry [[land]]."[519] but those who would [[understand]] the angels by the waters above the skies [[sky]] have a difficulty about the specific gravity of the elements, and [[fear]] that the waters, owing to their fluidity and weight, could not be set in the upper parts of the [[world]]. so that, if they were to construct a [[man]] upon their own principles [[principle]], they would not put in his head any moist humours [[humour]], or "phlegm" as the greeks [[greek]] call it, and which acts the part of water among the elements of our [[body]]. but, in god's handiwork, the head is the seat of the phlegm, and surely most fitly; and yet, according to their supposition, so absurdly that if we were not aware of the [[fact]], and were informed by this same record that [[god]] had put a moist and cold and therefore heavy [[humour]] in the uppermost part of man's [[man]] [[body]], these world-weighers would refuse [[belief]]. and if they were confronted with the [[authority]] of [[scripture]], they would maintain that something else must be meant by the words. but, were we to investigate and discover all the details which are written in this [[divine]] [[book]] regarding the creation of the [[world]], we should have much to say, and should widely digress from the proposed aim of this [[work]]. since, then, we have now said what seemed needful regarding these two diverse and contrary communities [[community]] of angels, in which the origin of the two [[human]] communities [[community]] (of which we intend to speak anon) is also found, let us at once bring this [[book]] also to a conclusion.

[pg 481]

book twelfth.

argument.

augustine first institutes two inquiries regarding the angels; namely, whence is there in some a [[good]], and in others an [[evil]] will? and, what is the [[reason]] of the blessedness of the [[good]], and the misery of the [[evil]]? afterwards he treats of the creation of [[man]], and teaches [[teach]] that he is not from eternity, but was created, and by none other than [[god]].

1. that the [[nature]] of the angels, both [[good]] and [[bad]], is one and the same.

it has already, in the preceding [[book]], been shown how the two cities [[city]] originated among the angels. before i speak of the creation of [[man]], and show how the cities [[city]] took their rise, so far as regards the [[race]] of [[rational]] mortals, i see that i must first, so far as i can, adduce what may demonstrate that it is not incongruous and unsuitable to speak of a [[society]] composed of angels and [[men]] together; so that there are not four cities [[city]] or societies [[society]],—two, namely, of angels, and as many of [[men]],—but rather two in all, one composed of the [[good]], the other of the wicked, angels or [[men]] indifferently.

that the contrary propensities in [[good]] and [[bad]] angels have arisen, not from a difference in their [[nature]] and origin, since [[god]], the [[good]] author and creator of all essences, created them both, but from a difference in their wills and desires [[desire]], it is impossible to [[doubt]]. while some stedfastly continued in that which was the [[common]] [[good]] of all, namely, in [[god]] himself, and in his eternity, [[truth]], and [[love]]; others, being enamoured rather of their own [[power]], as if they could be their own [[good]], lapsed to this private [[good]] of their own, from that higher and beatific [[good]] which was [[common]] to all, and, bartering the lofty [[dignity]] of eternity for the inflation of [[pride]], the most assured verity for the slyness of vanity, uniting [[love]] for factious partisanship, they became proud, deceived, envious. the cause, therefore, of the blessedness of the [[good]] is adherence to [[god]]. and so the cause of the others' misery will be found in the contrary,[pg 482] that is, in their not adhering to [[god]]. wherefore, if when the [[question]] is [[asked]], why are the former blessed, it is rightly answered, because they adhere to [[god]]; and when it is [[asked]], why are the latter miserable, it is rightly answered, because they do not adhere to [[god]],—then there is no other [[good]] for the [[rational]] or intellectual creature save [[god]] only. thus, though it is not every creature that can be blessed (for beasts, trees, stones, and things of that [[kind]] have not this capacity), yet that creature which has the capacity cannot be blessed of itself, since it is created out of nothing, but only by him by whom it has been created. for it is blessed by the possession of that whose loss makes it miserable. he, then, who is blessed not in another, but in himself, cannot be miserable, because he cannot lose himself.

accordingly we say that there is no unchangeable [[good]] but the one, true, blessed [[god]]; that the things which he made are indeed [[good]] because from him, yet mutable because made not out of him, but out of nothing. although, therefore, they are not the supreme [[good]], for [[god]] is a greater [[good]], yet those mutable things which can adhere to the immutable [[good]], and so be blessed, are very [[good]]; for so completely is he their [[good]], that without him they cannot but be wretched. and the other created things in the [[universe]] are not [[better]] on this account, that they cannot be miserable. for no one would say that the other members of the [[body]] are superior to the [[eyes]], because they cannot be blind. but as the sentient [[nature]], even when it feels [[feel]] [[pain]], is superior to the stony, which can [[feel]] none, so the [[rational]] [[nature]], even when wretched, is more excellent than that which lacks [[reason]] or feeling, and can therefore [[experience]] no misery. and since this is so, then in this [[nature]] which has been created so excellent, that though it be mutable itself, it can yet secure its blessedness by adhering to the immutable [[good]], the supreme [[god]]; and since it is not satisfied unless it be perfectly blessed, and cannot be thus blessed save in [[god]],—in this [[nature]], i say, not to adhere to [[god]], is manifestly a [[fault]].[520] now every [[fault]] injures the [[nature]], and is consequently contrary to the [[nature]]. the creature, therefore, which cleaves to [[god]], differs from[pg 483] those who do not, not by [[nature]], but by [[fault]]; and yet by this very [[fault]] the [[nature]] itself is proved to be very [[noble]] and admirable. for that [[nature]] is certainly praised, the [[fault]] of which is justly blamed. for we justly blame the [[fault]] because it [[mars]] the praiseworthy [[nature]]. as, then, when we say that blindness is a defect of the [[eyes]], we prove that sight belongs to the [[nature]] of the [[eyes]]; and when we say that deafness is a defect of the ears, hearing is thereby proved to belong to their [[nature]];—so, when we say that it is a [[fault]] of the angelic creature that it does not cleave to [[god]], we hereby most plainly declare that it pertained to its [[nature]] to cleave to [[god]]. and who can worthily conceive or express how [[great]] a [[glory]] that is, to cleave to [[god]], so as to [[live]] to him, to draw [[wisdom]] from him, to delight in him, and to enjoy this so [[great]] [[good]], without [[death]], error, or [[grief]]? and thus, since every [[vice]] is an injury of the [[nature]], that very [[vice]] of the wicked angels, their departure from [[god]], is sufficient proof that [[god]] created their [[nature]] so [[good]], that it is an injury to it not to be with [[god]].

2. that there is no entity[521] contrary to the [[divine]], because nonentity seems to be that which is wholly opposite to him who supremely and always is.

this may be enough to prevent any one from supposing, when we speak of the apostate angels, that they could have another [[nature]], derived, as it were, from some different origin, and not from [[god]]. from the [[great]] impiety of this error we shall disentangle ourselves the more readily and easily, the more distinctly we [[understand]] that which [[god]] spoke by the angel when he sent [[moses]] to the [[children]] of [[israel]]: "i am that i am."[522] for since [[god]] is the supreme existence, that is to say, supremely is, and is therefore unchangeable, the things that he made he empowered to be, but not to be supremely like himself. to some he communicated a more ample, to others a more limited existence, and thus arranged the natures [[nature]] of beings in ranks. for as from sapere comes sapientia, so from esse comes essentia,—a new word indeed, which the old latin writers did not use, but which is naturalized in our day,[523] that our [[language]] may not want an equivalent for the [[greek]] οὐσία. for this is expressed word for word by essentia.[pg 484] consequently, to that [[nature]] which supremely is, and which created all else that exists, no [[nature]] is contrary save that which does not [[exist]]. for nonentity is the contrary of that which is. and thus there is no being contrary to [[god]], the supreme being, and author of all beings whatsoever.

3. that the enemies [[enemy]] of [[god]] are so, not by [[nature]] but by will, which, as it injures them, injures a [[good]] [[nature]]; for if [[vice]] does not injure, it is not [[vice]].

in [[scripture]] they are called god's enemies [[enemy]] who oppose his [[rule]], not by [[nature]], but by [[vice]]; having no [[power]] to hurt him, but only themselves. for they are his enemies [[enemy]], not through their [[power]] to hurt, but by their will to oppose him. for [[god]] is unchangeable, and wholly proof against injury. therefore the [[vice]] which makes those who are called his enemies [[enemy]] resist him, is an [[evil]] not to [[god]], but to themselves. and to them it is an [[evil]], solely because it corrupts the [[good]] of their [[nature]]. it is not [[nature]], therefore, but [[vice]], which is contrary to [[god]]. for that which is [[evil]] is contrary to the [[good]]. and who will deny that [[god]] is the supreme [[good]]? [[vice]], therefore, is contrary to [[god]], as [[evil]] to [[good]]. further, the [[nature]] it vitiates is a [[good]], and therefore to this [[good]] also it is contrary. but while it is contrary to [[god]] only as [[evil]] to [[good]], it is contrary to the [[nature]] it vitiates, both as [[evil]] and as hurtful. for to [[god]] no evils [[evil]] are hurtful; but only to natures [[nature]] mutable and corruptible, though, by the testimony of the vices [[vice]] themselves, originally [[good]]. for were they not [[good]], vices [[vice]] could not hurt them. for how do they hurt them but by depriving them of integrity, [[beauty]], welfare, [[virtue]], and, in short, whatever [[natural]] [[good]] [[vice]] is wont to diminish or [[destroy]]? but if there be no [[good]] to take away, then no injury can be done, and consequently there can be no [[vice]]. for it is impossible that there should be a harmless [[vice]]. whence we gather, that though [[vice]] cannot injure the unchangeable [[good]], it can injure nothing but [[good]]; because it does not [[exist]] where it does not injure. this, then, may be thus formulated: [[vice]] cannot be in the highest [[good]], and cannot be but in some [[good]]. things solely [[good]], therefore, can in some circumstances [[exist]]; things solely [[evil]], never; for even those natures [[nature]] which are vitiated by an [[evil]] will, so far indeed as they are vitiated, are [[evil]], but in so far as they[pg 485] are natures [[nature]] they are [[good]]. and when a vitiated [[nature]] is punished, besides the [[good]] it has in being a [[nature]], it has this also, that it is not unpunished.[524] for this is just, and certainly everything just is a [[good]]. for no one is punished for [[natural]], but for voluntary vices [[vice]]. for even the [[vice]] which by the [[force]] of habit and long continuance has become a second [[nature]], had its origin in the will. for at [[present]] we are speaking of the vices [[vice]] of the [[nature]], which has a mental capacity for that enlightenment which discriminates between what is just and what is [[unjust]].

4. of the [[nature]] of irrational and lifeless creatures, which in their own [[kind]] and order do not mar the [[beauty]] of the [[universe]].

but it is ridiculous to condemn the faults [[fault]] of beasts and trees, and other such mortal and mutable things as are void of [[intelligence]], sensation, or [[life]], even though these faults [[fault]] should [[destroy]] their corruptible [[nature]]; for these creatures received, at their creator's will, an existence fitting them, by passing away and giving place to others, to secure that lowest form of [[beauty]], the [[beauty]] of seasons, which in its own place is a requisite part of this [[world]]. for things earthly were neither to be made [[equal]] to things heavenly, nor were they, though inferior, to be quite omitted from the [[universe]]. since, then, in those situations where such things are appropriate, some perish to make way for others that are born in their room, and the less succumb to the greater, and the things that are overcome are transformed into the quality of those that have the mastery, this is the appointed order of things transitory. of this order the [[beauty]] does not strike us, because by our mortal frailty we are so involved in a part of it, that we cannot perceive the whole, in which these fragments that offend us are harmonized with the most accurate fitness and [[beauty]]. and therefore, where we are not so well able to perceive the [[wisdom]] of the creator, we are very properly enjoined to [[believe]] it, lest in the vanity of [[human]] rashness we presume to find any [[fault]] with the [[work]] of so [[great]] an artificer. at the same [[time]], if we attentively consider even these faults [[fault]] of earthly[pg 486] things, which are neither voluntary nor penal, they seem to illustrate the excellence of the natures [[nature]] themselves, which are all originated and created by [[god]]; for it is that which pleases us in this [[nature]] which we are displeased to see removed by the [[fault]],—unless even the natures [[nature]] themselves displease [[men]], as often happens when they become hurtful to them, and then [[men]] estimate them not by their [[nature]], but by their utility; as in the case of those animals whose swarms scourged the [[pride]] of the [[egyptians]]. but in this way of estimating, they may find [[fault]] with the sun itself; for [[certain]] criminals [[criminal]] or debtors are sentenced by the judges [[judge]] to be set in the sun. therefore it is not with [[respect]] to our convenience or discomfort, but with [[respect]] to their own [[nature]], that the creatures are glorifying to their artificer. thus even the [[nature]] of the eternal [[fire]], penal though it be to the condemned sinners, is most assuredly worthy of [[praise]]. for what is more beautiful than [[fire]] flaming, blazing, and shining? what more useful than [[fire]] for warming, restoring, cooking, though nothing is more destructive than [[fire]] burning and consuming? the same thing, then, when applied in one way, is destructive, but when applied suitably, is most beneficial. for who can find words to tell its uses throughout the whole [[world]]? we must not listen, then, to those who [[praise]] the [[light]] of [[fire]] but find [[fault]] with its heat, judging it not by its [[nature]], but by their convenience or discomfort. for they [[wish]] to see, but not to be burnt. but they forget that this very [[light]] which is so pleasant to them, disagrees with and hurts [[weak]] [[eyes]]; and in that heat which is disagreeable to them, some animals find the most suitable conditions of a healthy [[life]].

5. that in all natures [[nature]], of every [[kind]] and rank, [[god]] is glorified.

all natures [[nature]], then, inasmuch as they are, and have therefore a rank and [[species]] of their own, and a [[kind]] of internal harmony, are certainly [[good]]. and when they are in the places assigned to them by the order of their [[nature]], they preserve such being as they have received. and those things which have not received everlasting being, are altered for [[better]] or for worse, so as to suit the wants and motions of those things to which the creator's [[law]] has made them subservient; and[pg 487] thus they tend in the [[divine]] providence to that end which is embraced in the general scheme of the [[government]] of the [[universe]]. so that, though the [[corruption]] of transitory and perishable things brings them to utter destruction, it does not prevent their producing that which was designed to be their result. and this being so, [[god]], who supremely is, and who therefore created every being which has not supreme existence (for that which was made of nothing could not be [[equal]] to him, and indeed could not be at all had he not made it), is not to be found [[fault]] with on account of the creature's faults [[fault]], but is to be praised in view of the natures [[nature]] he has made.

6. what the cause of the blessedness of the [[good]] angels is, and what the cause of the misery of the wicked.

thus the true cause of the blessedness of the [[good]] angels is found to be this, that they cleave to him who supremely is. and if we ask the cause of the misery of the [[bad]], it occurs to us, and not unreasonably, that they are miserable because they have forsaken him who supremely is, and have turned to themselves who have no such essence. and this [[vice]], what else is it called than [[pride]]? for "pride is the beginning of [[sin]]."[525] they were unwilling, then, to preserve their [[strength]] for [[god]]; and as adherence to [[god]] was the condition of their enjoying an ampler being, they diminished it by preferring themselves to him. this was the first defect, and the first impoverishment, and the first flaw of their [[nature]], which was created, not indeed supremely existent, but finding its blessedness in the enjoyment of the supreme being; whilst by abandoning him it should become, not indeed no [[nature]] at all, but a [[nature]] with a less ample existence, and therefore wretched.

if the further [[question]] be [[asked]], what was the efficient cause of their [[evil]] will? there is none. for what is it which makes the will [[bad]], when it is the will itself which makes the action [[bad]]? and consequently the [[bad]] will is the cause of the [[bad]] action, but nothing is the efficient cause of the [[bad]] will. for if anything is the cause, this thing either has or has not a will. if it has, the will is either [[good]] or [[bad]]. if [[good]], who is so left to himself as to say that a [[good]] will[pg 488] makes a will [[bad]]? for in this case a [[good]] will would be the cause of [[sin]]; a most absurd supposition. on the other hand, if this hypothetical thing has a [[bad]] will, i [[wish]] to [[know]] what made it so; and that we may not go on for ever, i ask at once, what made the first [[evil]] will [[bad]]? for that is not the first which was itself corrupted by an [[evil]] will, but that is the first which was made [[evil]] by no other will. for if it were preceded by that which made it [[evil]], that will was first which made the other [[evil]]. but if it is replied, "nothing made it [[evil]]; it always was [[evil]]," i ask if it has been existing in some [[nature]]. for if not, then it did not [[exist]] at all; and if it did [[exist]] in some [[nature]], then it vitiated and corrupted it, and injured it, and consequently deprived it of [[good]]. and therefore the [[evil]] will could not [[exist]] in an [[evil]] [[nature]], but in a [[nature]] at once [[good]] and mutable, which this [[vice]] could injure. for if it did no injury, it was no [[vice]]; and consequently the will in which it was, could not be called [[evil]]. but if it did injury, it did it by taking away or diminishing [[good]]. and therefore there could not be from eternity, as was suggested, an [[evil]] will in that thing in which there had been previously a [[natural]] [[good]], which the [[evil]] will was able to diminish by corrupting it. if, then, it was not from eternity, who, i ask, made it? the only thing that can be suggested in reply is, that something which itself had no will, made the will [[evil]]. i ask, then, whether this thing was superior, inferior, or [[equal]] to it? if superior, then it is [[better]]. how, then, has it no will, and not rather a [[good]] will? the same reasoning applies if it was [[equal]]; for so long as two things have equally a [[good]] will, the one cannot [[produce]] in the other an [[evil]] will. then remains the supposition that that which corrupted the will of the angelic [[nature]] which first sinned, was itself an inferior thing without a will. but that thing, be it of the lowest and most earthly [[kind]], is certainly itself [[good]], since it is a [[nature]] and being, with a form and rank of its own in its own [[kind]] and order. how, then, can a [[good]] thing be the efficient cause of an [[evil]] will? how, i say, can [[good]] be the cause of [[evil]]? for when the will abandons what is above itself, and turns to what is lower, it becomes evil—not because that is [[evil]] to which it turns, but because the[pg 489] turning itself is wicked. therefore it is not an inferior thing which has made the will [[evil]], but it is itself which has become so by wickedly and inordinately desiring an inferior thing. for if two [[men]], alike in physical and [[moral]] [[constitution]], see the same corporal [[beauty]], and one of them is excited by the sight to [[desire]] an illicit enjoyment, while the other stedfastly maintains a modest restraint of his will, what do we suppose brings it about, that there is an [[evil]] will in the one and not in the other? what produces [[produce]] it in the [[man]] in whom it exists? not the bodily [[beauty]], for that was presented equally to the gaze of both, and yet did not [[produce]] in both an [[evil]] will. did the flesh of the one cause the [[desire]] as he looked? but why did not the flesh of the other? or was it the disposition? but why not the disposition of both? for we are supposing that both were of a like temperament of [[body]] and [[soul]]. must we, then, say that the one was tempted by a secret suggestion of the [[evil]] spirit? as if it was not by his own will that he consented to this suggestion and to any inducement whatever! this [[consent]], then, this [[evil]] will which he presented to the [[evil]] suasive influence,—what was the cause of it, we ask? for, not to delay on such a difficulty as this, if both are tempted equally, and one yields and consents to the temptation, while the other remains unmoved by it, what other account can we give of the matter than this, that the one is willing, the other unwilling, to fall away from chastity? and what causes this but their own wills, in cases at least such as we are supposing, where the temperament is identical? the same [[beauty]] was equally obvious to the [[eyes]] of both; the same secret temptation pressed on both with [[equal]] [[violence]]. however minutely we examine the case, therefore, we can discern nothing which caused the will of the one to be [[evil]]. for if we say that the [[man]] himself made his will [[evil]], what was the [[man]] himself before his will was [[evil]] but a [[good]] [[nature]] created by [[god]], the unchangeable [[good]]? here are two [[men]] who, before the temptation, were alike in [[body]] and [[soul]], and of whom one yielded to the tempter who persuaded him, while the other could not be persuaded to [[desire]] that lovely [[body]] which was equally before the [[eyes]] of both. shall we say of the successfully tempted [[man]] that he[pg 490] corrupted his own will, since he was certainly [[good]] before his will became [[bad]]? then, why did he do so? was it because his will was a [[nature]], or because it was made of nothing? we shall find that the latter is the case. for if a [[nature]] is the cause of an [[evil]] will, what else can we say than that [[evil]] arises from [[good]], or that [[good]] is the cause of [[evil]]? and how can it come to pass that a [[nature]], [[good]] though mutable, should [[produce]] any evil—that is to say, should make the will itself wicked?

7. that we ought not to expect to find any efficient cause of the [[evil]] will.

let no one, therefore, look for an efficient cause of the [[evil]] will; for it is not efficient, but deficient, as the will itself is not an effecting of something, but a defect. for defection from that which supremely is, to that which has less of being,—this is to begin to have an [[evil]] will. now, to seek to discover the causes of these defections,—causes, as i have said, not efficient, but deficient,—is as if some one sought to see darkness, or hear [[silence]]. yet both of these are known by us, and the former by means only of the eye, the latter only by the ear; but not by their positive actuality,[526] but by their want of it. let no one, then, seek to [[know]] from me what i [[know]] that i do not [[know]]; unless he perhaps wishes [[wish]] to learn to be ignorant of that of which all we [[know]] is, that it cannot be known. for those things which are known not by their actuality, but by their want of it, are known, if our expression may be allowed and understood, by not knowing them, that by knowing them they may be not known. for when the eyesight surveys objects that strike the sense, it nowhere sees darkness but where it begins not to see. and so no other sense but the ear can perceive [[silence]], and yet it is only perceived by not hearing. thus, too, our [[mind]] perceives intelligible forms by understanding them; but when they are deficient, it knows [[know]] them by not knowing them; for "who can [[understand]] defects?"[527]

8. of the misdirected [[love]] whereby the will fell away from the immutable to the mutable [[good]].

this i do [[know]], that the [[nature]] of [[god]] can never, nowhere,[pg 491] nowise be defective, and that natures [[nature]] made of nothing can. these latter, however, the more being they have, and the more [[good]] they do (for then they do something positive), the more they have efficient causes; but in so far as they are defective in being, and consequently do [[evil]] (for then what is their [[work]] but vanity?), they have deficient causes. and i [[know]] likewise, that the will could not become [[evil]], were it unwilling to become so; and therefore its failings are justly punished, being not necessary, but voluntary. for its defections are not to [[evil]] things, but are themselves [[evil]]; that is to say, are not towards things that are naturally and in themselves [[evil]], but the defection of the will is [[evil]], because it is contrary to the order of [[nature]], and an abandonment of that which has supreme being for that which has less. for avarice is not a [[fault]] inherent in gold, but in the [[man]] who inordinately loves [[love]] gold, to the detriment of [[justice]], which ought to be held in incomparably higher regard than gold. neither is luxury the [[fault]] of lovely and charming objects, but of the [[heart]] that inordinately loves [[love]] sensual pleasures [[pleasure]], to the neglect of temperance, which attaches us to objects more lovely in their spirituality, and more delectable by their incorruptibility. nor yet is boasting the [[fault]] of [[human]] [[praise]], but of the [[soul]] that is inordinately fond of the applause of [[men]], and that makes [[light]] of the voice of [[conscience]]. [[pride]], too, is not the [[fault]] of him who delegates [[power]], nor of [[power]] itself, but of the [[soul]] that is inordinately enamoured of its own [[power]], and despises the more just dominion of a higher [[authority]]. consequently he who inordinately loves [[love]] the [[good]] which any [[nature]] possesses, even though he obtain it, himself becomes [[evil]] in the [[good]], and wretched because deprived of a greater [[good]].

9. whether the angels, besides receiving from [[god]] their [[nature]], received from him also their [[good]] will by the holy spirit imbuing them with [[love]].

there is, then, no [[natural]] efficient cause, or, if i may be allowed the expression, no essential cause, of the [[evil]] will, since itself is the origin of [[evil]] in mutable spirits, by which the [[good]] of their [[nature]] is diminished and corrupted; and the will is made [[evil]] by nothing else than defection from [[god]],—a defection of which the cause, too, is certainly deficient.[pg 492] but as to the [[good]] will, if we should say that there is no efficient cause of it, we must beware of giving currency to the [[opinion]] that the [[good]] will of the [[good]] angels is not created, but is co-eternal with [[god]]. for if they themselves are created, how can we say that their [[good]] will was eternal? but if created, was it created along with themselves, or did they [[exist]] for a [[time]] without it? if along with themselves, then doubtless it was created by him who created them, and, as soon as ever they were created, they attached themselves to him who created them, with the [[love]] he created in them. and they are separated from the [[society]] of the rest, because they have continued in the same [[good]] will; while the others have fallen away to another will, which is an [[evil]] one, by the very [[fact]] of its being a falling away from the [[good]]; from which, we may add, they would not have fallen away had they been unwilling to do so. but if the [[good]] angels existed for a [[time]] without a [[good]] will, and produced it in themselves without god's interference, then it follows that they made themselves [[better]] than he made them. away with such a thought! for without a [[good]] will, what were they but [[evil]]? or if they were not [[evil]], because they had not an [[evil]] will any more than a [[good]] one (for they had not fallen away from that which as yet they had not begun to enjoy), certainly they were not the same, not so [[good]], as when they came to have a [[good]] will. or if they could not make themselves [[better]] than they were made by him who is surpassed by none in his [[work]], then certainly, without his helpful operation, they could not come to possess that [[good]] will which made them [[better]]. and though their [[good]] will effected that they did not turn to themselves, who had a more stinted existence, but to him who supremely is, and that, being [[united]] to him, their own being was enlarged, and they lived a [[wise]] and blessed [[life]] by his communications to them, what does this prove but that the will, however [[good]] it might be, would have continued helplessly only to [[desire]] him, had not he who had made their [[nature]] out of nothing, and yet capable of enjoying him, first stimulated it to [[desire]] him, and then filled it with himself, and so made it [[better]]?

besides, this too has to be inquired into, whether, if the[pg 493] [[good]] angels made their own will [[good]], they did so with or without will? if without, then it was not their doing. if with, was the will [[good]] or [[bad]]? if [[bad]], how could a [[bad]] will give birth to a [[good]] one? if [[good]], then already they had a [[good]] will. and who made this will, which already they had, but he who created them with a [[good]] will, or with that chaste [[love]] by which they cleaved to him, in one and the same act creating their [[nature]], and endowing it with grace? and thus we are driven to [[believe]] that the holy angels never existed without a [[good]] will or the [[love]] of [[god]]. but the angels who, though created [[good]], are yet [[evil]] now, became so by their own will. and this will was not made [[evil]] by their [[good]] [[nature]], unless by its voluntary defection from [[good]]; for [[good]] is not the cause of [[evil]], but a defection from [[good]] is. these angels, therefore, either received less of the grace of the [[divine]] [[love]] than those who persevered in the same; or if both were created equally [[good]], then, while the one fell by their [[evil]] will, the others were more abundantly assisted, and attained to that pitch of blessedness at which they became [[certain]] they should never fall from it,—as we have already shown in the preceding [[book]].[528] we must therefore acknowledge, with the [[praise]] due to the creator, that not only of holy [[men]], but also of the holy angels, it can be said that "the [[love]] of [[god]] is shed abroad in their hearts [[heart]] by the holy ghost, which is given unto them."[529] and that not only of [[men]], but primarily and principally of angels it is true, as it is written, "it is [[good]] to draw near to [[god]]."[530] and those who have this [[good]] in [[common]], have, both with him to whom they draw near, and with one another, a holy fellowship, and form one [[city]] of god—his living [[sacrifice]], and his living temple. and i see that, as i have now spoken of the rise of this [[city]] among the angels, it is [[time]] to speak of the origin of that part of it which is hereafter to be [[united]] to the [[immortal]] angels, and which at [[present]] is being gathered from among mortal [[men]], and is either sojourning on [[earth]], or, in the persons [[person]] of those who have passed through [[death]], is resting in the secret receptacles and abodes of disembodied spirits. for from one [[man]], whom [[god]] created as the first, the whole[pg 494] [[human]] [[race]] descended, according to the [[faith]] of holy [[scripture]], which deservedly is of wonderful [[authority]] among all nations throughout the [[world]]; since, among its other true statements, it predicted, by its [[divine]] foresight, that all nations would give credit to it.

10. of the falseness of the [[history]] which allots many thousand years to the world's [[past]].

let us, then, omit the conjectures of [[men]] who [[know]] not what they say, when they speak of the [[nature]] and origin of the [[human]] [[race]]. for some hold the same [[opinion]] regarding [[men]] that they hold regarding the [[world]] itself, that they have always been. thus apuleius says when he is describing our [[race]], "individually they are mortal, but collectively, and as a [[race]], they are [[immortal]]."[531] and when they are [[asked]], how, if the [[human]] [[race]] has always been, they vindicate the [[truth]] of their [[history]], which narrates who were the inventors, and what they [[invented]], and who first instituted the liberal studies and the other [[arts]], and who first inhabited this or that region, and this or that island? they reply[532] that most, if not all lands [[land]], were so desolated at intervals by [[fire]] and flood, that [[men]] were greatly reduced in numbers, and from these, again, the [[population]] was restored to its former numbers, and that thus there was at intervals a new beginning made, and though those things which had been interrupted and checked by the severe devastations were only renewed, yet they seemed to be originated then, but that [[man]] could not [[exist]] at all save as produced by [[man]]. but they say what they [[think]], not what they [[know]].

they are deceived, too, by those highly mendacious documents which profess to give the [[history]] of many thousand years, though, reckoning by the [[sacred]] writings, we find that not 6000 years have yet passed.[533] and, not to spend many words in exposing the baselessness of these documents, in[pg 495] which so many thousands of years are accounted for, nor in proving that their authorities [[authority]] are totally inadequate, let me cite only that letter which alexander the [[great]] wrote to his [[mother]] olympias,[534] giving her the narrative he had from an egyptian [[priest]], which he had extracted from their [[sacred]] archives, and which gave an account of kingdoms [[kingdom]] mentioned also by the [[greek]] historians. in this letter of alexander's a term of upwards of 5000 years is assigned to the [[kingdom]] of assyria; while in the [[greek]] [[history]] only 1300 years are reckoned from the reign of bel himself, whom both [[greek]] and egyptian agree in counting the first [[king]] of assyria. then to the [[empire]] of the persians and macedonians this egyptian assigned more than 8000 years, counting to the [[time]] of alexander, to whom he was speaking; while among the greeks [[greek]], 485 years are assigned to the macedonians down to the [[death]] of alexander, and to the persians 233 years, reckoning to the termination of his conquests. thus these give a much smaller number of years than the [[egyptians]]; and indeed, though multiplied three times [[time]], the [[greek]] chronology would still be shorter. for the [[egyptians]] are said to have formerly reckoned only four months to their year;[535] so that one year, according to the fuller and truer computation now in use among them as well as among ourselves, would comprehend three of their old years. but not even thus, as i said, does the [[greek]] [[history]] correspond with the egyptian in its chronology. and therefore the former must receive the greater credit, because it does not exceed the true account of the duration of the [[world]] as it is given by our documents, which are truly [[sacred]]. further, if this letter of alexander, which has become so famous, differs widely in this matter of chronology from the probable credible account, how much less can we [[believe]] these documents which, though full of fabulous and fictitious antiquities, they would fain oppose to the [[authority]] of our well-known and [[divine]] books [[book]], which predicted[pg 496] that the whole [[world]] would [[believe]] them, and which the whole [[world]] accordingly has believed; which proved, too, that it had truly narrated [[past]] events by its prediction of future events, which have so exactly come to pass!

11. of those who suppose that this [[world]] indeed is not eternal, but that either there are numberless worlds [[world]], or that one and the same [[world]] is perpetually resolved into its elements, and renewed at the conclusion of fixed cycles.

there are some, again, who, though they do not suppose that this [[world]] is eternal, are of [[opinion]] either that this is not the only [[world]], but that there are numberless worlds [[world]], or that indeed it is the only one, but that it dies, and is born again at fixed intervals, and this times [[time]] without number;[536] but they must acknowledge that the [[human]] [[race]] existed before there were other [[men]] to beget them. for they cannot suppose that, if the whole [[world]] perish, some [[men]] would be left alive in the [[world]], as they might survive in floods and conflagrations, which those other speculators suppose to be partial, and from which they can therefore reasonably argue that a few [[men]] survived whose [[posterity]] would renew the [[population]]; but as they [[believe]] that the [[world]] itself is renewed out of its own material, so they must [[believe]] that out of its elements the [[human]] [[race]] was produced, and then that the progeny of mortals sprang like that of other animals from their parents.

12. how these persons [[person]] are to be answered, who find [[fault]] with the creation of [[man]] on the score of its recent date.

as to those who are always asking why [[man]] was not created during these countless ages [[age]] of the infinitely extended [[past]], and came into being so lately that, according to [[scripture]], less than 6000 years have elapsed since he began to be, i would reply to them regarding the creation of [[man]], just as i replied regarding the origin of the [[world]] to those who will not [[believe]] that it is not eternal, but had a beginning, which even [[plato]] himself most plainly declares, though some [[think]] his statement was not consistent with his real [[opinion]].[537] if it[pg 497] offends them that the [[time]] that has elapsed since the creation of [[man]] is so short, and his years so few according to our authorities [[authority]], let them take this into consideration, that nothing that has a limit is long, and that all the ages [[age]] of [[time]] being finite, are very little, or indeed nothing at all, when compared to the interminable eternity. consequently, if there had elapsed since the creation of [[man]], i do not say five or six, but even sixty or six hundred thousand years, or sixty times [[time]] as many, or six hundred or six hundred thousand times [[time]] as many, or this sum multiplied until it could no longer be expressed in numbers, the same [[question]] could still be put, why was he not made before? for the [[past]] and boundless eternity during which [[god]] abstained from creating [[man]] is so [[great]], that, compare it with what vast and untold number of ages [[age]] you please, so long as there is a definite conclusion of this term of [[time]], it is not even as if you compared the minutest drop of water with the ocean that everywhere flows around the globe. for of these two, one indeed is very small, the other incomparably vast, yet both are finite; but that space of [[time]] which starts from some beginning, and is limited by some termination, be it of what extent it may, if you compare it with that which has no beginning, i [[know]] not whether to say we should count it the very minutest thing, or nothing at all. for, take this limited [[time]], and deduct from the end of it, one by one, the briefest moments (as you might take day by day from a man's [[man]] [[life]], beginning at the day in which he now lives [[life]], back to that of his birth), and though the number of moments you must subtract in this backward movement be so [[great]] that no word can express it, yet this subtraction will some [[time]] carry you to the beginning. but if you take away from a [[time]] which has no beginning, i do not say brief moments one by one, nor yet hours, or days, or months, or years even in quantities, but terms of years so vast that they cannot be named by the most skilful arithmetician,—take away terms of years as vast as that which we have supposed to be gradually consumed by the deduction of moments,—and take them away not once and again repeatedly, but always, and what do you effect, what do you make by your deduction, since you never reach the beginning which has no existence? wherefore, that[pg 498] which we now demand after five thousand odd years, our descendants might with like curiosity demand after six hundred thousand years, supposing these dying generations [[generation]] of [[men]] continue so long to decay and be renewed, and supposing [[posterity]] continues as [[weak]] and ignorant as ourselves. the same [[question]] might have been [[asked]] by those who have lived before us, and while [[man]] was even newer upon [[earth]]. the first [[man]] himself, in short, might, the day after, or the very day of his creation, have [[asked]] why he was created no sooner. and no matter at what earlier or later period he had been created, this controversy about the commencement of this world's [[history]] would have had precisely the same difficulties as it has now.

13. of the [[revolution]] of the ages [[age]], which some [[philosophers]] [[believe]] will bring all things round again, after a [[certain]] fixed cycle, to the same order and form as at first.

this controversy some [[philosophers]] have seen no other approved means of solving than by introducing cycles of [[time]], in which there should be a constant renewal and repetition of the order of [[nature]];[538] and they have therefore asserted that these cycles will ceaselessly recur, one passing away and another coming, though they are not agreed as to whether one permanent [[world]] shall pass through all these cycles, or whether the [[world]] shall at fixed intervals [[die]] out, and be renewed so as to exhibit a recurrence of the same phenomena—the things which have been, and those which are to be, coinciding. and from this fantastic vicissitude they exempt not even the [[immortal]] [[soul]] that has attained [[wisdom]], consigning it to a ceaseless transmigration between delusive blessedness and real misery. for how can that be truly called blessed which has no assurance of being so eternally, and is either in ignorance of the [[truth]], and blind to the misery that is approaching, or, knowing it, is in misery and [[fear]]? or if it passes to bliss, and leaves miseries for ever, then there happens in [[time]] a new thing which [[time]] shall not end. why not, then, the [[world]] also? why may not [[man]], too, be a similar thing? so that, by following the straight path of sound doctrine, we[pg 499] escape, i [[know]] not what circuitous paths, discovered by deceiving and deceived sages.

some, too, in advocating these recurring cycles that restore all things to their original, cite in favour of their supposition what solomon says in the [[book]] of ecclesiastes: "what is that which hath been? it is that which shall be. and what is that which is done? it is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. who can speak and say, see, this is new? it hath been already of old [[time]], which was before us."[539] this he said either of those things of which he had just been speaking—the succession of generations [[generation]], the orbit of the sun, the course of rivers,—or else of all kinds [[kind]] of creatures that are born and [[die]]. for [[men]] were before us, are with us, and shall be after us; and so all living things and all plants. even monstrous and irregular productions, though differing from one another, and though some are reported as solitary instances, yet resemble one another generally, in so far as they are miraculous and monstrous, and, in this sense, have been, and shall be, and are no new and recent things under the sun. however, some would [[understand]] these words as meaning that in the predestination of [[god]] all things have already existed, and that thus there is no new thing under the sun. at all events, far be it from any true believer to suppose that by these words of solomon those cycles are meant, in which, according to those [[philosophers]], the same periods and events of [[time]] are repeated; as if, for [[example]], the philosopher [[plato]], having taught in the school at [[athens]] which is called the academy, so, numberless ages [[age]] before, at long but [[certain]] intervals, this same [[plato]], and the same school, and the same disciples existed, and so also are to be repeated during the countless cycles that are yet be be,—far be it, i say, from us to [[believe]] this. for once [[christ]] died for our sins [[sin]]; and, rising from the [[dead]], he dieth no more. "death hath no more dominion over him;"[540] and we ourselves after the resurrection shall be "ever with the [[lord]],"[541] to whom we now say, as the [[sacred]] psalmist dictates, "thou shalt keep us, o [[lord]], thou shalt preserve us from this [[generation]]."[pg 500][542] and that too which follows, is, i [[think]], appropriate enough: "the wicked walk in a circle;" not because their [[life]] is to recur by means of these circles, which these [[philosophers]] imagine, but because the path in which their false doctrine now runs is circuitous.

14. of the creation of the [[human]] [[race]] in [[time]], and how this was effected without any new design or [[change]] of [[purpose]] on god's part.

what wonder is it if, entangled in these circles, they find neither entrance nor egress? for they [[know]] not how the [[human]] [[race]], and this mortal condition of ours, took its origin, nor how it will be brought to an end, since they cannot penetrate the inscrutable [[wisdom]] of [[god]]. for, though himself eternal, and without beginning, yet he caused [[time]] to have a beginning; and [[man]], whom he had not previously made, he made in [[time]], not from a new and sudden resolution, but by his unchangeable and eternal design. who can search out the unsearchable depth of this [[purpose]], who can scrutinize the inscrutable [[wisdom]], wherewith [[god]], without [[change]] of will, created [[man]], who had never before been, and gave him an existence in [[time]], and increased the [[human]] [[race]] from one [[individual]]? for the psalmist himself, when he had first said, "thou shalt keep us, o [[lord]], thou shalt preserve us from this [[generation]] for ever," and had then rebuked those whose foolish and impious doctrine preserves for the [[soul]] no eternal deliverance and blessedness, adds immediately, "the wicked walk in a circle." then, as if it were said to him, "what then do you [[believe]], [[feel]], [[know]]? are we to [[believe]] that it suddenly occurred to [[god]] to create [[man]], whom he had never before made in a [[past]] eternity,—god, to whom nothing new can occur, and in whom is no changeableness?" the psalmist goes on to reply, as if addressing [[god]] himself, "according to the depth of thy [[wisdom]] thou hast multiplied the [[children]] of [[men]]." let [[men]], he seems to say, fancy what they please, let them conjecture and dispute as seems [[good]] to them, but thou hast multiplied the [[children]] of [[men]] according to the depth of thy [[wisdom]], which no [[man]] can comprehend. for this is a depth indeed, that [[god]] always has been, and that [[man]], whom he had never made before, he willed to make in [[time]], and this without changing his design and will.

[pg 501]

15. whether we are to [[believe]] that [[god]], as he has always been [[sovereign]] [[lord]], has always had creatures over whom he exercised his sovereignty; and in what sense we can say that the creature has always been, and yet cannot say it is co-eternal.

for my own part, indeed, as i dare not say that there ever was a [[time]] when the [[lord]] [[god]] was not [[lord]],[543] so i ought not to [[doubt]] that [[man]] had no existence before [[time]], and was first created in [[time]]. but when i consider what [[god]] could be the [[lord]] of, if there was not always some creature, i shrink from making any assertion, remembering my own insignificance, and that it is written, "what [[man]] is he that can [[know]] the counsel of [[god]]? or who can [[think]] what the will of the [[lord]] is? for the thoughts [[thought]] of mortal [[men]] are timid, and our devices are but uncertain. for the corruptible [[body]] presseth down the [[soul]], and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the [[mind]] that museth upon many things."[544] many things certainly do i muse upon in this earthly tabernacle, because the one thing which is true among the many, or beyond the many, i cannot find. if, then, among these many thoughts [[thought]], i say that there have always been creatures for him to be [[lord]] of, who is always and ever has been [[lord]], but that these creatures have not always been the same, but succeeded one another (for we would not seem to say that any is co-eternal with the creator, an assertion condemned equally by [[faith]] and sound reason), i must take [[care]] lest i fall into the absurd and ignorant error of maintaining that by these successions and changes [[change]] mortal creatures have always existed, whereas the [[immortal]] creatures had not begun to [[exist]] until the date of our own [[world]], when the angels were created; if at least the angels are intended by that [[light]] which was first made, or, rather, by that [[heaven]] of which it is said, "in the beginning [[god]] created the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]."[545] the angels at least did not [[exist]] before they were created; for if we say that they have always existed, we shall seem to make them co-eternal with the creator. again, if i say that the angels were not created in [[time]], but existed before all times [[time]], as those over whom [[god]], who has ever been [[sovereign]], exercised his sovereignty, then i shall be [[asked]] whether, if they were created before all [[time]],[pg 502] they, being creatures, could possibly always [[exist]]. it may perhaps be replied, why not always, since that which is in all [[time]] may very properly be said to be "always?" now, so true is it that these angels have existed in all [[time]], that even before [[time]] was, they were created; if at least [[time]] began with the heavens [[heaven]], and the angels existed before the heavens [[heaven]]. and if [[time]] was even before the heavenly bodies [[body]], not indeed marked by hours, days, months, and years,—for these measures of time's periods which are commonly and properly called times [[time]], did manifestly begin with the motion of the heavenly bodies [[body]], and so [[god]] said, when he appointed them, "let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years,"[546]—if, i say, [[time]] was before these heavenly bodies [[body]] by some changing movement, whose parts succeeded one another and could not [[exist]] simultaneously, and if there was some such movement among the angels which necessitated the existence of [[time]], and that they from their very creation should be [[subject]] to these temporal changes [[change]], then they have existed in all [[time]], for [[time]] came into being along with them. and who will say that what was in all [[time]], was not always?

but if i make such a reply, it will be said to me, how, then, are they not co-eternal with the creator, if he and they always have been? how even can they be said to have been created, if we are to [[understand]] that they have always existed? what shall we reply to this? shall we say that both statements are true? that they always have been, since they have been in all [[time]], they being created along with [[time]], or [[time]] along with them, and yet that also they were created? for, similarly, we will not deny that [[time]] itself was created, though no one doubts [[doubt]] that [[time]] has been in all [[time]]; for if it has not been in all [[time]], then there was a [[time]] when there was no [[time]]. but the most foolish [[person]] could not make such an assertion. for we can reasonably say there was a [[time]] when [[rome]] was not; there was a [[time]] when [[jerusalem]] was not; there was a [[time]] when [[abraham]] was not; there was a [[time]] when [[man]] was not, and so on: in fine, if the [[world]] was not made at the commencement of [[time]], but after some [[time]] had elapsed, we can say there[pg 503] was a [[time]] when the [[world]] was not. but to say there was a [[time]] when [[time]] was not, is as absurd as to say there was a [[man]] when there was no [[man]]; or, this [[world]] was when this [[world]] was not. for if we are not referring to the same object, the form of expression may be used, as, there was another [[man]] when this [[man]] was not. thus we can reasonably say there was another [[time]] when this [[time]] was not; but not the merest simpleton could say there was a [[time]] when there was no [[time]]. as, then, we say that [[time]] was created, though we also say that it always has been, since in all [[time]] time has been, so it does not [[follow]] that if the angels have always been, they were therefore not created. for we say that they have always been, because they have been in all [[time]]; and we say they have been in all [[time]], because [[time]] itself could no [[wise]] be without them. for where there is no creature whose changing movements admit of succession, there cannot be [[time]] at all. and consequently, even if they have always existed, they were created; neither, if they have always existed, are they therefore co-eternal with the creator. for he has always existed in unchangeable eternity; while they were created, and are said to have been always, because they have been in all [[time]], [[time]] being impossible without the creature. but [[time]] passing away by its changefulness, cannot be co-eternal with changeless eternity. and consequently, though the immortality of the angels does not pass in [[time]], does not become [[past]] as if now it were not, nor has a future as if it were not yet, still their movements, which are the basis of [[time]], do pass from future to [[past]]; and therefore they cannot be co-eternal with the creator, in whose movement we cannot say that there has been that which now is not, or shall be that which is not yet. wherefore, if [[god]] always has been [[lord]], he has always had creatures under his dominion,—creatures, however, not begotten of him, but created by him out of nothing; nor co-eternal with him, for he was before them, though at no [[time]] without them, because he preceded them, not by the lapse of [[time]], but by his abiding eternity. but if i make this reply to those who demand how he was always creator, always [[lord]], if there were not always a [[subject]] creation; or how this was created, and not[pg 504] rather co-eternal with its creator, if it always was, i [[fear]] i may be accused of recklessly affirming what i [[know]] not, instead of teaching what i [[know]]. i return, therefore, to that which our creator has seen fit that we should [[know]]; and those things which he has allowed the abler [[men]] to [[know]] in this [[life]], or has reserved to be known in the next by the perfected saints, i acknowledge to be beyond my capacity. but i have [[thought]] it [[right]] to discuss these matters without making positive assertions, that they who [[read]] may be warned to abstain from hazardous questions [[question]], and may not deem themselves fit for everything. let them rather endeavour to obey the wholesome injunction of the apostle, when he says, "for i say, through the grace given unto me, to every [[man]] that is among you, not to [[think]] of himself more highly than he ought to [[think]]; but to [[think]] soberly, according as [[god]] hath dealt to every [[man]] the measure of [[faith]]."[547] for if an infant receive nourishment suited to its [[strength]], it becomes capable, as it grows, of taking more; but if its [[strength]] and capacity be overtaxed, it dwines away in place of growing.

16. how we are to [[understand]] god's promise of [[life]] eternal, which was uttered before the "eternal times [[time]]."

i own that i do not [[know]] what ages [[age]] passed before the [[human]] [[race]] was created, yet i have no [[doubt]] that no created thing is co-eternal with the creator. but even the apostle speaks of [[time]] as eternal, and this with reference, not to the future, but, which is more surprising, to the [[past]]. for he says, "in [[hope]] of eternal [[life]], which [[god]] that cannot [[lie]] promised before the eternal times [[time]], but hath in due times [[time]] manifested his word."[548] you see he says that in the [[past]] there have been eternal times [[time]], which, however, were not co-eternal with [[god]]. and since [[god]] before these eternal times [[time]] not only existed, but also "promised" [[life]] eternal, which he manifested in its own times [[time]] (that is to say, in due times), what else is this than his word? for this is [[life]] eternal. but then, how did he promise; for the promise was made to [[men]], and yet they had no existence before eternal times [[time]]?[pg 505] does this not mean that, in his own eternity, and in his co-eternal word, that which was to be in its own [[time]] was already predestined and fixed?

17. what defence is made by sound [[faith]] regarding god's unchangeable counsel and will, against the reasonings of those who hold that the works [[work]] of [[god]] are eternally repeated in revolving cycles that restore all things as they were.

of this, too, i have no [[doubt]], that before the first [[man]] was created, there never had been a [[man]] at all, neither this same [[man]] himself recurring by i [[know]] not what cycles, and having made i [[know]] not how many revolutions [[revolution]], nor any other of similar [[nature]]. from this [[belief]] i am not frightened by philosophical arguments, among which that is reckoned the most acute which is founded on the assertion that the infinite cannot be comprehended by any mode of [[knowledge]]. consequently, they argue, [[god]] has in his own [[mind]] finite conceptions of all finite things which he makes. now it cannot be supposed that his goodness was ever idle; for if it were, there should be ascribed to him an awakening to activity in [[time]], from a [[past]] eternity of inactivity, as if he repented of an idleness that had no beginning, and proceeded, therefore, to make a beginning of [[work]]. this being the case, they say it must be that the same things are always repeated, and that as they pass, so they are destined always to return, whether amidst all these changes [[change]] the [[world]] remains the same,—the [[world]] which has always been, and yet was created,—or that the [[world]] in these revolutions [[revolution]] is perpetually dying out and being renewed; otherwise, if we point to a [[time]] when the works [[work]] of [[god]] were begun, it would be believed that he considered his [[past]] eternal leisure to be inert and indolent, and therefore condemned and altered it as displeasing to himself. now if [[god]] is supposed to have been indeed always making temporal things, but different from one another, and one after the other, so that he thus came at [[last]] to make [[man]], whom he had never made before, then it may seem that he made [[man]] not with [[knowledge]] (for they suppose no [[knowledge]] can comprehend the infinite succession of creatures), but at the dictate of the hour, as it struck him at the moment, with a sudden and accidental [[change]] of [[mind]]. on the other hand, say they, if those cycles be admitted, and if we suppose that[pg 506] the same temporal things are repeated, while the [[world]] either remains identical through all these rotations, or else dies away and is renewed, then there is ascribed to [[god]] neither the slothful ease of a [[past]] eternity, nor a rash and unforeseen creation. and if the same things be not thus repeated in cycles, then they cannot by any [[science]] or prescience be comprehended in their endless [[diversity]]. even though [[reason]] could not refute, [[faith]] would smile at these argumentations, with which the godless endeavour to turn our simple piety from the [[right]] way, that we may walk with them "in a circle." but by the [[help]] of the [[lord]] our [[god]], even [[reason]], and that readily enough, shatters these revolving circles which conjecture frames. for that which specially leads these [[men]] astray to prefer their own circles to the straight path of [[truth]], is, that they measure by their own [[human]], changeable, and narrow [[intellect]] the [[divine]] [[mind]], which is absolutely unchangeable, infinitely capacious, and, without succession of [[thought]], counting all things without number. so that saying of the apostle comes true of them, for, "comparing themselves with themselves, they do not [[understand]]."[549] for because they do, in [[virtue]] of a new [[purpose]], whatever new thing has occurred to them to be done (their minds [[mind]] being changeable), they conclude it is so with [[god]]; and thus compare, not [[god]],—for they cannot conceive [[god]], but [[think]] of one like themselves when they [[think]] of him,—not [[god]], but themselves, and not with him, but with themselves. for our part, we dare not [[believe]] that [[god]] is affected in one way when he works [[work]], in another when he rests. indeed, to say that he is affected at all, is an [[abuse]] of [[language]], since it implies that there comes to be something in his [[nature]] which was not there before. for he who is affected is acted upon, and whatever is acted upon is changeable. in his leisure, therefore, is no laziness, indolence, inactivity; as in his [[work]] is no [[labour]], effort, industry. he can act while he reposes, and repose while he acts. he can begin a new [[work]] with (not a new, but) an eternal design; and what he has not made before, he does not now begin to make because he repents of his former repose. but[pg 507] when one speaks of his former repose and subsequent operation (and i [[know]] not how [[men]] can [[understand]] these things), this "former" and "subsequent" are applied only to the things created, which formerly did not [[exist]], and subsequently came into existence. but in [[god]] the former [[purpose]] is not altered and obliterated by the subsequent and different [[purpose]], but by one and the same eternal and unchangeable will he effected regarding the things he created, both that formerly, so long as they were not, they should not be, and that subsequently, when they began to be, they should come into existence. and thus, perhaps, he would show in a very striking way, to those who have [[eyes]] for such things, how independent he is of what he makes, and how it is of his own gratuitous goodness he creates, since from eternity he dwelt without creatures in no less [[perfect]] a blessedness.

18. against those who assert that things that are infinite[550] cannot be comprehended by the [[knowledge]] of [[god]].

as for their other assertion, that god's [[knowledge]] cannot comprehend things infinite, it only remains for them to affirm, in order that they may sound the depths of their impiety, that [[god]] does not [[know]] all numbers. for it is very [[certain]] that they are infinite; since, no matter at what number you suppose an end to be made, this number can be, i will not say, increased by the addition of one more, but however [[great]] it be, and however vast be the multitude of which it is the [[rational]] and scientific expression, it can still be not only doubled, but even multiplied. moreover, each number is so defined by its own properties [[property]], that no two numbers are [[equal]]. they are therefore both unequal and different from one another; and while they are simply finite, collectively they are infinite. does [[god]], therefore, not [[know]] numbers on account of this infinity; and does his [[knowledge]] extend only to a [[certain]] height in numbers, while of the rest he is ignorant? who is so left to himself as to say so? yet they can hardly pretend to put numbers out of the [[question]], or maintain that they have nothing to do with the [[knowledge]] of [[god]]; for [[plato]],[551] their [[great]] [[authority]], represents [[god]] as framing the [[world]] on[pg 508] numerical principles [[principle]]; and in our books [[book]] also it is said to [[god]], "thou hast ordered all things in number, and measure, and weight."[552] the [[prophet]] also says, "who bringeth out their host by number."[553] and the saviour says in the gospel, "the very hairs of your head are all numbered."[554] far be it, then, from us to [[doubt]] that all number is known to him "whose understanding," according to the psalmist, "is infinite."[555] the infinity of number, though there be no numbering of infinite numbers, is yet not incomprehensible by him whose understanding is infinite. and thus, if everything which is comprehended is defined or made finite by the comprehension of him who knows [[know]] it, then all infinity is in some ineffable way made finite to [[god]], for it is comprehensible by his [[knowledge]]. wherefore, if the infinity of numbers cannot be infinite to the [[knowledge]] of [[god]], by which it is comprehended, what are we [[poor]] creatures that we should presume to fix limits to his [[knowledge]], and say that unless the same temporal things be repeated by the same periodic revolutions [[revolution]], [[god]] cannot either foreknow his creatures that he may make them, or [[know]] them when he has made them? [[god]], whose [[knowledge]] is simply manifold, and uniform in its variety, comprehends all incomprehensibles with so incomprehensible a comprehension, that though he willed always to make his later works [[work]] novel and unlike what went before them, he could not [[produce]] them without order and foresight, nor conceive them suddenly, but by his eternal foreknowledge.

19. of worlds [[world]] without end, or ages [[age]] of ages [[age]].[556]

i do not presume to determine whether [[god]] does so, and whether these times [[time]] which are called "ages of ages" are joined together in a continuous series, and succeed one another with a regulated [[diversity]], and leave exempt from their vicissitudes only those who are freed from their misery, and abide without end in a blessed immortality; or whether these are called "ages of ages [[age]]," that we may [[understand]] that the ages [[age]] remain unchangeable in god's unwavering [[wisdom]], and are the efficient causes, as it were, of those ages [[age]] which are being spent in [[time]].[pg 509] possibly "ages" is used for "age," so that nothing else is meant by "ages of ages" than by "age of [[age]]," as nothing else is meant by "heavens of heavens" than by "heaven of [[heaven]]." for [[god]] called the firmament, above which are the waters, "heaven," and yet the psalm says, "let the waters that are above the heavens [[heaven]] [[praise]] the name of the [[lord]]."[557] which of these two meanings we are to attach to "ages of ages [[age]]," or whether there is not some other and [[better]] meaning still, is a very profound [[question]]; and the [[subject]] we are at [[present]] handling presents [[present]] no obstacle to our meanwhile deferring the discussion of it, whether we may be able to determine anything about it, or may only be made more cautious by its further treatment, so as to be deterred from making any rash affirmations in a matter of such obscurity. for at [[present]] we are disputing the [[opinion]] that affirms the existence of those periodic revolutions [[revolution]] by which the same things are always recurring at intervals of [[time]]. now, whichever of these suppositions regarding the "ages of ages" be the true one, it avails nothing for the substantiating of those cycles; for whether the ages [[age]] of ages [[age]] be not a repetition of the same [[world]], but different worlds [[world]] succeeding one another in a regulated connection, the ransomed souls [[soul]] abiding in well-assured bliss without any recurrence of misery, or whether the ages [[age]] of ages [[age]] be the eternal causes which [[rule]] what shall be and is in [[time]], it equally follows, that those cycles which bring round the same things have no existence; and nothing more thoroughly explodes them than the [[fact]] of the eternal [[life]] of the saints.

20. of the impiety of those who assert that the souls [[soul]] which enjoy true and [[perfect]] blessedness, must yet again and again in these periodic revolutions [[revolution]] return to [[labour]] and misery.

what pious ears could bear to hear that after a [[life]] spent in so many and severe distresses (if, indeed, that should be called a [[life]] at all which is rather a [[death]], so utter that the [[love]] of this [[present]] [[death]] makes us [[fear]] that [[death]] which delivers us from it), that after evils [[evil]] so disastrous, and miseries of all kinds [[kind]] have at length been expiated and finished by the [[help]] of true [[religion]] and [[wisdom]], and when we have thus attained to the vision of [[god]], and have entered into bliss by the contemplation[pg 510] of [[spiritual]] [[light]] and participation in his unchangeable immortality, which we burn to attain,—that we must at some [[time]] lose all this, and that they who do lose it are cast down from that eternity, [[truth]], and felicity to infernal [[mortality]] and shameful foolishness, and are involved in accursed woes, in which [[god]] is lost, [[truth]] held in detestation, and [[happiness]] sought in iniquitous impurities? and that this will happen endlessly again and again, recurring at fixed intervals, and in regularly returning periods? and that this everlasting and ceaseless [[revolution]] of definite cycles, which remove and restore true misery and deceitful bliss in turn, is contrived in order that [[god]] may be able to [[know]] his own works [[work]], since on the one hand he cannot rest from creating, and on the other, cannot [[know]] the infinite number of his creatures, if he always makes creatures? who, i say, can listen to such things? who can accept or suffer them to be spoken? were they true, it were not only more prudent to keep [[silence]] regarding them, but even (to express myself as [[best]] i can) it were the part of [[wisdom]] not to [[know]] them. for if in the future [[world]] we shall not [[remember]] these things, and by this oblivion be blessed, why should we now increase our misery, already burdensome enough, by the [[knowledge]] of them? if, on the other hand, the [[knowledge]] of them will be forced upon us hereafter, now at least let us remain in ignorance, that in the [[present]] expectation we may enjoy a blessedness which the future reality is not to bestow; since in this [[life]] we are expecting to obtain [[life]] everlasting, but in the [[world]] to come are to discover it to be blessed, but not everlasting.

and if they maintain that no one can attain to the blessedness of the [[world]] to come, unless in this [[life]] he has been indoctrinated in those cycles in which bliss and misery relieve one another, how do they avow that the more a [[man]] loves [[love]] [[god]], the more readily he attains to blessedness,—they who [[teach]] what paralyzes [[love]] itself? for who would not be more remiss and lukewarm in his [[love]] for a [[person]] whom he thinks [[think]] he shall be forced to abandon, and whose [[truth]] and [[wisdom]] he shall come to hate; and this, too, after he has quite attained to the utmost and most blissful [[knowledge]] of him that he is capable of? can any one be faithful in his [[love]], even to a[pg 511] [[human]] friend, if he knows [[know]] that he is destined to become his [[enemy]]?[558] [[god]] forbid that there be any [[truth]] in an [[opinion]] which threatens us with a real misery that is never to end, but is often and endlessly to be interrupted by intervals of fallacious [[happiness]]. for what [[happiness]] can be more fallacious and false than that in whose blaze of [[truth]] we yet remain ignorant that we shall be miserable, or in whose most secure citadel we yet [[fear]] that we shall be so? for if, on the one hand, we are to be ignorant of coming calamity, then our [[present]] misery is not so shortsighted, for it is assured of coming bliss. if, on the other hand, the disaster that threatens is not concealed from us in the [[world]] to come, then the [[time]] of misery which is to be at [[last]] exchanged for a [[state]] of blessedness, is spent by the [[soul]] more happily than its [[time]] of [[happiness]], which is to end in a return to misery. and thus our expectation of unhappiness is [[happy]], but of [[happiness]] unhappy. and therefore, as we here suffer [[present]] ills, and hereafter [[fear]] ills that are imminent, it were truer to say that we shall always be miserable, than that we can some [[time]] be [[happy]].

but these things are declared to be false by the loud testimony of [[religion]] and [[truth]]; for [[religion]] truthfully promises a true blessedness, of which we shall be eternally assured, and which cannot be interrupted by any disaster. let us therefore keep to the straight path, which is [[christ]], and, with him as our guide and saviour, let us turn away in [[heart]] and [[mind]] from the unreal and futile cycles of the godless. porphyry, platonist though he was, abjured the [[opinion]] of his school, that in these cycles souls [[soul]] are ceaselessly passing away and returning, either being struck with the extravagance of the [[idea]], or sobered by his [[knowledge]] of [[christianity]]. as i mentioned in the tenth [[book]],[559] he preferred saying that the [[soul]], as it had been sent into the [[world]] that it might [[know]] [[evil]], and be purged and delivered from it, was never again exposed to such an [[experience]] after it had once returned to[pg 512] the [[father]]. and if he abjured the tenets of his school, how much more ought we christians [[christian]] to abominate and avoid an [[opinion]] so unfounded and hostile to our [[faith]]? but having disposed of these cycles and escaped out of them, no necessity compels us to suppose that the [[human]] [[race]] had no beginning in [[time]], on the ground that there is nothing new in [[nature]] which, by i [[know]] not what cycles, has not at some previous period existed, and is not hereafter to [[exist]] again. for if the [[soul]], once delivered, as it never was before, is never to return to misery, then there happens in its [[experience]] something which never happened before; and this, indeed, something of the [[greatest]] consequence, to wit, the secure entrance into eternal felicity. and if in an [[immortal]] [[nature]] there can occur a novelty, which never has been, nor ever shall be, reproduced by any cycle, why is it disputed that the same may occur in mortal natures [[nature]]? if they maintain that blessedness is no new [[experience]] to the [[soul]], but only a return to that [[state]] in which it has been eternally, then at least its deliverance from misery is something new, since, by their own showing, the misery from which it is delivered is itself, too, a new [[experience]]. and if this new [[experience]] fell out by accident, and was not embraced in the order of things appointed by [[divine]] providence, then where are those determinate and measured cycles in which no new thing happens, but all things are reproduced as they were before? if, however, this new [[experience]] was embraced in that providential order of [[nature]] (whether the [[soul]] was exposed to the [[evil]] of this [[world]] for the sake of discipline, or fell into it by sin), then it is possible for new things to happen which never happened before, and which yet are not extraneous to the order of [[nature]]. and if the [[soul]] is able by its own imprudence to create for itself a new misery, which was not unforeseen by the [[divine]] providence, but was provided for in the order of [[nature]] along with the deliverance from it, how can we, even with all the rashness of [[human]] vanity, presume to deny that [[god]] can create new things—new to the [[world]], but not to him—which he never before created, but yet foresaw from all eternity? if they say that it is indeed true that ransomed souls [[soul]] return no more to misery, but that even so no new thing[pg 513] happens, since there always have been, now are, and ever shall be a succession of ransomed souls [[soul]], they must at least grant that in this case there are new souls [[soul]] to whom the misery and the deliverance from it are new. for if they maintain that those souls [[soul]] out of which new [[men]] are daily being made (from whose bodies [[body]], if they have lived wisely, they are so delivered that they never return to misery) are not new, but have existed from eternity, they must logically admit that they are infinite. for however [[great]] a finite number of souls [[soul]] there were, that would not have sufficed to make perpetually new [[men]] from eternity,—men whose souls [[soul]] were to be eternally freed from this mortal [[state]], and never afterwards to return to it. and our [[philosophers]] will find it hard to explain how there is an infinite number of souls [[soul]] in an order of [[nature]] which they require shall be finite, that it may be known by [[god]].

and now that we have exploded these cycles which were supposed to bring back the [[soul]] at fixed periods to the same miseries, what can seem more in accordance with godly [[reason]] than to [[believe]] that it is possible for [[god]] both to create new things never before created, and in doing so, to preserve his will unaltered? but whether the number of eternally redeemed souls [[soul]] can be continually increased or not, let the [[philosophers]] themselves decide, who are so subtle in determining where infinity cannot be admitted. for our own part, our reasoning holds in either case. for if the number of souls [[soul]] can be indefinitely increased, what [[reason]] is there to deny that what had never before been created, could be created? since the number of ransomed souls [[soul]] never existed before, and has yet not only been once made, but will never cease to be anew coming into being. if, on the other hand, it be more suitable that the number of eternally ransomed souls [[soul]] be definite, and that this number will never be increased, yet this number, whatever it be, did assuredly never [[exist]] before, and it cannot increase, and reach the amount it signifies, without having some beginning; and this beginning never before existed. that this beginning, therefore, might be, the first [[man]] was created.

21. that there was created at first but one [[individual]], and that the [[human]] [[race]] was created in him.

now that we have solved, as well as we could, this very[pg 514] difficult [[question]] about the eternal [[god]] creating new things, without any novelty of will, it is easy to see how much [[better]] it is that [[god]] was pleased to [[produce]] the [[human]] [[race]] from the one [[individual]] whom he created, than if he had originated it in several [[men]]. for as to the other animals, he created some solitary, and naturally seeking lonely places,—as the eagles, kites, lions, wolves, and such like; others gregarious, which herd together, and prefer to [[live]] in company,—as pigeons, starlings, stags, and little fallow deer, and the like: but neither class did he cause to be propagated from individuals [[individual]], but called into being several at once. [[man]], on the other hand, whose [[nature]] was to be a mean between the angelic and bestial, he created in such sort, that if he remained in subjection to his creator as his rightful [[lord]], and piously kept his commandments, he should pass into the company of the angels, and obtain, without the intervention of [[death]],[560] a blessed and endless immortality; but if he offended the [[lord]] his [[god]] by a proud and disobedient use of his [[free]] will, he should become [[subject]] to [[death]], and [[live]] as the beasts do,—the [[slave]] of appetite, and doomed to eternal [[punishment]] after [[death]]. and therefore [[god]] created only one [[single]] [[man]], not, certainly, that he might be a solitary bereft of all [[society]], but that by this means the unity of [[society]] and the bond of concord might be more effectually commended to him, [[men]] being bound together not only by similarity of [[nature]], but by [[family]] affection. and indeed he did not even create the woman that was to be given him as his [[wife]], as he created the [[man]], but created her out of the [[man]], that the whole [[human]] [[race]] might derive from one [[man]].

22. that [[god]] foreknew that the first [[man]] would [[sin]], and that he at the same [[time]] foresaw how large a multitude of godly persons [[person]] would by his grace be translated to the fellowship of the angels.

and [[god]] was not ignorant that [[man]] would [[sin]], and that, being himself made [[subject]] now to [[death]], he would propagate [[men]] doomed to [[die]], and that these mortals would run to such enormities in [[sin]], that even the beasts devoid of [[rational]] will, and who were created in numbers from the waters and the [[earth]], would [[live]] more securely and peaceably with their own[pg 515] [[kind]] than [[men]], who had been propagated from one [[individual]] for the very [[purpose]] of commending concord. for not even lions or dragons have ever waged with their [[kind]] such wars [[war]] as [[men]] have waged with one another.[561] but [[god]] foresaw also that by his grace a [[people]] would be called to adoption, and that they, being justified by the remission of their sins [[sin]], would be [[united]] by the holy ghost to the holy angels in eternal [[peace]], the [[last]] [[enemy]], [[death]], being destroyed; and he knew that this [[people]] would derive [[profit]] from the consideration that [[god]] had caused all [[men]] to be derived from one, for the sake of showing how highly he prizes unity in a multitude.

23. of the [[nature]] of the [[human]] [[soul]] created in the image of [[god]].

god, then, made [[man]] in his own image. for he created for him a [[soul]] endowed with [[reason]] and [[intelligence]], so that he might excel all the creatures of [[earth]], air, and sea, which were not so gifted. and when he had formed the [[man]] out of the dust of the [[earth]], and had willed that his [[soul]] should be such as i have said,—whether he had already made it, and now by breathing imparted it to [[man]], or rather made it by breathing, so that that breath which [[god]] made by breathing (for what else is "to breathe" than to make breath?) is the [[soul]],[562]—he made also a [[wife]] for him, to aid him in the [[work]] of generating his [[kind]], and her he formed of a bone taken out of the man's [[man]] side, working in a [[divine]] manner. for we are not to conceive of this [[work]] in a carnal [[fashion]], as if [[god]] wrought as we commonly see artisans, who use their hands, and material furnished to them, that by their artistic [[skill]] they may [[fashion]] some material object. god's hand is god's [[power]]; and he, working invisibly, effects visible results. but this seems fabulous rather than true to [[men]], who measure[pg 516] by customary and everyday works [[work]] the [[power]] and [[wisdom]] of [[god]], whereby he understands and produces [[produce]] without seeds even seeds themselves; and because they cannot [[understand]] the things which at the beginning were created, they are sceptical regarding them—as if the very things which they do [[know]] about [[human]] propagation, conceptions and births, would seem less incredible if told to those who had no [[experience]] of them; though these very things, too, are attributed by many rather to physical and [[natural]] causes than to the [[work]] of the [[divine]] [[mind]].

24. whether the angels can be said to be the creators of any, even the least creature.

but in this [[book]] we have nothing to do with those who do not [[believe]] that the [[divine]] [[mind]] made or cares [[care]] for this [[world]]. as for those who [[believe]] their own [[plato]], that all mortal animals—among whom [[man]] holds the pre-eminent place, and is near to the gods themselves—were created not by that most high [[god]] who made the [[world]], but by other lesser gods created by the supreme, and exercising a delegated [[power]] under his control,—if only those persons [[person]] be delivered from the superstition which prompts them to seek a plausible [[reason]] for paying [[divine]] honours [[honour]] and sacrificing to these gods as their creators, they will easily be disentangled also from this their error. for it is blasphemy to [[believe]] or to say (even before it can be understood) that any other than [[god]] is creator of any [[nature]], be it never so small and mortal. and as for the angels, whom those platonists prefer to call gods, although they do, so far as they are permitted and commissioned, aid in the production of the things around us, yet not on that account are we to call them creators, any more than we call gardeners the creators of fruits and trees.

25. that [[god]] alone is the creator of every [[kind]] of creature, whatever its [[nature]] or form.

for whereas there is one form which is given from without to every bodily substance,—such as the form which is constructed by potters and smiths, and that class of artists who paint and [[fashion]] forms like the [[body]] of animals,—but another and internal form which is not itself constructed, but, as the efficient cause, produces [[produce]] not only the [[natural]] bodily[pg 517] forms, but even the [[life]] itself of the living creatures, and which proceeds from the secret and hidden [[choice]] of an [[intelligent]] and living [[nature]],—let that first-mentioned form be attributed to every artificer, but this latter to one only, [[god]], the creator and originator who made the [[world]] itself and the angels, without the [[help]] of [[world]] or angels. for the same [[divine]] and, so to speak, creative energy, which cannot be made, but makes, and which gave to the [[earth]] and [[sky]] their roundness,—this same [[divine]], effective, and creative energy gave their roundness to the eye and to the apple; and the other [[natural]] objects which we anywhere see, received also their form, not from without, but from the secret and profound might of the creator, who said, "do not i fill [[heaven]] and [[earth]]?"[563] and whose [[wisdom]] it is that "reacheth from one end to another mightily; and sweetly doth she order all things."[564] wherefore i [[know]] not what [[kind]] of aid the angels, themselves created first, afforded to the creator in making other things. i cannot ascribe to them what perhaps they cannot do, neither ought i to deny them such faculty as they have. but, by their leave, i attribute the creating and originating [[work]] which gave being to all natures [[nature]] to [[god]], to whom they themselves thankfully ascribe their existence. we do not call gardeners the creators of their fruits, for we [[read]], "neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but [[god]] that giveth the increase."[565] nay, not even the [[earth]] itself do we call a creator, though she seems to be the prolific [[mother]] of all things which she aids in germinating and bursting forth from the seed, and which she keeps rooted in her own breast; for we likewise [[read]], "god giveth it a [[body]], as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own [[body]]."[566] we ought not even to call a woman the creatress of her own offspring; for he rather is its creator who said to his servant, "before i formed thee in the womb, i knew thee."[567] and although the various mental emotions of a pregnant woman do [[produce]] in the fruit of her womb similar qualities,—as jacob with his peeled wands caused piebald sheep to be produced,—yet the [[mother]] as little creates her[pg 518] offspring, as she created herself. whatever bodily or seminal causes, then, may be used for the production of things, either by the co-operation of angels, [[men]], or the lower animals, or by [[sexual]] [[generation]]; and whatever [[power]] the desires [[desire]] and mental emotions of the [[mother]] have to [[produce]] in the tender and plastic fœtus, corresponding lineaments and colours; yet the natures [[nature]] themselves, which are thus variously affected, are the production of none but the most high [[god]]. it is his occult [[power]] which pervades all things, and is [[present]] in all without being contaminated, which gives being to all that is, and modifies and limits its existence; so that without him it would not be thus or thus, nor would have any being at all.[568] if, then, in regard to that outward form which the workman's hand imposes on his [[work]], we do not say that [[rome]] and alexandria were built by masons and architects, but by the kings [[king]] by whose will, plan, and resources they were built, so that the one has romulus, the other alexander, for its founder; with how much greater [[reason]] ought we to say that [[god]] alone is the author of all natures [[nature]], since he neither uses for his [[work]] any material which was not made by him, nor any workmen who were not also made by him, and since, if he were, so to speak, to withdraw from created things his creative [[power]], they would straightway relapse into the nothingness in which they were before they were created? "before," i mean, in [[respect]] of eternity, not of [[time]]. for what other creator could there be of [[time]], than he who created those things whose movements make [[time]]?[569]

26. of that [[opinion]] of the platonists, that the angels were themselves indeed created by [[god]], but that afterwards they created man's [[man]] [[body]].

it is obvious, that in attributing the creation of the other animals to those inferior gods who were made by the supreme, he meant it to be understood that the [[immortal]] part was taken from [[god]] himself, and that these minor creators added the mortal part; that is to say, he meant them to be considered the creators of our bodies [[body]], but not of our souls [[soul]]. but since porphyry maintains that if the [[soul]] is to be purified, all entanglement with a [[body]] must be escaped from; and at the same [[time]] agrees with [[plato]] and the platonists in[pg 519] thinking that those who have not spent a temperate and honourable [[life]] return to mortal bodies [[body]] as their [[punishment]] (to bodies [[body]] of brutes in plato's [[opinion]], to [[human]] bodies [[body]] in porphyry's); it follows that those whom they would have us [[worship]] as our parents and authors, that they may plausibly call them gods, are, after all, but the forgers of our fetters and chains,—not our creators, but our jailers and turnkeys, who lock us up in the most bitter and melancholy house of correction. let the platonists, then, either cease menacing us with our bodies [[body]] as the [[punishment]] of our souls [[soul]], or preaching that we are to [[worship]] as gods those whose [[work]] upon us they exhort us by all means in our [[power]] to avoid and escape from. but, indeed, both opinions [[opinion]] are quite false. it is false that souls [[soul]] return again to this [[life]] to be punished; and it is false that there is any other creator of anything in [[heaven]] or [[earth]], than he who made the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]. for if we [[live]] in a [[body]] only to expiate our sins [[sin]], how says [[plato]] in another place, that the [[world]] could not have been the most beautiful and [[good]], had it not been filled with all kinds [[kind]] of creatures, mortal and [[immortal]]?[570] but if our creation even as mortals be a [[divine]] benefit, how is it a [[punishment]] to be restored to a [[body]], that is, to a [[divine]] benefit? and if [[god]], as [[plato]] continually maintains, embraced in his eternal [[intelligence]] the ideas [[idea]] both of the [[universe]] and of all the animals, how, then, should he not with his own hand make them all? could he be unwilling to be the constructor of works [[work]], the [[idea]] and plan of which called for his ineffable and ineffably to be praised [[intelligence]]?

27. that the whole plenitude of the [[human]] [[race]] was embraced in the first [[man]], and that [[god]] there saw the portion of it which was to be honoured and rewarded, and that which was to be condemned and punished.

with [[good]] cause, therefore, does the true [[religion]] recognise and proclaim that the same [[god]] who created the universal cosmos, created also all the animals, souls [[soul]] as well as bodies [[body]]. among the terrestrial animals [[man]] was made by him in his[pg 520] own image, and, for the [[reason]] i have given, was made one [[individual]], though he was not left solitary. for there is nothing so social by [[nature]], so unsocial by its [[corruption]], as this [[race]]. and [[human]] [[nature]] has nothing more appropriate, either for the prevention of discord, or for the healing of it, where it exists, than the remembrance of that first parent of us all, whom [[god]] was pleased to create alone, that all [[men]] might be derived from one, and that they might thus be admonished to preserve unity among their whole multitude. but from the [[fact]] that the woman was made for him from his side, it was plainly meant that we should learn how dear the bond between [[man]] and [[wife]] should be. these works [[work]] of [[god]] do certainly seem extraordinary, because they are the first works [[work]]. they who do not [[believe]] them, ought not to [[believe]] any prodigies; for these would not be called prodigies did they not happen out of the ordinary course of [[nature]]. but, is it possible that anything should happen in [[vain]], however hidden be its cause, in so grand a [[government]] of [[divine]] providence? one of the [[sacred]] psalmists says, "come, behold the works [[work]] of the [[lord]], what prodigies he hath wrought in the [[earth]]."[571] why [[god]] made woman out of man's [[man]] side, and what this first prodigy prefigured, i shall, with god's [[help]], tell in another place. but at [[present]], since this [[book]] must be concluded, let us merely say that in this first [[man]], who was created in the beginning, there was laid the foundation, not indeed evidently, but in god's foreknowledge, of these two cities [[city]] or societies [[society]], so far as regards the [[human]] [[race]]. for from that [[man]] all [[men]] were to be derived—some of them to be associated with the [[good]] angels in their [[reward]], others with the wicked in [[punishment]]; all being ordered by the secret yet just [[judgment]] of [[god]]. for since it is written, "all the paths of the [[lord]] are [[mercy]] and [[truth]],"[572] neither can his grace be [[unjust]], nor his [[justice]] cruel.

argument.

in this [[book]] it is taught that [[death]] is penal, and had its origin in adam's [[sin]].

1. of the fall of the first [[man]], through which [[mortality]] has been contracted.

having disposed of the very difficult questions [[question]] concerning the origin of our [[world]] and the beginning of the [[human]] [[race]], the [[natural]] order requires that we now discuss the fall of the first [[man]] (we may say of the first men), and of the origin and propagation of [[human]] [[death]]. for [[god]] had not made [[man]] like the angels, in such a condition that, even though they had sinned, they could none the more [[die]]. he had so made them, that if they discharged the obligations of [[obedience]], an angelic immortality and a blessed eternity might ensue, without the intervention of [[death]]; but if they disobeyed, [[death]] should be visited on them with just sentence—which, too, has been spoken to in the preceding [[book]].

2. of that [[death]] which can affect an [[immortal]] [[soul]], and of that to which the [[body]] is [[subject]].

but i see i must speak a little more carefully of the [[nature]] of [[death]]. for although the [[human]] [[soul]] is truly affirmed to be [[immortal]], yet it also has a [[certain]] [[death]] of its own. for it is therefore called [[immortal]], because, in a sense, it does not cease to [[live]] and to [[feel]]; while the [[body]] is called mortal, because it can be forsaken of all [[life]], and cannot by itself [[live]] at all. the [[death]], then, of the [[soul]] takes place when [[god]] forsakes it, as the [[death]] of the [[body]] when the [[soul]] forsakes it. therefore the [[death]] of both—that is, of the whole man—occurs when the [[soul]], forsaken by [[god]], forsakes the [[body]]. for, in this case, neither is [[god]] the [[life]] of the [[soul]], nor the [[soul]] the [[life]] of the [[body]]. and this [[death]] of the whole [[man]] is followed by that which, on the authority[pg 522] of the [[divine]] oracles, we call the second [[death]]. this the saviour referred to when he said, "fear him which is able to [[destroy]] both [[soul]] and [[body]] in hell."[573] and since this does not happen before the [[soul]] is so joined to its [[body]] that they cannot be separated at all, it may be matter of wonder how the [[body]] can be said to be killed by that [[death]] in which it is not forsaken by the [[soul]], but, being animated and rendered sensitive by it, is tormented. for in that penal and everlasting [[punishment]], of which in its own place we are to speak more at large, the [[soul]] is justly said to [[die]], because it does not [[live]] in connection with [[god]]; but how can we say that the [[body]] is [[dead]], seeing that it lives [[life]] by the [[soul]]? for it could not otherwise [[feel]] the bodily torments which are to [[follow]] the resurrection. is it because [[life]] of every [[kind]] is [[good]], and [[pain]] an [[evil]], that we decline to say that that [[body]] lives [[life]], in which the [[soul]] is the cause, not of [[life]], but of [[pain]]? the [[soul]], then, lives [[life]] by [[god]] when it lives [[life]] well, for it cannot [[live]] well unless by [[god]] working in it what is [[good]]; and the [[body]] lives [[life]] by the [[soul]] when the [[soul]] lives [[life]] in the [[body]], whether itself be living by [[god]] or no. for the wicked man's [[man]] [[life]] in the [[body]] is a [[life]] not of the [[soul]], but of the [[body]], which even [[dead]] souls—that is, souls [[soul]] forsaken of god—can confer upon bodies [[body]], how little soever of their own proper [[life]], by which they are [[immortal]], they retain. but in the [[last]] damnation, though [[man]] does not cease to [[feel]], yet because this feeling of his is neither sweet with [[pleasure]] nor wholesome with repose, but painfully penal, it is not without [[reason]] called [[death]] rather than [[life]]. and it is called the second [[death]] because it follows the first, which sunders the two cohering essences, whether these be [[god]] and the [[soul]], or the [[soul]] and the [[body]]. of the first and bodily [[death]], then, we may say that to the [[good]] it is [[good]], and [[evil]] to the [[evil]]. but, doubtless, the second, as it happens to none of the [[good]], so it can be [[good]] for none.

3. whether [[death]], which by the [[sin]] of our first parents has passed upon all [[men]], is the [[punishment]] of [[sin]], even to the [[good]].

but a [[question]] not to be shirked arises: whether in very [[truth]] [[death]], which separates [[soul]] and [[body]], is [[good]] to the[pg 523] [[good]]?[574] for if it be, how has it come to pass that such a thing should be the [[punishment]] of [[sin]]? for the first [[men]] would not have [[suffered]] [[death]] had they not sinned. how, then, can that be [[good]] to the [[good]], which could not have happened except to the [[evil]]? then, again, if it could only happen to the [[evil]], to the [[good]] it ought not to be [[good]], but non-existent. for why should there be any [[punishment]] where there is nothing to punish? wherefore we must say that the first [[men]] were indeed so created, that if they had not sinned, they would not have experienced any [[kind]] of [[death]]; but that, having become sinners, they were so punished with [[death]], that whatsoever sprang from their stock should also be punished with the same [[death]]. for nothing else could be born of them than that which they themselves had been. their [[nature]] was deteriorated in proportion to the greatness of the condemnation of their [[sin]], so that what existed as [[punishment]] in those who first sinned, became a [[natural]] consequence in their [[children]]. for [[man]] is not produced by [[man]], as he was from the dust. for dust was the material out of which [[man]] was made: [[man]] is the parent by whom [[man]] is begotten. wherefore [[earth]] and flesh are not the same thing, though flesh be made of [[earth]]. but as [[man]] the parent is, such is [[man]] the offspring. in the first [[man]], therefore, there existed the whole [[human]] [[nature]], which was to be transmitted by the woman to [[posterity]], when that conjugal union received the [[divine]] sentence of its own condemnation; and what [[man]] was made, not when created, but when he sinned and was punished, this he propagated, so far as the origin of [[sin]] and [[death]] are concerned. for neither by [[sin]] nor its [[punishment]] was he himself reduced to that infantine and helpless infirmity of [[body]] and [[mind]] which we see in [[children]]. for [[god]] ordained that infants should begin the [[world]] as the [[young]] of beasts begin it, since their parents had fallen to the level of the beasts in the [[fashion]] of their [[life]] and of their [[death]]; as it is written, "man when he was in [[honour]] understood not; he became like the beasts that have no understanding."[575] nay more,[pg 524] infants, we see, are even feebler in the use and movement of their limbs, and more infirm to choose and refuse, than the most tender offspring of other animals; as if the [[force]] that dwells in [[human]] [[nature]] were destined to surpass all other living things so much the more eminently, as its energy has been longer restrained, and the [[time]] of its exercise delayed, just as an arrow flies the higher the further back it has been drawn. to this infantine imbecility[576] the first [[man]] did not fall by his lawless presumption and just sentence; but [[human]] [[nature]] was in his [[person]] vitiated and altered to such an extent, that he [[suffered]] in his members the warring of disobedient [[lust]], and became [[subject]] to the necessity of dying. and what he himself had become by [[sin]] and [[punishment]], such he generated those whom he begot; that is to say, [[subject]] to [[sin]] and [[death]]. and if infants are delivered from this bondage of [[sin]] by the redeemer's grace, they can suffer only this [[death]] which separates [[soul]] and [[body]]; but being redeemed from the obligation of [[sin]], they do not pass to that second endless and penal [[death]].

4. why [[death]], the [[punishment]] of [[sin]], is not withheld from those who by the grace of regeneration are absolved from [[sin]].

if, moreover, any one is solicitous about this point, how, if [[death]] be the very [[punishment]] of [[sin]], they whose guilt is cancelled by grace do yet suffer [[death]], this difficulty has already been handled and solved in our other [[work]] which we have written on the baptism of infants.[577] there it was said that the parting of [[soul]] and [[body]] was left, though its connection with [[sin]] was removed, for this [[reason]], that if the immortality of the [[body]] followed immediately upon the sacrament of regeneration, [[faith]] itself would be thereby enervated. for [[faith]] is then only [[faith]] when it waits in [[hope]] for what is not yet seen in substance. and by the vigour and conflict of [[faith]], at least in times [[time]] [[past]], was the [[fear]] of [[death]] overcome. specially was this conspicuous in the holy martyrs, who could have had no [[victory]], no [[glory]], to whom there could not even have been any conflict, if, after the laver of regeneration, saints could not suffer[pg 525] bodily [[death]]. who would not, then, in company with the infants presented for baptism, run to the grace of [[christ]], that so he might not be dismissed from the [[body]]? and thus [[faith]] would not be tested with an unseen [[reward]]; and so would not even be [[faith]], seeking and receiving an immediate recompense of its works [[work]]. but now, by the greater and more admirable grace of the saviour, the [[punishment]] of [[sin]] is turned to the service of [[righteousness]]. for then it was proclaimed to [[man]], "if thou sinnest, thou shalt [[die]];" now it is said to the martyr, "die, that thou [[sin]] not." then it was said, "if ye transgress the commandments, ye shall [[die]];" now it is said, "if ye decline [[death]], ye transgress the commandment." that which was formerly set as an object of terror, that [[men]] might not [[sin]], is now to be undergone if we would not [[sin]]. thus, by the unutterable [[mercy]] of [[god]], even the very [[punishment]] of wickedness has become the armour of [[virtue]], and the penalty of the sinner becomes the [[reward]] of the righteous. for then [[death]] was incurred by sinning, now [[righteousness]] is fulfilled by dying. in the case of the holy martyrs it is so; for to them the persecutor proposes the alternative, apostasy or [[death]]. for the righteous prefer by believing to suffer what the first transgressors [[suffered]] by not believing. for unless they had sinned, they would not have died; but the martyrs [[sin]] if they do not [[die]]. the one died because they sinned, the others do not [[sin]] because they [[die]]. by the guilt of the first, [[punishment]] was incurred; by the [[punishment]] of the second, guilt is prevented. not that [[death]], which was before an [[evil]], has become something [[good]], but only that [[god]] has granted to [[faith]] this grace, that [[death]], which is the admitted opposite to [[life]], should become the instrument by which [[life]] is reached.

5. as the wicked make an ill use of the [[law]], which is [[good]], so the [[good]] make a [[good]] use of [[death]], which is an ill.

the apostle, wishing to show how hurtful a thing [[sin]] is, when grace does not aid us, has not hesitated to say that the [[strength]] of [[sin]] is that very [[law]] by which [[sin]] is prohibited. "the sting of [[death]] is [[sin]], and the [[strength]] of [[sin]] is the [[law]]."[578] most certainly true; for prohibition increases the [[desire]] of illicit action, if [[righteousness]] is not so loved that the [[desire]] of[pg 526] [[sin]] is conquered by that [[love]]. but unless [[divine]] grace aid us, we cannot [[love]] nor delight in true [[righteousness]]. but lest the [[law]] should be [[thought]] to be an [[evil]], since it is called the [[strength]] of [[sin]], the apostle, when treating a similar [[question]] in another place, says, "the [[law]] indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and [[good]]. was then that which is holy made [[death]] unto me? [[god]] forbid. but [[sin]], that it might appear [[sin]], working [[death]] in me by that which is [[good]]; that [[sin]] by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."[579] exceeding, he says, because the transgression is more heinous when through the increasing [[lust]] of [[sin]] the [[law]] itself also is despised. why have we [[thought]] it worth while to mention this? for this [[reason]], because, as the [[law]] is not an [[evil]] when it increases the [[lust]] of those who [[sin]], so neither is [[death]] a [[good]] thing when it increases the [[glory]] of those who suffer it, since either the former is abandoned wickedly, and makes transgressors, or the latter is embraced for the truth's sake, and makes martyrs. and thus the [[law]] is indeed [[good]], because it is prohibition of [[sin]], and [[death]] is [[evil]] because it is the wages of [[sin]]; but as wicked [[men]] make an [[evil]] use not only of [[evil]], but also of [[good]] things, so the righteous make a [[good]] use not only of [[good]], but also of [[evil]] things. whence it comes to pass that the wicked make an ill use of the [[law]], though the [[law]] is [[good]]; and that the [[good]] [[die]] well, though [[death]] is an [[evil]].

6. of the [[evil]] of [[death]] in general, considered as the separation of [[soul]] and [[body]].

wherefore, as regards bodily [[death]], that is, the separation of the [[soul]] from the [[body]], it is [[good]] unto none while it is being endured by those whom we say are in the article of [[death]]. for the very [[violence]] with which [[body]] and [[soul]] are wrenched asunder, which in the living had been conjoined and closely intertwined, brings with it a harsh [[experience]], jarring horridly on [[nature]] so long as it continues, till there comes a total loss of sensation, which arose from the very interpenetration of spirit and flesh. and all this anguish is sometimes forestalled by one stroke of the [[body]] or sudden flitting of the [[soul]], the swiftness of which prevents it from being [[felt]]. but whatever that may be in the dying which[pg 527] with violently painful sensation robs of all sensation, yet, when it is piously and faithfully borne, it increases the [[merit]] of patience, but does not make the name of [[punishment]] inapplicable. [[death]], proceeding by ordinary [[generation]] from the first [[man]], is the [[punishment]] of all who are born of him, yet, if it be endured for righteousness' sake, it becomes the [[glory]] of those who are born again; and though [[death]] be the award of [[sin]], it sometimes secures that nothing be awarded to [[sin]].

7. of the [[death]] which the unbaptized[580] suffer for the [[confession]] of [[christ]].

for whatever unbaptized persons [[person]] [[die]] confessing [[christ]], this [[confession]] is of the same efficacy for the remission of sins [[sin]] as if they were washed in the [[sacred]] font of baptism. for he who said, "except a [[man]] be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the [[kingdom]] of [[god]],"[581] made also an exception in their favour, in that other sentence where he no less absolutely said, "whosoever shall confess me before [[men]], him will i confess also before my [[father]] which is in [[heaven]];"[582] and in another place, "whosoever will lose his [[life]] for my sake, shall find it."[583] and this explains the verse, "precious in the sight of the [[lord]] is the [[death]] of his saints."[584] for what is more precious than a [[death]] by which a man's [[man]] sins [[sin]] are all forgiven, and his merits [[merit]] increased an hundredfold? for those who have been baptized when they could no longer escape [[death]], and have departed this [[life]] with all their sins [[sin]] blotted out, have not [[equal]] [[merit]] with those who did not defer [[death]], though it was in their [[power]] to do so, but preferred to end their [[life]] by confessing [[christ]], rather than by denying him to secure an opportunity of baptism. and even had they denied him under pressure of the [[fear]] of [[death]], this too would have been forgiven them in that baptism, in which was remitted even the enormous wickedness of those who had slain [[christ]]. but how abundant in these [[men]] must have been the grace of the spirit, who breathes where he listeth, seeing that they so dearly loved [[christ]] as to be unable to deny him even in so sore an emergency, and with so sure a [[hope]] of pardon! precious, therefore, is the [[death]] of the saints, to[pg 528] whom the grace of [[christ]] has been applied with such gracious effects, that they do not hesitate to meet [[death]] themselves, if so be they might meet him. and precious is it, also, because it has proved that what was originally ordained for the [[punishment]] of the sinner, has been used for the production of a richer harvest of [[righteousness]]. but not on this account should we look upon [[death]] as a [[good]] thing, for it is diverted to such useful purposes [[purpose]], not by any [[virtue]] of its own, but by the [[divine]] interference. [[death]] was originally proposed as an object of dread, that [[sin]] might not be committed; now it must be undergone that [[sin]] may not be committed, or, if committed, be remitted, and the award of [[righteousness]] bestowed on him whose [[victory]] has earned it.

8. that the saints, by suffering the first [[death]] for the truth's sake, are freed from the second.

for if we look at the matter a little more carefully, we shall see that even when a [[man]] dies faithfully and laudably for the truth's sake, it is still [[death]] he is avoiding. for he submits to some part of [[death]], for the very [[purpose]] of avoiding the whole, and the second and eternal [[death]] over and above. he submits to the separation of [[soul]] and [[body]], lest the [[soul]] be separated both from [[god]] and from the [[body]], and so the whole first [[death]] be completed, and the second [[death]] receive him everlastingly. wherefore [[death]] is indeed, as i said, [[good]] to none while it is being actually [[suffered]], and while it is subduing the dying to its [[power]]; but it is meritoriously endured for the sake of retaining or winning what is [[good]]. and regarding what happens after [[death]], it is no absurdity to say that [[death]] is [[good]] to the [[good]], and [[evil]] to the [[evil]]. for the disembodied spirits of the just are at rest; but those of the wicked suffer [[punishment]] till their bodies [[body]] rise again,—those of the just to [[life]] everlasting, and of the others to [[death]] eternal, which is called the second [[death]].

9. whether we should say that the moment of [[death]], in which sensation ceases, occurs in the [[experience]] of the dying or in that of the [[dead]].

the point of [[time]] in which the souls [[soul]] of the [[good]] and [[evil]] are separated from the [[body]], are we to say it is after [[death]], or in [[death]] rather? if it is after [[death]], then it is not [[death]] which is [[good]] or [[evil]], since [[death]] is done with and [[past]], but[pg 529] it is the [[life]] which the [[soul]] has now entered on. [[death]] was an [[evil]] when it was [[present]], that is to say, when it was being [[suffered]] by the dying; for to them it brought with it a severe and grievous [[experience]], which the [[good]] make a [[good]] use of. but when [[death]] is [[past]], how can that which no longer is be either [[good]] or [[evil]]? still further, if we examine the matter more closely, we shall see that even that sore and grievous [[pain]] which the dying [[experience]] is not [[death]] itself. for so long as they have any sensation, they are certainly still alive; and, if still alive, must rather be said to be in a [[state]] previous to [[death]] than in [[death]]. for when [[death]] actually comes, it robs us of all bodily sensation, which, while [[death]] is only approaching, is painful. and thus it is difficult to explain how we speak of those who are not yet [[dead]], but are agonized in their [[last]] and mortal extremity, as being in the article of [[death]]. yet what else can we call them than dying persons [[person]]? for when [[death]] which was imminent shall have actually come, we can no longer call them dying but [[dead]]. no one, therefore, is dying unless living; since even he who is in the [[last]] extremity of [[life]], and, as we say, giving up the ghost, yet lives [[life]]. the same [[person]] is therefore at once dying and living, but drawing near to [[death]], departing from [[life]]; yet in [[life]], because his spirit yet abides in the [[body]]; not yet in [[death]], because not yet has his spirit forsaken the [[body]]. but if, when it has forsaken it, the [[man]] is not even then in [[death]], but after [[death]], who shall say when he is in [[death]]? on the one hand, no one can be called dying, if a [[man]] cannot be dying and living at the same [[time]]; and as long as the [[soul]] is in the [[body]], we cannot deny that he is living. on the other hand, if the [[man]] who is approaching [[death]] be rather called dying, i [[know]] not who is living.

10. of the [[life]] of mortals, which is rather to be called [[death]] than [[life]].

for no sooner do we begin to [[live]] in this dying [[body]], than we begin to move ceaselessly towards [[death]].[585] for in the[pg 530] whole course of this [[life]] (if [[life]] we must call it) its mutability tends towards [[death]]. certainly there is no one who is not nearer it this year than [[last]] year, and to-morrow than to-day, and to-day than yesterday, and a short while hence than now, and now than a short while ago. for whatever [[time]] we [[live]] is deducted from our whole term of [[life]], and that which remains is daily becoming less and less; so that our whole [[life]] is nothing but a [[race]] towards [[death]], in which no one is allowed to stand still for a little space, or to go somewhat more slowly, but all are driven forwards with an [[impartial]] movement, and with [[equal]] rapidity. for he whose [[life]] is short spends a day no more swiftly than he whose [[life]] is longer. but while the [[equal]] moments are impartially snatched from both, the one has a nearer and the other a more remote goal to reach with this their [[equal]] speed. it is one thing to make a longer [[journey]], and another to walk more slowly. he, therefore, who spends longer [[time]] on his way to [[death]] does not proceed at a more leisurely pace, but goes over more ground. further, if every [[man]] begins to [[die]], that is, is in [[death]], as soon as [[death]] has begun to show itself in him (by taking away [[life]], to wit; for when [[life]] is all taken away, the [[man]] will be then not in [[death]], but after death), then he begins to [[die]] so soon as he begins to [[live]]. for what else is going on in all his days, hours, and moments, until this slow-working [[death]] is fully consummated? and then comes the [[time]] after [[death]], instead of that in which [[life]] was being withdrawn, and which we called being in [[death]]. [[man]], then, is never in [[life]] from the moment he dwells in this dying rather than living [[body]],—if, at least, he cannot be in [[life]] and [[death]] at once. or rather, shall we say, he is in both?—in [[life]], namely, which he lives [[life]] till all is consumed; but in [[death]] also, which he dies as his [[life]] is consumed? for if he is not in [[life]], what is it which is consumed till all be gone? and if he is not in [[death]], what is this consumption itself? for when the whole of [[life]] has been consumed, the expression "after death" would be meaningless, had that consumption not been [[death]]. and if, when it has all been consumed, a [[man]] is not in [[death]] but after [[death]], when is he in [[death]], unless when [[life]] is being consumed away?

[pg 531]

11. whether one can both be living and [[dead]] at the same [[time]].

but if it is absurd to say that a [[man]] is in [[death]] before he reaches [[death]] (for to what is his course running as he passes through [[life]], if already he is in [[death]]?), and if it outrage [[common]] usage to speak of a [[man]] being at once alive and [[dead]], as much as it does so, to speak of him as at once asleep and awake, it remains to be [[asked]] when a [[man]] is dying? for, before [[death]] comes, he is not dying but living; and when [[death]] has come, he is not dying but [[dead]]. the one is before, the other after [[death]]. when, then, is he in [[death]] so that we can say he is dying? for as there are three times [[time]], before [[death]], in [[death]], after [[death]], so there are three states corresponding, living, dying, [[dead]]. and it is very hard to define when a [[man]] is in [[death]] or dying, when he is neither living, which is before [[death]], nor [[dead]], which is after [[death]], but dying, which is in [[death]]. for so long as the [[soul]] is in the [[body]], especially if [[consciousness]] remain, the [[man]] certainly lives [[life]]; for [[body]] and [[soul]] constitute the [[man]]. and thus, before [[death]], he cannot be said to be in [[death]]; but when, on the other hand, the [[soul]] has departed, and all bodily sensation is extinct, [[death]] is [[past]], and the [[man]] is [[dead]]. between these two states the dying condition finds no place; for if a [[man]] yet lives [[life]], [[death]] has not arrived; if he has ceased to [[live]], [[death]] is [[past]]. never, then, is he dying, that is, comprehended in the [[state]] of [[death]]. so also in the passing of [[time]],—you try to lay your finger on the [[present]], and cannot find it, because the [[present]] occupies no space, but is only the transition of [[time]] from the future to the [[past]]. must we then conclude that there is thus no [[death]] of the [[body]] at all? for if there is, where is it, since it is in no one, and no one can be in it? since, indeed, if there is yet [[life]], [[death]] is not yet; for this [[state]] is before [[death]], not in [[death]]: and if [[life]] has already ceased, [[death]] is not [[present]]; for this [[state]] is after [[death]], not in [[death]]. on the other hand, if there is no [[death]] before or after, what do we mean when we say "after [[death]]," or "before [[death]]?" this is a foolish way of speaking if there is no [[death]]. and would that we had lived so well in paradise that in very [[truth]] there were now no death! but not only does it now [[exist]], but so grievous[pg 532] a thing is it, that no [[skill]] is sufficient either to explain or to escape it.

let us, then, speak in the customary way,—no [[man]] ought to speak otherwise,—and let us call the [[time]] before [[death]] come, "before [[death]];" as it is written, "praise no [[man]] before his [[death]]."[586] and when it has happened, let us say that "after death" this or that took place. and of the [[present]] [[time]] let us speak as [[best]] we can, as when we say, "he, when dying, made his will, and left this or that to such and such persons [[person]],"—though, of course, he could not do so unless he were living, and did this rather before [[death]] than in [[death]]. and let us use the same phraseology as [[scripture]] uses; for it makes no scruple of saying that the [[dead]] are not after but in [[death]]. so that verse, "for in [[death]] there is no remembrance of thee."[587] for until the resurrection [[men]] are justly said to be in [[death]]; as every one is said to be in sleep till he awakes. however, though we can say of persons [[person]] in sleep that they are sleeping, we cannot speak in this way of the [[dead]], and say they are dying. for, so far as regards the [[death]] of the [[body]], of which we are now speaking, one cannot say that those who are already separated from their bodies [[body]] continue dying. but this, you see, is just what i was saying,—that no words can explain how either the dying are said to [[live]], or how the [[dead]] are said, even after [[death]], to be in [[death]]. for how can they be after [[death]] if they be in [[death]], especially when we do not even call them dying, as we call those in sleep, sleeping; and those in languor, languishing; and those in [[grief]], grieving; and those in [[life]], living? and yet the [[dead]], until they rise again, are said to be in [[death]], but cannot be called dying.

and therefore i [[think]] it has not unsuitably nor inappropriately come to pass, though not by the intention of [[man]], yet perhaps with [[divine]] [[purpose]], that this latin word moritur cannot be declined by the grammarians according to the [[rule]] followed by similar words. for oritur gives the form ortus est for the [[perfect]]; and all similar verbs form this tense from their [[perfect]] participles. but if we ask the [[perfect]] of moritur, we get the regular [[answer]], mortuus[pg 533] est with a double u. for thus mortuus is pronounced, like fatuus, arduus, conspicuus, and similar words, which are not [[perfect]] participles but adjectives, and are declined without regard to tense. but mortuus, though in form an adjective, is used as [[perfect]] participle, as if that were to be declined which cannot be declined; and thus it has suitably come to pass that, as the thing itself cannot in point of [[fact]] be declined, so neither can the word significant of the act be declined. yet, by the aid of our redeemer's grace, we may manage at least to decline the second. for that is more grievous still, and, indeed, of all evils [[evil]] the worst, since it consists not in the separation of [[soul]] and [[body]], but in the uniting of both in [[death]] eternal. and there, in striking contrast to our [[present]] conditions, [[men]] will not be before or after [[death]], but always in [[death]]; and thus never living, never [[dead]], but endlessly dying. and never can a [[man]] be more disastrously in [[death]] than when [[death]] itself shall be deathless.

12. what [[death]] [[god]] intended, when he threatened our first parents with [[death]] if they should disobey his commandment.

when, therefore, it is [[asked]] what [[death]] it was with which [[god]] threatened our first parents if they should transgress the commandment they had received from him, and should fail to preserve their [[obedience]],—whether it was the [[death]] of [[soul]], or of [[body]], or of the whole [[man]], or that which is called second [[death]],—we must [[answer]], it is all. for the first consists of two; the second is the complete [[death]], which consists of all. for, as the whole [[earth]] consists of many lands [[land]], and the [[church]] universal of many churches [[church]], so [[death]] universal consists of all deaths [[death]]. the first consists of two, one of the [[body]], and another of the [[soul]]. so that the first [[death]] is a [[death]] of the whole [[man]], since the [[soul]] without [[god]] and without the [[body]] suffers [[punishment]] for a [[time]]; but the second is when the [[soul]], without [[god]] but with the [[body]], suffers [[punishment]] everlasting. when, therefore, [[god]] said to that first [[man]] whom he had placed in paradise, referring to the forbidden fruit, "in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely [[die]],"[588] that threatening included not only the first part of the first [[death]], by which the [[soul]] is[pg 534] deprived of [[god]]; nor only the subsequent part of the first [[death]], by which the [[body]] is deprived of the [[soul]]; nor only the whole first [[death]] itself, by which the [[soul]] is punished in separation from [[god]] and from the [[body]];—but it includes whatever of [[death]] there is, even to that final [[death]] which is called second, and to which none is subsequent.

13. what was the first [[punishment]] of the transgression of our first parents?

for, as soon as our first parents had transgressed the commandment, [[divine]] grace forsook them, and they were confounded at their own wickedness; and therefore they took fig-leaves (which were possibly the first that came to hand in their troubled [[state]] of mind), and covered their shame; for though their members remained the same, they had shame now where they had none before. they experienced a new motion of their flesh, which had become disobedient to them, in strict retribution of their own disobedience to [[god]]. for the [[soul]], revelling in its own [[liberty]], and scorning to serve [[god]], was itself deprived of the command it had formerly maintained over the [[body]]. and because it had wilfully deserted its superior [[lord]], it no longer held its own inferior servant; neither could it hold the flesh [[subject]], as it would always have been able to do had it remained itself [[subject]] to [[god]]. then began the flesh to [[lust]] against the spirit,[589] in which strife we are born, deriving from the first transgression a seed of [[death]], and bearing in our members, and in our vitiated [[nature]], the contest or even [[victory]] of the flesh.

14. in what [[state]] [[man]] was made by [[god]], and into what estate he fell by the [[choice]] of his own will.

for [[god]], the author of natures [[nature]], not of vices [[vice]], created [[man]] upright; but [[man]], being of his own will corrupted, and justly condemned, begot corrupted and condemned [[children]]. for we all were in that one [[man]], since we all were that one [[man]] who fell into [[sin]] by the woman who was made from him before the [[sin]]. for not yet was the particular form created and distributed to us, in which we as individuals [[individual]] were to [[live]], but already the seminal [[nature]] was there from which[pg 535] we were to be propagated; and this being vitiated by [[sin]], and bound by the chain of [[death]], and justly condemned, [[man]] could not be born of [[man]] in any other [[state]]. and thus, from the [[bad]] use of [[free]] will, there originated the whole train of [[evil]], which, with its concatenation of miseries, convoys the [[human]] [[race]] from its depraved origin, as from a [[corrupt]] root, on to the destruction of the second [[death]], which has no end, those only being excepted who are freed by the grace of [[god]].

15. that adam in his [[sin]] forsook [[god]] ere [[god]] forsook him, and that his falling away from [[god]] was the first [[death]] of the [[soul]].

it may perhaps be supposed that because [[god]] said, "ye shall [[die]] the [[death]],"[590] and not "deaths," we should [[understand]] only that [[death]] which occurs when the [[soul]] is deserted by [[god]], who is its [[life]]; for it was not deserted by [[god]], and so deserted him, but deserted him, and so was deserted by him. for its own will was the originator of its [[evil]], as [[god]] was the originator of its motions towards [[good]], both in making it when it was not, and in re-making it when it had fallen and perished. but though we suppose that [[god]] meant only this. [[death]], and that the words, "in the day ye [[eat]] of it ye shall [[die]] the [[death]]," should be understood as meaning, "in the day ye desert me in disobedience, i will desert you in [[justice]]," yet assuredly in this [[death]] the other deaths [[death]] also were threatened, which were its inevitable consequence. for in the first stirring of the disobedient motion which was [[felt]] in the flesh of the disobedient [[soul]], and which caused our first parents to cover their shame, one [[death]] indeed is experienced, that, namely, which occurs when [[god]] forsakes the [[soul]]. (this was intimated by the words he uttered, when the [[man]], stupefied by [[fear]], had hid himself, "adam, where art [[arts]] thou?"[591]—words which he used not in ignorance of inquiry, but warning him to consider where he was, since [[god]] was not with him.) but when the [[soul]] itself forsook the [[body]], corrupted and decayed with [[age]], the other [[death]] was experienced of which [[god]] had spoken in pronouncing man's [[man]] sentence, "earth thou art [[arts]], and unto [[earth]] shalt thou return."[592] and of these two deaths [[death]] that first [[death]] of the whole [[man]] is composed. and this first death[pg 536] is finally followed by the second, unless [[man]] be freed by grace. for the [[body]] would not return to the [[earth]] from which it was made, save only by the [[death]] proper to itself, which occurs when it is forsaken of the [[soul]], its [[life]]. and therefore it is agreed among all christians [[christian]] who truthfully hold the catholic [[faith]], that we are [[subject]] to the [[death]] of the [[body]], not by the [[law]] of [[nature]], by which [[god]] ordained no [[death]] for [[man]], but by his righteous infliction on account of [[sin]]; for [[god]], taking vengeance on [[sin]], said to the [[man]], in whom we all then were, "dust thou art [[arts]], and unto dust shalt thou return."

16. concerning the [[philosophers]] who [[think]] that the separation of [[soul]] and [[body]] is not penal, though [[plato]] represents the supreme deity as promising to the inferior gods that they shall never be dismissed from their bodies [[body]].

but the [[philosophers]] against whom we are defending the [[city]] of [[god]], that is, his [[church]], seem to themselves to have [[good]] cause to deride us, because we say that the separation of the [[soul]] from the [[body]] is to be held as part of man's [[man]] [[punishment]]. for they suppose that the blessedness of the [[soul]] then only is complete, when it is quite denuded of the [[body]], and returns to [[god]] a pure and simple, and, as it were, naked [[soul]]. on this point, if i should find nothing in their own literature to refute this [[opinion]], i should be forced laboriously to demonstrate that it is not the [[body]], but the corruptibility of the [[body]], which is a burden to the [[soul]]. hence that sentence of [[scripture]] we quoted in a foregoing [[book]], "for the corruptible [[body]] presseth down the [[soul]]."[593] the word corruptible is added to show that the [[soul]] is burdened, not by any [[body]] whatsoever, but by the [[body]] such as it has become in consequence of [[sin]]. and even though the word had not been added, we could [[understand]] nothing else. but when [[plato]] most expressly declares that the gods who are made by the supreme have [[immortal]] bodies [[body]], and when he introduces their maker himself promising them as a [[great]] boon that they should abide in their bodies [[body]] eternally, and never by any [[death]] be loosed from them, why do these adversaries of ours, for the sake of troubling the [[christian]] [[faith]], feign to be ignorant of what they quite well [[know]], and even prefer to contradict themselves rather than lose an opportunity of contradicting us? here are plato's words, as cicero[pg 537] has translated them,[594] in which he introduces the supreme addressing the gods he had made, and saying, "ye who are sprung from a [[divine]] stock, consider of what works [[work]] i am the parent and author. these (your bodies) are indestructible so long as i will it; although all that is composed can be destroyed. but it is wicked to dissolve what [[reason]] has compacted. but, seeing that ye have been born, ye cannot indeed be [[immortal]] and indestructible; yet ye shall by no means be destroyed, nor shall any fates [[fate]] consign you to [[death]], and prove superior to my will, which is a stronger assurance of your perpetuity than those bodies [[body]] to which ye were joined when ye were born." [[plato]], you see, says that the gods are both mortal by the connection of the [[body]] and [[soul]], and yet are rendered [[immortal]] by the will and decree of their maker. if, therefore, it is a [[punishment]] to the [[soul]] to be connected with any [[body]] whatever, why does [[god]] address them as if they were afraid of [[death]], that is, of the separation of [[soul]] and [[body]]? why does he seek to reassure them by promising them immortality, not in [[virtue]] of their [[nature]], which is composite and not simple, but by [[virtue]] of his invincible will, whereby he can effect that neither things born [[die]], nor things compounded be dissolved, but preserved eternally?

whether this [[opinion]] of plato's about the stars is true or not, is another [[question]]. for we cannot at once grant to him that these luminous bodies [[body]] or globes, which by day and night shine on the [[earth]] with the [[light]] of their bodily substance, have also intellectual and blessed souls [[soul]] which animate each its own [[body]], as he confidently affirms of the [[universe]] itself, as if it were one huge animal, in which all other animals were contained.[595] but this, as i said, is another [[question]], which we[pg 538] have not undertaken to discuss at [[present]]. this much only i deemed [[right]] to bring forward, in opposition to those who so [[pride]] themselves on being, or on being called platonists, that they blush to be christians [[christian]], and who cannot brook to be called by a name which the [[common]] [[people]] also bear, lest they vulgarize the philosophers' coterie, which is proud in proportion to its exclusiveness. these [[men]], seeking a [[weak]] point in the [[christian]] doctrine, select for attack the eternity of the [[body]], as if it were a contradiction to contend for the blessedness of the [[soul]], and to [[wish]] it to be always resident in the [[body]], bound, as it were, in a lamentable chain; and this although [[plato]], their own founder and master, affirms that it was granted by the supreme as a boon to the gods he had made, that they should not [[die]], that is, should not be separated from the bodies [[body]] with which he had connected them.

17. against those who affirm that earthly bodies [[body]] cannot be made incorruptible and eternal.

these same [[philosophers]] further contend that terrestrial bodies [[body]] cannot be eternal, though they make no [[doubt]] that the whole [[earth]], which is itself the central member of their [[god]],—not, indeed, of the [[greatest]], but yet of a [[great]] [[god]], that is, of this whole [[world]],—is eternal. since, then, the supreme made for them another [[god]], that is, this [[world]], superior to the other gods beneath him; and since they suppose that this [[god]] is an animal, having, as they affirm, a [[rational]] or intellectual [[soul]] enclosed in the huge mass of its [[body]], and having, as the fitly situated and adjusted members of its [[body]], the four elements, whose union they [[wish]] to be indissoluble and eternal, lest perchance this [[great]] [[god]] of theirs might some day perish; what [[reason]] is there that the [[earth]], which is the central member in the [[body]] of a greater creature, should be eternal, and the bodies [[body]] of other terrestrial creatures should not possibly be eternal if [[god]] should so will it? but [[earth]], say they, must return to [[earth]], out of which the terrestrial bodies [[body]] of the animals have been taken. for this, they say, is the [[reason]] of the necessity of their [[death]] and dissolution, and this the manner of their restoration to the solid and eternal [[earth]] whence they came. but if any one says the same thing of [[fire]], holding that the bodies [[body]] which are derived from it to make[pg 539] celestial beings must be restored to the universal [[fire]], does not the immortality which [[plato]] represents these gods as receiving from the supreme evanesce in the heat of this dispute? or does this not happen with those celestials because [[god]], whose will, as [[plato]] says, overpowers all powers [[power]], has willed it should not be so? what, then, hinders [[god]] from ordaining the same of terrestrial bodies [[body]]? and since, indeed, [[plato]] acknowledges that [[god]] can prevent things that are born from dying, and things that are joined from being sundered, and things that are composed from being dissolved, and can ordain that the souls [[soul]] once allotted to their bodies [[body]] should never abandon them, but enjoy along with them immortality and everlasting bliss, why may he not also effect that terrestrial bodies [[body]] [[die]] not? is [[god]] powerless to do everything that is special to the christian's creed, but powerful to effect everything the platonists [[desire]]? the [[philosophers]], forsooth, have been admitted to a [[knowledge]] of the [[divine]] purposes [[purpose]] and [[power]] which has been denied to the prophets! the [[truth]] is, that the spirit of [[god]] taught his prophets [[prophet]] so much of his will as he [[thought]] fit to reveal, but the [[philosophers]], in their efforts to discover it, were deceived by [[human]] conjecture.

but they should not have been so [[led]] astray, i will not say by their ignorance, but by their obstinacy, as to contradict themselves so frequently; for they maintain, with all their vaunted might, that in order to the [[happiness]] of the [[soul]], it must abandon not only its earthly [[body]], but every [[kind]] of [[body]]. and yet they hold that the gods, whose souls [[soul]] are most blessed, are bound to everlasting bodies [[body]], the celestials to fiery bodies [[body]], and the [[soul]] of jove himself (or this [[world]], as they would have us believe) to all the physical elements which compose this entire mass reaching from [[earth]] to [[heaven]]. for this [[soul]] [[plato]] believes [[belief]] to be extended and diffused by musical numbers,[596] from the middle of the inside of the [[earth]], which geometricians call the centre, outwards through all its parts to the utmost heights and extremities of the heavens [[heaven]]; so that this [[world]] is a very [[great]] and blessed [[immortal]] animal, whose [[soul]] has both the [[perfect]] blessedness of [[wisdom]], and never leaves its own [[body]], and whose [[body]] has [[life]] everlasting[pg 540] from the [[soul]], and by no means clogs or hinders it, though itself be not a simple [[body]], but compacted of so many and so huge materials. since, therefore, they allow so much to their own conjectures, why do they refuse to [[believe]] that by the [[divine]] will and [[power]] immortality can be conferred on earthly bodies [[body]], in which the souls [[soul]] would be neither [[oppressed]] with the burden of them, nor separated from them by any [[death]], but [[live]] eternally and blessedly? do they not assert that their own gods so [[live]] in bodies [[body]] of [[fire]], and that jove himself, their [[king]], so lives [[life]] in the physical elements? if, in order to its blessedness, the [[soul]] must quit every [[kind]] of [[body]], let their gods flit from the starry spheres, and [[jupiter]] from [[earth]] to [[sky]]; or, if they cannot do so, let them be pronounced miserable. but neither alternative will these [[men]] adopt. for, on the one hand, they dare not ascribe to their own gods a departure from the [[body]], lest they should seem to [[worship]] mortals; on the other hand, they dare not deny their [[happiness]], lest they should acknowledge wretches as gods. therefore, to obtain blessedness, we need not quit every [[kind]] of [[body]], but only the corruptible, cumbersome, painful, dying,—not such bodies [[body]] as the goodness of [[god]] contrived for the first [[man]], but such only as man's [[man]] [[sin]] entailed.

18. of earthly bodies [[body]], which the [[philosophers]] affirm cannot be in heavenly places, because whatever is of [[earth]] is by its [[natural]] weight attracted to [[earth]].

but it is necessary, they say, that the [[natural]] weight of earthly bodies [[body]] either keep them on [[earth]] or draw them to it; and therefore they cannot be in [[heaven]]. our first parents were indeed on [[earth]], in a well-wooded and fruitful spot, which has been named paradise. but let our adversaries a little more carefully consider this [[subject]] of earthly weight, because it has important bearings, both on the ascension of the [[body]] of [[christ]], and also on the resurrection [[body]] of the saints. if [[human]] [[skill]] can by some contrivance fabricate vessels that float, out of metals which sink as soon as they are placed on the water, how much more credible is it that [[god]], by some occult mode of operation, should even more certainly effect that these earthy masses be emancipated from the downward pressure of their weight? this cannot be impossible to that [[god]] by whose almighty will, according to[pg 541] [[plato]], neither things born perish, nor things composed dissolve, especially since it is much more wonderful that [[spiritual]] and bodily essences be conjoined than that bodies [[body]] be adjusted to other material substances. can we not also easily [[believe]] that souls [[soul]], being made perfectly blessed, should be endowed with the [[power]] of moving their earthy but incorruptible bodies [[body]] as they please, with almost spontaneous movement, and of placing them where they please with the readiest action? if the angels transport whatever terrestrial creatures they please from any place they please, and convey them whither they please, is it to be believed that they cannot do so without toil and the feeling of burden? why, then, may we not [[believe]] that the spirits of the saints, made [[perfect]] and blessed by [[divine]] grace, can carry their own bodies [[body]] where they please, and set them where they will? for, though we have been accustomed to notice, in bearing weights, that the larger the quantity the greater the weight of earthy bodies [[body]] is, and that the greater the weight the more burdensome it is, yet the [[soul]] carries the members of its own flesh with less difficulty when they are massive with health, than in sickness when they are wasted. and though the hale and [[strong]] [[man]] feels [[feel]] heavier to other [[men]] carrying him than the lank and sickly, yet the [[man]] himself moves and carries his own [[body]] with less feeling of burden when he has the greater bulk of vigorous health, than when his frame is reduced to a minimum by [[hunger]] or disease. of such consequence, in estimating the weight of earthly bodies [[body]], even while yet corruptible and mortal, is the consideration not of [[dead]] weight, but of the healthy equilibrium of the parts. and what words can tell the difference between what we now call health and future immortality? let not the [[philosophers]], then, [[think]] to upset our [[faith]] with arguments from the weight of bodies [[body]]; for i don't [[care]] to inquire why they cannot [[believe]] an earthly [[body]] can be in [[heaven]], while the whole [[earth]] is suspended on nothing. for perhaps the [[world]] keeps its central place by the same [[law]] that attracts to its centre all heavy bodies [[body]]. but this i say, if the lesser gods, to whom [[plato]] committed the creation of [[man]] and the other terrestrial creatures, were able, as he affirms, to withdraw from the [[fire]] its quality of burning, while[pg 542] they left it that of lighting, so that it should shine through the [[eyes]]; and if to the supreme [[god]] [[plato]] also concedes the [[power]] of preserving from [[death]] things that have been born, and of preserving from dissolution things that are composed of parts so different as [[body]] and spirit;—are we to hesitate to concede to this same [[god]] the [[power]] to operate on the flesh of him whom he has endowed with immortality, so as to withdraw its [[corruption]] but leave its [[nature]], remove its burdensome weight but retain its seemly form and members? but concerning our [[belief]] in the resurrection of the [[dead]], and concerning their [[immortal]] bodies [[body]], we shall speak more at large, [[god]] willing, in the end of this [[work]].

19. against the [[opinion]] of those who do not [[believe]] that the primitive [[men]] would have been [[immortal]] if they had not sinned.

at [[present]] let us go on, as we have begun, to give some explanation regarding the bodies [[body]] of our first parents. i say then, that, except as the just consequence of [[sin]], they would not have been subjected even to this [[death]], which is [[good]] to the [[good]],—this [[death]], which is not exclusively known and believed in by a few, but is known to all, by which [[soul]] and [[body]] are separated, and by which the [[body]] of an animal which was but now visibly living is now visibly [[dead]]. for though there can be no manner of [[doubt]] that the souls [[soul]] of the just and holy [[dead]] [[live]] in peaceful rest, yet so much [[better]] would it be for them to be alive in healthy, well-conditioned bodies [[body]], that even those who hold the tenet that it is most blessed to be quit of every [[kind]] of [[body]], condemn this [[opinion]] in spite of themselves. for no one will dare to set [[wise]] [[men]], whether yet to [[die]] or already [[dead]],—in other words, whether already quit of the [[body]], or shortly to be so,—above the [[immortal]] gods, to whom the supreme, in [[plato]], promises as a munificent gift [[life]] indissoluble, or in eternal union with their bodies [[body]]. but this same [[plato]] thinks [[think]] that nothing [[better]] can happen to [[men]] than that they pass through [[life]] piously and justly, and, being separated from their bodies [[body]], be received into the bosom of the gods, who never abandon theirs; "that, oblivious of the [[past]], they may revisit the upper air, and conceive the longing to return again to the [[body]]."[597] virgil[pg 543] is applauded for borrowing this from the platonic [[system]]. assuredly [[plato]] thinks [[think]] that the souls [[soul]] of mortals cannot always be in their bodies [[body]], but must necessarily be dismissed by [[death]]; and, on the other hand, he thinks [[think]] that without bodies [[body]] they cannot endure for ever, but with ceaseless alternation pass from [[life]] to [[death]], and from [[death]] to [[life]]. this difference, however, he sets between [[wise]] [[men]] and the rest, that they are carried after [[death]] to the stars, that each [[man]] may repose for a while in a star suitable for him, and may thence return to the labours [[labour]] and miseries of mortals when he has become oblivious of his former misery, and possessed with the [[desire]] of being embodied. those, again, who have lived foolishly transmigrate into bodies [[body]] fit for them, whether [[human]] or bestial. thus he has appointed even the [[good]] and [[wise]] souls [[soul]] to a very hard lot indeed, since they do not receive such bodies [[body]] as they might always and even immortally inhabit, but such only as they can neither permanently retain nor enjoy eternal purity without. of this notion of plato's, we have in a former [[book]] already said[598] that porphyry was ashamed in the [[light]] of these [[christian]] times [[time]], so that he not only emancipated [[human]] souls [[soul]] from a [[destiny]] in the bodies [[body]] of beasts, but also contended for the liberation of the souls [[soul]] of the [[wise]] from all bodily ties, so that, escaping from all flesh, they might, as bare and blessed souls [[soul]], dwell with the [[father]] [[time]] without end. and that he might not seem to be outbid by christ's promise of [[life]] everlasting to his saints, he also established purified souls [[soul]] in endless felicity, without return to their former woes; but, that he might contradict [[christ]], he denies the resurrection of incorruptible bodies [[body]], and maintains that these souls [[soul]] will [[live]] eternally, not only without earthly bodies [[body]], but without any bodies [[body]] at all. and yet, whatever he meant by this teaching, he at least did not [[teach]] that these souls [[soul]] should offer no [[religious]] observance to the gods who dwelt in bodies [[body]]. and why did he not, unless because he did not [[believe]] that the souls [[soul]], even though separate from the [[body]], were superior to those gods? wherefore, if these [[philosophers]] will not dare (as i [[think]] they will not) to set [[human]] souls [[soul]] above the gods who are most blessed, and yet are tied eternally[pg 544] to their bodies [[body]], why do they find that absurd which the [[christian]] [[faith]] preaches,[599] namely, that our first parents were so created that, if they had not sinned, they would not have been dismissed from their bodies [[body]] by any [[death]], but would have been endowed with immortality as the [[reward]] of their [[obedience]], and would have lived eternally with their bodies [[body]]; and further, that the saints will in the resurrection inhabit those very bodies [[body]] in which they have here toiled, but in such sort that neither shall any [[corruption]] or unwieldiness be [[suffered]] to attach to their flesh, nor any [[grief]] or trouble to cloud their felicity?

20. that the flesh now resting in [[peace]] shall be raised to a [[perfection]] not enjoyed by the flesh of our first parents.

thus the souls [[soul]] of departed saints are not affected by the [[death]] which dismisses them from their bodies [[body]], because their flesh rests in [[hope]], no matter what indignities it receives after sensation is gone. for they do not [[desire]] that their bodies [[body]] be forgotten, as [[plato]] thinks [[think]] fit, but rather, because they [[remember]] what has been promised by him who deceives no [[man]], and who gave them security for the safe keeping even of the hairs of their head, they with a longing patience wait in [[hope]] of the resurrection of their bodies [[body]], in which they have [[suffered]] many hardships, and are now to suffer never again. for if they did not "hate their own flesh," when it, with its native infirmity, opposed their will, and had to be constrained by the [[spiritual]] [[law]], how much more shall they [[love]] it, when it shall even itself have become spiritual! for as, when the spirit serves the flesh, it is fitly called carnal, so, when the flesh serves the spirit, it will justly be called [[spiritual]]. not that it is converted into spirit, as some fancy from the words, "it is sown in [[corruption]], it is raised in incorruption,"[600] but because it is [[subject]] to the spirit with a [[perfect]] and marvellous readiness of [[obedience]], and responds in all things to the will that has entered on immortality,—all reluctance, all [[corruption]], and all slowness being removed. for the [[body]] will not only be [[better]] than it was here in its [[best]] estate of health, but it will surpass the[pg 545] bodies [[body]] of our first parents ere they sinned. for, though they were not to [[die]] unless they should [[sin]], yet they used food as [[men]] do now, their bodies [[body]] not being as yet [[spiritual]], but animal only. and though they decayed not with years, nor drew nearer to [[death]],—a condition secured to them in god's marvellous grace by the tree of [[life]], which grew along with the forbidden tree in the midst of paradise,—yet they took other nourishment, though not of that one tree, which was interdicted not because it was itself [[bad]], but for the sake of commending a pure and simple [[obedience]], which is the [[great]] [[virtue]] of the [[rational]] creature set under the creator as his [[lord]]. for, though no [[evil]] thing was touched, yet if a thing forbidden was touched, the very disobedience was [[sin]]. they were, then, nourished by other fruit, which they took that their animal bodies [[body]] might not suffer the discomfort of [[hunger]] or thirst; but they tasted the tree of [[life]], that [[death]] might not steal upon them from any quarter, and that they might not, spent with [[age]], decay. other fruits were, so to speak, their nourishment, but this their sacrament. so that the tree of [[life]] would seem to have been in the terrestrial paradise what the [[wisdom]] of [[god]] is in the [[spiritual]], of which it is written, "she is a tree of [[life]] to them that lay hold upon her."[601]

21. of paradise, that it can be understood in a [[spiritual]] sense without sacrificing the historic [[truth]] of the narrative regarding the real place.

on this account some allegorize all that concerns paradise itself, where the first [[men]], the parents of the [[human]] [[race]], are, according to the [[truth]] of holy [[scripture]], recorded to have been; and they [[understand]] all its trees and fruit-bearing plants as virtues [[virtue]] and habits of [[life]], as if they had no existence in the external [[world]], but were only so spoken of or related for the sake of [[spiritual]] meanings. as if there could not be a real terrestrial paradise! as if there never existed these two [[women]], sarah and hagar, nor the two sons [[son]] who were born to [[abraham]], the one of the bond woman, the other of the [[free]], because the apostle says that in them the two covenants were prefigured; or as if water never flowed from the rock when [[moses]] struck it, because therein [[christ]] can be seen in a figure, as the same apostle says, "now that rock was christ!"[602] no[pg 546] one, then, denies that paradise may signify the [[life]] of the blessed; its four rivers, the four virtues [[virtue]], prudence, fortitude, temperance, and [[justice]]; its trees, all useful [[knowledge]]; its fruits, the customs of the godly; its tree of [[life]], [[wisdom]] herself, the [[mother]] of all [[good]]; and the tree of the [[knowledge]] of [[good]] and [[evil]], the [[experience]] of a broken commandment. the [[punishment]] which [[god]] appointed was in itself a just, and therefore a [[good]] thing; but man's [[man]] [[experience]] of it is not [[good]].

these things can also and more profitably be understood of the [[church]], so that they become prophetic foreshadowings of things to come. thus paradise is the [[church]], as it is called in the canticles;[603] the four rivers of paradise are the four gospels; the fruit-trees the saints, and the fruit their works [[work]]; the tree of [[life]] is the holy of holies, [[christ]]; the tree of the [[knowledge]] of [[good]] and [[evil]], the will's [[free]] [[choice]]. for if [[man]] despise the will of [[god]], he can only [[destroy]] himself; and so he learns the difference between consecrating himself to the [[common]] [[good]] and revelling in his own. for he who loves [[love]] himself is abandoned to himself, in order that, being overwhelmed with fears [[fear]] and sorrows [[sorrow]], he may cry, if there be yet [[soul]] in him to [[feel]] his ills, in the words of the psalm, "my [[soul]] is cast down within me,"[604] and when chastened, may say, "because of his [[strength]] i will wait upon thee."[605] these and similar allegorical interpretations may be suitably put upon paradise without giving offence to any one, while yet we [[believe]] the strict [[truth]] of the [[history]], confirmed by its circumstantial narrative of facts [[fact]].[606]

22. that the bodies [[body]] of the saints shall after the resurrection be [[spiritual]], and yet flesh shall not be changed into spirit.

the bodies [[body]] of the righteous, then, such as they shall be in the resurrection, shall need neither any fruit to preserve them from dying of disease or the wasting decay of old [[age]], nor any other physical nourishment to allay the cravings of [[hunger]] or of thirst; for they shall be invested with so sure and every[pg 547] way inviolable an immortality, that they shall not [[eat]] save when they choose, nor be under the necessity of eating, while they enjoy the [[power]] of doing so. for so also was it with the angels who presented themselves to the eye and touch of [[men]], not because they could do no otherwise, but because they were able and desirous to suit themselves to [[men]] by a [[kind]] of manhood ministry. for neither are we to suppose, when [[men]] receive them as guests, that the angels [[eat]] only in appearance, though to any who did not [[know]] them to be angels they might seem to [[eat]] from the same necessity as ourselves. so these words spoken in the [[book]] of tobit, "you saw me [[eat]], but you saw it but in vision;"[607] that is, you [[thought]] i took food as you do for the sake of refreshing my [[body]]. but if in the case of the angels another [[opinion]] seems more capable of defence, certainly our [[faith]] leaves no room to [[doubt]] regarding our [[lord]] himself, that even after his resurrection, and when now in [[spiritual]] but yet real flesh, he ate and drank with his disciples; for not the [[power]], but the need, of eating and drinking is taken from these bodies [[body]]. and so they will be [[spiritual]], not because they shall cease to be bodies [[body]], but because they shall subsist by the quickening spirit.

23. what we are to [[understand]] by the animal and [[spiritual]] [[body]]; or of those who [[die]] in adam, and of those who are made alive in [[christ]].

for as those bodies [[body]] of ours, that have a living [[soul]], though not as yet a quickening spirit, are called soul-informed bodies [[body]], and yet are not souls [[soul]] but bodies [[body]], so also those bodies [[body]] are called [[spiritual]],—yet [[god]] forbid we should therefore suppose them to be spirits and not bodies [[body]],—which, being quickened by the spirit, have the substance, but not the unwieldiness and [[corruption]] of flesh. [[man]] will then be not earthly but heavenly,—not because the [[body]] will not be that very [[body]] which was made of [[earth]], but because by its heavenly endowment it will be a fit inhabitant of [[heaven]], and this not by losing its [[nature]], but by changing its quality. the first [[man]], of the [[earth]] earthy, was made a living [[soul]], not a quickening spirit,—which rank was reserved for him as the [[reward]] of [[obedience]]. and therefore his [[body]], which required meat and drink to satisfy [[hunger]] and thirst, and which had no absolute and indestructible[pg 548] immortality, but by means of the tree of [[life]] warded off the necessity of dying, and was thus maintained in the flower of [[youth]],—this [[body]], i say, was doubtless not [[spiritual]], but animal; and yet it would not have died but that it provoked god's threatened vengeance by offending. and though sustenance was not denied him even outside paradise, yet, being forbidden the tree of [[life]], he was delivered over to the wasting of [[time]], at least in [[respect]] of that [[life]] which, had he not sinned, he might have retained perpetually in paradise, though only in an animal [[body]], till such [[time]] as it became [[spiritual]] in acknowledgment of his [[obedience]].

wherefore, although we [[understand]] that this manifest [[death]], which consists in the separation of [[soul]] and [[body]], was also signified by [[god]] when he said, "in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely [[die]],"[608] it ought not on that account to seem absurd that they were not dismissed from the [[body]] on that very day on which they took the forbidden and death-bringing fruit. for certainly on that very day their [[nature]] was altered for the worse and vitiated, and by their most just [[banishment]] from the tree of [[life]] they were involved in the necessity even of bodily [[death]], in which necessity we are born. and therefore the apostle does not say, "the [[body]] indeed is doomed to [[die]] on account of [[sin]]," but he says, "the [[body]] indeed is [[dead]] because of [[sin]]." then he adds, "but if the spirit of him that raised up [[jesus]] from the [[dead]] dwell in you, he that raised up [[christ]] from the [[dead]] shall also quicken your mortal bodies [[body]] by his spirit that dwelleth in you."[609] then accordingly shall the [[body]] become a quickening spirit which is now a living [[soul]]; and yet the apostle calls it "dead," because already it lies [[lie]] under the necessity of dying. but in paradise it was so made a living [[soul]], though not a quickening spirit, that it could not properly be called [[dead]], for, save through the commission of [[sin]], it could not come under the [[power]] of [[death]]. now, since [[god]] by the words, "adam, where art [[arts]] thou?" pointed to the [[death]] of the [[soul]], which results when he abandons it, and since in the words, "earth thou art [[arts]], and unto [[earth]] shalt thou return,"[610] he signified the [[death]] of the [[body]], which results when the [[soul]] departs from[pg 549] it, we are [[led]], therefore, to [[believe]] that he said nothing of the second [[death]], wishing it to be kept hidden, and reserving it for the new testament dispensation, in which it is most plainly revealed. and this he did in order that, first of all, it might be evident that this first [[death]], which is [[common]] to all, was the result of that [[sin]] which in one [[man]] became [[common]] to all.[611] but the second [[death]] is not [[common]] to all, those being excepted who were "called according to his [[purpose]]. for whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his [[son]], that he might be the first-born among many brethren [[brother]]."[612] those the grace of [[god]] has, by a mediator, delivered from the second [[death]].

thus the apostle states that the first [[man]] was made in an animal [[body]]. for, wishing to distinguish the animal [[body]] which now is from the [[spiritual]], which is to be in the resurrection, he says, "it is sown in [[corruption]], it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in [[glory]]: it is sown in weakness, it is raised in [[power]]: it is sown a [[natural]] [[body]], it is raised a [[spiritual]] [[body]]." then, to prove this, he goes on, "there is a [[natural]] [[body]], and there is a [[spiritual]] [[body]]." and to show what the animated [[body]] is, he says, "thus it was written, the first [[man]] adam was made a living [[soul]], the [[last]] adam was made a quickening spirit."[613] he wished thus to show what the animated [[body]] is, though [[scripture]] did not say of the first [[man]] adam, when his [[soul]] was created by the breath of [[god]], "man was made in an animated [[body]]," but "man was made a living [[soul]]."[614] by these words, therefore, "the first [[man]] was made a living [[soul]]," the apostle wishes [[wish]] man's [[man]] animated [[body]] to be understood. but how he wishes [[wish]] the [[spiritual]] [[body]] to be understood he shows when he adds, "but the [[last]] adam was made a quickening spirit," plainly referring to [[christ]], who has so risen from the [[dead]] that he cannot [[die]] any more. he then goes on to say, "but that was not first which is [[spiritual]], but that which is [[natural]]; and afterward that which is [[spiritual]]." and here he much more clearly asserts that he referred to the animal [[body]] when he said that the first man[pg 550] was made a living [[soul]], and to the [[spiritual]] when he said that the [[last]] [[man]] was made a quickening spirit. the animal [[body]] is the first, being such as the first adam had, and which would not have died had he not sinned, being such also as we now have, its [[nature]] being changed and vitiated by [[sin]] to the extent of bringing us under the necessity of [[death]], and being such as even [[christ]] condescended first of all to assume, not indeed of necessity, but of [[choice]]; but afterwards comes the [[spiritual]] [[body]], which already is worn by anticipation by [[christ]] as our head, and will be worn by his members in the resurrection of the [[dead]].

then the apostle subjoins a notable difference between these two [[men]], saying, "the first [[man]] is of the [[earth]], earthy; the second [[man]] is the [[lord]] from [[heaven]]. as is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. and as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."[615] so he elsewhere says, "as many of you as have been baptized into [[christ]] have put on [[christ]];"[616] but in very deed this shall be accomplished when that which is animal in us by our birth shall have become [[spiritual]] in our resurrection. for, to use his words again, "we are saved by [[hope]]."[617] now we bear the image of the earthly [[man]] by the propagation of [[sin]] and [[death]], which pass on us by ordinary [[generation]]; but we bear the image of the heavenly by the grace of pardon and [[life]] eternal, which regeneration confers upon us through the mediator of [[god]] and [[men]], the [[man]] [[christ]] [[jesus]]. and he is the heavenly [[man]] of paul's passage, because he came from [[heaven]] to be clothed with a [[body]] of earthly [[mortality]], that he might clothe it with heavenly immortality. and he calls others heavenly, because by grace they become his members, that, together with them, he may become one [[christ]], as head and [[body]]. in the same epistle he puts this yet more clearly: "since by [[man]] came [[death]], by [[man]] came also the resurrection of the [[dead]]. for as in adam all [[die]], even so in [[christ]] shall all be made alive,"[618]—that is to say, in a [[spiritual]] [[body]] which shall be made a quickening spirit. not[pg 551] that all who [[die]] in adam shall be members of [[christ]],—for the [[great]] majority shall be punished in eternal [[death]],—but he uses the word "all" in both clauses, because, as no one dies in an animal [[body]] except in adam, so no one is quickened a [[spiritual]] [[body]] save in [[christ]]. we are not, then, by any means to suppose that we shall in the resurrection have such a [[body]] as the first [[man]] had before he sinned, nor that the words, "as is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy," are to be understood of that which was brought about by [[sin]]; for we are not to [[think]] that adam had a [[spiritual]] [[body]] before he fell, and that, in [[punishment]] of his [[sin]], it was changed into an animal [[body]]. if this be [[thought]], small heed has been given to the words of so [[great]] a teacher, who says, "there is a [[natural]] [[body]], there is also a [[spiritual]] [[body]]; as it is written, the first [[man]] adam was made a living [[soul]]." was it after [[sin]] he was made so? or was not this the primal condition of [[man]] from which the blessed apostle selects his testimony to show what the animal [[body]] is?

24. how we must [[understand]] that breathing of [[god]] by which "the first [[man]] was made a living [[soul]]," and that also by which the [[lord]] conveyed his spirit to his disciples when he said, "receive ye the holy ghost."

some have hastily supposed from the words, "god breathed into adam's nostrils the breath of [[life]], and [[man]] became a living [[soul]],"[619] that a [[soul]] was not then first given to [[man]], but that the [[soul]] already given was quickened by the holy ghost. they are encouraged in this supposition by the [[fact]] that the [[lord]] [[jesus]] after his resurrection breathed on his disciples, and said, "receive ye the holy spirit."[620] from this they suppose that the same thing was effected in either case, as if the evangelist had gone on to say, and they became living souls [[soul]]. but if he had made this addition, we should only [[understand]] that the spirit is in some way the [[life]] of souls [[soul]], and that without him reasonable souls [[soul]] must be accounted [[dead]], though their bodies [[body]] seem to [[live]] before our [[eyes]]. but that this was not what happened when [[man]] was created, the very words of the narrative sufficiently show: "and [[god]] made [[man]] dust of the [[earth]];" which some have [[thought]] to render more clearly by the words, "and [[god]] formed [[man]] of the clay[pg 552] of the [[earth]]." for it had before been said that "there went up a mist from the [[earth]], and watered the whole face of the ground,"[621] in order that the reference to clay, formed of this moisture and dust, might be understood. for on this verse there immediately follows the announcement, "and [[god]] created [[man]] dust of the [[earth]];" so those [[greek]] manuscripts have it from which this passage has been translated into latin. but whether one prefers to [[read]] "created" or "formed," where the [[greek]] reads ἔπλασεν, is of little importance; yet "formed" is the [[better]] rendering. but those who preferred "created" [[thought]] they thus avoided the ambiguity arising from the [[fact]], that in the latin [[language]] the usage obtains that those are said to form a thing who frame some feigned and fictitious thing. this [[man]], then, who was created of the dust of the [[earth]], or of the moistened dust or clay,—this "dust of the earth" (that i may use the express words of scripture) was made, as the apostle teaches [[teach]], an animated [[body]] when he received a [[soul]]. this [[man]], he says, "was made a living [[soul]];" that is, this fashioned dust was made a living [[soul]].

they say, already he had a [[soul]], else he would not be called a [[man]]; for [[man]] is not a [[body]] alone, nor a [[soul]] alone, but a being composed of both. this, indeed, is true, that the [[soul]] is not the whole [[man]], but the [[better]] part of [[man]]; the [[body]] not the whole, but the inferior part of [[man]]; and that then, when both are joined, they receive the name of [[man]],—which, however, they do not severally lose even when we speak of them singly. for who is prohibited from saying, in colloquial usage, "that [[man]] is [[dead]], and is now at rest or in torment," though this can be spoken only of the [[soul]]; or "he is buried in such and such a place," though this refers only to the [[body]]? will they say that [[scripture]] follows no such usage? on the contrary, it so thoroughly adopts it, that even while a [[man]] is alive, and [[body]] and [[soul]] are [[united]], it calls each of them singly by the name "man," speaking of the [[soul]] as the "inward [[man]]," and of the [[body]] as the "outward [[man]],"[622] as if there were two [[men]], though both together are indeed but one. but we must [[understand]] in what sense [[man]] is said to be in the image of [[god]], and is yet dust, and to return to the[pg 553] dust. the former is spoken of the [[rational]] [[soul]], which [[god]] by his breathing, or, to speak more appropriately, by his inspiration, conveyed to [[man]], that is, to his [[body]]; but the latter refers to his [[body]], which [[god]] formed of the dust, and to which a [[soul]] was given, that it might become a living [[body]], that is, that [[man]] might become a living [[soul]].

wherefore, when our [[lord]] breathed on his disciples, and said, "receive ye the holy ghost," he certainly wished it to be understood that the holy ghost was not only the spirit of the [[father]], but of the only-begotten [[son]] himself. for the same spirit is, indeed, the spirit of the [[father]] and of the [[son]], making with them the trinity of [[father]], [[son]], and spirit, not a creature, but the creator. for neither was that material breath which proceeded from the mouth of his flesh the very substance and [[nature]] of the holy spirit, but rather the intimation, as i said, that the holy spirit was [[common]] to the [[father]] and to the [[son]]; for they have not each a separate spirit, but both one and the same. now this spirit is always spoken of in [[sacred]] [[scripture]] by the [[greek]] word πνεῦμα, as the [[lord]], too, named him in the place cited when he gave him to his disciples, and intimated the gift by the breathing of his lips; and there does not occur to me any place in the whole scriptures [[scripture]] where he is otherwise named. but in this passage where it is said, "and the [[lord]] formed [[man]] dust of the [[earth]], and breathed, or inspired, into his face the breath of [[life]];" the [[greek]] has not πνεῦμα, the usual word for the holy spirit, but πνοή, a word more frequently used of the creature than of the creator; and for this [[reason]] some latin interpreters have preferred to render it by "breath" rather than "spirit." for this word occurs also in the [[greek]] in isa. lvii. 16, where [[god]] says, "i have made all breath," meaning, doubtless, all souls [[soul]]. accordingly, this word πνοή is sometimes rendered "breath," sometimes "spirit," sometimes "inspiration," sometimes "aspiration," sometimes "soul," even when it is used of [[god]]. πνεῦμα, on the other hand, is uniformly rendered "spirit," whether of [[man]], of whom the apostle says, "for what [[man]] knoweth the things of a [[man]], save the spirit of [[man]] which is in him?"[623] or of beast, as in the [[book]] of[pg 554] solomon, "who knoweth the spirit of [[man]] that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the [[earth]]?"[624] or of that physical spirit which is called wind, for so the psalmist calls it: "fire and hail; snow and vapours; stormy wind;"[625] or of the uncreated creator spirit, of whom the [[lord]] said in the gospel, "receive ye the holy ghost," indicating the gift by the breathing of his mouth; and when he says, "go ye and baptize all nations in the name of the [[father]], of the [[son]], and of the holy ghost,"[626] words which very expressly and excellently commend the trinity; and where it is said, "god is a spirit;"[627] and in very many other places of the [[sacred]] writings. in all these quotations from [[scripture]] we do not find in the [[greek]] the word πνοή used, but πνεῦμα, and in the latin, not flatus, but spiritus. wherefore, referring again to that place where it is written, "he inspired," or, to speak more properly, "breathed into his face the breath of [[life]]," even though the [[greek]] had not used πνοή (as it has) but πνεῦμα, it would not on that account necessarily [[follow]] that the creator spirit, who in the trinity is distinctively called the holy ghost, was meant, since, as has been said, it is plain that πνεῦμα is used not only of the creator, but also of the creature.

but, say they, when the [[scripture]] used the word "spirit,"[628] it would not have added "of life" unless it meant us to [[understand]] the holy spirit; nor, when it said, "man became a [[soul]]," would it also have inserted the word "living" unless that [[life]] of the [[soul]] were signified which is imparted to it from above by the gift of [[god]]. for, seeing that the [[soul]] by itself has a proper [[life]] of its own, what need, they ask, was there of adding living, save only to show that the [[life]] which is given it by the holy spirit was meant? what is this but to [[fight]] strenuously for their own conjectures, while they carelessly neglect the teaching of [[scripture]]? without troubling themselves much, they might have found in a preceding page of this very [[book]] of genesis the words, "let the [[earth]] bring forth the living [[soul]],"[629] when all the terrestrial animals were created. then at a slight interval, but still in the same [[book]],[pg 555] was it impossible for them to notice this verse, "all in whose nostrils was the breath of [[life]], of all that was in the dry [[land]], died," by which it was signified that all the animals which lived on the [[earth]] had perished in the deluge? if, then, we find that [[scripture]] is accustomed to speak both of the "living soul" and the "spirit of life" even in reference to beasts; and if in this place, where it is said, "all things which have the spirit of [[life]]," the word πνοή, not πνεῦμα, is used; why may we not say, what need was there to add "living," since the [[soul]] cannot [[exist]] without being alive? or, what need to add "of life" after the word spirit? but we [[understand]] that [[scripture]] used these expressions in its ordinary style so long as it speaks of animals, that is, animated bodies [[body]], in which the [[soul]] serves as the residence of sensation; but when [[man]] is spoken of, we forget the ordinary and established usage of [[scripture]], whereby it signifies that [[man]] received a [[rational]] [[soul]], which was not produced out of the waters and the [[earth]] like the other living creatures, but was created by the breath of [[god]]. yet this creation was so ordered that the [[human]] [[soul]] should [[live]] in an animal [[body]], like those other animals of which the [[scripture]] said, "let the [[earth]] [[produce]] every living [[soul]]," and regarding which it again says that in them is the breath of [[life]], where the word πνοή and not πνεῦμα is used in the [[greek]], and where certainly not the holy spirit, but their spirit, is signified under that name.

but, again, they object that breath is understood to have been emitted from the mouth of [[god]]; and if we [[believe]] that is the [[soul]], we must consequently acknowledge it to be of the same substance, and [[equal]] to that [[wisdom]], which says, "i come out of the mouth of the most high."[630] [[wisdom]], indeed, does not say it was breathed out of the mouth of [[god]], but proceeded out of it. but as we are able, when we breathe, to make a breath, not of our own [[human]] [[nature]], but of the surrounding air, which we inhale and exhale as we draw our breath and breathe again, so almighty [[god]] was able to make breath, not of his own [[nature]], nor of the creature beneath him, but even of nothing; and this breath, when he communicated it to man's [[man]] [[body]], he is most appropriately said to[pg 556] have breathed or inspired,—the immaterial breathing it also immaterial, but the immutable not also the immutable; for it was created, he uncreated. yet, that these persons [[person]] who are forward to quote [[scripture]], and yet [[know]] not the usages of its [[language]], may [[know]] that not only what is [[equal]] and consubstantial with [[god]] is said to proceed out of his mouth, let them hear or [[read]] what [[god]] says: "so then because thou art [[arts]] lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, i will spue thee out of my mouth."[631]

there is no ground, then, for our objecting, when the apostle so expressly distinguishes the animal [[body]] from the [[spiritual]],—that is to say, the [[body]] in which we now are from that in which we are to be. he says, "it is sown a [[natural]] [[body]], it is raised a [[spiritual]] [[body]]. there is a [[natural]] [[body]], and there is a [[spiritual]] [[body]]. and so it is written, the first [[man]] adam was made a living [[soul]]; the [[last]] adam was made a quickening spirit. howbeit that was not first which is [[spiritual]], but that which is [[natural]]; and afterward that which is [[spiritual]]. the first [[man]] is of the [[earth]], earthy; the second [[man]] is the [[lord]] from [[heaven]]. as is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. and as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."[632] of all which words of his we have previously spoken. the animal [[body]], accordingly, in which the apostle says that the first [[man]] adam was made, was not so made that it could not [[die]] at all, but so that it should not [[die]] unless he should have sinned. that [[body]], indeed, which shall be made [[spiritual]] and [[immortal]] by the quickening spirit shall not be able to [[die]] at all; as the [[soul]] has been created [[immortal]], and therefore, although by [[sin]] it may be said to [[die]], and does lose a [[certain]] [[life]] of its own, namely, the spirit of [[god]], by whom it was enabled to [[live]] wisely and blessedly, yet it does not cease living a [[kind]] of [[life]], though a miserable, because it is [[immortal]] by creation. so, too, the rebellious angels, though by sinning they did in a sense [[die]], because they forsook [[god]], the fountain of [[life]], which while they drank they were able to [[live]] wisely and well, yet they could not so [[die]] as to utterly cease living and[pg 557] feeling, for they are immortals [[immortal]] by creation. and so, after the final [[judgment]], they shall be hurled into the second [[death]], and not even there be deprived of [[life]] or of sensation, but shall suffer torment. but those [[men]] who have been embraced by god's grace, and are become the fellow-citizens of the holy angels who have continued in bliss, shall never more either [[sin]] or [[die]], being endued with [[spiritual]] bodies [[body]]; yet, being clothed with immortality, such as the angels enjoy, of which they cannot be divested even by sinning, the [[nature]] of their flesh shall continue the same, but all carnal [[corruption]] and unwieldiness shall be removed.

there remains a [[question]] which must be discussed, and, by the [[help]] of the [[lord]] [[god]] of [[truth]], solved: if the motion of concupiscence in the unruly members of our first parents arose out of their [[sin]], and only when the [[divine]] grace deserted them; and if it was on that [[occasion]] that their [[eyes]] were opened to see, or, more exactly, notice their nakedness, and that they covered their shame because the shameless motion of their members was not [[subject]] to their will,—how, then, would they have begotten [[children]] had they remained sinless as they were created? but as this [[book]] must be concluded, and so large a [[question]] cannot be summarily disposed of, we may relegate it to the following [[book]], in which it will be more conveniently treated.
