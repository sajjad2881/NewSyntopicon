the republic
by plato


translated by benjamin jowett

----------------------------------------------------------------------

the introduction

the [[republic]] of [[plato]] is the longest of his works [[work]] with the exception
of the laws [[law]], and is certainly the [[greatest]] of them. there are nearer
approaches to [[modern]] metaphysics in the philebus and in the sophist;
the politicus or statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions
of the [[state]] are more clearly drawn out in the laws [[law]]; as works [[work]] of art [[arts]],
the symposium and the protagoras are of higher excellence. but no
other dialogue of [[plato]] has the same largeness of view and the same
perfection of style; no other shows an [[equal]] [[knowledge]] of the [[world]],
or contains more of those thoughts [[thought]] which are new as well as old, and
not of one [[age]] only but of all. nowhere in [[plato]] is there a deeper
irony or a greater [[wealth]] of humor or imagery, or more dramatic [[power]].
nor in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave
life and speculation, or to connect [[politics]] with [[philosophy]]. the
republic is the centre around which the other dialogues may be grouped;
here [[philosophy]] reaches the highest point to which ancient thinkers
ever attained. [[plato]] among the greeks [[greek]], like bacon among the moderns,
was the first who conceived a method of [[knowledge]], although neither
of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance
of [[truth]]; and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of
science which was not yet realized. he was the [[greatest]] metaphysical
genius whom the [[world]] has seen; and in him, more than in any other
ancient thinker, the germs of future [[knowledge]] are contained. the
sciences of [[logic]] and psychology, which have supplied so many instruments
of [[thought]] to after-ages, are based upon the analyses of socrates
and [[plato]]. the principles [[principle]] of definition, the [[law]] of contradiction,
the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction between the essence
and accidents of a thing or notion, between means and ends, between
causes and conditions; also the division of the [[mind]] into the [[rational]],
concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures [[pleasure]] and desires
into necessary and unnecessary --these and other [[great]] forms of thought
are all of them to be found in the [[republic]], and were probably first
invented by [[plato]]. the [[greatest]] of all logical truths [[truth]], and the one
of which writers on [[philosophy]] are most apt to lose sight, the difference
between words and things, has been most strenuously insisted on by
him, although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his
own writings. but he does not bind up [[truth]] in logical formulae, --logic
is still veiled in metaphysics; and the [[science]] which he imagines
to "contemplate all [[truth]] and all existence" is very unlike the doctrine
of the syllogism which [[aristotle]] claims to have discovered.

neither must we forget that the [[republic]] is but the third part of
a still larger design which was to have included an ideal history
of [[athens]], as well as a [[political]] and physical [[philosophy]]. the fragment
of the critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only
in importance to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur; and is
said as a [[fact]] to have inspired some of the early navigators of the
sixteenth century. this mythical tale, of which the [[subject]] was a
history of the wars [[war]] of the athenians against the island of atlantis,
is supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of solon, to which
it would have stood in the same relation as the writings of the logographers
to the poems of [[homer]]. it would have told of a struggle for [[liberty]],
intended to represent the conflict of [[persia]] and hellas. we may judge
from the [[noble]] commencement of the timaeus, from the fragment of the
critias itself, and from the third [[book]] of the laws [[law]], in what manner
plato would have treated this high argument. we can only guess why
the [[great]] design was abandoned; perhaps because [[plato]] became sensible
of some incongruity in a fictitious [[history]], or because he had lost
his interest in it, or because advancing years forbade the completion
of it; and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary
narrative ever been finished, we should have found [[plato]] himself sympathizing
with the struggle for hellenic independence, singing a hymn of triumph
over marathon and salamis, perhaps making the reflection of herodotus
where he contemplates the [[growth]] of the athenian empire--"how brave
a thing is [[freedom]] of [[speech]], which has made the athenians so far
exceed every other [[state]] of hellas in greatness!" or, more probably,
attributing the [[victory]] to the ancient [[good]] order of [[athens]] and to
the favor of [[apollo]] and athene. 

again, [[plato]] may be regarded as the "captain" ('arhchegoz') or leader
of a goodly band of followers; for in the [[republic]] is to be found
the original of cicero's de republica, of st. augustine's [[city]] of
god, of the utopia of sir thomas more, and of the numerous other imaginary
states which are framed upon the same model. the extent to which aristotle
or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in the [[politics]] has
been little recognized, and the recognition is the more necessary
because it is not made by [[aristotle]] himself. the two philosophers
had more in [[common]] than they were conscious of; and probably some
elements of [[plato]] remain still undetected in [[aristotle]]. in english
philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in the works
of the cambridge platonists, but in [[great]] original writers like berkeley
or coleridge, to [[plato]] and his ideas [[idea]]. that there is a [[truth]] higher
than [[experience]], of which the [[mind]] bears witness to herself, is a
conviction which in our own [[generation]] has been enthusiastically asserted,
and is perhaps gaining ground. of the [[greek]] authors who at the renaissance
brought a new [[life]] into the [[world]] [[plato]] has had the [[greatest]] influence.
the [[republic]] of [[plato]] is also the first treatise upon [[education]], of
which the writings of milton and locke, [[rousseau]], jean paul, and goethe
are the legitimate descendants. like dante or bunyan, he has a revelation
of another [[life]]; like bacon, he is profoundly impressed with the un
unity of [[knowledge]]; in the early [[church]] he exercised a real influence
on theology, and at the revival of literature on [[politics]]. even the
fragments of his words when "repeated at second-hand" have in all
ages ravished the hearts [[heart]] of [[men]], who have seen reflected in them their
own higher [[nature]]. he is the [[father]] of idealism in [[philosophy]], in
politics, in literature. and many of the latest conceptions of modern
thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of [[knowledge]], the reign
of [[law]], and the equality of the sexes [[sex]], have been anticipated in a
dream by him. 

argument 

the argument of the [[republic]] is the search after [[justice]], the nature
of which is first hinted at by cephalus, the just and blameless old
man --then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socrates
and polemarchus --then caricatured by thrasymachus and partially explained
by [[socrates]] --reduced to an abstraction by glaucon and adeimantus,
and having become invisible in the [[individual]] reappears at length
in the ideal [[state]] which is constructed by [[socrates]]. the first care
of the rulers is to be [[education]], of which an outline is drawn after
the old hellenic model, providing only for an improved [[religion]] and
morality, and more simplicity in [[music]] and gymnastic, a manlier strain
of poetry, and greater harmony of the [[individual]] and the [[state]]. we
are thus [[led]] on to the conception of a higher [[state]], in which "no
man calls anything his own," and in which there is neither "marrying
nor giving in [[marriage]]," and "kings are philosophers" and "philosophers
are kings [[king]];" and there is another and higher [[education]], intellectual
as well as [[moral]] and [[religious]], of [[science]] as well as of art [[arts]], and
not of [[youth]] only but of the whole of [[life]]. such a [[state]] is hardly
to be realized in this [[world]] and would quickly degenerate. to the
perfect ideal succeeds the [[government]] of the soldier and the lover
of [[honor]], this again declining into [[democracy]], and [[democracy]] into
tyranny, in an imaginary but regular order having not much resemblance
to the actual facts [[fact]]. when "the wheel has come full circle" we do not
begin again with a new period of [[human]] [[life]]; but we have passed from
the [[best]] to the worst, and there we end. the [[subject]] is then changed
and the old quarrel of poetry and [[philosophy]] which had been more lightly
treated in the earlier books [[book]] of the [[republic]] is now resumed and fought
out to a conclusion. poetry is discovered to be an imitation thrice
removed from the [[truth]], and [[homer]], as well as the dramatic poets,
having been condemned as an imitator, is sent into [[banishment]] along
with them. and the [[idea]] of the [[state]] is supplemented by the revelation
of a future [[life]]. 

the division into books [[book]], like all similar divisions, is probably later
than the [[age]] of [[plato]]. the [[natural]] divisions are five in number; --(1)
book i and the first half of [[book]] ii down to the paragraph beginning,
"i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus," which
is introductory; the first [[book]] containing a refutation of the popular
and sophistical notions of [[justice]], and concluding, like some of the
earlier dialogues, without arriving at any definite result. to this
is appended a restatement of the [[nature]] of [[justice]] according to common
opinion, and an [[answer]] is demanded to the [[question]] --what is [[justice]],
stripped of appearances? the second division (2) includes the remainder
of the second and the whole of the third and fourth books [[book]], which are
mainly occupied with the construction of the first [[state]] and the first
education. the third division (3) consists of the fifth, sixth, and
seventh books [[book]], in which [[philosophy]] rather than [[justice]] is the subject
of inquiry, and the second [[state]] is constructed on principles [[principle]] of communism
and ruled by [[philosophers]], and the contemplation of the [[idea]] of good
takes the place of the social and [[political]] virtues [[virtue]]. in the eighth
and ninth books [[book]] (4) the perversions of states and of the individuals
who correspond to them are reviewed in succession; and the nature
of [[pleasure]] and the [[principle]] of [[tyranny]] are further analyzed in the
individual [[man]]. the tenth [[book]] (5) is the conclusion of the whole,
in which the relations of [[philosophy]] to poetry are finally determined,
and the [[happiness]] of the [[citizens]] in this [[life]], which has now been
assured, is crowned by the vision of another. 

or a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the first
(books i - iv) containing the description of a [[state]] framed generally
in accordance with hellenic notions of [[religion]] and morality, while
in the second (books v - x) the hellenic [[state]] is transformed into
an ideal [[kingdom]] of [[philosophy]], of which all other governments [[government]] are
the perversions. these two points of view are really opposed, and
the opposition is only veiled by the genius of [[plato]]. the [[republic]],
like the phaedrus, is an imperfect whole; the higher [[light]] of philosophy
breaks through the regularity of the hellenic temple, which at last
fades away into the heavens [[heaven]]. whether this imperfection of structure
arises from an enlargement of the plan; or from the imperfect reconcilement
in the writer's own [[mind]] of the struggling elements of [[thought]] which
are now first brought together by him; or, perhaps, from the composition
of the [[work]] at different times [[time]] --are questions [[question]], like the similar question
about the iliad and the odyssey, which are worth asking, but which
cannot have a distinct [[answer]]. in the [[age]] of [[plato]] there was no regular
mode of publication, and an author would have the less scruple in
altering or adding to a [[work]] which was known only to a few of his
friends. there is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid
his labors aside for a [[time]], or turned from one [[work]] to another; and
such interruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a
long than of a short writing. in all attempts to determine the chronological
he order of the platonic writings on internal evidence, this uncertainty
about any [[single]] dialogue being composed at one [[time]] is a disturbing
element, which must be admitted to affect longer works [[work]], such as the
republic and the laws [[law]], more than shorter ones. but, on the other hand,
the seeming discrepancies of the [[republic]] may only arise out of the
discordant elements which the philosopher has attempted to unite in
a [[single]] whole, perhaps without being himself able to recognize the
inconsistency which is obvious to us. for there is a [[judgment]] of after
ages which few [[great]] writers have ever been able to anticipate for
themselves. they do not perceive the want of connection in their own
writings, or the gaps in their systems [[system]] which are visible enough to
those who come after them. in the beginnings of literature and [[philosophy]],
amid the first efforts of [[thought]] and [[language]], more inconsistencies
occur than now, when the paths of speculation are well worn and the
meaning of words precisely defined. for consistency, too, is the growth
of [[time]]; and some of the [[greatest]] creations of the [[human]] [[mind]] have
been wanting in unity. tried by this test, several of the platonic
dialogues, according to our [[modern]] ideas [[idea]], appear to be defective,
but the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at different
times or by different hands. and the supposition that the republic
was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some
degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of the work
to another. 

the second title, "concerning [[justice]]," is not the one by which the
republic is quoted, either by [[aristotle]] or generally in antiquity,
and, like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues, may therefore
be assumed to be of later date. morgenstern and others have asked
whether the definition of [[justice]], which is the professed aim, or
the construction of the [[state]] is the principal argument of the [[work]].
the [[answer]] is, that the two blend in one, and are two faces of the
same [[truth]]; for [[justice]] is the order of the [[state]], and the [[state]] is
the visible embodiment of [[justice]] under the conditions of [[human]] [[society]].
the one is the [[soul]] and the other is the [[body]], and the [[greek]] ideal
of the [[state]], as of the [[individual]], is a [[fair]] [[mind]] in a [[fair]] [[body]].
in hegelian phraseology the [[state]] is the reality of which justice
is the ideal. or, described in [[christian]] [[language]], the [[kingdom]] of
god is within, and yet develops into a [[church]] or external [[kingdom]];
"the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens [[heaven]]," is reduced
to the proportions of an earthly building. or, to use a platonic image,
justice and the [[state]] are the warp and the woof which run through
the whole texture. and when the [[constitution]] of the [[state]] is completed,
the conception of [[justice]] is not dismissed, but reappears under the
same or different names throughout the [[work]], both as the inner law
of the [[individual]] [[soul]], and finally as the [[principle]] of rewards [[reward]] and
punishments in another [[life]]. the virtues [[virtue]] are based on [[justice]], of
which [[common]] honesty in buying and selling is the shadow, and justice
is based on the [[idea]] of [[good]], which is the harmony of the [[world]], and
is reflected both in the [[institutions]] of states and in motions of
the heavenly bodies [[body]]. the timaeus, which takes up the [[political]] rather
than the ethical side of the [[republic]], and is chiefly occupied with
hypotheses concerning the outward [[world]], yet contains many indications
that the same [[law]] is supposed to reign over the [[state]], over [[nature]],
and over [[man]]. 

too much, however, has been made of this [[question]] both in ancient
and in [[modern]] times [[time]]. there is a stage of criticism in which all works [[work]],
whether of [[nature]] or of art [[arts]], are referred to design. now in ancient
writings, and indeed in literature generally, there remains often
a large element which was not comprehended in the original design.
for the plan grows under the author's hand; new thoughts [[thought]] occur to
him in the act of writing; he has not worked out the argument to the
end before he begins. the reader who seeks to find some one [[idea]] under
which the whole may be conceived, must necessarily seize on the vaguest
and most general. thus stallbaum, who is dissatisfied with the ordinary
explanations of the argument of the [[republic]], imagines himself to
have found the true argument "in the representation of [[human]] life
in a [[state]] perfected by [[justice]] and governed according to the idea
of [[good]]." there may be some use in such general descriptions, but
they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer. the truth
is, that we may as well speak of many designs as of one; nor need
anything be excluded from the plan of a [[great]] [[work]] to which the mind
is naturally [[led]] by the association of ideas [[idea]], and which does not interfere
with the general [[purpose]]. what [[kind]] or [[degree]] of unity is to be sought
after in a building, in the plastic [[arts]], in poetry, in prose, is
a problem which has to be determined relatively to the subject-matter.
to [[plato]] himself, the inquiry "what was the intention of the writer,"
or "what was the principal argument of the republic" would have been
hardly intelligible, and therefore had [[better]] be at once dismissed.

is not the [[republic]] the vehicle of three or four [[great]] truths [[truth]] which,
to plato's own [[mind]], are most naturally represented in the form of
the [[state]]? just as in the jewish prophets [[prophet]] the reign of messiah, or
"the day of the [[lord]]," or the suffering servant or [[people]] of [[god]],
or the "sun of [[righteousness]] with healing in his wings" only convey,
to us at least, their [[great]] [[spiritual]] ideals, so through the greek
state [[plato]] reveals to us his own thoughts [[thought]] about [[divine]] [[perfection]],
which is the [[idea]] of [[good]] --like the sun in the visible [[world]]; --about
human [[perfection]], which is [[justice]] --about [[education]] beginning in
youth and continuing in later years --about poets and sophists and
tyrants who are the false teachers and [[evil]] rulers of [[mankind]] --about
"the world" which is the embodiment of them --about a [[kingdom]] which
exists nowhere upon [[earth]] but is laid up in [[heaven]] to be the pattern
and [[rule]] of [[human]] [[life]]. no such inspired creation is at unity with
itself, any more than the clouds of [[heaven]] when the sun pierces through
them. every shade of [[light]] and dark, of [[truth]], and of fiction which
is the veil of [[truth]], is allowable in a [[work]] of philosophical [[imagination]].
it is not all on the same plane; it easily passes from ideas [[idea]] to myths
and fancies, from facts [[fact]] to figures of [[speech]]. it is not prose but
poetry, at least a [[great]] part of it, and ought not to be judged by
the rules [[rule]] of [[logic]] or the probabilities of [[history]]. the writer is
not fashioning his ideas [[idea]] into an artistic whole; they take possession
of him and are too much for him. we have no need therefore to discuss
whether a [[state]] such as [[plato]] has conceived is practicable or not,
or whether the outward form or the inward [[life]] came first into the
mind of the writer. for the practicability of his ideas [[idea]] has nothing
to do with their [[truth]]; and the highest thoughts [[thought]] to which he attains
may be truly said to bear the [[greatest]] "marks of design" --justice
more than the external frame-work of the [[state]], the [[idea]] of [[good]] more
than [[justice]]. the [[great]] [[science]] of dialectic or the organization of
ideas has no real content; but is only a type of the method or spirit
in which the higher [[knowledge]] is to be pursued by the spectator of
all [[time]] and all existence. it is in the fifth, sixth, and seventh
books that [[plato]] reaches the "summit of speculation," and these, although
they fail to satisfy the requirements of a [[modern]] thinker, may therefore
be regarded as the most important, as they are also the most original,
portions of the [[work]]. 

it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor [[question]] which has
been raised by boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the
conversation was held (the year 411 b. c. which is proposed by him
will do as well as any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially
a writer who, like [[plato]], is notoriously careless of chronology, only
aims at general probability. whether all the persons [[person]] mentioned in
the [[republic]] could ever have met at any one [[time]] is not a difficulty
which would have occurred to an athenian reading the [[work]] forty years
later, or to [[plato]] himself at the [[time]] of writing (any more than to
shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas); and need not greatly
trouble us now. yet this may be a [[question]] having no [[answer]] "which
is still worth asking," because the investigation shows that we can
not argue historically from the dates in [[plato]]; it would be useless
therefore to waste [[time]] in inventing far-fetched reconcilements of
them in order avoid chronological difficulties, such, for [[example]],
as the conjecture of c. f. hermann, that glaucon and adeimantus are
not the brothers [[brother]] but the uncles of [[plato]], or the fancy of stallbaum
that [[plato]] intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at
which some of his dialogues were written. 

characters 

the principal characters [[character]] in the [[republic]] are cephalus, polemarchus,
thrasymachus, [[socrates]], glaucon, and adeimantus. cephalus appears
in the introduction only, polemarchus drops at the end of the first
argument, and thrasymachus is reduced to [[silence]] at the close of the
first [[book]]. the main discussion is carried on by [[socrates]], glaucon,
and adeimantus. among the company are lysias (the orator) and euthydemus,
the sons [[son]] of cephalus and brothers [[brother]] of polemarchus, an unknown charmantides
--these are mute auditors; also there is cleitophon, who once interrupts,
where, as in the dialogue which bears his name, he appears as the
friend and ally of thrasymachus. 

cephalus, the patriarch of house, has been appropriately engaged in
offering a [[sacrifice]]. he is the pattern of an old [[man]] who has almost
done with [[life]], and is at [[peace]] with himself and with all [[mankind]].
he feels [[feel]] that he is drawing nearer to the [[world]] below, and seems to
linger around the memory of the [[past]]. he is eager that [[socrates]] should
come to visit him, fond of the poetry of the [[last]] [[generation]], happy
in the [[consciousness]] of a well-spent [[life]], glad at having escaped
from the [[tyranny]] of youthful lusts. his [[love]] of conversation, his
affection, his indifference to riches [[rich]], even his garrulity, are interesting
traits of [[character]]. he is not one of those who have nothing to say,
because their whole [[mind]] has been absorbed in making [[money]]. yet he
acknowledges that riches [[rich]] have the advantage of placing [[men]] above the
temptation to dishonesty or falsehood. the respectful attention shown
to him by [[socrates]], whose [[love]] of conversation, no less than the mission
imposed upon him by the oracle, leads him to ask questions [[question]] of all
men, [[young]] and old alike, should also be noted. who [[better]] suited
to raise the [[question]] of [[justice]] than cephalus, whose [[life]] might seem
to be the expression of it? the moderation with which old [[age]] is pictured
by cephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic,
not only of him, but of [[greek]] feeling generally, and contrasts with
the exaggeration of cicero in the de senectute. the evening of life
is described by [[plato]] in the most expressive manner, yet with the
fewest possible touches. as cicero remarks (ep. ad attic. iv. 16),
the aged cephalus would have been out of place in the discussion which
follows, and which he could neither have understood nor taken part
in without a violation of dramatic propriety. 

his "son and heir" polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness
of [[youth]]; he is for detaining [[socrates]] by [[force]] in the opening scene,
and will not "let him off" on the [[subject]] of [[women]] and [[children]]. like
cephalus, he is limited in his point of view, and represents the proverbial
stage of morality which has rules [[rule]] of [[life]] rather than principles [[principle]];
and he quotes simonides as his [[father]] had quoted pindar. but after
this he has no more to say; the answers [[answer]] which he makes are only elicited
from him by the dialectic of [[socrates]]. he has not yet experienced
the influence of the sophists like glaucon and adeimantus, nor is
he sensible of the necessity of refuting them; he belongs to the pre-socratic
or pre-dialectical [[age]]. he is incapable of arguing, and is bewildered
by [[socrates]] to such a [[degree]] that he does not [[know]] what he is saying.
he is made to admit that [[justice]] is a thief, and that the virtues
follow the analogy of the [[arts]]. from his [[brother]] lysias we learn that
he fell a victim to the thirty tyrants [[tyrant]], but no allusion is here made
to his [[fate]], nor to the circumstance that cephalus and his family
were of syracusan origin, and had migrated from thurii to [[athens]].

the "chalcedonian giant," thrasymachus, of whom we have already heard
in the phaedrus, is the personification of the sophists, according
to plato's conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics.
he is [[vain]] and blustering, refusing to discourse unless he is paid,
fond of making an oration, and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable
socrates; but a mere child in argument, and unable to foresee that
the next "move" (to use a platonic expression) will "shut him up."
he has reached the stage of framing general notions, and in this respect
is in advance of cephalus and polemarchus. but he is incapable of
defending them in a discussion, and vainly tries to cover his confusion
in banter and insolence. whether such doctrines as are attributed
to him by [[plato]] were really held either by him or by any other sophist
is uncertain; in the infancy of [[philosophy]] serious errors about morality
might easily grow up --they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers
in thucydides; but we are concerned at [[present]] with plato's description
of him, and not with the historical reality. the inequality of the
contest adds greatly to the humor of the scene. the pompous and empty
sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the [[great]] master of dialectic,
who knows [[know]] how to touch all the springs of vanity and weakness in him.
he is greatly irritated by the irony of [[socrates]], but his noisy and
imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the thrusts of his
assailant. his determination to cram down their throats, or put "bodily
into their souls" his own words, elicits a cry of [[horror]] from [[socrates]].
the [[state]] of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as the process
of the argument. nothing is more amusing than his complete submission
when he has been once thoroughly beaten. at first he seems to continue
the discussion with reluctance, but soon with apparent good-will,
and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one or two
occasional remarks. when attacked by glaucon he is humorously protected
by [[socrates]] "as one who has never been his [[enemy]] and is now his friend."
from cicero and quintilian and from aristotle's rhetoric we learn
that the sophist whom [[plato]] has made so ridiculous was a [[man]] of note
whose writings were preserved in later ages [[age]]. the play on his name
which was made by his contemporary herodicus, "thou wast ever bold
in [[battle]]," seems to show that the description of him is not devoid
of verisimilitude. 

when thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principal respondents,
glaucon and adeimantus, appear on the scene: here, as in [[greek]] tragedy,
three actors are introduced. at first sight the two sons [[son]] of ariston
may seem to wear a [[family]] likeness, like the two [[friends]] simmias and
cebes in the phaedo. but on a nearer examination of them the similarity
vanishes, and they are seen to be distinct characters [[character]]. glaucon is
the impetuous [[youth]] who can "just never have enough of fechting" (cf.
the [[character]] of him in xen. mem. iii. 6); the [[man]] of [[pleasure]] who
is acquainted with the mysteries of [[love]]; the "juvenis qui gaudet
canibus," and who improves the breed of animals; the lover of art
and [[music]] who has all the experiences of youthful [[life]]. he is full
of quickness and penetration, piercing easily below the clumsy platitudes
of thrasymachus to the real difficulty; he turns out to the light
the seamy side of [[human]] [[life]], and yet does not lose [[faith]] in the just
and true. it is glaucon who seizes what may be termed the ludicrous
relation of the philosopher to the [[world]], to whom a [[state]] of simplicity
is "a [[city]] of pigs," who is always prepared with a jest when the argument
offers him an opportunity, and who is ever ready to second the humor
of [[socrates]] and to appreciate the ridiculous, whether in the connoisseurs
of [[music]], or in the lovers of theatricals, or in the fantastic behavior
of the [[citizens]] of [[democracy]]. his weaknesses are several times [[time]] alluded
to by [[socrates]], who, however, will not allow him to be attacked by
his [[brother]] adeimantus. he is a soldier, and, like adeimantus, has
been distinguished at the [[battle]] of megara. 

the [[character]] of adeimantus is deeper and graver, and the profounder
objections are commonly put into his mouth. glaucon is more demonstrative,
and generally opens the game. adeimantus pursues the argument further.
glaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of [[youth]]; adeimantus
has the maturer [[judgment]] of a grown-up [[man]] of the [[world]]. in the second
book, when glaucon insists that [[justice]] and [[injustice]] shall be considered
without regard to their consequences, adeimantus remarks that they
are regarded by [[mankind]] in general only for the sake of their consequences;
and in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the
fourth [[book]] that [[socrates]] falls in making his [[citizens]] [[happy]], and
is answered that [[happiness]] is not the first but the second thing,
not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of the [[good]] government
of a [[state]]. in the discussion about [[religion]] and mythology, adeimantus
is the respondent, but glaucon breaks in with a slight jest, and carries
on the conversation in a lighter tone about [[music]] and gymnastic to
the end of the [[book]]. it is adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism
of [[common]] sense on the socratic method of argument, and who refuses
to let [[socrates]] pass lightly over the [[question]] of [[women]] and [[children]].
it is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative,
as glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of the dialogue.
for [[example]], throughout the greater part of the sixth [[book]], the causes
of the [[corruption]] of [[philosophy]] and the conception of the [[idea]] of
good are discussed with adeimantus. then glaucon resumes his place
of principal respondent; but he has a difficulty in apprehending the
higher [[education]] of [[socrates]], and makes some false hits in the course
of the discussion. once more adeimantus returns with the allusion
to his [[brother]] glaucon whom he compares to the contentious [[state]];
in the next [[book]] he is again superseded, and glaucon continues to
the end. 

thus in a succession of characters [[character]] [[plato]] represents the successive
stages of morality, beginning with the athenian gentleman of the olden
time, who is followed by the practical [[man]] of that day regulating
his [[life]] by proverbs and saws; to him succeeds the wild generalization
of the sophists, and lastly come the [[young]] disciples of the great
teacher, who [[know]] the sophistical arguments but will not be convinced
by them, and [[desire]] to go deeper into the [[nature]] of things. these
too, like cephalus, polemarchus, thrasymachus, are clearly distinguished
from one another. neither in the [[republic]], nor in any other dialogue
of [[plato]], is a [[single]] [[character]] repeated. 

the delineation of [[socrates]] in the [[republic]] is not wholly consistent.
in the first [[book]] we have more of the real [[socrates]], such as he is
depicted in the memorabilia of xenophon, in the earliest dialogues
of [[plato]], and in the apology. he is ironical, provoking, questioning,
the old [[enemy]] of the sophists, ready to put on the mask of silenus
as well as to argue seriously. but in the sixth [[book]] his enmity towards
the sophists abates; he acknowledges that they are the representatives
rather than the corrupters of the [[world]]. he also becomes more dogmatic
and constructive, passing beyond the range either of the political
or the speculative ideas [[idea]] of the real [[socrates]]. in one passage plato
himself seems to intimate that the [[time]] had now come for [[socrates]],
who had passed his whole [[life]] in [[philosophy]], to give his own opinion
and not to be always repeating the notions of other [[men]]. there is
no evidence that either the [[idea]] of [[good]] or the conception of a perfect
state were comprehended in the socratic teaching, though he certainly
dwelt on the [[nature]] of the universal and of final causes (cp. xen.
mem. i. 4; phaedo 97); and a deep thinker like him in his thirty or
forty years of [[public]] teaching, could hardly have falled to touch
on the [[nature]] of [[family]] relations, for which there is also some positive
evidence in the memorabilia (mem. i. 2, 51 foll.) the socratic method
is nominally retained; and every inference is either put into the
mouth of the respondent or represented as the [[common]] discovery of
him and [[socrates]]. but any one can see that this is a mere form, of
which the affectation grows wearisome as the [[work]] advances. the method
of inquiry has passed into a method of teaching in which by the help
of interlocutors the same thesis is looked at from various points
of view. 

the [[nature]] of the process is truly characterized by glaucon, when
he describes himself as a companion who is not [[good]] for much in an
investigation, but can see what he is shown, and may, perhaps, give
the [[answer]] to a [[question]] more fluently than another. 

neither can we be absolutely [[certain]] that, [[socrates]] himself taught
the immortality of the [[soul]], which is unknown to his disciple glaucon
in the [[republic]]; nor is there any [[reason]] to suppose that he used myths
or revelations of another [[world]] as a vehicle of instruction, or that
he would have [[banished]] poetry or have denounced the [[greek]] mythology.
his favorite oath is retained, and a slight mention is made of the
daemonium, or internal sign, which is alluded to by [[socrates]] as a
phenomenon peculiar to himself. a real element of socratic teaching,
which is more prominent in the [[republic]] than in any of the other dialogues
of [[plato]], is the use of [[example]] and illustration ('taphorhtika auto
prhospherhontez'): "let us apply the test of [[common]] instances." "you,"
says adeimantus, ironically, in the sixth [[book]], "are so unaccustomed
to speak in images." and this use of examples [[example]] or images, though truly
socratic in origin, is enlarged by the genius of [[plato]] into the form
of an allegory or parable, which embodies in the concrete what has
been already described, or is about to be described, in the abstract.
thus the figure of the cave in [[book]] vii is a recapitulation of the
divisions of [[knowledge]] in [[book]] vi. the composite animal in [[book]] ix
is an allegory of the parts of the [[soul]]. the [[noble]] captain and the
ship and the true pilot in [[book]] vi are a figure of the relation of
the [[people]] to the [[philosophers]] in the [[state]] which has been described.
other figures, such as the dog in the second, third, and fourth books [[book]],
or the [[marriage]] of the portionless maiden in the sixth [[book]], or the
drones and wasps in the eighth and ninth books [[book]], also form links of
connection in long passages, or are used to recall previous discussions.

plato is most true to the [[character]] of his master when he describes
him as "not of this [[world]]." and with this representation of him the
ideal [[state]] and the other paradoxes of the [[republic]] are quite in accordance,
though they can not be shown to have been speculations of [[socrates]].
to him, as to other [[great]] teachers both philosophical and [[religious]],
when they looked upward, the [[world]] seemed to be the embodiment of
error and [[evil]]. the [[common]] sense of [[mankind]] has revolted against this
view, or has only partially admitted it. and even in [[socrates]] himself
the sterner [[judgment]] of the multitude at times [[time]] passes into a sort
of ironical [[pity]] or [[love]]. [[men]] in general are incapable of [[philosophy]],
and are therefore at enmity with the philosopher; but their misunderstanding
of him is unavoidable: for they have never seen him as he truly is
in his own image; they are only acquainted with artificial systems
possessing no native [[force]] of [[truth]] --words which admit of many applications.
their leaders have nothing to measure with, and are therefore ignorant
of their own stature. but they are to be pitied or laughed at, not
to be quarrelled with; they mean well with their nostrums, if they
could only learn that they are cutting off a hydra's head. this moderation
towards those who are in error is one of the most characteristic features
of [[socrates]] in the [[republic]]. in all the different representations
of [[socrates]], whether of xenophon or [[plato]], and the differences of
the earlier or later dialogues, he always retains the [[character]] of
the unwearied and disinterested seeker after [[truth]], without which
he would have ceased to be [[socrates]]. 

leaving the characters [[character]] we may now analyze the contents of the [[republic]],
and then proceed to consider (1) the general aspects of this hellenic
ideal of the [[state]], (2) the [[modern]] lights [[light]] in which the thoughts [[thought]] of
plato may be [[read]].

book i

socrates - glaucon 

i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the [[son]] of ariston,
that i might offer up my prayers to the [[goddess]]; and also because
i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival,
which was a new thing. i was delighted with the procession of the
inhabitants; but that of the thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful.
when we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned
in the direction of the [[city]]; and at that instant polemarchus the
son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we
were starting on our way [[home]], and told his servant to run and bid
us wait for him. the servant took hold of me by the cloak behind,
and said: polemarchus desires [[desire]] you to wait. 

i turned round, and [[asked]] him where his master was. 
there he is, said the [[youth]], coming after you, if you will only wait.

certainly we will, said glaucon; and in a few minutes polemarchus
appeared, and with him adeimantus, glaucon's [[brother]], niceratus the
son of nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.

socrates - polemarchus - glaucon - adeimantus 

polemarchus said to me: i perceive, [[socrates]], that you and our companion
are already on your way to the [[city]]. 

you are not far [[wrong]], i said. 
but do you see, he rejoined, how many we are? 
of course. 
and are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to
remain where you are. 

may there not be the alternative, i said, that we may persuade you
to let us go? 

but can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.

certainly not, replied glaucon. 
then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.

adeimantus added: has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback
in [[honour]] of the [[goddess]] which will take place in the evening?

with horses! i replied: that is a novelty. will horsemen carry torches
and pass them one to another during the [[race]]? 

yes, said polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will he celebrated
at night, which you certainly ought to see. let us rise soon after
supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of [[young]] [[men]],
and we will have a [[good]] talk. stay then, and do not be perverse.

glaucon said: i suppose, since you insist, that we must.

very [[good]], i replied. 

glaucon - cephalus - [[socrates]] 

accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house; and there we found
his brothers [[brother]] lysias and euthydemus, and with them thrasymachus the
chalcedonian, charmantides the paeanian, and cleitophon the [[son]] of
aristonymus. there too was cephalus the [[father]] of polemarchus, whom
i had not seen for a long [[time]], and i [[thought]] him very much aged.
he was seated on a cushioned chair, and had a garland on his head,
for he had been sacrificing in the court; and there were some other
chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle, upon which we sat down
by him. he saluted me eagerly, and then he said: -- 

you don't come to see me, [[socrates]], as often as you ought: if i were
still able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me. but
at my [[age]] i can hardly get to the [[city]], and therefore you should come
oftener to the piraeus. for let me tell you, that the more the pleasures
of the [[body]] fade away, the greater to me is the [[pleasure]] and charm
of conversation. do not then deny my request, but make our house your
resort and keep company with these [[young]] [[men]]; we are old [[friends]],
and you will be quite at [[home]] with us. 

i replied: there is nothing which for my part i like [[better]], cephalus,
than conversing with aged [[men]]; for i regard them as travellers who
have gone a [[journey]] which i too may have to go, and of whom i ought
to enquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult.
and this is a [[question]] which i should like to ask of you who have
arrived at that [[time]] which the poets call the 'threshold of old age'
--is [[life]] harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?

i will tell you, [[socrates]], he said, what my own feeling is. [[men]] of
my [[age]] flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb
says; and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is
--i cannot [[eat]], i cannot drink; the pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[youth]] and [[love]] are
fled away: there was a [[good]] [[time]] once, but now that is gone, and life
is no longer [[life]]. some [[complain]] of the slights which are put upon
them by relations, and they will tell you sadly of how many evils
their old [[age]] is the cause. but to me, [[socrates]], these complainers
seem to blame that which is not really in [[fault]]. for if old [[age]] were
the cause, i too being old, and every other old [[man]], would have felt
as they do. but this is not my own [[experience]], nor that of others
whom i have known. how well i [[remember]] the aged poet sophocles, when
in [[answer]] to the [[question]], how does [[love]] suit with [[age]], sophocles,
--are you still the [[man]] you were? [[peace]], he replied; most gladly have
i escaped the thing of which you speak; i [[feel]] as if i had escaped
from a mad and furious master. his words have often occurred to my
mind since, and they seem as [[good]] to me now as at the [[time]] when he
uttered them. for certainly old [[age]] has a [[great]] sense of calm and
freedom; when the [[passions]] relax their hold, then, as sophocles says,
we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only, but of many.
the [[truth]] is, [[socrates]], that these regrets, and also the complaints
about relations, are to be attributed to the same cause, which is
not old [[age]], but men's characters [[character]] and tempers; for he who is of a
calm and [[happy]] [[nature]] will hardly [[feel]] the pressure of [[age]], but to
him who is of an opposite disposition [[youth]] and [[age]] are equally a
burden. 

i listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might
go on --yes, cephalus, i said: but i rather suspect that [[people]] in
general are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they [[think]] that
old [[age]] sits lightly upon you, not because of your [[happy]] disposition,
but because you are [[rich]], and [[wealth]] is well known to be a [[great]] comforter.

you are [[right]], he replied; they are not convinced: and there is something
in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. i might answer
them as themistocles answered the seriphian who was abusing him and
saying that he was famous, not for his own merits [[merit]] but because he was
an athenian: 'if you had been a native of my [[country]] or i of yours,
neither of us would have been famous.' and to those who are not rich
and are impatient of old [[age]], the same reply may be made; for to the
good [[poor]] [[man]] old [[age]] cannot be a [[light]] burden, nor can a [[bad]] rich
man ever have [[peace]] with himself. 

may i ask, cephalus, whether your [[fortune]] was for the most part inherited
or acquired by you? 

acquired! [[socrates]]; do you want to [[know]] how much i acquired? in the
art of making [[money]] i have been midway between my [[father]] and grandfather:
for my grandfather, whose name i bear, doubled and trebled the value
of his patrimony, that which he inherited being much what i possess
now; but my [[father]] lysanias reduced the [[property]] below what it is
at [[present]]: and i shall be satisfied if i leave to these my sons [[son]] not
less but a little more than i received. 

that was why i [[asked]] you the [[question]], i replied, because i see that
you are indifferent about [[money]], which is a characteristic rather
of those who have inherited their fortunes [[fortune]] than of those who have
acquired them; the makers of fortunes [[fortune]] have a second [[love]] of money
as a creation of their own, resembling the affection of authors for
their own poems, or of parents for their [[children]], besides that natural
love of it for the sake of use and [[profit]] which is [[common]] to them
and all [[men]]. and hence they are very [[bad]] company, for they can talk
about nothing but the praises [[praise]] of [[wealth]]. that is true, he said.

yes, that is very true, but may i ask another [[question]]? what do you
consider to be the [[greatest]] blessing which you have reaped from your
wealth? 

one, he said, of which i could not expect easily to convince others.
for let me tell you, [[socrates]], that when a [[man]] thinks [[think]] himself to be
near [[death]], fears [[fear]] and cares [[care]] enter into his [[mind]] which he never had
before; the tales of a [[world]] below and the [[punishment]] which is exacted
there of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now
he is tormented with the [[thought]] that they may be true: either from
the weakness of [[age]], or because he is now drawing nearer to that other
place, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms
crowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what
wrongs he has done to others. and when he finds that the sum of his
transgressions is [[great]] he will many a [[time]] like a child start up
in his sleep for [[fear]], and he is filled with dark forebodings. but
to him who is conscious of no [[sin]], sweet [[hope]], as pindar charmingly
says, is the [[kind]] nurse of his [[age]]: 

hope, he says, cherishes the [[soul]] of him who lives [[life]] in [[justice]] and
holiness and is the nurse of his [[age]] and the companion of his [[journey]];
--hope which is mightiest to sway the restless [[soul]] of [[man]].

how admirable are his words! and the [[great]] blessing of riches [[rich]], i do
not say to every [[man]], but to a [[good]] [[man]], is, that he has had no occasion
to [[deceive]] or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally;
and when he departs to the [[world]] below he is not in any apprehension
about offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to [[men]]. now
to this [[peace]] of [[mind]] the possession of [[wealth]] greatly contributes;
and therefore i say, that, setting one thing against another, of the
many advantages which [[wealth]] has to give, to a [[man]] of sense this is
in my [[opinion]] the [[greatest]]. 

well said, cephalus, i replied; but as concerning [[justice]], what is
it? --to speak the [[truth]] and to [[pay]] your debts --no more than this?
and even to this are there not exceptions? suppose that a friend when
in his [[right]] [[mind]] has deposited arms with me and he asks for them
when he is not in his [[right]] [[mind]], ought i to give them back to him?
no one would say that i ought or that i should be [[right]] in doing so,
any more than they would say that i ought always to speak the truth
to one who is in his condition. 

you are quite [[right]], he replied. 
but then, i said, speaking the [[truth]] and paying your debts is not
a [[correct]] definition of [[justice]]. 

cephalus - [[socrates]] - polemarchus 

quite [[correct]], [[socrates]], if simonides is to be believed, said polemarchus
interposing. 

i [[fear]], said cephalus, that i must go now, for i have to look after
the sacrifices [[sacrifice]], and i hand over the argument to polemarchus and the
company. 

is not polemarchus your heir? i said. 
to be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the sacrifices [[sacrifice]].

socrates - polemarchus 

tell me then, o thou heir of the argument, what did simonides say,
and according to you truly say, about [[justice]]? 

he said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he
appears to me to be [[right]]. 

i should be [[sorry]] to [[doubt]] the word of such a [[wise]] and inspired [[man]],
but his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear
to me. for he certainly does not mean, as we were now saying that
i ought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else to
one who asks for it when he is not in his [[right]] senses; and yet a
deposit cannot be denied to be a debt. 

true. 
then when the [[person]] who asks me is not in his [[right]] [[mind]] i am by
no means to make the return? 

certainly not. 
when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was [[justice]], he did
not mean to include that case? 

certainly not; for he thinks [[think]] that a friend ought always to do good
to a friend and never [[evil]]. 

you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury
of the receiver, if the two parties are [[friends]], is not the repayment
of a debt, --that is what you would imagine him to say? 

yes. 
and are enemies [[enemy]] also to receive what we owe to them? 
to be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an
enemy, as i take it, owes to an [[enemy]] that which is due or proper
to him --that is to say, [[evil]]. 

simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken
darkly of the [[nature]] of [[justice]]; for he really meant to say that justice
is the giving to each [[man]] what is proper to him, and this he termed
a debt. 

that must have been his meaning, he said. 
by heaven! i replied; and if we [[asked]] him what due or proper thing
is given by medicine, and to whom, what [[answer]] do you [[think]] that he
would make to us? 

he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink
to [[human]] bodies [[body]]. 

and what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?

seasoning to food. 
and what is that which [[justice]] gives, and to whom? 
if, [[socrates]], we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding
instances, then [[justice]] is the art [[arts]] which gives [[good]] to [[friends]] and
evil to enemies [[enemy]]. 

that is his meaning then? 
i [[think]] so. 
and who is [[best]] able to do [[good]] to his [[friends]] and [[evil]] to his enemies
in [[time]] of sickness? 

the physician. 
or when they are on a [[voyage]], amid the perils of the sea?

the pilot. 
and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just
man most able to do harm to his [[enemy]] and [[good]] to his [[friends]]?

in going to [[war]] against the one and in making alliances with the other.

but when a [[man]] is well, my dear polemarchus, there is no need of a
physician? 

no. 
and he who is not on a [[voyage]] has no need of a pilot? 
no. 
then in [[time]] of [[peace]] [[justice]] will be of no use? 
i am very far from thinking so. 
you [[think]] that [[justice]] may be of use in [[peace]] as well as in [[war]]?

yes. 
like husbandry for the acquisition of corn? 
yes. 
or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes, --that is what you
mean? 

yes. 
and what similar use or [[power]] of acquisition has [[justice]] in [[time]] of
peace? 

in contracts, [[socrates]], [[justice]] is of use. 
and by contracts you mean partnerships? 
exactly. 
but is the just [[man]] or the skilful player a more useful and better
partner at a game of draughts? 

the skilful player. 
and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just [[man]] a more useful
or [[better]] partner than the builder? 

quite the reverse. 
then in what sort of partnership is the just [[man]] a [[better]] partner
than the harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly
a [[better]] partner than the just [[man]]? 

in a [[money]] partnership. 
yes, polemarchus, but surely not in the use of [[money]]; for you do not
want a just [[man]] to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a horse;
a [[man]] who is knowing about horses would be [[better]] for that, would
he not? 

certainly. 
and when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would
be [[better]]? 

true. 
then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man
is to be preferred? 

when you want a deposit to be kept safely. 
you mean when [[money]] is not wanted, but allowed to [[lie]]? 
precisely. 
that is to say, [[justice]] is useful when [[money]] is useless?

that is the inference. 
and when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then [[justice]] is useful
to the [[individual]] and to the [[state]]; but when you want to use it, then
the art [[arts]] of the vine-dresser? 

clearly. 
and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them,
you would say that [[justice]] is useful; but when you want to use them,
then the art [[arts]] of the soldier or of the musician? 

certainly. 
and so of all the other things; --justice is useful when they are
useless, and useless when they are useful? 

that is the inference. 
then [[justice]] is not [[good]] for much. but let us consider this further
point: is not he who can [[best]] strike a blow in a boxing match or in
any [[kind]] of fighting [[best]] able to ward off a blow? 

certainly. 
and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease
is [[best]] able to create one? 

true. 
and he is the [[best]] guard of a camp who is [[best]] able to steal a march
upon the [[enemy]]? 

certainly. 
then he who is a [[good]] keeper of anything is also a [[good]] thief?

that, i suppose, is to be inferred. 
then if the just [[man]] is [[good]] at keeping [[money]], he is [[good]] at stealing
it. 

that is implied in the argument. 
then after all the just [[man]] has turned out to be a thief. and this
is a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of [[homer]]; for
he, speaking of autolycus, the maternal grandfather of odysseus, who
is a favourite of his, affirms that 

he was excellent above all [[men]] in theft and perjury. and so, you and
homer and simonides are agreed that [[justice]] is an art [[arts]] of theft; to
be practised however 'for the [[good]] of [[friends]] and for the harm of
enemies,' --that was what you were saying? 

no, certainly not that, though i do not now [[know]] what i did say; but
i still stand by the latter words. 

well, there is another [[question]]: by [[friends]] and enemies [[enemy]] do we mean
those who are so really, or only in seeming? 

surely, he said, a [[man]] may be expected to [[love]] those whom he thinks
good, and to hate those whom he thinks [[think]] [[evil]]. 

yes, but do not persons [[person]] often err about [[good]] and [[evil]]: many who are
not [[good]] seem to be so, and conversely? 

that is true. 
then to them the [[good]] will be enemies [[enemy]] and the [[evil]] will be their [[friends]]?
true. 

and in that case they will be [[right]] in doing [[good]] to the [[evil]] and
evil to the [[good]]? 

clearly. 
but the [[good]] are just and would not do an [[injustice]]? 
true. 
then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do
no [[wrong]]? 

nay, [[socrates]]; the doctrine is immoral. 
then i suppose that we ought to do [[good]] to the just and harm to the
unjust? 

i like that [[better]]. 
but see the consequence: --many a [[man]] who is ignorant of [[human]] nature
has [[friends]] who are [[bad]] [[friends]], and in that case he ought to do harm
to them; and he has [[good]] enemies [[enemy]] whom he ought to benefit; but, if
so, we shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed
to be the meaning of simonides. 

very true, he said: and i [[think]] that we had [[better]] [[correct]] an error
into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend'
and 'enemy.' 

what was the error, polemarchus? i [[asked]]. 
we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is [[thought]] [[good]].

and how is the error to be corrected? 
we should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems,
good; and that he who seems only, and is not [[good]], only seems to be
and is not a friend; and of an [[enemy]] the same may be said.

you would argue that the [[good]] are our [[friends]] and the [[bad]] our enemies [[enemy]]?

yes. 
and instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to
do [[good]] to our [[friends]] and harm to our enemies [[enemy]], we should further
say: it is just to do [[good]] to our [[friends]] when they are [[good]] and harm
to our enemies [[enemy]] when they are [[evil]]? 

yes, that appears to me to be the [[truth]]. 
but ought the just to injure any one at all? 
undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his enemies [[enemy]].

when horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?

the latter. 
deteriorated, that is to say, in the [[good]] qualities of horses, not
of dogs? 

yes, of horses. 
and dogs are deteriorated in the [[good]] qualities of dogs, and not of
horses? 

of course. 
and will not [[men]] who are injured be deteriorated in that which is
the proper [[virtue]] of [[man]]? 

certainly. 
and that [[human]] [[virtue]] is [[justice]]? 
to be sure. 
then [[men]] who are injured are of necessity made [[unjust]]? 
that is the result. 
but can the musician by his art [[arts]] make [[men]] unmusical? 
certainly not. 
or the horseman by his art [[arts]] make them [[bad]] horsemen? 
impossible. 
and can the just by [[justice]] make [[men]] [[unjust]], or speaking general can
the [[good]] by [[virtue]] make them [[bad]]? 

assuredly not. 
any more than heat can [[produce]] cold? 
it cannot. 
or drought moisture? 
clearly not. 
nor can the [[good]] harm any one? 
impossible. 
and the just is the [[good]]? 
certainly. 
then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just [[man]],
but of the opposite, who is the [[unjust]]? 

i [[think]] that what you say is quite true, [[socrates]]. 
then if a [[man]] says that [[justice]] consists in the repayment of debts,
and that [[good]] is the debt which a [[man]] owes to his [[friends]], and evil
the debt which he owes to his enemies [[enemy]], --to say this is not [[wise]];
for it is not true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of
another can be in no case just. 

i agree with you, said polemarchus. 
then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes
such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus, or any other wise
man or seer? 

i am quite ready to do [[battle]] at your side, he said. 
shall i tell you whose i [[believe]] the saying to be? 
whose? 
i [[believe]] that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias the theban,
or some other [[rich]] and mighty [[man]], who had a [[great]] [[opinion]] of his
own [[power]], was the first to say that [[justice]] is 'doing [[good]] to your
friends and harm to your enemies [[enemy]].' 

most true, he said. 
yes, i said; but if this definition of [[justice]] also breaks down, what
other can be offered? 

several times [[time]] in the course of the discussion thrasymachus had made
an attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put
down by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. but when
polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause, he could
no longer hold his [[peace]]; and, gathering himself up, he came at us
like a wild beast, seeking to devour us. we were quite panic-stricken
at the sight of him. 

socrates - polemarchus - thrasymachus 

he roared out to the whole company: what folly. [[socrates]], has taken
possession of you all? and why, sillybillies, do you knock under to
one another? i say that if you want really to [[know]] what [[justice]] is,
you should not only ask but [[answer]], and you should not seek honour
to yourself from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own
answer; for there is many a one who can ask and cannot [[answer]]. and
now i will not have you say that [[justice]] is [[duty]] or advantage or profit
or gain or interest, for this sort of nonsense will not do for me;
i must have clearness and accuracy. 

i was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without
trembling. indeed i [[believe]] that if i had not fixed my eye upon him,
i should have been struck dumb: but when i saw his fury rising, i
looked at him first, and was therefore able to reply to him.

thrasymachus, i said, with a quiver, don't be hard upon us. polemarchus
and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but
i can assure you that the error was not intentional. if we were seeking
for a piece of gold, you would not imagine that we were 'knocking
under to one another,' and so losing our [[chance]] of finding it. and
why, when we are seeking for [[justice]], a thing more precious than many
pieces of gold, do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another
and not doing our utmost to get at the [[truth]]? nay, my [[good]] friend,
we are most willing and anxious to do so, but the [[fact]] is that we
cannot. and if so, you [[people]] who [[know]] all things should [[pity]] us and
not be angry with us. 

how characteristic of socrates! he replied, with a bitter laugh; --that's
your ironical style! did i not foresee --have i not already told you,
that whatever he was [[asked]] he would refuse to [[answer]], and try irony
or any other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?

you are a philosopher, thrasymachus, i replied, and well [[know]] that
if you ask a [[person]] what numbers make up twelve, taking [[care]] to prohibit
him whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times [[time]] four, or
six times [[time]] two, or four times [[time]] three, 'for this sort of nonsense will
not do for me,' --then obviously, that is your way of putting the
question, no one can [[answer]] you. but suppose that he were to retort,
'thrasymachus, what do you mean? if one of these numbers which you
interdict be the true [[answer]] to the [[question]], am i falsely to say
some other number which is not the [[right]] one? --is that your meaning?'
-how would you [[answer]] him? 

just as if the two cases were at all alike! he said. 
why should they not be? i replied; and even if they are not, but only
appear to be so to the [[person]] who is [[asked]], ought he not to say what
he thinks [[think]], whether you and i forbid him or not? 

i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers [[answer]]?

i dare say that i may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection
i approve of any of them. 

but what if i give you an [[answer]] about [[justice]] other and [[better]], he
said, than any of these? what do you deserve to have done to you?

done to me! --as becomes the ignorant, i must learn from the wise
--that is what i deserve to have done to me. 

what, and no payment! a pleasant notion! 
i will [[pay]] when i have the [[money]], i replied. 

socrates - thrasymachus - glaucon 

but you have, [[socrates]], said glaucon: and you, thrasymachus, need
be under no [[anxiety]] about [[money]], for we will all make a contribution
for [[socrates]]. 

yes, he replied, and then [[socrates]] will do as he always does --refuse
to [[answer]] himself, but take and pull to pieces the [[answer]] of some
one else. 

why, my [[good]] friend, i said, how can any one [[answer]] who knows [[know]], and
says that he knows [[know]], just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint
notions of his own, is told by a [[man]] of [[authority]] not to utter them?
the [[natural]] thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself
who professes to [[know]] and can tell what he knows [[know]]. will you then kindly
answer, for the edification of the company and of myself ?

glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and thrasymachus,
as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he thought
that he had an excellent [[answer]], and would distinguish himself. but
at first he to insist on my answering; at length he consented to begin.
behold, he said, the [[wisdom]] of [[socrates]]; he refuses to [[teach]] himself,
and goes about learning of others, to whom he never even says thank
you. 

that i learn of others, i replied, is quite true; but that i am ungrateful
i wholly deny. [[money]] i have none, and therefore i [[pay]] in [[praise]], which
is all i have: and how ready i am to [[praise]] any one who appears to
me to speak well you will very soon find out when you [[answer]]; for
i expect that you will [[answer]] well. 

listen, then, he said; i proclaim that [[justice]] is nothing else than
the interest of the stronger. and now why do you not me? but of course
you won't. 

let me first [[understand]] you, i replied. [[justice]], as you say, is the
interest of the stronger. what, thrasymachus, is the meaning of this?
you cannot mean to say that because polydamas, the pancratiast, is
stronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his
bodily [[strength]], that to [[eat]] beef is therefore equally for our good
who are weaker than he is, and [[right]] and just for us? 

that's abominable of you, [[socrates]]; you take the words in the sense
which is most damaging to the argument. 

not at all, my [[good]] sir, i said; i am trying to [[understand]] them; and
i [[wish]] that you would be a little clearer. 

well, he said, have you never heard that forms of [[government]] differ;
there are tyrannies, and there are democracies [[democracy]], and there are aristocracies?

yes, i [[know]]. 
and the [[government]] is the ruling [[power]] in each [[state]]? 
certainly. 
and the different forms of [[government]] make laws [[law]] democratical, aristocratical,
tyrannical, with a view to their several interests; and these laws [[law]],
which are made by them for their own interests, are the [[justice]] which
they deliver to their subjects [[subject]], and him who transgresses them they
punish as a breaker of the [[law]], and [[unjust]]. and that is what i mean
when i say that in all states there is the same [[principle]] of [[justice]],
which is the interest of the [[government]]; and as the [[government]] must
be supposed to have [[power]], the only reasonable conclusion is, that
everywhere there is one [[principle]] of [[justice]], which is the interest
of the stronger. 

now i [[understand]] you, i said; and whether you are [[right]] or not i will
try to discover. but let me remark, that in defining [[justice]] you have
yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. it
is true, however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger'
are added. 

a small addition, you must allow, he said. 
great or small, never [[mind]] about that: we must first enquire whether
what you are saying is the [[truth]]. now we are both agreed that justice
is interest of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the stronger';
about this addition i am not so sure, and must therefore consider
further. 

proceed. 
i will; and first tell me, do you admit that it is just or subjects
to obey their rulers? 

i do. 
but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they sometimes
liable to err? 

to be sure, he replied, they are liable to err. 
then in making their laws [[law]] they may sometimes make them rightly, and
sometimes not? 

true. 
when they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest;
when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit that?

yes. 
and the laws [[law]] which they make must be obeyed by their subjects [[subject]], --and
that is what you call [[justice]]? 

doubtless. 
then [[justice]], according to your argument, is not only [[obedience]] to
the interest of the stronger but the reverse? 

what is that you are saying? he [[asked]]. 
i am only repeating what you are saying, i [[believe]]. but let us consider:
have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own
interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is [[justice]]?
has not that been admitted? 

yes. 
then you must also have acknowledged [[justice]] not to be for the interest
of the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to
be done which are to their own injury. for if, as you say, justice
is the [[obedience]] which the [[subject]] renders to their commands, in that
case, o wisest of [[men]], is there any escape from the conclusion that
the weaker are commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but
what is for the injury of the stronger? 

nothing can be clearer, [[socrates]], said polemarchus. 

socrates - cleitophon - polemarchus - thrasymachus 

yes, said cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his witness.

but there is no need of any witness, said polemarchus, for thrasymachus
himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not
for their own interest, and that for subjects [[subject]] to obey them is [[justice]].

yes, polemarchus, --thrasymachus said that for subjects [[subject]] to do what
was commanded by their rulers is just. 

yes, cleitophon, but he also said that [[justice]] is the interest of
the stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further
acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his
subjects to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that
justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.

but, said cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what
the stronger [[thought]] to be his interest, --this was what the weaker
had to do; and this was affirmed by him to be [[justice]]. 

those were not his words, rejoined polemarchus. 

socrates - thrasymachus 

never [[mind]], i replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept
his statement. tell me, thrasymachus, i said, did you mean by justice
what the stronger [[thought]] to be his interest, whether really so or
not? 

certainly not, he said. do you suppose that i call him who is mistaken
the stronger at the [[time]] when he is mistaken? 

yes, i said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted
that the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.

you argue like an informer, [[socrates]]. do you mean, for [[example]], that
he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?
or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or
grammarian at the me when he is making the mistake, in [[respect]] of
the mistake? true, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian
has made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact
is that neither the grammarian nor any other [[person]] of [[skill]] ever
makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none
of them err unless their [[skill]] fails them, and then they cease to
be skilled artists. no artist or sage or ruler errs at the [[time]] when
he is what his name implies; though he is commonly said to err, and
i adopted the [[common]] mode of speaking. but to be perfectly accurate,
since you are such a lover of accuracy, we should say that the ruler,
in so far as he is the ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring, always
commands that which is for his own interest; and the [[subject]] is required
to execute his commands; and therefore, as i said at first and now
repeat, [[justice]] is the interest of the stronger. 

indeed, thrasymachus, and do i really appear to you to argue like
an informer? 

certainly, he replied. 
and you suppose that i ask these questions [[question]] with any design of injuring
you in the argument? 

nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word --i [[know]] it; but you will
be found out, and by sheer [[force]] of argument you will never prevail.

i shall not make the attempt, my dear [[man]]; but to avoid any misunderstanding
occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what sense do you speak
of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were saying, he being
the superior, it is just that the inferior should execute --is he
a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the term?

in the strictest of all senses, he said. and now [[cheat]] and play the
informer if you can; i ask no quarter at your hands. but you never
will be able, never. 

and do you imagine, i said, that i am such a madman as to try and
cheat, thrasymachus? i might as well shave a lion. 

why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.

enough, i said, of these civilities. it will be [[better]] that i should
ask you a [[question]]: is the physician, taken in that strict sense of
which you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of [[money]]?
and [[remember]] that i am now speaking of the true physician.

a healer of the sick, he replied. 
and the pilot --that is to say, the true pilot --is he a captain of
sailors or a mere sailor? 

a captain of sailors. 
the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into
account; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which
he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant
of his [[skill]] and of his [[authority]] over the sailors. 

very true, he said. 
now, i said, every art [[arts]] has an interest? 
certainly. 
for which the art [[arts]] has to consider and provide? 
yes, that is the aim of art [[arts]]. 
and the interest of any art [[arts]] is the [[perfection]] of it --this and nothing
else? 

what do you mean? 
i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the [[example]] of the [[body]].
suppose you were to ask me whether the [[body]] is self-sufficing or has
wants, i should reply: certainly the [[body]] has wants; for the body
may be ill and require to be cured, and has therefore interests to
which the art [[arts]] of medicine ministers; and this is the origin and intention
of medicine, as you will acknowledge. am i not [[right]]? 

quite [[right]], he replied. 
but is the art [[arts]] of medicine or any other art [[arts]] faulty or deficient in
any quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight
or the ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art [[arts]] to
provide for the interests of seeing and hearing --has art [[arts]] in itself,
i say, any similar liability to [[fault]] or defect, and does every art
require another supplementary art [[arts]] to provide for its interests, and
that another and another without end? or have the [[arts]] to look only
after their own interests? or have they no need either of themselves
or of another? --having no faults [[fault]] or defects, they have no need to
correct them, either by the exercise of their own art [[arts]] or of any other;
they have only to consider the interest of their subject-matter. for
every art [[arts]] remains pure and faultless while remaining true --that is
to say, while [[perfect]] and unimpaired. take the words in your precise
sense, and tell me whether i am not [[right]]." 

yes, clearly. 
then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the
interest of the [[body]]? 

true, he said. 
nor does the art [[arts]] of horsemanship consider the interests of the art
of horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other
arts [[care]] for themselves, for they have no needs; they [[care]] only for
that which is the [[subject]] of their art [[arts]]? 

true, he said. 
but surely, thrasymachus, the [[arts]] are the superiors and rulers of
their own subjects [[subject]]? 

to this he assented with a [[good]] deal of reluctance. 
then, i said, no [[science]] or art [[arts]] considers or enjoins the interest
of the stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject
and weaker? 

he made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally acquiesced.

then, i continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician, considers
his own [[good]] in what he prescribes, but the [[good]] of his patient; for
the true physician is also a ruler having the [[human]] [[body]] as a [[subject]],
and is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted? 

yes. 
and the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler
of sailors and not a mere sailor? 

that has been admitted. 
and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest
of the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler's
interest? 

he gave a reluctant 'yes.' 
then, i said, thrasymachus, there is no one in any [[rule]] who, in so
far as he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest,
but always what is for the interest of his [[subject]] or suitable to
his art [[arts]]; to that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything
which he says and does. 

when we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw that
the definition of [[justice]] had been completely upset, thrasymachus,
instead of replying to me, said: tell me, [[socrates]], have you got a
nurse? 

why do you ask such a [[question]], i said, when you ought rather to be
answering? 

because she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she has
not even taught you to [[know]] the shepherd from the sheep.

what makes you say that? i replied. 
because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends the
sheep or oxen with a view to their own [[good]] and not to the [[good]] of
himself or his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of
states, if they are true rulers, never [[think]] of their subjects [[subject]] as
sheep, and that they are not studying their own advantage day and
night. oh, no; and so entirely astray are you in your ideas [[idea]] about
the just and [[unjust]] as not even to [[know]] that [[justice]] and the just
are in reality another's [[good]]; that is to say, the interest of the
ruler and stronger, and the loss of the [[subject]] and servant; and injustice
the opposite; for the [[unjust]] is [[lord]] over the truly simple and just:
he is the stronger, and his subjects [[subject]] do what is for his interest,
and minister to his [[happiness]], which is very far from being their
own. consider further, most foolish [[socrates]], that the just is always
a loser in comparison with the [[unjust]]. first of all, in private contracts:
wherever the [[unjust]] is the partner of the just you will find that,
when the partnership is dissolved, the [[unjust]] [[man]] has always more
and the just less. secondly, in their dealings with the [[state]]: when
there is an income tax, the just [[man]] will [[pay]] more and the unjust
less on the same amount of income; and when there is anything to be
received the one gains nothing and the other much. observe also what
happens when they take an office; there is the just [[man]] neglecting
his affairs and perhaps suffering other losses, and getting nothing
out of the [[public]], because he is just; moreover he is hated by his
friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways.
but all this is reversed in the case of the [[unjust]] [[man]]. i am speaking,
as before, of [[injustice]] on a large scale in which the advantage of
the [[unjust]] is more apparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen
if we turn to that highest form of [[injustice]] in which the criminal
is the happiest of [[men]], and the sufferers or those who refuse to do
injustice are the most miserable --that is to say [[tyranny]], which by
fraud and [[force]] takes away the [[property]] of others, not little by little
but wholesale; comprehending in one, things [[sacred]] as well as profane,
private and [[public]]; for which acts of [[wrong]], if he were detected perpetrating
any one of them singly, he would be punished and incur [[great]] disgrace
--they who do such [[wrong]] in particular cases are called robbers of
temples, and man-stealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves.
but when a [[man]] besides taking away the [[money]] of the [[citizens]] has made
slaves of them, then, instead of these names of reproach, he is termed
happy and blessed, not only by the [[citizens]] but by all who hear of
his having achieved the consummation of [[injustice]]. for [[mankind]] censure
injustice, fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because
they shrink from committing it. and thus, as i have shown, [[socrates]],
injustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more [[strength]] and freedom
and mastery than [[justice]]; and, as i said at first, [[justice]] is the
interest of the stronger, whereas [[injustice]] is a man's [[man]] own profit
and interest. 

thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bathman, deluged
our ears with his words, had a [[mind]] to go away. but the company would
not let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his position;
and i myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us.
thrasymachus, i said to him, excellent [[man]], how suggestive are your
remarks! and are you going to run away before you have fairly taught
or learned whether they are true or not? is the attempt to determine
the way of man's [[man]] [[life]] so small a matter in your [[eyes]] --to determine
how [[life]] may be passed by each one of us to the [[greatest]] advantage?

and do i differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?

you appear rather, i replied, to have no [[care]] or [[thought]] about us,
thrasymachus --whether we [[live]] [[better]] or worse from not knowing what
you say you [[know]], is to you a matter of indifference. prithee, friend,
do not keep your [[knowledge]] to yourself; we are a large party; and
any benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. for my
own part i openly declare that i am not convinced, and that i do not
believe [[injustice]] to be more gainful than [[justice]], even if uncontrolled
and allowed to have [[free]] play. for, granting that there may be an
unjust [[man]] who is able to commit [[injustice]] either by fraud or [[force]],
still this does not convince me of the superior advantage of [[injustice]],
and there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself.
perhaps we may be [[wrong]]; if so, you in your [[wisdom]] should convince
us that we are mistaken in preferring [[justice]] to [[injustice]].

and how am i to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced
by what i have just said; what more can i do for you? would you have
me put the proof bodily into your souls [[soul]]? 

heaven forbid! i said; i would only ask you to be consistent; or,
if you [[change]], [[change]] openly and let there be no deception. for i
must remark, thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously
said, that although you began by defining the true physician in an
exact sense, you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of
the shepherd; you [[thought]] that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the
sheep not with a view to their own [[good]], but like a mere diner or
banqueter with a view to the pleasures [[pleasure]] of the table; or, again, as
a trader for sale in the market, and not as a shepherd. yet surely
the art [[arts]] of the shepherd is concerned only with the [[good]] of his subjects [[subject]];
he has only to provide the [[best]] for them, since the [[perfection]] of
the art [[arts]] is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it are
satisfied. and that was what i was saying just now about the ruler.
i conceived that the art [[arts]] of the ruler, considered as ruler, whether
in a [[state]] or in private [[life]], could only regard the [[good]] of his flock
or subjects [[subject]]; whereas you seem to [[think]] that the rulers in states,
that is to say, the true rulers, like being in [[authority]].

think! nay, i am sure of it. 
then why in the case of lesser offices do [[men]] never take them willingly
without payment, unless under the [[idea]] that they govern for the advantage
not of themselves but of others? let me ask you a [[question]]: are not
the several [[arts]] different, by [[reason]] of their each having a separate
function? and, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you [[think]],
that we may make a little [[progress]]. 

yes, that is the difference, he replied. 
and each art [[arts]] gives us a particular [[good]] and not merely a general one
--medicine, for [[example]], gives us health; navigation, safety at sea,
and so on? 

yes, he said. 
and the art [[arts]] of payment has the special function of giving [[pay]]: but
we do not confuse this with other [[arts]], any more than the art [[arts]] of the
pilot is to be confused with the art [[arts]] of medicine, because the health
of the pilot may be improved by a sea [[voyage]]. you would not be inclined
to say, would you, that navigation is the art [[arts]] of medicine, at least
if we are to adopt your exact use of [[language]]? 

certainly not. 
or because a [[man]] is in [[good]] health when he receives [[pay]] you would
not say that the art [[arts]] of payment is medicine? 

i should say not. 
nor would you say that medicine is the art [[arts]] of receiving [[pay]] because
a [[man]] takes fees when he is engaged in healing? 

certainly not. 
and we have admitted, i said, that the [[good]] of each art [[arts]] is specially
confined to the art [[arts]]? 

yes. 
then, if there be any [[good]] which all artists have in [[common]], that
is to be attributed to something of which they all have the common
use? 

true, he replied. 
and when the artist is benefited by receiving [[pay]] the advantage is
gained by an additional use of the art [[arts]] of [[pay]], which is not the art
professed by him? 

he gave a reluctant assent to this. 
then the [[pay]] is not derived by the several artists from their respective
arts. but the [[truth]] is, that while the art [[arts]] of medicine gives health,
and the art [[arts]] of the builder builds a house, another art [[arts]] attends them
which is the art [[arts]] of [[pay]]. the various [[arts]] may be doing their own business
and benefiting that over which they preside, but would the artist
receive any benefit from his art [[arts]] unless he were paid as well?

i suppose not. 
but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works [[work]] for nothing?

certainly, he confers a benefit. 
then now, thrasymachus, there is no longer any [[doubt]] that neither
arts nor governments [[government]] provide for their own interests; but, as we were
before saying, they [[rule]] and provide for the interests of their subjects
who are the weaker and not the stronger --to their [[good]] they attend
and not to the [[good]] of the superior. 

and this is the [[reason]], my dear thrasymachus, why, as i was just now
saying, no one is willing to govern; because no one likes to take
in hand the reformation of evils [[evil]] which are not his concern without
remuneration. for, in the execution of his [[work]], and in giving his
orders to another, the true artist does not regard his own interest,
but always that of his subjects [[subject]]; and therefore in order that rulers
may be willing to [[rule]], they must be paid in one of three modes of
payment: [[money]], or [[honour]], or a penalty for refusing. 

socrates - glaucon 

what do you mean, [[socrates]]? said glaucon. the first two modes of payment
are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is i do not [[understand]],
or how a penalty can be a payment. 

you mean that you do not [[understand]] the [[nature]] of this payment which
to the [[best]] [[men]] is the [[great]] inducement to [[rule]]? of course you know
that [[ambition]] and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?

very true. 
and for this [[reason]], i said, [[money]] and [[honour]] have no attraction for
them; [[good]] [[men]] do not [[wish]] to be openly demanding payment for governing
and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves
out of the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]] to get the name of thieves. and not being
ambitious they do not [[care]] about [[honour]]. wherefore necessity must
be laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear
of [[punishment]]. and this, as i imagine, is the [[reason]] why the forwardness
to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed
dishonourable. now the worst part of the [[punishment]] is that he who
refuses to [[rule]] is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.
and the [[fear]] of this, as i conceive, induces the [[good]] to take office,
not because they would, but because they cannot [[help]] --not under the
idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves,
but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task
of ruling to any one who is [[better]] than themselves, or indeed as [[good]].
for there is [[reason]] to [[think]] that if a [[city]] were composed entirely
of [[good]] [[men]], then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention
as to obtain office is at [[present]]; then we should have plain proof
that the true ruler is not meant by [[nature]] to regard his own interest,
but that of his subjects [[subject]]; and every one who knew this would choose
rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble
of conferring one. so far am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that
justice is the interest of the stronger. this latter [[question]] need
not be further discussed at [[present]]; but when thrasymachus says that
the [[life]] of the [[unjust]] is more advantageous than that of the just,
his new statement appears to me to be of a far more serious [[character]].
which of us has spoken truly? and which sort of [[life]], glaucon, do
you prefer? 

i for my part deem the [[life]] of the just to be the more advantageous,
he answered. 

did you hear all the advantages of the [[unjust]] which thrasymachus was
rehearsing? 

yes, i heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.

then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that
he is saying what is not true? 

most certainly, he replied. 
if, i said, he makes a set [[speech]] and we make another recounting all
the advantages of being just, and he answers [[answer]] and we rejoin, there
must be a numbering and measuring of the goods [[good]] which are claimed on
either side, and in the end we shall want judges [[judge]] to decide; but if
we proceed in our enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to
one another, we shall unite the offices of [[judge]] and advocate in our
own persons [[person]]. 

very [[good]], he said. 
and which method do i [[understand]] you to prefer? i said. 
that which you propose. 
well, then, thrasymachus, i said, suppose you begin at the beginning
and [[answer]] me. you say that [[perfect]] [[injustice]] is more gainful than
perfect [[justice]]? 

socrates - glaucon - thrasymachus 

yes, that is what i say, and i have given you my reasons [[reason]].

and what is your view about them? would you call one of them virtue
and the other [[vice]]? 

certainly. 
i suppose that you would call [[justice]] [[virtue]] and [[injustice]] [[vice]]?

what a charming notion! so likely too, seeing that i affirm injustice
to be profitable and [[justice]] not. 

what else then would you say? 
the opposite, he replied. 
and would you call [[justice]] [[vice]]? 
no, i would rather say sublime simplicity. 
then would you call [[injustice]] malignity? 
no; i would rather say discretion. 
and do the [[unjust]] appear to you to be [[wise]] and [[good]]? 
yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly
unjust, and who have the [[power]] of subduing states and nations; but
perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses. 

even this profession if undetected has advantages, though they are
not to be compared with those of which i was just now speaking.

i do not [[think]] that i misapprehend your meaning, thrasymachus, i replied;
but still i cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice
with [[wisdom]] and [[virtue]], and [[justice]] with the opposite. 

certainly i do so class them. 
now, i said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground;
for if the [[injustice]] which you were maintaining to be profitable had
been admitted by you as by others to be [[vice]] and deformity, an answer
might have been given to you on received principles [[principle]]; but now i perceive
that you will call [[injustice]] honourable and [[strong]], and to the unjust
you will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before
to the just, seeing that you do not hesitate to rank [[injustice]] with
wisdom and [[virtue]]. 

you have guessed most infallibly, he replied. 
then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument
so long as i have [[reason]] to [[think]] that you, thrasymachus, are speaking
your real [[mind]]; for i do [[believe]] that you are now in earnest and are
not amusing yourself at our expense. 

i may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you? --to refute the
argument is your [[business]]. 

very true, i said; that is what i have to do: but will you be so good
as [[answer]] yet one more [[question]]? does the just [[man]] try to gain any
advantage over the just? 

far otherwise; if he did would not be the simple, amusing creature
which he is. 

and would he try to go beyond just action? 
he would not. 
and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the
unjust; would that be considered by him as just or [[unjust]]?

he would [[think]] it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he
would not be able. 

whether he would or would not be able, i said, is not to the point.
my [[question]] is only whether the just [[man]], while refusing to have more
than another just [[man]], would [[wish]] and claim to have more than the
unjust? 

yes, he would. 
and what of the [[unjust]] --does he claim to have more than the just
man and to do more than is just 

of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all [[men]].

and the [[unjust]] [[man]] will strive and struggle to obtain more than the
unjust [[man]] or action, in order that he may have more than all?

true. 
we may put the matter thus, i said --the just does not [[desire]] more
than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the [[unjust]] desires
more than both his like and his unlike? 

nothing, he said, can be [[better]] than that statement. 
and the [[unjust]] is [[good]] and [[wise]], and the just is neither?

good again, he said. 
and is not the [[unjust]] like the [[wise]] and [[good]] and the just unlike them?

of course, he said, he who is of a [[certain]] [[nature]], is like those who
are of a [[certain]] [[nature]]; he who is not, not. 

each of them, i said, is such as his like is? 
certainly, he replied. 
very [[good]], thrasymachus, i said; and now to take the case of the [[arts]]:
you would admit that one [[man]] is a musician and another not a musician?

yes. 
and which is [[wise]] and which is foolish? 
clearly the musician is [[wise]], and he who is not a musician is foolish.

and he is [[good]] in as far as he is [[wise]], and [[bad]] in as far as he is
foolish? 

yes. 
and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?

yes. 
and do you [[think]], my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts
the lyre would [[desire]] or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in
the tightening and loosening the strings? 

i do not [[think]] that he would. 
but he would claim to exceed the non-musician? 
of course. 
and what would you say of the physician? in prescribing meats and
drinks would he [[wish]] to go beyond another physician or beyond the
practice of medicine? 

he would not. 
but he would [[wish]] to go beyond the non-physician? 
yes. 
and about [[knowledge]] and ignorance in general; see whether you think
that any [[man]] who has [[knowledge]] ever would [[wish]] to have the choice
of saying or doing more than another [[man]] who has [[knowledge]]. would
he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?

that, i suppose, can hardly be denied. 
and what of the ignorant? would he not [[desire]] to have more than either
the knowing or the ignorant? 

i dare say. 
and the knowing is [[wise]]? 
yes. 
and the [[wise]] is [[good]]? 
true. 
then the [[wise]] and [[good]] will not [[desire]] to gain more than his like,
but more than his unlike and opposite? 

i suppose so. 
whereas the [[bad]] and ignorant will [[desire]] to gain more than both?

yes. 
but did we not say, thrasymachus, that the [[unjust]] goes beyond both
his like and unlike? were not these your words? they were.

they were. 
and you also said that the [[lust]] will not go beyond his like but his
unlike? 

yes. 
then the just is like the [[wise]] and [[good]], and the [[unjust]] like the evil
and ignorant? 

that is the inference. 
and each of them is such as his like is? 
that was admitted. 
then the just has turned out to be [[wise]] and [[good]] and the [[unjust]] evil
and ignorant. 

thrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as i repeat
them, but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer's day, and
the perspiration poured from him in torrents; and then i saw what
i had never seen before, thrasymachus blushing. as we were now agreed
that [[justice]] was [[virtue]] and [[wisdom]], and [[injustice]] [[vice]] and ignorance,
i proceeded to another point: 

well, i said, thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were we
not also saying that [[injustice]] had [[strength]]; do you [[remember]]?

yes, i [[remember]], he said, but do not suppose that i approve of what
you are saying or have no [[answer]]; if however i were to [[answer]], you
would be quite [[certain]] to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either
permit me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and
i will [[answer]] 'very [[good]],' as they say to story-telling old [[women]],
and will nod 'yes' and 'no.' 

certainly not, i said, if contrary to your real [[opinion]].

yes, he said, i will, to please you, since you will not let me speak.
what else would you have? 

nothing in the [[world]], i said; and if you are so disposed i will ask
and you shall [[answer]]. 

proceed. 
then i will repeat the [[question]] which i [[asked]] before, in order that
our examination of the relative [[nature]] of [[justice]] and [[injustice]] may
be carried on regularly. a statement was made that [[injustice]] is stronger
and more powerful than [[justice]], but now [[justice]], having been identified
with [[wisdom]] and [[virtue]], is easily shown to be stronger than [[injustice]],
if [[injustice]] is ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any
one. but i want to view the matter, thrasymachus, in a different way:
you would not deny that a [[state]] may be [[unjust]] and may be unjustly
attempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them,
and may be holding many of them in subjection? 

true, he replied; and i will add the [[best]] and perfectly [[unjust]] state
will be most likely to do so. 

i [[know]], i said, that such was your position; but what i would further
consider is, whether this [[power]] which is possessed by the superior
state can [[exist]] or be exercised without [[justice]]. 

if you are [[right]] in you view, and [[justice]] is [[wisdom]], then only with
justice; but if i am [[right]], then without [[justice]]. 

i am delighted, thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent and
dissent, but making answers [[answer]] which are quite excellent. 

that is out of civility to you, he replied. 
you are very [[kind]], i said; and would you have the goodness also to
inform me, whether you [[think]] that a [[state]], or an [[army]], or a band of
robbers and thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at
all if they injured one another? 

no indeed, he said, they could not. 
but if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act
together [[better]]? 

yes. 
and this is because [[injustice]] creates divisions and hatreds and fighting,
and [[justice]] imparts harmony and [[friendship]]; is not that true, thrasymachus?

i agree, he said, because i do not [[wish]] to quarrel with you.

how [[good]] of you, i said; but i should like to [[know]] also whether [[injustice]],
having this tendency to arouse [[hatred]], wherever existing, among slaves
or among freemen, will not make them hate one another and set them
at variance and render them incapable of [[common]] action? 

certainly. 
and even if [[injustice]] be found in two only, will they not quarrel
and [[fight]], and become enemies [[enemy]] to one another and to the just

they will. 
and suppose [[injustice]] abiding in a [[single]] [[person]], would your wisdom
say that she loses or that she retains her [[natural]] [[power]]?

let us assume that she retains her [[power]]. 
yet is not the [[power]] which [[injustice]] exercises of such a [[nature]] that
wherever she takes up her abode, whether in a [[city]], in an [[army]], in
a [[family]], or in any other [[body]], that [[body]] is, to begin with, rendered
incapable of [[united]] action by [[reason]] of sedition and distraction;
and does it not become its own [[enemy]] and at variance with all that
opposes it, and with the just? is not this the case? 

yes, certainly. 
and is not [[injustice]] equally fatal when existing in a [[single]] [[person]];
in the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is
not at unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy
to himself and the just? is not that true, thrasymachus?

yes. 
and o my friend, i said, surely the gods are just? 
granted that they are. 
but if so, the [[unjust]] will be the [[enemy]] of the gods, and the just
will be their friend? 

feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; i will
not oppose you, lest i should displease the company. 

well then, proceed with your answers [[answer]], and let me have the remainder
of my repast. for we have already shown that the just are clearly
wiser and [[better]] and abler than the [[unjust]], and that the [[unjust]] are
incapable of [[common]] action; nay ing at more, that to speak as we did
of [[men]] who are [[evil]] acting at any [[time]] vigorously together, is not
strictly true, for if they had been perfectly [[evil]], they would have
laid hands upon one another; but it is evident that there must have
been some remnant of [[justice]] in them, which enabled them to combine;
if there had not been they would have injured one another as well
as their victims; they were but half --villains in their enterprises;
for had they been whole villains, and utterly [[unjust]], they would have
been utterly incapable of action. that, as i [[believe]], is the truth
of the matter, and not what you said at first. but whether the just
have a [[better]] and happier [[life]] than the [[unjust]] is a further question
which we also proposed to consider. i [[think]] that they have, and for
the reasons [[reason]] which to have given; but still i should like to examine
further, for no [[light]] matter is at stake, nothing less than the rule
of [[human]] [[life]]. 

proceed. 
i will proceed by asking a [[question]]: would you not say that a horse
has some end? 

i should. 
and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could
not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?

i do not [[understand]], he said. 
let me explain: can you see, except with the eye? 
certainly not. 
or hear, except with the ear? 
no. 
these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?

they may. 
but you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel,
and in many other ways? 

of course. 
and yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the [[purpose]]?

true. 
may we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook? 
we may. 
then now i [[think]] you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning
when i [[asked]] the [[question]] whether the end of anything would be that
which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any
other thing? 

i [[understand]] your meaning, he said, and assent. 
and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? need
i ask again whether the eye has an end? 

it has. 
and has not the eye an excellence? 
yes. 
and the ear has an end and an excellence also? 
true. 
and the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an
end and a special excellence? 

that is so. 
well, and can the [[eyes]] fulfil their end if they are wanting in their
own proper excellence and have a defect instead? 

how can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?

you mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which
is sight; but i have not arrived at that point yet. i would rather
ask the [[question]] more generally, and only enquire whether the things
which fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence,
and fall of fulfilling them by their own defect? 

certainly, he replied. 
i might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper
excellence they cannot fulfil their end? 

true. 
and the same observation will apply to all other things?

i agree. 
well; and has not the [[soul]] an end which nothing else can fulfil? for
example, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. are
not these functions proper to the [[soul]], and can they rightly be assigned
to any other? 

to no other. 
and is not [[life]] to be reckoned among the ends of the [[soul]]?

assuredly, he said. 
and has not the [[soul]] an excellence also? 
yes. 
and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that
excellence? 

she cannot. 
then an [[evil]] [[soul]] must necessarily be an [[evil]] ruler and superintendent,
and the [[good]] [[soul]] a [[good]] ruler? 

yes, necessarily. 
and we have admitted that [[justice]] is the excellence of the [[soul]], and
injustice the defect of the [[soul]]? 

that has been admitted. 
then the just [[soul]] and the just [[man]] will [[live]] well, and the unjust
man will [[live]] ill? 

that is what your argument proves. 
and he who lives [[life]] well is blessed and [[happy]], and he who lives [[life]] ill the
reverse of [[happy]]? 

certainly. 
then the just is [[happy]], and the [[unjust]] miserable? 
so be it. 
but [[happiness]] and not misery is profitable. 
of course. 
then, my blessed thrasymachus, [[injustice]] can never be more profitable
than [[justice]]. 

let this, [[socrates]], he said, be your entertainment at the bendidea.

for which i am indebted to you, i said, now that you have grown gentle
towards me and have left off scolding. nevertheless, i have not been
well entertained; but that was my own [[fault]] and not yours. as an epicure
snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table,
he not having allowed himself [[time]] to enjoy the one before, so have
i gone from one [[subject]] to another without having discovered what
i sought at first, the [[nature]] of [[justice]]. i left that enquiry and
turned away to consider whether [[justice]] is [[virtue]] and [[wisdom]] or evil
and folly; and when there arose a further [[question]] about the comparative
advantages of [[justice]] and [[injustice]], i could not refrain from passing
on to that. and the result of the whole discussion has been that i
know nothing at all. for i [[know]] not what [[justice]] is, and therefore
i am not likely to [[know]] whether it is or is not a [[virtue]], nor can
i say whether the just [[man]] is [[happy]] or unhappy. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book ii

socrates - glaucon 

with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion;
but the end, in [[truth]], proved to be only a beginning. for glaucon,
who is always the most pugnacious of [[men]], was dissatisfied at thrasymachus'
retirement; he wanted to have the [[battle]] out. so he said to me: [[socrates]],
do you [[wish]] really to persuade us, or only to seem to have persuaded
us, that to be just is always [[better]] than to be [[unjust]]? 

i should [[wish]] really to persuade you, i replied, if i could.

then you certainly have not succeeded. let me ask you now: --how would
you arrange goods [[good]] --are there not some which we welcome for their
own sakes, and independently of their consequences, as, for [[example]],
harmless pleasures [[pleasure]] and enjoyments, which delight us at the [[time]], although
nothing follows from them? 

i agree in thinking that there is such a class, i replied.

is there not also a second class of goods [[good]], such as [[knowledge]], sight,
health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their
results? 

certainly, i said. 
and would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and
the [[care]] of the sick, and the physician's art [[arts]]; also the various ways
of money-making --these do us [[good]] but we regard them as disagreeable;
and no one would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the
sake of some [[reward]] or result which flows from them? 

there is, i said, this third class also. but why do you ask?

because i want to [[know]] in which of the three classes you would place
justice? 

in the highest class, i replied, --among those goods [[good]] which he who
would be [[happy]] desires [[desire]] both for their own sake and for the sake of
their results. 

then the many are of another [[mind]]; they [[think]] that [[justice]] is to be
reckoned in the troublesome class, among goods [[good]] which are to be pursued
for the sake of rewards [[reward]] and of [[reputation]], but in themselves are disagreeable
and rather to be avoided. 

i [[know]], i said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that this
was the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he
censured [[justice]] and praised [[injustice]]. but i am too stupid to be
convinced by him. 

i [[wish]], he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then i
shall see whether you and i agree. for thrasymachus seems to me, like
a snake, to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to
have been; but to my [[mind]] the [[nature]] of [[justice]] and [[injustice]] have
not yet been made clear. setting aside their rewards [[reward]] and results,
i want to [[know]] what they are in themselves, and how they inwardly
work in the [[soul]]. if you, please, then, i will revive the argument
of thrasymachus. and first i will speak of the [[nature]] and origin of
justice according to the [[common]] view of them. secondly, i will show
that all [[men]] who practise [[justice]] do so against their will, of necessity,
but not as a [[good]]. and thirdly, i will argue that there is reason
in this view, for the [[life]] of the [[unjust]] is after all [[better]] far than
the [[life]] of the just --if what they say is true, [[socrates]], since i
myself am not of their [[opinion]]. but still i acknowledge that i am
perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and myriads of others
dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, i have never yet heard
the superiority of [[justice]] to [[injustice]] maintained by any one in a
satisfactory way. i want to hear [[justice]] praised in [[respect]] of itself;
then i shall be satisfied, and you are the [[person]] from whom i think
that i am most likely to hear this; and therefore i will [[praise]] the
unjust [[life]] to the utmost of my [[power]], and my manner of speaking will
indicate the manner in which i [[desire]] to hear you too praising justice
and censuring [[injustice]]. will you say whether you approve of my proposal?

indeed i do; nor can i imagine any theme about which a [[man]] of sense
would oftener [[wish]] to converse. 

i am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin by
speaking, as i proposed, of the [[nature]] and origin of [[justice]].

glaucon 

they say that to do [[injustice]] is, by [[nature]], [[good]]; to suffer [[injustice]],
evil; but that the [[evil]] is greater than the [[good]]. and so when men
have both done and [[suffered]] [[injustice]] and have had [[experience]] of both,
not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they [[think]] that
they had [[better]] agree among themselves to have neither; hence there
arise laws [[law]] and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law
is termed by them lawful and just. this they affirm to be the origin
and [[nature]] of [[justice]]; --it is a mean or compromise, between the best
of all, which is to do [[injustice]] and not be punished, and the worst
of all, which is to suffer [[injustice]] without the [[power]] of retaliation;
and [[justice]], being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated
not as a [[good]], but as the lesser [[evil]], and honoured by [[reason]] of the
inability of [[men]] to do [[injustice]]. for no [[man]] who is worthy to be called
a [[man]] would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist;
he would be mad if he did. such is the received account, [[socrates]],
of the [[nature]] and origin of [[justice]]. 

now that those who practise [[justice]] do so involuntarily and because
they have not the [[power]] to be [[unjust]] will [[best]] appear if we imagine
something of this [[kind]]: having given both to the just and the unjust
power to do what they will, let us watch and see whither [[desire]] will
lead them; then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust
man to be proceeding along the same road, following their interest,
which all natures [[nature]] deem to be their [[good]], and are only diverted into
the path of [[justice]] by the [[force]] of [[law]]. the [[liberty]] which we are
supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such
a [[power]] as is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of
croesus the lydian. according to the tradition, gyges was a shepherd
in the service of the [[king]] of lydia; there was a [[great]] storm, and
an earthquake made an opening in the [[earth]] at the place where he was
feeding his flock. amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening,
where, among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having
doors, at which he stooping and looking in saw a [[dead]] [[body]] of stature,
as appeared to him, more than [[human]], and having nothing on but a gold
ring; this he took from the finger of the [[dead]] and reascended. now
the shepherds met together, according to custom, that they might send
their monthly report about the flocks to the [[king]]; into their assembly
he came having the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among
them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when
instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they
began to speak of him as if he were no longer [[present]]. he was astonished
at this, and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards
and reappeared; he made several trials of the ring, and always with
the same result-when he turned the collet inwards he became invisible,
when outwards he reappeared. whereupon he contrived to be chosen one
of the messengers who were sent to the court; where as soon as he
arrived he seduced the queen, and with her [[help]] conspired against
the [[king]] and slew him, and took the [[kingdom]]. suppose now that there
were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the
unjust the other;,no [[man]] can be imagined to be of such an iron nature
that he would stand fast in [[justice]]. no [[man]] would keep his hands off
what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of
the market, or go into houses and [[lie]] with any one at his [[pleasure]],
or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects
be like a [[god]] among [[men]]. then the actions of the just would be as
the actions of the [[unjust]]; they would both come at [[last]] to the same
point. and this we may truly affirm to be a [[great]] proof that a man
is just, not willingly or because he thinks [[think]] that [[justice]] is any good
to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks
that he can safely be [[unjust]], there he is [[unjust]]. for all [[men]] believe
in their hearts [[heart]] that [[injustice]] is far more profitable to the individual
than [[justice]], and he who argues as i have been supposing, will say
that they are [[right]]. if you could imagine any one obtaining this power
of becoming invisible, and never doing any [[wrong]] or touching what
was another's, he would be [[thought]] by the lookers-on to be a most
wretched idiot, although they would [[praise]] him to one another's faces,
and keep up appearances with one another from a [[fear]] that they too
might suffer [[injustice]]. enough of this. 

now, if we are to form a real [[judgment]] of the [[life]] of the just and
unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the
isolation to be effected? i [[answer]]: let the [[unjust]] [[man]] be entirely
unjust, and the just [[man]] entirely just; nothing is to be taken away
from either of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the
work of their respective lives [[life]]. first, let the [[unjust]] be like other
distinguished masters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician,
who knows [[know]] intuitively his own powers [[power]] and keeps within their limits,
and who, if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself. so
let the [[unjust]] make his [[unjust]] attempts in the [[right]] way, and lie
hidden if he means to be [[great]] in his [[injustice]] (he who is found out
is nobody): for the highest reach of [[injustice]] is: to be deemed just
when you are not. therefore i say that in the perfectly [[unjust]] man
we must assume the most [[perfect]] [[injustice]]; there is to be no deduction,
but we must allow him, while doing the most [[unjust]] acts, to have acquired
the [[greatest]] [[reputation]] for [[justice]]. if he have taken a false step
he must be able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with
effect, if any of his deeds come to [[light]], and who can [[force]] his way
where [[force]] is required his [[courage]] and [[strength]], and command of money
and [[friends]]. and at his side let us place the just [[man]] in his nobleness
and simplicity, wishing, as aeschylus says, to be and not to seem
good. there must be no seeming, for if he seem to be just he will
be honoured and rewarded, and then we shall not [[know]] whether he is
just for the sake of [[justice]] or for the sake of honours [[honour]] and rewards [[reward]];
therefore, let him be clothed in [[justice]] only, and have no other covering;
and he must be imagined in a [[state]] of [[life]] the opposite of the former.
let him be the [[best]] of [[men]], and let him be [[thought]] the worst; then
he will have been put to the proof; and we shall see whether he will
be affected by the [[fear]] of infamy and its consequences. and let him
continue thus to the hour of [[death]]; being just and seeming to be [[unjust]].
when both have reached the uttermost extreme, the one of [[justice]] and
the other of [[injustice]], let [[judgment]] be given which of them is the
happier of the two. 

socrates - glaucon 

heavens! my dear glaucon, i said, how energetically you polish them
up for the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were
two statues. 

i do my [[best]], he said. and now that we [[know]] what they are like there
is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of [[life]] which awaits either
of them. this i will proceed to describe; but as you may [[think]] the
description a little too coarse, i ask you to suppose, [[socrates]], that
the words which [[follow]] are not mine. --let me put them into the mouths
of the eulogists of [[injustice]]: they will tell you that the just man
who is [[thought]] [[unjust]] will be scourged, racked, bound --will have
his [[eyes]] burnt out; and, at [[last]], after suffering every [[kind]] of [[evil]],
he will be impaled: then he will [[understand]] that he ought to seem
only, and not to be, just; the words of aeschylus may be more truly
spoken of the [[unjust]] than of the just. for the [[unjust]] is pursuing
a reality; he does not [[live]] with a view to appearances --he wants
to be really [[unjust]] and not to seem only:-- 

his [[mind]] has a soil deep and fertile, 
out of which spring his prudent counsels. in the first place, he is
thought just, and therefore bears [[rule]] in the [[city]]; he can [[marry]] whom
he will, and give in [[marriage]] to whom he will; also he can [[trade]] and
deal where he likes, and always to his own advantage, because he has
no misgivings about [[injustice]] and at every contest, whether in public
or private, he gets the [[better]] of his antagonists, and gains at their
expense, and is [[rich]], and out of his gains he can benefit his [[friends]],
and harm his enemies [[enemy]]; moreover, he can offer sacrifices [[sacrifice]], and dedicate
gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently, and can [[honour]] the
gods or any [[man]] whom he wants to [[honour]] in a far [[better]] style than
the just, and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to
the gods. and thus, [[socrates]], gods and [[men]] are said to unite in making
the [[life]] of the [[unjust]] [[better]] than the [[life]] of the just.

adeimantus -socrates 

i was going to say something in [[answer]] to glaucon, when adeimantus,
his [[brother]], interposed: [[socrates]], he said, you do not suppose that
there is nothing more to be urged? 

why, what else is there? i answered. 
the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied.

well, then, according to the proverb, 'let [[brother]] [[help]] brother' --if
he fails in any part do you assist him; although i must confess that
glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take
from me the [[power]] of helping [[justice]]. 

adeimantus 

nonsense, he replied. but let me add something more: there is another
side to glaucon's argument about the [[praise]] and censure of justice
and [[injustice]], which is equally required in order to bring out what
i [[believe]] to be his meaning. parents and tutors are always telling
their sons [[son]] and their wards that they are to be just; but why? not
for the sake of [[justice]], but for the sake of [[character]] and [[reputation]];
in the [[hope]] of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those
offices, marriages [[marriage]], and the like which glaucon has enumerated among
the advantages accruing to the [[unjust]] from the [[reputation]] of [[justice]].
more, however, is made of appearances by this class of persons [[person]] than
by the others; for they throw in the [[good]] [[opinion]] of the gods, and
will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens [[heaven]], as they say,
rain upon the pious; and this accords with the testimony of the noble
hesiod and [[homer]], the first of whom says, that the gods make the oaks
of the just-- 

to hear acorns at their summit, and bees i the middle; 
and the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces. and
many other blessings of a like [[kind]] are provided for them. and homer
has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is--

as the fame of some blameless [[king]] who, like a [[god]], 
maintains [[justice]] to whom the black [[earth]] brings forth 
wheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit, 
and his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish. still
grander are the gifts of [[heaven]] which musaeus and his [[son]] vouchsafe
to the just; they take them down into the [[world]] below, where they
have the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk,
crowned with garlands; their [[idea]] seems to be that an immortality
of drunkenness is the highest meed of [[virtue]]. some extend their rewards
yet further; the [[posterity]], as they say, of the faithful and just
shall survive to the third and fourth [[generation]]. this is the style
in which they [[praise]] [[justice]]. but about the wicked there is another
strain; they bury them in a slough in [[hades]], and make them carry water
in a sieve; also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy,
and inflict upon them the punishments [[punishment]] which glaucon described as the
portion of the just who are reputed to be [[unjust]]; nothing else does
their invention supply. such is their manner of praising the one and
censuring the other. 

once more, [[socrates]], i will ask you to consider another way of speaking
about [[justice]] and [[injustice]], which is not confined to the poets, but
is found in prose writers. the universal voice of [[mankind]] is always
declaring that [[justice]] and [[virtue]] are honourable, but grievous and
toilsome; and that the pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[vice]] and [[injustice]] are easy of
attainment, and are only censured by [[law]] and [[opinion]]. they say also
that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty;
and they are quite ready to call wicked [[men]] [[happy]], and to [[honour]] them
both in [[public]] and private when they are [[rich]] or in any other way
influential, while they despise and overlook those who may be weak
and [[poor]], even though acknowledging them to be [[better]] than the others.
but most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue
and the gods: they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery
to many [[good]] [[men]], and [[good]] and [[happiness]] to the wicked. and mendicant
prophets go to [[rich]] men's doors and persuade them that they have a
power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man's
own or his ancestor's sins [[sin]] by sacrifices [[sacrifice]] or charms, with rejoicings
and feasts; and they promise to harm an [[enemy]], whether just or [[unjust]],
at a small cost; with magic [[arts]] and incantations binding [[heaven]],
as they say, to execute their will. and the poets are the authorities
to whom they appeal, now smoothing the path of [[vice]] with the words
of hesiod; -- 

vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth and
her dwelling-place is near. but before [[virtue]] the gods have set toil,
and a tedious and uphill road: then citing [[homer]] as a witness that
the gods may be influenced by [[men]]; for he also says: 

the gods, too, may he turned from their [[purpose]]; and [[men]] [[pray]] to them
and avert their wrath by sacrifices [[sacrifice]] and soothing entreaties, and by
libations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed.
and they [[produce]] a host of books [[book]] written by musaeus and orpheus, who
were [[children]] of the moon and the muses --that is what they say --according
to which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals [[individual]],
but whole cities [[city]], that expiations and atonements for [[sin]] may be made
by sacrifices [[sacrifice]] and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally
at the service of the living and the [[dead]]; the latter sort they call
mysteries, and they redeem us from the pains [[pain]] of hell, but if we neglect
them no one knows [[know]] what awaits us. 

he proceeded: and now when the [[young]] hear all this said about virtue
and [[vice]], and the way in which gods and [[men]] regard them, how are their
minds likely to be affected, my dear [[socrates]], --those of them, i
mean, who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, [[light]] on every
flower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions
as to what manner of persons [[person]] they should be and in what way they should
walk if they would make the [[best]] of [[life]]? probably the [[youth]] will
say to himself in the words of pindar-- 

can i by [[justice]] or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower
which may he a fortress to me all my days? for what [[men]] say is that,
if i am really just and am not also [[thought]] just [[profit]] there is none,
but the [[pain]] and loss on the other hand are unmistakable. but if,
though [[unjust]], i acquire the [[reputation]] of [[justice]], a heavenly life
is promised to me. since then, as [[philosophers]] prove, appearance tyrannizes
over [[truth]] and is [[lord]] of [[happiness]], to appearance i must devote myself.
i will describe around me a picture and shadow of [[virtue]] to be the
vestibule and exterior of my house; behind i will trail the subtle
and crafty fox, as archilochus, [[greatest]] of sages, recommends. but
i hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often
difficult; to which i [[answer]], nothing [[great]] is easy. nevertheless,
the argument indicates this, if we would be [[happy]], to be the path
along which we should proceed. with a view to concealment we will
establish secret brotherhoods and [[political]] clubs. and there are professors
of rhetoric who [[teach]] the art [[arts]] of persuading courts and assemblies;
and so, partly by persuasion and partly by [[force]], i shall make unlawful
gains and not be punished. still i hear a voice saying that the gods
cannot be deceived, neither can they be compelled. but what if there
are no gods? or, suppose them to have no [[care]] of [[human]] things --why
in either case should we [[mind]] about concealment? and even if there
are gods, and they do [[care]] about us, yet we [[know]] of them only from
tradition and the genealogies of the poets; and these are the very
persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by 'sacrifices
and soothing entreaties and by offerings.' let us be consistent then,
and [[believe]] both or neither. if the poets speak truly, why then we
had [[better]] be [[unjust]], and offer of the fruits of [[injustice]]; for if
we are just, although we may escape the vengeance of [[heaven]], we shall
lose the gains of [[injustice]]; but, if we are [[unjust]], we shall keep
the gains, and by our sinning and praying, and praying and sinning,
the gods will be propitiated, and we shall not be punished. 'but there
is a [[world]] below in which either we or our [[posterity]] will suffer for
our [[unjust]] deeds.' yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there
are mysteries and atoning deities, and these have [[great]] [[power]]. that
is what mighty cities [[city]] declare; and the [[children]] of the gods, who were
their poets and prophets [[prophet]], bear a like testimony. 

on what [[principle]], then, shall we any longer choose [[justice]] rather
than the worst [[injustice]]? when, if we only unite the latter with a
deceitful regard to appearances, we shall fare to our [[mind]] both with
gods and [[men]], in [[life]] and after [[death]], as the most numerous and the
highest authorities [[authority]] tell us. knowing all this, [[socrates]], how can a
man who has any superiority of [[mind]] or [[person]] or rank or [[wealth]], be
willing to [[honour]] [[justice]]; or indeed to refrain from laughing when
he hears [[justice]] praised? and even if there should be some one who
is able to disprove the [[truth]] of my words, and who is satisfied that
justice is [[best]], still he is not angry with the [[unjust]], but is very
ready to [[forgive]] them, because he also knows [[know]] that [[men]] are not just
of their own [[free]] will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom
the divinity within him may have inspired with a [[hatred]] of [[injustice]],
or who has attained [[knowledge]] of the [[truth]] --but no other [[man]]. he
only blames [[injustice]] who, owing to cowardice or [[age]] or some weakness,
has not the [[power]] of being [[unjust]]. and this is proved by the fact
that when he obtains the [[power]], he immediately becomes [[unjust]] as far
as he can be. 

the cause of all this, [[socrates]], was indicated by us at the beginning
of the argument, when my [[brother]] and i told you how astonished we
were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of [[justice]] --beginning
with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to
us, and ending with the [[men]] of our own [[time]] --no one has ever blamed
injustice or praised [[justice]] except with a view to the glories, honours [[honour]],
and benefits which flow from them. no one has ever adequately described
either in verse or prose the true essential [[nature]] of either of them
abiding in the [[soul]], and invisible to any [[human]] or [[divine]] eye; or
shown that of all the things of a man's [[man]] [[soul]] which he has within him,
justice is the [[greatest]] [[good]], and [[injustice]] the [[greatest]] [[evil]]. had
this been the universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of this
from our [[youth]] upwards, we should not have been on the watch to keep
one another from doing [[wrong]], but every one would have been his own
watchman, because afraid, if he did [[wrong]], of harbouring in himself
the [[greatest]] of evils [[evil]]. i dare say that thrasymachus and others would
seriously hold the [[language]] which i have been merely repeating, and
words even stronger than these about [[justice]] and [[injustice]], grossly,
as i conceive, perverting their true [[nature]]. but i speak in this vehement
manner, as i must frankly confess to you, because i want to hear from
you the opposite side; and i would ask you to show not only the superiority
which [[justice]] has over [[injustice]], but what effect they have on the
possessor of them which makes the one to be a [[good]] and the other an
evil to him. and please, as glaucon requested of you, to exclude reputations;
for unless you take away from each of them his true [[reputation]] and
add on the false, we shall say that you do not [[praise]] [[justice]], but
the appearance of it; we shall [[think]] that you are only exhorting us
to keep [[injustice]] dark, and that you really agree with thrasymachus
in thinking that [[justice]] is another's [[good]] and the interest of the
stronger, and that [[injustice]] is a man's [[man]] own [[profit]] and interest, though
injurious to the weaker. now as you have admitted that [[justice]] is
one of that highest class of goods [[good]] which are [[desired]] indeed for their
results, but in a far greater [[degree]] for their own sakes --like sight
or hearing or [[knowledge]] or health, or any other real and [[natural]] and
not merely conventional [[good]] --i would ask you in your [[praise]] of justice
to regard one point only: i mean the essential [[good]] and [[evil]] which
justice and [[injustice]] [[work]] in the possessors of them. let others praise
justice and censure [[injustice]], magnifying the rewards [[reward]] and honours
of the one and abusing the other; that is a manner of arguing which,
coming from them, i am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent
your whole [[life]] in the consideration of this [[question]], unless i hear
the contrary from your own lips, i expect something [[better]]. and therefore,
i say, not only prove to us that [[justice]] is [[better]] than [[injustice]],
but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them, which
makes the one to be a [[good]] and the other an [[evil]], whether seen or
unseen by gods and [[men]]. 

socrates - adeimantus 

i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus, but on
hearing these words i was quite delighted, and said: sons [[son]] of an illustrious
father, that was not a [[bad]] beginning of the elegiac verses which the
admirer of glaucon made in [[honour]] of you after you had distinguished
yourselves at the [[battle]] of megara:-- 

'sons of ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious hero.'
the epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine
in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of [[injustice]],
and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. and i do believe
that you are not convinced --this i infer from your general [[character]],
for had i judged only from your speeches [[speech]] i should have mistrusted
you. but now, the greater my confidence in you, the greater is my
difficulty in knowing what to say. for i am in a strait between two;
on the one hand i [[feel]] that i am unequal to the task; and my inability
is brought [[home]] to me by the [[fact]] that you were not satisfied with
the [[answer]] which i made to thrasymachus, proving, as i [[thought]], the
superiority which [[justice]] has over [[injustice]]. and yet i cannot refuse
to [[help]], while breath and [[speech]] remain to me; i am afraid that there
would be an impiety in being [[present]] when [[justice]] is [[evil]] spoken of
and not lifting up a hand in her defence. and therefore i had best
give such [[help]] as i can. 

glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question
drop, but to proceed in the investigation. they wanted to arrive at
the [[truth]], first, about the [[nature]] of [[justice]] and [[injustice]], and secondly,
about their relative advantages. i told them, what i --really [[thought]],
that the enquiry would be of a serious [[nature]], and would require very
good [[eyes]]. seeing then, i said, that we are no [[great]] wits, i think
that we had [[better]] adopt a method which i may illustrate thus; suppose
that a short-sighted [[person]] had been [[asked]] by some one to [[read]] small
letters from a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they
might be found in another place which was larger and in which the
letters were larger --if they were the same and he could [[read]] the
larger letters first, and then proceed to the lesser --this would
have been [[thought]] a rare piece of [[good]] [[fortune]]. 

very true, said adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to
our enquiry? 

i will tell you, i replied; [[justice]], which is the [[subject]] of our enquiry,
is, as you [[know]], sometimes spoken of as the [[virtue]] of an [[individual]],
and sometimes as the [[virtue]] of a [[state]]. 

true, he replied. 
and is not a [[state]] larger than an [[individual]]? 
it is. 
then in the larger the quantity of [[justice]] is likely to be larger
and more easily discernible. i propose therefore that we enquire into
the [[nature]] of [[justice]] and [[injustice]], first as they appear in the [[state]],
and secondly in the [[individual]], proceeding from the greater to the
lesser and comparing them. 

that, he said, is an excellent proposal. 
and if we imagine the [[state]] in process of creation, we shall see the
justice and [[injustice]] of the [[state]] in process of creation also.

i dare say. 
when the [[state]] is completed there may be a [[hope]] that the object of
our search will be more easily discovered. 

yes, far more easily. 
but ought we to attempt to construct one? i said; for to do so, as
i am inclined to [[think]], will be a very serious task. reflect therefore.

i have reflected, said adeimantus, and am anxious that you should
proceed. 

a [[state]], i said, arises, as i conceive, out of the needs of [[mankind]];
no one is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. can any other
origin of a [[state]] be imagined? 

there can i be no other. 
then, as we have many wants, and many persons [[person]] are needed to supply
them, one takes a helper for one [[purpose]] and another for another;
and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation
the [[body]] of inhabitants is termed a [[state]]. 

true, he said. 
and they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives,
under the [[idea]] that the exchange will be for their [[good]].

very true. 
then, i said, let us begin and create in [[idea]] a [[state]]; and yet the
true creator is necessity, who is the [[mother]] of our invention.

of course, he replied. 
now the first and [[greatest]] of necessities is food, which is the condition
of [[life]] and existence. 

certainly. 
the second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like.

true. 
and now let us see how our [[city]] will be able to supply this great
demand: we may suppose that one [[man]] is a husbandman, another a builder,
some one else a weaver --shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps
some other purveyor to our bodily wants? 

quite [[right]]. 
the barest notion of a [[state]] must include four or five [[men]].

clearly. 
and how will they proceed? will each bring the result of his labours
into a [[common]] stock? --the [[individual]] husbandman, for [[example]], producing
for four, and labouring four times [[time]] as long and as much as he need
in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as
himself; or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the
trouble of producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth
of the food in a fourth of the [[time]], and in the remaining three-fourths
of his [[time]] be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes,
having no partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own
wants? 

adeimantus [[thought]] that he should aim at producing food only and not
at producing everything. 

probably, i replied, that would be the [[better]] way; and when i hear
you say this, i am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there
are diversities of natures [[nature]] among us which are adapted to different
occupations. 

very true. 
and will you have a [[work]] [[better]] done when the workman has many occupations,
or when he has only one? 

when he has only one. 
further, there can be no [[doubt]] that a [[work]] is spoilt when not done
at the [[right]] [[time]]? 

no [[doubt]]. 
for [[business]] is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business
is at leisure; but the doer must [[follow]] up what he is doing, and make
the [[business]] his first object. 

he must. 
and if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully
and easily and of a [[better]] quality when one [[man]] does one thing which
is [[natural]] to him and does it at the [[right]] [[time]], and leaves other
things. 

undoubtedly.. 
then more than four [[citizens]] will be required; for the husbandman
will not make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture,
if they are to be [[good]] for anything. neither will the builder make
his tools --and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and
shoemaker. 

true. 
then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers
in our little [[state]], which is already beginning to grow?

true. 
yet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in order
that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as
well as husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers
fleeces and hides, --still our [[state]] will not be very large.

that is true; yet neither will it be a very small [[state]] which contains
all these. 

then, again, there is the situation of the [[city]] --to find a place
where nothing need be imported is well-nigh impossible. 

impossible. 
then there must be another class of [[citizens]] who will bring the required
supply from another [[city]]? 

there must. 
but if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require
who would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.

that is [[certain]]. 
and therefore what they [[produce]] at [[home]] must be not only enough for
themselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate
those from whom their wants are supplied. 

very true. 
then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?

they will. 
not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?

yes. 
then we shall want merchants? 
we shall. 
and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors
will also be needed, and in considerable numbers? 

yes, in considerable numbers. 
then, again, within the [[city]], how will they exchange their productions?
to secure such an exchange was, as you will [[remember]], one of our principal
objects when we formed them into a [[society]] and constituted a [[state]].

clearly they will buy and sell. 
then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes
of exchange. 

certainly. 
suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production
to market, and he comes at a [[time]] when there is no one to exchange
with him, --is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?

not at all; he will find [[people]] there who, seeing the want, undertake
the office of salesmen. in well-ordered states they are commonly those
who are the weakest in bodily [[strength]], and therefore of little use
for any other [[purpose]]; their [[duty]] is to be in the market, and to give
money in exchange for goods [[good]] to those who [[desire]] to sell and to take
money from those who [[desire]] to buy. 

this want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our [[state]]. is
not 'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the market-place
engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from one city
to another are called merchants? 

yes, he said. 
and there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly
on the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily strength
for [[labour]], which accordingly they sell, and are called, if i do not
mistake, hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the price
of their [[labour]]. 

true. 
then hirelings will [[help]] to make up our [[population]]? 
yes. 
and now, adeimantus, is our [[state]] matured and perfected?

i [[think]] so. 
where, then, is [[justice]], and where is [[injustice]], and in what part
of the [[state]] did they spring up? 

probably in the dealings of these [[citizens]] with one another. cannot
imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else.

i dare say that you are [[right]] in your suggestion, i said; we had better
think the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry. 

let us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of [[life]],
now that we have thus established them. will they not [[produce]] corn,
and wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves?
and when they are housed, they will [[work]], in summer, commonly, stripped
and barefoot, but in winter substantially clothed and shod. they will
feed on barley-meal and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them,
making [[noble]] cakes and loaves; these they will serve up on a mat of
reeds or on clean leaves, themselves reclining the while upon beds
strewn with yew or myrtle. and they and their [[children]] will feast,
drinking of the wine which they have made, wearing garlands on their
heads, and hymning the praises [[praise]] of the gods, in [[happy]] converse with
one another. and they will take [[care]] that their families [[family]] do not exceed
their means; having an eye to [[poverty]] or [[war]]. 

socrates - glaucon 

but, said glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish to
their meal. 

true, i replied, i had forgotten; of course they must have a relish-salt,
and olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs such as
country [[people]] prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs, and
peas, and beans; and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns at
the [[fire]], drinking in moderation. and with such a diet they may be
expected to [[live]] in [[peace]] and health to a [[good]] old [[age]], and bequeath
a similar [[life]] to their [[children]] after them. 

yes, [[socrates]], he said, and if you were providing for a [[city]] of pigs,
how else would you feed the beasts? 

but what would you have, glaucon? i replied. 
why, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of [[life]].
people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to [[lie]] on sofas, and
dine off tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern
style. 

yes, i said, now i [[understand]]: the [[question]] which you would have me
consider is, not only how a [[state]], but how a luxurious [[state]] is created;
and possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a [[state]] we shall
be more likely to see how [[justice]] and [[injustice]] originate. in my opinion
the true and healthy [[constitution]] of the [[state]] is the one which i
have described. but if you [[wish]] also to see a [[state]] at fever heat,
i have no objection. for i suspect that many will not be satisfied
with the simpler way of way they will be for adding sofas, and tables,
and other furniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and
courtesans, and cakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every
variety; we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first
speaking, such as houses, and clothes, and shoes: the [[arts]] of the
painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion, and gold
and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured. 

true, he said. 
then we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy [[state]] is
no longer sufficient. now will the [[city]] have to fill and swell with
a multitude of callings which are not required by any [[natural]] want;
such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class
have to do with forms and colours; another will be the votaries of
music --poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists, players, dancers,
contractors; also makers of divers kinds [[kind]] of articles, including women's
dresses. and we shall want more servants. will not tutors be also
in request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well
as confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed
and therefore had no place in the former edition of our [[state]], but
are needed now? they must not be forgotten: and there will be animals
of many other kinds [[kind]], if [[people]] [[eat]] them. 

certainly. 
and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians
than before? 

much greater. 
and the [[country]] which was enough to support the original inhabitants
will be too small now, and not enough? 

quite true. 
then a slice of our neighbours' [[land]] will be wanted by us for pasture
and tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves,
they exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the
unlimited accumulation of [[wealth]]? 

that, [[socrates]], will be inevitable. 
and so we shall go to [[war]], glaucon. shall we not? 
most certainly, he replied. 
then without determining as yet whether [[war]] does [[good]] or harm, thus
much we may affirm, that now we have discovered [[war]] to be derived
from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils [[evil]] in states,
private as well as [[public]]. 

undoubtedly. 
and our [[state]] must once more enlarge; and this [[time]] the will be nothing
short of a whole [[army]], which will have to go out and [[fight]] with the
invaders for all that we have, as well as for the things and persons
whom we were describing above. 

why? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?

no, i said; not if we were [[right]] in the [[principle]] which was acknowledged
by all of us when we were framing the [[state]]: the [[principle]], as you
will [[remember]], was that one [[man]] cannot practise many [[arts]] with [[success]].

very true, he said. 
but is not [[war]] an art [[arts]]? 
certainly. 
and an art [[arts]] requiring as much attention as shoemaking? 
quite true. 
and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman, or a weaver,
a builder --in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to
him and to every other worker was assigned one [[work]] for which he was
by [[nature]] fitted, and at that he was to continue working all his life
long and at no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then
he would become a [[good]] workman. now nothing can be more important
than that the [[work]] of a soldier should be well done. but is [[war]] an
art so easily acquired that a [[man]] may be a warrior who is also a husbandman,
or shoemaker, or other artisan; although no one in the [[world]] would
be a [[good]] dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a
recreation, and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to
this and nothing else? 

no tools will make a [[man]] a skilled workman, or master of defence,
nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and
has never bestowed any attention upon them. how then will he who takes
up a shield or other implement of [[war]] become a [[good]] fighter all in
a day, whether with heavy-armed or any other [[kind]] of [[troops]]?

yes, he said, the tools which would [[teach]] [[men]] their own use would
be beyond price. 

and the higher the duties [[duty]] of the guardian, i said, the more [[time]],
and [[skill]], and art [[arts]], and application will be needed by him?

no [[doubt]], he replied. 
will he not also require [[natural]] aptitude for his calling?

certainly. 
then it will be our [[duty]] to select, if we can, natures [[nature]] which are fitted
for the task of guarding the [[city]]? 

it will. 
and the selection will be no easy matter, i said; but we must be brave
and do our [[best]]. 

we must. 
is not the [[noble]] [[youth]] very like a well-bred dog in [[respect]] of guarding
and watching? 

what do you mean? 
i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake
the [[enemy]] when they see him; and [[strong]] too if, when they have caught
him, they have to [[fight]] with him. 

all these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.

well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to [[fight]] well?

certainly. 
and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog
or any other animal? have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable
is spirit and how the presence of it makes the [[soul]] of any creature
to be absolutely fearless and indomitable? 

i have. 
then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are
required in the guardian. 

true. 
and also of the mental ones; his [[soul]] is to be full of spirit?

yes. 
but are not these spirited natures [[nature]] apt to be savage with one another,
and with everybody else? 

a difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied. 
whereas, i said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies [[enemy]], and
gentle to their [[friends]]; if not, they will [[destroy]] themselves without
waiting for their enemies [[enemy]] to [[destroy]] them. 

true, he said. 
what is to be done then? i said; how shall we find a gentle nature
which has also a [[great]] spirit, for the one is the contradiction of
the other? 

true. 
he will not be a [[good]] guardian who is wanting in either of these two
qualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible;
and hence we must infer that to be a [[good]] guardian is impossible.

i am afraid that what you say is true, he replied. 
here feeling perplexed i began to [[think]] over what had preceded. my
friend, i said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have
lost sight of the image which we had before us. 

what do you mean? he said. 
i mean to say that there do [[exist]] natures [[nature]] gifted with those opposite
qualities. 

and where do you find them? 
many animals, i replied, furnish examples [[example]] of them; our friend the
dog is a very [[good]] one: you [[know]] that well-bred dogs are perfectly
gentle to their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.

yes, i [[know]]. 
then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of [[nature]] in
our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?

certainly not. 
would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited
nature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher? 

i do not apprehend your meaning. 
the trait of which i am speaking, i replied, may be also seen in the
dog, and is remarkable in the animal. 

what trait? 
why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance,
he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor
the other any [[good]]. did this never strike you as [[curious]]?

the matter never struck me before; but i quite recognise the truth
of your remark. 

and surely this instinct of the dog is very charming; --your dog is
a true philosopher. 

why? 
why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy
only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing. and must not an
animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes
by the test of [[knowledge]] and ignorance? 

most assuredly. 
and is not the [[love]] of learning the [[love]] of [[wisdom]], which is [[philosophy]]?

they are the same, he replied. 
and may we not say confidently of [[man]] also, that he who is likely
to be gentle to his [[friends]] and acquaintances, must by [[nature]] be a
lover of [[wisdom]] and [[knowledge]]? 

that we may safely affirm. 
then he who is to be a really [[good]] and [[noble]] guardian of the state
will require to unite in himself [[philosophy]] and spirit and swiftness
and [[strength]]? 

undoubtedly. 
then we have found the [[desired]] natures [[nature]]; and now that we have found
them, how are they to be reared and educated? is not this enquiry
which may be expected to throw [[light]] on the greater enquiry which
is our final end --how do [[justice]] and [[injustice]] grow up in states?
for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw
out the argument to an inconvenient length. 

socrates - adeimantus 

adeimantus [[thought]] that the enquiry would be of [[great]] service to us.

then, i said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even
if somewhat long. 

certainly not. 
come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our
story shall be the [[education]] of our heroes. 

by all means. 
and what shall be their [[education]]? can we find a [[better]] than the traditional
sort? --and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the [[body]], and music
for the [[soul]]. 

true. 
shall we begin [[education]] with [[music]], and go on to gymnastic afterwards?

by all means. 
and when you speak of [[music]], do you include literature or not?

i do. 
and literature may be either true or false? 
yes. 
and the [[young]] should be trained in both kinds [[kind]], and we begin with the
false? 

i do not [[understand]] your meaning, he said. 
you [[know]], i said, that we begin by telling [[children]] stories which,
though not wholly destitute of [[truth]], are in the main fictitious;
and these stories are told them when they are not of an [[age]] to learn
gymnastics. 

very true. 
that was my meaning when i said that we must [[teach]] [[music]] before gymnastics.

quite [[right]], he said. 
you [[know]] also that the beginning is the most important part of any
work, especially in the case of a [[young]] and tender thing; for that
is the [[time]] at which the [[character]] is being formed and the desired
impression is more readily taken. 

quite true. 
and shall we just carelessly allow [[children]] to hear any casual tales
which may be devised by casual persons [[person]], and to receive into their
minds ideas [[idea]] for the most part the very opposite of those which we
should [[wish]] them to have when they are grown up? 

we cannot. 
then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers
of fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which
is [[good]], and reject the [[bad]]; and we will [[desire]] mothers [[mother]] and nurses
to tell their [[children]] the authorised ones only. let them fashion
the [[mind]] with such tales, even more fondly than they mould the body
with their hands; but most of those which are now in use must be discarded.

of what tales are you speaking? he said. 
you may find a model of the lesser in the greater, i said; for they
are necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in
both of them. 

very likely, he replied; but i do not as yet [[know]] what you would term
the greater. 

those, i said, which are narrated by [[homer]] and hesiod, and the rest
of the poets, who have ever been the [[great]] story-tellers of [[mankind]].

but which stories do you mean, he said; and what [[fault]] do you find
with them? 

a [[fault]] which is most serious, i said; the [[fault]] of telling a [[lie]],
and, what is more, a [[bad]] [[lie]]. 

but when is this [[fault]] committed? 
whenever an erroneous representation is made of the [[nature]] of gods
and heroes, --as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow
of a likeness to the original. 

yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blamable; but what
are the stories which you mean? 

first of all, i said, there was that [[greatest]] of all lies [[lie]], in high
places, which the poet told about uranus, and which was a [[bad]] lie
too, --i mean what hesiod says that uranus did, and how cronus retaliated
on him. the doings of cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his
son inflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not
to be lightly told to [[young]] and thoughtless persons [[person]]; if possible,
they had [[better]] be buried in [[silence]]. but if there is an absolute
necessity for their mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery,
and they should [[sacrifice]] not a [[common]] [eleusinian] pig, but some
huge and unprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers will
be very few indeed. 

why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.

yes, adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our [[state]];
the [[young]] [[man]] should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes
he is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises
his [[father]] when does [[wrong]], in whatever manner, he will only be following
the [[example]] of the first and [[greatest]] among the gods. 

i entirely agree with you, he said; in my [[opinion]] those stories are
quite unfit to be repeated. 

neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling
among themselves as of all things the basest, should any word be said
to them of the wars [[war]] in [[heaven]], and of the plots and fightings of the
gods against one another, for they are not true. no, we shall never
mention the battles [[battle]] of the giants, or let them be embroidered on garments;
and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods
and heroes with their [[friends]] and relatives. if they would only believe
us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy, and that never up
to this [[time]] has there been any, quarrel between [[citizens]]; this is
what old [[men]] and old [[women]] should begin by telling [[children]]; and when
they grow up, the poets also should be told to compose for them in
a similar spirit. but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his
mother, or how on another [[occasion]] [[zeus]] sent him flying for taking
her part when she was being beaten, and all the battles [[battle]] of the gods
in [[homer]] --these tales must not be admitted into our [[state]], whether
they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not. for a young
person cannot [[judge]] what is allegorical and what is literal; anything
that he receives into his [[mind]] at that [[age]] is likely to become indelible
and unalterable; and therefore it is most important that the tales
which the [[young]] first hear should be models of [[virtuous]] thoughts [[thought]].

there you are [[right]], he replied; but if any one asks where are such
models to be found and of what tales are you speaking --how shall
we [[answer]] him? 

i said to him, you and i, adeimantus, at this moment are not poets,
but founders of a [[state]]: now the founders of a [[state]] ought to know
the general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the
limits which must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not
their [[business]]. 

very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you
mean? 

something of this [[kind]], i replied: --god is always to be represented
as he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic,
in which the representation is given. 

right. 
and is he not truly [[good]]? and must he not be represented as such?

certainly. 
and no [[good]] thing is hurtful? 
no, indeed. 
and that which is not hurtful hurts not? 
certainly not. 
and that which hurts not does no [[evil]]? 
no. 
and can that which does no [[evil]] be a cause of [[evil]]? 
impossible. 
and the [[good]] is advantageous? 
yes. 
and therefore the cause of well-being? 
yes. 
it follows therefore that the [[good]] is not the cause of all things,
but of the [[good]] only? 

assuredly. 
then [[god]], if he be [[good]], is not the author of all things, as the many
assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most
things that occur to [[men]]. for few are the goods [[good]] of [[human]] [[life]], and
many are the evils [[evil]], and the [[good]] is to be attributed to [[god]] alone;
of the evils [[evil]] the causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.

that appears to me to be most true, he said. 
then we must not listen to [[homer]] or to any other poet who is guilty
of the folly of saying that two casks [[lie]] at the threshold of [[zeus]],
full of lots, one of [[good]], the other of [[evil]] lots, and that he to
whom [[zeus]] gives a mixture of the two sometimes meets with [[evil]] [[fortune]],
at other times [[time]] with [[good]]; but that he to whom is given the cup of
unmingled ill, 

him wild [[hunger]] drives o'er the beauteous [[earth]]. and again

zeus, who is the dispenser of [[good]] and [[evil]] to us. and if any one
asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, which was really
the [[work]] of pandarus, was brought about by athene and [[zeus]], or that
the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and
zeus, he shall not have our approval; neither will we allow our young
men to hear the words of aeschylus, that [[god]] plants guilt among men
when he desires [[desire]] utterly to [[destroy]] a house. and if a poet writes of
the sufferings of niobe --the [[subject]] of the tragedy in which these
iambic verses occur --or of the house of pelops, or of the trojan
war or on any similar theme, either we must not permit him to say
that these are the works [[work]] of [[god]], or if they are of [[god]], he must devise
some explanation of them such as we are seeking; he must say that
god did what was just and [[right]], and they were the [[better]] for being
punished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and that
god is the author of their misery --the poet is not to be permitted
to say; though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they
require to be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment
from [[god]]; but that [[god]] being [[good]] is the author of [[evil]] to any one
is to be strenuously denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in
verse or prose by any one whether old or [[young]] in any well-ordered
commonwealth. such a fiction is suicidal, ruinous, impious.

i agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to the
law. 

let this then be one of our rules [[rule]] and principles [[principle]] concerning the gods,
to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform --that
god is not the author of all things, but of [[good]] only. 

that will do, he said. 
and what do you [[think]] of a second [[principle]]? shall i ask you whether
god is a magician, and of a [[nature]] to appear insidiously now in one
shape, and now in another --sometimes himself changing and passing
into many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such
transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his
own proper image? 

i cannot [[answer]] you, he said, without more [[thought]]. 
well, i said; but if we suppose a [[change]] in anything, that change
must be effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?

most certainly. 
and things which are at their [[best]] are also least liable to be altered
or discomposed; for [[example]], when healthiest and strongest, the human
frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the
plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds
or the heat of the sun or any similar causes. 

of course. 
and will not the bravest and wisest [[soul]] be least confused or deranged
by any external influence? 

true. 
and the same [[principle]], as i should suppose, applies to all composite
things --furniture, houses, garments; when [[good]] and well made, they
are least altered by [[time]] and circumstances. 

very true. 
then everything which is [[good]], whether made by art [[arts]] or [[nature]], or both,
is least liable to suffer [[change]] from without? 

true. 
but surely [[god]] and the things of [[god]] are in every way [[perfect]]?

of course they are. 
then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many
shapes? 

he cannot. 
but may he not [[change]] and transform himself? 
clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.

and will he then [[change]] himself for the [[better]] and fairer, or for
the worse and more unsightly? 

if he [[change]] at all he can only [[change]] for the worse, for we cannot
suppose him to be deficient either in [[virtue]] or [[beauty]]. 

very true, adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether [[god]] or [[man]],
desire to make himself worse? 

impossible. 
then it is impossible that [[god]] should ever be willing to [[change]]; being,
as is supposed, the fairest and [[best]] that is conceivable, every god
remains absolutely and for ever in his own form. 

that necessarily follows, he said, in my [[judgment]]. 
then, i said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that

the gods, taking the [[disguise]] of strangers from other lands [[land]], walk
up and down cities [[city]] in all sorts of forms; and let no one slander proteus
and thetis, neither let any one, either in tragedy or in any other
kind of poetry, introduce here disguised in the likeness of a priestess
asking an alms 

for the life-giving daughters [[daughter]] of inachus the river of argos; --let
us have no more lies [[lie]] of that sort. neither must we have mothers [[mother]] under
the influence of the poets scaring their [[children]] with a [[bad]] version
of these myths --telling how [[certain]] gods, as they say, 'go about
by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms';
but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their [[children]], and
at the same [[time]] speak blasphemy against the gods. 

heaven forbid, he said. 
but although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft
and deception they may make us [[think]] that they appear in various forms?

perhaps, he replied. 
well, but can you imagine that [[god]] will be willing to [[lie]], whether
in word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself? 

i cannot say, he replied. 
do you not [[know]], i said, that the true [[lie]], if such an expression
may be allowed, is hated of gods and [[men]]? 

what do you mean? he said. 
i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest
and highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters;
there, above all, he is most afraid of a [[lie]] having possession of
him. 

still, he said, i do not comprehend you. 
the [[reason]] is, i replied, that you attribute some profound meaning
to my words; but i am only saying that deception, or being deceived
or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves,
which is the [[soul]], and in that part of them to have and to hold the
lie, is what [[mankind]] least like; --that, i say, is what they utterly
detest. 

there is nothing more hateful to them. 
and, as i was just now remarking, this ignorance in the [[soul]] of him
who is deceived may be called the true [[lie]]; for the [[lie]] in words is
only a [[kind]] of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection
of the [[soul]], not pure unadulterated falsehood. am i not [[right]]?

perfectly [[right]]. 
the true [[lie]] is hated not only by the gods, but also by [[men]]?

yes. 
whereas the [[lie]] in words is in [[certain]] cases useful and not hateful;
in dealing with enemies [[enemy]] --that would be an instance; or again, when
those whom we call our [[friends]] in a fit of madness or illusion are
going to do some harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine
or preventive; also in the tales of mythology, of which we were just
now speaking --because we do not [[know]] the [[truth]] about ancient times [[time]],
we make falsehood as much like [[truth]] as we can, and so turn it to
account. 

very true, he said. 
but can any of these reasons [[reason]] apply to [[god]]? can we suppose that he
is ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?

that would be ridiculous, he said. 
then the lying poet has no place in our [[idea]] of [[god]]? 
i should say not. 
or perhaps he may tell a [[lie]] because he is afraid of enemies [[enemy]]?

that is inconceivable. 
but he may have [[friends]] who are senseless or mad? 
but no mad or senseless [[person]] can be a friend of [[god]]. 
then no motive can be imagined why [[god]] should [[lie]]? 
none whatever. 
then the superhuman and [[divine]] is absolutely incapable of falsehood?

yes. 
then is [[god]] perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes
not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by [[dream]] or waking vision.

your thoughts [[thought]], he said, are the reflection of my own. 
you agree with me then, i said, that this is the second type or form
in which we should write and speak about [[divine]] things. the gods are
not magicians who transform themselves, neither do they [[deceive]] mankind
in any way. 

i grant that. 
then, although we are admirers of [[homer]], we do not [[admire]] the lying
dream which [[zeus]] sends to [[agamemnon]]; neither will we [[praise]] the verses
of aeschylus in which thetis says that [[apollo]] at her nuptials

was celebrating in [[song]] her [[fair]] progeny whose days were to he long,
and to [[know]] no sickness. and when he had spoken of my lot as in all
things blessed of [[heaven]] he raised a note of triumph and cheered my
soul. and i [[thought]] that the word of phoebus being [[divine]] and full
of prophecy, would not fail. and now he himself who uttered the strain,
he who was [[present]] at the banquet, and who said this --he it is who
has slain my [[son]]. 

these are the [[kind]] of sentiments about the gods which will arouse
our anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither
shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of
the [[young]], meaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as [[men]] can
be, should be true worshippers of the gods and like them.

i entirely agree, be said, in these principles [[principle]], and promise to make
them my laws [[law]]. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book iii

socrates - adeimantus 

such then, i said, are our principles [[principle]] of theology --some tales are
to be told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their
youth upwards, if we mean them to [[honour]] the gods and their parents,
and to value [[friendship]] with one another. 

yes; and i [[think]] that our principles [[principle]] are [[right]], he said.

but if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons
besides these, and lessons of such a [[kind]] as will take away the fear
of [[death]]? can any [[man]] be courageous who has the [[fear]] of [[death]] in him?

certainly not, he said. 
and can he be fearless of [[death]], or will he choose [[death]] in battle
rather than defeat and [[slavery]], who believes [[belief]] the [[world]] below to be
real and terrible? 

impossible. 
then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of
tales as well as over the others, and beg them not simply to but rather
to commend the [[world]] below, intimating to them that their descriptions
are untrue, and will do harm to our future warriors. 

that will be our [[duty]], he said. 
then, i said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages,
beginning with the verses, 

i would rather he a serf on the [[land]] of a [[poor]] and portionless man
than [[rule]] over all the [[dead]] who have come to nought. we must also
expunge the verse, which tells us how pluto feared, 

lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he
seen both of mortals and immortals [[immortal]]. and again: 

o heavens! verily in the house of [[hades]] there is [[soul]] and ghostly
form but no [[mind]] at all! again of tiresias: -- 

[to him even after [[death]] did persephone grant [[mind]],] that he alone
should be [[wise]]; but the other souls [[soul]] are flitting shades. again: --

the [[soul]] flying from the limbs had gone to [[hades]], lamentng her [[fate]],
leaving manhood and [[youth]]. again: -- 

and the [[soul]], with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the [[earth]].
and, -- 

as bats in hollow of mystic cavern, whenever any of the has dropped
out of the string and falls from the rock, fly shrilling and cling
to one another, so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they
moved. and we must beg [[homer]] and the other poets not to be angry if
we strike out these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical,
or unattractive to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical
charm of them, the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men
who are meant to be [[free]], and who should [[fear]] [[slavery]] more than [[death]].

undoubtedly. 
also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names
describe the [[world]] below --cocytus and styx, ghosts under the [[earth]],
and sapless shades, and any similar words of which the very mention
causes a shudder to pass through the inmost [[soul]] of him who hears
them. i do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use
of some [[kind]]; but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians
may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them. 

there is a real danger, he said. 
then we must have no more of them. 
true. 
another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us.

clearly. 
and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous
men? 

they will go with the rest. 
but shall we be [[right]] in getting rid of them? reflect: our principle
is that the [[good]] [[man]] will not consider [[death]] terrible to any other
good [[man]] who is his comrade. 

yes; that is our [[principle]]. 
and therefore he will not [[sorrow]] for his departed friend as though
he had [[suffered]] anything terrible? 

he will not. 
such an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself and
his own [[happiness]], and therefore is least in need of other [[men]].

true, he said. 
and for this [[reason]] the loss of a [[son]] or [[brother]], or the deprivation
of [[fortune]], is to him of all [[men]] least terrible. 

assuredly. 
and therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with
the [[greatest]] equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall
him. 

yes, he will [[feel]] such a misfortune far less than another.

then we shall be [[right]] in getting rid of the lamentations of famous
men, and making them over to [[women]] (and not even to [[women]] who are
good for anything), or to [[men]] of a baser sort, that those who are
being educated by us to be the defenders of their [[country]] may scorn
to do the like. 

that will be very [[right]]. 
then we will once more entreat [[homer]] and the other poets not to depict
achilles, who is the [[son]] of a [[goddess]], first lying on his side, then
on his back, and then on his face; then starting up and sailing in
a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea; now taking the sooty
ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head, or weeping
and wailing in the various modes which [[homer]] has delineated. nor should
he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching,

rolling in the dirt, calling each [[man]] loudly by his name. still more
earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods
lamenting and saying, 

alas! my misery! alas! that i bore the harvest to my [[sorrow]]. but if
he must introduce the gods, at any rate let him not dare so completely
to misrepresent the [[greatest]] of the gods, as to make him say --

o heavens! with my [[eyes]] verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased
round and round the [[city]], and my [[heart]] is sorrowful. or again: --

woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon, dearest of [[men]] to me,
subdued at the hands of patroclus the [[son]] of menoetius. for if, my
sweet adeimantus, our [[youth]] seriously listen to such unworthy representations
of the gods, instead of laughing at them as they ought, hardly will
any of them deem that he himself, being but a [[man]], can be dishonoured
by similar actions; neither will he rebuke any inclination which may
arise in his [[mind]] to say and do the like. and instead of having any
shame or self-control, he will be always whining and lamenting on
slight occasions [[occasion]]. 

yes, he said, that is most true. 
yes, i replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the argument
has just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until it is
disproved by a [[better]]. 

it ought not to be. 
neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter. for a fit of
laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces
a [[violent]] reaction. 

so i [[believe]]. 
then persons [[person]] of worth, even if only mortal [[men]], must not be represented
as overcome by laughter, and still less must such a representation
of the gods be allowed. 

still less of the gods, as you say, he replied. 
then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods
as that of [[homer]] when he describes how 

inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when they
saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion. on your views, we must
not admit them. 

on my views, if you like to [[father]] them on me; that we must not admit
them is [[certain]]. 

again, [[truth]] should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie
is useless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to [[men]], then
the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians; private
individuals have no [[business]] with them. 

clearly not, he said. 
then if any one at all is to have the [[privilege]] of lying, the rulers
of the [[state]] should be the persons [[person]]; and they, in their dealings either
with enemies [[enemy]] or with their own [[citizens]], may be allowed to [[lie]] for
the [[public]] [[good]]. but nobody else should meddle with anything of the
kind; and although the rulers have this [[privilege]], for a private man
to [[lie]] to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous [[fault]] than
for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth
about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer,
or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the
ship and the rest of the crew, and how things are going with himself
or his fellow sailors. 

most true, he said. 
if, then, the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the [[state]],

any of the craftsmen, whether he [[priest]] or physician or carpenter.
he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive
and destructive of ship or [[state]]. 

most certainly, he said, if our [[idea]] of the [[state]] is ever carried
out. 

in the next place our [[youth]] must be temperate? 
certainly. 
are not the [[chief]] elements of temperance, speaking generally, obedience
to commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures [[pleasure]]? 

true. 
then we shall approve such [[language]] as that of diomede in [[homer]],

friend, sit still and obey my word, and the verses which [[follow]],

the greeks [[greek]] marched breathing prowess, 
...in silent awe of their leaders, and other sentiments of the same
kind. 

we shall. 
what of this line, 

o heavy with wine, who hast the [[eyes]] of a dog and the [[heart]] of a stag,
and of the words which [[follow]]? would you say that these, or any similar
impertinences which private individuals [[individual]] are supposed to address to
their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?

they are ill spoken. 
they may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not conduce
to temperance. and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young
men --you would agree with me there? 

yes. 
and then, again, to make the wisest of [[men]] say that nothing in his
opinion is more glorious than 

when the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer carries
round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups, is
it fit or conducive to temperance for a [[young]] [[man]] to hear such words?
or the verse 

the saddest of fates [[fate]] is to [[die]] and meet [[destiny]] from [[hunger]]? what
would you say again to the tale of [[zeus]], who, while other gods and
men were asleep and he the only [[person]] awake, lay devising plans,
but forgot them all in a moment through his [[lust]], and was so completely
overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut,
but wanted to [[lie]] with her on the ground, declaring that he had never
been in such a [[state]] of rapture before, even when they first met one
another 

without the [[knowledge]] of their parents; or that other tale of how
hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast a chain around ares
and aphrodite? 

indeed, he said, i am strongly of [[opinion]] that they ought not to hear
that sort of thing. 

but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous [[men]], these
they ought to see and hear; as, for [[example]], what is said in the verses,

he smote his breast, and thus reproached his [[heart]], 
endure, my [[heart]]; far worse hast thou endured! 

certainly, he said. 
in the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers
of [[money]]. 

certainly not. 
neither must we sing to them of 

gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings [[king]]. neither is phoenix,
the tutor of achilles, to be approved or deemed to have given his
pupil [[good]] counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts
of the greeks [[greek]] and assist them; but that without a gift he should not
lay aside his anger. neither will we [[believe]] or acknowledge achilles
himself to have been such a lover of [[money]] that he took agamemnon's
or that when he had received payment he restored the [[dead]] [[body]] of
hector, but that without payment he was unwilling to do so.

undoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be approved.

loving [[homer]] as i do, i hardly like to say that in attributing these
feelings to achilles, or in believing that they are truly to him,
he is guilty of downright impiety. as little can i [[believe]] the narrative
of his insolence to [[apollo]], where he says, 

thou hast wronged me, o far-darter, most abominable of deities. verily
i would he even with thee, if i had only the [[power]], or his insubordination
to the river-god, on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands; or his
offering to the [[dead]] patroclus of his own hair, which had been previously
dedicated to the other river-god spercheius, and that he actually
performed this vow; or that he dragged [[hector]] round the tomb of patroclus,
and slaughtered the captives at the pyre; of all this i cannot believe
that he was guilty, any more than i can allow our [[citizens]] to believe
that he, the [[wise]] cheiron's pupil, the [[son]] of a [[goddess]] and of peleus
who was the gentlest of [[men]] and third in descent from [[zeus]], was so
disordered in his wits as to be at one [[time]] the [[slave]] of two seemingly
inconsistent [[passions]], meanness, not untainted by avarice, combined
with overweening contempt of gods and [[men]]. 

you are quite [[right]], he replied. 
and let us equally refuse to [[believe]], or allow to be repeated, the
tale of theseus [[son]] of poseidon, or of peirithous [[son]] of [[zeus]], going
forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero
or [[son]] of a [[god]] daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they
falsely ascribe to them in our day: and let us further compel the
poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them, or
that they were not the sons [[son]] of gods; --both in the same breath they
shall not be permitted to affirm. we will not have them trying to
persuade our [[youth]] that the gods are the authors of [[evil]], and that
heroes are no [[better]] than men-sentiments which, as we were saying,
are neither pious nor true, for we have already proved that [[evil]] cannot
come from the gods. 

assuredly not. 
and further they are likely to have a [[bad]] effect on those who hear
them; for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices [[vice]] when he is
convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by
-- 

the kindred of the gods, the relatives of [[zeus]], whose ancestral altar,
the attar of [[zeus]], is aloft in air on the peak of ida, and who have

the [[blood]] of deities yet flowing in their veins. and therefore let
us put an end to such tales, lest they engender laxity of morals [[moral]] among
the [[young]]. 

by all means, he replied. 
but now that we are determining what classes of subjects [[subject]] are or are
not to be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us.
the manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the [[world]] below
should be treated has been already laid down. 

very true. 
and what shall we say about [[men]]? that is clearly the remaining portion
of our [[subject]]. 

clearly so. 
but we are not in a condition to [[answer]] this [[question]] at [[present]],
my friend. 

why not? 
because, if i am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men
poets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements
when they tell us that wicked [[men]] are often [[happy]], and the [[good]] miserable;
and that [[injustice]] is profitable when undetected, but that justice
is a man's [[man]] own loss and another's gain --these things we shall forbid
them to utter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.

to be sure we shall, he replied. 
but if you admit that i am [[right]] in this, then i shall maintain that
you have implied the [[principle]] for which we have been all along contending.

i grant the [[truth]] of your inference. 
that such things are or are not to be said about [[men]] is a question
which we cannot determine until we have discovered what [[justice]] is,
and how naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seems
to be just or not. 

most true, he said. 
enough of the subjects [[subject]] of poetry: let us now speak of the style; and
when this has been considered, both matter and manner will have been
completely treated. 

i do not [[understand]] what you mean, said adeimantus. 
then i must make you [[understand]]; and perhaps i may be more intelligible
if i put the matter in this way. you are aware, i suppose, that all
mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either [[past]], [[present]],
or to come? 

certainly, he replied. 
and narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union
of the two? 

that again, he said, i do not quite [[understand]]. 
i [[fear]] that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty
in making myself apprehended. like a [[bad]] speaker, therefore, i will
not take the whole of the [[subject]], but will break a piece off in illustration
of my meaning. you [[know]] the first lines of the iliad, in which the
poet says that chryses prayed [[agamemnon]] to release his [[daughter]], and
that [[agamemnon]] flew into a passion with him; whereupon chryses, failing
of his object, invoked the anger of the [[god]] against the achaeans.
now as far as these lines, 

and he prayed all the greeks [[greek]], but especially the two sons [[son]] of atreus,
the chiefs [[chief]] of the [[people]], the poet is speaking in his own [[person]];
he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else. but in what
follows he takes the [[person]] of chryses, and then he does all that
he can to make us [[believe]] that the speaker is not [[homer]], but the aged
priest himself. and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative
of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout
the odyssey. 

yes. 
and a narrative it remains both in the speeches [[speech]] which the poet recites
from [[time]] to [[time]] and in the intermediate passages? 

quite true. 
but when the poet speaks in the [[person]] of another, may we not say
that he assimilates his style to that of the [[person]] who, as he informs
you, is going to speak? 

certainly. 
and this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of
voice or gesture, is the imitation of the [[person]] whose [[character]] he
assumes? 

of course. 
then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed
by way of imitation? 

very true. 
or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then
again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration.
however, in order that i may make my meaning quite clear, and that
you may no more say, i don't [[understand]],' i will show how the change
might be effected. if [[homer]] had said, 'the [[priest]] came, having his
daughter's ransom in his hands, supplicating the achaeans, and above
all the kings [[king]];' and then if, instead of speaking in the [[person]] of
chryses, he had continued in his own [[person]], the words would have
been, not imitation, but simple narration. the passage would have
run as follows (i am no poet, and therefore i drop the metre), 'the
priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks [[greek]] that they
might capture troy and return safely [[home]], but begged that they would
give him back his [[daughter]], and take the ransom which he brought,
and [[respect]] the [[god]]. thus he spoke, and the other greeks [[greek]] revered the
priest and assented. but [[agamemnon]] was wroth, and bade him depart
and not come again, lest the staff and chaplets of the [[god]] should
be of no avail to him --the [[daughter]] of chryses should not be released,
he said --she should grow old with him in argos. and then he told
him to go away and not to provoke him, if he intended to get home
unscathed. and the old [[man]] went away in [[fear]] and [[silence]], and, when
he had left the camp, he called upon [[apollo]] by his many names, reminding
him of everything which he had done pleasing to him, whether in building
his temples, or in offering [[sacrifice]], and praying that his [[good]] deeds
might be returned to him, and that the achaeans might expiate his
tears by the arrows of the [[god]],' --and so on. in this way the whole
becomes simple narrative. 

i [[understand]], he said. 
or you may suppose the opposite case --that the intermediate passages
are omitted, and the dialogue only left. 

that also, he said, i [[understand]]; you mean, for [[example]], as in tragedy.

you have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if i mistake not, what
you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you, that poetry
and mythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative --instances of
this are supplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite
style, in which the my poet is the only speaker --of this the dithyramb
affords the [[best]] [[example]]; and the combination of both is found in
epic, and in several other styles of poetry. do i take you with me?

yes, he said; i see now what you meant. 
i will ask you to [[remember]] also what i began by saying, that we had
done with the [[subject]] and might proceed to the style. 

yes, i [[remember]]. 
in saying this, i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding
about the mimetic art [[arts]], --whether the poets, in narrating their stories,
are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether in whole or
in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all imitation
be prohibited? 

you mean, i suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted
into our [[state]]? 

yes, i said; but there may be more than this in [[question]]: i really
do not [[know]] as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we
go. 

and go we will, he said. 
then, adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be
imitators; or rather, has not this [[question]] been decided by the rule
already laid down that one [[man]] can only do one thing well, and not
many; and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fall of gaining
much [[reputation]] in any? 

certainly. 
and this is equally true of imitation; no one [[man]] can imitate many
things as well as he would imitate a [[single]] one? 

he cannot. 
then the same [[person]] will hardly be able to play a serious part in
life, and at the same [[time]] to be an imitator and imitate many other
parts as well; for even when two [[species]] of imitation are nearly allied,
the same persons [[person]] cannot succeed in both, as, for [[example]], the writers
of tragedy and comedy --did you not just now call them imitations?

yes, i did; and you are [[right]] in thinking that the same persons [[person]] cannot
succeed in both. 

any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?

true. 
neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things
are but imitations. 

they are so. 
and [[human]] [[nature]], adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet
smaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well,
as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.

quite true, he replied. 
if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in [[mind]] that our
guardians, setting aside every other [[business]], are to dedicate themselves
wholly to the maintenance of [[freedom]] in the [[state]], making this their
craft, and engaging in no [[work]] which does not bear on this end, they
ought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they imitate at
all, they should imitate from [[youth]] upward only those characters [[character]] which
are suitable to their profession --the courageous, temperate, holy,
free, and the like; but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating
any [[kind]] of illiberality or baseness, lest from imitation they should
come to be what they imitate. did you never observe how imitations,
beginning in early [[youth]] and continuing far into [[life]], at length grow
into habits and become a second [[nature]], affecting [[body]], voice, and
mind? 

yes, certainly, he said. 
then, i said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a [[care]] and
of whom we say that they ought to be [[good]] [[men]], to imitate a woman,
whether [[young]] or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and
vaunting against the gods in conceit of her [[happiness]], or when she
is in affliction, or [[sorrow]], or weeping; and certainly not one who
is in sickness, [[love]], or [[labour]]. 

very [[right]], he said. 
neither must they represent slaves [[slave]], male or female, performing the
offices of slaves [[slave]]? 

they must not. 
and surely not [[bad]] [[men]], whether cowards or any others, who do the
reverse of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or
revile one another in drink or out of in drink or, or who in any other
manner [[sin]] against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed,
as the manner of such is. neither should they be trained to imitate
the action or [[speech]] of [[men]] or [[women]] who are mad or [[bad]]; for madness,
like [[vice]], is to be known but not to be practised or imitated.

very true, he replied. 
neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or
boatswains, or the like? 

how can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds
to the callings of any of these? 

nor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls,
the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that
sort of thing? 

nay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the behaviour
of madmen. 

you mean, i said, if i [[understand]] you aright, that there is one sort
of narrative style which may be employed by a truly [[good]] [[man]] when
he has anything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man
of an opposite [[character]] and [[education]]. 

and which are these two sorts? he [[asked]]. 
suppose, i answered, that a just and [[good]] [[man]] in the course of a narration
comes on some saying or action of another [[good]] [[man]], --i should imagine
that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of this
sort of imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the good
man when he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less [[degree]] when he
is overtaken by illness or [[love]] or drink, or has met with any other
disaster. but when he comes to a [[character]] which is unworthy of him,
he will not make a study of that; he will disdain such a [[person]], and
will assume his likeness, if at all, for a moment only when he is
performing some [[good]] action; at other times [[time]] he will be ashamed to
play a part which he has never practised, nor will he like to fashion
and frame himself after the baser models; he feels [[feel]] the employment
of such an art [[arts]], unless in jest, to be beneath him, and his [[mind]] revolts
at it. 

so i should expect, he replied. 
then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated
out of [[homer]], that is to say, his style will be both imitative and
narrative; but there will be very little of the former, and a great
deal of the latter. do you agree? 

certainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily
take. 

but there is another sort of [[character]] who will narrate anything,
and, the worse [[lie]] is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will
be too [[bad]] for him: and he will be ready to imitate anything, not
as a joke, but in [[right]] [[good]] earnest, and before a large company.
as i was just now saying, he will attempt to represent the roll of
thunder, the noise of wind and hall, or the creaking of wheels, and
pulleys, and the various sounds of flutes; pipes, trumpets, and all
sorts of instruments: he will bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep,
or crow like a cock; his entire art [[arts]] will consist in imitation of voice
and gesture, and there will be very little narration. 

that, he said, will be his mode of speaking. 
these, then, are the two kinds [[kind]] of style? 
yes. 
and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and
has but slight changes [[change]]; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen
for their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if hc speaks
correctly, is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep
within the limits of a [[single]] harmony (for the changes [[change]] are not great),
and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?

that is quite true, he said. 
whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of
rhythms, if the [[music]] and the style are to correspond, because the
style has all sorts of changes [[change]]. 

that is also perfectly true, he replied. 
and do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all
poetry, and every form of expression in words? no one can say anything
except in one or other of them or in both together. 

they include all, he said. 
and shall we receive into our [[state]] all the three styles, or one only
of the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?

i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of [[virtue]].

yes, i said, adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming:
and indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen
by you, is the most popular style with [[children]] and their attendants,
and with the [[world]] in general. 

i do not deny it. 
but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our
state, in which [[human]] [[nature]] is not twofold or manifold, for one man
plays one part only? 

yes; quite unsuitable. 
and this is the [[reason]] why in our [[state]], and in our [[state]] only, we
shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and
a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier
a soldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?

true, he said. 
and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are
so clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a
proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and
worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also
inform him that in our [[state]] such as he are not permitted to [[exist]];
the [[law]] will not allow them. and so when we have anointed him with
myrrh, and set a garland of wool upon his head, we shall send him
away to another [[city]]. for we mean to employ for our souls' health
the rougher and severer poet or story-teller, who will imitate the
style of the [[virtuous]] only, and will [[follow]] those models which we
prescribed at first when we began the [[education]] of our soldiers.

we certainly will, he said, if we have the [[power]]. 
then now, my friend, i said, that part of [[music]] or literary education
which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished;
for the matter and manner have both been discussed. 

i [[think]] so too, he said. 
next in order will [[follow]] melody and [[song]]. 
that is obvious. 
every one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are
to be consistent with ourselves. 

socrates - glaucon 

i [[fear]], said glaucon, laughing, that the words 'every one' hardly
includes me, for i cannot at the moment say what they should be; though
i may guess. 

at any rate you can tell that a [[song]] or ode has three parts --the
words, the melody, and the rhythm; that [[degree]] of [[knowledge]] i may
presuppose? 

yes, he said; so much as that you may. 
and as for the words, there surely be no difference words between
words which are and which are not set to [[music]]; both will conform
to the same laws [[law]], and these have been already determined by us?

yes. 
and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words? 
certainly. 
we were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no
need of lamentations and strains of [[sorrow]]? 

true. 
and which are the harmonies expressive of [[sorrow]]? you are musical,
and can tell me. 

the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian, and the
full-toned or bass lydian, and such like. 

these then, i said, must be [[banished]]; even to [[women]] who have a character
to maintain they are of no use, and much less to [[men]]. certainly.

in the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly
unbecoming the [[character]] of our guardians. 

utterly unbecoming. 
and which are the soft or drinking harmonies? 
the ionian, he replied, and the lydian; they are termed 'relaxed.'

well, and are these of any [[military]] use? 
quite the reverse, he replied; and if so the dorian and the phrygian
are the only ones which you have left. 

i answered: of the harmonies i [[know]] nothing, but i want to have one
warlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave [[man]] utters in the
hour of danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and
he is going to wounds or [[death]] or is overtaken by some other [[evil]],
and at every such crisis meets the blows of [[fortune]] with firm step
and a determination to endure; and another to be used by him in times
of [[peace]] and [[freedom]] of action, when there is no pressure of necessity,
and he is seeking to persuade [[god]] by prayer, or [[man]] by instruction
and admonition, or on the other hand, when he is expressing his willingness
to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition, and which represents
him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end, not carried away
by his [[success]], but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances,
and acquiescing in the event. these two harmonies i ask you to leave;
the strain of necessity and the strain of [[freedom]], the strain of the
unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate, the strain of [[courage]],
and the strain of temperance; these, i say, leave. 

and these, he replied, are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which
i was just now speaking. 

then, i said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs
and melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic
scale? 

i suppose not. 
then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners
and complex scales, or the makers of any other many-stringed curiously-harmonised
instruments? 

certainly not. 
but what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? would you admit
them into our [[state]] when you reflect that in this composite use of
harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together;
even the panharmonic [[music]] is only an imitation of the flute?

clearly not. 
there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the [[city]],
and the shepherds may have a pipe in the [[country]]. 

that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument.

the preferring of [[apollo]] and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments
is not at all [[strange]], i said. 

not at all, he replied. 
and so, by the dog of [[egypt]], we have been unconsciously purging the
state, which not long ago we termed luxurious. 

and we have done wisely, he replied. 
then let us now finish the purgation, i said. next in order to harmonies,
rhythms will naturally [[follow]], and they should be [[subject]] to the same
rules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems [[system]] of metre, or metres
of every [[kind]], but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions
of a courageous and harmonious [[life]]; and when we have found them,
we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit,
not the words to the foot and melody. to say what these rhythms are
will be your [[duty]] --you must [[teach]] me them, as you have already taught
me the harmonies. 

but, indeed, he replied, i cannot tell you. i only [[know]] that there
are some three principles [[principle]] of rhythm out of which metrical systems
are framed, just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all
the harmonies are composed; that is an observation which i have made.
but of what sort of lives [[life]] they are severally the imitations i am unable
to say. 

then, i said, we must take damon into our counsels; and he will tell
us what rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury,
or other unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression
of opposite feelings. and i [[think]] that i have an indistinct recollection
of his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic,
and he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite [[understand]],
making the rhythms [[equal]] in the rise and fall of the foot, long and
short alternating; and, unless i am mistaken, he spoke of an iambic
as well as of a trochaic rhythm, and assigned to them short and long
quantities. also in some cases he appeared to [[praise]] or censure the
movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm; or perhaps a combination
of the two; for i am not [[certain]] what he meant. these matters, however,
as i was saying, had [[better]] be referred to damon himself, for the
analysis of the [[subject]] would be difficult, you [[know]]. 

rather so, i should say. 
but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of
grace is an effect of [[good]] or [[bad]] rhythm. 

none at all. 
and also that [[good]] and [[bad]] rhythm naturally assimilate to a [[good]] and
bad style; and that harmony and discord in like manner [[follow]] style;
for our [[principle]] is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the
words, and not the words by them. 

just so, he said, they should [[follow]] the words. 
and will not the words and the [[character]] of the style depend on the
temper of the [[soul]]? 

yes. 
and everything else on the style? 
yes. 
then [[beauty]] of style and harmony and grace and [[good]] rhythm depend
on simplicity, --i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly
ordered [[mind]] and [[character]], not that other simplicity which is only
an euphemism for folly? 

very true, he replied. 
and if our [[youth]] are to do their [[work]] in [[life]], must they not make
these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim? 

they must. 
and surely the art [[arts]] of the painter and every other creative and constructive
art are full of them, --weaving, embroidery, architecture, and every
kind of manufacture; also [[nature]], animal and vegetable, --in all of
them there is grace or the absence of grace. and ugliness and discord
and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill [[nature]],
as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and [[virtue]] and
bear their likeness. 

that is quite true, he said. 
but shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only
to be required by us to express the image of the [[good]] in their works [[work]],
on [[pain]], if they do anything else, of expulsion from our [[state]]? or
is the same control to be extended to other artists, and are they
also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of [[vice]] and
intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building
and the other creative [[arts]]; and is he who cannot conform to this
rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art [[arts]] in our [[state]],
lest the taste of our [[citizens]] be corrupted by him? we would not have
our guardians grow up amid images of [[moral]] deformity, as in some noxious
pasture, and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower
day by day, little by little, until they silently gather a festering
mass of [[corruption]] in their own [[soul]]. let our artists rather be those
who are gifted to discern the true [[nature]] of the beautiful and graceful;
then will our [[youth]] dwell in a [[land]] of health, amid [[fair]] sights and
sounds, and receive the [[good]] in everything; and [[beauty]], the effluence
of [[fair]] works [[work]], shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving
breeze from a purer region, and insensibly draw the [[soul]] from earliest
years into likeness and sympathy with the [[beauty]] of [[reason]].

there can be no nobler training than that, he replied. 
and therefore, i said, glaucon, musical training is a more potent
instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way
into the inward places of the [[soul]], on which they mightily fasten,
imparting grace, and making the [[soul]] of him who is rightly educated
graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because
he who has received this true [[education]] of the inner being will most
shrewdly perceive omissions or faults [[fault]] in art [[arts]] and [[nature]], and with
a true taste, while he praises [[praise]] and rejoices over and receives into
his [[soul]] the [[good]], and becomes [[noble]] and [[good]], he will justly blame
and hate the [[bad]], now in the days of his [[youth]], even before he is
able to [[know]] the [[reason]] why; and when [[reason]] comes he will recognise
and salute the friend with whom his [[education]] has made him long familiar.

yes, he said, i quite agree with you in thinking that our [[youth]] should
be trained in [[music]] and on the grounds which you mention.

just as in learning to [[read]], i said, we were satisfied when we knew
the letters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring
sizes and combinations; not slighting them as unimportant whether
they occupy a space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them
out; and not thinking ourselves [[perfect]] in the art [[arts]] of reading until
we recognise them wherever they are found: 

true -- 
or, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in
a mirror, only when we [[know]] the letters themselves; the same art [[arts]] and
study giving us the [[knowledge]] of both: 

exactly -- 
even so, as i maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom we have
to educate, can ever become musical until we and they [[know]] the essential
forms, in all their combinations, and can recognise them and their
images wherever they are found, not slighting them either in small
things or [[great]], but believing them all to be within the sphere of
one art [[arts]] and study. 

most assuredly. 
and when a beautiful [[soul]] harmonises with a beautiful form, and the
two are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him
who has an eye to see it? 

the fairest indeed. 
and the fairest is also the loveliest? 
that may be assumed. 
and the [[man]] who has the spirit of harmony will be most in [[love]] with
the loveliest; but he will not [[love]] him who is of an inharmonious
soul? 

that is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his [[soul]]; but if
there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of
it, and will [[love]] all the same. 

i perceive, i said, that you have or have had experiences of this
sort, and i agree. but let me ask you another [[question]]: has excess
of [[pleasure]] any affinity to temperance? 

how can that be? he replied; [[pleasure]] deprives a [[man]] of the use of
his faculties quite as much as [[pain]]. 

or any affinity to [[virtue]] in general? 
none whatever. 
any affinity to wantonness and intemperance? 
yes, the [[greatest]]. 
and is there any greater or keener [[pleasure]] than that of sensual [[love]]?

no, nor a madder. 
whereas true [[love]] is a [[love]] of [[beauty]] and order --temperate and harmonious?

quite true, he said. 
then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true
love? 

certainly not. 
then mad or intemperate [[pleasure]] must never be allowed to come near
the lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it
if their [[love]] is of the [[right]] sort? 

no, indeed, [[socrates]], it must never come near them. 
then i suppose that in the [[city]] which we are founding you would make
a [[law]] to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity
to his [[love]] than a [[father]] would use to his [[son]], and then only for
a [[noble]] [[purpose]], and he must first have the other's [[consent]]; and this
rule is to limit him in all his intercourse, and he is never to be
seen going further, or, if he exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of
coarseness and [[bad]] taste. 

i quite agree, he said. 
thus much of [[music]], which makes a [[fair]] ending; for what should be
the end of [[music]] if not the [[love]] of [[beauty]]? 

i agree, he said. 
after [[music]] comes gymnastic, in which our [[youth]] are next to be trained.

certainly. 
gymnastic as well as [[music]] should begin in early years; the training
in it should be careful and should continue through [[life]]. now my belief
is, --and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion
in confirmation of my own, but my own [[belief]] is, --not that the good
body by any bodily excellence improves the [[soul]], but, on the contrary,
that the [[good]] [[soul]], by her own excellence, improves the [[body]] as far
as this may be possible. what do you say? 

yes, i agree. 
then, to the [[mind]] when adequately trained, we shall be [[right]] in handing
over the more particular [[care]] of the [[body]]; and in order to avoid prolixity
we will now only give the general outlines of the [[subject]].

very [[good]]. 
that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked
by us; for of all persons [[person]] a guardian should be the [[last]] to get drunk
and not [[know]] where in the [[world]] he is. 

yes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take
care of him is ridiculous indeed. 

but next, what shall we say of their food; for the [[men]] are in training
for the [[great]] contest of all --are they not? 

yes, he said. 
and will the habit of [[body]] of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?

why not? 
i am afraid, i said, that a habit of [[body]] such as they have is but
a sleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health. do you not
observe that these athletes sleep away their lives [[life]], and are liable
to most dangerous illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a [[degree]],
from their customary regimen? 

yes, i do. 
then, i said, a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior
athletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with
the utmost keenness; amid the many changes [[change]] of water and also of food,
of summer heat and winter cold, which they will have to endure when
on a campaign, they must not be liable to break down in health.

that is my view. 
the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music
which we were just now describing. 

how so? 
why, i conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our [[music]], is
simple and [[good]]; and especially the [[military]] gymnastic. 

what do you mean? 
my meaning may be learned from [[homer]]; he, you [[know]], feeds his heroes
at their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they
have no fish, although they are on the shores of the hellespont, and
they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food
most convenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light
a [[fire]], and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.

true. 
and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere
mentioned in [[homer]]. in proscribing them, however, he is not singular;
all professional athletes are well aware that a [[man]] who is to be in
good condition should take nothing of the [[kind]]. 

yes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite [[right]] in not taking
them. 

then you would not approve of syracusan dinners, and the refinements
of sicilian cookery? 

i [[think]] not. 
nor, if a [[man]] is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a
corinthian girl as his [[fair]] friend? 

certainly not. 
neither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are [[thought]],
of athenian confectionery? 

certainly not. 
all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody
and [[song]] composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms.
exactly. 

there complexity engendered license, and here disease; whereas simplicity
in [[music]] was the parent of temperance in the [[soul]]; and simplicity
in gymnastic of health in the [[body]]. 

most true, he said. 
but when intemperance and disease multiply in a [[state]], halls of justice
and medicine are always being opened; and the [[arts]] of the doctor and
the lawyer give themselves airs, finding how keen is the interest
which not only the slaves [[slave]] but the freemen of a [[city]] take about them.

of course. 
and yet what greater proof can there be of a [[bad]] and disgraceful state
of [[education]] than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort
of [[people]] need the [[skill]] of first-rate physicians and judges [[judge]], but
also those who would profess to have had a liberal [[education]]? is it
not disgraceful, and a [[great]] sign of want of good-breeding, that a
man should have to go abroad for his [[law]] and physic because he has
none of his own at [[home]], and must therefore [[surrender]] himself into
the hands of other [[men]] whom he makes lords [[lord]] and judges [[judge]] over him?

of all things, he said, the most disgraceful. 
would you say 'most,' i replied, when you consider that there is a
further stage of the [[evil]] in which a [[man]] is not only a life-long litigant,
passing all his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or defendant,
but is actually [[led]] by his [[bad]] taste to [[pride]] himself on his litigiousness;
he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty; able to take every
crooked turn, and wriggle into and out of every hole, bending like
a withy and getting out of the way of [[justice]]: and all for what? --in
order to gain small points not worth mentioning, he not knowing that
so to order his [[life]] as to be able to do without a napping [[judge]] is
a far higher and nobler sort of thing. is not that still more disgraceful?

yes, he said, that is still more disgraceful. 
well, i said, and to require the [[help]] of medicine, not when a wound
has to be cured, or on [[occasion]] of an epidemic, but just because,
by indolence and a habit of [[life]] such as we have been describing,
men fill themselves with waters and winds, as if their bodies [[body]] were
a marsh, compelling the ingenious sons [[son]] of asclepius to find more names
for diseases, such as flatulence and catarrh; is not this, too, a
disgrace? 

yes, he said, they do certainly give very [[strange]] and newfangled names
to diseases. 

yes, i said, and i do not [[believe]] that there were any such diseases
in the days of asclepius; and this i infer from the circumstance that
the hero eurypylus, after he has been wounded in [[homer]], drinks a posset
of pramnian wine well besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese,
which are certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons [[son]] of asclepius who
were at the trojan [[war]] do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink,
or rebuke patroclus, who is treating his case. 

well, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given
to a [[person]] in his condition. 

not so extraordinary, i replied, if you bear in [[mind]] that in former
days, as is commonly said, before the [[time]] of herodicus, the guild
of asclepius did not practise our [[present]] [[system]] of medicine, which
may be said to educate diseases. but herodicus, being a trainer, and
himself of a sickly [[constitution]], by a combination of training and
doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself,
and secondly the rest of the [[world]]. 

how was that? he said. 
by the invention of lingering [[death]]; for he had a mortal disease which
he perpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the [[question]], he
passed his entire [[life]] as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but
attend upon himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he departed
in anything from his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the help
of [[science]] he struggled on to old [[age]]. 

a rare [[reward]] of his skill! 
yes, i said; a [[reward]] which a [[man]] might fairly expect who never understood
that, if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian
arts, the omission arose, not from ignorance or inexperience of such
a branch of medicine, but because he knew that in all well-ordered
states every [[individual]] has an occupation to which he must attend,
and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill. this
we remark in the case of the artisan, but, ludicrously enough, do
not apply the same [[rule]] to [[people]] of the richer sort. 

how do you mean? he said. 
i mean this: when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough
and ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife, --these
are his remedies. and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics,
and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and all that
sort of thing, he replies at once that he has no [[time]] to be ill, and
that he sees no [[good]] in a [[life]] which is spent in nursing his disease
to the neglect of his customary employment; and therefore bidding
good-bye to this sort of physician, he resumes his ordinary habits,
and either gets well and lives [[life]] and does his [[business]], or, if his constitution
falls, he dies and has no more trouble. 

yes, he said, and a [[man]] in his condition of [[life]] ought to use the
art of medicine thus far only. 

has he not, i said, an occupation; and what [[profit]] would there be
in his [[life]] if he were deprived of his occupation? 

quite true, he said. 
but with the [[rich]] [[man]] this is otherwise; of him we do not say that
he has any specially appointed [[work]] which he must perform, if he would
live. 

he is generally supposed to have nothing to do. 
then you never heard of the saying of phocylides, that as soon as
a [[man]] has a livelihood he should practise [[virtue]]? 

nay, he said, i [[think]] that he had [[better]] begin somewhat sooner.

let us not have a dispute with him about this, i said; but rather
ask ourselves: is the practice of [[virtue]] obligatory on the [[rich]] [[man]],
or can he [[live]] without it? and if obligatory on him, then let us raise
a further [[question]], whether this dieting of disorders which is an
impediment to the application of the [[mind]] t in carpentering and the
mechanical [[arts]], does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment
of phocylides? 

of that, he replied, there can be no [[doubt]]; such excessive [[care]] of
the [[body]], when carried beyond the rules [[rule]] of gymnastic, is most inimical
to the practice of [[virtue]]. 

yes, indeed, i replied, and equally incompatible with the management
of a house, an [[army]], or an office of [[state]]; and, what is most important
of all, irreconcilable with any [[kind]] of study or [[thought]] or self-reflection
--there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to
be ascribed to [[philosophy]], and hence all practising or making trial
of [[virtue]] in the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for a [[man]] is
always fancying that he is being made ill, and is in constant anxiety
about the [[state]] of his [[body]]. 

yes, likely enough. 
and therefore our [[politic]] asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited
the [[power]] of his art [[arts]] only to persons [[person]] who, being generally of healthy
constitution and habits of [[life]], had a definite ailment; such as these
he cured by purges and operations, and bade them [[live]] as usual, herein
consulting the interests of the [[state]]; but bodies [[body]] which disease had
penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure
by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion: he did not want to
lengthen out good-for-nothing lives [[life]], or to have [[weak]] fathers [[father]] begetting
weaker sons [[son]]; --if a [[man]] was not able to [[live]] in the ordinary way he
had no [[business]] to cure him; for such a cure would have been of no
use either to himself, or to the [[state]]. 

then, he said, you regard asclepius as a statesman. 
clearly; and his [[character]] is further illustrated by his sons [[son]]. note
that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines
of which i am speaking at the siege of troy: you will [[remember]] how,
when pandarus wounded menelaus, they 

sucked the [[blood]] out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing remedies,
but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to [[eat]] or
drink in the case of menelaus, any more than in the case of eurypylus;
the remedies, as they conceived, were enough to heal any [[man]] who before
he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits; and even though
he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine, he might get well
all the same. but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and
intemperate subjects [[subject]], whose lives [[life]] were of no use either to themselves
or others; the art [[arts]] of medicine was not designed for their [[good]], and
though they were as [[rich]] as midas, the sons [[son]] of asclepius would have
declined to attend them. 

they were very acute persons [[person]], those sons [[son]] of asclepius. 
naturally so, i replied. nevertheless, the tragedians and pindar disobeying
our behests, although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son
of [[apollo]], say also that he was bribed into healing a [[rich]] [[man]] who
was at the point of [[death]], and for this [[reason]] he was struck by lightning.
but we, in accordance with the [[principle]] already affirmed by us, will
not [[believe]] them when they tell us both; --if he was the [[son]] of a
god, we maintain that hd was not avaricious; or, if he was avaricious
he was not the [[son]] of a [[god]]. 

all that, [[socrates]], is excellent; but i should like to put a question
to you: ought there not to be [[good]] physicians in a [[state]], and are
not the [[best]] those who have treated the [[greatest]] number of constitutions
good and [[bad]]? and are not the [[best]] judges [[judge]] in like manner those who
are acquainted with all sorts of [[moral]] natures [[nature]]? 

yes, i said, i too would have [[good]] judges [[judge]] and [[good]] physicians. but
do you [[know]] whom i [[think]] [[good]]? 

will you tell me? 
i will, if i can. let me however note that in the same [[question]] you
join two things which are not the same. 

how so? he [[asked]]. 
why, i said, you join physicians and judges [[judge]]. now the most skilful
physicians are those who, from their [[youth]] upwards, have combined
with the [[knowledge]] of their art [[arts]] the [[greatest]] [[experience]] of disease;
they had [[better]] not be robust in health, and should have had all manner
of diseases in their own persons [[person]]. for the [[body]], as i conceive, is
not the instrument with which they cure the [[body]]; in that case we
could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly; but they cure
the [[body]] with the [[mind]], and the [[mind]] which has become and is sick
can cure nothing. 

that is very true, he said. 
but with the [[judge]] it is otherwise; since he governs [[mind]] by [[mind]];
he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds [[mind]], and
to have associated with them from [[youth]] upwards, and to have gone
through the whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly
infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from
his own self-consciousness; the honourable [[mind]] which is to form a
healthy [[judgment]] should have had no [[experience]] or contamination of
evil habits when [[young]]. and this is the [[reason]] why in [[youth]] [[good]] men
often appear to be simple, and are easily practised upon by the dishonest,
because they have no examples [[example]] of what [[evil]] is in their own souls [[soul]].

yes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived. 
therefore, i said, the [[judge]] should not be [[young]]; he should have learned
to [[know]] [[evil]], not from his own [[soul]], but from late and long observation
of the [[nature]] of [[evil]] in others: [[knowledge]] should be his guide, not
personal [[experience]]. 

yes, he said, that is the ideal of a [[judge]]. 
yes, i replied, and he will be a [[good]] [[man]] (which is my [[answer]] to your
question); for he is [[good]] who has a [[good]] [[soul]]. but the cunning and
suspicious [[nature]] of which we spoke, --he who has committed many crimes,
and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst
his fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because
he judges [[judge]] of them by himself: but when he gets into the company of
men of [[virtue]], who have the [[experience]] of [[age]], he appears to be a
fool again, owing to his unseasonable suspicions; he cannot recognise
an honest [[man]], because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at
the same [[time]], as the [[bad]] are more numerous than the [[good]], and he
meets with them oftener, he thinks [[think]] himself, and is by others thought
to be, rather [[wise]] than foolish. 

most true, he said. 
then the [[good]] and [[wise]] [[judge]] whom we are seeking is not this [[man]],
but the other; for [[vice]] cannot [[know]] [[virtue]] too, but a [[virtuous]] [[nature]],
educated by [[time]], will acquire a [[knowledge]] both of [[virtue]] and [[vice]]:
the [[virtuous]], and not the vicious, [[man]] has [[wisdom]] --in my [[opinion]].

and in mine also. 
this is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of [[law]], which you
sanction in your [[state]]. they will minister to [[better]] natures [[nature]], giving
health both of [[soul]] and of [[body]]; but those who are diseased in their
bodies they will leave to [[die]], and the [[corrupt]] and incurable souls
they will put an end to themselves. 

that is clearly the [[best]] thing both for the patients and for the [[state]].

and thus our [[youth]], having been educated only in that simple music
which, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to
law. 

clearly. 
and the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to practise
the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine unless
in some extreme case. 

that i quite [[believe]]. 
the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate
the spirited element of his [[nature]], and not to increase his [[strength]];
he will not, like [[common]] athletes, use exercise and regimen to develop
his muscles. 

very [[right]], he said. 
neither are the two [[arts]] of [[music]] and gymnastic really designed, as
is often supposed, the one for the training of the [[soul]], the other
fir the training of the [[body]]. 

what then is the real object of them? 
i [[believe]], i said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly
the improvement of the [[soul]]. 

how can that be? he [[asked]]. 
did you never observe, i said, the effect on the [[mind]] itself of exclusive
devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion
to [[music]]? 

in what way shown? he said. 
the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of
softness and effeminacy, i replied. 

yes, he said, i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much
of a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond
what is [[good]] for him. 

yet surely, i said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if
rightly educated, would give [[courage]], but, if too much intensified,
is liable to become hard and brutal. 

that i quite [[think]]. 
on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.
and this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but,
if educated rightly, will be gentle and moderate. 

true. 
and in our [[opinion]] the guardians ought to have both these qualities?

assuredly. 
and both should be in harmony? 
beyond [[question]]. 
and the harmonious [[soul]] is both temperate and courageous?

yes. 
and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish? 
very true. 
and, when a [[man]] allows [[music]] to play upon him and to pour into his
soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy
airs of which we were just now speaking, and his whole [[life]] is passed
in warbling and the delights of [[song]]; in the first stage of the process
the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made
useful, instead of brittle and useless. but, if he carries on the
softening and soothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt
and waste, until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews
of his [[soul]]; and he becomes a feeble warrior. 

very true. 
if the element of spirit is naturally [[weak]] in him the [[change]] is speedily
accomplished, but if he have a [[good]] deal, then the [[power]] of music
weakening the spirit renders him excitable; --on the least provocation
he flames up at once, and is speedily extinguished; instead of having
spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable.

exactly. 
and so in gymnastics, if a [[man]] takes [[violent]] exercise and is a great
feeder, and the reverse of a [[great]] student of [[music]] and [[philosophy]],
at first the high condition of his [[body]] fills him with [[pride]] and spirit,
and [[lie]] becomes twice the [[man]] that he was. 

certainly. 
and what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no con-a verse
with the muses, does not even that [[intelligence]] which there may be
in him, having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought
or [[culture]], grow feeble and dull and blind, his [[mind]] never waking
up or receiving nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their
mists? 

true, he said. 
and he ends by becoming a hater of [[philosophy]], uncivilized, never
using the weapon of persuasion, --he is like a wild beast, all violence
and fierceness, and knows [[know]] no other way of dealing; and he lives [[life]] in
all ignorance and [[evil]] conditions, and has no sense of propriety and
grace. 

that is quite true, he said. 
and as there are two principles [[principle]] of [[human]] [[nature]], one the spirited
and the other the philosophical, some [[god]], as i should say, has given
mankind two [[arts]] answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul
and body), in order that these two principles [[principle]] (like the strings of
an instrument) may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly
harmonised. 

that appears to be the intention. 
and he who mingles [[music]] with gymnastic in the fairest proportions,
and [[best]] attempers them to the [[soul]], may be rightly called the true
musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the
strings. 

you are quite [[right]], [[socrates]]. 
and such a presiding genius will be always required in our [[state]] if
the [[government]] is to [[last]]. 

yes, he will be absolutely necessary. 
such, then, are our principles [[principle]] of nurture and [[education]]: where would
be the use of going into further details about the dances of our [[citizens]],
or about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian
contests? for these all [[follow]] the general [[principle]], and having found
that, we shall have no difficulty in discovering them. 

i dare say that there will be no difficulty. 
very [[good]], i said; then what is the next [[question]]? must we not ask
who are to be rulers and who subjects [[subject]]? 

certainly. 
there can be no [[doubt]] that the elder must [[rule]] the younger.

clearly. 
and that the [[best]] of these must [[rule]]. 
that is also clear. 
now, are not the [[best]] husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry?

yes. 
and as we are to have the [[best]] of guardians for our [[city]], must they
not be those who have most the [[character]] of guardians? 

yes. 
and to this end they ought to be [[wise]] and efficient, and to have a
special [[care]] of the [[state]]? 

true. 
and a [[man]] will be most likely to [[care]] about that which he loves [[love]]?

to be sure. 
and he will be most likely to [[love]] that which he regards as having
the same interests with himself, and that of which the [[good]] or evil
fortune is supposed by him at any [[time]] most to affect his own?

very true, he replied. 
then there must be a selection. let us note among the guardians those
who in their whole [[life]] show the [[greatest]] eagerness to do what is
for the [[good]] of their [[country]], and the [[greatest]] repugnance to do what
is against her interests. 

those are the [[right]] [[men]]. 
and they will have to be watched at every [[age]], in order that we may
see whether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence
either of [[force]] or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of
duty to the [[state]]. 

how cast off? he said. 
i will explain to you, i replied. a resolution may go out of a man's
mind either with his will or against his will; with his will when
he gets rid of a falsehood and learns [[better]], against his will whenever
he is deprived of a [[truth]]. 

i [[understand]], he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning
of the unwilling i have yet to learn. 

why, i said, do you not see that [[men]] are unwillingly deprived of [[good]],
and willingly of [[evil]]? is not to have lost the [[truth]] an [[evil]], and
to possess the [[truth]] a [[good]]? and you would agree that to conceive
things as they are is to possess the [[truth]]? 

yes, he replied; i agree with you in thinking that [[mankind]] are deprived
of [[truth]] against their will. 

and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or
force, or enchantment? 

still, he replied, i do not [[understand]] you. 
i [[fear]] that i must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians.
i only mean that some [[men]] are changed by persuasion and that others
forget; argument steals away the hearts [[heart]] of one class, and [[time]] of
the other; and this i call theft. now you [[understand]] me?

yes. 
those again who are forced are those whom the [[violence]] of some pain
or [[grief]] compels to [[change]] their [[opinion]]. 

i [[understand]], he said, and you are quite [[right]]. 
and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change
their minds [[mind]] either under the softer influence of [[pleasure]], or the
sterner influence of [[fear]]? 

yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.

therefore, as i was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best
guardians of their own conviction that what they [[think]] the interest
of the [[state]] is to be the [[rule]] of their lives [[life]]. we must watch them
from their [[youth]] upwards, and make them perform actions in which they
are most likely to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers
and is not deceived is to be selected, and he who falls in the trial
is to be rejected. that will be the way? 

yes. 
and there should also be toils and pains [[pain]] and conflicts prescribed
for them, in which they will be made to give further proof of the
same qualities. 

very [[right]], he replied. 
and then, i said, we must try them with enchantments that is the third
sort of test --and see what will be their behaviour: like those who
take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid [[nature]],
so must we take our [[youth]] amid terrors of some [[kind]], and again pass
them into pleasures [[pleasure]], and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved
in the furnace, that we may discover whether they are armed against
all enchantments, and of a [[noble]] bearing always, [[good]] guardians of
themselves and of the [[music]] which they have learned, and retaining
under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious [[nature]], such as
will be most serviceable to the [[individual]] and to the [[state]]. and he
who at every [[age]], as boy and [[youth]] and in mature [[life]], has come out
of the [[trial]] victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian
of the [[state]]; he shall be honoured in [[life]] and [[death]], and shall receive
sepulture and other memorials of [[honour]], the [[greatest]] that we have
to give. but him who fails, we must reject. i am inclined to think
that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should
be chosen and appointed. i speak generally, and not with any pretension
to exactness. 

and, speaking generally, i agree with you, he said. 
and perhaps the word 'guardian' in the fullest sense ought to be applied
to this higher class only who preserve us against [[foreign]] enemies
and maintain [[peace]] among our [[citizens]] at [[home]], that the one may not
have the will, or the others the [[power]], to harm us. the [[young]] men
whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries
and supporters of the principles [[principle]] of the rulers. 

i agree with you, he said. 
how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we
lately spoke --just one [[royal]] [[lie]] which may [[deceive]] the rulers, if
that be possible, and at any rate the rest of the [[city]]? 

what sort of [[lie]]? he said. 
nothing new, i replied; only an old phoenician tale of what has often
occurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have made
the [[world]] [[believe]],) though not in our [[time]], and i do not [[know]] whether
such an event could ever happen again, or could now even be made probable,
if it did. 

how your words seem to hesitate on your lips! 
you will not wonder, i replied, at my hesitation when you have heard.

speak, he said, and [[fear]] not. 
well then, i will speak, although i really [[know]] not how to look you
in the face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which
i propose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the
soldiers, and lastly to the [[people]]. they are to be told that their
youth was a [[dream]], and the [[education]] and training which they received
from us, an appearance only; in reality during all that [[time]] they
were being formed and fed in the womb of the [[earth]], where they themselves
and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were
completed, the [[earth]], their [[mother]], sent them up; and so, their country
being their [[mother]] and also their nurse, they are bound to advise
for her [[good]], and to defend her against attacks, and her citizens
they are to regard as [[children]] of the [[earth]] and their own brothers [[brother]].

you had [[good]] [[reason]], he said, to be ashamed of the [[lie]] which you were
going to tell. 

true, i replied, but there is more coming; i have only told you half.
citizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers [[brother]], yet
god has framed you differently. some of you have the [[power]] of command,
and in the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also
they have the [[greatest]] [[honour]]; others he has made of silver, to be
auxillaries; others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he
has composed of brass and iron; and the [[species]] will generally be
preserved in the [[children]]. but as all are of the same original stock,
a golden parent will sometimes have a silver [[son]], or a silver parent
a golden [[son]]. and [[god]] proclaims as a first [[principle]] to the rulers,
and above all else, that there is nothing which should so anxiously
guard, or of which they are to be such [[good]] guardians, as of the purity
of the [[race]]. they should observe what elements mingle in their off
spring; for if the [[son]] of a golden or silver parent has an admixture
of brass and iron, then [[nature]] orders a transposition of ranks, and
the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because
he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan,
just as there may be sons [[son]] of artisans who having an admixture of gold
or silver in them are raised to [[honour]], and become guardians or auxiliaries.
for an oracle says that when a [[man]] of brass or iron guards the [[state]],
it will be destroyed. such is the tale; is there any possibility of
making our [[citizens]] [[believe]] in it? 

not in the [[present]] [[generation]], he replied; there is no way of accomplishing
this; but their sons [[son]] may be made to [[believe]] in the tale, and their
sons' sons [[son]], and [[posterity]] after them. 

i see the difficulty, i replied; yet the fostering of such a belief
will make them [[care]] more for the [[city]] and for one another. enough,
however, of the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of
rumour, while we arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under
the command of their rulers. let them look round and select a spot
whence they can [[best]] suppress insurrection, if any prove refractory
within, and also defend themselves against enemies [[enemy]], who like wolves
may come down on the fold from without; there let them encamp, and
when they have encamped, let them [[sacrifice]] to the proper gods and
prepare their dwellings. 

just so, he said. 
and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold
of winter and the heat of summer. 

i suppose that you mean houses, he replied. 
yes, i said; but they must be the houses of soldiers, and not of shop-keepers.

what is the difference? he said. 
that i will endeavour to explain, i replied. to keep watchdogs, who,
from want of discipline or [[hunger]], or some [[evil]] habit, or [[evil]] habit
or other, would turn upon the sheep and worry them, and behave not
like dogs but wolves, would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?

truly monstrous, he said. 
and therefore every [[care]] must be taken that our auxiliaries, being
stronger than our [[citizens]], may not grow to be too much for them and
become savage tyrants [[tyrant]] instead of [[friends]] and allies? 

yes, [[great]] [[care]] should be taken. 
and would not a really [[good]] [[education]] furnish the [[best]] safeguard?

but they are well-educated already, he replied. 
i cannot be so confident, my dear glaucon, i said; i am much certain
that they ought to be, and that true [[education]], whatever that may
be, will have the [[greatest]] tendency to civilize and humanize them
in their relations to one another, and to those who are under their
protection. 

very true, he replied. 
and not only their [[education]], but their habitations, and all that
belongs to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue
as guardians, nor tempt them to prey upon the other [[citizens]]. any
man of sense must acknowledge that. 

he must. 
then let us consider what will be their way of [[life]], if they are to
realize our [[idea]] of them. in the first place, none of them should
have any [[property]] of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary;
neither should they have a private house or store closed against any
one who has a [[mind]] to enter; their provisions should be only such
as are required by trained warriors, who are [[men]] of temperance and
courage; they should agree to receive from the [[citizens]] a fixed rate
of [[pay]], enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more; and they
will go and [[live]] together like soldiers in a camp. gold and silver
we will tell them that they have from [[god]]; the diviner metal is within
them, and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current
among [[men]], and ought not to pollute the [[divine]] by any such earthly
admixture; for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy
deeds, but their own is undefiled. and they alone of all the citizens
may not touch or handle silver or gold, or be under the same roof
with them, or wear them, or drink from them. and this will be their
salvation, and they will be the saviours of the [[state]]. but should
they ever acquire homes [[home]] or lands [[land]] or moneys of their own, they will
become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians, enemies [[enemy]] and
tyrants instead of allies of the other [[citizens]]; hating and being
hated, plotting and being plotted against, they will pass their whole
life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies [[enemy]],
and the hour of ruin, both to themselves and to the rest of the [[state]],
will be at hand. for all which reasons [[reason]] may we not say that thus shall
our [[state]] be ordered, and that these shall be the regulations appointed
by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters?
other 

yes, said glaucon.

book iv

adeimantus - [[socrates]] 

here adeimantus interposed a [[question]]: how would you [[answer]], [[socrates]],
said he, if a [[person]] were to say that you are making these people
miserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the
city in [[fact]] belongs to them, but they are none the [[better]] for it;
whereas other [[men]] acquire lands [[land]], and build large and handsome houses,
and have everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to the
gods on their own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as
you were saying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that
is usual among the favourites of [[fortune]]; but our [[poor]] [[citizens]] are
no [[better]] than mercenaries who are quartered in the [[city]] and are always
mounting guard? 

yes, i said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid
in addition to their food, like other [[men]]; and therefore they cannot,
if they would, take a [[journey]] of [[pleasure]]; they have no [[money]] to spend
on a mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the [[world]] goes,
is [[thought]] to be [[happiness]]; and many other accusations of the same
nature might be added. 

but, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.

you mean to ask, i said, what will be our [[answer]]? 
yes. 
if we proceed along the old path, my [[belief]], i said, is that we shall
find the [[answer]]. and our [[answer]] will be that, even as they are, our
guardians may very likely be the happiest of [[men]]; but that our aim
in founding the [[state]] was not the disproportionate [[happiness]] of any
one class, but the [[greatest]] [[happiness]] of the whole; we [[thought]] that
in a [[state]] which is ordered with a view to the [[good]] of the whole we
should be most likely to find [[justice]], and in the ill-ordered state
injustice: and, having found them, we might then decide which of the
two is the happier. at [[present]], i take it, we are fashioning the happy
state, not piecemeal, or with a view of making a few [[happy]] [[citizens]],
but as a whole; and by-and-by we will proceed to view the opposite
kind of [[state]]. suppose that we were painting a statue, and some one
came up to us and said, why do you not put the most beautiful colours
on the most beautiful parts of the [[body]] --the [[eyes]] ought to be purple,
but you have made them black --to him we might fairly [[answer]], sir,
you would not surely have us beautify the [[eyes]] to such a [[degree]] that
they are no longer [[eyes]]; consider rather whether, by giving this and
the other features their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful.
and so i say to you, do not compel us to assign to the guardians a
sort of [[happiness]] which will make them anything but guardians; for
we too can clothe our husbandmen in [[royal]] apparel, and set crowns
of gold on their heads, and bid them till the ground as much as they
like, and no more. our potters also might be allowed to repose on
couches, and feast by the fireside, passing round the winecup, while
their wheel is conveniently at hand, and working at pottery only as
much as they like; in this way we might make every class happy-and
then, as you imagine, the whole [[state]] would be [[happy]]. but do not put
this [[idea]] into our heads; for, if we listen to you, the husbandman
will be no longer a husbandman, the potter will cease to be a potter,
and no one will have the [[character]] of any distinct class in the [[state]].
now this is not of much consequence where the [[corruption]] of [[society]],
and pretension to be what you are not, is confined to cobblers; but
when the guardians of the laws [[law]] and of the [[government]] are only seemingly
and not real guardians, then see how they turn the [[state]] upside down;
and on the other hand they alone have the [[power]] of giving order and
happiness to the [[state]]. we mean our guardians to be true saviours
and not the destroyers of the [[state]], whereas our opponent is thinking
of peasants at a festival, who are enjoying a [[life]] of revelry, not
of [[citizens]] who are doing their [[duty]] to the [[state]]. but, if so, we
mean different things, and he is speaking of something which is not
a [[state]]. and therefore we must consider whether in appointing our
guardians we would look to their [[greatest]] [[happiness]] individually,
or whether this [[principle]] of [[happiness]] does not rather reside in the
state as a whole. but the latter be the [[truth]], then the guardians
and auxillaries, and all others equally with them, must be compelled
or induced to do their own [[work]] in the [[best]] way. and thus the whole
state will grow up in a [[noble]] order, and the several classes will
receive the proportion of [[happiness]] which [[nature]] assigns to them.

i [[think]] that you are quite [[right]]. 
i wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to
me. 

what may that be? 
there seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the [[arts]].

what are they? 
wealth, i said, and [[poverty]]. 
how do they act? 
the process is as follows: when a potter becomes [[rich]], will he, think
you, any longer take the same pains [[pain]] with his art [[arts]]? 

certainly not. 
he will grow more and more indolent and careless? 
very true. 
and the result will be that he becomes a worse potter? 
yes; he greatly deteriorates. 
but, on the other hand, if he has no [[money]], and cannot provide himself
tools or instruments, he will not [[work]] equally well himself, nor will
he [[teach]] his sons [[son]] or apprentices to [[work]] equally well. 

certainly not. 
then, under the influence either of [[poverty]] or of [[wealth]], workmen
and their [[work]] are equally liable to degenerate? 

that is evident. 
here, then, is a discovery of new evils [[evil]], i said, against which the
guardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the [[city]] unobserved.

what evils [[evil]]? 
wealth, i said, and [[poverty]]; the one is the parent of luxury and indolence,
and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of discontent.

that is very true, he replied; but still i should like to [[know]], [[socrates]],
how our [[city]] will be able to go to [[war]], especially against an enemy
who is [[rich]] and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of [[war]].

there would certainly be a difficulty, i replied, in going to war
with one such [[enemy]]; but there is no difficulty where there are two
of them. 

how so? he [[asked]]. 
in the first place, i said, if we have to [[fight]], our side will be
trained warriors fighting against an [[army]] of [[rich]] [[men]]. 

that is true, he said. 
and do you not suppose, adeimantus, that a [[single]] boxer who was perfect
in his art [[arts]] would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do gentlemen
who were not boxers? 

hardly, if they came upon him at once. 
what, not, i said, if he were able to run away and then turn and strike
at the one who first came up? and supposing he were to do this several
times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert,
overturn more than one stout personage? 

certainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.

and yet [[rich]] [[men]] probably have a greater superiority in the science
and practice of boxing than they have in [[military]] qualities.

likely enough. 
then we may assume that our athletes will be able to [[fight]] with two
or three times [[time]] their own number? 

i agree with you, for i [[think]] you [[right]]. 
and suppose that, before engaging, our [[citizens]] send an embassy to
one of the two cities [[city]], telling them what is the [[truth]]: silver and
gold we neither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you
therefore come and [[help]] us in [[war]], of and take the spoils of the other
city: who, on hearing these words, would choose to [[fight]] against lean
wiry dogs, rather th than, with the dogs on their side, against fat
and tender sheep? 

that is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the [[poor]] state
if the [[wealth]] of many states were to be gathered into one.

but how simple of you to use the term [[state]] at all of any but our
own! 

why so? 
you ought to speak of other states in the plural number; not one of
them is a [[city]], but many cities [[city]], as they say in the game. for indeed
any [[city]], however small, is in [[fact]] divided into two, one the city
of the [[poor]], the other of the [[rich]]; these are at [[war]] with one another;
and in either there are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether
beside the mark if you treated them all as a [[single]] [[state]]. but if
you deal with them as many, and give the [[wealth]] or [[power]] or persons
of the one to the others, you will always have a [[great]] many friends
and not many enemies [[enemy]]. and your [[state]], while the [[wise]] order which has
now been prescribed continues to prevail in her, will be the greatest
of states, i do not mean to say in [[reputation]] or appearance, but in
deed and [[truth]], though she number not more than a thousand defenders.
a [[single]] [[state]] which is her [[equal]] you will hardly find, either among
hellenes or barbarians, though many that appear to be as [[great]] and
many times [[time]] greater. 

that is most true, he said. 
and what, i said, will be the [[best]] limit for our rulers to fix when
they are considering the size of the [[state]] and the amount of territory
which they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?

what limit would you propose? 
i would allow the [[state]] to increase so far as is consistent with unity;
that, i [[think]], is the proper limit. 

very [[good]], he said. 
here then, i said, is another order which will have to be conveyed
to our guardians: let our [[city]] be accounted neither large nor small,
but one and self-sufficing. 

and surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose
upon them. 

and the other, said i, of which we were speaking before is lighter
still, -i mean the [[duty]] of degrading the offspring of the guardians
when inferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring
of the lower classes, when naturally superior. the intention was,
that, in the case of the [[citizens]] generally, each [[individual]] should
be put to the use for which [[nature]] which [[nature]] intended him, one
to one [[work]], and then every [[man]] would do his own [[business]], and be
one and not many; and so the whole [[city]] would be one and not many.

yes, he said; that is not so difficult. 
the regulations which we are prescribing, my [[good]] adeimantus, are
not, as might be supposed, a number of [[great]] principles [[principle]], but trifles
all, if [[care]] be taken, as the saying is, of the one [[great]] thing, --a
thing, however, which i would rather call, not [[great]], but sufficient
for our [[purpose]]. 

what may that be? he [[asked]]. 
education, i said, and nurture: if our [[citizens]] are well educated,
and grow into sensible [[men]], they will easily see their way through
all these, as well as other matters which i omit; such, for [[example]],
as [[marriage]], the possession of [[women]] and the procreation of [[children]],
which will all [[follow]] the general [[principle]] that [[friends]] have all
things in [[common]], as the proverb says. 

that will be the [[best]] way of settling them. 
also, i said, the [[state]], if once started well, moves with accumulating
force like a wheel. for [[good]] nurture and [[education]] implant [[good]] constitutions [[constitution]],
and these [[good]] constitutions [[constitution]] taking root in a [[good]] [[education]] improve
more and more, and this improvement affects the breed in [[man]] as in
other animals. 

very possibly, he said. 
then to sum up: this is the point to which, above all, the attention
of our rulers should be directed, --that [[music]] and gymnastic be preserved
in their original form, and no innovation made. they must do their
utmost to maintain them intact. and when any one says that mankind
most regard 

the newest [[song]] which the singers have, they will be afraid that he
may be praising, not new songs [[song]], but a new [[kind]] of [[song]]; and this ought
not to be praised, or conceived to be the meaning of the poet; for
any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole [[state]], and ought
to be prohibited. so damon tells me, and i can quite [[believe]] him;-he
says that when modes of [[music]] [[change]], of the [[state]] always [[change]] with
them. 

yes, said adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to damon's and your
own. 

then, i said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress
in [[music]]? 

yes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals
in. 

yes, i replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears
harmless. 

why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by
little this spirit of licence, finding a [[home]], imperceptibly penetrates
into manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater [[force]], it invades
contracts between [[man]] and [[man]], and from contracts goes on to laws
and constitutions [[constitution]], in utter recklessness, ending at [[last]], [[socrates]],
by an overthrow of all rights [[right]], private as well as [[public]].

is that true? i said. 
that is my [[belief]], he replied. 
then, as i was saying, our [[youth]] should be trained from the first
in a stricter [[system]], for if amusements become lawless, and the youths
themselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted
and [[virtuous]] [[citizens]]. 

very true, he said. 
and when they have made a [[good]] beginning in play, and by the help
of [[music]] have gained the habit of [[good]] order, then this habit of order,
in a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany
them in all their actions and be a [[principle]] of [[growth]] to them, and
if there be any fallen places a [[principle]] in the [[state]] will raise
them up again. 

very true, he said. 
thus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules [[rule]] which
their predecessors have altogether neglected. 

what do you mean? 
i mean such things as these: --when the [[young]] are to be silent before
their elders; how they are to show [[respect]] to them by standing and
making them sit; what [[honour]] is due to parents; what garments or shoes
are to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners
in general. you would agree with me? 

yes. 
but there is, i [[think]], small [[wisdom]] in legislating about such matters,
--i [[doubt]] if it is ever done; nor are any precise written enactments
about them likely to be lasting. 

impossible. 
it would seem, adeimantus, that the direction in which [[education]] starts
a [[man]], will determine his future [[life]]. does not like always attract
like? 

to be sure. 
until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be [[good]],
and may be the reverse of [[good]]? 

that is not to be denied. 
and for this [[reason]], i said, i shall not attempt to legislate further
about them. 

naturally enough, he replied. 
well, and about the [[business]] of the agora, dealings and the ordinary
dealings between [[man]] and [[man]], or again about agreements with the commencement
with artisans; about insult and injury, of the commencement of actions,
and the appointment of juries, what would you say? there may also
arise questions [[question]] about any impositions and extractions of market and
harbour dues which may be required, and in general about the regulations
of markets, [[police]], harbours, and the like. but, oh heavens! shall
we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars? 

i [[think]], he said, that there is no need to impose laws [[law]] about them
on [[good]] [[men]]; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon
enough for themselves. 

yes, i said, my friend, if [[god]] will only preserve to them the laws
which we have given them. 

and without [[divine]] [[help]], said adeimantus, they will go on for ever
making and mending their laws [[law]] and their lives [[life]] in the [[hope]] of attaining
perfection. 

you would compare them, i said, to those invalids who, having no self-restraint,
will not leave off their habits of intemperance? 

exactly. 
yes, i said; and what a delightful [[life]] they lead! they are always
doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always
fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises
them to try. 

such cases are very [[common]], he said, with invalids of this sort.

yes, i replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their
worst [[enemy]] who tells them the [[truth]], which is simply that, unless
they give up eating and drinking and wenching and idling, neither
drug nor cautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.

charming! he replied. i see nothing charming in going into a passion
with a [[man]] who tells you what is [[right]]. 

these gentlemen, i said, do not seem to be in your [[good]] graces.

assuredly not. 
nor would you [[praise]] the behaviour of states which act like the men
whom i was just now describing. for are there not ill-ordered states
in which the [[citizens]] are forbidden under [[pain]] of [[death]] to alter the
constitution; and yet he who most sweetly courts those who [[live]] under
this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in
anticipating and gratifying their humours [[humour]] is held to be a [[great]] and
good statesman --do not these states resemble the persons [[person]] whom i was
describing? 

yes, he said; the states are as [[bad]] as the [[men]]; and i am very far
from praising them. 

but do you not [[admire]], i said, the coolness and dexterity of these
ready ministers of [[political]] [[corruption]]? 

yes, he said, i do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom
the applause of the multitude has deluded into the [[belief]] that they
are really statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.

what do you mean? i said; you should have more feeling for them. when
a [[man]] cannot measure, and a [[great]] many others who cannot measure declare
that he is four cubits high, can he [[help]] believing what they say?

nay, he said, certainly not in that case. 
well, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as [[good]] as
a play, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing;
they are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end
of frauds in contracts, and the other rascalities which i was mentioning,
not knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra?

yes, he said; that is just what they are doing. 
i conceive, i said, that the true legislator will not trouble himself
with this class of enactments whether concerning laws [[law]] or the constitution
either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered [[state]]; for in the former
they are quite useless, and in the latter there will be no difficulty
in devising them; and many of them will naturally flow out of our
previous regulations. 

what, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the [[work]] of legislation?

nothing to us, i replied; but to [[apollo]], the [[god]] of delphi, there
remains the ordering of the [[greatest]] and noblest and chiefest things
of all. 

which are they? he said. 
the institution of temples and sacrifices [[sacrifice]], and the entire service
of gods, demigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories
of the [[dead]], and the rites which have to be observed by him who would
propitiate the inhabitants of the [[world]] below. these are matters of
which we are ignorant ourselves, and as founders of a [[city]] we should
be unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity.
he is the [[god]] who sits in the center, on the navel of the [[earth]], and
he is the interpreter of [[religion]] to all [[mankind]]. 

you are [[right]], and we will do as you propose. 
but where, amid all this, is [[justice]]? [[son]] of ariston, tell me where.
now that our [[city]] has been made habitable, [[light]] a candle and search,
and get your [[brother]] and polemarchus and the rest of our [[friends]] to
help, and let us see where in it we can discover [[justice]] and where
injustice, and in what they differ from one another, and which of
them the [[man]] who would be [[happy]] should have for his portion, whether
seen or unseen by gods and [[men]]. 

socrates - glaucon 

nonsense, said glaucon: did you not promise to search yourself, saying
that for you not to [[help]] [[justice]] in her need would be an impiety?

i do not deny that i said so, and as you remind me, i will be as good
as my word; but you must join. 

we will, he replied. 
well, then, i [[hope]] to make the discovery in this way: i mean to begin
with the assumption that our [[state]], if rightly ordered, is [[perfect]].

that is most [[certain]]. 
and being [[perfect]], is therefore [[wise]] and valiant and temperate and
just. 

that is likewise clear. 
and whichever of these qualities we find in the [[state]], the one which
is not found will be the residue? 

very [[good]]. 
if there were four things, and we were searching for one of them,
wherever it might be, the one sought for might be known to us from
the first, and there would be no further trouble; or we might know
the other three first, and then the fourth would clearly be the one
left. 

very true, he said. 
and is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues [[virtue]], which
are also four in number? 

clearly. 
first among the virtues [[virtue]] found in the [[state]], [[wisdom]] comes into view,
and in this i detect a [[certain]] peculiarity. 

what is that? 
the [[state]] which we have been describing is said to be [[wise]] as being
good in counsel? 

very true. 
and [[good]] counsel is clearly a [[kind]] of [[knowledge]], for not by ignorance,
but by [[knowledge]], do [[men]] counsel well? 

clearly. 
and the kinds [[kind]] of [[knowledge]] in a [[state]] are many and diverse?

of course. 
there is the [[knowledge]] of the carpenter; but is that the sort of knowledge
which gives a [[city]] the title of [[wise]] and [[good]] in counsel?

certainly not; that would only give a [[city]] the [[reputation]] of skill
in carpentering. 

then a [[city]] is not to be called [[wise]] because possessing a knowledge
which counsels for the [[best]] about wooden implements? 

certainly not. 
nor by [[reason]] of a [[knowledge]] which advises about brazen pots, i said,
nor as possessing any other similar [[knowledge]]? 

not by [[reason]] of any of them, he said. 
nor yet by [[reason]] of a [[knowledge]] which cultivates the [[earth]]; that
would give the [[city]] the name of agricultural? 

yes. 
well, i said, and is there any [[knowledge]] in our recently founded state
among any of the [[citizens]] which advises, not about any particular
thing in the [[state]], but about the whole, and considers how a state
can [[best]] deal with itself and with other states? 

there certainly is. 
and what is [[knowledge]], and among whom is it found? i [[asked]].

it is the [[knowledge]] of the guardians, he replied, and found among
those whom we were just now describing as [[perfect]] guardians.

and what is the name which the [[city]] derives from the possession of
this sort of [[knowledge]]? 

the name of [[good]] in counsel and truly [[wise]]. 
and will there be in our [[city]] more of these true guardians or more
smiths? 

the smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous. 
will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive
a name from the profession of some [[kind]] of [[knowledge]]? 

much the smallest. 
and so by [[reason]] of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge
which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole
state, being thus constituted according to [[nature]], will be [[wise]]; and
this, which has the only [[knowledge]] worthy to be called [[wisdom]], has
been ordained by [[nature]] to be of all classes the least. 

most true. 
thus, then, i said, the [[nature]] and place in the [[state]] of one of the
four virtues [[virtue]] has somehow or other been discovered. 

and, in my humble [[opinion]], very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.

again, i said, there is no difficulty in seeing the [[nature]] of [[courage]];
and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous
to the [[state]]. 

how do you mean? 
why, i said, every one who calls any [[state]] courageous or cowardly,
will be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to [[war]] on the
state's behalf. 

no one, he replied, would ever [[think]] of any other. 
certainly not. 
the rest of the [[citizens]] may be courageous or may be cowardly but
their [[courage]] or cowardice will not, as i conceive, have the effect
of making the [[city]] either the one or the other. 

the [[city]] will be courageous in [[virtue]] of a portion of herself which
preserves under all circumstances that [[opinion]] about the [[nature]] of
things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated
them; and this is what you term [[courage]]. 

i should like to hear what you are saying once more, for i do not
think that i perfectly [[understand]] you. 

i mean that [[courage]] is a [[kind]] of salvation. 
salvation of what? 
of the [[opinion]] respecting things to be feared, what they are and of
what [[nature]], which the [[law]] implants through [[education]]; and i mean
by the words 'under all circumstances' to intimate that in pleasure
or in [[pain]], or under the influence of [[desire]] or [[fear]], a [[man]] preserves,
and does not lose this [[opinion]]. shall i give you an illustration?

if you please. 
you [[know]], i said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making
the true sea-purple, begin by selecting their [[white]] colour first;
this they prepare and dress with much [[care]] and pains [[pain]], in order that
the [[white]] ground may take the purple hue in full [[perfection]]. the dyeing
then proceeds; and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast
colour, and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away
the bloom. but, when the ground has not been duly prepared, you will
have noticed how [[poor]] is the look either of purple or of any other
colour. 

yes, he said; i [[know]] that they have a washed-out and ridiculous appearance.

then now, i said, you will [[understand]] what our object was in selecting
our soldiers, and educating them in [[music]] and gymnastic; we were contriving
influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws [[law]] in
perfection, and the colour of their [[opinion]] about dangers and of every
other [[opinion]] was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training,
not to be washed away by such potent lyes as [[pleasure]] --mightier agent
far in washing the [[soul]] than any soda or lye; or by [[sorrow]], [[fear]],
and [[desire]], the mightiest of all other solvents. and this sort of
universal saving [[power]] of true [[opinion]] in conformity with [[law]] about
real and false dangers i call and maintain to be [[courage]], unless you
disagree. 

but i agree, he replied; for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere
uninstructed [[courage]], such as that of a wild beast or of a [[slave]] --this,
in your [[opinion]], is not the [[courage]] which the [[law]] ordains, and ought
to have another name. 

most certainly. 
then i may infer [[courage]] to be such as you describe? 
why, yes, said i, you may, and if you add the words 'of a citizen,'
you will not be far [[wrong]]; --hereafter, if you like, we will carry
the examination further, but at [[present]] we are we w seeking not for
courage but [[justice]]; and for the [[purpose]] of our enquiry we have said
enough. 

you are [[right]], he replied. 
two virtues [[virtue]] remain to be discovered in the state-first temperance,
and then [[justice]] which is the end of our search. 

very true. 
now, can we find [[justice]] without troubling ourselves about temperance?

i do not [[know]] how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do i desire
that [[justice]] should be brought to [[light]] and temperance lost sight
of; and therefore i [[wish]] that you would do me the favour of considering
temperance first. 

certainly, i replied, i should not be justified in refusing your request.

then consider, he said. 
yes, i replied; i will; and as far as i can at [[present]] see, the virtue
of temperance has more of the [[nature]] of harmony and symphony than
the preceding. 

how so? he [[asked]]. 
temperance, i replied, is the ordering or controlling of [[certain]] pleasures
and desires [[desire]]; this is curiously enough implied in the saying of 'a
man being his own master' and other traces of the same notion may
be found in [[language]]. 

no [[doubt]], he said. 
there is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself';
for the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and
in all these modes of speaking the same [[person]] is denoted.

certainly. 
the meaning is, i [[believe]], that in the [[human]] [[soul]] there is a better
and also a worse [[principle]]; and when the [[better]] has the worse under
control, then a [[man]] is said to be master of himself; and this is a
term of [[praise]]: but when, owing to [[evil]] [[education]] or association,
the [[better]] [[principle]], which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by
the greater mass of the worse --in this case he is blamed and is called
the [[slave]] of [[self]] and unprincipled. 

yes, there is [[reason]] in that. 
and now, i said, look at our newly created [[state]], and there you will
find one of these two conditions realised; for the [[state]], as you will
acknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words 'temperance'
and 'self-mastery' truly express the [[rule]] of the [[better]] part over
the worse. 

yes, he said, i see that what you say is true. 
let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures [[pleasure]] and desires
and pains [[pain]] are generally found in [[children]] and [[women]] and servants,
and in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous
class. 

certainly, he said. 
whereas the simple and moderate desires [[desire]] which [[follow]] [[reason]], and are
under the guidance of [[mind]] and true [[opinion]], are to be found only
in a few, and those the [[best]] born and [[best]] educated. 

very true. these two, as you may perceive, have a place in our [[state]];
and the meaner desires [[desire]] of the are held down by the [[virtuous]] desires
and [[wisdom]] of the few. 

that i perceive, he said. 
then if there be any [[city]] which may be described as master of its
own pleasures [[pleasure]] and desires [[desire]], and master of itself, ours may claim such
a designation? 

certainly, he replied. 
it may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons [[reason]]?

yes. 
and if there be any [[state]] in which rulers and subjects [[subject]] will be agreed
as to the [[question]] who are to [[rule]], that again will be our [[state]]?

undoubtedly. 
and the [[citizens]] being thus agreed among themselves, in which class
will temperance be found --in the rulers or in the subjects [[subject]]?

in both, as i should imagine, he replied. 
do you observe that we were not far [[wrong]] in our guess that temperance
was a sort of harmony? 

why so? 
why, because temperance is unlike [[courage]] and [[wisdom]], each of which
resides in a part only, the one making the [[state]] [[wise]] and the other
valiant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs through
all the notes of the scale, and produces [[produce]] a harmony of the weaker and
the stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them to be
stronger or weaker in [[wisdom]] or [[power]] or numbers or [[wealth]], or anything
else. most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of
the naturally superior and inferior, as to the [[right]] to [[rule]] of either,
both in states and individuals [[individual]]. 

i entirely agree with you. 
and so, i said, we may consider three out of the four virtues [[virtue]] to have
been discovered in our [[state]]. the [[last]] of those qualities which make
a [[state]] [[virtuous]] must be [[justice]], if we only knew what that was.

the inference is obvious. 
the [[time]] then has arrived, glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should
surround the cover, and look sharp that [[justice]] does not steal away,
and pass out of sight and escape us; for beyond a [[doubt]] she is somewhere
in this [[country]]: watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her,
and if you see her first, let me [[know]]. 

would that i could! but you should regard me rather as a follower
who has just [[eyes]] enough to, see what you show him --that is about
as much as i am [[good]] for. 

offer up a prayer with me and [[follow]]. 
i will, but you must show me the way. 
here is no path, i said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; still
we must push on. 

let us push on. 
here i saw something: halloo! i said, i begin to perceive a track,
and i [[believe]] that the quarry will not escape. 

good news, he said. 
truly, i said, we are stupid fellows. 
why so? 
why, my [[good]] sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages [[age]] ago, there
was [[justice]] tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing
could be more ridiculous. like [[people]] who go about looking for what
they have in their hands --that was the way with us --we looked not
at what we were seeking, but at what was far off in the distance;
and therefore, i suppose, we missed her. 

what do you mean? 
i mean to say that in reality for a long [[time]] [[past]] we have been talking
of [[justice]], and have failed to recognise her. 

i grow impatient at the length of your exordium. 
well then, tell me, i said, whether i am [[right]] or not: you remember
the original [[principle]] which we were always laying down at the foundation
of the [[state]], that one [[man]] should practise one thing only, the thing
to which his [[nature]] was [[best]] adapted; --now [[justice]] is this principle
or a part of it. 

yes, we often said that one [[man]] should do one thing only.

further, we affirmed that [[justice]] was doing one's own [[business]], and
not being a busybody; we said so again and again, and many others
have said the same to us. 

yes, we said so. 
then to do one's own [[business]] in a [[certain]] way may be assumed to be
justice. can you tell me whence i derive this inference?

i cannot, but i should like to be told. 
because i [[think]] that this is the only [[virtue]] which remains in the
state when the other virtues [[virtue]] of temperance and [[courage]] and wisdom
are abstracted; and, that this is the ultimate cause and condition
of the existence of all of them, and while remaining in them is also
their preservative; and we were saying that if the three were discovered
by us, [[justice]] would be the fourth or remaining one. 

that follows of necessity. 
if we are [[asked]] to determine which of these four qualities by its
presence contributes most to the excellence of the [[state]], whether
the agreement of rulers and subjects [[subject]], or the preservation in the soldiers
of the [[opinion]] which the [[law]] ordains about the true [[nature]] of dangers,
or [[wisdom]] and watchfulness in the rulers, or whether this other which
i am mentioning, and which is found in [[children]] and [[women]], [[slave]] and
freeman, artisan, ruler, [[subject]], --the quality, i mean, of every
one doing his own [[work]], and not being a busybody, would claim the
palm --the [[question]] is not so easily answered. 

certainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying which.

then the [[power]] of each [[individual]] in the [[state]] to do his own work
appears to compete with the other [[political]] virtues [[virtue]], [[wisdom]], temperance,
courage. 

yes, he said. 
and the [[virtue]] which enters into this competition is [[justice]]?

exactly. 
let us look at the [[question]] from another point of view: are not the
rulers in a [[state]] those to whom you would entrust the office of determining
suits at [[law]]? 

certainly. 
and are suits decided on any other ground but that a [[man]] may neither
take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?

yes; that is their [[principle]]. 
which is a just [[principle]]? 
yes. 
then on this view also [[justice]] will be admitted to be the having and
doing what is a man's [[man]] own, and belongs to him? 

very true. 
think, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. suppose a carpenter
to be doing the [[business]] of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a carpenter;
and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties [[duty]], or
the same [[person]] to be doing the [[work]] of both, or whatever be the [[change]];
do you [[think]] that any [[great]] harm would result to the [[state]]?

not much. 
but when the cobbler or any other [[man]] whom [[nature]] designed to be a
trader, having his [[heart]] lifted up by [[wealth]] or [[strength]] or the number
of his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to [[force]] his way
into the class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators
and guardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements
or the duties [[duty]] of the other; or when one [[man]] is trader, legislator,
and warrior all in one, then i [[think]] you will agree with me in saying
that this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the
ruin of the [[state]]. 

most true. 
seeing then, i said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling
of one with another, or the [[change]] of one into another, is the greatest
harm to the [[state]], and may be most justly termed evil-doing?

precisely. 
and the [[greatest]] [[degree]] of evil-doing to one's own [[city]] would be termed
by you [[injustice]]? 

certainly. 
this then is [[injustice]]; and on the other hand when the trader, the
auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own [[business]], that is [[justice]],
and will make the [[city]] just. 

i agree with you. 
we will not, i said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on [[trial]], this
conception of [[justice]] be verified in the [[individual]] as well as in
the [[state]], there will be no longer any room for [[doubt]]; if it be not
verified, we must have a fresh enquiry. first let us complete the
old investigation, which we began, as you [[remember]], under the impression
that, if we could previously examine [[justice]] on the larger scale,
there would be less difficulty in discerning her in the [[individual]].
that larger [[example]] appeared to be the [[state]], and accordingly we constructed
as [[good]] a one as we could, knowing well that in the [[good]] [[state]] justice
would be found. let the discovery which we made be now applied to
the [[individual]] --if they agree, we shall be satisfied; or, if there
be a difference in the [[individual]], we will come back to the state
and have another [[trial]] of the theory. the friction of the two when
rubbed together may possibly strike a [[light]] in which [[justice]] will
shine forth, and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in
our souls [[soul]]. 

that will be in regular course; let us do as you say. 
i proceeded to ask: when two things, a greater and less, are called
by the same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called
the same? 

like, he replied. 
the just [[man]] then, if we regard the [[idea]] of [[justice]] only, will be
like the just [[state]]? 

he will. 
and a [[state]] was [[thought]] by us to be just when the three classes in
the [[state]] severally did their own [[business]]; and also [[thought]] to be
temperate and valiant and [[wise]] by [[reason]] of [[certain]] other affections
and qualities of these same classes? 

true, he said. 
and so of the [[individual]]; we may assume that he has the same three
principles in his own [[soul]] which are found in the [[state]]; and he may
be rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in
the same manner? 

certainly, he said. 
once more then, o my friend, we have alighted upon an easy question
--whether the [[soul]] has these three principles [[principle]] or not? 

an easy question! nay, rather, [[socrates]], the proverb holds that hard
is the [[good]]. 

very true, i said; and i do not [[think]] that the method which we are
employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this [[question]];
the true method is another and a longer one. still we may arrive at
a solution not below the level of the previous enquiry. 

may we not be satisfied with that? he said; --under the circumstances,
i am quite content. 

i too, i replied, shall be extremely well satisfied. 
then faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said. 
must we not acknowledge, i said, that in each of us there are the
same principles [[principle]] and habits which there are in the [[state]]; and that
from the [[individual]] they pass into the [[state]]? --how else can they
come there? take the quality of passion or spirit; --it would be ridiculous
to imagine that this quality, when found in states, is not derived
from the individuals [[individual]] who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the thracians,
scythians, and in general the northern nations; and the same may be
said of the [[love]] of [[knowledge]], which is the special characteristic
of our part of the [[world]], or of the [[love]] of [[money]], which may, with
equal [[truth]], be attributed to the phoenicians and [[egyptians]].

exactly so, he said. 
there is no difficulty in understanding this. 
none whatever. 
but the [[question]] is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether
these principles [[principle]] are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn
with one part of our [[nature]], are angry with another, and with a third
part [[desire]] the satisfaction of our [[natural]] appetites; or whether
the whole [[soul]] comes into play in each sort of action --to determine
that is the difficulty. 

yes, he said; there lies [[lie]] the difficulty. 
then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different.

how can we? he [[asked]]. 
i replied as follows: the same thing clearly cannot act or be acted
upon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same
time, in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction
occurs in things apparently the same, we [[know]] that they are really
not the same, but different. 

good. 
for [[example]], i said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at
the same [[time]] in the same part? 

impossible. 
still, i said, let us have a more precise statement of terms, lest
we should hereafter fall out by the way. imagine the case of a man
who is standing and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose
a [[person]] to say that one and the same [[person]] is in motion and at rest
at the same moment-to such a mode of [[speech]] we should object, and
should rather say that one part of him is in motion while another
is at rest. 

very true. 
and suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the
nice distinction that not only parts of tops, but whole tops, when
they spin round with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest and
in motion at the same [[time]] (and he may say the same of anything which
revolves in the same spot), his objection would not be admitted by
us, because in such cases things are not at rest and in motion in
the same parts of themselves; we should rather say that they have
both an axis and a circumference, and that the axis stands still,
for there is no deviation from the perpendicular; and that the circumference
goes round. but if, while revolving, the axis inclines either to the
right or left, forwards or backwards, then in no point of view can
they be at rest. 

that is the [[correct]] mode of describing them, he replied.

then none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe
that the same thing at the same [[time]], in the same part or in relation
to the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary ways.

certainly not, according to my way of thinking. 
yet, i said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections,
and prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume their absurdity,
and go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if this assumption
turn out to be untrue, all the consequences which [[follow]] shall be
withdrawn. 

yes, he said, that will be the [[best]] way. 
well, i said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire
and aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites,
whether they are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no
difference in the [[fact]] of their opposition)? 

yes, he said, they are opposites. 
well, i said, and [[hunger]] and thirst, and the desires [[desire]] in general, and
again willing and wishing, --all these you would refer to the classes
already mentioned. you would say --would you not? --that the soul
of him who desires [[desire]] is seeking after the object of his desires [[desire]]; or
that he is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes [[wish]] to possess:
or again, when a [[person]] wants anything to be given him, his [[mind]],
longing for the realisation of his desires [[desire]], intimates his [[wish]] to
have it by a nod of assent, as if he had been [[asked]] a [[question]]?

very true. 
and what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence
of [[desire]]; should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion
and rejection? 

certainly. 
admitting this to be true of [[desire]] generally, let us suppose a particular
class of desires [[desire]], and out of these we will select [[hunger]] and thirst,
as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them? 

let us take that class, he said. 
the object of one is food, and of the other drink? 
yes. 
and here comes the point: is not thirst the [[desire]] which the soul
has of drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything
else; for [[example]], warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word,
drink of any particular sort: but if the thirst be accompanied by
heat, then the [[desire]] is of cold drink; or, if accompanied by cold,
then of warm drink; or, if the thirst be excessive, then the drink
which is [[desired]] will be excessive; or, if not [[great]], the quantity
of drink will also be small: but thirst pure and simple will desire
drink pure and simple, which is the [[natural]] satisfaction of thirst,
as food is of [[hunger]]? 

yes, he said; the simple [[desire]] is, as you say, in every case of the
simple object, and the qualified [[desire]] of the qualified object.

but here a confusion may arise; and i should [[wish]] to guard against
an opponent starting up and saying that no [[man]] desires [[desire]] drink only,
but [[good]] drink, or food only, but [[good]] food; for [[good]] is the universal
object of [[desire]], and thirst being a [[desire]], will necessarily be thirst
after [[good]] drink; and the same is true of every other [[desire]].

yes, he replied, the opponent might have something to say.

nevertheless i should still maintain, that of relatives some have
a quality attached to either term of the relation; others are simple
and have their correlatives simple. 

i do not [[know]] what you mean. 
well, you [[know]] of course that the greater is relative to the less?

certainly. 
and the much greater to the much less? 
yes. 
and the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that
is to be to the less that is to be? 

certainly, he said. 
and so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as the
double and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter
and the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives; --is
not this true of all of them? 

yes. 
and does not the same [[principle]] hold in the sciences [[science]]? the object of
science is [[knowledge]] (assuming that to be the true definition), but
the object of a particular [[science]] is a particular [[kind]] of [[knowledge]];
i mean, for [[example]], that the [[science]] of house-building is a kind
of [[knowledge]] which is defined and distinguished from other kinds [[kind]] and
is therefore termed architecture. 

certainly. 
because it has a particular quality which no other has? 
yes. 
and it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular
kind; and this is true of the other [[arts]] and sciences [[science]]? 

yes. 
now, then, if i have made myself clear, you will [[understand]] my original
meaning in what i said about relatives. my meaning was, that if one
term of a relation is taken alone, the other is taken alone; if one
term is qualified, the other is also qualified. i do not mean to say
that relatives may not be disparate, or that the [[science]] of health
is healthy, or of disease necessarily diseased, or that the sciences
of [[good]] and [[evil]] are therefore [[good]] and [[evil]]; but only that, when
the term [[science]] is no longer used absolutely, but has a qualified
object which in this case is the [[nature]] of health and disease, it
becomes defined, and is hence called not merely [[science]], but the science
of medicine. 

i quite [[understand]], and i [[think]] as you do. 
would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative
terms, having clearly a relation -- 

yes, thirst is relative to drink. 
and a [[certain]] [[kind]] of thirst is relative to a [[certain]] [[kind]] of drink;
but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good
nor [[bad]], nor of any particular [[kind]] of drink, but of drink only?

certainly. 
then the [[soul]] of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, desires
only drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it? 

that is plain. 
and if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty [[soul]] away from
drink, that must be different from the thirsty [[principle]] which draws
him like a beast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same thing
cannot at the same [[time]] with the same part of itself act in contrary
ways about the same. 

impossible. 
no more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull
the bow at the same [[time]], but what you say is that one hand pushes
and the other pulls. 

exactly so, he replied. 
and might a [[man]] be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink? 
yes, he said, it constantly happens. 
and in such a case what is one to say? would you not say that there
was something in the [[soul]] bidding a [[man]] to drink, and something else
forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the [[principle]] which
bids him? 

i should say so. 
and the forbidding [[principle]] is derived from [[reason]], and that which
bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease? 

clearly. 
then we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ
from one another; the one with which [[man]] reasons [[reason]], we may call the
rational [[principle]] of the [[soul]], the other, with which he loves [[love]] and
hungers and thirsts and feels [[feel]] the flutterings of any other [[desire]],
may be termed the irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures
and satisfactions? 

yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.

then let us finally determine that there are two principles [[principle]] existing
in the [[soul]]. and what of passion, or spirit? is it a third, or akin
to one of the preceding? 

i should be inclined to say --akin to [[desire]]. 
well, i said, there is a story which i [[remember]] to have heard, and
in which i put [[faith]]. the story is, that leontius, the [[son]] of aglaion,
coming up one day from the piraeus, under the north wall on the outside,
observed some [[dead]] bodies [[body]] lying on the ground at the place of execution.
he [[felt]] a [[desire]] to see them, and also a dread and abhorrence of them;
for a [[time]] he struggled and covered his [[eyes]], but at length the desire
got the [[better]] of him; and forcing them open, he ran up to the dead
bodies, saying, look, ye wretches, take your fill of the [[fair]] sight.

i have heard the story myself, he said. 
the [[moral]] of the tale is, that anger at times [[time]] goes to [[war]] with [[desire]],
as though they were two distinct things. 

yes; that is the meaning, he said. 
and are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a
man's desires [[desire]] violently prevail over his [[reason]], he reviles himself,
and is angry at the [[violence]] within him, and that in this struggle,
which is like the struggle of factions in a [[state]], his spirit is on
the side of his [[reason]]; --but for the passionate or spirited element
to take part with the desires [[desire]] when [[reason]] that she should not be opposed,
is a sort of thing which thing which i [[believe]] that you never observed
occurring in yourself, nor, as i should imagine, in any one else?

certainly not. 
suppose that a [[man]] thinks [[think]] he has done a [[wrong]] to another, the nobler
he is the less able is he to [[feel]] indignant at any suffering, such
as [[hunger]], or cold, or any other [[pain]] which the injured [[person]] may
inflict upon him --these he deems to be just, and, as i say, his anger
refuses to be excited by them. 

true, he said. 
but when he thinks [[think]] that he is the sufferer of the [[wrong]], then he boils
and chafes, and is on the side of what he believes [[belief]] to be [[justice]];
and because he suffers [[hunger]] or cold or other [[pain]] he is only the
more determined to persevere and conquer. his [[noble]] spirit will not
be quelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the
voice of the shepherd, that is, [[reason]], bidding his dog bark no more.

the illustration is [[perfect]], he replied; and in our [[state]], as we were
saying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of
the rulers, who are their shepherds. 

i perceive, i said, that you quite [[understand]] me; there is, however,
a further point which i [[wish]] you to consider. 

what point? 
you [[remember]] that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be
a [[kind]] of [[desire]], but now we should say quite the contrary; for in
the conflict of the [[soul]] spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational
principle. 

most assuredly. 
but a further [[question]] arises: is passion different from [[reason]] also,
or only a [[kind]] of [[reason]]; in which latter case, instead of three principles
in the [[soul]], there will only be two, the [[rational]] and the concupiscent;
or rather, as the [[state]] was composed of three classes, traders, auxiliaries,
counsellors, so may there not be in the [[individual]] [[soul]] a third element
which is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by [[bad]] education
is the [[natural]] auxiliary of [[reason]] 

yes, he said, there must be a third. 
yes, i replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be different
from [[desire]], turn out also to be different from [[reason]]. 

but that is easily proved: --we may observe even in [[young]] children
that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas
some of them never seem to attain to the use of [[reason]], and most of
them late enough. 

excellent, i said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals,
which is a further proof of the [[truth]] of what you are saying. and
we may once more appeal to the words of [[homer]], which have been already
quoted by us, 

he smote his breast, and thus rebuked his [[soul]], for in this verse
homer has clearly supposed the [[power]] which reasons [[reason]] about the better
and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked
by it. 

very true, he said. 
and so, after much tossing, we have reached [[land]], and are fairly agreed
that the same principles [[principle]] which [[exist]] in the [[state]] [[exist]] also in the
individual, and that they are three in number. 

exactly. 
must we not then infer that the [[individual]] is [[wise]] in the same way,
and in [[virtue]] of the same quality which makes the [[state]] [[wise]]?

certainly. 
also that the same quality which constitutes [[courage]] in the state
constitutes [[courage]] in the [[individual]], and that both the [[state]] and
the [[individual]] bear the same relation to all the other virtues [[virtue]]?

assuredly. 
and the [[individual]] will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same
way in which the [[state]] is just? 

that follows, of course. 
we cannot but [[remember]] that the [[justice]] of the [[state]] consisted in
each of the three classes doing the [[work]] of its own class?

we are not very likely to have forgotten, he said. 
we must recollect that the [[individual]] in whom the several qualities
of his [[nature]] do their own [[work]] will be just, and will do his own
work? 

yes, he said, we must [[remember]] that too. 
and ought not the [[rational]] [[principle]], which is [[wise]], and has the care
of the whole [[soul]], to [[rule]], and the passionate or spirited principle
to be the [[subject]] and ally? 

certainly. 
and, as we were saying, the [[united]] influence of [[music]] and gymnastic
will bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the [[reason]] with
noble words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing
the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm? 

quite true, he said. 
and these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly
to [[know]] their own functions, will [[rule]] over the concupiscent, which
in each of us is the largest part of the [[soul]] and by [[nature]] most insatiable
of gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing [[great]] and strong
with the fulness of bodily pleasures [[pleasure]], as they are termed, the concupiscent
soul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should attempt to enslave
and [[rule]] those who are not her natural-born subjects [[subject]], and overturn
the whole [[life]] of [[man]]? 

very true, he said. 
both together will they not be the [[best]] defenders of the whole soul
and the whole [[body]] against attacks from without; the one counselling,
and the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing
his commands and counsels? 

true. 
and he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure
and in [[pain]] the commands of [[reason]] about what he ought or ought not
to [[fear]]? 

right, he replied. 
and him we call [[wise]] who has in him that little part which rules [[rule]],
and which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to
have a [[knowledge]] of what is for the interest of each of the three
parts and of the whole? 

assuredly. 
and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements
in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling [[principle]] of [[reason]], and
the two [[subject]] ones of spirit and [[desire]] are equally agreed that
reason ought to [[rule]], and do not rebel? 

certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether
in the [[state]] or [[individual]]. 

and surely, i said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue
of what quality a [[man]] will be just. 

that is very [[certain]]. 
and is [[justice]] dimmer in the [[individual]], and is her form different,
or is she the same which we found her to be in the [[state]]?

there is no difference in my [[opinion]], he said. 
because, if any [[doubt]] is still lingering in our minds [[mind]], a few commonplace
instances will satisfy us of the [[truth]] of what i am saying.

what sort of instances do you mean? 
if the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just [[state]], or
the [[man]] who is trained in the principles [[principle]] of such a [[state]], will be
less likely than the [[unjust]] to make away with a deposit of gold or
silver? would any one deny this? 

no one, he replied. 
will the just [[man]] or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft,
or treachery either to his [[friends]] or to his [[country]]? 

never. 
neither will he ever break [[faith]] where there have been oaths or agreements?

impossible. 
no one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his
father and [[mother]], or to fall in his [[religious]] duties [[duty]]? 

no one. 
and the [[reason]] is that each part of him is doing its own [[business]],
whether in ruling or being ruled? 

exactly so. 
are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such [[men]] and such
states is [[justice]], or do you [[hope]] to discover some other?

not i, indeed. 
then our [[dream]] has been realised; and the suspicion which we entertained
at the beginning of our [[work]] of construction, that some [[divine]] power
must have conducted us to a primary form of [[justice]], has now been
verified? 

yes, certainly. 
and the division of [[labour]] which required the carpenter and the shoemaker
and the rest of the [[citizens]] to be doing each his own [[business]], and
not another's, was a shadow of [[justice]], and for that [[reason]] it was
of use? 

clearly. 
but in reality [[justice]] was such as we were describing, being concerned
however, not with the outward [[man]], but with the inward, which is the
true [[self]] and concernment of [[man]]: for the just [[man]] does not permit
the several elements within him to interfere with one another, or
any of them to do the [[work]] of others, --he sets in order his own inner
life, and is his own master and his own [[law]], and at [[peace]] with himself;
and when he has bound together the three principles [[principle]] within him, which
may be compared to the higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale,
and the intermediate intervals --when he has bound all these together,
and is no longer many, but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly
adjusted [[nature]], then he proceeds to act, if he has to act, whether
in a matter of [[property]], or in the treatment of the [[body]], or in some
affair of [[politics]] or private [[business]]; always thinking and calling
that which preserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition,
just and [[good]] action, and the [[knowledge]] which presides over it, [[wisdom]],
and that which at any [[time]] impairs this condition, he will call unjust
action, and the [[opinion]] which presides over it ignorance.

you have said the exact [[truth]], [[socrates]]. 
very [[good]]; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just
man and the just [[state]], and the [[nature]] of [[justice]] in each of them,
we should not be telling a falsehood? 

most certainly not. 
may we say so, then? 
let us say so. 
and now, i said, [[injustice]] has to be considered. 
clearly. 
must not [[injustice]] be a strife which arises among the three principles
--a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of the
soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful [[authority]], which
is made by a rebellious [[subject]] against a true [[prince]], of whom he
is the [[natural]] vassal, --what is all this confusion and delusion but
injustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every
form of [[vice]]? 

exactly so. 
and if the [[nature]] of [[justice]] and [[injustice]] be known, then the meaning
of acting unjustly and being [[unjust]], or, again, of acting justly,
will also be perfectly clear? 

what do you mean? he said. 
why, i said, they are like disease and health; being in the [[soul]] just
what disease and health are in the [[body]]. 

how so? he said. 
why, i said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is
unhealthy causes disease. 

yes. 
and just actions cause [[justice]], and [[unjust]] actions cause [[injustice]]?

that is [[certain]]. 
and the creation of health is the institution of a [[natural]] order and
government of one by another in the parts of the [[body]]; and the creation
of disease is the production of a [[state]] of things at variance with
this [[natural]] order? 

true. 
and is not the creation of [[justice]] the institution of a [[natural]] order
and [[government]] of one by another in the parts of the [[soul]], and the
creation of [[injustice]] the production of a [[state]] of things at variance
with the [[natural]] order? 

exactly so, he said. 
then [[virtue]] is the health and [[beauty]] and well-being of the [[soul]], and
vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?

true. 
and do not [[good]] practices lead to [[virtue]], and [[evil]] practices to [[vice]]?

assuredly. 
still our old [[question]] of the comparative advantage of [[justice]] and
injustice has not been answered: which is the more profitable, to
be just and act justly and practise [[virtue]], whether seen or unseen
of gods and [[men]], or to be [[unjust]] and act unjustly, if only unpunished
and unreformed? 

in my [[judgment]], [[socrates]], the [[question]] has now become ridiculous.
we [[know]] that, when the bodily [[constitution]] is gone, [[life]] is no longer
endurable, though pampered with all kinds [[kind]] of meats and drinks, and
having all [[wealth]] and all [[power]]; and shall we be told that when the
very essence of the vital [[principle]] is undermined and corrupted, life
is still worth having to a [[man]], if only he be allowed to do whatever
he likes with the [[single]] exception that he is not to acquire justice
and [[virtue]], or to escape from [[injustice]] and [[vice]]; assuming them both
to be such as we have described? 

yes, i said, the [[question]] is, as you say, ridiculous. still, as we
are near the spot at which we may see the [[truth]] in the clearest manner
with our own [[eyes]], let us not faint by the way. 

certainly not, he replied. 
come up hither, i said, and behold the various forms of [[vice]], those
of them, i mean, which are worth looking at. 

i am following you, he replied: proceed. 
i said, the argument seems to have reached a height from which, as
from some tower of speculation, a [[man]] may look down and see that virtue
is one, but that the forms of [[vice]] are innumerable; there being four
special ones which are deserving of note. 

what do you mean? he said. 
i mean, i replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul
as there are distinct forms of the [[state]]. 

how many? 
there are five of the [[state]], and five of the [[soul]], i said.

what are they? 
the first, i said, is that which we have been describing, and which
may be said to have two names, [[monarchy]] and [[aristocracy]], accordingly
as [[rule]] is exercised by one distinguished [[man]] or by many.

true, he replied. 
but i regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether
the [[government]] is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have
been trained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental
laws of the [[state]] will be maintained. 

that is true, he replied. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book v

socrates - glaucon - adeimantus 

such is the [[good]] and true [[city]] or [[state]], and the [[good]] and [[man]] is of
the same pattern; and if this is [[right]] every other is [[wrong]]; and the
evil is one which affects not only the ordering of the [[state]], but
also the regulation of the [[individual]] [[soul]], and is exhibited in four
forms. 

what are they? he said. 
i was proceeding to tell the order in which the four [[evil]] forms appeared
to me to succeed one another, when pole marchus, who was sitting a
little way off, just beyond adeimantus, began to whisper to him: stretching
forth his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the
shoulder, and drew him towards him, leaning forward himself so as
to be quite close and saying something in his ear, of which i only
caught the words, 'shall we let him off, or what shall we do?

certainly not, said adeimantus, raising his voice. 
who is it, i said, whom you are refusing to let off? 
you, he said. 
i repeated, why am i especially not to be let off? 
why, he said, we [[think]] that you are lazy, and mean to [[cheat]] us out
of a whole [[chapter]] which is a very important part of the story; and
you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as
if it were self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women
and [[children]] 'friends have all things in [[common]].' 

and was i not [[right]], adeimantus? 
yes, he said; but what is [[right]] in this particular case, like everything
else, requires to be explained; for [[community]] may be of many kinds [[kind]].
please, therefore, to say what sort of [[community]] you mean. we have
been long expecting that you would tell us something about the family
life of your [[citizens]] --how they will bring [[children]] into the [[world]],
and rear them when they have arrived, and, in general, what is the
nature of this [[community]] of [[women]] and children-for we are of opinion
that the [[right]] or [[wrong]] management of such matters will have a great
and paramount influence on the [[state]] for [[good]] or for [[evil]]. and now,
since the [[question]] is still undetermined, and you are taking in hand
another [[state]], we have resolved, as you heard, not to let you go until
you give an account of all this. 

to that resolution, said glaucon, you may regard me as saying agreed.

socrates - adeimantus - glaucon - thrasymachus 

and without more ado, said thrasymachus, you may consider us all to
be equally agreed. 

i said, you [[know]] not what you are doing in thus assailing me: what
an argument are you raising about the state! just as i [[thought]] that
i had finished, and was only too glad that i had laid this question
to sleep, and was reflecting how fortunate i was in your acceptance
of what i then said, you ask me to begin again at the very foundation,
ignorant of what a hornet's nest of words you are stirring. now i
foresaw this gathering trouble, and avoided it. 

for what [[purpose]] do you conceive that we have come here, said thrasymachus,
--to look for gold, or to hear discourse? 

yes, but discourse should have a limit. 
yes, [[socrates]], said glaucon, and the whole of [[life]] is the only limit
which [[wise]] [[men]] assign to the hearing of such discourses. but never
mind about us; take [[heart]] yourself and [[answer]] the [[question]] in your
own way: what sort of [[community]] of [[women]] and [[children]] is this which
is to prevail among our guardians? and how shall we manage the period
between birth and [[education]], which seems to require the [[greatest]] [[care]]?
tell us how these things will be. 

yes, my simple friend, but the [[answer]] is the reverse of easy; many
more doubts [[doubt]] arise about this than about our previous conclusions.
for the practicability of what is said may be doubted; and looked
at in another point of view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable,
would be for the [[best]], is also doubtful. hence i [[feel]] a reluctance
to approach the [[subject]], lest our aspiration, my dear friend, should
turn out to be a [[dream]] only. 

fear not, he replied, for your audience will not be hard upon you;
they are not sceptical or hostile. 

i said: my [[good]] friend, i suppose that you mean to encourage me by
these words. 

yes, he said. 
then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the encouragement
which you offer would have been all very well had i myself believed
that i knew what i was talking about: to declare the [[truth]] about matters
of high interest which a [[man]] honours [[honour]] and loves [[love]] among [[wise]] [[men]] who
love him need [[occasion]] no [[fear]] or faltering in his [[mind]]; but to carry
on an argument when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer, which
is my condition, is a dangerous and slippery thing; and the danger
is not that i shall be laughed at (of which the [[fear]] would be childish),
but that i shall miss the [[truth]] where i have most need to be sure
of my footing, and drag my [[friends]] after me in my fall. and i pray
nemesis not to visit upon me the words which i am going to utter.
for i do indeed [[believe]] that to be an involuntary homicide is a less
crime than to be a deceiver about [[beauty]] or goodness or [[justice]] in
the matter of laws [[law]]. and that is a risk which i would rather run among
enemies than among [[friends]], and therefore you do well to encourage
me. 

glaucon laughed and said: well then, [[socrates]], in case you and your
argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand
of the and shall not be held to be a deceiver; take [[courage]] then and
speak. 

well, i said, the [[law]] says that when a [[man]] is acquitted he is free
from guilt, and what holds at [[law]] may hold in argument. 

then why should you [[mind]]? 
well, i replied, i suppose that i must retrace my steps and say what
i perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. the part
of the [[men]] has been played out, and now properly enough comes the
turn of the [[women]]. of them i will proceed to speak, and the more readily
since i am invited by you. 

for [[men]] born and educated like our [[citizens]], the only way, in my [[opinion]],
of arriving at a [[right]] conclusion about the possession and use of
women and [[children]] is to [[follow]] the path on which we originally started,
when we said that the [[men]] were to be the guardians and watchdogs of
the herd. 

true. 
let us further suppose the birth and [[education]] of our [[women]] to be
subject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see
whether the result accords with our design. 

what do you mean? 
what i mean may be put into the form of a [[question]], i said: are dogs
divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting
and in keeping watch and in the other duties [[duty]] of dogs? or do we entrust
to the males the entire and exclusive [[care]] of the flocks, while we
leave the females at [[home]], under the [[idea]] that the bearing and suckling
their puppies is [[labour]] enough for them? 

no, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is
that the males are stronger and the females weaker. 

but can you use different animals for the same [[purpose]], unless they
are bred and fed in the same way? 

you cannot. 
then, if [[women]] are to have the same duties [[duty]] as [[men]], they must have
the same nurture and [[education]]? 

yes. 
the [[education]] which was assigned to the [[men]] was [[music]] and gymnastic.
yes. 

then [[women]] must be taught [[music]] and gymnastic and also the art [[arts]] of
war, which they must practise like the [[men]]? 

that is the inference, i suppose. 
i should rather expect, i said, that several of our proposals, if
they are carried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.

no [[doubt]] of it. 
yes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women
naked in the palaestra, exercising with the [[men]], especially when they
are no longer [[young]]; they certainly will not be a vision of [[beauty]],
any more than the enthusiastic old [[men]] who in spite of wrinkles and
ugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia. 

yes, indeed, he said: according to [[present]] notions the proposal would
be [[thought]] ridiculous. 

but then, i said, as we have determined to speak our minds [[mind]], we must
not [[fear]] the jests of the wits which will be directed against this
sort of innovation; how they will talk of women's attainments both
in [[music]] and gymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and
riding upon horseback! 

very true, he replied. 
yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the [[law]];
at the same [[time]] begging of these gentlemen for once in their life
to be serious. not long ago, as we shall remind them, the hellenes
were of the [[opinion]], which is still generally received among the barbarians,
that the sight of a naked [[man]] was ridiculous and improper; and when
first the cretans and then the lacedaemonians introduced the custom,
the wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation.

no [[doubt]]. 
but when [[experience]] showed that to let all things be uncovered was
far [[better]] than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the
outward eye vanished before the [[better]] [[principle]] which [[reason]] asserted,
then the [[man]] was perceived to be a [[fool]] who directs the shafts of
his ridicule at any other sight but that of folly and [[vice]], or seriously
inclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of
the [[good]]. 

very true, he replied. 
first, then, whether the [[question]] is to be put in jest or in earnest,
let us come to an understanding about the [[nature]] of woman: is she
capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of [[men]],
or not at all? and is the art [[arts]] of [[war]] one of those [[arts]] in which she
can or can not share? that will be the [[best]] way of commencing the
enquiry, and will probably lead to the fairest conclusion.

that will be much the [[best]] way. 
shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves;
in this manner the adversary's position will not be undefended.

why not? he said. 
then let us put a [[speech]] into the mouths of our opponents. they will
say: 'socrates and glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you
yourselves, at the first foundation of the [[state]], admitted the principle
that everybody was to do the one [[work]] suited to his own [[nature]].' and
certainly, if i am not mistaken, such an admission was made by us.
'and do not the natures [[nature]] of [[men]] and [[women]] differ very much indeed?'
and we shall reply: of course they do. then we shall be [[asked]], 'whether
the tasks assigned to [[men]] and to [[women]] should not be different, and
such as are agreeable to their different natures [[nature]]?' certainly they
should. 'but if so, have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency
in saying that [[men]] and [[women]], whose natures [[nature]] are so entirely different,
ought to perform the same actions?' --what defence will you make for
us, my [[good]] sir, against any one who offers these objections?

that is not an easy [[question]] to [[answer]] when [[asked]] suddenly; and i
shall and i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.

these are the objections, glaucon, and there are many others of a
like [[kind]], which i foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant
to take in hand any [[law]] about the possession and nurture of women
and [[children]]. 

by [[zeus]], he said, the problem to be solved is anything but easy.

why yes, i said, but the [[fact]] is that when a [[man]] is out of his depth,
whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid-ocean,
he has to swim all the same. 

very true. 
and must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will [[hope]] that
arion's dolphin or some other miraculous [[help]] may save us?

i suppose so, he said. 
well then, let us see if any way of escape can be found. we acknowledged
--did we not? that different natures [[nature]] ought to have different pursuits,
and that men's and women's natures [[nature]] are different. and now what are
we saying? --that different natures [[nature]] ought to have the same pursuits,
--this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us. 

precisely. 
verily, glaucon, i said, glorious is the [[power]] of the art [[arts]] of contradiction!

why do you say so? 
because i [[think]] that many a [[man]] falls into the practice against his
will. when he thinks [[think]] that he is reasoning he is really disputing,
just because he cannot define and divide, and so [[know]] that of which
he is speaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the
spirit of contention and not of [[fair]] discussion. 

yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to
do with us and our argument? 

a [[great]] deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally
into a verbal opposition. 

in what way? 
why, we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal [[truth]], that
different natures [[nature]] ought to have different pursuits, but we never considered
at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of [[nature]], or
why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different
natures and the same to the same natures [[nature]]. 

why, no, he said, that was never considered by us. 
i said: suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question
whether there is not an opposition in [[nature]] between bald [[men]] and
hairy [[men]]; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald [[men]] are cobblers,
we should forbid the hairy [[men]] to be cobblers, and conversely?

that would be a jest, he said. 
yes, i said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we constructed
the [[state]], that the opposition of natures [[nature]] should extend to every difference,
but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which
the [[individual]] is engaged; we should have argued, for [[example]], that
a physician and one who is in [[mind]] a physician may be said to have
the same [[nature]]. 

true. 
whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures [[nature]]?

certainly. 
and if, i said, the male and female [[sex]] appear to differ in their
fitness for any art [[arts]] or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or
art ought to be assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference
consists only in [[women]] bearing and [[men]] begetting [[children]], this does
not amount to a proof that a woman differs from a [[man]] in [[respect]] of
the sort of [[education]] she should receive; and we shall therefore continue
to maintain that our guardians and their wives [[wife]] ought to have the same
pursuits. 

very true, he said. 
next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the pursuits
or [[arts]] of civic [[life]], the [[nature]] of a woman differs from that of
a [[man]]? 

that will be quite [[fair]]. 
and perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a sufficient
answer on the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection there
is no difficulty. 

yes, perhaps. 
suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument, and
then we may [[hope]] to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the
constitution of [[women]] which would affect them in the administration
of the [[state]]. 

by all means. 
let us say to him: come now, and we will ask you a [[question]]: --when
you spoke of a [[nature]] gifted or not gifted in any [[respect]], did you
mean to say that one [[man]] will acquire a thing easily, another with
difficulty; a little learning will lead the one to discover a great
deal; whereas the other, after much study and application, no sooner
learns than he forgets; or again, did you mean, that the one has a
body which is a [[good]] servant to his [[mind]], while the [[body]] of the other
is a hindrance to him?-would not these be the sort of differences
which distinguish the [[man]] gifted by [[nature]] from the one who is ungifted?

no one will deny that. 
and can you mention any pursuit of [[mankind]] in which the male [[sex]] has
not all these gifts and qualities in a higher [[degree]] than the female?
need i waste [[time]] in speaking of the art [[arts]] of weaving, and the management
of pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to
be [[great]], and in which for her to be beaten by a [[man]] is of all things
the most absurd? 

you are quite [[right]], he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority
of the female [[sex]]: although many [[women]] are in many things superior
to many [[men]], yet on the whole what you say is true. 

and if so, my friend, i said, there is no special faculty of administration
in a [[state]] which a woman has because she is a woman, or which a man
has by [[virtue]] of his [[sex]], but the gifts of [[nature]] are alike diffused
in both; all the pursuits of [[men]] are the pursuits of [[women]] also, but
in all of them a woman is inferior to a [[man]]. 

very true. 
then are we to impose all our enactments on [[men]] and none of them on
women? 

that will never do. 
one woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and
another has no [[music]] in her [[nature]]? 

very true. 
and one woman has a turn for gymnastic and [[military]] exercises, and
another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics? 

certainly. 
and one woman is a philosopher, and another is an [[enemy]] of [[philosophy]];
one has spirit, and another is without spirit? 

that is also true. 
then one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not.
was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences
of this sort? 

yes. 
men and [[women]] alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they
differ only in their comparative [[strength]] or weakness. 

obviously. 
and those [[women]] who have such qualities are to be selected as the
companions and colleagues of [[men]] who have similar qualities and whom
they resemble in capacity and in [[character]]? 

very true. 
and ought not the same natures [[nature]] to have the same pursuits?

they ought. 
then, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural in assigning
music and gymnastic to the wives [[wife]] of the guardians --to that point
we come round again. 

certainly not. 
the [[law]] which we then enacted was agreeable to [[nature]], and therefore
not an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice,
which prevails at [[present]], is in reality a violation of [[nature]].

that appears to be true. 
we had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and
secondly whether they were the most beneficial? 

yes. 
and the possibility has been acknowledged? 
yes. 
the very [[great]] benefit has next to be established? 
quite so. 
you will admit that the same [[education]] which makes a [[man]] a [[good]] guardian
will make a woman a [[good]] guardian; for their original [[nature]] is the
same? 

yes. 
i should like to ask you a [[question]]. 
what is it? 
would you say that all [[men]] are [[equal]] in excellence, or is one man
better than another? 

the latter. 
and in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the
guardians who have been brought up on our model [[system]] to be more
perfect [[men]], or the cobblers whose [[education]] has been cobbling?

what a ridiculous question! 
you have answered me, i replied: well, and may we not further say
that our guardians are the [[best]] of our [[citizens]]? 

by far the [[best]]. 
and will not their wives [[wife]] be the [[best]] [[women]]? 
yes, by far the [[best]]. 
and can there be anything [[better]] for the interests of the [[state]] than
that the [[men]] and [[women]] of a [[state]] should be as [[good]] as possible?

there can be nothing [[better]]. 
and this is what the [[arts]] of [[music]] and gymnastic, when [[present]] in
such manner as we have described, will accomplish? 

certainly. 
then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest
degree beneficial to the [[state]]? 

true. 
then let the wives [[wife]] of our guardians strip, for their [[virtue]] will be
their robe, and let them share in the toils of [[war]] and the defence
of their [[country]]; only in the distribution of labours [[labour]] the lighter
are to be assigned to the [[women]], who are the weaker natures [[nature]], but in
other respects [[respect]] their duties [[duty]] are to be the same. and as for the man
who laughs at naked [[women]] exercising their bodies [[body]] from the [[best]] of
motives, in his laughter he is plucking 

a fruit of unripe [[wisdom]], and he himself is ignorant of what he is
laughing at, or what he is about; --for that is, and ever will be,
the [[best]] of sayings, that the useful is the [[noble]] and the hurtful
is the base. 

very true. 
here, then, is one difficulty in our [[law]] about [[women]], which we may
say that we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive
for enacting that the guardians of either [[sex]] should have all their
pursuits in [[common]]; to the utility and also to the possibility of
this arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears
witness. 

yes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped. 
yes, i said, but a greater is coming; you will of this when you see
the next. 

go on; let me see. 
the [[law]], i said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded,
is to the following effect, --'that the wives [[wife]] of our guardians are
to be [[common]], and their [[children]] are to be [[common]], and no parent is
to [[know]] his own child, nor any child his parent.' 

yes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and the
possibility as well as the utility of such a [[law]] are far more questionable.

i do not [[think]], i said, that there can be any dispute about the very
great utility of having wives [[wife]] and [[children]] in [[common]]; the possibility
is quite another matter, and will be very much disputed.

i [[think]] that a [[good]] many doubts [[doubt]] may be raised about both.

you imply that the two questions [[question]] must be combined, i replied. now
i meant that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as i [[thought]];
i should escape from one of them, and then there would remain only
the possibility. 

but that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please
to give a defence of both. 

well, i said, i submit to my [[fate]]. yet grant me a little favour: let
me feast my [[mind]] with the [[dream]] as day dreamers are in the habit of
feasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have
discovered any means of effecting their wishes [[wish]] --that is a matter
which never troubles them --they would rather not tire themselves
by thinking about possibilities; but assuming that what they desire
is already granted to them, they proceed with their plan, and delight
in detailing what they mean to do when their [[wish]] has come true --that
is a way which they have of not doing much [[good]] to a capacity which
was never [[good]] for much. now i myself am beginning to lose [[heart]],
and i should like, with your permission, to pass over the question
of possibility at [[present]]. assuming therefore the possibility of the
proposal, i shall now proceed to enquire how the rulers will carry
out these arrangements, and i shall demonstrate that our plan, if
executed, will be of the [[greatest]] benefit to the [[state]] and to the
guardians. first of all, then, if you have no objection, i will endeavour
with your [[help]] to consider the advantages of the measure; and hereafter
the [[question]] of possibility. 

i have no objection; proceed. 
first, i [[think]] that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be
worthy of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey
in the one and the [[power]] of command in the other; the guardians must
themselves obey the laws [[law]], and they must also imitate the spirit of
them in any details which are entrusted to their [[care]]. 

that is [[right]], he said. 
you, i said, who are their legislator, having selected the [[men]], will
now select the [[women]] and give them to them; --they must be as far
as possible of like natures [[nature]] with them; and they must [[live]] in common
houses and meet at [[common]] meals, none of them will have anything specially
his or her own; they will be together, and will be brought up together,
and will associate at gymnastic exercises. and so they will be drawn
by a necessity of their natures [[nature]] to have intercourse with each other
--necessity is not too [[strong]] a word, i [[think]]? 

yes, he said; --necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of necessity
which lovers [[know]], and which is far more convincing and constraining
to the mass of [[mankind]]. 

true, i said; and this, glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed after
an orderly [[fashion]]; in a [[city]] of the blessed, licentiousness is an
unholy thing which the rulers will forbid. 

yes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted. 
then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony [[sacred]] in the
highest [[degree]], and what is most beneficial will be deemed [[sacred]]?

exactly. 
and how can marriages [[marriage]] be made most beneficial? --that is a question
which i put to you, because i see in your house dogs for hunting,
and of the nobler sort of birds not a few. now, i beseech you, do
tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?

in what particulars? 
why, in the first place, although they are all of a [[good]] sort, are
not some [[better]] than others? 

true. 
and do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care
to breed from the [[best]] only? 

from the [[best]]. 
and do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe
age? 

i choose only those of ripe [[age]]. 
and if [[care]] was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would
greatly deteriorate? 

certainly. 
and the same of horses and animals in general? 
undoubtedly. 
good heavens! my dear friend, i said, what consummate [[skill]] will our
rulers need if the same [[principle]] holds of the [[human]] species!

certainly, the same [[principle]] holds; but why does this involve any
particular [[skill]]? 

because, i said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the body
corporate with medicines. now you [[know]] that when patients do not require
medicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the inferior sort
of practitioner is deemed to be [[good]] enough; but when medicine has
to be given, then the doctor should be more of a [[man]]. 

that is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?

i mean, i replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of
falsehood and deceit necessary for the [[good]] of their subjects [[subject]]: we
were saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines
might be of advantage. 

and we were very [[right]]. 
and this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the
regulations of marriages [[marriage]] and births. 

how so? 
why, i said, the [[principle]] has been already laid down that the best
of either [[sex]] should be [[united]] with the [[best]] as often, and the inferior
with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear
the offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the
flock is to be maintained in first-rate condition. now these goings
on must be a secret which the rulers only [[know]], or there will be a
further danger of our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking
out into rebellion. 

very true. 
had we not [[better]] appoint [[certain]] festivals at which we will bring
together the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices [[sacrifice]] will be offered
and suitable hymeneal songs [[song]] composed by our poets: the number of weddings
is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose
aim will be to preserve the average of [[population]]? there are many
other things which they will have to consider, such as the effects
of wars [[war]] and diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as
this is possible to prevent the [[state]] from becoming either too large
or too small. 

certainly, he replied. 
we shall have to invent some ingenious [[kind]] of lots which the less
worthy may draw on each [[occasion]] of our bringing them together, and
then they will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers.

to be sure, he said. 
and i [[think]] that our braver and [[better]] [[youth]], besides their other
honours and rewards [[reward]], might have greater facilities of intercourse
with [[women]] given them; their bravery will be a [[reason]], and such fathers
ought to have as many sons [[son]] as possible. 

true. 
and the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices
are to be held by [[women]] as well as by [[men]] -- 

yes -- 
the proper officers will take the offspring of the [[good]] parents to
the pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with [[certain]] nurses
who dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior,
or of the [[better]] when they [[chance]] to be deformed, will be put away
in some mysterious, unknown place, as they should be. 

yes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to
be kept pure. 

they will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers [[mother]] to
the fold when they are full of milk, taking the [[greatest]] possible
care that no [[mother]] recognizes her own child; and other wet-nurses
may be engaged if more are required. [[care]] will also be taken that
the process of suckling shall not be protracted too long; and the
mothers will have no getting up at night or other trouble, but will
hand over all this sort of thing to the nurses and attendants.

you suppose the wives [[wife]] of our guardians to have a fine easy [[time]] of
it when they are having [[children]]. 

why, said i, and so they ought. let us, however, proceed with our
scheme. we were saying that the parents should be in the prime of
life? 

very true. 
and what is the prime of [[life]]? may it not be defined as a period of
about twenty years in a woman's [[life]], and thirty in a man's [[man]]?

which years do you mean to include? 
a woman, i said, at twenty years of [[age]] may begin to bear children
to the [[state]], and continue to bear them until forty; a [[man]] may begin
at five-and-twenty, when he has passed the point at which the pulse
of [[life]] beats quickest, and continue to beget [[children]] until he be
fifty-five. 

certainly, he said, both in [[men]] and [[women]] those years are the prime
of physical as well as of intellectual vigour. 

any one above or below the prescribed ages [[age]] who takes part in the public
hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing;
the child of which he is the [[father]], if it steals into [[life]], will
have been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices [[sacrifice]] and
prayers, which at each hymeneal priestesses and [[priest]] and the whole
city will offer, that the new [[generation]] may be [[better]] and more useful
than their [[good]] and useful parents, whereas his child will be the
offspring of darkness and [[strange]] [[lust]]. 

very true, he replied. 
and the same [[law]] will apply to any one of those within the prescribed
age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of [[life]] without
the sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up
a bastard to the [[state]], uncertified and unconsecrated. 

very true, he replied. 
this applies, however, only to those who are within the specified
age: after that we allow them to range at will, except that a man
may not [[marry]] his [[daughter]] or his daughter's [[daughter]], or his mother
or his mother's [[mother]]; and [[women]], on the other hand, are prohibited
from marrying their sons [[son]] or fathers [[father]], or son's [[son]] or father's [[father]],
and so on in either direction. and we grant all this, accompanying
the permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may
come into being from seeing the [[light]]; and if any [[force]] a way to the
birth, the parents must [[understand]] that the offspring of such an union
cannot be maintained, and arrange accordingly. 

that also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. but how will they
know who are fathers [[father]] and daughters [[daughter]], and so on? 

they will never [[know]]. the way will be this: --dating from the day
of the hymeneal, the bridegroom who was then [[married]] will call all
the male [[children]] who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards
his sons [[son]], and the female [[children]] his daughters [[daughter]], and they will call
him [[father]], and he will call their [[children]] his grandchildren, and
they will call the elder [[generation]] grandfathers and grandmothers.
all who were begotten at the [[time]] when their fathers [[father]] and mothers [[mother]] came
together will be called their brothers [[brother]] and sisters, and these, as
i was saying, will be forbidden to inter-marry. this, however, is
not to be understood as an absolute prohibition of the [[marriage]] of
brothers and sisters; if the lot favours them, and they receive the
sanction of the pythian oracle, the [[law]] will allow them.

quite [[right]], he replied. 
such is the scheme, glaucon, according to which the guardians of our
state are to have their wives [[wife]] and families [[family]] in [[common]]. and now you
would have the argument show that this [[community]] is consistent with
the rest of our polity, and also that nothing can be [[better]] --would
you not? 

yes, certainly. 
shall we try to find a [[common]] basis by asking of ourselves what ought
to be the [[chief]] aim of the legislator in making laws [[law]] and in the organization
of a [[state]], --what is the [[greatest]] i [[good]], and what is the greatest
evil, and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp
of the [[good]] or of the [[evil]]? 

by all means. 
can there be any greater [[evil]] than discord and distraction and plurality
where unity ought to reign? or any greater [[good]] than the bond of unity?

there cannot. 
and there is unity where there is [[community]] of pleasures [[pleasure]] and pains
--where all the [[citizens]] are glad or [[grieved]] on the same occasions
of joy and [[sorrow]]? 

no [[doubt]]. 
yes; and where there is no [[common]] but only private feeling a state
is disorganized --when you have one half of the [[world]] triumphing and
the other plunged in [[grief]] at the same events happening to the city
or the [[citizens]]? 

certainly. 
such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use
of the terms 'mine' and 'not mine,' 'his' and 'not his.'

exactly so. 
and is not that the best-ordered [[state]] in which the [[greatest]] number
of persons [[person]] apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to
the same thing? 

quite true. 
or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the
individual --as in the [[body]], when but a finger of one of us is hurt,
the whole frame, drawn towards the [[soul]] as a center and forming one
kingdom under the ruling [[power]] therein, feels [[feel]] the hurt and sympathizes
all together with the part affected, and we say that the [[man]] has a
pain in his finger; and the same expression is used about any other
part of the [[body]], which has a sensation of [[pain]] at suffering or of
pleasure at the alleviation of suffering. 

very true, he replied; and i agree with you that in the best-ordered
state there is the nearest approach to this [[common]] feeling which you
describe. 

then when any one of the [[citizens]] experiences any [[good]] or [[evil]], the
whole [[state]] will make his case their own, and will either rejoice
or [[sorrow]] with him? 

yes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered [[state]].

it will now be [[time]], i said, for us to return to our [[state]] and see
whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental
principles. 

very [[good]]. 
our [[state]] like every other has rulers and subjects [[subject]]? 
true. 
all of whom will call one another [[citizens]]? 
of course. 
but is there not another name which [[people]] give to their rulers in
other states? 

generally they call them masters, but in democratic states they simply
call them rulers. 

and in our [[state]] what other name besides that of [[citizens]] do the people
give the rulers? 

they are called saviours and helpers, he replied. 
and what do the rulers call the [[people]]? 
their maintainers and foster-fathers. 
and what do they call them in other states? 
slaves. 
and what do the rulers call one another in other states?

fellow-rulers. 
and what in ours? 
fellow-guardians. 
did you ever [[know]] an [[example]] in any other [[state]] of a ruler who would
speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not
being his friend? 

yes, very often. 
and the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest,
and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest? 

exactly. 
but would any of your guardians [[think]] or speak of any other guardian
as a stranger? 

certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded
by them either as a [[brother]] or sister, or [[father]] or [[mother]], or son
or [[daughter]], or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected
with him. 

capital, i said; but let me ask you once more: shall they be a family
in name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name?
for [[example]], in the use of the word 'father,' would the [[care]] of a
father be implied and the filial reverence and [[duty]] and obedience
to him which the [[law]] commands; and is the violator of these duties
to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous [[person]] who is not likely
to receive much [[good]] either at the hands of [[god]] or of [[man]]? are these
to be or not to be the strains which the [[children]] will hear repeated
in their ears by all the [[citizens]] about those who are intimated to
them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?

these, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than
for them to utter the names of [[family]] ties with the lips only and
not to act in the spirit of them? 

then in our [[city]] the [[language]] of harmony and concord will be more
often beard than in any other. as i was describing before, when any
one is well or ill, the universal word will be with me it is well'
or 'it is ill.' 

most true. 
and agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying
that they will have their pleasures [[pleasure]] and pains [[pain]] in [[common]]?

yes, and so they will. 
and they will have a [[common]] interest in the same thing which they
will alike call 'my own,' and having this [[common]] interest they will
have a [[common]] feeling of [[pleasure]] and [[pain]]? 

yes, far more so than in other states. 
and the [[reason]] of this, over and above the general [[constitution]] of
the [[state]], will be that the guardians will have a [[community]] of women
and [[children]]? 

that will be the [[chief]] [[reason]]. 
and this unity of feeling we admitted to be the [[greatest]] [[good]], as
was implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered [[state]] to the relation
of the [[body]] and the members, when affected by [[pleasure]] or [[pain]]?

that we acknowledged, and very rightly. 
then the [[community]] of wives [[wife]] and [[children]] among our [[citizens]] is clearly
the source of the [[greatest]] [[good]] to the [[state]]? 

certainly. 
and this agrees with the other [[principle]] which we were affirming,
--that the guardians were not to have houses or lands [[land]] or any other
property; their [[pay]] was to be their food, which they were to receive
from the other [[citizens]], and they were to have no private expenses;
for we intended them to preserve their true [[character]] of guardians.

right, he replied. 
both the [[community]] of [[property]] and the [[community]] of families [[family]], as i
am saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear
the [[city]] in pieces by differing about 'mine' and 'not mine;' each
man dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house
of his own, where he has a separate [[wife]] and [[children]] and private
pleasures and pains [[pain]]; but all will be affected as far as may be by
the same pleasures [[pleasure]] and pains [[pain]] because they are all of one [[opinion]] about
what is near and dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards
a [[common]] end. 

certainly, he replied. 
and as they have nothing but their persons [[person]] which they can call their
own, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they
will be delivered from all those quarrels of which [[money]] or children
or relations are the [[occasion]]. 

of course they will. 
neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur
among them. for that equals [[equal]] should defend themselves against equals
we shall maintain to be honourable and [[right]]; we shall make the protection
of the [[person]] a matter of necessity. 

that is [[good]], he said. 
yes; and there is a further [[good]] in the [[law]]; viz. that if a [[man]] has
a quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there,
and not proceed to more dangerous lengths. 

certainly. 
to the elder shall be assigned the [[duty]] of ruling and chastising the
younger. 

clearly. 
nor can there be a [[doubt]] that the younger will not strike or do any
other [[violence]] to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor
will he slight him in any way. for there are two guardians, shame
and [[fear]], mighty to prevent him: shame, which makes [[men]] refrain from
laying hands on those who are to them in the relation of parents;
fear, that the injured one will be succoured by the others who are
his brothers [[brother]], sons [[son]], one wi fathers [[father]]. 

that is true, he replied. 
then in every way the laws [[law]] will [[help]] the [[citizens]] to keep the peace
with one another? 

yes, there will be no want of [[peace]]. 
and as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will
be no danger of the rest of the [[city]] being divided either against
them or against one another. 

none whatever. 
i hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they
will be rid, for they are beneath notice: such, for [[example]], as the
flattery of the [[rich]] by the [[poor]], and all the pains [[pain]] and pangs which
men [[experience]] in bringing up a [[family]], and in finding [[money]] to buy
necessaries for their household, borrowing and then repudiating, getting
how they can, and giving the [[money]] into the hands of [[women]] and slaves
to keep --the many evils [[evil]] of so many kinds [[kind]] which [[people]] suffer in this
way are mean enough and obvious enough, and not worth speaking of.

yes, he said, a [[man]] has no need of [[eyes]] in order to perceive that.

and from all these evils [[evil]] they will be delivered, and their [[life]] will
be blessed as the [[life]] of olympic victors and yet more blessed.

how so? 
the olympic victor, i said, is deemed [[happy]] in receiving a part only
of the blessedness which is secured to our [[citizens]], who have won
a more glorious [[victory]] and have a more complete maintenance at the
public cost. for the [[victory]] which they have won is the salvation
of the whole [[state]]; and the [[crown]] with which they and their children
are crowned is the fulness of all that [[life]] needs; they receive rewards
from the hands of their [[country]] while living, and after [[death]] have
an honourable burial. 

yes, he said, and glorious rewards [[reward]] they are. 
do you [[remember]], i said, how in the course of the previous discussion
some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians
unhappy --they had nothing and might have possessed all things-to
whom we replied that, if an [[occasion]] offered, we might perhaps hereafter
consider this [[question]], but that, as at [[present]] advised, we would
make our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the
state with a view to the [[greatest]] [[happiness]], not of any particular
class, but of the whole? 

yes, i [[remember]]. 
and what do you say, now that the [[life]] of our protectors is made out
to be far [[better]] and nobler than that of olympic victors --is the
life of shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be
compared with it? 

certainly not. 
at the same [[time]] i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere,
that if any of our guardians shall try to be [[happy]] in such a manner
that he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this
safe and harmonious [[life]], which, in our [[judgment]], is of all lives
the [[best]], but infatuated by some youthful conceit of [[happiness]] which
gets up into his head shall seek to appropriate the whole [[state]] to
himself, then he will have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke, when
he said, 'half is more than the whole.' 

if he were to consult me, i should say to him: stay where you are,
when you have the offer of such a [[life]]. 

you agree then, i said, that [[men]] and [[women]] are to have a [[common]] way
of [[life]] such as we have described --common [[education]], [[common]] [[children]];
and they are to watch over the [[citizens]] in [[common]] whether abiding
in the [[city]] or going out to [[war]]; they are to keep watch together,
and to hunt together like dogs; and always and in all things, as far
as they are able, [[women]] are to share with the [[men]]? and in so doing
they will do what is [[best]], and will not violate, but preserve the
natural relation of the sexes [[sex]]. 

i agree with you, he replied. 
the enquiry, i said, has yet to be made, whether such a community
be found possible --as among other animals, so also among [[men]] --and
if possible, in what way possible? 

you have anticipated the [[question]] which i was about to suggest.

there is no difficulty, i said, in seeing how [[war]] will be carried
on by them. 

how? 
why, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take
with them any of their [[children]] who are [[strong]] enough, that, after
the manner of the artisan's child, they may look on at the [[work]] which
they will have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on
they will have to [[help]] and be of use in [[war]], and to wait upon their
fathers and mothers [[mother]]. did you never observe in the [[arts]] how the potters'
boys look on and [[help]], long before they touch the wheel?

yes, i have. 
and shall potters be more careful in educating their [[children]] and
in giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties
than our guardians will be? 

the [[idea]] is ridiculous, he said. 
there is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with other
animals, the presence of their [[young]] ones will be the [[greatest]] incentive
to valour. 

that is quite true, [[socrates]]; and yet if they are defeated, which
may often happen in [[war]], how [[great]] the danger is! the [[children]] will
be lost as well as their parents, and the [[state]] will never recover.

true, i said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?

i am far from saying that. 
well, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on
some [[occasion]] when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better
for it? 

clearly. 
whether the future soldiers do or do not see [[war]] in the days of their
youth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk
may fairly be incurred. 

yes, very important. 
this then must be our first step, --to make our [[children]] spectators
of [[war]]; but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against
danger; then all will be well. 

true. 
their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of [[war]],
but to [[know]], as far as [[human]] foresight can, what expeditions are safe
and what dangerous? 

that may be assumed. 
and they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about
the dangerous ones? 

true. 
and they will place them under the command of experienced veterans
who will be their leaders and teachers? 

very properly. 
still, the dangers of [[war]] cannot be always foreseen; there is a good
deal of [[chance]] about them? 

true. 
then against such chances [[chance]] the [[children]] must be at once furnished with
wings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.

what do you mean? he said. 
i mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest [[youth]],
and when they have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see [[war]]:
the horses must be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and
yet the swiftest that can be had. in this way they will get an excellent
view of what is hereafter to be their own [[business]]; and if there is
danger they have only to [[follow]] their elder leaders and escape.

i [[believe]] that you are [[right]], he said. 
next, as to [[war]]; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to
one another and to their enemies [[enemy]]? i should be inclined to propose
that the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is
guilty of any other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the
rank of a husbandman or artisan. what do you [[think]]? 

by all means, i should say. 
and he who allows himself to be taken [[prisoner]] may as well be made
a [[present]] of to his enemies [[enemy]]; he is their lawful prey, and let them
do what they like with him. 

certainly. 
but the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to
him? in the first place, he shall receive [[honour]] in the [[army]] from
his youthful comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown
him. what do you say? 

i approve. 
and what do you say to his receiving the [[right]] hand of fellowship?

to that too, i agree. 
but you will hardly agree to my next proposal. 
what is your proposal? 
that he should kiss and be kissed by them. 
most certainly, and i should be disposed to go further, and say: let
no one whom he has a [[mind]] to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while
the expedition lasts. so that if there be a lover in the [[army]], whether
his [[love]] be [[youth]] or maiden, he may be more eager to [[win]] the prize
of valour. 

capital, i said. that the brave [[man]] is to have more wives [[wife]] than others
has been already determined: and he is to have first choices in such
matters more than others, in order that he may have as many children
as possible? 

agreed. 
again, there is another manner in which, according to [[homer]], brave
youths should be honoured; for he tells how ajax, after he had distinguished
himself in [[battle]], was rewarded with long chines, which seems to be
a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his [[age]], being
not only a tribute of [[honour]] but also a very strengthening thing.

most true, he said. 
then in this, i said, [[homer]] shall be our teacher; and we too, at sacrifices
and on the like occasions [[occasion]], will [[honour]] the brave according to the
measure of their valour, whether [[men]] or [[women]], with hymns and those
other distinctions which we were mentioning; also with 

seats of precedence, and meats and full cups; and in honouring them,
we shall be at the same [[time]] training them. 

that, he replied, is excellent. 
yes, i said; and when a [[man]] dies gloriously in [[war]] shall we not say,
in the first place, that he is of the golden [[race]]? 

to be sure. 
nay, have we not the [[authority]] of hesiod for affirming that when they
are [[dead]] 

they are holy angels upon the [[earth]], authors of [[good]], averters of
evil, the guardians of speech-gifted [[men]]? 

yes; and we accept his [[authority]]. 
we must learn of the [[god]] how we are to order the sepulture of divine
and heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction
and we must do as he bids? 

by all means. 
and in ages [[age]] to come we will reverence them and knee. before their
sepulchres as at the graves of heroes. and not only they but any who
are deemed pre-eminently [[good]], whether they [[die]] from [[age]], or in any
other way, shall be admitted to the same honours [[honour]]. 

that is very [[right]], he said. 
next, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies [[enemy]]? what about this?

in what [[respect]] do you mean? 
first of all, in regard to [[slavery]]? do you [[think]] it [[right]] that hellenes
should enslave hellenic states, or allow others to enslave them, if
they can [[help]]? should not their custom be to spare them, considering
the danger which there is that the whole [[race]] may one day fall under
the yoke of the barbarians? 

to spare them is infinitely [[better]]. 
then no hellene should be owned by them as a [[slave]]; that is a rule
which they will observe and advise the other hellenes to observe.

certainly, he said; they will in this way be [[united]] against the barbarians
and will keep their hands off one another. 

next as to the slain; ought the conquerors, i said, to take anything
but their armour? does not the practice of despoiling an [[enemy]] afford
an excuse for not facing the [[battle]]? cowards skulk about the [[dead]],
pretending that they are fulfilling a [[duty]], and many an [[army]] before
now has been lost from this [[love]] of plunder. 

very true. 
and is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and
also a [[degree]] of meanness and womanishness in making an [[enemy]] of the
dead [[body]] when the real [[enemy]] has flown away and left only his fighting
gear behind him, --is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at
his assailant, quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead?

very like a dog, he said. 
then we must abstain from spoiling the [[dead]] or hindering their burial?

yes, he replied, we most certainly must. 
neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of
all the arms of hellenes, if we [[care]] to maintain [[good]] feeling with
other hellenes; and, indeed, we have [[reason]] to [[fear]] that the offering
of spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by
the [[god]] himself? 

very true. 
again, as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning
of houses, what is to be the practice? 

may i have the [[pleasure]], he said, of hearing your [[opinion]]?

both should be forbidden, in my [[judgment]]; i would take the annual
produce and no more. shall i tell you why? 

pray do. 
why, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 'war,'
and i imagine that there is also a difference in their natures [[nature]]; the
one is expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what
is external and [[foreign]]; and the first of the two is termed discord,
and only the second, [[war]]. 

that is a very proper distinction, he replied. 
and may i not observe with [[equal]] propriety that the hellenic race
is all [[united]] together by ties of [[blood]] and [[friendship]], and alien
and [[strange]] to the barbarians? 

very [[good]], he said. 
and therefore when hellenes [[fight]] with barbarians and barbarians with
hellenes, they will be described by us as being at [[war]] when they [[fight]],
and by [[nature]] enemies [[enemy]], and this [[kind]] of antagonism should be called
war; but when hellenes [[fight]] with one another we shall say that hellas
is then in a [[state]] of disorder and discord, they being by [[nature]] friends
and such enmity is to be called discord. 

i agree. 
consider then, i said, when that which we have acknowledged to be
discord occurs, and a [[city]] is divided, if both parties [[destroy]] the
lands and burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife
appear! no true lover of his [[country]] would bring himself to tear in
pieces his own nurse and [[mother]]: there might be [[reason]] in the conqueror
depriving the conquered of their harvest, but still they would have
the [[idea]] of [[peace]] in their hearts [[heart]] and would not mean to go on fighting
for ever. 

yes, he said, that is a [[better]] temper than the other. 
and will not the [[city]], which you are founding, be an hellenic [[city]]?

it ought to be, he replied. 
then will not the [[citizens]] be [[good]] and civilized? 
yes, very civilized. 
and will they not be lovers of hellas, and [[think]] of hellas as their
own [[land]], and share in the [[common]] temples? 

most certainly. 
and any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them
as discord only --a quarrel among [[friends]], which is not to be called
a [[war]]? 

certainly not. 
then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?
certainly. 

they will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy
their opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies [[enemy]]? 

just so. 
and as they are hellenes themselves they will not devastate hellas,
nor will they burn houses, not even suppose that the whole population
of a [[city]] --men, [[women]], and [[children]] --are equally their enemies [[enemy]],
for they [[know]] that the guilt of [[war]] is always confined to a few persons
and that the many are their [[friends]]. and for all these reasons [[reason]] they
will be unwilling to waste their lands [[land]] and raze their houses; their
enmity to them will only [[last]] until the many [[innocent]] sufferers have
compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction? 

i agree, he said, that our [[citizens]] should thus deal with their hellenic
enemies; and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one another.

then let us enact this [[law]] also for our guardians:-that they are neither
to devastate the lands [[land]] of hellenes nor to burn their houses.

agreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, all our previous
enactments, are very [[good]]. 

but still i must say, [[socrates]], that if you are allowed to go on in
this way you will entirely forget the other [[question]] which at the
commencement of this discussion you thrust aside: --is such an order
of things possible, and how, if at all? for i am quite ready to acknowledge
that the plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts
of [[good]] to the [[state]]. i will add, what you have omitted, that your
citizens will be the bravest of warriors, and will never leave their
ranks, for they will all [[know]] one another, and each will call the
other [[father]], [[brother]], [[son]]; and if you suppose the [[women]] to join their
armies, whether in the same rank or in the rear, either as a terror
to the [[enemy]], or as auxiliaries in case of need, i [[know]] that they
will then be absolutely invincible; and there are many domestic tic
advantages which might also be mentioned and which i also fully acknowledge:
but, as i admit all these advantages and as many more as you please,
if only this [[state]] of yours were to come into existence, we need say
no more about them; assuming then the existence of the [[state]], let
us now turn to the [[question]] of possibility and ways and means --the
rest may be left. 

if i loiter for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me, i said,
and have no [[mercy]]; i have hardly escaped the first and second waves,
and you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the
third, which is the [[greatest]] and heaviest. when you have seen and
heard the third wave, i [[think]] you be more considerate and will acknowledge
that some [[fear]] and hesitation was [[natural]] respecting a proposal so
extraordinary as that which i have now to [[state]] and investigate.

the more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the more determined
are we that you shall tell us how such a [[state]] is possible: speak
out and at once. 

let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the
search after [[justice]] and [[injustice]]. 

true, he replied; but what of that? 
i was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are
to require that the just [[man]] should in nothing fail of absolute [[justice]];
or may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in
him of a higher [[degree]] of [[justice]] than is to be found in other [[men]]?

the approximation will be enough. 
we are enquiring into the [[nature]] of absolute [[justice]] and into the
character of the perfectly just, and into [[injustice]] and the perfectly
unjust, that we might have an ideal. we were to look at these in order
that we might [[judge]] of our own [[happiness]] and unhappiness according
to the standard which they exhibited and the [[degree]] in which we resembled
them, but not with any view of showing that they could [[exist]] in [[fact]].

true, he said. 
would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated
with consummate art [[arts]] an ideal of a perfectly beautiful [[man]], he was
unable to show that any such [[man]] could ever have existed?

he would be none the worse. 
well, and were we not creating an ideal of a [[perfect]] [[state]]?

to be sure. 
and is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the
possibility of a [[city]] being ordered in the manner described?

surely not, he replied. 
that is the [[truth]], i said. but if, at your request, i am to try and
show how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, i must
ask you, having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.

what admissions? 
i want to [[know]] whether ideals are ever fully realised in [[language]]?
does not the word express more than the [[fact]], and must not the actual,
whatever a [[man]] may [[think]], always, in the [[nature]] of things, fall short
of the [[truth]]? what do you say? 

i agree. 
then you must not insist on my proving that the actual [[state]] will
in every [[respect]] coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover
how a [[city]] may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that
we have discovered the possibility which you demand; and will be contented.
i am sure that i should be contented --will not you? 

yes, i will. 
let me next endeavour to show what is that [[fault]] in states which is
the cause of their [[present]] maladministration, and what is the least
change which will enable a [[state]] to pass into the truer form; and
let the [[change]], if possible, be of one thing only, or if not, of two;
at any rate, let the changes [[change]] be as few and slight as possible.

certainly, he replied. 
i [[think]], i said, that there might be a reform of the [[state]] if only
one [[change]] were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a
possible one. 

what is it? he said. 
now then, i said, i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest
of the waves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break
and drown me in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my words.

proceed. 
i said: until [[philosophers]] are kings [[king]], or the kings [[king]] and princes [[prince]] of
this [[world]] have the spirit and [[power]] of [[philosophy]], and political
greatness and [[wisdom]] meet in one, and those commoner natures [[nature]] who pursue
either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside,
cities will never have rest from their evils [[evil]], --nor the [[human]] [[race]],
as i [[believe]], --and then only will this our [[state]] have a possibility
of [[life]] and behold the [[light]] of day. such was the [[thought]], my dear
glaucon, which i would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too
extravagant; for to be convinced that in no other [[state]] can there
be [[happiness]] private or [[public]] is indeed a hard thing. 

socrates, what do you mean? i would have you consider that the word
which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons [[person]], and very
respectable persons [[person]] too, in a figure pulling off their coats all in
a moment, and seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you
might and main, before you [[know]] where you are, intending to do heaven
knows what; and if you don't prepare an [[answer]], and put yourself in
motion, you will be prepared by their fine wits,' and no mistake.

you got me into the scrape, i said. 
and i was quite [[right]]; however, i will do all i can to get you out
of it; but i can only give you good-will and [[good]] [[advice]], and, perhaps,
i may be able to fit answers [[answer]] to your questions [[question]] [[better]] than another
--that is all. and now, having such an auxiliary, you must do your
best to show the unbelievers that you are [[right]]. 

i ought to try, i said, since you offer me such invaluable assistance.
and i [[think]] that, if there is to be a [[chance]] of our escaping, we must
explain to them whom we mean when we say that [[philosophers]] are to
rule in the [[state]]; then we shall be able to defend ourselves: there
will be discovered to be some natures [[nature]] who ought to study philosophy
and to be leaders in the [[state]]; and others who are not born to be
philosophers, and are meant to be followers rather than leaders.

then now for a definition, he said. 
follow me, i said, and i [[hope]] that i may in some way or other be able
to give you a satisfactory explanation. 

proceed. 
i dare say that you [[remember]], and therefore i need not remind you,
that a lover, if [[lie]] is worthy of the name, ought to show his [[love]],
not to some one part of that which he loves [[love]], but to the whole.

i really do not [[understand]], and therefore beg of you to assist my
memory. 

another [[person]], i said, might fairly reply as you do; but a [[man]] of
pleasure like yourself ought to [[know]] that all who are in the flower
of [[youth]] do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover's
breast, and are [[thought]] by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards.
is not this a way which you have with the [[fair]]: one has a snub nose,
and you [[praise]] his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you
say, a [[royal]] look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the
grace of regularity: the dark visage is manly, the [[fair]] are children
of the gods; and as to the sweet 'honey pale,' as they are called,
what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives,
and is not adverse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of [[youth]]?
in a word, there is no excuse which you will not make, and nothing
which you will not say, in order not to lose a [[single]] flower that
blooms in the spring-time of [[youth]]. 

if you make me an [[authority]] in matters of [[love]], for the sake of the
argument, i assent. 

and what do you say of lovers of wine? do you not see them doing the
same? they are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.

very [[good]]. 
and the same is true of ambitious [[men]]; if they cannot command an [[army]],
they are willing to command a file; and if they cannot be honoured
by really [[great]] and important persons [[person]], they are glad to be honoured
by lesser and meaner [[people]], but [[honour]] of some [[kind]] they must have.

exactly. 
once more let me ask: does he who desires [[desire]] any class of goods [[good]], desire
the whole class or a part only? 

the whole. 
and may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a
part of [[wisdom]] only, but of the whole? 

yes, of the whole. 
and he who dislikes learnings, especially in [[youth]], when he has no
power of judging what is [[good]] and what is not, such an one we maintain
not to be a philosopher or a lover of [[knowledge]], just as he who refuses
his food is not hungry, and may be said to have a [[bad]] appetite and
not a [[good]] one? 

very true, he said. 
whereas he who has a taste for every sort of [[knowledge]] and who is
curious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a philosopher?
am i not [[right]]? 

glaucon said: if curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many
a [[strange]] being will have a title to the name. all the lovers of sights
have a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. musical
amateurs, too, are a folk strangely out of place among [[philosophers]],
for they are the [[last]] persons [[person]] in the [[world]] who would come to anything
like a philosophical discussion, if they could [[help]], while they run
about at the dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears
to hear every chorus; whether the performance is in town or country
--that makes no difference --they are there. now are we to maintain
that all these and any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors
of quite minor [[arts]], are [[philosophers]]? 

certainly not, i replied; they are only an imitation. 
he said: who then are the true [[philosophers]]? 
those, i said, who are lovers of the vision of [[truth]]. 
that is also [[good]], he said; but i should like to [[know]] what you mean?

to another, i replied, i might have a difficulty in explaining; but
i am sure that you will admit a proposition which i am about to make.

what is the proposition? 
that since [[beauty]] is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?

certainly. 
and inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one? 
true again. 
and of just and [[unjust]], [[good]] and [[evil]], and of every other class, the
same remark holds: taken singly, each of them one; but from the various
combinations of them with actions and things and with one another,
they are seen in all sorts of lights [[light]] and appear many? very true.

and this is the distinction which i draw between the sight-loving,
art-loving, practical class and those of whom i am speaking, and who
are alone worthy of the name of [[philosophers]]. 

how do you distinguish them? he said. 
the lovers of sounds and sights, i replied, are, as i conceive, fond
of fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products
that are made out of them, but their [[mind]] is incapable of seeing or
loving absolute [[beauty]]. 

true, he replied. 
few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this.

very true. 
and he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute
beauty, or who, if another lead him to a [[knowledge]] of that beauty
is unable to [[follow]] --of such an one i ask, is he awake or in a dream
only? reflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens
dissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?

i should certainly say that such an one was dreaming. 
but take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of absolute
beauty and is able to distinguish the [[idea]] from the objects which
participate in the [[idea]], neither putting the objects in the place
of the [[idea]] nor the [[idea]] in the place of the objects --is he a dreamer,
or is he awake? 

he is wide awake. 
and may we not say that the [[mind]] of the one who knows [[know]] has [[knowledge]],
and that the [[mind]] of the other, who opines only, has opinion

certainly. 
but suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our
statement, can we administer any soothing cordial or [[advice]] to him,
without revealing to him that there is [[sad]] disorder in his wits?

we must certainly offer him some [[good]] [[advice]], he replied.

come, then, and let us [[think]] of something to say to him. shall we
begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any [[knowledge]] which he
may have, and that we are rejoiced at his having it? but we should
like to ask him a [[question]]: does he who has [[knowledge]] [[know]] something
or nothing? (you must [[answer]] for him.) 

i [[answer]] that he knows [[know]] something. 
something that is or is not? 
something that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?

and are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of
view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that
the utterly non-existent is utterly unknown? 

nothing can be more [[certain]]. 
good. but if there be anything which is of such a [[nature]] as to be
and not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being
and the absolute negation of being? 

yes, between them. 
and, as [[knowledge]] corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity
to not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there
has to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance
and [[knowledge]], if there be such? 

certainly. 
do we admit the existence of [[opinion]]? 
undoubtedly. 
as being the same with [[knowledge]], or another faculty? 
another faculty. 
then [[opinion]] and [[knowledge]] have to do with different kinds [[kind]] of matter
corresponding to this difference of faculties? 

yes. 
and [[knowledge]] is relative to being and knows [[know]] being. but before i proceed
further i will make a division. 

what division? 
i will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are
powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. sight
and hearing, for [[example]], i should call faculties. have i clearly
explained the class which i mean? 

yes, i quite [[understand]]. 
then let me tell you my view about them. i do not see them, and therefore
the distinctions of [[fire]], colour, and the like, which enable me to
discern the differences of some things, do not apply to them. in speaking
of a faculty i [[think]] only of its sphere and its result; and that which
has the same sphere and the same result i call the same faculty, but
that which has another sphere and another result i call different.
would that be your way of speaking? 

yes. 
and will you be so very [[good]] as to [[answer]] one more [[question]]? would
you say that [[knowledge]] is a faculty, or in what class would you place
it? 

certainly [[knowledge]] is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.

and is [[opinion]] also a faculty? 
certainly, he said; for [[opinion]] is that with which we are able to
form an [[opinion]]. 

and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that [[knowledge]] is
not the same as [[opinion]]? 

why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that
which is infallible with that which errs? 

an excellent [[answer]], proving, i said, that we are quite conscious
of a distinction between them. 

yes. 
then [[knowledge]] and [[opinion]] having distinct powers [[power]] have also distinct
spheres or subject-matters? 

that is [[certain]]. 
being is the sphere or subject-matter of [[knowledge]], and knowledge
is to [[know]] the [[nature]] of being? 

yes. 
and [[opinion]] is to have an [[opinion]]? 
yes. 
and do we [[know]] what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion
the same as the subject-matter of [[knowledge]]? 

nay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in
faculty implies difference in the sphere or [[subject]] matter, and if,
as we were saying, [[opinion]] and [[knowledge]] are distinct faculties, then
the sphere of [[knowledge]] and of [[opinion]] cannot be the same.

then if being is the subject-matter of [[knowledge]], something else must
be the subject-matter of [[opinion]]? 

yes, something else. 
well then, is not-being the subject-matter of [[opinion]]? or, rather,
how can there be an [[opinion]] at all about not-being? reflect: when
a [[man]] has an [[opinion]], has he not an [[opinion]] about something? can he
have an [[opinion]] which is an [[opinion]] about nothing? 

impossible. 
he who has an [[opinion]] has an [[opinion]] about some one thing?

yes. 
and not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?

true. 
of not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative;
of being, [[knowledge]]? 

true, he said. 
then [[opinion]] is not concerned either with being or with not-being?

not with either. 
and can therefore neither be ignorance nor [[knowledge]]? 
that seems to be true. 
but is [[opinion]] to be sought without and beyond either of them, in
a greater clearness than [[knowledge]], or in a greater darkness than
ignorance? 

in neither. 
then i suppose that [[opinion]] appears to you to be darker than [[knowledge]],
but lighter than ignorance? 

both; and in no small [[degree]]. 
and also to be within and between them? 
yes. 
then you would infer that [[opinion]] is intermediate? 
no [[question]]. 
but were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of
a sort which is and is not at the same [[time]], that sort of thing would
appear also to [[lie]] in the interval between pure being and absolute
not-being; and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge
nor ignorance, but will be found in the interval between them?

true. 
and in that interval there has now been discovered something which
we call [[opinion]]? 

there has. 
then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally
of the [[nature]] of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed
either, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may
truly call the [[subject]] of [[opinion]], and assign each to its proper faculty,
-the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the
faculty of the mean. 

true. 
this being premised, i would ask the gentleman who is of [[opinion]] that
there is no absolute or unchangeable [[idea]] of [[beauty]] --in whose opinion
the beautiful is the manifold --he, i say, your lover of beautiful
sights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and
the just is one, or that anything is one --to him i would appeal,
saying, will you be so very [[kind]], sir, as to tell us whether, of all
these beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly;
or of the just, which will not be found [[unjust]]; or of the holy, which
will not also be unholy? 

no, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found
ugly; and the same is true of the rest. 

and may not the many which are doubles be also halves? --doubles,
that is, of one thing, and halves of another? 

quite true. 
and things [[great]] and small, heavy and [[light]], as they are termed, will
not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?

true; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all
of them. 

and can any one of those many things which are called by particular
names be said to be this rather than not to be this? 

he replied: they are like the punning riddles which are [[asked]] at feasts
or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with
what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat
was sitting. the [[individual]] objects of which i am speaking are also
a riddle, and have a double sense: nor can you fix them in your [[mind]],
either as being or not-being, or both, or neither. 

then what will you do with them? i said. can they have a [[better]] place
than between being and not-being? for they are clearly not in greater
darkness or negation than not-being, or more full of [[light]] and existence
than being. 

that is quite true, he said. 
thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas [[idea]] which the
multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things
are tossing about in some region which is halfway between pure being
and pure not-being? 

we have. 
yes; and we had before agreed that anything of this [[kind]] which we
might find was to be described as matter of [[opinion]], and not as matter
of [[knowledge]]; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained
by the intermediate faculty. 

quite true. 
then those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute
beauty, nor can [[follow]] any guide who points the way thither; who see
the many just, and not absolute [[justice]], and the like, --such persons
may be said to have [[opinion]] but not [[knowledge]]? 

that is [[certain]]. 
but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said
to [[know]], and not to have [[opinion]] only? 

neither can that be denied. 
the one loves [[love]] and embraces the subjects [[subject]] of [[knowledge]], the other those
of [[opinion]]? the latter are the same, as i dare say will [[remember]],
who listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon [[fair]] colours, but would
not tolerate the existence of absolute [[beauty]]. 

yes, i [[remember]]. 
shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers
of [[opinion]] rather than lovers of [[wisdom]], and will they be very angry
with us for thus describing them? 

i shall tell them not to be angry; no [[man]] should be angry at what
is true. 

but those who [[love]] the [[truth]] in each thing are to be called lovers
of [[wisdom]] and not lovers of [[opinion]]. 

assuredly.

book vi

socrates - glaucon 

and thus, glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the true
and the false [[philosophers]] have at length appeared in view.

i do not [[think]], he said, that the way could have been shortened.

i suppose not, i said; and yet i [[believe]] that we might have had a
better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined
to this one [[subject]] and if there were not many other questions [[question]] awaiting
us, which he who desires [[desire]] to see in what [[respect]] the [[life]] of the just
differs from that of the [[unjust]] must consider. 

and what is the next [[question]]? he [[asked]]. 
surely, i said, the one which follows next in order. inasmuch as philosophers
only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and those who
wander in the region of the many and variable are not [[philosophers]],
i must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our
state? 

and how can we rightly [[answer]] that [[question]]? 
whichever of the two are [[best]] able to guard the laws [[law]] and institutions
of our [[state]] --let them be our guardians. 

very [[good]]. 
neither, i said, can there be any [[question]] that the guardian who is
to keep anything should have [[eyes]] rather than no [[eyes]]? 

there can be no [[question]] of that. 
and are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge
of the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls [[soul]] no clear
pattern, and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute
truth and to that original to repair, and having [[perfect]] vision of
the other [[world]] to order the laws [[law]] about [[beauty]], goodness, justice
in this, if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order
of them --are not such persons [[person]], i ask, simply blind? 

truly, he replied, they are much in that condition. 
and shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides
being their equals [[equal]] in [[experience]] and falling short of them in no particular
of [[virtue]], also [[know]] the very [[truth]] of each thing? 

there can be no [[reason]], he said, for rejecting those who have this
greatest of all [[great]] qualities; they must always have the first place
unless they fail in some other [[respect]]. 

suppose then, i said, that we determine how far they can unite this
and the other excellences. 

by all means. 
in the first place, as we began by observing, the [[nature]] of the philosopher
has to be ascertained. we must come to an understanding about him,
and, when we have done so, then, if i am not mistaken, we shall also
acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and that
those in whom they are [[united]], and those only, should be rulers in
the [[state]]. 

what do you mean? 
let us suppose that philosophical minds [[mind]] always [[love]] [[knowledge]] of a
sort which shows them the eternal [[nature]] not varying from generation
and [[corruption]]. 

agreed. 
and further, i said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true
being; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less honourable,
which they are willing to renounce; as we said before of the lover
and the [[man]] of [[ambition]]. 

true. 
and if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another
quality which they should also possess? 

what quality? 
truthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind
falsehood, which is their detestation, and they will [[love]] the [[truth]].

yes, that may be safely affirmed of them. 
'may be,' my friend, i replied, is not the word; say rather 'must
be affirmed:' for he whose [[nature]] is amorous of anything cannot help
loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections.

right, he said. 
and is there anything more akin to [[wisdom]] than [[truth]]? 
how can there be? 
can the same [[nature]] be a lover of [[wisdom]] and a lover of falsehood?

never. 
the true lover of learning then must from his earliest [[youth]], as far
as in him lies [[lie]], [[desire]] all [[truth]]? 

assuredly. 
but then again, as we [[know]] by [[experience]], he whose desires [[desire]] are strong
in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like
a stream which has been drawn off into another channel. 

true. 
he whose desires [[desire]] are drawn towards [[knowledge]] in every form will be
absorbed in the pleasures [[pleasure]] of the [[soul]], and will hardly [[feel]] bodily
pleasure --i mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.

that is most [[certain]]. 
such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for
the motives which make another [[man]] desirous of having and spending,
have no place in his [[character]]. 

very true. 
another criterion of the philosophical [[nature]] has also to be considered.

what is that? 
there should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can more
antagonistic than meanness to a [[soul]] which is ever longing after the
whole of things both [[divine]] and [[human]]. 

most true, he replied. 
then how can he who has magnificence of [[mind]] and is the spectator
of all [[time]] and all existence, [[think]] much of [[human]] [[life]]?

he cannot. 
or can such an one account [[death]] fearful? 
no indeed. 
then the cowardly and mean [[nature]] has no part in true [[philosophy]]?

certainly not. 
or again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous
or mean, or a boaster, or a coward-can he, i say, ever be [[unjust]] or
hard in his dealings? 

impossible. 
then you will soon observe whether a [[man]] is just and gentle, or rude
and unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth
the philosophical [[nature]] from the unphilosophical. 

true. 
there is another point which should be remarked. 
what point? 
whether he has or has not a [[pleasure]] in learning; for no one will
love that which gives him [[pain]], and in which after much toil he makes
little [[progress]]. 

certainly not. 
and again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns,
will he not be an empty vessel? 

that is [[certain]]. 
labouring in [[vain]], he must end in hating himself and his fruitless
occupation? yes. 

then a [[soul]] which forgets cannot be ranked among [[genuine]] philosophic
natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a [[good]] memory?

certainly. 
and once more, the inharmonious and unseemly [[nature]] can only tend
to disproportion? 

undoubtedly. 
and do you consider [[truth]] to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?

to proportion. 
then, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally well-proportioned
and gracious [[mind]], which will move spontaneously towards the true
being of everything. 

certainly. 
well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating,
go together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a [[soul]], which
is to have a full and [[perfect]] participation of being? 

they are absolutely necessary, he replied. 
and must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who
has the gift of a [[good]] memory, and is quick to learn, --noble, gracious,
the friend of [[truth]], [[justice]], [[courage]], temperance, who are his kindred?

the [[god]] of [[jealousy]] himself, he said, could find no [[fault]] with such
a study. 

and to [[men]] like him, i said, when perfected by years and [[education]],
and to these only you will entrust the [[state]]. 

socrates - adeimantus 

here adeimantus interposed and said: to these statements, [[socrates]],
no one can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange
feeling passes over the minds [[mind]] of your hearers: they fancy that they
are [[led]] astray a little at each step in the argument, owing to their
own want of [[skill]] in asking and answering questions [[question]]; these littles
accumulate, and at the end of the discussion they are found to have
sustained a mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to
be turned upside down. and as unskilful players of draughts are at
last shut up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to
move, so they too find themselves shut up at [[last]]; for they have nothing
to say in this new game of which words are the counters; and yet all
the [[time]] they are in the [[right]]. the observation is suggested to me
by what is now occurring. for any one of us might say, that although
in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the argument,
he sees as a [[fact]] that the votaries of [[philosophy]], when they carry
on the study, not only in [[youth]] as a part of [[education]], but as the
pursuit of their maturer years, most of them become [[strange]] monsters,
not to say utter rogues, and that those who may be considered the
best of them are made useless to the [[world]] by the very study which
you extol. 

well, and do you [[think]] that those who say so are [[wrong]]? 
i cannot tell, he replied; but i should like to [[know]] what is your
opinion. 

hear my [[answer]]; i am of [[opinion]] that they are quite [[right]].

then how can you be justified in saying that cities [[city]] will not cease
from [[evil]] until [[philosophers]] [[rule]] in them, when [[philosophers]] are acknowledged
by us to be of no use to them? 

you ask a [[question]], i said, to which a reply can only be given in
a parable. 

yes, [[socrates]]; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not
at all accustomed, i suppose. 

i perceive, i said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me
into such a hopeless discussion; but now hear the parable, and then
you will be still more amused at the meagreness of my [[imagination]]:
for the manner in which the [[best]] [[men]] are treated in their own states
is so grievous that no [[single]] thing on [[earth]] is comparable to it;
and therefore, if i am to plead their cause, i must have recourse
to fiction, and put together a figure made up of many things, like
the fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures.
imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is
taller and stronger than any of the crew, but he is a little deaf
and has a similar infirmity in sight, and his [[knowledge]] of navigation
is not much [[better]]. the sailors are quarrelling with one another about
the steering --every one is of [[opinion]] that he has a [[right]] to steer,
though he has never learned the art [[arts]] of navigation and cannot tell
who taught him or when he learned, and will further assert that it
cannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who
says the contrary. they throng about the captain, begging and praying
him to commit the helm to them; and if at any [[time]] they do not prevail,
but others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them
overboard, and having first chained up the [[noble]] captain's senses
with drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession
of the ship and make [[free]] with the stores; thus, eating and drinking,
they proceed on their [[voyage]] in such a manner as might be expected
of them. him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their
plot for getting the ship out of the captain's hands into their own
whether by [[force]] or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor,
pilot, able seaman, and [[abuse]] the other sort of [[man]], whom they call
a good-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must [[pay]] attention to
the year and seasons and [[sky]] and stars and winds, and whatever else
belongs to his art [[arts]], if he intends to be really qualified for the command
of a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other
people like or not-the possibility of this union of [[authority]] with
the steerer's art [[arts]] has never seriously entered into their thoughts
or been made part of their calling. now in vessels which are in a
state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true
pilot be regarded? will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer,
a good-for-nothing? 

of course, said adeimantus. 
then you will hardly need, i said, to hear the interpretation of the
figure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the
state; for you [[understand]] already. 

certainly. 
then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised
at finding that [[philosophers]] have no [[honour]] in their cities [[city]]; explain
it to him and try to convince him that their having [[honour]] would be
far more extraordinary. 

i will. 
say to him, that, in deeming the [[best]] votaries of [[philosophy]] to be
useless to the rest of the [[world]], he is [[right]]; but also tell him to
attribute their uselessness to the [[fault]] of those who will not use
them, and not to themselves. the pilot should not humbly beg the sailors
to be commanded by him --that is not the order of [[nature]]; neither
are 'the [[wise]] to go to the doors of the rich' --the ingenious author
of this saying told a [[lie]] --but the [[truth]] is, that, when a [[man]] is
ill, whether he be [[rich]] or [[poor]], to the physician he must go, and
he who wants to be governed, to him who is able to govern. the ruler
who is [[good]] for anything ought not to beg his subjects [[subject]] to be ruled
by him; although the [[present]] governors of [[mankind]] are of a different
stamp; they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors, and the
true helmsmen to those who are called by them good-for-nothings and
star-gazers. 

precisely so, he said. 
for these reasons [[reason]], and among [[men]] like these, [[philosophy]], the noblest
pursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the
opposite faction; not that the [[greatest]] and most lasting injury is
done to her by her opponents, but by her own professing followers,
the same of whom you suppose the accuser to say, that the greater
number of them are arrant rogues, and the [[best]] are useless; in which
opinion i agreed. 

yes. 
and the [[reason]] why the [[good]] are useless has now been explained?

true. 
then shall we proceed to show that the [[corruption]] of the majority
is also unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge
of [[philosophy]] any more than the other? 

by all means. 
and let us ask and [[answer]] in turn, first going back to the description
of the gentle and [[noble]] [[nature]]. [[truth]], as you will [[remember]], was his
leader, whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this,
he was an impostor, and had no part or lot in true [[philosophy]].

yes, that was said. 
well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at
variance with [[present]] notions of him? 

certainly, he said. 
and have we not a [[right]] to say in his defence, that the true lover
of [[knowledge]] is always striving after being --that is his [[nature]];
he will not rest in the multiplicity of individuals [[individual]] which is an appearance
only, but will go on --the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the
force of his [[desire]] abate until he have attained the [[knowledge]] of
the true [[nature]] of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power
in the [[soul]], and by that [[power]] drawing near and mingling and becoming
incorporate with very being, having begotten [[mind]] and [[truth]], he will
have [[knowledge]] and will [[live]] and grow truly, and then, and not till
then, will he cease from his travail. 

nothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of him.

and will the [[love]] of a [[lie]] be any part of a philosopher's [[nature]]?
will he not utterly hate a [[lie]]? 

he will. 
and when [[truth]] is the captain, we cannot suspect any [[evil]] of the band
which he leads? 

impossible. 
justice and health of [[mind]] will be of the company, and temperance
will [[follow]] after? 

true, he replied. 
neither is there any [[reason]] why i should again set in array the philosopher's
virtues, as you will doubtless [[remember]] that [[courage]], magnificence,
apprehension, memory, were his [[natural]] gifts. and you objected that,
although no one could deny what i then said, still, if you leave words
and look at facts [[fact]], the persons [[person]] who are thus described are some of
them manifestly useless, and the greater number utterly depraved;
we were then [[led]] to enquire into the grounds of these accusations,
and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the majority [[bad]],
which [[question]] of necessity brought us back to the examination and
definition of the true philosopher. 

exactly. 
and we have next to consider the of the philosophic [[nature]], why so
many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling --i am speaking of those
who were said to be useless but not wicked --and, when we have done
with them, we will speak of the imitators of [[philosophy]], what manner
of [[men]] are they who aspire after a profession which is above them
and of which they are unworthy, and then, by their manifold inconsistencies,
bring upon [[philosophy]], and upon all [[philosophers]], that universal reprobation
of which we speak. 

what are these corruptions? he said. 
i will see if i can explain them to you. every one will admit that
a [[nature]] having in [[perfection]] all the qualities which we required
in a philosopher, is a rare plant which is seldom seen among [[men]].

rare indeed. 
and what numberless and powerful causes tend to [[destroy]] these rare
natures! 

what causes? 
in the first place there are their own virtues [[virtue]], their [[courage]], temperance,
and the rest of them, every one of which [[praise]] worthy qualities (and
this is a most singular circumstance) destroys and distracts from
philosophy the [[soul]] which is the possessor of them. 

that is very singular, he replied. 
then there are all the ordinary goods [[good]] of [[life]] --beauty, [[wealth]], [[strength]],
rank, and [[great]] connections in the [[state]] --you [[understand]] the sort
of things --these also have a corrupting and distracting effect.

i [[understand]]; but i should like to [[know]] more precisely what you mean
about them. 

grasp the [[truth]] as a whole, i said, and in the [[right]] way; you will
then have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and
they will no longer appear [[strange]] to you. 

and how am i to do so? he [[asked]]. 
why, i said, we [[know]] that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or
animal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or [[climate]] or
soil, in proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to
the want of a suitable environment, for [[evil]] is a greater [[enemy]] to
what is [[good]] than what is not. 

very true. 
there is [[reason]] in supposing that the finest natures [[nature]], when under alien
conditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast
is greater. 

certainly. 
and may we not say, adeimantus, that the most gifted minds [[mind]], when they
are ill-educated, become pre-eminently [[bad]]? do not [[great]] crimes and
the spirit of pure [[evil]] spring out of a fulness of [[nature]] ruined by
education rather than from any inferiority, whereas [[weak]] natures [[nature]] are
scarcely capable of any very [[great]] [[good]] or very [[great]] [[evil]]?

there i [[think]] that you are [[right]]. 
and our philosopher follows the same analogy-he is like a plant which,
having proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all [[virtue]],
but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most noxious
of all weeds, unless he be preserved by some [[divine]] [[power]]. do you
really [[think]], as [[people]] so often say, that our [[youth]] are corrupted
by sophists, or that private teachers of the art [[arts]] [[corrupt]] them in any
degree worth speaking of? are not the [[public]] who say these things
the [[greatest]] of all sophists? and do they not educate to perfection
young and old, [[men]] and [[women]] alike, and [[fashion]] them after their own
hearts? 

when is this accomplished? he said. 
when they meet together, and the [[world]] sits down at an assembly, or
in a court of [[law]], or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular
resort, and there is a [[great]] uproar, and they [[praise]] some things which
are being said or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating
both, shouting and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks
and the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the
praise or blame --at such a [[time]] will not a [[young]] man's [[man]] [[heart]], as
they say, leap within him? will any private training enable him to
stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular [[opinion]]? or will
he be carried away by the stream? will he not have the notions of
good and [[evil]] which the [[public]] in general have --he will do as they
do, and as they are, such will he be? 

yes, [[socrates]]; necessity will compel him. 
and yet, i said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not
been mentioned. 

what is that? 
the gentle [[force]] of attainder or confiscation or [[death]] which, as you
are aware, these new sophists and educators who are the [[public]], apply
when their words are powerless. 

indeed they do; and in [[right]] [[good]] earnest. 
now what [[opinion]] of any other sophist, or of any private [[person]], can
be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest? 

none, he replied. 
no, indeed, i said, even to make the attempt is a [[great]] piece of folly;
there neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different
type of [[character]] which has had no other training in [[virtue]] but that
which is supplied by [[public]] [[opinion]] --i speak, my friend, of human
virtue only; what is more than [[human]], as the proverb says, is not
included: for i would not have you ignorant that, in the [[present]] evil
state of governments [[government]], whatever is saved and comes to [[good]] is saved
by the [[power]] of [[god]], as we may truly say. 

i quite assent, he replied. 
then let me crave your assent also to a further observation.

what are you going to say? 
why, that all those mercenary individuals [[individual]], whom the many call sophists
and whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in [[fact]], [[teach]] nothing
but the [[opinion]] of the many, that is to say, the opinions [[opinion]] of their
assemblies; and this is their [[wisdom]]. i might compare them to a man
who should study the tempers and desires [[desire]] of a mighty [[strong]] beast
who is fed by him-he would learn how to approach and handle him, also
at what times [[time]] and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse,
and what is the meaning of his several cries, and by what sounds,
when another utters them, he is soothed or infuriated; and you may
suppose further, that when, by continually attending upon him, he
has become [[perfect]] in all this, he calls his [[knowledge]] [[wisdom]], and
makes of it a [[system]] or art [[arts]], which he proceeds to [[teach]], although
he has no real notion of what he means by the principles [[principle]] or passions
of which he is speaking, but calls this honourable and that dishonourable,
or [[good]] or [[evil]], or just or [[unjust]], all in accordance with the tastes
and tempers of the [[great]] brute. [[good]] he pronounces to be that in which
the beast delights and [[evil]] to be that which he dislikes; and he can
give no other account of them except that the just and [[noble]] are the
necessary, having never himself seen, and having no [[power]] of explaining
to others the [[nature]] of either, or the difference between them, which
is immense. by [[heaven]], would not such an one be a rare educator?

indeed, he would. 
and in what way does he who thinks [[think]] that [[wisdom]] is the discernment
of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting
or [[music]], or, finally, in [[politics]], differ from him whom i have been
describing for when a [[man]] consorts with the many, and exhibits to
them his poem or other [[work]] of art [[arts]] or the service which he has done
the [[state]], making them his judges [[judge]] when he is not obliged, the so-called
necessity of diomede will oblige him to [[produce]] whatever they [[praise]].
and yet the reasons [[reason]] are utterly ludicrous which they give in confirmation
of their own notions about the honourable and [[good]]. did you ever hear
any of them which were not? 

no, nor am i likely to hear. 
you recognise the [[truth]] of what i have been saying? then let me ask
you to consider further whether the [[world]] will ever be induced to
believe in the existence of absolute [[beauty]] rather than of the many
beautiful, or of the absolute in each [[kind]] rather than of the many
in each [[kind]]? 

certainly not. 
then the [[world]] cannot possibly be a philosopher? 
impossible. 
and therefore [[philosophers]] must inevitably fall under the censure
of the [[world]]? 

they must. 
and of individuals [[individual]] who consort with the mob and seek to please them?

that is evident. 
then, do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved
in his calling to the end? and [[remember]] what we were saying of him,
that he was to have quickness and memory and [[courage]] and magnificence
--these were admitted by us to be the true philosopher's gifts.

yes. 
will not such an one from his early [[childhood]] be in all things first
among all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental
ones? 

certainly, he said. 
and his [[friends]] and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he gets
older for their own purposes [[purpose]]? 

no [[question]]. 
falling at his feet, they will make requests to him and do him honour
and flatter him, because they want to get into their hands now, the
power which he will one day possess. 

that often happens, he said. 
and what will a [[man]] such as he be likely to do under such circumstances,
especially if he be a citizen of a [[great]] [[city]], [[rich]] and [[noble]], and
a tall proper [[youth]]? will he not be full of boundless aspirations,
and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of hellenes and of barbarians,
and having got such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate
himself in the fulness of [[vain]] pomp and senseless [[pride]]?

to be sure he will. 
now, when he is in this [[state]] of [[mind]], if some one gently comes to
him and tells him that he is a [[fool]] and must get understanding, which
can only be got by slaving for it, do you [[think]] that, under such adverse
circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen? 

far otherwise. 
and even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural
reasonableness has had his [[eyes]] opened a little and is humbled and
taken captive by [[philosophy]], how will his [[friends]] behave when they
think that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping
to reap from his companionship? will they not do and say anything
to prevent him from yielding to his [[better]] [[nature]] and to render his
teacher powerless, using to this end private intrigues as well as
public prosecutions? 

there can be no [[doubt]] of it. 
and how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?

impossible. 
then were we not [[right]] in saying that even the very qualities which
make a [[man]] a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from
philosophy, no less than riches [[rich]] and their accompaniments and the other
so-called goods [[good]] of [[life]]? 

we were quite [[right]]. 
thus, my excellent friend, is brought about all that ruin and failure
which i have been describing of the natures [[nature]] [[best]] adapted to the best
of all pursuits; they are natures [[nature]] which we maintain to be rare at
any [[time]]; this being the class out of which come the [[men]] who are the
authors of the [[greatest]] [[evil]] to states and individuals [[individual]]; and also of
the [[greatest]] [[good]] when the tide carries them in that direction; but
a small [[man]] never was the doer of any [[great]] thing either to individuals
or to states. 

that is most true, he said. 
and so [[philosophy]] is left desolate, with her [[marriage]] rite incomplete:
for her own have fallen away and forsaken her, and while they are
leading a false and unbecoming [[life]], other unworthy persons [[person]], seeing
that she has no kinsmen to be her protectors, enter in and dishonour
her; and fasten upon her the reproaches which, as you say, her reprovers
utter, who affirm of her votaries that some are [[good]] for nothing,
and that the greater number deserve the severest [[punishment]].

that is certainly what [[people]] say. 
yes; and what else would you expect, i said, when you [[think]] of the
puny creatures who, seeing this [[land]] open to them --a [[land]] well stocked
with [[fair]] names and showy titles --like prisoners [[prisoner]] running out of prison
into a sanctuary, take a leap out of their trades [[trade]] into [[philosophy]];
those who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable
crafts? for, although [[philosophy]] be in this [[evil]] case, still there
remains a [[dignity]] about her which is not to be found in the [[arts]].
and many are thus attracted by her whose natures [[nature]] are imperfect and
whose souls [[soul]] are maimed and disfigured by their meannesses, as their
bodies are by their trades [[trade]] and crafts. is not this unavoidable?

yes. 
are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out
of durance and come into a [[fortune]]; he takes a bath and puts on a
new coat, and is decked out as a bridegroom going to [[marry]] his master's
daughter, who is left [[poor]] and desolate? 

a most exact parallel. 
what will be the issue of such marriages [[marriage]]? will they not be vile and
bastard? 

there can be no [[question]] of it. 
and when persons [[person]] who are unworthy of [[education]] approach philosophy
and make an [[alliance]] with her who is a rank above them what sort of
ideas and opinions [[opinion]] are likely to be generated? will they not be sophisms
captivating to the ear, having nothing in them [[genuine]], or worthy
of or akin to true [[wisdom]]? 

no [[doubt]], he said. 
then, adeimantus, i said, the worthy disciples of [[philosophy]] will
be but a small remnant: perchance some [[noble]] and well-educated [[person]],
detained by [[exile]] in her service, who in the absence of corrupting
influences remains devoted to her; or some lofty [[soul]] born in a mean
city, the [[politics]] of which he contemns and neglects; and there may
be a gifted few who leave the [[arts]], which they justly despise, and
come to her; --or peradventure there are some who are restrained by
our friend theages' bridle; for everything in the [[life]] of theages
conspired to divert him from [[philosophy]]; but ill-health kept him away
from [[politics]]. my own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning,
for rarely, if ever, has such a monitor been given to any other [[man]].
those who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed
a possession [[philosophy]] is, and have also seen enough of the madness
of the multitude; and they [[know]] that no politician is honest, nor
is there any champion of [[justice]] at whose side they may [[fight]] and
be saved. such an one may be compared to a [[man]] who has fallen among
wild beasts --he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows, but
neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures [[nature]], and
therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the [[state]] or to his
friends, and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life
without doing any [[good]] either to himself or others, he holds his [[peace]],
and goes his own way. he is like one who, in the storm of dust and
sleet which the driving wind hurries along, retires under the shelter
of a wall; and seeing the rest of [[mankind]] full of wickedness, he is
content, if only he can [[live]] his own [[life]] and be pure from [[evil]] or
unrighteousness, and depart in [[peace]] and good-will, with bright hopes [[hope]].

yes, he said, and he will have done a [[great]] [[work]] before he departs.

a [[great]] [[work]] --yes; but not the [[greatest]], unless he find a [[state]] suitable
to him; for in a [[state]] which is suitable to him, he will have a larger
growth and be the saviour of his [[country]], as well as of himself.

the causes why [[philosophy]] is in such an [[evil]] name have now been sufficiently
explained: the [[injustice]] of the charges against her has been shown-is
there anything more which you [[wish]] to say? 

nothing more on that [[subject]], he replied; but i should like to know
which of the governments [[government]] now existing is in your [[opinion]] the one adapted
to her. 

not any of them, i said; and that is precisely the accusation which
i bring against them --not one of them is worthy of the philosophic
nature, and hence that [[nature]] is warped and estranged; --as the exotic
seed which is sown in a [[foreign]] [[land]] becomes denaturalized, and is
wont to be overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil, even so
this [[growth]] of [[philosophy]], instead of persisting, degenerates and
receives another [[character]]. but if [[philosophy]] ever finds in the state
that [[perfection]] which she herself is, then will be seen that she is
in [[truth]] [[divine]], and that all other things, whether natures [[nature]] of men
or [[institutions]], are but [[human]]; --and now, i [[know]] that you are going
to ask, what that [[state]] is. 

no, he said; there you are [[wrong]], for i was going to ask another question
--whether it is the [[state]] of which. we are the founders and inventors,
or some other? 

yes, i replied, ours in most respects [[respect]]; but you may [[remember]] my saying
before, that some living [[authority]] would always be required in the
state having the same [[idea]] of the [[constitution]] which guided you when
as legislator you were laying down the laws [[law]]. 

that was said, he replied. 
yes, but not in a satisfactory manner; you frightened us by interposing
objections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long
and difficult; and what still remains is the reverse of easy.

what is there remaining? 
the [[question]] how the study of [[philosophy]] may be so ordered as not
to be the ruin of the [[state]]: all [[great]] attempts are attended with
risk; 'hard is the [[good]],' as [[men]] say. 

still, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will
then be complete. 

i shall not be hindered, i said, by any want of will, but, if at all,
by a want of [[power]]: my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please
to remark in what i am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly
i declare that states should pursue [[philosophy]], not as they do now,
but in a different spirit. 

in what manner? 
at [[present]], i said, the students of [[philosophy]] are quite [[young]]; beginning
when they are hardly [[past]] [[childhood]], they devote only the [[time]] saved
from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even those
of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit, when
they come within sight of the [[great]] difficulty of the [[subject]], i mean
dialectic, take themselves off. in after [[life]] when invited by some
one else, they may, perhaps, go and hear a lecture, and about this
they make much ado, for [[philosophy]] is not considered by them to be
their proper [[business]]: at [[last]], when they grow old, in most cases
they are extinguished more truly than heracleitus' sun, inasmuch as
they never [[light]] up again. 

but what ought to be their course? 
just the opposite. in [[childhood]] and [[youth]] their study, and what philosophy
they learn, should be suited to their tender years: during this period
while they are growing up towards manhood, the [[chief]] and special care
should be given to their bodies [[body]] that they may have them to use in
the service of [[philosophy]]; as [[life]] advances and the [[intellect]] begins
to mature, let them increase the gymnastics of the [[soul]]; but when
the [[strength]] of our [[citizens]] fails and is [[past]] civil and military
duties, then let them range at will and engage in no serious [[labour]],
as we intend them to [[live]] happily here, and to [[crown]] this [[life]] with
a similar [[happiness]] in another. 

how truly in earnest you are, socrates! he said; i am sure of that;
and yet most of your hearers, if i am not mistaken, are likely to
be still more earnest in their opposition to you, and will never be
convinced; thrasymachus least of all. 

do not make a quarrel, i said, between thrasymachus and me, who have
recently become [[friends]], although, indeed, we were never enemies [[enemy]];
for i shall go on striving to the utmost until i either convert him
and other [[men]], or do something which may [[profit]] them against the day
when they [[live]] again, and hold the like discourse in another state
of existence. 

you are speaking of a [[time]] which is not very near. 
rather, i replied, of a [[time]] which is as nothing in comparison with
eternity. nevertheless, i do not wonder that the many refuse to [[believe]];
for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realised;
they have seen only a conventional imitation of [[philosophy]], consisting
of words artificially brought together, not like these of ours having
a [[natural]] unity. but a [[human]] being who in word and [[work]] is perfectly
moulded, as far as he can be, into the proportion and likeness of
virtue --such a [[man]] ruling in a [[city]] which bears the same image, they
have never yet seen, neither one nor many of them --do you [[think]] that
they ever did? 

no indeed. 
no, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard [[free]] and noble
sentiments; such as [[men]] utter when they are earnestly and by every
means in their [[power]] seeking after [[truth]] for the sake of [[knowledge]],
while they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which
the end is [[opinion]] and strife, whether they meet with them in the
courts of [[law]] or in [[society]]. 

they are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.

and this was what we foresaw, and this was the [[reason]] why [[truth]] forced
us to admit, not without [[fear]] and hesitation, that neither cities
nor states nor individuals [[individual]] will ever attain [[perfection]] until the small
class of [[philosophers]] whom we termed useless but not [[corrupt]] are providentially
compelled, whether they will or not, to take [[care]] of the [[state]], and
until a like necessity be laid on the [[state]] to obey them; or until
kings, or if not kings [[king]], the sons [[son]] of kings [[king]] or princes [[prince]], are divinely
inspired ' d with a true [[love]] of true [[philosophy]]. that either or both
of these alternatives are impossible, i see no [[reason]] to affirm: if
they were so, we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and
visionaries. am i not [[right]]? 

quite [[right]]. 
if then, in the countless ages [[age]] of the [[past]], or at the [[present]] hour
in some [[foreign]] clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected
philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior
power to have the charge of the [[state]], we are ready to assert to the
death, that this our [[constitution]] has been, and is --yea, and will
be whenever the muse of [[philosophy]] is queen. there is no impossibility
in all this; that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.

my [[opinion]] agrees with yours, he said. 
but do you mean to say that this is not the [[opinion]] of the multitude?

i should imagine not, he replied. 
o my friend, i said, do not attack the multitude: they will change
their minds [[mind]], if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with
the view of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education,
you show them your [[philosophers]] as they really are and describe as
you were just now doing their [[character]] and profession, and then mankind
will see that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed
--if they view him in this new [[light]], they will surely [[change]] their
notion of him, and [[answer]] in another strain. who can be at enmity
with one who loves [[love]] them, who that is himself gentle and [[free]] from
envy will be [[jealous]] of one in whom there is no [[jealousy]]? nay, let
me [[answer]] for you, that in a few this harsh temper may be found but
not in the majority of [[mankind]]. 

i quite agree with you, he said. 
and do you not also [[think]], as i do, that the harsh feeling which the
many entertain towards [[philosophy]] originates in the pretenders, who
rush in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault
with them, who make persons [[person]] instead of things the theme of their conversation?
and nothing can be more unbecoming in [[philosophers]] than this.

it is most unbecoming. 
for he, adeimantus, whose [[mind]] is fixed upon true being, has surely
no [[time]] to look down upon the affairs of [[earth]], or to be filled with
malice and envy, contending against [[men]]; his eye is ever directed
towards things fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring
nor injured by one another, but all in order moving according to [[reason]];
these he imitates, and to these he will, as far as he can, conform
himself. can a [[man]] [[help]] imitating that with which he holds reverential
converse? 

impossible. 
and the philosopher holding converse with the [[divine]] order, becomes
orderly and [[divine]], as far as the [[nature]] of [[man]] allows; but like every
one else, he will suffer from detraction. 

of course. 
and if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only himself,
but [[human]] [[nature]] generally, whether in states or individuals [[individual]], into
that which he beholds elsewhere, will he, [[think]] you, be an unskilful
artificer of [[justice]], temperance, and every civil [[virtue]]?

anything but unskilful. 
and if the [[world]] perceives that what we are saying about him is the
truth, will they be angry with [[philosophy]]? will they disbelieve us,
when we tell them that no [[state]] can be [[happy]] which is not designed
by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern? 

they will not be angry if they [[understand]], he said. but how will they
draw out the plan of which you are speaking? 

they will begin by taking the [[state]] and the manners of [[men]], from which,
as from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean
surface. this is no easy task. but whether easy or not, herein will
lie the difference between them and every other legislator, --they
will have nothing to do either with [[individual]] or [[state]], and will
inscribe no laws [[law]], until they have either found, or themselves made,
a clean surface. 

they will be very [[right]], he said. 
having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the
constitution? 

no [[doubt]]. 
and when they are filling in the [[work]], as i conceive, they will often
turn their [[eyes]] upwards and downwards: i mean that they will first
look at absolute [[justice]] and [[beauty]] and temperance, and again at the
human copy; and will mingle and temper the various elements of life
into the image of a [[man]]; and thus they will conceive according to
that other image, which, when existing among [[men]], [[homer]] calls the
form and likeness of [[god]]. 

very true, he said. 
and one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, they
have made the ways of [[men]], as far as possible, agreeable to the ways
of [[god]]? 

indeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.

and now, i said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you described
as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions
is such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant
because to his hands we committed the [[state]]; and are they growing
a little calmer at what they have just heard? 

much calmer, if there is any sense in them. 
why, where can they still find any ground for objection? will they
doubt that the philosopher is a lover of [[truth]] and being?

they would not be so unreasonable. 
or that his [[nature]], being such as we have delineated, is akin to the
highest [[good]]? 

neither can they [[doubt]] this. 
but again, will they tell us that such a [[nature]], placed under favourable
circumstances, will not be perfectly [[good]] and [[wise]] if any ever was?
or will they prefer those whom we have rejected? 

surely not. 
then will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers
bear [[rule]], states and individuals [[individual]] will have no rest from [[evil]], nor
will this our imaginary [[state]] ever be realised? 

i [[think]] that they will be less angry. 
shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle,
and that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other
reason, cannot refuse to come to terms? 

by all means, he said. 
then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected. will
any one deny the other point, that there may be sons [[son]] of kings [[king]] or princes
who are by [[nature]] [[philosophers]]? 

surely no [[man]], he said. 
and when they have come into being will any one say that they must
of necessity be destroyed; that they can hardly be saved is not denied
even by us; but that in the whole course of ages [[age]] no [[single]] one of
them can escape --who will venture to affirm this? 

who indeed! 
but, said i, one is enough; let there be one [[man]] who has a [[city]] obedient
to his will, and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about
which the [[world]] is so incredulous. 

yes, one is enough. 
the ruler may impose the laws [[law]] and [[institutions]] which we have been
describing, and the [[citizens]] may possibly be willing to obey them?

certainly. 
and that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle or
impossibility? 

i [[think]] not. 
but we have sufficiently shown, in what has preceded, that all this,
if only possible, is assuredly for the [[best]]. 

we have. 
and now we say not only that our laws [[law]], if they could be enacted, would
be for the [[best]], but also that the enactment of them, though difficult,
is not impossible. 

very [[good]]. 
and so with [[pain]] and toil we have reached the end of one [[subject]],
but more remains to be discussed; --how and by what studies and pursuits
will the saviours of the [[constitution]] be created, and at what ages
are they to apply themselves to their several studies? 

certainly. 
i omitted the troublesome [[business]] of the possession of [[women]], and
the procreation of [[children]], and the appointment of the rulers, because
i knew that the [[perfect]] [[state]] would be eyed with [[jealousy]] and was
difficult of attainment; but that piece of cleverness was not of much
service to me, for i had to discuss them all the same. the [[women]] and
children are now disposed of, but the other [[question]] of the rulers
must be investigated from the very beginning. we were saying, as you
will [[remember]], that they were to be lovers of their [[country]], tried
by the test of pleasures [[pleasure]] and pains [[pain]], and neither in hardships, nor
in dangers, nor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism
--he was to be rejected who failed, but he who always came forth pure,
like gold tried in the refiner's [[fire]], was to be made a ruler, and
to receive honours [[honour]] and rewards [[reward]] in [[life]] and after [[death]]. this was the
sort of thing which was being said, and then the argument turned aside
and veiled her face; not liking to stir the [[question]] which has now
arisen. 

i perfectly [[remember]], he said. 
yes, my friend, i said, and i then shrank from hazarding the bold
word; but now let me dare to say --that the [[perfect]] guardian must
be a philosopher. 

yes, he said, let that be affirmed. 
and do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts
which were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they
are mostly found in shreds and patches. 

what do you mean? he said. 
you are aware, i replied, that quick [[intelligence]], memory, sagacity,
cleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and
that persons [[person]] who possess them and are at the same [[time]] high-spirited
and magnanimous are not so constituted by [[nature]] as to [[live]] orderly
and in a peaceful and settled manner; they are driven any way by their
impulses, and all solid [[principle]] goes out of them. 

very true, he said. 
on the other hand, those steadfast natures [[nature]] which can [[better]] be depended
upon, which in a [[battle]] are impregnable to [[fear]] and immovable, are
equally immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are always
in a torpid [[state]], and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual
toil. 

quite true. 
and yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those
to whom the higher [[education]] is to be imparted, and who are to share
in any office or command. 

certainly, he said. 
and will they be a class which is rarely found? 
yes, indeed. 
then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours [[labour]] and dangers
and pleasures [[pleasure]] which we mentioned before, but there is another kind
of probation which we did not mention --he must be exercised also
in many kinds [[kind]] of [[knowledge]], to see whether the [[soul]] will be able to
endure the highest of all, will faint under them, as in any other
studies and exercises. 

yes, he said, you are quite [[right]] in testing him. but what do you
mean by the highest of all [[knowledge]]? 

you may [[remember]], i said, that we divided the [[soul]] into three parts;
and distinguished the several natures [[nature]] of [[justice]], temperance, [[courage]],
and [[wisdom]]? 

indeed, he said, if i had forgotten, i should not deserve to hear
more. 

and do you [[remember]] the word of caution which preceded the discussion
of them? 

to what do you refer? 
we were saying, if i am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them
in their [[perfect]] [[beauty]] must take a longer and more circuitous way,
at the end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a
popular exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had
preceded. and you replied that such an exposition would be enough
for you, and so the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to
be a very inaccurate manner; whether you were satisfied or not, it
is for you to say. 

yes, he said, i [[thought]] and the others [[thought]] that you gave us a
fair measure of [[truth]]. 

but, my friend, i said, a measure of such things which in any degree
falls short of the whole [[truth]] is not [[fair]] measure; for nothing imperfect
is the measure of anything, although persons [[person]] are too apt to be contented
and [[think]] that they need search no further. 

not an uncommon case when [[people]] are indolent. 
yes, i said; and there cannot be any worse [[fault]] in a guardian of
the [[state]] and of the laws [[law]]. 

true. 
the guardian then, i said, must be required to take the longer circuit,
and toll at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach
the highest [[knowledge]] of all which, as we were just now saying, is
his proper calling. 

what, he said, is there a [[knowledge]] still higher than this --higher
than [[justice]] and the other virtues [[virtue]]? 

yes, i said, there is. and of the virtues [[virtue]] too we must behold not the
outline merely, as at [[present]] --nothing short of the most finished
picture should satisfy us. when little things are elaborated with
an infinity of pains [[pain]], in order that they may appear in their full
beauty and utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think
the highest truths [[truth]] worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!

a [[right]] [[noble]] [[thought]]; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from
asking you what is this highest [[knowledge]]? 

nay, i said, ask if you will; but i am [[certain]] that you have heard
the [[answer]] many times [[time]], and now you either do not [[understand]] me or,
as i rather [[think]], you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have
of been told that the [[idea]] of [[good]] is the highest [[knowledge]], and that
all other things become useful and advantageous only by their use
of this. you can hardly be ignorant that of this i was about to speak,
concerning which, as you have often heard me say, we [[know]] so little;
and, without which, any other [[knowledge]] or possession of any kind
will [[profit]] us nothing. do you [[think]] that the possession of all other
things is of any value if we do not possess the [[good]]? or the knowledge
of all other things if we have no [[knowledge]] of [[beauty]] and goodness?

assuredly not. 
you are further aware that most [[people]] affirm [[pleasure]] to be the [[good]],
but the finer sort of wits say it is [[knowledge]] 

yes. 
and you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean
by [[knowledge]], but are obliged after all to say [[knowledge]] of the [[good]]?

how ridiculous! 
yes, i said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance
of the [[good]], and then presume our [[knowledge]] of it --for the [[good]] they
define to be [[knowledge]] of the [[good]], just as if we understood them
when they use the term 'good' --this is of course ridiculous.

most true, he said. 
and those who make [[pleasure]] their [[good]] are in [[equal]] perplexity; for
they are compelled to admit that there are [[bad]] pleasures [[pleasure]] as well as
good. 

certainly. 
and therefore to acknowledge that [[bad]] and [[good]] are the same?

true. 
there can be no [[doubt]] about the numerous difficulties in which this
question is involved. 

there can be none. 
further, do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to
seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no
one is satisfied with the appearance of [[good]] --the reality is what
they seek; in the case of the [[good]], appearance is despised by every
one. 

very true, he said. 
of this then, which every [[soul]] of [[man]] pursues and makes the end of
all his actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end,
and yet hesitating because neither knowing the [[nature]] nor having the
same assurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever
good there is in other things, --of a [[principle]] such and so great
as this ought the [[best]] [[men]] in our [[state]], to whom everything is entrusted,
to be in the darkness of ignorance? 

certainly not, he said. 
i am sure, i said, that he who does not [[know]] now the beautiful and
the just are likewise [[good]] will be but a [[sorry]] guardian of them; and
i suspect that no one who is ignorant of the [[good]] will have a true
knowledge of them. 

that, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours. 
and if we only have a guardian who has this [[knowledge]] our [[state]] will
be perfectly ordered? 

of course, he replied; but i [[wish]] that you would tell me whether you
conceive this supreme [[principle]] of the [[good]] to be [[knowledge]] or [[pleasure]],
or different from either. 

aye, i said, i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you
would not be contented with the thoughts [[thought]] of other [[people]] about these
matters. 

true, [[socrates]]; but i must say that one who like you has passed a
lifetime in the study of [[philosophy]] should not be always repeating
the opinions [[opinion]] of others, and never telling his own. 

well, but has any one a [[right]] to say positively what he does not [[know]]?

not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no
right to do that: but he may say what he thinks [[think]], as a matter of [[opinion]].

and do you not [[know]], i said, that all mere opinions [[opinion]] are [[bad]], and the
best of them blind? you would not deny that those who have any true
notion without [[intelligence]] are only like blind [[men]] who [[feel]] their
way along the road? 

very true. 
and do you [[wish]] to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when
others will tell you of brightness and [[beauty]]? 

glaucon - [[socrates]] 

still, i must implore you, [[socrates]], said glaucon, not to turn away
just as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation
of the [[good]] as you have already given of [[justice]] and temperance and
the other virtues [[virtue]], we shall be satisfied. 

yes, my friend, and i shall be at least equally satisfied, but i cannot
help fearing that i shall fall, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring
ridicule upon me. no, sweet sirs, let us not at [[present]] ask what is
the actual [[nature]] of the [[good]], for to reach what is now in my thoughts
would be an effort too [[great]] for me. but of the child of the good
who is likest him, i would fain speak, if i could be sure that you
wished to hear --otherwise, not. 

by all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain
in our debt for the account of the parent. 

i do indeed [[wish]], i replied, that i could [[pay]], and you receive, the
account of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,
however, this latter by way of interest, and at the same [[time]] have
a [[care]] that i do not render a false account, although i have no intention
of deceiving you. 

yes, we will take all the [[care]] that we can: proceed. 
yes, i said, but i must first come to an understanding with you, and
remind you of what i have mentioned in the course of this discussion,
and at many other times [[time]]. 

what? 
the old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many [[good]], and
so of other things which we describe and define; to all of them 'many'
is applied. 

true, he said. 
and there is an absolute [[beauty]] and an absolute [[good]], and of other
things to which the term 'many' is applied there is an absolute; for
they may be brought under a [[single]] [[idea]], which is called the essence
of each. 

very true. 
the many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas [[idea]] are known
but not seen. 

exactly. 
and what is the organ with which we see the visible things?

the sight, he said. 
and with the hearing, i said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive
the other objects of sense? 

true. 
but have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex
piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?

no, i never have, he said. 
then reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional
nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to
be heard? 

nothing of the sort. 
no, indeed, i replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the
other senses --you would not say that any of them requires such an
addition? 

certainly not. 
but you see that without the addition of some other [[nature]] there is
no seeing or being seen? 

how do you mean? 
sight being, as i conceive, in the [[eyes]], and he who has [[eyes]] wanting
to see; colour being also [[present]] in them, still unless there be a
third [[nature]] specially adapted to the [[purpose]], the owner of the eyes
will see nothing and the colours will be invisible. 

of what [[nature]] are you speaking? 
of that which you term [[light]], i replied. 
true, he said. 
noble, then, is the bond which links together sight and visibility,
and [[great]] beyond other bonds by no small difference of [[nature]]; for
light is their bond, and [[light]] is no ignoble thing? 

nay, he said, the reverse of ignoble. 
and which, i said, of the gods in [[heaven]] would you say was the lord
of this element? whose is that [[light]] which makes the eye to see perfectly
and the visible to appear? 

you mean the sun, as you and all [[mankind]] say. 
may not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows?

how? 
neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?

no. 
yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun?

by far the most like. 
and the [[power]] which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which
is dispensed from the sun? 

exactly. 
then the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised
by sight. 

true, he said. 
and this is he whom i call the child of the [[good]], whom the [[good]] begat
in his own likeness, to be in the visible [[world]], in relation to sight
and the things of sight, what the [[good]] is in the intellectual world
in relation to [[mind]] and the things of [[mind]]. 

will you be a little more explicit? he said. 
why, you [[know]], i said, that the [[eyes]], when a [[person]] directs them towards
objects on which the [[light]] of day is no longer shining, but the moon
and stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have
no clearness of vision in them? 

very true. 
but when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines,
they see clearly and there is sight in them? 

certainly. 
and the [[soul]] is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth
and being shine, the [[soul]] perceives and understands and is radiant
with [[intelligence]]; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming
and perishing, then she has [[opinion]] only, and goes blinking about,
and is first of one [[opinion]] and then of another, and seems to have
no [[intelligence]]? 

just so. 
now, that which imparts [[truth]] to the known and the [[power]] of knowing
to the knower is what i would have you term the [[idea]] of [[good]], and
this you will deem to be the cause of [[science]], and of [[truth]] in so
far as the latter becomes the [[subject]] of [[knowledge]]; beautiful too,
as are both [[truth]] and [[knowledge]], you will be [[right]] in esteeming this
other [[nature]] as more beautiful than either; and, as in the previous
instance, [[light]] and sight may be truly said to be like the sun, and
yet not to be the sun, so in this other sphere, [[science]] and truth
may be deemed to be like the [[good]], but not the [[good]]; the [[good]] has
a place of [[honour]] yet higher. 

what a wonder of [[beauty]] that must be, he said, which is the author
of [[science]] and [[truth]], and yet surpasses them in [[beauty]]; for you surely
cannot mean to say that [[pleasure]] is the [[good]]? 

god forbid, i replied; but may i ask you to consider the image in
another point of view? 

in what point of view? 
you would say, would you not, that the sun is only the author of visibility
in all visible things, but of [[generation]] and nourishment and [[growth]],
though he himself is not [[generation]]? 

certainly. 
in like manner the [[good]] may be said to be not only the author of knowledge
to all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet the good
is not essence, but far exceeds essence in [[dignity]] and [[power]].

glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: by the [[light]] of [[heaven]],
how amazing! 

yes, i said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you
made me utter my fancies. 

and [[pray]] continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there
is anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun.

yes, i said, there is a [[great]] deal more. 
then omit nothing, however slight. 
i will do my [[best]], i said; but i should [[think]] that a [[great]] deal will
have to be omitted. 

you have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling powers [[power]], and that
one of them is set over the intellectual [[world]], the other over the
visible. i do not say [[heaven]], lest you should fancy that i am playing
upon the name ('ourhanoz, orhatoz'). may i suppose that you have this
distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your [[mind]]?

i have. 
now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide
each of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main
divisions to [[answer]], one to the visible and the other to the intelligible,
and then compare the subdivisions in [[respect]] of their clearness and
want of clearness, and you will find that the first section in the
sphere of the visible consists of images. and by images i mean, in
the first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections in
water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies [[body]] and the like: do you
understand? 

yes, i [[understand]]. 
imagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance,
to include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or
is made. 

very [[good]]. 
would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different
degrees of [[truth]], and that the copy is to the original as the sphere
of [[opinion]] is to the sphere of [[knowledge]]? 

most undoubtedly. 
next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual
is to be divided. 

in what manner? 
thus: --there are two subdivisions, in the lower or which the soul
uses the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry
can only be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle
descends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the [[soul]] passes
out of hypotheses, and goes up to a [[principle]] which is above hypotheses,
making no use of images as in the former case, but proceeding only
in and through the ideas [[idea]] themselves. 

i do not quite [[understand]] your meaning, he said. 
then i will try again; you will [[understand]] me [[better]] when i have made
some preliminary remarks. you are aware that students of geometry,
arithmetic, and the kindred sciences [[science]] assume the odd and the even and
the figures and three kinds [[kind]] of angles and the like in their several
branches of [[science]]; these are their hypotheses, which they and everybody
are supposed to [[know]], and therefore they do not deign to give any
account of them either to themselves or others; but they begin with
them, and go on until they arrive at [[last]], and in a consistent manner,
at their conclusion? 

yes, he said, i [[know]]. 
and do you not [[know]] also that although they make use of the visible
forms and [[reason]] about them, they are thinking not of these, but of
the ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw,
but of the absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on --the
forms which they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections
in water of their own, are converted by them into images, but they
are really seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only
be seen with the eye of the [[mind]]? 

that is true. 
and of this [[kind]] i spoke as the intelligible, although in the search
after it the [[soul]] is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to
a first [[principle]], because she is unable to rise above the region
of hypothesis, but employing the objects of which the shadows below
are resemblances in their turn as images, they having in relation
to the shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness, and
therefore a higher value. 

i [[understand]], he said, that you are speaking of the province of geometry
and the sister [[arts]]. 

and when i speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will
understand me to speak of that other sort of [[knowledge]] which reason
herself attains by the [[power]] of dialectic, using the hypotheses not
as first principles [[principle]], but only as hypotheses --that is to say, as steps
and points of departure into a [[world]] which is above hypotheses, in
order that she may soar beyond them to the first [[principle]] of the
whole; and clinging to this and then to that which depends on this,
by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible
object, from ideas [[idea]], through ideas [[idea]], and in ideas [[idea]] she ends.

i [[understand]] you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to
be describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate,
i [[understand]] you to say that [[knowledge]] and being, which the science
of dialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the [[arts]],
as they are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are
also contemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet,
because they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a [[principle]],
those who contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher
reason upon them, although when a first [[principle]] is added to them
they are cognizable by the higher [[reason]]. and the habit which is concerned
with geometry and the cognate sciences [[science]] i suppose that you would term
understanding and not [[reason]], as being intermediate between opinion
and [[reason]]. 

you have quite conceived my meaning, i said; and now, corresponding
to these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul-reason
answering to the highest, understanding to the second, [[faith]] (or conviction)
to the third, and perception of shadows to the last-and let there
be a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties
have clearness in the same [[degree]] that their objects have [[truth]].

i [[understand]], he replied, and give my assent, and accept your arrangement.

book vii

socrates - glaucon 

and now, i said, let me show in a figure how far our [[nature]] is enlightened
or unenlightened: --behold! [[human]] beings living in a underground den,
which has a mouth open towards the [[light]] and reaching all along the
den; here they have been from their [[childhood]], and have their legs
and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before
them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads.
above and behind them a [[fire]] is blazing at a distance, and between
the [[fire]] and the prisoners [[prisoner]] there is a raised way; and you will see,
if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which
marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the
puppets. 

i see. 
and do you see, i said, [[men]] passing along the wall carrying all sorts
of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone
and various materials, which appear over the wall? some of them are
talking, others silent. 

you have shown me a [[strange]] image, and they are [[strange]] prisoners [[prisoner]].

like ourselves, i replied; and they see only their own shadows, or
the shadows of one another, which the [[fire]] throws on the opposite
wall of the cave? 

true, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they
were never allowed to move their heads? 

and of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would
only see the shadows? 

yes, he said. 
and if they were able to converse with one another, would they not
suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?

very true. 
and suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the
other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by
spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?

no [[question]], he replied. 
to them, i said, the [[truth]] would be literally nothing but the shadows
of the images. 

that is [[certain]]. 
and now look again, and see what will naturally [[follow]] it' the prisoners
are released and disabused of their error. at first, when any of them
is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck
round and walk and look towards the [[light]], he will suffer sharp pains [[pain]];
the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities
of which in his former [[state]] he had seen the shadows; and then conceive
some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but
that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned
towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision, -what will be
his reply? and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing
to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them, -will
he not be perplexed? will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly
saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?

far truer. 
and if he is compelled to look straight at the [[light]], will he not
have a [[pain]] in his [[eyes]] which will make him turn away to take and
take in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will
conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being
shown to him? 

true, he now 
and suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and
rugged ascent, and held fast until he 's forced into the presence
of the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? when
he approaches the [[light]] his [[eyes]] will be dazzled, and he will not
be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities.

not all in a moment, he said. 
he will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper [[world]].
and first he will see the shadows [[best]], next the reflections of men
and other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then
he will gaze upon the [[light]] of the moon and the stars and the spangled
heaven; and he will see the [[sky]] and the stars by night [[better]] than
the sun or the [[light]] of the sun by day? 

certainly. 
last of he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of
him in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and
not in another; and he will contemplate him as he is. 

certainly. 
he will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season
and the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible [[world]],
and in a [[certain]] way the cause of all things which he and his fellows
have been accustomed to behold? 

clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then [[reason]] about
him. 

and when he remembered his old habitation, and the [[wisdom]] of the den
and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate
himself on the [[change]], and [[pity]] them? 

certainly, he would. 
and if they were in the habit of conferring honours [[honour]] among themselves
on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark
which of them went before, and which followed after, and which were
together; and who were therefore [[best]] able to draw conclusions as
to the future, do you [[think]] that he would [[care]] for such honours [[honour]] and
glories, or envy the possessors of them? would he not say with [[homer]],

better to be the [[poor]] servant of a [[poor]] master, and to endure anything,
rather than [[think]] as they do and [[live]] after their manner?

yes, he said, i [[think]] that he would rather suffer anything than entertain
these false notions and [[live]] in this miserable manner. 

imagine once more, i said, such an one coming suddenly out of the
sun to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be [[certain]] to
have his [[eyes]] full of darkness? 

to be sure, he said. 
and if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the
shadows with the prisoners [[prisoner]] who had never moved out of the den, while
his sight was still [[weak]], and before his [[eyes]] had become steady (and
the [[time]] which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight
might be very considerable) would he not be ridiculous? [[men]] would
say of him that up he went and down he came without his [[eyes]]; and
that it was [[better]] not even to [[think]] of ascending; and if any one
tried to loose another and lead him up to the [[light]], let them only
catch the offender, and they would put him to [[death]]. 

no [[question]], he said. 
this entire allegory, i said, you may now append, dear glaucon, to
the previous argument; the prison-house is the [[world]] of sight, the
light of the [[fire]] is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if
you interpret the [[journey]] upwards to be the ascent of the [[soul]] into
the intellectual [[world]] according to my [[poor]] [[belief]], which, at your
desire, i have expressed whether rightly or wrongly [[god]] knows [[know]]. but,
whether true or false, my [[opinion]] is that in the [[world]] of knowledge
the [[idea]] of [[good]] appears [[last]] of all, and is seen only with an effort;
and, when seen, is also inferred to be the universal author of all
things beautiful and [[right]], parent of [[light]] and of the [[lord]] of light
in this visible [[world]], and the immediate source of [[reason]] and truth
in the intellectual; and that this is the [[power]] upon which he who
would act rationally, either in [[public]] or private [[life]] must have his
eye fixed. 

i agree, he said, as far as i am able to [[understand]] you.

moreover, i said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this
beatific vision are unwilling to descend to [[human]] affairs; for their
souls are ever hastening into the upper [[world]] where they [[desire]] to
dwell; which [[desire]] of theirs is very [[natural]], if our allegory may
be trusted. 

yes, very [[natural]]. 
and is there anything surprising in one who passes from [[divine]] contemplations
to the [[evil]] [[state]] of [[man]], misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner;
if, while his [[eyes]] are blinking and before he has become accustomed
to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to [[fight]] in courts of
law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of images
of [[justice]], and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who
have never yet seen absolute [[justice]]? 

anything but surprising, he replied. 
any one who has [[common]] sense will [[remember]] that the bewilderments
of the [[eyes]] are of two kinds [[kind]], and arise from two causes, either from
coming out of the [[light]] or from going into the [[light]], which is true
of the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who
remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and
weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that
soul of [[man]] has come out of the brighter [[light]], and is unable to see
because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to
the day is dazzled by excess of [[light]]. and he will count the one happy
in his condition and [[state]] of being, and he will [[pity]] the other; or,
if he have a [[mind]] to laugh at the [[soul]] which comes from below into
the [[light]], there will be more [[reason]] in this than in the laugh which
greets him who returns from above out of the [[light]] into the den.

that, he said, is a very just distinction. 
but then, if i am [[right]], [[certain]] professors of [[education]] must be wrong
when they say that they can put a [[knowledge]] into the [[soul]] which was
not there before, like sight into blind [[eyes]]. 

they undoubtedly say this, he replied. 
whereas, our argument shows that the [[power]] and capacity of learning
exists in the [[soul]] already; and that just as the eye was unable to
turn from darkness to [[light]] without the whole [[body]], so too the instrument
of [[knowledge]] can only by the movement of the whole [[soul]] be turned
from the [[world]] of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees
to endure the sight of being, and of the brightest and [[best]] of being,
or in other words, of the [[good]]. 

very true. 
and must there not be some art [[arts]] which will effect conversion in the
easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight,
for that exists already, but has been turned in the [[wrong]] direction,
and is looking away from the [[truth]]? 

yes, he said, such an art [[arts]] may be presumed. 
and whereas the other so-called virtues [[virtue]] of the [[soul]] seem to be akin
to bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate
they can be implanted later by habit and exercise, the of [[wisdom]] more
than anything else contains a [[divine]] element which always remains,
and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the
other hand, hurtful and useless. did you never observe the narrow
intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue --how eager
he is, how clearly his paltry [[soul]] sees the way to his end; he is
the reverse of blind, but his keen eyesight is forced into the service
of [[evil]], and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness.

very true, he said. 
but what if there had been a circumcision of such natures [[nature]] in the days
of their [[youth]]; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures [[pleasure]],
such as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached
to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision
of their souls [[soul]] upon the things that are below --if, i say, they had
been released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction,
the very same faculty in them would have seen the [[truth]] as keenly
as they see what their [[eyes]] are turned to now. 

very likely. 
yes, i said; and there is another thing which is likely. or rather
a necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated
and uninformed of the [[truth]], nor yet those who never make an end of
their [[education]], will be able ministers of [[state]]; not the former,
because they have no [[single]] aim of [[duty]] which is the [[rule]] of all their
actions, private as well as [[public]]; nor the latter, because they will
not act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already
dwelling apart in the islands of the blest. 

very true, he replied. 
then, i said, the [[business]] of us who are the founders of the state
will be to compel the [[best]] minds [[mind]] to attain that [[knowledge]] which we
have already shown to be the [[greatest]] of all-they must continue to
ascend until they arrive at the [[good]]; but when they have ascended
and seen enough we must not allow them to do as they do now.

what do you mean? 
i mean that they remain in the upper [[world]]: but this must not be allowed;
they must be made to descend again among the prisoners [[prisoner]] in the den,
and partake of their labours [[labour]] and honours [[honour]], whether they are worth having
or not. 

but is not this [[unjust]]? he said; ought we to give them a worse [[life]],
when they might have a [[better]]? 

you have again forgotten, my friend, i said, the intention of the
legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the [[state]] happy
above the rest; the [[happiness]] was to be in the whole [[state]], and he
held the [[citizens]] together by persuasion and necessity, making them
benefactors of the [[state]], and therefore benefactors of one another;
to this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his
instruments in binding up the [[state]]. 

true, he said, i had forgotten. 
observe, glaucon, that there will be no [[injustice]] in compelling our
philosophers to have a [[care]] and providence of others; we shall explain
to them that in other states, [[men]] of their class are not obliged to
share in the toils of [[politics]]: and this is reasonable, for they grow
up at their own sweet will, and the [[government]] would rather not have
them. being self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude
for a [[culture]] which they have never received. but we have brought
you into the [[world]] to be rulers of the hive, kings [[king]] of yourselves and
of the other [[citizens]], and have educated you far [[better]] and more perfectly
than they have been educated, and you are [[better]] able to share in
the double [[duty]]. wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must
go down to the general underground abode, and get the habit of seeing
in the dark. when you have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand
times [[better]] than the inhabitants of the den, and you will [[know]] what
the several images are, and what they represent, because you have
seen the beautiful and just and [[good]] in their [[truth]]. and thus our
state which is also yours will be a reality, and not a [[dream]] only,
and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other states,
in which [[men]] [[fight]] with one another about shadows only and are distracted
in the struggle for [[power]], which in their [[eyes]] is a [[great]] [[good]]. whereas
the [[truth]] is that the [[state]] in which the rulers are most reluctant
to govern is always the [[best]] and most quietly governed, and the state
in which they are most eager, the worst. 

quite true, he replied. 
and will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn
at the toils of [[state]], when they are allowed to spend the greater
part of their [[time]] with one another in the heavenly [[light]]?

impossible, he answered; for they are just [[men]], and the commands which
we impose upon them are just; there can be no [[doubt]] that every one
of them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion
of our [[present]] rulers of [[state]]. 

yes, my friend, i said; and there lies [[lie]] the point. you must contrive
for your future rulers another and a [[better]] [[life]] than that of a ruler,
and then you may have a well-ordered [[state]]; for only in the state
which offers this, will they [[rule]] who are truly [[rich]], not in silver
and gold, but in [[virtue]] and [[wisdom]], which are the true blessings of
life. whereas if they go to the administration of [[public]] affairs,
poor and hungering after the' own private advantage, thinking that
hence they are to snatch the [[chief]] [[good]], order there can never be;
for they will be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic
broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves
and of the whole [[state]]. 

most true, he replied. 
and the only [[life]] which looks down upon the [[life]] of [[political]] ambition
is that of true [[philosophy]]. do you [[know]] of any other? 

indeed, i do not, he said. 
and those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? for, if they
are, there will be rival lovers, and they will [[fight]]. 

no [[question]]. 
who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? surely they
will be the [[men]] who are wisest about affairs of [[state]], and by whom
the [[state]] is [[best]] administered, and who at the same [[time]] have other
honours and another and a [[better]] [[life]] than that of [[politics]]?

they are the [[men]], and i will choose them, he replied. 
and now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced,
and how they are to be brought from darkness to [[light]], --as some are
said to have ascended from the [[world]] below to the gods? 

by all means, he replied. 
the process, i said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but
the turning round of a [[soul]] passing from a day which is little better
than night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below,
which we affirm to be true [[philosophy]]? 

quite so. 
and should we not enquire what sort of [[knowledge]] has the [[power]] of
effecting such a [[change]]? 

certainly. 
what sort of [[knowledge]] is there which would draw the [[soul]] from becoming
to being? and another consideration has just occurred to me: you will
remember that our [[young]] [[men]] are to be warrior athletes 

yes, that was said. 
then this new [[kind]] of [[knowledge]] must have an additional quality?

what quality? 
usefulness in [[war]]. 
yes, if possible. 
there were two parts in our former scheme of [[education]], were there
not? 

just so. 
there was gymnastic which presided over the [[growth]] and decay of the
body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation
and [[corruption]]? 

true. 
then that is not the [[knowledge]] which we are seeking to discover? no.

but what do you say of [[music]], which also entered to a [[certain]] extent
into our former scheme? 

music, he said, as you will [[remember]], was the counterpart of gymnastic,
and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making
them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them [[science]];
and the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements
of rhythm and harmony in them. but in [[music]] there was nothing which
tended to that [[good]] which you are now seeking. 

you are most accurate, i said, in your recollection; in [[music]] there
certainly was nothing of the [[kind]]. but what branch of [[knowledge]] is
there, my dear glaucon, which is of the [[desired]] [[nature]]; since all
the useful [[arts]] were reckoned mean by us? 

undoubtedly; and yet if [[music]] and gymnastic are excluded, and the
arts are also excluded, what remains? 

well, i said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects [[subject]]; and
then we shall have to take something which is not special, but of
universal application. 

what may that be? 
a something which all [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] and intelligences use in [[common]],
and which every one first has to learn among the elements of [[education]].

what is that? 
the little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three --in a word,
number and calculation: --do not all [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] necessarily
partake of them? 

yes. 
then the art [[arts]] of [[war]] partakes of them? 
to the sure. 
then palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves [[agamemnon]] ridiculously
unfit to be a general. did you never remark how he declares that he
had [[invented]] number, and had numbered the ships and set in array the
ranks of the [[army]] at troy; which implies that they had never been
numbered before, and [[agamemnon]] must be supposed literally to have
been incapable of counting his own feet --how could he if he was ignorant
of number? and if that is true, what sort of general must he have
been? 

i should say a very [[strange]] one, if this was as you say.

can we deny that a warrior should have a [[knowledge]] of arithmetic?

certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of
military tactics, or indeed, i should rather say, if he is to be a
man at all. 

i should like to [[know]] whether you have the same notion which i have
of this study? 

what is your notion? 
it appears to me to be a study of the [[kind]] which we are seeking, and
which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly
used; for the true use of it is simply to draw the [[soul]] towards being.

will you explain your meaning? he said. 
i will try, i said; and i [[wish]] you would share the enquiry with me,
and say 'yes' or 'no' when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind
what branches of [[knowledge]] have this attracting [[power]], in order that
we may have clearer proof that arithmetic is, as i suspect, one of
them. 

explain, he said. 
i mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds [[kind]]; some of them
do not invite [[thought]] because the sense is an adequate [[judge]] of them;
while in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that
further enquiry is imperatively demanded. 

you are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses
are imposed upon by distance, and by painting in [[light]] and shade.

no, i said, that is not at all my meaning. 
then what is your meaning? 
when speaking of uninviting objects, i mean those which do not pass
from one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which
do; in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether
at a distance or near, gives no more vivid [[idea]] of anything in particular
than of its opposite. an illustration will make my meaning clearer:
--here are three fingers --a little finger, a second finger, and a
middle finger. 

very [[good]]. 
you may suppose that they are seen quite close: and here comes the
point. 

what is it? 
each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle
or at the extremity, whether [[white]] or black, or thick or thin --it
makes no difference; a finger is a finger all the same. in these cases
a [[man]] is not compelled to ask of [[thought]] the [[question]], what is a finger?
for the sight never intimates to the [[mind]] that a finger is other than
a finger. 

true. 
and therefore, i said, as we might expect, there is nothing here which
invites or excites [[intelligence]]. 

there is not, he said. 
but is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?
can sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the
circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another
at the extremity? and in like manner does the touch adequately perceive
the qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness? and
so of the other senses; do they give [[perfect]] intimations of such matters?
is not their mode of operation on this [[wise]] --the sense which is concerned
with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the
quality of softness, and only intimates to the [[soul]] that the same
thing is [[felt]] to be both hard and soft? 

you are quite [[right]], he said. 
and must not the [[soul]] be perplexed at this intimation which the sense
gives of a hard which is also soft? what, again, is the meaning of
light and heavy, if that which is [[light]] is also heavy, and that which
is heavy, [[light]]? 

yes, he said, these intimations which the [[soul]] receives are very curious
and require to be explained. 

yes, i said, and in these perplexities the [[soul]] naturally summons
to her aid calculation and [[intelligence]], that she may see whether
the several objects announced to her are one or two. 

true. 
and if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and different?

certainly. 
and if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as
in a [[state]] of division, for if there were undivided they could only
be conceived of as one? 

true. 
the eye certainly did see both small and [[great]], but only in a confused
manner; they were not distinguished. 

yes. 
whereas the thinking [[mind]], intending to [[light]] up the [[chaos]], was compelled
to reverse the process, and look at small and [[great]] as separate and
not confused. 

very true. 
was not this the beginning of the enquiry 'what is [[great]]?' and 'what
is small?' 

exactly so. 
and thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible.

most true. 
this was what i meant when i spoke of impressions which invited the
intellect, or the reverse --those which are simultaneous with opposite
impressions, invite [[thought]]; those which are not simultaneous do not.

i [[understand]], he said, and agree with you. 
and to which class do unity and number belong? 
i do not [[know]], he replied. 
think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply
the [[answer]]; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the
sight or by any other sense, then, as we were saying in the case of
the finger, there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when
there is some contradiction always [[present]], and one is the reverse
of one and involves the conception of plurality, then [[thought]] begins
to be aroused within us, and the [[soul]] perplexed and wanting to arrive
at a decision asks 'what is absolute unity?' this is the way in which
the study of the one has a [[power]] of drawing and converting the mind
to the contemplation of true being. 

and surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we
see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?

yes, i said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all
number? 

certainly. 
and all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?

yes. 
and they appear to lead the [[mind]] towards [[truth]]? 
yes, in a very remarkable manner. 
then this is [[knowledge]] of the [[kind]] for which we are seeking, having
a double use, [[military]] and philosophical; for the [[man]] of [[war]] must
learn the art [[arts]] of number or he will not [[know]] how to array his [[troops]],
and the philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of
change and lay hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.

that is true. 
and our guardian is both warrior and philosopher? 
certainly. 
then this is a [[kind]] of [[knowledge]] which legislation may fitly prescribe;
and we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the
principal [[men]] of our [[state]] to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs,
but they must carry on the study until they see the [[nature]] of numbers
with the [[mind]] only; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with
a view to buying or selling, but for the sake of their [[military]] use,
and of the [[soul]] herself; and because this will be the easiest way
for her to pass from becoming to [[truth]] and being. 

that is excellent, he said. 
yes, i said, and now having spoken of it, i must add how charming
the [[science]] is! and in how many ways it conduces to our [[desired]] end,
if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!

how do you mean? 
i mean, as i was saying, that arithmetic has a very [[great]] and elevating
effect, compelling the [[soul]] to [[reason]] about abstract number, and rebelling
against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument.
you [[know]] how steadily the masters of the art [[arts]] repel and ridicule any
one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating,
and if you divide, they multiply, taking [[care]] that one shall continue
one and not become lost in fractions. 

that is very true. 
now, suppose a [[person]] were to say to them: o my [[friends]], what are
these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as
you say, there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is [[equal]],
invariable, indivisible, --what would they [[answer]]? 

they would [[answer]], as i should conceive, that they were speaking of
those numbers which can only be realised in [[thought]]. 

then you see that this [[knowledge]] may be truly called necessary, necessitating
as it clearly does the use of the pure [[intelligence]] in the attainment
of pure [[truth]]? 

yes; that is a marked characteristic of it. 
and have you further observed, that those who have a [[natural]] talent
for calculation are generally quick at every other [[kind]] of [[knowledge]];
and even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training, although
they may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker
than they would otherwise have been. 

very true, he said. 
and indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not
many as difficult. 

you will not. 
and, for all these reasons [[reason]], arithmetic is a [[kind]] of [[knowledge]] in which
the [[best]] natures [[nature]] should be trained, and which must not be given up.

i agree. 
let this then be made one of our subjects [[subject]] of [[education]]. and next,
shall we enquire whether the kindred [[science]] also concerns us?

you mean geometry? 
exactly so. 
clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which
relates to [[war]]; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or
closing or extending the lines of an [[army]], or any other [[military]] manoeuvre,
whether in actual [[battle]] or on a march, it will make all the difference
whether a general is or is not a geometrician. 

yes, i said, but for that [[purpose]] a very little of either geometry
or calculation will be enough; the [[question]] relates rather to the
greater and more advanced part of geometry --whether that tends in
any [[degree]] to make more easy the vision of the [[idea]] of [[good]]; and thither,
as i was saying, all things tend which compel the [[soul]] to turn her
gaze towards that place, where is the full [[perfection]] of being, which
she ought, by all means, to behold. 

true, he said. 
then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming
only, it does not concern us? 

yes, that is what we assert. 
yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not
deny that such a conception of the [[science]] is in flat contradiction
to the ordinary [[language]] of geometricians. 

how so? 
they have in view practice only, and are always speaking? in a narrow
and ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and
the like --they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of
daily [[life]]; whereas [[knowledge]] is the real object of the whole [[science]].

certainly, he said. 
then must not a further admission be made? 
what admission? 
that the [[knowledge]] at which geometry aims is [[knowledge]] of the eternal,
and not of aught perishing and transient. 

that, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true. 
then, my [[noble]] friend, geometry will draw the [[soul]] towards [[truth]],
and create the spirit of [[philosophy]], and raise up that which is now
unhappily allowed to fall down. 

nothing will be more likely to have such an effect. 
then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants
of your [[fair]] [[city]] should by all means learn geometry. moreover the
science has indirect effects, which are not small. 

of what [[kind]]? he said. 
there are the [[military]] advantages of which you spoke, i said; and
in all departments of [[knowledge]], as [[experience]] proves, any one who
has [[studied]] geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one
who has not. 

yes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them.

then shall we propose this as a second branch of [[knowledge]] which our
youth will study? 

let us do so, he replied. 
and suppose we make astronomy the third --what do you say?

i am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons
and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to
the [[farmer]] or sailor. 

i am amused, i said, at your [[fear]] of the [[world]], which makes you guard
against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and i quite
admit the difficulty of believing that in every [[man]] there is an eye
of the [[soul]] which, when by other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these
purified and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand
bodily [[eyes]], for by it alone is [[truth]] seen. now there are two classes
of persons [[person]]: one class of those who will agree with you and will take
your words as a revelation; another class to whom they will be utterly
unmeaning, and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales, for
they see no sort of [[profit]] which is to be obtained from them. and
therefore you had [[better]] decide at once with which of the two you
are proposing to argue. you will very likely say with neither, and
that your [[chief]] aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement;
at the same [[time]] you do not grudge to others any benefit which they
may receive. 

i [[think]] that i should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my
own behalf. 

then take a step backward, for we have gone [[wrong]] in the order of
the sciences [[science]]. 

what was the mistake? he said. 
after plane geometry, i said, we proceeded at once to solids in [[revolution]],
instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the second dimension
the third, which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth,
ought to have followed. 

that is true, [[socrates]]; but so little seems to be known as yet about
these subjects [[subject]]. 

why, yes, i said, and for two reasons [[reason]]: --in the first place, no government
patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of
them, and they are difficult; in the second place, students cannot
learn them unless they have a director. but then a director can hardly
be found, and even if he could, as matters now stand, the students,
who are very conceited, would not attend to him. that, however, would
be otherwise if the whole [[state]] became the director of these studies
and gave [[honour]] to them; then disciples would want to come, and there
would be continuous and earnest search, and discoveries would be made;
since even now, disregarded as they are by the [[world]], and maimed of
their [[fair]] proportions, and although none of their votaries can tell
the use of them, still these studies [[force]] their way by their natural
charm, and very likely, if they had the [[help]] of the [[state]], they would
some day emerge into [[light]]. 

yes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. but i do not clearly
understand the [[change]] in the order. first you began with a geometry
of plane surfaces? 

yes, i said. 
and you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?

yes, and i have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous [[state]] of solid
geometry, which, in [[natural]] order, should have followed, made me pass
over this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.

true, he said. 
then assuming that the [[science]] now omitted would come into existence
if encouraged by the [[state]], let us go on to astronomy, which will
be fourth. 

the [[right]] order, he replied. and now, [[socrates]], as you rebuked the
vulgar manner in which i praised astronomy before, my [[praise]] shall
be given in your own spirit. for every one, as i [[think]], must see that
astronomy compels the [[soul]] to look upwards and leads us from this
world to another. 

every one but myself, i said; to every one else this may be clear,
but not to me. 

and what then would you say? 
i should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy
appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards. 

what do you mean? he [[asked]]. 
you, i replied, have in your [[mind]] a truly sublime conception of our
knowledge of the things above. and i dare say that if a [[person]] were
to throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still
think that his [[mind]] was the percipient, and not his [[eyes]]. and you
are very likely [[right]], and i may be a simpleton: but, in my [[opinion]],
that [[knowledge]] only which is of being and of the unseen can make the
soul look upwards, and whether a [[man]] gapes at the heavens [[heaven]] or blinks
on the ground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, i would
deny that he can learn, for nothing of that sort is matter of [[science]];
his [[soul]] is looking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge
is by water or by [[land]], whether he floats, or only lies [[lie]] on his back.

i acknowledge, he said, the [[justice]] of your rebuke. still, i should
like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more
conducive to that [[knowledge]] of which we are speaking? 

i will tell you, i said: the starry [[heaven]] which we behold is wrought
upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most
perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far
to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which
are relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained
in them, in the true number and in every true figure. now, these are
to be apprehended by [[reason]] and [[intelligence]], but not by sight.

true, he replied. 
the spangled heavens [[heaven]] should be used as a pattern and with a view to
that higher [[knowledge]]; their [[beauty]] is like the [[beauty]] of figures
or pictures excellently wrought by the hand of daedalus, or some other
great artist, which we may [[chance]] to behold; any geometrician who
saw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship,
but he would never [[dream]] of thinking that in them he could find the
true [[equal]] or the true double, or the [[truth]] of any other proportion.

no, he replied, such an [[idea]] would be ridiculous. 
and will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks
at the movements of the stars? will he not [[think]] that [[heaven]] and the
things in [[heaven]] are framed by the creator of them in the most perfect
manner? but he will never imagine that the proportions of night and
day, or of both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the
stars to these and to one another, and any other things that are material
and visible can also be eternal and [[subject]] to no deviation --that
would be absurd; and it is equally absurd to take so much pains [[pain]] in
investigating their exact [[truth]]. 

i quite agree, though i never [[thought]] of this before. 
then, i said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems,
and let the heavens [[heaven]] alone if we would approach the [[subject]] in the
right way and so make the [[natural]] gift of [[reason]] to be of any real
use. 

that, he said, is a [[work]] infinitely beyond our [[present]] astronomers.

yes, i said; and there are many other things which must also have
a similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of
any value. but can you tell me of any other suitable study?

no, he said, not without thinking. 
motion, i said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are
obvious enough even to wits no [[better]] than ours; and there are others,
as i imagine, which may be left to wiser persons [[person]]. 

but where are the two? 
there is a second, i said, which is the counterpart of the one already
named. 

and what may that be? 
the second, i said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the
first is to the [[eyes]]; for i conceive that as the [[eyes]] are designed
to look up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions;
and these are sister sciences [[science]] --as the pythagoreans say, and we, glaucon,
agree with them? 

yes, he replied. 
but this, i said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better
go and learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any
other applications of these sciences [[science]]. at the same [[time]], we must not
lose sight of our own higher object. 

what is that? 
there is a [[perfection]] which all [[knowledge]] ought to reach, and which
our pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as i was
saying that they did in astronomy. for in the [[science]] of harmony,
as you probably [[know]], the same thing happens. the teachers of harmony
compare the sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their
labour, like that of the astronomers, is in [[vain]]. 

yes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as [[good]] as a play to hear them talking
about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears
close alongside of the strings like persons [[person]] catching a sound from
their neighbour's wall --one set of them declaring that they distinguish
an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should
be the unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds
have passed into the same --either party setting their ears before
their understanding. 

you mean, i said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings
and rack them on the pegs of the instrument: might carry on the metaphor
and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives,
and make accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and
forwardness to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore i will
only say that these are not the [[men]], and that i am referring to the
pythagoreans, of whom i was just now proposing to enquire about harmony.
for they too are in error, like the astronomers; they investigate
the numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but they never attain
to problems-that is to say, they never reach the [[natural]] harmonies
of number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not.

that, he said, is a thing of more than mortal [[knowledge]].

a thing, i replied, which i would rather call useful; that is, if
sought after with a view to the beautiful and [[good]]; but if pursued
in any other spirit, useless. very true, he said. 

now, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and
connection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual
affinities, then, i [[think]], but not till then, will the pursuit of
them have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no [[profit]] in
them. 

i suspect so; but you are speaking, [[socrates]], of a vast [[work]].

what do you mean? i said; the prelude or what? do you not [[know]] that
all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to
learn? for you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as
a dialectician? 

assuredly not, he said; i have hardly ever known a mathematician who
was capable of reasoning. 

but do you imagine that [[men]] who are unable to give and take a reason
will have the [[knowledge]] which we require of them? 

neither can this be supposed. 
and so, glaucon, i said, we have at [[last]] arrived at the hymn of dialectic.
this is that strain which is of the [[intellect]] only, but which the
faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight,
as you may [[remember]], was imagined by us after a while to behold the
real animals and stars, and [[last]] of all the sun himself. and so with
dialectic; when a [[person]] starts on the discovery of the absolute by
the [[light]] of [[reason]] only, and without any assistance of sense, and
perseveres until by pure [[intelligence]] he arrives at the perception
of the absolute [[good]], he at [[last]] finds himself at the end of the intellectual
world, as in the case of sight at the end of the visible.

exactly, he said. 
then this is the [[progress]] which you call dialectic? 
true. 
but the release of the prisoners [[prisoner]] from chains, and their translation
from the shadows to the images and to the [[light]], and the ascent from
the underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly
trying to look on animals and plants and the [[light]] of the sun, but
are able to perceive even with their [[weak]] [[eyes]] the images in the water
(which are divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows
of images cast by a [[light]] of [[fire]], which compared with the sun is
only an image) --this [[power]] of elevating the highest [[principle]] in
the [[soul]] to the contemplation of that which is [[best]] in existence,
with which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the
very [[light]] of the [[body]] to the sight of that which is brightest in
the material and visible [[world]] --this [[power]] is given, as i was saying,
by all that study and pursuit of the [[arts]] which has been described.

i agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to [[believe]],
yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny. this, however,
is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but will have to
be discussed again and again. and so, whether our conclusion be true
or false, let us assume all this, and proceed at once from the prelude
or preamble to the [[chief]] strain, and describe that in like manner.
say, then, what is the [[nature]] and what are the divisions of dialectic,
and what are the paths which lead thither; for these paths will also
lead to our final rest? 

dear glaucon, i said, you will not be able to [[follow]] me here, though
i would do my [[best]], and you should behold not an image only but the
absolute [[truth]], according to my notion. whether what i told you would
or would not have been a reality i cannot venture to say; but you
would have seen something like reality; of that i am confident.

doubtless, he replied. 
but i must also remind you, that the [[power]] of dialectic alone can
reveal this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences [[science]].

of that assertion you may be as confident as of the [[last]].

and assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of
comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining
what each thing is in its own [[nature]]; for the [[arts]] in general are
concerned with the desires [[desire]] or opinions [[opinion]] of [[men]], or are cultivated with
a view to production and construction, or for the preservation of
such productions and constructions; and as to the mathematical sciences
which, as we were saying, have some apprehension of true being --geometry
and the like --they only [[dream]] about being, but never can they behold
the waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they
use unexamined, and are unable to give an account of them. for when
a [[man]] knows [[know]] not his own first [[principle]], and when the conclusion and
intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows [[know]] not what,
how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become
science? 

impossible, he said. 
then dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first principle
and is the only [[science]] which does away with hypotheses in order to
make her ground secure; the eye of the [[soul]], which is literally buried
in an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards; and
she uses as handmaids and helpers in the [[work]] of conversion, the sciences
which we have been discussing. custom terms them sciences [[science]], but they
ought to have some other name, implying greater clearness than opinion
and less clearness than [[science]]: and this, in our previous sketch,
was called understanding. but why should we dispute about names when
we have realities of such importance to consider? 

why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought
of the [[mind]] with clearness? 

at any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions;
two for [[intellect]] and two for [[opinion]], and to call the first division
science, the second understanding, the third [[belief]], and the fourth
perception of shadows, [[opinion]] being concerned with becoming, and
intellect with being; and so to make a proportion: -- 

as being is to becoming, so is pure [[intellect]] to [[opinion]].

and as [[intellect]] is to [[opinion]], so is [[science]] to [[belief]], and understanding
to the perception of shadows. but let us defer the further correlation
and subdivision of the subjects [[subject]] of [[opinion]] and of [[intellect]], for it
will be a long enquiry, many times [[time]] longer than this has been.

as far as i [[understand]], he said, i agree. 
and do you also agree, i said, in describing the dialectician as one
who attains a conception of the essence of each thing? and he who
does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception,
in whatever [[degree]] he fails, may in that [[degree]] also be said to fail
in [[intelligence]]? will you admit so much? 

yes, he said; how can i deny it? 
and you would say the same of the conception of the [[good]]?

until the [[person]] is able to abstract and define rationally the idea
of [[good]], and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and
is ready to disprove them, not by appeals to [[opinion]], but to absolute
truth, never faltering at any step of the argument --unless he can
do all this, you would say that he knows [[know]] neither the [[idea]] of good
nor any other [[good]]; he apprehends only a shadow, if anything at all,
which is given by [[opinion]] and not by [[science]]; --dreaming and slumbering
in this [[life]], before he is well awake here, he arrives at the world
below, and has his final quietus. 

in all that i should most certainly agree with you. 
and surely you would not have the [[children]] of your ideal [[state]], whom
you are nurturing and educating --if the ideal ever becomes a reality
--you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts, having no
reason in them, and yet to be set in [[authority]] over the highest matters?

certainly not. 
then you will make a [[law]] that they shall have such an [[education]] as
will enable them to attain the [[greatest]] [[skill]] in asking and answering
questions? 

yes, he said, you and i together will make it. 
dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences [[science]],
and is set over them; no other [[science]] can be placed higher --the
nature of [[knowledge]] can no further go? 

i agree, he said. 
but to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are
to be assigned, are questions [[question]] which remain to be considered?

yes, clearly. 
you [[remember]], i said, how the rulers were chosen before?

certainly, he said. 
the same natures [[nature]] must still be chosen, and the preference again given
to the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and,
having [[noble]] and generous tempers, they should also have the natural
gifts which will facilitate their [[education]]. 

and what are these? 
such gifts as keenness and ready powers [[power]] of acquisition; for the mind
more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity
of gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not
shared with the [[body]]. 

very true, he replied. 
further, he of whom we are in search should have a [[good]] memory, and
be an unwearied solid [[man]] who is a lover of [[labour]] in any line; or
he will never be able to endure the [[great]] amount of bodily exercise
and to go through all the intellectual discipline and study which
we require of him. 

certainly, he said; he must have [[natural]] gifts. 
the mistake at [[present]] is, that those who study [[philosophy]] have no
vocation, and this, as i was before saying, is the [[reason]] why she
has fallen into disrepute: her true sons [[son]] should take her by the hand
and not bastards. 

what do you mean? 
in the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting industry
--i mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle: as,
for [[example]], when a [[man]] is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all
other bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour
of learning or listening or enquiring. or the occupation to which
he devotes himself may be of an opposite [[kind]], and he may have the
other sort of lameness. 

certainly, he said. 
and as to [[truth]], i said, is not a [[soul]] equally to be deemed halt and
lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at
herself and others when they tell lies [[lie]], but is patient of involuntary
falsehood, and does not [[mind]] wallowing like a swinish beast in the
mire of ignorance, and has no shame at being detected? 

to be sure. 
and, again, in [[respect]] of temperance, [[courage]], magnificence, and every
other [[virtue]], should we not carefully distinguish between the true
son and the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities
states and individuals [[individual]] unconsciously err and the [[state]] makes a ruler,
and the [[individual]] a friend, of one who, being defective in some part
of [[virtue]], is in a figure lame or a bastard. 

that is very true, he said. 
all these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by us;
and if only those whom we introduce to this vast [[system]] of education
and training are sound in [[body]] and [[mind]], [[justice]] herself will have
nothing to say against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution
and of the [[state]]; but, if our pupils are [[men]] of another stamp, the
reverse will happen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule
on [[philosophy]] than she has to endure at [[present]]. 

that would not be creditable. 
certainly not, i said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into
earnest i am equally ridiculous. 

in what [[respect]]? 
i had forgotten, i said, that we were not serious, and spoke with
too much excitement. for when i saw [[philosophy]] so undeservedly trampled
under foot of [[men]] i could not [[help]] feeling a sort of indignation at
the authors of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.

indeed! i was listening, and did not [[think]] so. 
but i, who am the speaker, [[felt]] that i was. and now let me remind
you that, although in our former selection we chose old [[men]], we must
not do so in this. solon was under a delusion when he said that a
man when he grows old may learn many things --for he can no more learn
much than he can run much; [[youth]] is the [[time]] for any extraordinary
toil. 

of course. 
and, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements
of instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented
to the [[mind]] in [[childhood]]; not, however, under any notion of forcing
our [[system]] of [[education]]. 

why not? 
because a freeman ought not to be a [[slave]] in the acquisition of knowledge
of any [[kind]]. bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the
body; but [[knowledge]] which is acquired under compulsion obtains no
hold on the [[mind]]. 

very true. 
then, my [[good]] friend, i said, do not use compulsion, but let early
education be a sort of amusement; you will then be [[better]] able to
find out the [[natural]] bent. 

that is a very [[rational]] notion, he said. 
do you [[remember]] that the [[children]], too, were to be taken to see the
battle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to
be brought close up and, like [[young]] hounds, have a taste of blood
given them? 

yes, i [[remember]]. 
the same practice may be followed, i said, in all these things --labours,
lessons, dangers --and he who is most at [[home]] in all of them ought
to be enrolled in a select number. 

at what [[age]]? 
at the [[age]] when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether
of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless
for any other [[purpose]]; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to
learning; and the [[trial]] of who is first in gymnastic exercises is
one of the most important tests to which our [[youth]] are subjected.

certainly, he replied. 
after that [[time]] those who are selected from the class of twenty years
old will be promoted to higher [[honour]], and the sciences [[science]] which they
learned without any order in their early [[education]] will now be brought
together, and they will be able to see the [[natural]] relationship of
them to one another and to true being. 

yes, he said, that is the only [[kind]] of [[knowledge]] which takes lasting
root. 

yes, i said; and the capacity for such [[knowledge]] is the [[great]] criterion
of dialectical talent: the comprehensive [[mind]] is always the dialectical.

i agree with you, he said. 
these, i said, are the points which you must consider; and those who
have most of this comprehension, and who are more steadfast in their
learning, and in their [[military]] and other appointed duties [[duty]], when they
have arrived at the [[age]] of thirty have to be chosen by you out of
the select class, and elevated to higher [[honour]]; and you will have
to prove them by the [[help]] of dialectic, in order to learn which of
them is able to give up the use of sight and the other senses, and
in company with [[truth]] to attain absolute being: and here, my friend,
great caution is required. 

why [[great]] caution? 
do you not remark, i said, how [[great]] is the [[evil]] which dialectic has
introduced? 

what [[evil]]? he said. 
the students of the art [[arts]] are filled with lawlessness. 
quite true, he said. 
do you [[think]] that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable
in their case? or will you make allowance for them? 

in what way make allowance? 
i want you, i said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious
son who is brought up in [[great]] [[wealth]]; he is one of a [[great]] and numerous
family, and has many flatterers. when he grows up to manhood, he learns
that his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he
is unable to discover. can you guess how he will be likely to behave
towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during
the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again
when he knows [[know]]? or shall i guess for you? 

if you please. 
then i should say, that while he is ignorant of the [[truth]] he will
be likely to [[honour]] his [[father]] and his [[mother]] and his supposed relations
more than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them
when in need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be
less willing to disobey them in any important matter. 

he will. 
but when he has made the discovery, i should imagine that he would
diminish his [[honour]] and regard for them, and would become more devoted
to the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase;
he would now [[live]] after their ways, and openly associate with them,
and, unless he were of an unusually [[good]] disposition, he would trouble
himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations.

well, all that is very probable. but how is the image applicable to
the disciples of [[philosophy]]? 

in this way: you [[know]] that there are [[certain]] principles [[principle]] about justice
and [[honour]], which were taught us in [[childhood]], and under their parental
authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.

that is true. 
there are also opposite maxims [[maxim]] and habits of [[pleasure]] which flatter
and attract the [[soul]], but do not influence those of us who have any
sense of [[right]], and they continue to obey and [[honour]] the maxims [[maxim]] of
their fathers [[father]]. 

true. 
now, when a [[man]] is in this [[state]], and the questioning spirit asks
what is [[fair]] or honourable, and he answers [[answer]] as the legislator has taught
him, and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he
is driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than
dishonourable, or just and [[good]] any more than the reverse, and so
of all the notions which he most valued, do you [[think]] that he will
still [[honour]] and obey them as before? 

impossible. 
and when he ceases to [[think]] them honourable and [[natural]] as heretofore,
and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any
life other than that which flatters his desires [[desire]]? 

he cannot. 
and from being a keeper of the [[law]] he is converted into a breaker
of it? 

unquestionably. 
now all this is very [[natural]] in students of [[philosophy]] such as i have
described, and also, as i was just now saying, most excusable.

yes, he said; and, i may add, pitiable. 
therefore, that your feelings may not be moved to [[pity]] about our citizens
who are now thirty years of [[age]], every [[care]] must be taken in introducing
them to dialectic. 

certainly. 
there is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early;
for youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the
taste in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting
and refuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs,
they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them.

yes, he said, there is nothing which they like [[better]]. 
and when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the
hands of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing
anything which they believed before, and hence, not only they, but
philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a [[bad]] name with
the rest of the [[world]]. 

too true, he said. 
but when a [[man]] begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of
such insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for
truth, and not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement;
and the greater moderation of his [[character]] will increase instead
of diminishing the [[honour]] of the pursuit. 

very true, he said. 
and did we not make special provision for this, when we said that
the disciples of [[philosophy]] were to be orderly and steadfast, not,
as now, any [[chance]] aspirant or intruder? 

very true. 
suppose, i said, the study of [[philosophy]] to take the place of gymnastics
and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice
the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise --will that
be enough? 

would you say six or four years? he [[asked]]. 
say five years, i replied; at the end of the [[time]] they must be sent
down again into the den and compelled to hold any [[military]] or other
office which [[young]] [[men]] are qualified to hold: in this way they will
get their [[experience]] of [[life]], and there will be an opportunity of
trying whether, when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation,
they will stand firm or flinch. 

and how long is this stage of their lives [[life]] to [[last]]? 
fifteen years, i answered; and when they have reached fifty years
of [[age]], then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves
in every action of their lives [[life]] and in every branch of [[knowledge]] come
at [[last]] to their consummation; the [[time]] has now arrived at which they
must raise the eye of the [[soul]] to the universal [[light]] which lightens
all things, and behold the absolute [[good]]; for that is the, pattern
according to which they are to order the [[state]] and the lives [[life]] of individuals [[individual]],
and the remainder of their own lives [[life]] also; making [[philosophy]] their
chief pursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics
and ruling for the [[public]] [[good]], not as though they were performing
some heroic action, but simply as a matter of [[duty]]; and when they
have brought up in each [[generation]] others like themselves and left
them in their place to be governors of the [[state]], then they will depart
to the islands of the blest and dwell there; and the [[city]] will give
them [[public]] memorials and sacrifices [[sacrifice]] and [[honour]] them, if the pythian
oracle [[consent]], as demi-gods, but if not, as in any case blessed and
divine. 

you are a sculptor, [[socrates]], and have made statues of our governors
faultless in [[beauty]]. 

yes, i said, glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not
suppose that what i have been saying applies to [[men]] only and not to
women as far as their natures [[nature]] can go. 

there you are [[right]], he said, since we have made them to share in
all things like the [[men]]. 

well, i said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has been
said about the [[state]] and the [[government]] is not a mere [[dream]], and although
difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has been
supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings [[king]] are born
in a [[state]], one or more of them, despising the honours [[honour]] of this present
world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all things
right and the [[honour]] that springs from [[right]], and regarding justice
as the [[greatest]] and most necessary of all things, whose ministers
they are, and whose principles [[principle]] will be exalted by them when they set
in order their own [[city]]? 

how will they proceed? 
they will begin by sending out into the [[country]] all the inhabitants
of the [[city]] who are more than ten years old, and will take possession
of their [[children]], who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents;
these they will train in their own habits and laws [[law]], i mean in the
laws which we have given them: and in this way the [[state]] and constitution
of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain [[happiness]],
and the nation which has such a [[constitution]] will gain most.

yes, that will be the [[best]] way. and i [[think]], [[socrates]], that you have
very well described how, if ever, such a [[constitution]] might come into
being. 

enough then of the [[perfect]] [[state]], and of the [[man]] who bears its image
--there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.

there is no difficulty, he replied; and i agree with you in thinking
that nothing more need be said. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book viii

socrates - glaucon 

and so, glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect
state wives [[wife]] and [[children]] are to be in [[common]]; and that all education
and the pursuits of [[war]] and [[peace]] are also to be [[common]], and the best
philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings [[king]]?

that, replied glaucon, has been acknowledged. 
yes, i said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors,
when appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them
in houses such as we were describing, which are [[common]] to all, and
contain nothing private, or [[individual]]; and about their [[property]],
you [[remember]] what we agreed? 

yes, i [[remember]] that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions
of [[mankind]]; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving
from the other [[citizens]], in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance,
and they were to take [[care]] of themselves and of the whole [[state]].

true, i said; and now that this division of our task is concluded,
let us find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into
the old path. 

there is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that
you had finished the description of the [[state]]: you said that such
a [[state]] was [[good]], and that the [[man]] was [[good]] who answered to it, although,
as now appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of state
and [[man]]. and you said further, that if this was the true form, then
the others were false; and of the false forms, you said, as i [[remember]],
that there were four principal ones, and that their defects, and the
defects of the individuals [[individual]] corresponding to them, were worth examining.
when we had seen all the individuals [[individual]], and finally agreed as to who
was the [[best]] and who was the worst of them, we were to consider whether
the [[best]] was not also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable.
i [[asked]] you what were the four forms of [[government]] of which you spoke,
and then polemarchus and adeimantus put in their word; and you began
again, and have found your way to the point at which we have now arrived.

your recollection, i said, is most exact. 
then, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in
the same position; and let me ask the same questions [[question]], and do you give
me the same [[answer]] which you were about to give me then.

yes, if i can, i will, i said. 
i shall particularly [[wish]] to hear what were the four constitutions
of which you were speaking. 

that [[question]], i said, is easily answered: the four governments [[government]] of
which i spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those
of crete and sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed
oligarchy comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form
of [[government]] which teems with evils [[evil]]: thirdly, [[democracy]], which naturally
follows [[oligarchy]], although very different: and lastly comes [[tyranny]],
great and famous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and
worst disorder of a [[state]]. i do not [[know]], do you? of any other constitution
which can be said to have a distinct [[character]]. there are lordships
and principalities which are bought and sold, and some other intermediate
forms of [[government]]. but these are nondescripts and may be found equally
among hellenes and among barbarians. 

yes, he replied, we certainly hear of many [[curious]] forms of government
which [[exist]] among them. 

do you [[know]], i said, that governments [[government]] vary as the dispositions of
men vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of
the other? for we cannot suppose that states are made of 'oak and
rock,' and not out of the [[human]] natures [[nature]] which are in them, and which
in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them?

yes, he said, the states are as the [[men]] are; they grow out of human
characters. 

then if the constitutions [[constitution]] of states are five, the dispositions of
individual minds [[mind]] will also be five? 

certainly. 
him who answers [[answer]] to [[aristocracy]], and whom we rightly call just and
good, we have already described. 

we have. 
then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures [[nature]],
being the contentious and ambitious, who [[answer]] to the spartan polity;
also the oligarchical, democratical, and [[tyrannical]]. let us place
the most just by the side of the most [[unjust]], and when we see them
we shall be able to compare the relative [[happiness]] or unhappiness
of him who leads a [[life]] of pure [[justice]] or pure [[injustice]]. the enquiry
will then be completed. and we shall [[know]] whether we ought to pursue
injustice, as thrasymachus advises, or in accordance with the conclusions
of the argument to prefer [[justice]]. 

certainly, he replied, we must do as you say. 
shall we [[follow]] our old plan, which we adopted with a view to clearness,
of taking the [[state]] first and then proceeding to the [[individual]], and
begin with the [[government]] of [[honour]]? --i [[know]] of no name for such
a [[government]] other than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. we will compare
with this the like [[character]] in the [[individual]]; and, after that, consider
oligarchical [[man]]; and then again we will turn our attention to democracy
and the democratical [[man]]; and lastly, we will go and view the city
of [[tyranny]], and once more take a look into the tyrant's [[soul]], and
try to arrive at a satisfactory decision. 

that way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable.

first, then, i said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government
of honour) arises out of [[aristocracy]] (the [[government]] of the best).
clearly, all [[political]] changes [[change]] originate in divisions of the actual
governing [[power]]; a [[government]] which is [[united]], however small, cannot
be moved. 

very true, he said. 
in what way, then, will our [[city]] be moved, and in what manner the
two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or
with one another? shall we, after the manner of [[homer]], [[pray]] the muses
to tell us 'how discord first arose'? shall we imagine them in solemn
mockery, to play and jest with us as if we were [[children]], and to address
us in a lofty tragic vein, making [[believe]] to be in earnest?

how would they address us? 
after this manner: --a [[city]] which is thus constituted can hardly be
shaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also
an end, even a [[constitution]] such as yours will not [[last]] for ever,
but will in [[time]] be dissolved. and this is the dissolution: --in plants
that grow in the [[earth]], as well as in animals that move on the earth's
surface, fertility and sterility of [[soul]] and [[body]] occur when the circumferences
of the circles of each are completed, which in short-lived existences
pass over a short space, and in long-lived ones over a long space.
but to the [[knowledge]] of [[human]] fecundity and sterility all the wisdom
and [[education]] of your rulers will not attain; the laws [[law]] which regulate
them will not be discovered by an [[intelligence]] which is alloyed with
sense, but will escape them, and they will bring [[children]] into the
world when they ought not. now that which is of [[divine]] birth has a
period which is contained in a [[perfect]] number, but the period of human
birth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by involution
and evolution (or squared and cubed) obtaining three intervals and
four terms of like and unlike, waxing and waning numbers, make all
the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another. the base of
these (3) with a third added (4) when combined with five (20) and
raised to the third [[power]] furnishes two harmonies; the first a square
which is a hundred times [[time]] as [[great]] (400 = 4 x 100), and the other a
figure having one side [[equal]] to the former, but oblong, consisting
of a hundred numbers squared upon [[rational]] diameters of a square (i.
e. omitting fractions), the side of which is five (7 x 7 = 49 x 100
= 4900), each of them being less by one (than the [[perfect]] square which
includes the fractions, sc. 50) or less by two [[perfect]] squares of
irrational diameters (of a square the side of which is five = 50 +
50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of three (27 x 100 = 2700 + 4900 +
400 = 8000). now this number represents a geometrical figure which
has control over the [[good]] and [[evil]] of births. for when your guardians
are ignorant of the [[law]] of births, and unite bride and bridegroom
out of season, the [[children]] will not be goodly or fortunate. and though
only the [[best]] of them will be appointed by their predecessors, still
they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they
come into [[power]] as guardians, they will soon be found to fall in taking
care of us, the muses, first by under-valuing [[music]]; which neglect
will soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the [[young]] [[men]] of your state
will be less cultivated. in the succeeding [[generation]] rulers will
be appointed who have lost the guardian [[power]] of testing the metal
of your different races [[race]], which, like hesiod's, are of gold and silver
and brass and iron. and so iron will be mingled with silver, and brass
with gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality
and irregularity, which always and in all places are causes of hatred
and [[war]]. this the muses affirm to be the stock from which discord
has sprung, wherever arising; and this is their [[answer]] to us.

yes, and we may assume that they [[answer]] truly. 
why, yes, i said, of course they [[answer]] truly; how can the muses speak
falsely? 

and what do the muses say next? 
when discord arose, then the two races [[race]] were drawn different ways:
the iron and brass fell to acquiring [[money]] and [[land]] and houses and
gold and silver; but the gold and silver races [[race]], not wanting money
but having the true riches [[rich]] in their own [[nature]], inclined towards virtue
and the ancient order of things. there was a [[battle]] between them,
and at [[last]] they agreed to distribute their [[land]] and houses among
individual owners; and they enslaved their [[friends]] and maintainers,
whom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen, and
made of them subjects [[subject]] and servants; and they themselves were engaged
in [[war]] and in keeping a watch against them. 

i [[believe]] that you have rightly conceived the origin of the [[change]].

and the new [[government]] which thus arises will be of a form intermediate
between [[oligarchy]] and [[aristocracy]]? 

very true. 
such will be the [[change]], and after the [[change]] has been made, how will
they proceed? clearly, the new [[state]], being in a mean between oligarchy
and the [[perfect]] [[state]], will partly [[follow]] one and partly the other,
and will also have some peculiarities. 

true, he said. 
in the [[honour]] given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class
from agriculture, handicrafts, and [[trade]] in general, in the institution
of [[common]] meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military
training --in all these respects [[respect]] this [[state]] will resemble the former.

true. 
but in the [[fear]] of admitting [[philosophers]] to [[power]], because they are
no longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements;
and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters [[character]],
who are by [[nature]] fitted for [[war]] rather than [[peace]]; and in the value
set by them upon [[military]] stratagems and contrivances, and in the
waging of everlasting wars [[war]] --this [[state]] will be for the most part
peculiar. 

yes. 
yes, i said; and [[men]] of this stamp will be covetous of [[money]], like
those who [[live]] in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing
after gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having
magazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment
of them; also castles which are just nests for their eggs, and in
which they will spend large sums on their wives [[wife]], or on any others
whom they please. 

that is most true, he said. 
and they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring
the [[money]] which they prize; they will spend that which is another
man's on the gratification of their desires [[desire]], stealing their pleasures
and running away like [[children]] from the [[law]], their [[father]]: they have
been schooled not by gentle influences but by [[force]], for they have
neglected her who is the true muse, the companion of [[reason]] and [[philosophy]],
and have honoured gymnastic more than [[music]]. 

undoubtedly, he said, the form of [[government]] which you describe is
a mixture of [[good]] and [[evil]]. 

why, there is a mixture, i said; but one thing, and one thing only,
is predominantly seen, --the spirit of contention and [[ambition]]; and
these are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.

assuredly, he said. 
such is the origin and such the [[character]] of this [[state]], which has
been described in outline only; the more [[perfect]] execution was not
required, for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly
just and most perfectly [[unjust]]; and to go through all the states and
all the characters [[character]] of [[men]], omitting none of them, would be an interminable
labour. 

very true, he replied. 
now what [[man]] answers [[answer]] to this form of government-how did he come into
being, and what is he like? 

socrates - adeimantus 

i [[think]], said adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which characterises
him, he is not unlike our friend glaucon. 

perhaps, i said, he may be like him in that one point; but there are
other respects [[respect]] in which he is very different. 

in what respects [[respect]]? 
he should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and
yet a friend of [[culture]]; and he should be a [[good]] listener, but no
speaker. such a [[person]] is apt to be rough with slaves [[slave]], unlike the
educated [[man]], who is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous
to freemen, and remarkably [[obedient]] to [[authority]]; he is a lover of
power and a lover of [[honour]]; claiming to be a ruler, not because he
is eloquent, or on any ground of that sort, but because he is a soldier
and has performed feats of arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises
and of the chase. 

yes, that is the type of [[character]] which answers [[answer]] to timocracy.

such an one will despise riches [[rich]] only when he is [[young]]; but as he gets
older he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a
piece of the avaricious [[nature]] in him, and is not singleminded towards
virtue, having lost his [[best]] guardian. 

who was that? said adeimantus. 
philosophy, i said, tempered with [[music]], who comes and takes her abode
in a [[man]], and is the only saviour of his [[virtue]] throughout [[life]].

good, he said. 
such, i said, is the timocratical [[youth]], and he is like the timocratical
state. 

exactly. 
his origin is as follows: --he is often the [[young]] [[son]] of a grave [[father]],
who dwells in an ill-governed [[city]], of which he declines the honours
and offices, and will not go to [[law]], or exert himself in any way,
but is ready to waive his rights [[right]] in order that he may escape trouble.

and how does the [[son]] come into being? 
the [[character]] of the [[son]] begins to develop when he hears his mother
complaining that her husband has no place in the [[government]], of which
the consequence is that she has no precedence among other [[women]]. further,
when she sees her husband not very eager about [[money]], and instead
of battling and railing in the [[law]] courts or assembly, taking whatever
happens to him quietly; and when she observes that his thoughts [[thought]] always
centre in himself, while he treats her with very considerable indifference,
she is annoyed, and says to her [[son]] that his [[father]] is only half a
man and far too easy-going: adding all the other complaints about
her own ill-treatment which [[women]] are so fond of rehearsing.

yes, said adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints
are so like themselves. 

and you [[know]], i said, that the old servants also, who are supposed
to be attached to the [[family]], from [[time]] to [[time]] talk privately in
the same strain to the [[son]]; and if they see any one who owes money
to his [[father]], or is wronging him in any way, and he falls to prosecute
them, they tell the [[youth]] that when he grows up he must retaliate
upon [[people]] of this sort, and be more of a [[man]] than his [[father]]. he
has only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing:
those who do their own [[business]] in the [[city]] are called simpletons,
and held in no esteem, while the busy-bodies are honoured and applauded.
the result is that the [[young]] [[man]], hearing and seeing all these thing
--hearing too, the words of his [[father]], and having a nearer view of
his way of [[life]], and making comparisons of him and others --is drawn
opposite ways: while his [[father]] is watering and nourishing the rational
principle in his [[soul]], the others are encouraging the passionate and
appetitive; and he being not originally of a [[bad]] [[nature]], but having
kept [[bad]] company, is at [[last]] brought by their joint influence to a
middle point, and gives up the [[kingdom]] which is within him to the
middle [[principle]] of contentiousness and passion, and becomes arrogant
and ambitious. 

you seem to me to have described his origin perfectly. 
then we have now, i said, the second form of [[government]] and the second
type of [[character]]? 

we have. 
next, let us look at another [[man]] who, as aeschylus says,

is set over against another [[state]]; or rather, as our plan requires,
begin with the [[state]]. 

by all means. 
i [[believe]] that [[oligarchy]] follows next in order. 
and what manner of [[government]] do you term [[oligarchy]]? 
a [[government]] resting on a valuation of [[property]], in which the rich
have [[power]] and the [[poor]] [[man]] is deprived of it. 

i [[understand]], he replied. 
ought i not to begin by describing how the [[change]] from timocracy to
oligarchy arises? 

yes. 
well, i said, no [[eyes]] are required in order to see how the one passes
into the other. 

how? 
the accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals [[individual]] is
ruin the of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for
what do they or their wives [[wife]] [[care]] about the [[law]]? 

yes, indeed. 
and then one, seeing another grow [[rich]], seeks to rival him, and thus
the [[great]] mass of the [[citizens]] become lovers of [[money]]. 

likely enough. 
and so they grow richer and richer, and the more they [[think]] of making
a [[fortune]] the less they [[think]] of [[virtue]]; for when riches [[rich]] and virtue
are placed together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises
as the other falls. 

true. 
and in proportion as riches [[rich]] and [[rich]] [[men]] are honoured in the [[state]],
virtue and the [[virtuous]] are dishonoured. 

clearly. 
and what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no [[honour]] is
neglected. 

that is obvious. 
and so at [[last]], instead of loving contention and [[glory]], [[men]] become
lovers of [[trade]] and [[money]]; they [[honour]] and look up to the [[rich]] [[man]],
and make a ruler of him, and dishonour the [[poor]] [[man]]. 

they do so. 
they next proceed to make a [[law]] which fixes a sum of [[money]] as the
qualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower
in another, as the [[oligarchy]] is more or less exclusive; and they allow
no one whose [[property]] falls below the amount fixed to have any share
in the [[government]]. these changes [[change]] in the [[constitution]] they effect by
force of arms, if intimidation has not already done their [[work]].

very true. 
and this, speaking generally, is the way in which [[oligarchy]] is established.

yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of [[government]],
and what are the defects of which we were speaking? 

first of all, i said, consider the [[nature]] of the qualification just
think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their
property, and a [[poor]] [[man]] were refused permission to steer, even though
he were a [[better]] pilot? 

you mean that they would shipwreck? 
yes; and is not this true of the [[government]] of anything?

i should imagine so. 
except a [[city]]? --or would you include a [[city]]? 
nay, he said, the case of a [[city]] is the strongest of all, inasmuch
as the [[rule]] of a [[city]] is the [[greatest]] and most difficult of all.

this, then, will be the first [[great]] defect of [[oligarchy]]?

clearly. 
and here is another defect which is quite as [[bad]]. 
what defect? 
the inevitable division: such a [[state]] is not one, but two states,
the one of [[poor]], the other of [[rich]] [[men]]; and they are living on the
same spot and always conspiring against one another. 

that, surely, is at least as [[bad]]. 
another discreditable feature is, that, for a like [[reason]], they are
incapable of carrying on any [[war]]. either they arm the multitude, and
then they are more afraid of them than of the [[enemy]]; or, if they do
not call them out in the hour of [[battle]], they are oligarchs indeed,
few to [[fight]] as they are few to [[rule]]. and at the same [[time]] their fondness
for [[money]] makes them unwilling to [[pay]] taxes. 

how discreditable! 
and, as we said before, under such a [[constitution]] the same persons
have too many callings --they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors,
all in one. does that look well? 

anything but well. 
there is another [[evil]] which is, perhaps, the [[greatest]] of all, and
to which this [[state]] first begins to be liable. 

what [[evil]]? 
a [[man]] may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his [[property]];
yet after the sale he may dwell in the [[city]] of which he is no longer
a part, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite,
but only a [[poor]], helpless creature. 

yes, that is an [[evil]] which also first begins in this [[state]].

the [[evil]] is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both
the extremes of [[great]] [[wealth]] and utter [[poverty]]. 

true. 
but [[think]] again: in his wealthy days, while he was spending his [[money]],
was a [[man]] of this sort a whit more [[good]] to the [[state]] for the purposes
of citizenship? or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling [[body]],
although in [[truth]] he was neither ruler nor [[subject]], but just a spendthrift?

as you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.

may we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the
drone in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city
as the other is of the hive? 

just so, [[socrates]]. 
and [[god]] has made the flying drones, adeimantus, all without stings,
whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but
others have dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who
in their old [[age]] end as paupers; of the stingers come all the criminal
class, as they are termed. 

most true, he said. 
clearly then, whenever you see paupers in a [[state]], somewhere in that
neighborhood there are hidden away thieves, and cutpurses and robbers
of temples, and all sorts of malefactors. 

clearly. 
well, i said, and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers?

yes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.

and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals
to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities
are careful to restrain by [[force]]? 

certainly, we may be so bold. 
the existence of such persons [[person]] is to be attributed to want of [[education]],
ill-training, and an [[evil]] [[constitution]] of the [[state]]? 

true. 
such, then, is the form and such are the evils [[evil]] of [[oligarchy]]; and there
may be many other evils [[evil]]. 

very likely. 
then [[oligarchy]], or the form of [[government]] in which the rulers are
elected for their [[wealth]], may now be dismissed. let us next proceed
to consider the [[nature]] and origin of the [[individual]] who answers [[answer]] to
this [[state]]. 

by all means. 
does not the timocratical [[man]] [[change]] into the oligarchical on this
wise? 

how? 
a [[time]] arrives when the representative of timocracy has a [[son]]: at
first he begins by emulating his [[father]] and walking in his footsteps,
but presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the state
as upon a sunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may
have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial
under a prejudice raised by informers, and either put to [[death]], or
exiled, or deprived of the privileges [[privilege]] of a citizen, and all his property
taken from him. 

nothing more likely. 
and the [[son]] has seen and known all this --he is a ruined [[man]], and
his [[fear]] has taught him to knock [[ambition]] and passion head-foremost
from his bosom's [[throne]]; humbled by [[poverty]] he takes to money-making
and by mean and miserly savings and hard [[work]] gets a [[fortune]] together.
is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element
on the vacant [[throne]] and to suffer it to play the [[great]] [[king]] within
him, girt with tiara and chain and scimitar? 

most true, he replied. 
and when he has made [[reason]] and spirit sit down on the ground obediently
on either side of their [[sovereign]], and taught them to [[know]] their place,
he compels the one to [[think]] only of how lesser sums may be turned
into larger ones, and will not allow the other to [[worship]] and admire
anything but riches [[rich]] and [[rich]] [[men]], or to be ambitious of anything so
much as the acquisition of [[wealth]] and the means of acquiring it.

of all changes [[change]], he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the
conversion of the ambitious [[youth]] into the avaricious one.

and the avaricious, i said, is the oligarchical [[youth]]? 
yes, he said; at any rate the [[individual]] out of whom he came is like
the [[state]] out of which [[oligarchy]] came. 

let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them.

very [[good]]. 
first, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set
upon [[wealth]]? 

certainly. 
also in their penurious, laborious [[character]]; the [[individual]] only
satisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to
them; his other desires [[desire]] he subdues, under the [[idea]] that they are unprofitable.

true. 
he is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes
a purse for himself; and this is the sort of [[man]] whom the vulgar applaud.
is he not a true image of the [[state]] which he represents?

he appears to me to be so; at any rate [[money]] is highly valued by him
as well as by the [[state]]. 

you see that he is not a [[man]] of cultivation, i said. 
i imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made
a blind [[god]] director of his chorus, or given him [[chief]] [[honour]].

excellent! i said. yet consider: must we not further admit that owing
to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires
as of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general
habit of [[life]]? 

true. 
do you [[know]] where you will have to look if you want to discover his
rogueries? 

where must i look? 
you should see him where he has some [[great]] opportunity of acting dishonestly,
as in the guardianship of an orphan. 

aye. 
it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give
him a [[reputation]] for honesty he coerces his [[bad]] [[passions]] by an enforced
virtue; not making them see that they are [[wrong]], or taming them by
reason, but by necessity and [[fear]] constraining them, and because he
trembles for his possessions. 

to be sure. 
yes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the [[natural]] desires
of the drone commonly [[exist]] in him all the same whenever he has to
spend what is not his own. 

yes, and they will be [[strong]] in him too. 
the [[man]], then, will be at [[war]] with himself; he will be two [[men]], and
not one; but, in general, his [[better]] desires [[desire]] will be found to prevail
over his inferior ones. 

true. 
for these reasons [[reason]] such an one will be more respectable than most [[people]];
yet the true [[virtue]] of a unanimous and harmonious [[soul]] will flee far
away and never come near him. 

i should expect so. 
and surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in
a [[state]] for any prize of [[victory]], or other object of honourable [[ambition]];
he will not spend his [[money]] in the contest for [[glory]]; so afraid is
he of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help
and join in the struggle; in true oligarchical [[fashion]] he fights with
a small part only of his resources, and the result commonly is that
he loses the prize and saves his [[money]]. 

very true. 
can we any longer [[doubt]], then, that the miser and money-maker answers
to the oligarchical [[state]]? 

there can be no [[doubt]]. 
next comes [[democracy]]; of this the origin and [[nature]] have still to
be considered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the
democratic [[man]], and bring him up for judgement. 

that, he said, is our method. 
well, i said, and how does the [[change]] from [[oligarchy]] into democracy
arise? is it not on this [[wise]]? --the [[good]] at which such a [[state]] alms
is to become as [[rich]] as possible, a [[desire]] which is insatiable?

what then? 
the rulers, being aware that their [[power]] rests upon their [[wealth]],
refuse to curtail by [[law]] the extravagance of the spendthrift youth
because they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and
buy up their estates and thus increase their own [[wealth]] and importance?

to be sure. 
there can be no [[doubt]] that the [[love]] of [[wealth]] and the spirit of moderation
cannot [[exist]] together in [[citizens]] of the same [[state]] to any considerable
extent; one or the other will be disregarded. 

that is tolerably clear. 
and in oligarchical states, from the general spread of carelessness
and extravagance, [[men]] of [[good]] [[family]] have often been reduced to beggary?

yes, often. 
and still they remain in the [[city]]; there they are, ready to sting
and fully armed, and some of them owe [[money]], some have forfeited their
citizenship; a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate
and conspire against those who have got their [[property]], and against
everybody else, and are eager for [[revolution]]. 

that is true. 
on the other hand, the [[men]] of [[business]], stooping as they walk, and
pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert
their sting --that is, their [[money]] --into some one else who is not
on his guard against them, and recover the parent sum many times [[time]] over
multiplied into a [[family]] of [[children]]: and so they make drone and pauper
to abound in the [[state]]. 

yes, he said, there are plenty of them --that is [[certain]].

the [[evil]] blazes up like a [[fire]]; and they will not extinguish it, either
by restricting a man's [[man]] use of his own [[property]], or by another remedy:

what other? 
one which is the next [[best]], and has the advantage of compelling the
citizens to look to their characters [[character]]: --let there be a general rule
that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk,
and there will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils
of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the [[state]].

yes, they will be greatly lessened. 
at [[present]] the governors, induced by the motives which i have named,
treat their subjects [[subject]] badly; while they and their adherents, especially
the [[young]] [[men]] of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life
of luxury and idleness both of [[body]] and [[mind]]; they do nothing, and
are incapable of resisting either [[pleasure]] or [[pain]]. 

very true. 
they themselves [[care]] only for making [[money]], and are as indifferent
as the pauper to the cultivation of [[virtue]]. 

yes, quite as indifferent. 
such is the [[state]] of affairs which prevails among them. and often
rulers and their subjects [[subject]] may come in one another's way, whether on
a pilgrimage or a march, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye,
and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment
of danger --for where danger is, there is no [[fear]] that the [[poor]] will
be despised by the [[rich]] --and very likely the wiry sunburnt [[poor]] man
may be placed in [[battle]] at the side of a wealthy one who has never
spoilt his [[complexion]] and has plenty of superfluous flesh --when he
sees such an one puffing and at his wit's end, how can he avoid drawing
the conclusion that [[men]] like him are only [[rich]] because no one has
the [[courage]] to despoil them? and when they meet in private will not
people be saying to one another 'our warriors are not [[good]] for much'?

yes, he said, i am quite aware that this is their way of talking.

and, as in a [[body]] which is diseased the addition of a touch from without
may bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no external
provocation a commotion may arise within-in the same way wherever
there is weakness in the [[state]] there is also likely to be illness,
of which the occasions [[occasion]] may be very slight, the one party introducing
from without their oligarchical, the other their democratical allies,
and then the [[state]] falls sick, and is at [[war]] with herself; and may
be at times [[time]] distracted, even when there is no external cause.

yes, surely. 
and then [[democracy]] comes into being after the [[poor]] have conquered
their opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the
remainder they give an [[equal]] share of [[freedom]] and [[power]]; and this
is the form of [[government]] in which the magistrates are commonly elected
by lot. 

yes, he said, that is the [[nature]] of [[democracy]], whether the revolution
has been effected by arms, or whether [[fear]] has caused the opposite
party to withdraw. 

and now what is their manner of [[life]], and what sort of a government
have they? for as the [[government]] is, such will be the [[man]].

clearly, he said. 
in the first place, are they not [[free]]; and is not the [[city]] full of
freedom and frankness --a [[man]] may say and do what he likes?

'tis said so, he replied. 
and where [[freedom]] is, the [[individual]] is clearly able to order for
himself his own [[life]] as he pleases? 

clearly. 
then in this [[kind]] of [[state]] there will be the [[greatest]] variety of human
natures? 

there will. 
this, then, seems likely to be the fairest of states, being an embroidered
robe which is spangled with every sort of flower. and just as women
and [[children]] [[think]] a variety of colours to be of all things most charming,
so there are many [[men]] to whom this [[state]], which is spangled with the
manners and characters [[character]] of [[mankind]], will appear to be the fairest of
states. 

yes. 
yes, my [[good]] sir, and there will be no [[better]] in which to look for
a [[government]]. 

why? 
because of the [[liberty]] which reigns there --they have a complete assortment
of constitutions [[constitution]]; and he who has a [[mind]] to establish a [[state]], as we
have been doing, must go to a [[democracy]] as he would to a bazaar at
which they sell them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when
he has made his [[choice]], he may found his [[state]]. 

he will be sure to have patterns enough. 
and there being no necessity, i said, for you to govern in this [[state]],
even if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like,
or go to [[war]] when the rest go to [[war]], or to be at [[peace]] when others
are at [[peace]], unless you are so disposed --there being no necessity
also, because some [[law]] forbids you to hold office or be a dicast,
that you should not hold office or be a dicast, if you have a fancy
--is not this a way of [[life]] which for the moment is supremely delightful

for the moment, yes. 
and is not their [[humanity]] to the condemned in some cases quite charming?
have you not observed how, in a [[democracy]], many persons [[person]], although
they have been sentenced to [[death]] or [[exile]], just stay where they are
and walk about the [[world]] --the gentleman parades like a hero, and
nobody sees or cares [[care]]? 

yes, he replied, many and many a one. 
see too, i said, the forgiving spirit of [[democracy]], and the 'don't
care' about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the
fine principles [[principle]] which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the
city --as when we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted
nature, there never will be a [[good]] [[man]] who has not from his childhood
been used to play amid things of [[beauty]] and make of them a joy and
a study --how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours
under her feet, never giving a [[thought]] to the pursuits which make
a statesman, and promoting to [[honour]] any one who professes to be the
people's friend. 

yes, she is of a [[noble]] spirit. 
these and other kindred characteristics are proper to [[democracy]], which
is a charming form of [[government]], full of variety and disorder, and
dispensing a sort of equality to equals [[equal]] and unequals alike.

we [[know]] her well. 
consider now, i said, what manner of [[man]] the [[individual]] is, or rather
consider, as in the case of the [[state]], how he comes into being.

very [[good]], he said. 
is not this the way --he is the [[son]] of the miserly and oligarchical
father who has trained him in his own habits? 

exactly. 
and, like his [[father]], he keeps under by [[force]] the pleasures [[pleasure]] which
are of the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which
are called unnecessary? 

obviously. 
would you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are
the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures [[pleasure]]? 

i should. 
are not necessary pleasures [[pleasure]] those of which we cannot get rid, and
of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us? and they are rightly
so, because we are framed by [[nature]] to [[desire]] both what is beneficial
and what is necessary, and cannot [[help]] it. 

true. 
we are not [[wrong]] therefore in calling them necessary? 
we are not. 
and the desires [[desire]] of which a [[man]] may get rid, if he takes pains [[pain]] from
his [[youth]] upwards --of which the presence, moreover, does no [[good]],
and in some cases the reverse of [[good]] --shall we not be [[right]] in saying
that all these are unnecessary? 

yes, certainly. 
suppose we select an [[example]] of either [[kind]], in order that we may
have a general notion of them? 

very [[good]]. 
will not the [[desire]] of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments,
in so far as they are required for health and [[strength]], be of the
necessary class? 

that is what i should suppose. 
the [[pleasure]] of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us [[good]] and
it is essential to the continuance of [[life]]? 

yes. 
but the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are [[good]] for
health? 

certainly. 
and the [[desire]] which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other
luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained
in [[youth]], and is hurtful to the [[body]], and hurtful to the [[soul]] in the
pursuit of [[wisdom]] and [[virtue]], may be rightly called unnecessary?

very true. 
may we not say that these desires [[desire]] spend, and that the others make
money because they conduce to production? 

certainly. 
and of the pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[love]], and all other pleasures [[pleasure]], the same holds
good? 

true. 
and the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures
and desires [[desire]] of this sort, and was the [[slave]] of the unnecessary desires [[desire]],
whereas he who was [[subject]] o the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical?

very true. 
again, let us see how the democratical [[man]] grows out of the oligarchical:
the following, as i suspect, is commonly the process. 

what is the process? 
when a [[young]] [[man]] who has been brought up as we were just now describing,
in a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones' honey and has come
to associate with fierce and crafty natures [[nature]] who are able to provide
for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of [[pleasure]] --then,
as you may imagine, the [[change]] will begin of the oligarchical principle
within him into the democratical? 

inevitably. 
and as in the [[city]] like was helping like, and the [[change]] was effected
by an [[alliance]] from without assisting one division of the [[citizens]],
so too the [[young]] [[man]] is changed by a class of desires [[desire]] coming from
without to assist the desires [[desire]] within him, that which is and alike
again helping that which is akin and alike? 

certainly. 
and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical [[principle]] within
him, whether the influence of a [[father]] or of kindred, advising or
rebuking him, then there arises in his [[soul]] a faction and an opposite
faction, and he goes to [[war]] with himself. 

it must be so. 
and there are times [[time]] when the democratical [[principle]] gives way to the
oligarchical, and some of his desires [[desire]] [[die]], and others are [[banished]];
a spirit of reverence enters into the [[young]] man's [[man]] [[soul]] and order is
restored. 

yes, he said, that sometimes happens. 
and then, again, after the old desires [[desire]] have been driven out, fresh
ones spring up, which are akin to them, and because he, their [[father]],
does not [[know]] how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.

yes, he said, that is apt to be the way. 
they draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse
with them, breed and multiply in him. 

very true. 
at length they seize upon the citadel of the [[young]] man's [[man]] [[soul]], which
they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and [[fair]] pursuits
and true words, which make their abode in the minds [[mind]] of [[men]] who are
dear to the gods, and are their [[best]] guardians and sentinels.

none [[better]]. 
false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their
place. 

they are [[certain]] to do so. 
and so the [[young]] [[man]] returns into the [[country]] of the lotus-eaters,
and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all [[men]]; and if any
help be sent by his [[friends]] to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid
vain conceits shut the gate of the king's fastness; and they will
neither allow the embassy itself to enter, private if private advisers
offer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or
receive them. there is a [[battle]] and they gain the day, and then modesty,
which they call silliness, is ignominiously thrust into [[exile]] by them,
and temperance, which they nickname unmanliness, is trampled in the
mire and cast forth; they persuade [[men]] that moderation and orderly
expenditure are vulgarity and meanness, and so, by the [[help]] of a rabble
of [[evil]] appetites, they drive them beyond the border. 

yes, with a will. 
and when they have emptied and swept clean the [[soul]] of him who is
now in their [[power]] and who is being initiated by them in [[great]] mysteries,
the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy
and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads,
and a [[great]] company with them, hymning their praises [[praise]] and calling them
by sweet names; insolence they term breeding, and [[anarchy]] [[liberty]],
and waste magnificence, and impudence [[courage]]. and so the [[young]] man
passes out of his original [[nature]], which was trained in the school
of necessity, into the [[freedom]] and libertinism of useless and unnecessary
pleasures. 

yes, he said, the [[change]] in him is visible enough. 
after this he lives [[life]] on, spending his [[money]] and [[labour]] and [[time]] on
unnecessary pleasures [[pleasure]] quite as much as on necessary ones; but if he
be fortunate, and is not too much disordered in his wits, when years
have elapsed, and the heyday of passion is over --supposing that he
then re-admits into the [[city]] some part of the exiled virtues [[virtue]], and
does not wholly give himself up to their successors --in that case
he balances his pleasures [[pleasure]] and lives [[life]] in a sort of equilibrium, putting
the [[government]] of himself into the hands of the one which comes first
and wins the turn; and when he has had enough of that, then into the
hands of another; he despises none of them but encourages them all
equally. 

very true, he said. 
neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word
of [[advice]]; if any one says to him that some pleasures [[pleasure]] are the satisfactions
of [[good]] and [[noble]] desires [[desire]], and others of [[evil]] desires [[desire]], and that he
ought to use and [[honour]] some and chastise and master the others --whenever
this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are
all alike, and that one is as [[good]] as another. 

yes, he said; that is the way with him. 
yes, i said, he lives [[life]] from day to day indulging the appetite of the
hour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute;
then he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes
a turn at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything,
then once more living the [[life]] of a philosopher; often he-is busy
with [[politics]], and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes
into his head; and, if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior,
off he is in that direction, or of [[men]] of [[business]], once more in that.
his [[life]] has neither [[law]] nor order; and this distracted existence
he terms joy and bliss and [[freedom]]; and so he goes on. 

yes, he replied, he is all [[liberty]] and equality. 
yes, i said; his [[life]] is motley and manifold and an epitome of the
lives of many; --he answers [[answer]] to the [[state]] which we described as fair
and spangled. and many a [[man]] and many a woman will take him for their
pattern, and many a [[constitution]] and many an [[example]] of manners is
contained in him. 

just so. 
let him then be set over against [[democracy]]; he may truly be called
the democratic [[man]]. 

let that be his place, he said. 
last of all comes the most beautiful of all, [[man]] and [[state]] alike,
tyranny and the [[tyrant]]; these we have now to consider. 

quite true, he said. 
say then, my friend, in what manner does [[tyranny]] arise? --that it
has a democratic origin is evident. 

clearly. 
and does not [[tyranny]] spring from [[democracy]] in the same manner as democracy
from [[oligarchy]] --i mean, after a sort? 

how? 
the [[good]] which [[oligarchy]] proposed to itself and the means by which
it was maintained was excess of [[wealth]] --am i not [[right]]?

yes. 
and the insatiable [[desire]] of [[wealth]] and the neglect of all other things
for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of [[oligarchy]]?

true. 
and [[democracy]] has her own [[good]], of which the insatiable [[desire]] brings
her to dissolution? 

what [[good]]? 
freedom, i replied; which, as they tell you in a [[democracy]], is the
glory of the [[state]] --and that therefore in a [[democracy]] alone will
the freeman of [[nature]] deign to dwell. 

yes; the saying is in everybody's mouth. 
i was going to observe, that the insatiable [[desire]] of this and the
neglect of other things introduces the [[change]] in [[democracy]], which
occasions a demand for [[tyranny]]. 

how so? 
when a [[democracy]] which is thirsting for [[freedom]] has [[evil]] cupbearers
presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the [[strong]] wine
of [[freedom]], then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful
draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that
they are cursed oligarchs. 

yes, he replied, a very [[common]] occurrence. 
yes, i said; and [[loyal]] [[citizens]] are insultingly termed by her slaves
who hug their chains and [[men]] of naught; she would have subjects [[subject]] who
are like rulers, and rulers who are like subjects [[subject]]: these are [[men]] after
her own [[heart]], whom she praises [[praise]] and honours [[honour]] both in private and [[public]].
now, in such a [[state]], can [[liberty]] have any limit? 

certainly not. 
by degrees [[degree]] the [[anarchy]] finds a way into private houses, and ends by
getting among the animals and infecting them. 

how do you mean? 
i mean that the [[father]] grows accustomed to descend to the level of
his sons [[son]] and to [[fear]] them, and the [[son]] is on a level with his [[father]],
he having no [[respect]] or reverence for either of his parents; and this
is his [[freedom]], and metic is [[equal]] with the citizen and the citizen
with the metic, and the stranger is quite as [[good]] as either.

yes, he said, that is the way. 
and these are not the only evils [[evil]], i said --there are several lesser
ones: in such a [[state]] of [[society]] the master fears [[fear]] and flatters his
scholars, and the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young
and old are all alike; and the [[young]] [[man]] is on a level with the old,
and is ready to compete with him in word or deed; and old [[men]] condescend
to the [[young]] and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth
to be [[thought]] morose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the
manners of the [[young]]. 

quite true, he said. 
the [[last]] extreme of popular [[liberty]] is when the [[slave]] bought with
money, whether male or female, is just as [[free]] as his or her purchaser;
nor must i forget to tell of the [[liberty]] and equality of the two sexes
in relation to each other. 

why not, as aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips?

that is what i am doing, i replied; and i must add that no one who
does not [[know]] would [[believe]], how much greater is the [[liberty]] which
the animals who are under the dominion of [[man]] have in a democracy
than in any other [[state]]: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says,
are as [[good]] as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have
a way of marching along with all the rights [[right]] and dignities of freemen;
and they will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not
leave the road clear for them: and all things are just ready to burst
with [[liberty]]. 

when i take a [[country]] walk, he said, i often [[experience]] what you describe.
you and i have dreamed the same thing. 

and above all, i said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive
the [[citizens]] become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of
authority and at length, as you [[know]], they cease to [[care]] even for
the laws [[law]], written or unwritten; they will have no one over them.

yes, he said, i [[know]] it too well. 
such, my friend, i said, is the [[fair]] and glorious beginning out of
which springs [[tyranny]]. 

glorious indeed, he said. but what is the next step? 
the ruin of [[oligarchy]] is the ruin of [[democracy]]; the same disease magnified
and intensified by [[liberty]] overmasters [[democracy]] --the [[truth]] being
that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in
the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons
and in vegetable and animal [[life]], but above all in forms of [[government]].

true. 
the excess of [[liberty]], whether in states or individuals [[individual]], seems only
to pass into excess of [[slavery]]. 

yes, the [[natural]] order. 
and so [[tyranny]] naturally arises out of [[democracy]], and the most aggravated
form of [[tyranny]] and [[slavery]] out of the most extreme form of [[liberty]]?

as we might expect. 
that, however, was not, as i [[believe]], your question-you rather desired
to [[know]] what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy
and [[democracy]], and is the ruin of both? 

just so, he replied. 
well, i said, i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts,
of whom the more courageous are the-leaders and the more timid the
followers, the same whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless,
and others having stings. 

a very just comparison. 
these two classes are the plagues of every [[city]] in which they are
generated, being what phlegm and bile are to the [[body]]. and the good
physician and lawgiver of the [[state]] ought, like the [[wise]] bee-master,
to keep them at a distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming
in; and if they have anyhow found a way in, then he should have them
and their cells cut out as speedily as possible. 

yes, by all means, he said. 
then, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us imagine
democracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes; for
in the first place [[freedom]] creates rather more drones in the democratic
than there were in the oligarchical [[state]]. 

that is true. 
and in the [[democracy]] they are certainly more intensified.

how so? 
because in the oligarchical [[state]] they are disqualified and driven
from office, and therefore they cannot train or gather [[strength]]; whereas
in a [[democracy]] they are almost the entire ruling [[power]], and while
the keener sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema
and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies
almost everything is managed by the drones. 

very true, he said. 
then there is another class which is always being severed from the
mass. 

what is that? 
they are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders sure to be
the richest. 

naturally so. 
they are the most squeezable persons [[person]] and yield the largest amount
of honey to the drones. 

why, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of [[people]] who have
little. 

and this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon them.

that is pretty much the case, he said. 
the [[people]] are a third class, consisting of those who [[work]] with their
own hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to [[live]] upon.
this, when assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a
democracy. 

true, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate
unless they get a little honey. 

and do they not share? i said. do not their leaders deprive the rich
of their estates and distribute them among the [[people]]; at the same
time taking [[care]] to reserve the larger part for themselves?

why, yes, he said, to that extent the [[people]] do share. 
and the persons [[person]] whose [[property]] is taken from them are compelled to
defend themselves before the [[people]] as they [[best]] can? 

what else can they do? 
and then, although they may have no [[desire]] of [[change]], the others charge
them with plotting against the [[people]] and being [[friends]] of [[oligarchy]]?
true. 

and the end is that when they see the [[people]], not of their own accord,
but through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers,
seeking to do them [[wrong]], then at [[last]] they are forced to become oligarchs
in reality; they do not [[wish]] to be, but the sting of the drones torments
them and breeds [[revolution]] in them. 

that is exactly the [[truth]]. 
then come impeachments and judgments [[judgment]] and trials of one another.

true. 
the [[people]] have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse
into greatness. 

yes, that is their way. 
this and no other is the root from which a [[tyrant]] springs; when he
first appears above ground he is a protector. 

yes, that is quite clear. 
how then does a protector begin to [[change]] into a [[tyrant]]? clearly when
he does what the [[man]] is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple
of lycaean [[zeus]]. 

what tale? 
the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a [[single]] human
victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to
become a wolf. did you never hear it? 

oh, yes. 
and the protector of the [[people]] is like him; having a mob entirely
at his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the [[blood]] of kinsmen;
by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court
and murders them, making the [[life]] of [[man]] to disappear, and with unholy
tongue and lips tasting the [[blood]] of his fellow citizen; some he kills
and others he banishes, at the same [[time]] hinting at the abolition
of debts and partition of lands [[land]]: and after this, what will be his
destiny? must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies [[enemy]], or
from being a [[man]] become a wolf --that is, a [[tyrant]]? 

inevitably. 
this, i said, is he who begins to make a party against the [[rich]]?

the same. 
after a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his enemies [[enemy]],
a [[tyrant]] full grown. 

that is clear. 
and if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death
by a [[public]] accusation, they conspire to assassinate him.

yes, he said, that is their usual way. 
then comes the famous request for a bodyguard, which is the device
of all those who have got thus far in their [[tyrannical]] [[career]] --'let
not the people's friend,' as they say, 'be lost to them.'

exactly. 
the [[people]] readily assent; all their fears [[fear]] are for him --they have
none for themselves. 

very true. 
and when a [[man]] who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy
of the [[people]] sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to croesus,

by pebbly hermus' shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed
to be a [[coward]]. 

and quite [[right]] too, said he, for if he were, he would never be ashamed
again. 

but if he is caught he dies. 
of course. 
and he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not 'larding
the plain' with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing
up in the chariot of [[state]] with the reins in his hand, no longer protector,
but [[tyrant]] absolute. 

no [[doubt]], he said. 
and now let us consider the [[happiness]] of the [[man]], and also of the
state in which a creature like him is generated. 

yes, he said, let us consider that. 
at first, in the early days of his [[power]], he is full of smiles, and
he salutes every one whom he meets; --he to be called a [[tyrant]], who
is making promises in [[public]] and also in private! liberating debtors,
and distributing [[land]] to the [[people]] and his followers, and wanting
to be so [[kind]] and [[good]] to every one! 

of course, he said. 
but when he has disposed of [[foreign]] enemies [[enemy]] by [[conquest]] or treaty,
and there is nothing to [[fear]] from them, then he is always stirring
up some [[war]] or other, in order that the [[people]] may require a leader.

to be sure. 
has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished
by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their
daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him? clearly.

and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of [[freedom]],
and of [[resistance]] to his [[authority]], he will have a [[good]] pretext for
destroying them by placing them at the [[mercy]] of the [[enemy]]; and for
all these reasons [[reason]] the [[tyrant]] must be always getting up a [[war]].

he must. 
now he begins to grow unpopular. 
a necessary result. 
then some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in [[power]],
speak their minds [[mind]] to him and to one another, and the more courageous
of them cast in his teeth what is being done. 

yes, that may be expected. 
and the [[tyrant]], if he means to [[rule]], must get rid of them; he cannot
stop while he has a friend or an [[enemy]] who is [[good]] for anything.

he cannot. 
and therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is
high-minded, who is [[wise]], who is wealthy; [[happy]] [[man]], he is the enemy
of them all, and must seek [[occasion]] against them whether he will or
no, until he has made a purgation of the [[state]]. 

yes, he said, and a rare purgation. 
yes, i said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of
the [[body]]; for they take away the worse and leave the [[better]] part,
but he does the reverse. 

if he is to [[rule]], i suppose that he cannot [[help]] himself.

what a blessed alternative, i said: --to be compelled to dwell only
with the many [[bad]], and to be by them hated, or not to [[live]] at all!

yes, that is the alternative. 
and the more detestable his actions are to the [[citizens]] the more satellites
and the greater devotion in them will he require? 

certainly. 
and who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?

they will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if [[lie]] pays
them. 

by the dog! i said, here are more drones, of every sort and from every
land. 

yes, he said, there are. 
but will he not [[desire]] to get them on the spot? 
how do you mean? 
he will rob the [[citizens]] of their slaves [[slave]]; he will then set them free
and enrol them in his bodyguard. 

to be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them [[best]] of all.

what a blessed creature, i said, must this [[tyrant]] be; he has put to
death the others and has these for his trusted [[friends]]. 

yes, he said; they are quite of his sort. 
yes, i said, and these are the new [[citizens]] whom he has called into
existence, who [[admire]] him and are his companions, while the [[good]] hate
and avoid him. 

of course. 
verily, then, tragedy is a [[wise]] thing and euripides a [[great]] tragedian.

why so? 
why, because he is the author of the pregnant saying, 

tyrants are [[wise]] by living with the [[wise]]; and he clearly meant to
say that they are the [[wise]] whom the [[tyrant]] makes his companions.

yes, he said, and he also praises [[praise]] [[tyranny]] as godlike; and many other
things of the same [[kind]] are said by him and by the other poets.

and therefore, i said, the tragic poets being [[wise]] [[men]] will forgive
us and any others who [[live]] after our manner if we do not receive them
into our [[state]], because they are the eulogists of [[tyranny]].

yes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless [[forgive]] us.

but they will continue to go to other cities [[city]] and attract mobs, and
hire voices [[fair]] and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities [[city]] over
to tyrannies and democracies [[democracy]]. 

very true. 
moreover, they are paid for this and receive [[honour]] --the greatest
honour, as might be expected, from tyrants [[tyrant]], and the next greatest
from democracies [[democracy]]; but the higher they ascend our [[constitution]] hill,
the more their [[reputation]] fails, and seems unable from shortness of
breath to proceed further. 

true. 
but we are wandering from the [[subject]]: let us therefore return and
enquire how the [[tyrant]] will maintain that [[fair]] and numerous and various
and ever-changing [[army]] of his. 

if, he said, there are [[sacred]] treasures in the [[city]], he will confiscate
and spend them; and in so far as the fortunes [[fortune]] of attainted persons
may suffice, he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would
otherwise have to impose upon the [[people]]. 

and when these fail? 
why, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male
or female, will be maintained out of his father's estate.

you mean to say that the [[people]], from whom he has derived his being,
will maintain him and his companions? 

yes, he said; they cannot [[help]] themselves. 
but what if the [[people]] fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up
son ought not to be supported by his [[father]], but that the [[father]] should
be supported by the [[son]]? the [[father]] did not bring him into being,
or settle him in [[life]], in order that when his [[son]] became a [[man]] he
should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support
him and his rabble of slaves [[slave]] and companions; but that his [[son]] should
protect him, and that by his [[help]] he might be emancipated from the
government of the [[rich]] and aristocratic, as they are termed. and so
he bids him and his companions depart, just as any other [[father]] might
drive out of the house a riotous [[son]] and his undesirable associates.

by [[heaven]], he said, then the parent will discover what a monster he
has been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out,
he will find that he is [[weak]] and his [[son]] [[strong]]. 

why, you do not mean to say that the [[tyrant]] will use [[violence]]? what!
beat his [[father]] if he opposes him? 

yes, he will, having first disarmed him. 
then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and
this is real [[tyranny]], about which there can be no longer a mistake:
as the saying is, the [[people]] who would escape the smoke which is the
slavery of freemen, has fallen into the [[fire]] which is the tyranny
of slaves [[slave]]. thus [[liberty]], getting out of all order and [[reason]], passes
into the harshest and bitterest form of [[slavery]]. 

true, he said. 
very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed
the [[nature]] of [[tyranny]], and the manner of the transition from democracy
to [[tyranny]]? 

yes, quite enough, he said. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book ix

socrates - adeimantus 

last of all comes the [[tyrannical]] [[man]]; about whom we have once more
to ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he
live, in [[happiness]] or in misery? 

yes, he said, he is the only one remaining. 
there is, however, i said, a previous [[question]] which remains unanswered.

what [[question]]? 
i do not [[think]] that we have adequately determined the [[nature]] and number
of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will
always be confused. 

well, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.

very true, i said; and observe the point which i want to [[understand]]:
certain of the unnecessary pleasures [[pleasure]] and appetites i conceive to be
unlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons [[person]] they
are controlled by the laws [[law]] and by [[reason]], and the [[better]] desires [[desire]] prevail
over them-either they are wholly [[banished]] or they become few and [[weak]];
while in the case of others they are stronger, and there are more
of them. 

which appetites do you mean? 
i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and [[human]] and ruling
power is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or
drink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy
his desires [[desire]]; and there is no conceivable folly or crime --not excepting
incest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of
forbidden food --which at such a [[time]], when he has parted company
with all shame and sense, a [[man]] may not be ready to commit.

most true, he said. 
but when a man's [[man]] pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going
to sleep he has awakened his [[rational]] powers [[power]], and fed them on noble
thoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having
first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but
just enough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments
and pains [[pain]] from interfering with the higher [[principle]] --which he leaves
in the solitude of pure abstraction, [[free]] to contemplate and aspire
to the [[knowledge]] of the unknown, whether in [[past]], [[present]], or future:
when again he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel
against any one --i say, when, after pacifying the two irrational
principles, he rouses up the third, which is [[reason]], before he takes
his rest, then, as you [[know]], he attains [[truth]] most nearly, and is
least likely to be the [[sport]] of fantastic and lawless visions.

i quite agree. 
in saying this i have been running into a digression; but the point
which i [[desire]] to note is that in all of us, even in [[good]] [[men]], there
is a lawless wild-beast [[nature]], which peers out in sleep. [[pray]], consider
whether i am [[right]], and you agree with me. 

yes, i agree. 
and now [[remember]] the [[character]] which we attributed to the democratic
man. he was supposed from his [[youth]] upwards to have been trained under
a miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but
discountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and ornament?

true. 
and then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort
of [[people]], and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite
extreme from an abhorrence of his father's meanness. at [[last]], being
a [[better]] [[man]] than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions
until he halted midway and [[led]] a [[life]], not of vulgar and slavish passion,
but of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures [[pleasure]]. after
this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?

yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.

and now, i said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive
this [[man]], such as he is, to have a [[son]], who is brought up in his father's
principles. 

i can imagine him. 
then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son
which has already happened to the [[father]]: --he is drawn into a perfectly
lawless [[life]], which by his seducers is termed [[perfect]] [[liberty]]; and
his [[father]] and [[friends]] take part with his moderate desires [[desire]], and the
opposite party assist the opposite ones. as soon as these dire magicians
and tyrant-makers find that they are losing their hold on him, they
contrive to implant in him a master passion, to be [[lord]] over his idle
and spendthrift lusts --a sort of monstrous winged drone --that is
the only image which will adequately describe him. 

yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him. 
and when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and
garlands and wines, and all the pleasures [[pleasure]] of a dissolute [[life]], now
let loose, come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting
of [[desire]] which they implant in his drone-like [[nature]], then at last
this [[lord]] of the [[soul]], having madness for the captain of his guard,
breaks out into a frenzy: and if he finds in himself any [[good]] opinions
or appetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense
of shame remaining, to these [[better]] principles [[principle]] he puts an end, and
casts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in
madness to the full. 

yes, he said, that is the way in which the [[tyrannical]] [[man]] is generated.

and is not this the [[reason]] why of old [[love]] has been called a [[tyrant]]?

i should not wonder. 
further, i said, has not a drunken [[man]] also the spirit of a [[tyrant]]?

he has. 
and you [[know]] that a [[man]] who is deranged and not [[right]] in his [[mind]],
will fancy that he is able to [[rule]], not only over [[men]], but also over
the gods? 

that he will. 
and the [[tyrannical]] [[man]] in the true sense of the word comes into being
when, either under the influence of [[nature]], or habit, or both, he
becomes drunken, lustful, passionate? o my friend, is not that so?

assuredly. 
such is the [[man]] and such is his origin. and next, how does he [[live]]?

suppose, as [[people]] facetiously say, you were to tell me.

i imagine, i said, at the next step in his [[progress]], that there will
be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that
sort of thing; [[love]] is the [[lord]] of the house within him, and orders
all the concerns of his [[soul]]. 

that is [[certain]]. 
yes; and every day and every night desires [[desire]] grow up many and formidable,
and their demands are many. 

they are indeed, he said. 
his revenues [[revenue]], if he has any, are soon spent. 
true. 
then comes debt and the cutting down of his [[property]]. 
of course. 
when he has nothing left, must not his desires [[desire]], crowding in the nest
like [[young]] ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by
them, and especially by [[love]] himself, who is in a manner the captain
of them, is in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud
or despoil of his [[property]], in order that he may gratify them?

yes, that is sure to be the case. 
he must have [[money]], no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains
and pangs. 

he must. 
and as in himself there was a succession of pleasures [[pleasure]], and the new
got the [[better]] of the old and took away their rights [[right]], so he being
younger will claim to have more than his [[father]] and his [[mother]], and
if he has spent his own share of the [[property]], he will take a slice
of theirs. 

no [[doubt]] he will. 
and if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all
to [[cheat]] and [[deceive]] them. 

very true. 
and if he fails, then he will use [[force]] and plunder them.

yes, probably. 
and if the old [[man]] and woman [[fight]] for their own, what then, my friend?
will the creature [[feel]] any compunction at tyrannizing over them?

nay, he said, i should not [[feel]] at all comfortable about his parents.

but, o heavens! adeimantus, on account of some newfangled [[love]] of
a harlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe
that he would strike the [[mother]] who is his ancient friend and necessary
to his very existence, and would place her under the [[authority]] of
the other, when she is brought under the same roof with her; or that,
under like circumstances, he would do the same to his withered old
father, first and most indispensable of [[friends]], for the sake of some
newly found blooming [[youth]] who is the reverse of indispensable?

yes, indeed, he said; i [[believe]] that he would. 
truly, then, i said, a [[tyrannical]] [[son]] is a blessing to his father
and [[mother]]. 

he is indeed, he replied. 
he first takes their [[property]], and when that falls, and pleasures
are beginning to swarm in the hive of his [[soul]], then he breaks into
a house, or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he
proceeds to clear a temple. meanwhile the old opinions [[opinion]] which he had
when a child, and which gave [[judgment]] about [[good]] and [[evil]], are overthrown
by those others which have just been emancipated, and are now the
bodyguard of [[love]] and share his [[empire]]. these in his democratic days,
when he was still [[subject]] to the laws [[law]] and to his [[father]], were only
let loose in the dreams [[dream]] of sleep. but now that he is under the dominion
of [[love]], he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then
very rarely and in a [[dream]] only; he will commit the foulest murder,
or [[eat]] forbidden food, or be guilty of any other horrid act. love
is his [[tyrant]], and lives [[life]] lordly in him and lawlessly, and being himself
a [[king]], leads him on, as a [[tyrant]] leads a [[state]], to the performance
of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble
of his associates, whether those whom [[evil]] communications have brought
in from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose
within him by [[reason]] of a similar [[evil]] [[nature]] in himself. have we
not here a picture of his way of [[life]]? 

yes, indeed, he said. 
and if there are only a few of them in the [[state]], the rest of the
people are well disposed, they go away and become the bodyguard or
mercenary soldiers of some other [[tyrant]] who may probably want them
for a [[war]]; and if there is no [[war]], they stay at [[home]] and do many little
pieces of mischief in the [[city]]. 

what sort of mischief? 
for [[example]], they are the thieves, burglars, cutpurses, footpads,
robbers of temples, man-stealers of the [[community]]; or if they are
able to speak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take
bribes. 

a small catalogue of evils [[evil]], even if the perpetrators of them are few
in number. 

yes, i said; but small and [[great]] are comparative terms, and all these
things, in the misery and [[evil]] which they inflict upon a [[state]], do
not come within a thousand miles of the [[tyrant]]; when this noxious
class and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their
strength, assisted by the infatuation of the [[people]], they choose from
among themselves the one who has most of the [[tyrant]] in his own [[soul]],
and him they create their [[tyrant]]. 

yes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a [[tyrant]].

if the [[people]] yield, well and [[good]]; but if they resist him, as he
began by beating his own [[father]] and [[mother]], so now, if he has the
power, he beats them, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland,
as the cretans say, in subjection to his [[young]] retainers whom he has
introduced to be their rulers and masters. this is the end of his
passions and desires [[desire]]. 

exactly. 
when such [[men]] are only private individuals [[individual]] and before they get [[power]],
this is their [[character]]; they associate entirely with their own flatterers
or ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they in their
turn are equally ready to bow down before them: they profess every
sort of affection for them; but when they have gained their point
they [[know]] them no more. 

yes, truly. 
they are always either the masters or servants and never the friends
of anybody; the [[tyrant]] never tastes of true [[freedom]] or [[friendship]].

certainly not. 
and may we not rightly call such [[men]] [[treacherous]]? 
no [[question]]. 
also they are utterly [[unjust]], if we were [[right]] in our notion of [[justice]]?

yes, he said, and we were perfectly [[right]]. 
let us then sum up in a word, i said, the [[character]] of the worst [[man]]:
he is the waking reality of what we dreamed. 

most true. 
and this is he who being by [[nature]] most of a [[tyrant]] bears [[rule]], and
the longer he lives [[life]] the more of a [[tyrant]] he becomes. 

socrates - glaucon 

that is [[certain]], said glaucon, taking his turn to [[answer]].

and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the
most miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually
and truly miserable; although this may not be the [[opinion]] of [[men]] in
general? 

yes, he said, inevitably. 
and must not the [[tyrannical]] [[man]] be like the [[tyrannical]], [[state]], and
the democratical [[man]] like the democratical [[state]]; and the same of
the others? 

certainly. 
and as [[state]] is to [[state]] in [[virtue]] and [[happiness]], so is [[man]] in relation
to [[man]]? 

to be sure. 
then comparing our original [[city]], which was under a [[king]], and the
city which is under a [[tyrant]], how do they stand as to [[virtue]]?

they are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best
and the other is the very worst. 

there can be no mistake, i said, as to which is which, and therefore
i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision
about their relative [[happiness]] and misery. and here we must not allow
ourselves to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the [[tyrant]], who
is only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but
let us go as we ought into every corner of the [[city]] and look all about,
and then we will give our [[opinion]]. 

a [[fair]] invitation, he replied; and i see, as every one must, that
a [[tyranny]] is the wretchedest form of [[government]], and the [[rule]] of a
king the happiest. 

and in estimating the [[men]] too, may i not fairly make a like request,
that i should have a [[judge]] whose [[mind]] can enter into and see through
human [[nature]]? he must not be like a child who looks at the outside
and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the [[tyrannical]] [[nature]] assumes
to the beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. may i
suppose that the [[judgment]] is given in the hearing of us all by one
who is able to [[judge]], and has dwelt in the same place with him, and
been [[present]] at his dally [[life]] and known him in his [[family]] relations,
where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in
the hour of [[public]] danger --he shall tell us about the [[happiness]] and
misery of the [[tyrant]] when compared with other [[men]]? 

that again, he said, is a very [[fair]] proposal. 
shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges [[judge]] and
have before now met with such a [[person]]? we shall then have some one
who will [[answer]] our enquiries. 

by all means. 
let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the [[individual]] and the
state; bearing this in [[mind]], and glancing in turn from one to the
other of them, will you tell me their respective conditions?

what do you mean? he [[asked]]. 
beginning with the [[state]], i replied, would you say that a [[city]] which
is governed by a [[tyrant]] is [[free]] or enslaved? 

no [[city]], he said, can be more completely enslaved. 
and yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such
a [[state]]? 

yes, he said, i see that there are --a few; but the [[people]], speaking
generally, and the [[best]] of them, are miserably degraded and enslaved.

then if the [[man]] is like the [[state]], i said, must not the same rule
prevail? his [[soul]] is full of meanness and vulgarity --the [[best]] elements
in him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also
the worst and maddest. 

inevitably. 
and would you say that the [[soul]] of such an one is the [[soul]] of a freeman,
or of a [[slave]]? 

he has the [[soul]] of a [[slave]], in my [[opinion]]. 
and the [[state]] which is enslaved under a [[tyrant]] is utterly incapable
of acting voluntarily? 

utterly incapable. 
and also the [[soul]] which is under a [[tyrant]] (i am speaking of the soul
taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires [[desire]]; there
is a gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?

certainly. 
and is the [[city]] which is under a [[tyrant]] [[rich]] or [[poor]]? 
poor. 
and the [[tyrannical]] [[soul]] must be always [[poor]] and insatiable?

true. 
and must not such a [[state]] and such a [[man]] be always full of [[fear]]?

yes, indeed. 
is there any [[state]] in which you will find more of lamentation and
sorrow and groaning and [[pain]]? 

certainly not. 
and is there any [[man]] in whom you will find more of this sort of misery
than in the [[tyrannical]] [[man]], who is in a fury of [[passions]] and desires [[desire]]?

impossible. 
reflecting upon these and similar evils [[evil]], you held the [[tyrannical]] state
to be the most miserable of states? 

and i was [[right]], he said. 
certainly, i said. and when you see the same evils [[evil]] in the tyrannical
man, what do you say of him? 

i say that he is by far the most miserable of all [[men]]. 
there, i said, i [[think]] that you are beginning to go [[wrong]].

what do you mean? 
i do not [[think]] that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery.

then who is more miserable? 
one of whom i am about to speak. 
who is that? 
he who is of a [[tyrannical]] [[nature]], and instead of leading a private
life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public
tyrant. 

from what has been said, i gather that you are [[right]]. 
yes, i replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more
certain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions [[question]], this
respecting [[good]] and [[evil]] is the [[greatest]]. 

very true, he said. 
let me then offer you an illustration, which may, i [[think]], throw a
light upon this [[subject]]. 

what is your illustration? 
the case of [[rich]] individuals [[individual]] in cities [[city]] who possess many slaves [[slave]]: from
them you may form an [[idea]] of the tyrant's condition, for they both
have slaves [[slave]]; the only difference is that he has more slaves [[slave]].

yes, that is the difference. 
you [[know]] that they [[live]] securely and have nothing to apprehend from
their servants? 

what should they [[fear]]? 
nothing. but do you observe the [[reason]] of this? 
yes; the [[reason]] is, that the whole [[city]] is leagued together for the
protection of each [[individual]]. 

very true, i said. but imagine one of these owners, the master say
of some fifty slaves [[slave]], together with his [[family]] and [[property]] and slaves [[slave]],
carried off by a [[god]] into the wilderness, where there are no freemen
to [[help]] him --will he not be in an agony of [[fear]] lest he and his wife
and [[children]] should be put to [[death]] by his slaves [[slave]]? 

yes, he said, he will be in the utmost [[fear]]. 
the [[time]] has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of
his slaves [[slave]], and make many promises to them of [[freedom]] and other things,
much against his will --he will have to cajole his own servants.

yes, he said, that will be the only way of saving himself.

and suppose the same [[god]], who carried him away, to surround him with
neighbours who will not suffer one [[man]] to be the master of another,
and who, if they could catch the offender, would take his [[life]]?

his case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere
surrounded and watched by enemies [[enemy]]. 

and is not this the sort of prison in which the [[tyrant]] will be bound
--he who being by [[nature]] such as we have described, is full of all
sorts of fears [[fear]] and lusts? his [[soul]] is dainty and greedy, and yet alone,
of all [[men]] in the [[city]], he is never allowed to go on a [[journey]], or
to see the things which other freemen [[desire]] to see, but he lives
in his hole like a woman hidden in the house, and is [[jealous]] of any
other citizen who goes into [[foreign]] parts and sees anything of interest.

very true, he said. 
and amid evils [[evil]] such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his
own [[person]] --the [[tyrannical]] [[man]], i mean --whom you just now decided
to be the most miserable of all --will not he be yet more miserable
when, instead of leading a private [[life]], he is constrained by fortune
to be a [[public]] [[tyrant]]? he has to be master of others when he is not
master of himself: he is like a diseased or paralytic [[man]] who is compelled
to pass his [[life]], not in retirement, but fighting and combating with
other [[men]]. 

yes, he said, the similitude is most exact. 
is not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant
lead a worse [[life]] than he whose [[life]] you determined to be the worst?

certainly. 
he who is the real [[tyrant]], whatever [[men]] may [[think]], is the real [[slave]],
and is obliged to practise the [[greatest]] adulation and servility, and
to be the flatterer of the vilest of [[mankind]]. he has desires [[desire]] which
he is utterly unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one,
and is truly [[poor]], if you [[know]] how to inspect the whole [[soul]] of him:
all his [[life]] long he is beset with [[fear]] and is full of convulsions,
and distractions, even as the [[state]] which he resembles: and surely
the resemblance holds? 

very true, he said. 
moreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having [[power]]:
he becomes and is of necessity more [[jealous]], more faithless, more
unjust, more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is
the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of [[vice]], and the consequence
is that he is supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else
as miserable as himself. 

no [[man]] of any sense will dispute your words. 
come then, i said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests
proclaims the result, do you also decide who in your [[opinion]] is first
in the scale of [[happiness]], and who second, and in what order the others
follow: there are five of them in all --they are the [[royal]], timocratical,
oligarchical, democratical, [[tyrannical]]. 

the decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses
coming on the stage, and i must [[judge]] them in the order in which they
enter, by the criterion of [[virtue]] and [[vice]], [[happiness]] and misery.

need we hire a herald, or shall i announce, that the [[son]] of ariston
(the best) has decided that the [[best]] and justest is also the happiest,
and that this is he who is the most [[royal]] [[man]] and [[king]] over himself;
and that the worst and most [[unjust]] [[man]] is also the most miserable,
and that this is he who being the [[greatest]] [[tyrant]] of himself is also
the [[greatest]] [[tyrant]] of his [[state]]? 

make the proclamation yourself, he said. 
and shall i add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and men'?

let the words be added. 
then this, i said, will be our first proof; and there is another,
which may also have some weight. 

what is that? 
the second proof is derived from the [[nature]] of the [[soul]]: seeing that
the [[individual]] [[soul]], like the [[state]], has been divided by us into three
principles, the division may, i [[think]], furnish a new demonstration.

of what [[nature]]? 
it seems to me that to these three principles [[principle]] three pleasures [[pleasure]] correspond;
also three desires [[desire]] and governing powers [[power]]. 

how do you mean? he said. 
there is one [[principle]] with which, as we were saying, a [[man]] learns,
another with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has
no special name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from
the extraordinary [[strength]] and vehemence of the desires [[desire]] of eating
and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements
of it; also money-loving, because such desires [[desire]] are generally satisfied
by the [[help]] of [[money]]. 

that is true, he said. 
if we were to say that the loves [[love]] and pleasures [[pleasure]] of this third part
were concerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a
single notion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part
of the [[soul]] as loving gain or [[money]]. 

i agree with you. 
again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering
and getting fame? 

true. 
suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious --would the term be
suitable? 

extremely suitable. 
on the other hand, every one sees that the [[principle]] of knowledge
is wholly directed to the [[truth]], and cares [[care]] less than either of the
others for gain or fame. 

far less. 
'lover of [[wisdom]],' 'lover of [[knowledge]],' are titles which we may fitly
apply to that part of the [[soul]]? 

certainly. 
one [[principle]] prevails in the souls [[soul]] of one class of [[men]], another in
others, as may happen? 

yes. 
then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men
--lovers of [[wisdom]], lovers of [[honour]], lovers of gain? 

exactly. 
and there are three kinds [[kind]] of [[pleasure]], which are their several objects?

very true. 
now, if you examine the three classes of [[men]], and ask of them in turn
which of their lives [[life]] is pleasantest, each will be found praising his
own and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast
the vanity of [[honour]] or of learning if they bring no [[money]] with the
solid advantages of gold and silver? 

true, he said. 
and the lover of [[honour]] --what will be his [[opinion]]? will he not think
that the [[pleasure]] of riches [[rich]] is vulgar, while the [[pleasure]] of learning,
if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?

very true. 
and are we to suppose, i said, that the philosopher sets any value
on other pleasures [[pleasure]] in comparison with the [[pleasure]] of knowing the
truth, and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed
from the [[heaven]] of [[pleasure]]? does he not call the other pleasures
necessary, under the [[idea]] that if there were no necessity for them,
he would rather not have them? 

there can be no [[doubt]] of that, he replied. 
since, then, the pleasures [[pleasure]] of each class and the [[life]] of each are
in dispute, and the [[question]] is not which [[life]] is more or less honourable,
or [[better]] or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless --how
shall we [[know]] who speaks truly? 

i cannot myself tell, he said. 
well, but what ought to be the criterion? is any [[better]] than experience
and [[wisdom]] and [[reason]]? 

there cannot be a [[better]], he said. 
then, i said, reflect. of the three individuals [[individual]], which has the greatest
experience of all the pleasures [[pleasure]] which we enumerated? has the lover
of gain, in learning the [[nature]] of essential [[truth]], greater experience
of the [[pleasure]] of [[knowledge]] than the philosopher has of the pleasure
of gain? 

the philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has
of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures [[pleasure]] from his
childhood upwards: but the lover of gain in all his [[experience]] has
not of necessity tasted --or, i should rather say, even had he [[desired]],
could hardly have tasted --the sweetness of learning and knowing [[truth]].

then the lover of [[wisdom]] has a [[great]] advantage over the lover of gain,
for he has a double [[experience]]? 

yes, very [[great]]. 
again, has he greater [[experience]] of the pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[honour]], or the
lover of [[honour]] of the pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[wisdom]]? 

nay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain
their object; for the [[rich]] [[man]] and the brave [[man]] and the [[wise]] man
alike have their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour
they all have [[experience]] of the pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[honour]]; but the delight
which is to be found in the [[knowledge]] of true being is known to the
philosopher only. 

his [[experience]], then, will enable him to [[judge]] [[better]] than any one?

far [[better]]. 
and he is the only one who has [[wisdom]] as well as [[experience]]?

certainly. 
further, the very faculty which is the instrument of [[judgment]] is not
possessed by the covetous or ambitious [[man]], but only by the philosopher?

what faculty? 
reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.

yes. 
and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument? 
certainly. 
if [[wealth]] and gain were the criterion, then the [[praise]] or blame of
the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy? 

assuredly. 
or if [[honour]] or [[victory]] or [[courage]], in that case the judgement of
the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest? 

clearly. 
but since [[experience]] and [[wisdom]] and [[reason]] are the judges--

the only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures [[pleasure]] which are
approved by the lover of [[wisdom]] and [[reason]] are the truest.

and so we arrive at the result, that the [[pleasure]] of the intelligent
part of the [[soul]] is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us
in whom this is the ruling [[principle]] has the pleasantest [[life]].

unquestionably, he said, the [[wise]] [[man]] speaks with [[authority]] when he
approves of his own [[life]]. 

and what does the [[judge]] affirm to be the [[life]] which is next, and the
pleasure which is next? 

clearly that of the soldier and lover of [[honour]]; who is nearer to
himself than the money-maker. 

last comes the lover of gain? 
very true, he said. 
twice in succession, then, has the just [[man]] overthrown the unjust
in this conflict; and now comes the third [[trial]], which is dedicated
to olympian [[zeus]] the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure
except that of the [[wise]] is quite true and pure --all others are a
shadow only; and surely this will prove the [[greatest]] and most decisive
of falls? 

yes, the [[greatest]]; but will you explain yourself? 
i will [[work]] out the [[subject]] and you shall [[answer]] my questions [[question]].

proceed. 
say, then, is not [[pleasure]] opposed to [[pain]]? 
true. 
and there is a neutral [[state]] which is neither [[pleasure]] nor [[pain]]?

there is. 
a [[state]] which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the [[soul]] about
either --that is what you mean? 

yes. 
you [[remember]] what [[people]] say when they are sick? 
what do they say? 
that after all nothing is pleasanter than health. but then they never
knew this to be the [[greatest]] of pleasures [[pleasure]] until they were ill.

yes, i [[know]], he said. 
and when persons [[person]] are suffering from acute [[pain]], you must. have heard
them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their
pain? 

i have. 
and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest
and cessation of [[pain]], and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled
by them as the [[greatest]] [[pleasure]]? 

yes, he said; at the [[time]] they are pleased and well content to be
at rest. 

again, when [[pleasure]] ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be
painful? 

doubtless, he said. 
then the intermediate [[state]] of rest will be [[pleasure]] and will also
be [[pain]]? 

so it would seem. 
but can that which is neither become both? 
i should say not. 
and both [[pleasure]] and [[pain]] are motions of the [[soul]], are they not?

yes. 
but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,
and in a mean between them? 

yes. 
how, then, can we be [[right]] in supposing that the absence of [[pain]] is
pleasure, or that the absence of [[pleasure]] is [[pain]]? 

impossible. 
this then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is tc say,
the rest is [[pleasure]] at the moment and in comparison of what is painful,
and painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these representations,
when tried by the test of true [[pleasure]], are not real but a sort of
imposition? 

that is the inference. 
look at the other class of pleasures [[pleasure]] which have no antecedent pains
and you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at [[present]], that
pleasure is only the cessation of [[pain]], or [[pain]] of [[pleasure]].

what are they, he said, and where shall i find them? 
there are many of them: take as an [[example]] the pleasures [[pleasure]], of smell,
which are very [[great]] and have no antecedent pains [[pain]]; they come in a
moment, and when they depart leave no [[pain]] behind them. 

most true, he said. 
let us not, then, be induced to [[believe]] that pure [[pleasure]] is the
cessation of [[pain]], or [[pain]] of [[pleasure]]. 

no. 
still, the more numerous and [[violent]] pleasures [[pleasure]] which reach the soul
through the [[body]] are generally of this sort --they are reliefs of
pain. 

that is true. 
and the anticipations of future pleasures [[pleasure]] and pains [[pain]] are of a like
nature? 

yes. 
shall i give you an illustration of them? 
let me hear. 
you would allow, i said, that there is in [[nature]] an upper and lower
and middle region? 

i should. 
and if a [[person]] were to go from the lower to the middle region, would
he not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the
middle and sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already
in the upper region, if he has never seen the true upper [[world]]?

to be sure, he said; how can he [[think]] otherwise? 
but if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine,
that he was descending? 

no [[doubt]]. 
all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle
and lower regions? 

yes. 
then can you wonder that persons [[person]] who are inexperienced in the [[truth]],
as they have [[wrong]] ideas [[idea]] about many other things, should also have
wrong ideas [[idea]] about [[pleasure]] and [[pain]] and the intermediate [[state]]; so
that when they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel
pain and [[think]] the [[pain]] which they [[experience]] to be real, and in like
manner, when drawn away from [[pain]] to the neutral or intermediate [[state]],
they firmly [[believe]] that they have reached the goal of satiety and
pleasure; they, not knowing [[pleasure]], err in contrasting [[pain]] with
the absence of [[pain]]. which is like contrasting black with grey instead
of [[white]] --can you wonder, i say, at this? 

no, indeed; i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.

look at the matter thus: --hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions
of the bodily [[state]]? 

yes. 
and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the [[soul]]? 
true. 
and food and [[wisdom]] are the corresponding satisfactions of either?

certainly. 
and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that
which has more existence the truer? 

clearly, from that which has more. 
what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your
judgment --those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds
of sustenance are examples [[example]], or the class which contains true opinion
and [[knowledge]] and [[mind]] and all the different kinds [[kind]] of [[virtue]]? put
the [[question]] in this way: --which has a more pure being --that which
is concerned with the invariable, the [[immortal]], and the true, and
is of such a [[nature]], and is found in such natures [[nature]]; or that which is
concerned with and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself
variable and mortal? 

far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with
the invariable. 

and does the essence of the invariable partake of [[knowledge]] in the
same [[degree]] as of essence? 

yes, of [[knowledge]] in the same [[degree]]. 
and of [[truth]] in the same [[degree]]? 
yes. 
and, conversely, that which has less of [[truth]] will also have less
of essence? 

necessarily. 
then, in general, those kinds [[kind]] of things which are in the service of
the [[body]] have less of [[truth]] and essence than those which are in the
service of the [[soul]]? 

far less. 
and has not the [[body]] itself less of [[truth]] and essence than the [[soul]]?

yes. 
what is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real
existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less
real existence and is less real? 

of course. 
and if there be a [[pleasure]] in being filled with that which is according
to [[nature]], that which is more really filled with more real being will
more really and truly enjoy true [[pleasure]]; whereas that which participates
in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied, and will
participate in an illusory and less real [[pleasure]]? 

unquestionably. 
those then who [[know]] not [[wisdom]] and [[virtue]], and are always busy with
gluttony and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean;
and in this region they move at random throughout [[life]], but they never
pass into the true upper [[world]]; thither they neither look, nor do
they ever find their way, neither are they truly filled with true
being, nor do they taste of pure and abiding [[pleasure]]. like cattle,
with their [[eyes]] always looking down and their heads stooping to the
earth, that is, to the dining-table, they fatten and feed and breed,
and, in their excessive [[love]] of these delights, they kick and butt
at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron; and they
kill one another by [[reason]] of their insatiable [[lust]]. for they fill
themselves with that which is not substantial, and the part of themselves
which they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent. 

verily, [[socrates]], said glaucon, you describe the [[life]] of the many
like an oracle. 

their pleasures [[pleasure]] are mixed with pains [[pain]] --how can they be otherwise?
for they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured
by contrast, which exaggerates both [[light]] and shade, and so they implant
in the minds [[mind]] of fools [[fool]] insane desires [[desire]] of themselves; and they are fought
about as stesichorus says that the greeks [[greek]] fought about the shadow
of helen at troy in ignorance of the [[truth]]. 

something of that sort must inevitably happen. 
and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element
of the [[soul]]? will not the passionate [[man]] who carries his passion into
action, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious,
or [[violent]] and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking
to attain [[honour]] and [[victory]] and the satisfaction of his anger without
reason or sense? 

yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.

then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of [[money]] and [[honour]],
when they seek their pleasures [[pleasure]] under the guidance and in the company
of [[reason]] and [[knowledge]], and pursue after and [[win]] the pleasures [[pleasure]] which
wisdom shows them, will also have the truest pleasures [[pleasure]] in the highest
degree which is attainable to them, inasmuch as they [[follow]] [[truth]];
and they will have the pleasures [[pleasure]] which are [[natural]] to them, if that
which is [[best]] for each one is also most [[natural]] to him? 

yes, certainly; the [[best]] is the most [[natural]]. 
and when the whole [[soul]] follows the philosophical [[principle]], and there
is no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their
own [[business]], and enjoy severally the [[best]] and truest pleasures [[pleasure]] of
which they are capable? 

exactly. 
but when either of the two other principles [[principle]] prevails, it fails in
attaining its own [[pleasure]], and compels the rest to pursue after a
pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?

true. 
and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy
and [[reason]], the more [[strange]] and illusive will be the [[pleasure]]?

yes. 
and is not that farthest from [[reason]] which is at the [[greatest]] distance
from [[law]] and order? 

clearly. 
and the lustful and [[tyrannical]] desires [[desire]] are, as we saw, at the greatest
distance? yes. 

and the [[royal]] and orderly desires [[desire]] are nearest? 
yes. 
then the [[tyrant]] will [[live]] at the [[greatest]] distance from true or natural
pleasure, and the [[king]] at the least? 

certainly. 
but if so, the [[tyrant]] will [[live]] most unpleasantly, and the [[king]] most
pleasantly? 

inevitably. 
would you [[know]] the measure of the interval which separates them?

will you tell me? 
there appear to be three pleasures [[pleasure]], one [[genuine]] and two spurious:
now the transgression of the [[tyrant]] reaches a point beyond the spurious;
he has run away from the region of [[law]] and [[reason]], and taken up his
abode with [[certain]] [[slave]] pleasures [[pleasure]] which are his satellites, and the
measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.

how do you mean? 
i assume, i said, that the [[tyrant]] is in the third place from the oligarch;
the democrat was in the middle? 

yes. 
and if there is [[truth]] in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an
image of [[pleasure]] which is thrice removed as to [[truth]] from the pleasure
of the oligarch? 

he will. 
and the oligarch is third from the [[royal]]; since we count as one royal
and aristocratical? 

yes, he is third. 
then the [[tyrant]] is removed from true [[pleasure]] by the space of a number
which is three times [[time]] three? 

manifestly. 
the shadow then of [[tyrannical]] [[pleasure]] determined by the number of
length will be a plane figure. 

certainly. 
and if you raise the [[power]] and make the plane a solid, there is no
difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant
is parted from the [[king]]. 

yes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum. 
or if some [[person]] begins at the other end and measures the interval
by which the [[king]] is parted from the [[tyrant]] in [[truth]] of [[pleasure]],
he will find him, when the multiplication is complete, living 729
times more pleasantly, and the [[tyrant]] more painfully by this same
interval. 

what a wonderful calculation! and how enormous is the distance which
separates the just from the [[unjust]] in regard to [[pleasure]] and pain!

yet a true calculation, i said, and a number which nearly concerns
human [[life]], if [[human]] beings are concerned with days and nights and
months and years. 

yes, he said, [[human]] [[life]] is certainly concerned with them.

then if the [[good]] and just [[man]] be thus superior in [[pleasure]] to the
evil and [[unjust]], his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety
of [[life]] and in [[beauty]] and [[virtue]]? 

immeasurably greater. 
well, i said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument,
we may revert to the words which brought us hither: was not some one
saying that [[injustice]] was a gain to the perfectly [[unjust]] who was reputed
to be just? 

yes, that was said. 
now then, having determined the [[power]] and quality of [[justice]] and [[injustice]],
let us have a little conversation with him. 

what shall we say to him? 
let us make an image of the [[soul]], that he may have his own words presented
before his [[eyes]]. 

of what sort? 
an ideal image of the [[soul]], like the composite creations of ancient
mythology, such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus, and there are
many others in which two or more different natures [[nature]] are said to grow
into one. 

there are said of have been such unions. 
then do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster,
having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which
he is able to generate and metamorphose at will. 

you suppose marvellous powers [[power]] in the artist; but, as [[language]] is more
pliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model
as you propose. 

suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third
of a [[man]], the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller
than the second. 

that, he said, is an easier task; and i have made them as you say.

and now join them, and let the three grow into one. 
that has been accomplished. 
next [[fashion]] the outside of them into a [[single]] image, as of a [[man]],
so that he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer
hull, may [[believe]] the beast to be a [[single]] [[human]] creature. i have
done so, he said. 

and now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human
creature to be [[unjust]], and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that,
if he be [[right]], it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous
monster and strengthen the lion and the lion-like qualities, but to
starve and weaken the [[man]], who is consequently liable to be dragged
about at the [[mercy]] of either of the other two; and he is not to attempt
to familiarize or harmonize them with one another --he ought rather
to suffer them to [[fight]] and bite and devour one another.

certainly, he said; that is what the approver of [[injustice]] says.

to him the supporter of [[justice]] makes [[answer]] that he should ever so
speak and act as to give the [[man]] within him in some way or other the
most complete mastery over the entire [[human]] creature. 

he should watch over the many-headed monster like a [[good]] husbandman,
fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the
wild ones from growing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally,
and in [[common]] [[care]] of them all should be uniting the several parts
with one another and with himself. 

yes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of [[justice]] say.

and so from every point of view, whether of [[pleasure]], [[honour]], or advantage,
the approver of [[justice]] is [[right]] and speaks the [[truth]], and the disapprover
is [[wrong]] and false and ignorant. 

yes, from every point of view. 
come, now, and let us gently [[reason]] with the [[unjust]], who is not intentionally
in error. 'sweet sir,' we will say to him, what [[think]] you of things
esteemed [[noble]] and ignoble? is not the [[noble]] that which subjects [[subject]] the
beast to the [[man]], or rather to the [[god]] in [[man]]; and the ignoble that
which subjects [[subject]] the [[man]] to the beast?' he can hardly avoid saying yes
--can he now? 

not if he has any regard for my [[opinion]]. 
but, if he agree so far, we may ask him to [[answer]] another [[question]]:
'then how would a [[man]] [[profit]] if he received gold and silver on the
condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst?
who can imagine that a [[man]] who sold his [[son]] or [[daughter]] into slavery
for [[money]], especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and
evil [[men]], would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which
he received? and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff
who remorselessly sells his own [[divine]] being to that which is most
godless and detestable? eriphyle took the necklace as the price of
her husband's [[life]], but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a
worse ruin.' 

yes, said glaucon, far worse --i will [[answer]] for him. 
has not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge
multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large? 

clearly. 
and [[men]] are blamed for [[pride]] and [[bad]] temper when the lion and serpent
element in them disproportionately grows and gains [[strength]]?

yes. 
and luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken
this same creature, and make a [[coward]] of him? 

very true. 
and is not a [[man]] reproached for [[flattery]] and meanness who subordinates
the spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of [[money]],
of which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his
youth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become
a monkey? 

true, he said. 
and why are mean employments and manual [[arts]] a reproach only because
they imply a [[natural]] weakness of the higher [[principle]]; the individual
is unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them,
and his [[great]] study is how to flatter them. 

such appears to be the [[reason]]. 
and therefore, being desirous of placing him under a [[rule]] like that
of the [[best]], we say that he ought to be the servant of the [[best]], in
whom the [[divine]] rules [[rule]]; not, as thrasymachus supposed, to the injury
of the servant, but because every one had [[better]] be ruled by divine
wisdom dwelling within him; or, if this be impossible, then by an
external [[authority]], in order that we may be all, as far as possible,
under the same [[government]], [[friends]] and equals [[equal]]. 

true, he said. 
and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the [[law]], which is
the ally of the whole [[city]]; and is seen also in the [[authority]] which
we exercise over [[children]], and the refusal to let them be [[free]] until
we have established in them a [[principle]] analogous to the constitution
of a [[state]], and by cultivation of this higher element have set up
in their hearts [[heart]] a guardian and ruler like our own, and when this is
done they may go their ways. 

yes, he said, the [[purpose]] of the [[law]] is manifest. 
from what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that
a [[man]] is profited by [[injustice]] or intemperance or other baseness,
which will make him a worse [[man]], even though he acquire [[money]] or power
by his wickedness? 

from no point of view at all. 
what shall he [[profit]], if his [[injustice]] be undetected and unpunished?
he who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and
punished has the brutal part of his [[nature]] silenced and humanized;
the gentler element in him is liberated, and his whole [[soul]] is perfected
and ennobled by the acquirement of [[justice]] and temperance and [[wisdom]],
more than the [[body]] ever is by receiving gifts of [[beauty]], strength
and health, in proportion as the [[soul]] is more honourable than the
body. 

certainly, he said. 
to this nobler [[purpose]] the [[man]] of understanding will devote the energies
of his [[life]]. and in the first place, he will [[honour]] studies which
impress these qualities on his [[soul]] and disregard others?

clearly, he said. 
in the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training,
and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures [[pleasure]],
that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first
object will be not that he may be [[fair]] or [[strong]] or well, unless he
is likely thereby to gain temperance, but he will always [[desire]] so
to attemper the [[body]] as to preserve the harmony of the [[soul]]?

certainly he will, if he has true [[music]] in him. 
and in the acquisition of [[wealth]] there is a [[principle]] of order and
harmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be
dazzled by the foolish applause of the [[world]], and heap up riches [[rich]] to
his own infinite harm? 

certainly not, he said. 
he will look at the [[city]] which is within him, and take heed that no
disorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity
or from want; and upon this [[principle]] he will regulate his property
and gain or spend according to his means. 

very true. 
and, for the same [[reason]], he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours
as he deems likely to make him a [[better]] [[man]]; but those, whether private
or [[public]], which are likely to disorder his [[life]], he will avoid?

then, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.

by the dog of [[egypt]], he will! in the [[city]] which 's his own he certainly
will, though in the [[land]] of his birth perhaps not, unless he have
a [[divine]] call. 

i [[understand]]; you mean that he will be a ruler in the [[city]] of which
we are the founders, and which exists in [[idea]] only; for i do not believe
that there is such an one anywhere on [[earth]]? 

in [[heaven]], i replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks,
which he who desires [[desire]] may behold, and beholding, may set his own house
in order. but whether such an one exists, or ever will [[exist]] in [[fact]],
is no matter; for he will [[live]] after the manner of that [[city]], having
nothing to do with any other. 

i [[think]] so, he said. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book x

socrates - glaucon 

of he many excellences which i perceive in the order of our [[state]],
there is none which upon reflection pleases me [[better]] than the rule
about poetry. 

to what do you refer? 
to the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to
be received; as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul
have been distinguished. 

what do you mean? 
speaking in confidence, for i should not like to have my words repeated
to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe --but i do not
mind saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the
understanding of the hearers, and that the [[knowledge]] of their true
nature is the only antidote to them. 

explain the purport of your remark. 
well, i will tell you, although i have always from my earliest youth
had an awe and [[love]] of [[homer]], which even now makes the words falter
on my lips, for he is the [[great]] captain and teacher of the whole of
that charming tragic company; but a [[man]] is not to be reverenced more
than the [[truth]], and therefore i will speak out. 

very [[good]], he said. 
listen to me then, or rather, [[answer]] me. 
put your [[question]]. 
can you tell me what imitation is? for i really do not [[know]].

a likely thing, then, that i should [[know]]. 
why not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the
keener. 

very true, he said; but in your presence, even if i had any faint
notion, i could not muster [[courage]] to utter it. will you enquire yourself?

well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: whenever
a number of individuals [[individual]] have a [[common]] name, we assume them to have
also a corresponding [[idea]] or form. do you [[understand]] me?

i do. 
let us take any [[common]] instance; there are beds and tables in the
world --plenty of them, are there not? 

yes. 
but there are only two ideas [[idea]] or forms of them --one the [[idea]] of a
bed, the other of a table. 

true. 
and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for
our use, in accordance with the [[idea]] --that is our way of speaking
in this and similar instances --but no artificer makes the ideas [[idea]] themselves:
how could he? 

impossible. 
and there is another artist, --i should like to [[know]] what you would
say of him. 

who is he? 
one who is the maker of all the works [[work]] of all other workmen.

what an extraordinary man! 
wait a little, and there will be more [[reason]] for your saying so. for
this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every [[kind]], but
plants and animals, himself and all other things --the [[earth]] and [[heaven]],
and the things which are in [[heaven]] or under the [[earth]]; he makes the
gods also. 

he must be a wizard and no mistake. 
oh! you are incredulous, are you? do you mean that there is no such
maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all
these things but in another not? do you see that there is a way in
which you could make them all yourself? 

what way? 
an easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat
might be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of
turning a mirror round and round --you would soon enough make the
sun and the heavens [[heaven]], and the [[earth]] and yourself, and other animals
and plants, and all the, other things of which we were just now speaking,
in the mirror. 

yes, he said; but they would be appearances only. 
very [[good]], i said, you are coming to the point now. and the painter
too is, as i conceive, just such another --a creator of appearances,
is he not? 

of course. 
but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. and
yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?

yes, he said, but not a real bed. 
and what of the maker of the bed? were you not saying that he too
makes, not the [[idea]] which, according to our view, is the essence of
the bed, but only a particular bed? 

yes, i did. 
then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence,
but only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to say that
the [[work]] of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has real
existence, he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the [[truth]].

at any rate, he replied, [[philosophers]] would say that he was not speaking
the [[truth]]. 

no wonder, then, that his [[work]] too is an indistinct expression of
truth. 

no wonder. 
suppose now that by the [[light]] of the examples [[example]] just offered we enquire
who this imitator is? 

if you please. 
well then, here are three beds: one existing in [[nature]], which is made
by [[god]], as i [[think]] that we may say --for no one else can be the maker?

no. 
there is another which is the [[work]] of the carpenter? 
yes. 
and the [[work]] of the painter is a third? 
yes. 
beds, then, are of three kinds [[kind]], and there are three artists who superintend
them: [[god]], the maker of the bed, and the painter? 

yes, there are three of them. 
god, whether from [[choice]] or from necessity, made one bed in nature
and one only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor
ever will be made by [[god]]. 

why is that? 
because even if he had made but two, a third would still appear behind
them which both of them would have for their [[idea]], and that would
be the ideal bed and the two others. 

very true, he said. 
god knew this, and he [[desired]] to be the real maker of a real bed,
not a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore he created
a bed which is essentially and by [[nature]] one only. 

so we [[believe]]. 
shall we, then, speak of him as the [[natural]] author or maker of the
bed? 

yes, he replied; inasmuch as by the [[natural]] process of creation he
is the author of this and of all other things. 

and what shall we say of the carpenter --is not he also the maker
of the bed? 

yes. 
but would you call the painter a creator and maker? 
certainly not. 
yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?

i [[think]], he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator
of that which the others make. 

good, i said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature
an imitator? 

certainly, he said. 
and the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other
imitators, he is thrice removed from the [[king]] and from the [[truth]]?

that appears to be so. 
then about the imitator we are agreed. and what about the painter?
--i would like to [[know]] whether he may be [[thought]] to imitate that which
originally exists in [[nature]], or only the creations of artists?

the latter. 
as they are or as they appear? you have still to determine this.

what do you mean? 
i mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view,
obliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed
will appear different, but there is no difference in reality. and
the same of all things. 

yes, he said, the difference is only apparent. 
now let me ask you another [[question]]: which is the art [[arts]] of painting
designed to be --an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear
--of appearance or of reality? 

of appearance. 
then the imitator, i said, is a long way off the [[truth]], and can do
all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and
that part an image. for [[example]]: a painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter,
or any other artist, though he knows [[know]] nothing of their [[arts]]; and, if
he is a [[good]] artist, he may [[deceive]] [[children]] or simple persons [[person]], when
he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they
will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter. 

certainly. 
and whenever any one informs us that he has found a [[man]] knows [[know]] all
the [[arts]], and all things else that anybody knows [[know]], and every single
thing with a higher [[degree]] of accuracy than any other [[man]] --whoever
tells us this, i [[think]] that we can only imagine to be a simple creature
who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he
met, and whom he [[thought]] all-knowing, because he himself was unable
to analyse the [[nature]] of [[knowledge]] and ignorance and imitation.

most true. 
and so, when we hear persons [[person]] saying that the tragedians, and [[homer]],
who is at their head, [[know]] all the [[arts]] and all things [[human]], virtue
as well as [[vice]], and [[divine]] things too, for that the [[good]] poet cannot
compose well unless he knows [[know]] his [[subject]], and that he who has not
this [[knowledge]] can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here
also there may not be a similar illusion. perhaps they may have come
across imitators and been deceived by them; they may not have remembered
when they saw their works [[work]] that these were but imitations thrice removed
from the [[truth]], and could easily be made without any [[knowledge]] of
the [[truth]], because they are appearances only and not realities? or,
after all, they may be in the [[right]], and poets do really [[know]] the
things about which they seem to the many to speak so well?

the [[question]], he said, should by all means be considered.

now do you suppose that if a [[person]] were able to make the original
as well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making
branch? would he allow imitation to be the ruling [[principle]] of his
life, as if he had nothing higher in him? 

i should say not. 
the real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested
in realities and not in imitations; and would [[desire]] to leave as memorials
of himself works [[work]] many and [[fair]]; and, instead of being the author of
encomiums, he would prefer to be the theme of them. 

yes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour
and [[profit]]. 

then, i said, we must put a [[question]] to [[homer]]; not about medicine,
or any of the [[arts]] to which his poems only incidentally refer: we
are not going to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured
patients like asclepius, or left behind him a school of medicine such
as the asclepiads were, or whether he only talks about medicine and
other [[arts]] at second hand; but we have a [[right]] to [[know]] respecting
military tactics, [[politics]], [[education]], which are the chiefest and
noblest subjects [[subject]] of his poems, and we may fairly ask him about them.
'friend [[homer]],' then we say to him, 'if you are only in the second
remove from [[truth]] in what you say of [[virtue]], and not in the third
--not an image maker or imitator --and if you are able to discern
what pursuits make [[men]] [[better]] or worse in private or [[public]] [[life]],
tell us what [[state]] was ever [[better]] governed by your [[help]]? the good
order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgus, and many other cities [[city]] great
and small have been similarly benefited by others; but who says that
you have been a [[good]] legislator to them and have done them any [[good]]?
italy and sicily boast of charondas, and there is solon who is renowned
among us; but what [[city]] has anything to say about you?' is there any
city which he might name? 

i [[think]] not, said glaucon; not even the homerids themselves pretend
that he was a legislator. 

well, but is there any [[war]] on record which was carried on successfully
by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive? 

there is not. 
or is there any invention of his, applicable to the [[arts]] or to human
life, such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian, and
other ingenious [[men]] have conceived, which is attributed to him?

there is absolutely nothing of the [[kind]]. 
but, if [[homer]] never did any [[public]] service, was he privately a guide
or teacher of any? had he in his lifetime [[friends]] who loved to associate
with him, and who handed down to [[posterity]] an homeric way of [[life]],
such as was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for
his [[wisdom]], and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for
the order which was named after him? 

nothing of the [[kind]] is recorded of him. for surely, [[socrates]], creophylus,
the companion of [[homer]], that child of flesh, whose name always makes
us laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity, if, as
is said, [[homer]] was greatly neglected by him and others in his own
day when he was alive? 

yes, i replied, that is the tradition. but can you imagine, glaucon,
that if [[homer]] had really been able to educate and improve mankind
--if he had possessed [[knowledge]] and not been a mere imitator --can
you imagine, i say, that he would not have had many followers, and
been honoured and loved by them? protagoras of abdera, and prodicus
of ceos, and a host of others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries:
'you will never be able to manage either your own house or your own
state until you appoint us to be your ministers of education' --and
this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making them
love them that their companions all but carry them about on their
shoulders. and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of [[homer]],
or again of hesiod, would have allowed either of them to go about
as rhapsodists, if they had really been able to make [[mankind]] [[virtuous]]?
would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold,
and have compelled them to stay at [[home]] with them? or, if the master
would not stay, then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere,
until they had got [[education]] enough? 

yes, [[socrates]], that, i [[think]], is quite true. 
then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals [[individual]], beginning
with [[homer]], are only imitators; they copy images of [[virtue]] and the
like, but the [[truth]] they never reach? the poet is like a painter who,
as we have already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though
he understands nothing of cobbling; and his picture is [[good]] enough
for those who [[know]] no more than he does, and [[judge]] only by colours
and figures. 

quite so. 
in like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to
lay on the colours of the several [[arts]], himself understanding their
nature only enough to imitate them; and other [[people]], who are as ignorant
as he is, and [[judge]] only from his words, imagine that if he speaks
of cobbling, or of [[military]] tactics, or of anything else, in metre
and harmony and rhythm, he speaks very well --such is the sweet influence
which melody and rhythm by [[nature]] have. and i [[think]] that you must
have observed again and again what a [[poor]] appearance the tales of
poets make when stripped of the colours which [[music]] puts upon them,
and recited in simple prose. 

yes, he said. 
they are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only blooming;
and now the bloom of [[youth]] has passed away from them? 

exactly. 
here is another point: the imitator or maker of the image knows [[know]] nothing
of true existence; he knows [[know]] appearances only. am i not [[right]]?

yes. 
then let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with
half an explanation. 

proceed. 
of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint
a bit? 

yes. 
and the worker in leather and brass will make them? 
certainly. 
but does the painter [[know]] the [[right]] form of the bit and reins? nay,
hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the
horseman who knows [[know]] how to use them --he knows [[know]] their [[right]] form.

most true. 
and may we not say the same of all things? 
what? 
that there are three [[arts]] which are concerned with all things: one
which uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?

yes. 
and the excellence or [[beauty]] or [[truth]] of every structure, animate
or inanimate, and of every action of [[man]], is relative to the use for
which [[nature]] or the artist has intended them. 

true. 
then the user of them must have the [[greatest]] [[experience]] of them, and
he must indicate to the maker the [[good]] or [[bad]] qualities which develop
themselves in use; for [[example]], the flute-player will tell the flute-maker
which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he will tell
him how he ought to make them, and the other will attend to his instructions?

of course. 
the one knows [[know]] and therefore speaks with [[authority]] about the goodness
and badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do
what he is told by him? 

true. 
the instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of
it the maker will only attain to a [[correct]] [[belief]]; and this he will
gain from him who knows [[know]], by talking to him and being compelled to
hear what he has to say, whereas the user will have [[knowledge]]?

true. 
but will the imitator have either? will he [[know]] from use whether or
no his drawing is [[correct]] or beautiful? or will he have [[right]] opinion
from being compelled to associate with another who knows [[know]] and gives
him instructions about what he should draw? 

neither. 
then he will no more have true [[opinion]] than he will have knowledge
about the goodness or badness of his imitations? 

i suppose not. 
the imitative artist will be in a brilliant [[state]] of intelligence
about his own creations? 

nay, very much the reverse. 
and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing
good or [[bad]], and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which
appears to be [[good]] to the ignorant multitude? 

just so. 
thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge
worth mentioning of what he imitates. imitation is only a [[kind]] of
play or [[sport]], and the tragic poets, whether they write in iambic
or in heroic verse, are imitators in the highest [[degree]]?

very true. 
and now tell me, i conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us
to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the [[truth]]?

certainly. 
and what is the faculty in [[man]] to which imitation is addressed?

what do you mean? 
i will explain: the [[body]] which is large when seen near, appears small
when seen at a distance? 

true. 
and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water,
and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing
to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. thus every
sort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness
of the [[human]] [[mind]] on which the art [[arts]] of conjuring and of deceiving by
light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect
upon us like magic. 

true. 
and the [[arts]] of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue
of the [[human]] understanding-there is the [[beauty]] of them --and the apparent
greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over
us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?

most true. 
and this, surely, must be the [[work]] of the calculating and rational
principle in the [[soul]] 

to be sure. 
and when this [[principle]] measures and certifies that some things are
equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs
an apparent contradiction? 

true. 
but were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty
cannot have contrary opinions [[opinion]] at the same [[time]] about the same thing?

very true. 
then that part of the [[soul]] which has an [[opinion]] contrary to measure
is not the same with that which has an [[opinion]] in accordance with
measure? 

true. 
and the [[better]] part of the [[soul]] is likely to be that which trusts
to measure and calculation? 

certainly. 
and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles
of the [[soul]]? 

no [[doubt]]. 
this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said
that painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their
own proper [[work]], are far removed from [[truth]], and the companions and
friends and associates of a [[principle]] within us which is equally removed
from [[reason]], and that they have no true or healthy aim. 

exactly. 
the imitative art [[arts]] is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has
inferior offspring. 

very true. 
and is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing
also, relating in [[fact]] to what we term poetry? 

probably the same would be true of poetry. 
do not rely, i said, on a probability derived from the analogy of
painting; but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with
which poetical imitation is concerned is [[good]] or [[bad]]. 

by all means. 
we may [[state]] the [[question]] thus: --imitation imitates the actions of
men, whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine,
a [[good]] or [[bad]] result has ensued, and they rejoice or [[sorrow]] accordingly.
is there anything more? 

no, there is nothing else. 
but in all this variety of circumstances is the [[man]] at unity with
himself --or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion
and opposition in his opinions [[opinion]] about the same things, so here also
is there not strife and inconsistency in his [[life]]? though i need hardly
raise the [[question]] again, for i [[remember]] that all this has been already
admitted; and the [[soul]] has been acknowledged by us to be full of these
and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?

and we were [[right]], he said. 
yes, i said, thus far we were [[right]]; but there was an omission which
must now be supplied. 

what was the omission? 
were we not saying that a [[good]] [[man]], who has the misfortune to lose
his [[son]] or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the
loss with more equanimity than another? 

yes. 
but will he have no [[sorrow]], or shall we say that although he cannot
help sorrowing, he will moderate his [[sorrow]]? 

the latter, he said, is the truer statement. 
tell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his
sorrow when he is seen by his equals [[equal]], or when he is alone?

it will make a [[great]] difference whether he is seen or not.

when he is by himself he will not [[mind]] saying or doing many things
which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?

true. 
there is a [[principle]] of [[law]] and [[reason]] in him which bids him resist,
as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge
his [[sorrow]]? 

true. 
but when a [[man]] is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the
same object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct
principles in him? 

certainly. 
one of them is ready to [[follow]] the guidance of the [[law]]? 
how do you mean? 
the [[law]] would say that to be patient under suffering is [[best]], and
that we should not give way to [[impatience]], as there is no knowing
whether such things are [[good]] or [[evil]]; and nothing is gained by [[impatience]];
also, because no [[human]] thing is of serious importance, and [[grief]] stands
in the way of that which at the moment is most required.

what is most required? he [[asked]]. 
that we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the
dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which [[reason]] deems
best; not, like [[children]] who have had a fall, keeping hold of the
part struck and wasting [[time]] in setting up a howl, but always accustoming
the [[soul]] forthwith to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly
and fallen, banishing the cry of [[sorrow]] by the healing art [[arts]].

yes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of [[fortune]].

yes, i said; and the higher [[principle]] is ready to [[follow]] this suggestion
of [[reason]]? 

clearly. 
and the other [[principle]], which inclines us to recollection of our
troubles and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we
may call irrational, useless, and cowardly? 

indeed, we may. 
and does not the latter --i mean the rebellious [[principle]] --furnish
a [[great]] variety of materials for imitation? whereas the [[wise]] and calm
temperament, being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or
to appreciate when imitated, especially at a [[public]] festival when
a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre. for the feeling represented
is one to which they are strangers. 

certainly. 
then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature
made, nor is his art [[arts]] intended, to please or to affect the principle
in the [[soul]]; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper,
which is easily imitated? 

clearly. 
and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter,
for he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his creations have
an inferior [[degree]] of [[truth]] --in this, i say, he is like him; and
he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the
soul; and therefore we shall be [[right]] in refusing to admit him into
a well-ordered [[state]], because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens
the feelings and impairs the [[reason]]. as in a [[city]] when the [[evil]] are
permitted to have [[authority]] and the [[good]] are put out of the way, so
in the [[soul]] of [[man]], as we maintain, the imitative poet implants an
evil [[constitution]], for he indulges the irrational [[nature]] which has
no discernment of greater and less, but thinks [[think]] the same thing at one
time [[great]] and at another small-he is a manufacturer of images and
is very far removed from the [[truth]]. 

exactly. 
but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation:
--the [[power]] which poetry has of harming even the [[good]] (and there are
very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing? 

yes, certainly, if the effect is what you say. 
hear and [[judge]]: the [[best]] of us, as i conceive, when we listen to a
passage of [[homer]], or one of the tragedians, in which he represents
some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows [[sorrow]] in a long oration,
or weeping, and smiting his breast --the [[best]] of us, you [[know]], delight
in giving way to sympathy, and are in raptures at the excellence of
the poet who stirs our feelings most. 

yes, of course i [[know]]. 
but when any [[sorrow]] of our own happens to us, then you may observe
that we [[pride]] ourselves on the opposite quality --we would fain be
quiet and patient; this is the manly part, and the other which delighted
us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.

very true, he said. 
now can we be [[right]] in praising and admiring another who is doing
that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his
own [[person]]? 

no, he said, that is certainly not reasonable. 
nay, i said, quite reasonable from one point of view. 
what point of view? 
if you consider, i said, that when in misfortune we [[feel]] a natural
hunger and [[desire]] to relieve our [[sorrow]] by weeping and lamentation,
and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities
is satisfied and delighted by the poets;-the [[better]] [[nature]] in each
of us, not having been sufficiently trained by [[reason]] or habit, allows
the sympathetic element to break loose because the [[sorrow]] is another's;
and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself
in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good
man he is, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks [[think]] that the
pleasure is a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this
and the poem too? few persons [[person]] ever reflect, as i should imagine, that
from the [[evil]] of other [[men]] something of [[evil]] is communicated to themselves.
and so the feeling of [[sorrow]] which has gathered [[strength]] at the sight
of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own.

how very true! 
and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? there are jests
which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic
stage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused
by them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness; --the
case of [[pity]] is repeated; --there is a [[principle]] in [[human]] [[nature]] which
is disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by
reason, because you were afraid of being [[thought]] a buffoon, is now
let out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre,
you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic
poet at [[home]]. 

quite true, he said. 
and the same may be said of [[lust]] and anger and all the other affections,
of [[desire]] and [[pain]] and [[pleasure]], which are held to be inseparable
from every action ---in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions
instead of drying them up; she lets them [[rule]], although they ought
to be controlled, if [[mankind]] are ever to increase in [[happiness]] and
virtue. 

i cannot deny it. 
therefore, glaucon, i said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists
of [[homer]] declaring that he has been the educator of hellas, and that
he is profitable for [[education]] and for the ordering of [[human]] things,
and that you should take him up again and again and get to [[know]] him
and regulate your whole [[life]] according to him, we may [[love]] and honour
those who say these things --they are excellent [[people]], as far as
their lights [[light]] extend; and we are ready to acknowledge that [[homer]] is
the [[greatest]] of poets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain
firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises [[praise]] of famous
men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our [[state]].
for if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either
in epic or lyric verse, not [[law]] and the [[reason]] of [[mankind]], which by
common [[consent]] have ever been deemed [[best]], but [[pleasure]] and [[pain]] will
be the rulers in our [[state]]. 

that is most true, he said. 
and now since we have reverted to the [[subject]] of poetry, let this
our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment
in sending away out of our [[state]] an art [[arts]] having the tendencies which
we have described; for [[reason]] constrained us. but that she may impute
to us any harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there
is an ancient quarrel between [[philosophy]] and poetry; of which there
are many proofs, such as the saying of 'the yelping hound howling
at her [[lord]],' or of one 'mighty in the [[vain]] talk of fools [[fool]],' and 'the
mob of sages circumventing [[zeus]],' and the 'subtle thinkers who are
beggars after all'; and there are innumerable other signs of ancient
enmity between them. notwithstanding this, let us assure our sweet
friend and the sister [[arts]] of imitation that if she will only prove
her title to [[exist]] in a well-ordered [[state]] we shall be delighted to
receive her --we are very conscious of her charms; but we may not
on that account betray the [[truth]]. i dare say, glaucon, that you are
as much charmed by her as i am, especially when she appears in [[homer]]?

yes, indeed, i am greatly charmed. 
shall i propose, then, that she be allowed to return from [[exile]], but
upon this condition only --that she make a defence of herself in lyrical
or some other metre? 

certainly. 
and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers
of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her
behalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful
to states and to [[human]] [[life]], and we will listen in a kindly spirit;
for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers --i mean,
if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight? 

certainly, he said, we shall the gainers. 
if her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons [[person]] who
are enamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when
they [[think]] their desires [[desire]] are opposed to their interests, so too must
we after the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle.
we too are inspired by that [[love]] of poetry which the [[education]] of
noble states has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her
appear at her [[best]] and truest; but so long as she is unable to make
good her defence, this argument of ours shall be a charm to us, which
we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains; that we
may not fall away into the childish [[love]] of her which captivates the
many. at all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we
have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the
truth; and he who listens to her, fearing for the safety of the city
which is within him, should be on his guard against her seductions
and make our words his [[law]]. 

yes, he said, i quite agree with you. 
yes, i said, my dear glaucon, for [[great]] is the issue at stake, greater
than appears, whether a [[man]] is to be [[good]] or [[bad]]. and what will any
one be profited if under the influence of [[honour]] or [[money]] or [[power]],
aye, or under the excitement of poetry, he neglect [[justice]] and [[virtue]]?

yes, he said; i have been convinced by the argument, as i believe
that any one else would have been. 

and yet no mention has been made of the [[greatest]] prizes and rewards
which await [[virtue]]. 

what, are there any greater still? if there are, they must be of an
inconceivable greatness. 

why, i said, what was ever [[great]] in a short [[time]]? the whole period
of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison
with eternity? 

say rather 'nothing,' he replied. 
and should an [[immortal]] being seriously [[think]] of this little space
rather than of the whole? 

of the whole, certainly. but why do you ask? 
are you not aware, i said, that the [[soul]] of [[man]] is [[immortal]] and imperishable?

he looked at me in astonishment, and said: no, by [[heaven]]: and are
you really prepared to maintain this? 

yes, i said, i ought to be, and you too --there is no difficulty in
proving it. 

i see a [[great]] difficulty; but i should like to hear you [[state]] this
argument of which you make so [[light]]. 

listen then. 
i am attending. 
there is a thing which you call [[good]] and another which you call [[evil]]?

yes, he replied. 
would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying
element is the [[evil]], and the saving and improving element the [[good]]?

yes. 
and you admit that every thing has a [[good]] and also an [[evil]]; as ophthalmia
is the [[evil]] of the [[eyes]] and disease of the whole [[body]]; as mildew is
of corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in everything,
or in almost everything, there is an inherent [[evil]] and disease?

yes, he said. 
and anything which is infected by any of these evils [[evil]] is made [[evil]],
and at [[last]] wholly dissolves and dies? 

true. 
the [[vice]] and [[evil]] which is inherent in each is the destruction of
each; and if this does not [[destroy]] them there is nothing else that
will; for [[good]] certainly will not [[destroy]] them, nor again, that which
is neither [[good]] nor [[evil]]. 

certainly not. 
if, then, we find any [[nature]] which having this inherent corruption
cannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be [[certain]] that of such a
nature there is no destruction? 

that may be assumed. 
well, i said, and is there no [[evil]] which corrupts the [[soul]]?

yes, he said, there are all the evils [[evil]] which we were just now passing
in review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.

but does any of these dissolve or [[destroy]] her? --and here do not let
us fall into the error of supposing that the [[unjust]] and foolish [[man]],
when he is detected, perishes through his own [[injustice]], which is
an [[evil]] of the [[soul]]. take the analogy of the [[body]]: the [[evil]] of the
body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the [[body]];
and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation
through their own [[corruption]] attaching to them and inhering in them
and so destroying them. is not this true? 

yes. 
consider the [[soul]] in like manner. does the [[injustice]] or other evil
which exists in the [[soul]] waste and consume her? do they by attaching
to the [[soul]] and inhering in her at [[last]] bring her to [[death]], and so
separate her from the [[body]] ? 

certainly not. 
and yet, i said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish
from without through affection of external [[evil]] which could not be
destroyed from within by a [[corruption]] of its own? 

it is, he replied. 
consider, i said, glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether
staleness, decomposition, or any other [[bad]] quality, when confined
to the actual food, is not supposed to [[destroy]] the [[body]]; although,
if the badness of food communicates [[corruption]] to the [[body]], then we
should say that the [[body]] has been destroyed by a [[corruption]] of itself,
which is disease, brought on by this; but that the [[body]], being one
thing, can be destroyed by the badness of food, which is another,
and which does not engender any [[natural]] infection --this we shall
absolutely deny? 

very true. 
and, on the same [[principle]], unless some bodily [[evil]] can [[produce]] an
evil of the [[soul]], we must not suppose that the [[soul]], which is one
thing, can be dissolved by any merely external [[evil]] which belongs
to another? 

yes, he said, there is [[reason]] in that. 
either then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains unrefuted,
let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the knife put
to the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole [[body]] into the minutest
pieces, can [[destroy]] the [[soul]], until she herself is proved to become
more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done
to the [[body]]; but that the [[soul]], or anything else if not destroyed
by an internal [[evil]], can be destroyed by an external one, is not to.
be affirmed by any [[man]]. 

and surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls [[soul]] of men
become more [[unjust]] in consequence of [[death]]. 

but if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the
soul boldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become
more [[evil]] and unrighteous, then, if the speaker is [[right]], i suppose
that [[injustice]], like disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the [[unjust]],
and that those who take this disorder [[die]] by the [[natural]] inherent
power of destruction which [[evil]] has, and which kills them sooner or
later, but in quite another way from that in which, at [[present]], the
wicked receive [[death]] at the hands of others as the penalty of their
deeds? 

nay, he said, in that case [[injustice]], if fatal to the [[unjust]], will
not be so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from [[evil]].
but i rather suspect the opposite to be the [[truth]], and that injustice
which, if it have the [[power]], will murder others, keeps the murderer
alive --aye, and well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place
from being a house of [[death]]. 

true, i said; if the inherent [[natural]] [[vice]] or [[evil]] of the [[soul]] is
unable to kill or [[destroy]] her, hardly will that which is appointed
to be the destruction of some other [[body]], [[destroy]] a [[soul]] or anything
else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction.

yes, that can hardly be. 
but the [[soul]] which cannot be destroyed by an [[evil]], whether inherent
or external, must [[exist]] for ever, and if existing for ever, must be
immortal? 

certainly. 
that is the conclusion, i said; and, if a true conclusion, then the
souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will
not diminish in number. neither will they increase, for the increase
of the [[immortal]] natures [[nature]] must come from something mortal, and all things
would thus end in immortality. 

very true. 
but this we cannot [[believe]] --reason will not allow us --any more than
we can [[believe]] the [[soul]], in her truest [[nature]], to be full of variety
and difference and dissimilarity. 

what do you mean? he said. 
the [[soul]], i said, being, as is now proven, [[immortal]], must be the fairest
of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?

certainly not. 
her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there
are many other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we
now behold her, marred by communion with the [[body]] and other miseries,
you must contemplate her with the eye of [[reason]], in her original purity;
and then her [[beauty]] will be revealed, and [[justice]] and [[injustice]] and
all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly.
thus far, we have spoken the [[truth]] concerning her as she appears at
present, but we must [[remember]] also that we have seen her only in a
condition which may be compared to that of the sea-god glaucus, whose
original image can hardly be discerned because his [[natural]] members
are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of
ways, and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells
and stones, so that he is more like some monster than he is to his
own [[natural]] form. and the [[soul]] which we behold is in a similar condition,
disfigured by ten thousand ills. but not there, glaucon, not there
must we look. 

where then? 
at her [[love]] of [[wisdom]]. let us see whom she affects, and what society
and converse she seeks in [[virtue]] of her near kindred with the immortal
and eternal and [[divine]]; also how different she would become if wholly
following this superior [[principle]], and borne by a [[divine]] impulse out
of the ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and
shells and things of [[earth]] and rock which in wild variety spring up
around her because she feeds upon [[earth]], and is overgrown by the good
things of this [[life]] as they are termed: then you would see her as
she is, and [[know]] whether she has one shape only or many, or what her
nature is. of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this
present [[life]] i [[think]] that we have now said enough. 

true, he replied. 
and thus, i said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument;
we have not introduced the rewards [[reward]] and glories of [[justice]], which,
as you were saying, are to be found in [[homer]] and hesiod; but justice
in her own [[nature]] has been shown to be [[best]] for the [[soul]] in her own
nature. let a [[man]] do what is just, whether he have the ring of gyges
or not, and even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the
helmet of [[hades]]. 

very true. 
and now, glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how
many and how [[great]] are the rewards [[reward]] which [[justice]] and the other virtues
procure to the [[soul]] from gods and [[men]], both in [[life]] and after [[death]].

certainly not, he said. 
will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?

what did i borrow? 
the assumption that the just [[man]] should appear [[unjust]] and the unjust
just: for you were of [[opinion]] that even if the true [[state]] of the case
could not possibly escape the [[eyes]] of gods and [[men]], still this admission
ought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure
justice might be weighed against pure [[injustice]]. do you [[remember]]?

i should be much to blame if i had forgotten. 
then, as the cause is decided, i demand on behalf of [[justice]] that
the estimation in which she is held by gods and [[men]] and which we acknowledge
to be her due should now be restored to her by us; since she has been
shown to confer reality, and not to [[deceive]] those who truly possess
her, let what has been taken from her be given back, that so she may
win that palm of appearance which is hers also, and which she gives
to her own. 

the demand, he said, is just. 
in the first place, i said --and this is the first thing which you
will have to give back --the [[nature]] both of the just and [[unjust]] is
truly known to the gods. 

granted. 
and if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the
other the [[enemy]] of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?

true. 
and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all
things at their [[best]], excepting only such [[evil]] as is the necessary
consequence of former sins [[sin]]? 

certainly. 
then this must be our notion of the just [[man]], that even when he is
in [[poverty]] or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things
will in the end [[work]] together for [[good]] to him in [[life]] and [[death]]: for
the gods have a [[care]] of any one whose [[desire]] is to become just and
to be like [[god]], as far as [[man]] can attain the [[divine]] likeness, by the
pursuit of [[virtue]]? 

yes, he said; if he is like [[god]] he will surely not be neglected by
him. 

and of the [[unjust]] may not the opposite be supposed? 
certainly. 
such, then, are the palms of [[victory]] which the gods give the just?

that is my conviction. 
and what do they receive of [[men]]? look at things as they really are,
and you will see that the clever [[unjust]] are in the case of runners,
who run well from the starting-place to the goal but not back again
from the goal: they go off at a [[great]] pace, but in the end only look
foolish, slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders,
and without a [[crown]]; but the true runner comes to the finish and receives
the prize and is crowned. and this is the way with the just; he who
endures to the end of every action and [[occasion]] of his entire life
has a [[good]] report and carries off the prize which [[men]] have to bestow.

true. 
and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which
you were attributing to the fortunate [[unjust]]. i shall say of them,
what you were saying of the others, that as they grow older, they
become rulers in their own [[city]] if they [[care]] to be; they [[marry]] whom
they like and give in [[marriage]] to whom they will; all that you said
of the others i now say of these. and, on the other hand, of the unjust
i say that the greater number, even though they escape in their [[youth]],
are found out at [[last]] and look foolish at the end of their course,
and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger
and citizen; they are beaten and then come those things unfit for
ears polite, as you truly term them; they will be racked and have
their [[eyes]] burned out, as you were saying. and you may suppose that
i have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors. but will you
let me assume, without reciting them, that these things are true?

certainly, he said, what you say is true. 
these, then, are the prizes and rewards [[reward]] and gifts which are bestowed
upon the just by gods and [[men]] in this [[present]] [[life]], in addition to
the other [[good]] things which [[justice]] of herself provides.

yes, he said; and they are [[fair]] and lasting. 
and yet, i said, all these are as nothing, either in number or greatness
in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and
unjust after [[death]]. and you ought to hear them, and then both just
and [[unjust]] will have received from us a full payment of the debt which
the argument owes to them. 

speak, he said; there are few things which i would more gladly hear.

socrates 

well, i said, i will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which odysseus
tells to the hero alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero, er the
son of armenius, a pamphylian by birth. he was slain in [[battle]], and
ten days afterwards, when the bodies [[body]] of the [[dead]] were taken up already
in a [[state]] of [[corruption]], his [[body]] was found unaffected by decay,
and carried away [[home]] to be buried. and on the twelfth day, as he
was lying on the [[funeral]] pile, he returned to [[life]] and told them what
he had seen in the other [[world]]. he said that when his [[soul]] left the
body he went on a [[journey]] with a [[great]] company, and that they came
to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the [[earth]];
they were near together, and over against them were two other openings
in the [[heaven]] above. in the intermediate space there were judges [[judge]] seated,
who commanded the just, after they had given [[judgment]] on them and
had bound their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the heavenly
way on the [[right]] hand; and in like manner the [[unjust]] were bidden by
them to descend by the lower way on the left hand; these also bore
the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs. he drew near,
and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry
the report of the other [[world]] to [[men]], and they bade him hear and see
all that was to be heard and seen in that place. then he beheld and
saw on one side the souls [[soul]] departing at either opening of [[heaven]] and
earth when sentence had been given on them; and at the two other openings
other souls [[soul]], some ascending out of the [[earth]] dusty and worn with travel,
some descending out of [[heaven]] clean and bright. and arriving ever
and anon they seemed to have come from a long [[journey]], and they went
forth with gladness into the meadow, where they encamped as at a festival;
and those who knew one another embraced and conversed, the souls [[soul]] which
came from [[earth]] curiously enquiring about the things above, and the
souls which came from [[heaven]] about the things beneath. and they told
one another of what had happened by the way, those from below weeping
and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured
and seen in their [[journey]] beneath the [[earth]] (now the [[journey]] lasted
a thousand years), while those from above were describing heavenly
delights and visions of inconceivable [[beauty]]. the story, glaucon,
would take too long to tell; but the sum was this: --he said that
for every [[wrong]] which they had done to any one they [[suffered]] tenfold;
or once in a hundred years --such being reckoned to be the length
of man's [[man]] [[life]], and the penalty being thus paid ten times [[time]] in a thousand
years. if, for [[example]], there were any who had been the cause of many
deaths, or had betrayed or enslaved cities [[city]] or armies [[army]], or been guilty
of any other [[evil]] behaviour, for each and all of their offences they
received [[punishment]] ten times [[time]] over, and the rewards [[reward]] of beneficence
and [[justice]] and holiness were in the same proportion. i need hardly
repeat what he said concerning [[young]] [[children]] dying almost as soon
as they were born. of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of
murderers, there were retributions other and greater far which he
described. he mentioned that he was [[present]] when one of the spirits
asked another, 'where is ardiaeus the [[great]]?' (now this ardiaeus lived
a thousand years before the [[time]] of er: he had been the [[tyrant]] of
some [[city]] of pamphylia, and had murdered his aged [[father]] and his elder
brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)
the [[answer]] of the other spirit was: 'he comes not hither and will
never come. and this,' said he, 'was one of the dreadful sights which
we ourselves witnessed. we were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having
completed all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden
ardiaeus appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants [[tyrant]]; and
there were also besides the tyrants [[tyrant]] private individuals [[individual]] who had been
great criminals [[criminal]]: they were just, as they fancied, about to return
into the upper [[world]], but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave
a roar, whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had
not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend; and then wild men
of fiery aspect, who were standing by and heard the sound, seized
and carried them off; and ardiaeus and others they bound head and
foot and hand, and threw them down and flayed them with scourges,
and dragged them along the road at the side, carding them on thorns
like wool, and declaring to the passers-by what were their crimes,
and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell.' and of
all the many terrors which they had endured, he said that there was
none like the terror which each of them [[felt]] at that moment, lest
they should hear the voice; and when there was [[silence]], one by one
they ascended with exceeding joy. these, said er, were the penalties
and retributions, and there were blessings as [[great]]. 

now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days,
on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their [[journey]], and,
on the fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they
could see from above a line of [[light]], straight as a column, extending
right through the whole [[heaven]] and through the [[earth]], in colour resembling
the rainbow, only brighter and purer; another day's [[journey]] brought
them to the place, and there, in the midst of the [[light]], they saw
the ends of the chains of [[heaven]] let down from above: for this light
is the belt of [[heaven]], and holds together the circle of the [[universe]],
like the under-girders of a trireme. from these ends is extended the
spindle of necessity, on which all the revolutions [[revolution]] turn. the shaft
and hook of this spindle are made of steel, and the whorl is made
partly of steel and also partly of other materials. now the whorl
is in form like the whorl used on [[earth]]; and the description of it
implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped
out, and into this is fitted another lesser one, and another, and
another, and four others, making eight in all, like vessels which
fit into one another; the whorls show their edges on the upper side,
and on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl. this
is pierced by the spindle, which is driven [[home]] through the centre
of the eighth. the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest,
and the seven inner whorls are narrower, in the following proportions
--the sixth is next to the first in size, the fourth next to the sixth;
then comes the eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth is sixth, the
third is seventh, [[last]] and eighth comes the second. the largest (of
fixed stars) is spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is brightest; the
eighth (or moon) coloured by the reflected [[light]] of the seventh; the
second and fifth (saturn and mercury) are in colour like one another,
and yellower than the preceding; the third (venus) has the whitest
light; the fourth (mars) is reddish; the sixth (jupiter) is in whiteness
second. now the whole spindle has the same motion; but, as the whole
revolves in one direction, the seven inner circles move slowly in
the other, and of these the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness
are the seventh, sixth, and fifth, which move together; third in swiftness
appeared to move according to the [[law]] of this reversed motion the
fourth; the third appeared fourth and the second fifth. the spindle
turns on the knees of necessity; and on the upper surface of each
circle is a siren, who goes round with them, hymning a [[single]] tone
or note. the eight together form one harmony; and round about, at
equal intervals, there is another band, three in number, each sitting
upon her [[throne]]: these are the fates [[fate]], daughters [[daughter]] of necessity, who
are clothed in [[white]] robes and have chaplets upon their heads, lachesis
and clotho and atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony
of the sirens --lachesis singing of the [[past]], clotho of the [[present]],
atropos of the future; clotho from [[time]] to [[time]] assisting with a touch
of her [[right]] hand the [[revolution]] of the outer circle of the whorl
or spindle, and atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the
inner ones, and lachesis laying hold of either in turn, first with
one hand and then with the other. 

when er and the spirits arrived, their [[duty]] was to go at once to lachesis;
but first of all there came a [[prophet]] who arranged them in order;
then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of lives [[life]],
and having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'hear the word
of lachesis, the [[daughter]] of necessity. mortal souls [[soul]], behold a new
cycle of [[life]] and [[mortality]]. your genius will not be allotted to you,
but you choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot have
the first [[choice]], and the [[life]] which he chooses shall be his [[destiny]].
virtue is [[free]], and as a [[man]] honours [[honour]] or dishonours her he will have
more or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser --god
is justified.' when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots
indifferently among them all, and each of them took up the lot which
fell near him, all but er himself (he was not allowed), and each as
he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained. then the
interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives [[life]];
and there were many more lives [[life]] than the souls [[soul]] [[present]], and they were
of all sorts. there were lives [[life]] of every animal and of [[man]] in every
condition. and there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the
tyrant's [[life]], others which broke off in the middle and came to an
end in [[poverty]] and [[exile]] and beggary; and there were lives [[life]] of famous
men, some who were famous for their form and [[beauty]] as well as for
their [[strength]] and [[success]] in games, or, again, for their birth and
the qualities of their [[ancestors]]; and some who were the reverse of
famous for the opposite qualities. and of [[women]] likewise; there was
not, however, any definite [[character]] them, because the [[soul]], when
choosing a new [[life]], must of necessity become different. but there
was every other quality, and the all mingled with one another, and
also with elements of [[wealth]] and [[poverty]], and disease and health;
and there were mean states also. and here, my dear glaucon, is the
supreme peril of our [[human]] [[state]]; and therefore the utmost [[care]] should
be taken. let each one of us leave every other [[kind]] of [[knowledge]] and
seek and [[follow]] one thing only, if peradventure he may be able to
learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern
between [[good]] and [[evil]], and so to choose always and everywhere the
better [[life]] as he has opportunity. he should consider the bearing
of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively
upon [[virtue]]; he should [[know]] what the effect of [[beauty]] is when combined
with [[poverty]] or [[wealth]] in a particular [[soul]], and what are the good
and [[evil]] consequences of [[noble]] and humble birth, of private and public
station, of [[strength]] and weakness, of cleverness and dullness, and
of all the [[soul]], and the operation of them when conjoined; he will
then look at the [[nature]] of the [[soul]], and from the consideration of
all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better
and which is the worse; and so he will choose, giving the name of
evil to the [[life]] which will make his [[soul]] more [[unjust]], and [[good]] to
the [[life]] which will make his [[soul]] more just; all else he will disregard.
for we have seen and [[know]] that this is the [[best]] [[choice]] both in life
and after [[death]]. a [[man]] must take with him into the [[world]] below an
adamantine [[faith]] in [[truth]] and [[right]], that there too he may be undazzled
by the [[desire]] of [[wealth]] or the other allurements of [[evil]], lest, coming
upon tyrannies and similar villainies, he do irremediable wrongs [[wrong]] to
others and suffer yet worse himself; but let him [[know]] how to choose
the mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as far as possible,
not only in this [[life]] but in all that which is to come. for this is
the way of [[happiness]]. 

and according to the report of the messenger from the other world
this was what the [[prophet]] said at the [[time]]: 'even for the [[last]] comer,
if he chooses wisely and will [[live]] diligently, there is appointed
a [[happy]] and not undesirable existence. let not him who chooses first
be careless, and let not the [[last]] despair.' and when he had spoken,
he who had the first [[choice]] came forward and in a moment chose the
greatest [[tyranny]]; his [[mind]] having been darkened by folly and sensuality,
he had not [[thought]] out the whole matter before he chose, and did not
at first sight perceive that he was fated, among other evils [[evil]], to devour
his own [[children]]. but when he had [[time]] to reflect, and saw what was
in the lot, he began to beat his breast and lament over his [[choice]],
forgetting the proclamation of the [[prophet]]; for, instead of throwing
the blame of his misfortune on himself, he accused [[chance]] and the
gods, and everything rather than himself. now he was one of those
who came from [[heaven]], and in a former [[life]] had dwelt in a well-ordered
state, but his [[virtue]] was a matter of habit only, and he had no [[philosophy]].
and it was true of others who were similarly overtaken, that the greater
number of them came from [[heaven]] and therefore they had never been
schooled by [[trial]], whereas the pilgrims who came from [[earth]], having
themselves [[suffered]] and seen others suffer, were not in a hurry to
choose. and owing to this inexperience of theirs, and also because
the lot was a [[chance]], many of the souls [[soul]] exchanged a [[good]] [[destiny]] for
an [[evil]] or an [[evil]] for a [[good]]. for if a [[man]] had always on his arrival
in this [[world]] dedicated himself from the first to sound [[philosophy]],
and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot, he might,
as the messenger reported, be [[happy]] here, and also his [[journey]] to
another [[life]] and return to this, instead of being rough and underground,
would be smooth and heavenly. most [[curious]], he said, was the spectacle
--sad and laughable and [[strange]]; for the [[choice]] of the souls [[soul]] was in
most cases based on their [[experience]] of a previous [[life]]. there he
saw the [[soul]] which had once been orpheus choosing the [[life]] of a swan
out of enmity to the [[race]] of [[women]], hating to be born of a woman because
they had been his murderers; he beheld also the [[soul]] of thamyras choosing
the [[life]] of a nightingale; birds, on the other hand, like the swan
and other musicians, wanting to be [[men]]. the [[soul]] which obtained the
twentieth lot chose the [[life]] of a lion, and this was the [[soul]] of ajax
the [[son]] of telamon, who would not be a [[man]], remembering the injustice
which was done him the [[judgment]] about the arms. the next was [[agamemnon]],
who took the [[life]] of an eagle, because, like ajax, he hated human
nature by [[reason]] of his sufferings. about the middle came the lot
of atalanta; she, seeing the [[great]] fame of an athlete, was unable
to resist the temptation: and after her there followed the [[soul]] of
epeus the [[son]] of panopeus passing into the [[nature]] of a woman cunning
in the [[arts]]; and far away among the [[last]] who chose, the [[soul]] of the
jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey. there came also
the [[soul]] of odysseus having yet to make a [[choice]], and his lot happened
to be the [[last]] of them all. now the recollection of former tolls had
disenchanted him of [[ambition]], and he went about for a considerable
time in search of the [[life]] of a private [[man]] who had no cares [[care]]; he had
some difficulty in finding this, which was lying about and had been
neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that he would
have done the had his lot been first instead of [[last]], and that he
was delighted to have it. and not only did [[men]] pass into animals,
but i must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who
changed into one another and into corresponding [[human]] natures [[nature]] --the
good into the gentle and the [[evil]] into the savage, in all sorts of
combinations. 

all the souls [[soul]] had now chosen their lives [[life]], and they went in the order
of their [[choice]] to lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they
had severally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives [[life]] and the fulfiller
of the [[choice]]: this genius [[led]] the souls [[soul]] first to clotho, and drew
them within the [[revolution]] of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus
ratifying the [[destiny]] of each; and then, when they were fastened to
this, carried them to atropos, who spun the threads and made them
irreversible, whence without turning round they passed beneath the
throne of necessity; and when they had all passed, they marched on
in a scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness, which was a barren
waste destitute of trees and verdure; and then towards evening they
encamped by the river of unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can
hold; of this they were all obliged to drink a [[certain]] quantity, and
those who were not saved by [[wisdom]] drank more than was necessary;
and each one as he drank forgot all things. now after they had gone
to rest, about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and
earthquake, and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all
manner of ways to their birth, like stars shooting. he himself was
hindered from drinking the water. but in what manner or by what means
he returned to the [[body]] he could not say; only, in the morning, awaking
suddenly, he found himself lying on the pyre. 

and thus, glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, and
will save us if we are [[obedient]] to the word spoken; and we shall pass
safely over the river of forgetfulness and our [[soul]] will not be defiled.
wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way
and [[follow]] after [[justice]] and [[virtue]] always, considering that the soul
is [[immortal]] and able to endure every sort of [[good]] and every sort of
evil. thus shall we [[live]] dear to one another and to the gods, both
while remaining here and when, like conquerors in the games who go
round to gather gifts, we receive our [[reward]]. and it shall be well
with us both in this [[life]] and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years
which we have been describing. 

the end
