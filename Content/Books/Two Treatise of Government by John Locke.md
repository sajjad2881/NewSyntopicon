two treatises of [[government]]. in the former the false principles [[principle]] and
foundation of sir robert filmer and his followers are detected and
overthrown. the latter is an essay concerning the true original extent
and end of civil [[government]].


1764 editor's note the [[present]] edition of this [[book]] has not only been
collated with the first three editions, which were published during the
author's [[life]], but also has the advantage of his [[last]] corrections and
improvements, from a copy delivered by him to mr. peter coste,
communicated to the editor, and now lodged in [[christ]] college, cambridge.




preface

reader, thou hast here the beginning and end of a discourse concerning
government; what [[fate]] has otherwise disposed of the papers that should
have filled up the middle, and were more than all the rest, it is not
worth while to tell thee. these, which remain, i [[hope]] are sufficient to
establish the [[throne]] of our [[great]] restorer, our [[present]] [[king]] william; to
make [[good]] his title, in the [[consent]] of the [[people]], which being the only
one of all lawful governments [[government]], he has more fully and clearly, than any
prince in christendom; and to justify to the [[world]] the [[people]] of
england, whose [[love]] of their just and [[natural]] rights [[right]], with their
resolution to preserve them, saved the nation when it was on the very
brink of [[slavery]] and ruin. if these papers have that evidence, i flatter
myself is to be found in them, there will be no [[great]] miss of those
which are lost, and my reader may be satisfied without them: for i
imagine, i shall have neither the [[time]], nor inclination to repeat my
pains, and fill up the wanting part of my [[answer]], by tracing sir robert
again, through all the windings and obscurities, which are to be met
with in the several branches of his wonderful [[system]]. the [[king]], and body
of the nation, have since so thoroughly confuted his hypothesis, that i
suppose no [[body]] hereafter will have either the confidence to appear
against our [[common]] safety, and be again an advocate for [[slavery]]; or the
weakness to be deceived with contradictions dressed up in a popular
stile, and well-turned periods: for if any one will be at the pains [[pain]],
himself, in those parts, which are here untouched, to strip sir robert's
discourses of the flourish of doubtful expressions, and endeavour to
reduce his words to direct, positive, intelligible propositions, and
then compare them one with another, he will quickly be satisfied, there
was never so much glib nonsense put together in well-sounding english.
if he [[think]] it not worth while to examine his works [[work]] all thro', let him
make an experiment in that part, where he treats of usurpation; and let
him try, whether he can, with all his [[skill]], make sir robert
intelligible, and consistent with himself, or [[common]] sense. i should not
speak so plainly of a gentleman, long since [[past]] answering, had not the
pulpit, of late years, publicly owned his doctrine, and made it the
current divinity of the times [[time]]. it is necessary those [[men]], who taking on
them to be teachers, have so dangerously misled others, should be openly
shewed of what [[authority]] this their patriarch is, whom they have so
blindly followed, that so they may either retract what upon so ill
grounds they have vented, and cannot be maintained; or else justify
those principles [[principle]] which they preached up for gospel; though they had no
better an author than an english courtier: for i should not have writ
against sir robert, or taken the pains [[pain]] to shew his mistakes,
inconsistencies, and want of (what he so much boasts of, and pretends
wholly to build on) scripture-proofs, were there not [[men]] amongst us,
who, by crying up his books [[book]], and espousing his doctrine, save me from
the reproach of writing against a [[dead]] adversary. they have been so
zealous in this point, that, if i have done him any [[wrong]], i cannot hope
they should spare me. i [[wish]], where they have done the [[truth]] and the
public [[wrong]], they would be as ready to redress it, and allow its just
weight to this reflection, viz. that there cannot be done a greater
mischief to [[prince]] and [[people]], than the propagating [[wrong]] notions
concerning [[government]]; that so at [[last]] all times [[time]] might not have reason
to [[complain]] of the drum ecclesiastic. if any one, concerned really for
truth, undertake the confutation of my hypothesis, i promise him either
to recant my mistake, upon [[fair]] conviction; or to [[answer]] his
difficulties. but he must [[remember]] two things.

first, that cavilling here and there, at some expression, or little
incident of my discourse, is not an [[answer]] to my [[book]].

secondly, that i shall not take railing for arguments, nor [[think]] either
of these worth my notice, though i shall always look on myself as bound
to give satisfaction to any one, who shall appear to be conscientiously
scrupulous in the point, and shall shew any just grounds for his
scruples.

i have nothing more, but to advertise the reader, that observations
stands for observations on hobbs, milton, &c. and that a bare quotation
of pages always means pages of his patriarcha, edition 1680.




book ii




chapter. i.

an essay concerning the true original, extent and end of civil
government


sect. 1. it having been shewn in the foregoing discourse,

(<i>1</i>). that adam had not, either by [[natural]] [[right]] of fatherhood, or by
positive donation from [[god]], any such [[authority]] over his [[children]], or
dominion over the [[world]], as is pretended:

(<i>2</i>). that if he had, his heirs, yet, had no [[right]] to it:

(<i>3</i>). that if his heirs had, there being no [[law]] of [[nature]] nor positive
law of [[god]] that determines which is the [[right]] heir in all cases that may
arise, the [[right]] of succession, and consequently of bearing [[rule]], could
not have been certainly determined:

(<i>4</i>). that if even that had been determined, yet the [[knowledge]] of which
is the eldest line of adam's [[posterity]], being so long since utterly
lost, that in the races [[race]] of [[mankind]] and families [[family]] of the [[world]], there
remains not to one above another, the least pretence to be the eldest
house, and to have the [[right]] of [[inheritance]]:

all these premises having, as i [[think]], been clearly made out, it is
impossible that the rulers now on [[earth]] should make any benefit, or
derive any the least shadow of [[authority]] from that, which is held to be
the fountain of all [[power]], adam's private dominion and paternal
jurisdiction; so that he that will not give just [[occasion]] to [[think]] that
all [[government]] in the [[world]] is the product only of [[force]] and [[violence]],
and that [[men]] [[live]] together by no other rules [[rule]] but that of beasts, where
the strongest carries it, and so lay a foundation for perpetual disorder
and mischief, tumult, sedition and rebellion, (things that the followers
of that hypothesis so loudly cry out against) must of necessity find out
another rise of [[government]], another original of [[political]] [[power]], and
another way of designing and knowing the persons [[person]] that have it, than what
sir robert filmer hath taught us.

sect. 2. to this [[purpose]], i [[think]] it may not be amiss, to set down what
i take to be [[political]] [[power]]; that the [[power]] of a magistrate over a
subject may be distinguished from that of a [[father]] over his [[children]], a
master over his servant, a husband over his [[wife]], and a [[lord]] over his
slave. all which distinct powers [[power]] happening sometimes together in the
same [[man]], if he be considered under these different relations, it may
help us to distinguish these powers [[power]] one from [[wealth]], a [[father]] of a
family, and a captain of a galley.

sect. 3. [[political]] [[power]], then, i take to be a [[right]] of making laws [[law]] with
penalties of [[death]], and consequently all less penalties, for the
regulating and preserving of [[property]], and of employing the [[force]] of the
community, in the execution of such laws [[law]], and in the defence of the
commonwealth from [[foreign]] injury; and all this only for the public
good.




chapter. ii.

of the [[state]] of [[nature]].


sect. 4. to [[understand]] [[political]] [[power]] [[right]], and derive it from its
original, we must consider, what [[state]] all [[men]] are naturally in, and
that is, a [[state]] of [[perfect]] [[freedom]] to order their actions, and dispose
of their possessions and persons [[person]], as they [[think]] fit, within the bounds
of the [[law]] of [[nature]], without asking leave, or depending upon the will
of any other [[man]].

a [[state]] also of equality, wherein all the [[power]] and jurisdiction is
reciprocal, no one having more than another; there being nothing more
evident, than that creatures of the same [[species]] and rank, promiscuously
born to all the same advantages of [[nature]], and the use of the same
faculties, should also be [[equal]] one amongst another without
subordination or subjection, unless the [[lord]] and master of them all
should, by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another,
and confer on him, by an evident and clear appointment, an undoubted
right to dominion and sovereignty.

sect. 5. this equality of [[men]] by [[nature]], the judicious hooker looks upon
as so evident in itself, and beyond all [[question]], that he makes it the
foundation of that obligation to mutual [[love]] amongst [[men]], on which he
builds the duties [[duty]] they owe one another, and from whence he derives the
great maxims [[maxim]] of [[justice]] and charity. his words are,

/#
     the like [[natural]] inducement hath brought [[men]] to [[know]] that it is no
     less their [[duty]], to [[love]] others than themselves; for seeing those
     things which are [[equal]], must needs all have one measure; if i
     cannot but [[wish]] to receive [[good]], even as much at every man's [[man]] hands,
     as any [[man]] can [[wish]] unto his own [[soul]], how should i look to have
     any part of my [[desire]] herein satisfied, unless myself be careful to
     satisfy the like [[desire]], which is undoubtedly in other [[men]], being
     of one and the same [[nature]]? to have any thing offered them
     repugnant to this [[desire]], must needs in all respects [[respect]] grieve them as
     much as me; so that if i do harm, i must look to suffer, there
     being no [[reason]] that others should shew greater measure of [[love]] to
     me, than they have by me shewed unto them: my [[desire]] therefore to
     be loved of my equals [[equal]] in [[nature]] as much as possible may be,
     imposeth upon me a [[natural]] [[duty]] of bearing to them-ward fully the
     like affection; from which relation of equality between ourselves
     and them that are as ourselves, what several rules [[rule]] and canons
     [[natural]] [[reason]] hath drawn, for direction of [[life]], no [[man]] is
     ignorant, eccl. pol. lib. 1.


#/

sect. 6. but though this be a [[state]] of [[liberty]], yet it is not a [[state]] of
licence: though [[man]] in that [[state]] have an uncontroulable [[liberty]] to
dispose of his [[person]] or possessions, yet he has not [[liberty]] to destroy
himself, or so much as any creature in his possession, but where some
nobler use than its bare preservation calls for it. the [[state]] of nature
has a [[law]] of [[nature]] to govern it, which obliges every one: and [[reason]],
which is that [[law]], teaches [[teach]] all [[mankind]], who will but consult it, that
being all [[equal]] and independent, no one ought to harm another in his
life, health, [[liberty]], or possessions: for [[men]] being all the workmanship
of one omnipotent, and infinitely [[wise]] maker; all the servants of one
sovereign master, sent into the [[world]] by his order, and about his
business; they are his [[property]], whose workmanship they are, made to
last during his, not one another's [[pleasure]]: and being furnished with
like faculties, sharing all in one [[community]] of [[nature]], there cannot be
supposed any such subordination among us, that may authorize us to
destroy one another, as if we were made for one another's uses, as the
inferior ranks of creatures are for our's. every one, as he is bound to
preserve himself, and not to quit his station wilfully, so by the like
reason, when his own preservation comes not in competition, ought he, as
much as he can, to preserve the rest of [[mankind]], and may not, unless it
be to do [[justice]] on an offender, take away, or impair the [[life]], or what
tends to the preservation of the [[life]], the [[liberty]], health, limb, or
goods of another.

sect. 7. and that all [[men]] may be restrained from invading others rights [[right]],
and from doing hurt to one another, and the [[law]] of [[nature]] be observed,
which willeth the [[peace]] and preservation of all [[mankind]], the execution
of the [[law]] of [[nature]] is, in that [[state]], put into every man's [[man]] hands,
whereby every one has a [[right]] to punish the transgressors of that [[law]] to
such a [[degree]], as may hinder its violation: for the [[law]] of [[nature]] would,
as all other laws [[law]] that concern [[men]] in this [[world]] be in [[vain]], if there
were no [[body]] that in the [[state]] of [[nature]] had a [[power]] to execute that
law, and thereby preserve the [[innocent]] and restrain offenders. and if
any one in the [[state]] of [[nature]] may punish another for any [[evil]] he has
done, every one may do so: for in that [[state]] of [[perfect]] equality, where
naturally there is no superiority or jurisdiction of one over another,
what any may do in prosecution of that [[law]], every one must needs have a
right to do.

sect. 8. and thus, in the [[state]] of [[nature]], one [[man]] comes by a [[power]] over
another; but yet no absolute or arbitrary [[power]], to use a [[criminal]], when
he has got him in his hands, according to the passionate heats, or
boundless extravagancy of his own will; but only to retribute to him, so
far as calm [[reason]] and [[conscience]] dictate, what is proportionate to his
transgression, which is so much as may serve for reparation and
restraint: for these two are the only reasons [[reason]], why one [[man]] may lawfully
do harm to another, which is that we call [[punishment]]. in transgressing
the [[law]] of [[nature]], the offender declares himself to [[live]] by another rule
than that of [[reason]] and [[common]] equity, which is that measure [[god]] has set
to the actions of [[men]], for their mutual security; and so he becomes
dangerous to [[mankind]], the tye, which is to secure them from injury and
violence, being slighted and broken by him. which being a trespass
against the whole [[species]], and the [[peace]] and safety of it, provided for
by the [[law]] of [[nature]], every [[man]] upon this score, by the [[right]] he hath to
preserve [[mankind]] in general, may restrain, or where it is necessary,
destroy things noxious to them, and so may bring such [[evil]] on any one,
who hath transgressed that [[law]], as may make him repent the doing of it,
and thereby deter him, and by his [[example]] others, from doing the like
mischief. and in the case, and upon this ground, every [[man]] hath a right
to punish the offender, and be executioner of the [[law]] of [[nature]].

sect. 9. i [[doubt]] not but this will seem a very [[strange]] doctrine to some
men: but before they condemn it, i [[desire]] them to resolve me, by what
right any [[prince]] or [[state]] can put to [[death]], or punish an alien, for any
crime he commits in their [[country]]. it is [[certain]] their laws [[law]], by virtue
of any sanction they receive from the promulgated will of the
legislative, reach not a stranger: they speak not to him, nor, if they
did, is he bound to hearken to them. the legislative [[authority]], by which
they are in [[force]] over the subjects [[subject]] of that commonwealth, hath no power
over him. those who have the supreme [[power]] of making laws [[law]] in [[england]],
france or holland, are to an [[indian]], but like the rest of the [[world]], men
without [[authority]]: and therefore, if by the [[law]] of [[nature]] every [[man]] hath
not a [[power]] to punish offences against it, as he soberly judges [[judge]] the case
to require, i see not how the magistrates of any [[community]] can punish an
alien of another [[country]]; since, in reference to him, they can have no
more [[power]] than what every [[man]] naturally may have over another.

sect, 10. besides the crime which consists in violating the [[law]], and
varying from the [[right]] [[rule]] of [[reason]], whereby a [[man]] so far becomes
degenerate, and declares himself to quit the principles [[principle]] of [[human]] [[nature]],
and to be a noxious creature, there is commonly injury done to some
person or other, and some other [[man]] receives damage by his
transgression: in which case he who hath received any damage, has,
besides the [[right]] of [[punishment]] [[common]] to him with other [[men]], a
particular [[right]] to seek reparation from him that has done it: and any
other [[person]], who finds it just, may also join with him that is injured,
and assist him in recovering from the offender so much as may make
satisfaction for the harm he has [[suffered]].

sect. 11. from these two distinct rights [[right]], the one of punishing the crime
for restraint, and preventing the like offence, which [[right]] of punishing
is in every [[body]]; the other of taking reparation, which belongs only to
the injured party, comes it to pass that the magistrate, who by being
magistrate hath the [[common]] [[right]] of punishing put into his hands, can
often, where the [[public]] [[good]] demands not the execution of the [[law]], remit
the [[punishment]] of [[criminal]] offences by his own [[authority]], but yet cannot
remit the satisfaction due to any private [[man]] for the damage he has
received. that, he who has [[suffered]] the damage has a [[right]] to demand in
his own name, and he alone can remit: the damnified [[person]] has this
power of appropriating to himself the goods [[good]] or service of the offender,
by [[right]] of self-preservation, as every [[man]] has a [[power]] to punish the
crime, to prevent its being committed again, by the [[right]] he has of
preserving all [[mankind]], and doing all reasonable things he can in order
to that end: and thus it is, that every [[man]], in the [[state]] of [[nature]], has
a [[power]] to kill a murderer, both to deter others from doing the like
injury, which no reparation can compensate, by the [[example]] of the
punishment that attends it from every [[body]], and also to secure [[men]] from
the attempts of a [[criminal]], who having renounced [[reason]], the [[common]] rule
and measure [[god]] hath given to [[mankind]], hath, by the [[unjust]] [[violence]] and
slaughter he hath committed upon one, declared [[war]] against all [[mankind]],
and therefore may be destroyed as a lion or a tyger, one of those wild
savage beasts, with whom [[men]] can have no [[society]] nor security: and upon
this is grounded that [[great]] [[law]] of [[nature]], whoso sheddeth man's [[man]] [[blood]],
by [[man]] shall his [[blood]] be shed. and cain was so fully convinced, that
every one had a [[right]] to [[destroy]] such a [[criminal]], that after the murder
of his [[brother]], he cries out, every one that findeth me, shall slay me;
so plain was it writ in the hearts [[heart]] of all [[mankind]].

sect. 12. by the same [[reason]] may a [[man]] in the [[state]] of [[nature]] punish the
lesser breaches of that [[law]]. it will perhaps be demanded, with [[death]]? i
answer, each transgression may be punished to that [[degree]], and with so
much severity, as will suffice to make it an ill bargain to the
offender, give him cause to repent, and terrify others from doing the
like. every offence, that can be committed in the [[state]] of [[nature]], may
in the [[state]] of [[nature]] be also punished equally, and as far forth as it
may, in a commonwealth: for though it would be besides my present
purpose, to enter here into the particulars of the [[law]] of [[nature]], or its
measures of [[punishment]]; yet, it is [[certain]] there is such a [[law]], and that
too, as intelligible and plain to a [[rational]] creature, and a studier of
that [[law]], as the positive laws [[law]] of commonwealths; nay, possibly plainer;
as much as [[reason]] is easier to be understood, than the fancies and
intricate contrivances of [[men]], following contrary and hidden interests
put into words; for so truly are a [[great]] part of the municipal laws [[law]] of
countries, which are only so far [[right]], as they are founded on the law
of [[nature]], by which they are to be regulated and interpreted.

sect. 13. to this [[strange]] doctrine, viz. that in the [[state]] of nature
every one has the executive [[power]] of the [[law]] of [[nature]], i [[doubt]] not but
it will be objected, that it is unreasonable for [[men]] to be judges [[judge]] in
their own cases, that self-love will make [[men]] partial to themselves and
their [[friends]]: and on the other side, that ill [[nature]], passion and
revenge will carry them too far in punishing others; and hence nothing
but confusion and disorder will [[follow]], and that therefore [[god]] hath
certainly appointed [[government]] to restrain the partiality and violence
of [[men]]. i easily grant, that civil [[government]] is the proper remedy for
the inconveniencies of the [[state]] of [[nature]], which must certainly be
great, where [[men]] may be judges [[judge]] in their own case, since it is easy to be
imagined, that he who was so [[unjust]] as to do his [[brother]] an injury, will
scarce be so just as to condemn himself for it: but i shall [[desire]] those
who make this objection, to [[remember]], that absolute monarchs are but
men; and if [[government]] is to be the remedy of those evils [[evil]], which
necessarily [[follow]] from men's being judges [[judge]] in their own cases, and the
state of [[nature]] is therefore not to be endured, i [[desire]] to [[know]] what
kind of [[government]] that is, and how much [[better]] it is than the state
of [[nature]], where one [[man]], commanding a multitude, has the [[liberty]] to be
judge in his own case, and may do to all his subjects [[subject]] whatever he
pleases, without the least [[liberty]] to any one to [[question]] or controul
those who execute his [[pleasure]]? and in whatsoever he doth, whether led
by [[reason]], mistake or passion, must be submitted to? much [[better]] it is
in the [[state]] of [[nature]], wherein [[men]] are not bound to submit to the
unjust will of another: and if he that judges [[judge]], judges [[judge]] amiss in his own,
or any other case, he is answerable for it to the rest of [[mankind]].

sect. 14. it is often [[asked]] as a mighty objection, where are, or ever
were there any [[men]] in such a [[state]] of [[nature]]? to which it may suffice as
an [[answer]] at [[present]], that since all princes [[prince]] and rulers of independent
governments all through the [[world]], are in a [[state]] of [[nature]], it is plain
the [[world]] never was, nor ever will be, without numbers of [[men]] in that
state. i have named all governors of independent communities [[community]], whether
they are, or are not, in league with others: for it is not every compact
that puts an end to the [[state]] of [[nature]] between [[men]], but only this one
of agreeing together mutually to enter into one [[community]], and make one
body [[politic]]; other promises, and compacts, [[men]] may make one with
another, and yet still be in the [[state]] of [[nature]]. the promises and
bargains for truck, &c. between the two [[men]] in the desert island,
mentioned by garcilasso de la vega, in his [[history]] of peru; or between a
swiss and an [[indian]], in the woods of [[america]], are binding to them,
though they are perfectly in a [[state]] of [[nature]], in reference to one
another: for [[truth]] and keeping of [[faith]] belongs to [[men]], as [[men]], and not
as members of [[society]].

sect. 15. to those that say, there were never any [[men]] in the [[state]] of
nature, i will not only oppose the [[authority]] of the judicious hooker,
eccl. pol. lib. i. sect. 10, where he says,

/#
     the laws [[law]] which have been hitherto mentioned, i.e. the laws [[law]] of
     [[nature]], do bind [[men]] absolutely, even as they are [[men]], although they
     have never any settled fellowship, never any solemn agreement
     amongst themselves what to do, or not to do: but forasmuch as we
     are not by ourselves sufficient to furnish ourselves with competent
     store of things, needful for such a [[life]] as our [[nature]] doth [[desire]],
     a [[life]] fit for the [[dignity]] of [[man]]; therefore to supply those
     defects and imperfections which are in us, as living [[single]] and
     solely by ourselves, we are naturally induced to seek communion and
     fellowship with others: this was the cause of men's uniting
     themselves at first in [[politic]] societies [[society]].


#/

but i moreover affirm, that all [[men]] are naturally in that [[state]], and
remain so, till by their own consents they make themselves members of
some [[politic]] [[society]]; and i [[doubt]] not in the sequel of this discourse,
to make it very clear.




chapter. iii.

of the [[state]] of [[war]].


sect. 16. the [[state]] of [[war]] is a [[state]] of enmity and destruction: and
therefore declaring by word or action, not a passionate and hasty, but a
sedate settled design upon another man's [[man]] [[life]], puts him in a [[state]] of
war with him against whom he has declared such an intention, and so has
exposed his [[life]] to the other's [[power]] to be taken away by him, or any
one that joins with him in his defence, and espouses his quarrel; it
being reasonable and just, i should have a [[right]] to [[destroy]] that which
threatens me with destruction: for, by the fundamental [[law]] of [[nature]],
man being to be preserved as much as possible, when all cannot be
preserved, the safety of the [[innocent]] is to be preferred: and one may
destroy a [[man]] who makes [[war]] upon him, or has discovered an enmity to his
being, for the same [[reason]] that he may kill a wolf or a lion; because
such [[men]] are not under the ties of the commonlaw of [[reason]], have no
other [[rule]], but that of [[force]] and [[violence]], and so may be treated as
beasts of prey, those dangerous and noxious creatures, that will be sure
to [[destroy]] him whenever he falls into their [[power]].

sect. 17. and hence it is, that he who attempts to get another [[man]] into
his absolute [[power]], does thereby put himself into a [[state]] of [[war]] with
him; it being to be understood as a declaration of a design upon his
life: for i have [[reason]] to conclude, that he who would get me into his
power without my [[consent]], would use me as he pleased when he had got me
there, and [[destroy]] me too when he had a fancy to it; for no [[body]] can
desire to have me in his absolute [[power]], unless it be to compel me by
force to that which is against the [[right]] of my [[freedom]], i.e. make me a
slave. to be [[free]] from such [[force]] is the only security of my
preservation; and [[reason]] bids me look on him, as an [[enemy]] to my
preservation, who would take away that [[freedom]] which is the fence to it;
so that he who makes an attempt to enslave me, thereby puts himself into
a [[state]] of [[war]] with me. he that, in the [[state]] of [[nature]], would take away
the [[freedom]] that belongs to any one in that [[state]], must necessarily be
supposed to have a design to take away every thing else, that freedom
being the foundation of all the rest; as he that, in the [[state]] of
society, would take away the [[freedom]] belonging to those of that society
or commonwealth, must be supposed to design to take away from them every
thing else, and so be looked on as in a [[state]] of [[war]].

sect. 18. this makes it lawful for a [[man]] to kill a thief, who has not in
the least hurt him, nor declared any design upon his [[life]], any farther
than, by the use of [[force]], so to get him in his [[power]], as to take away
his [[money]], or what he pleases, from him; because using [[force]], where he
has no [[right]], to get me into his [[power]], let his pretence be what it
will, i have no [[reason]] to suppose, that he, who would take away my
liberty, would not, when he had me in his [[power]], take away every thing
else. and therefore it is lawful for me to treat him as one who has put
himself into a [[state]] of [[war]] with me, i.e. kill him if i can; for to that
hazard does he justly expose himself, whoever introduces a [[state]] of [[war]],
and is aggressor in it.

sect. 19. and here we have the plain difference between the [[state]] of
nature and the [[state]] of [[war]], which however some [[men]] have confounded, are
as far distant, as a [[state]] of [[peace]], [[good]] will, mutual assistance and
preservation, and a [[state]] of enmity, malice, [[violence]] and mutual
destruction, are one from another. [[men]] living together according to
reason, without a [[common]] superior on [[earth]], with [[authority]] to judge
between them, is properly the [[state]] of [[nature]]. but [[force]], or a declared
design of [[force]], upon the [[person]] of another, where there is no common
superior on [[earth]] to appeal to for relief, is the [[state]] of [[war]]: and it
is the want of such an appeal gives a [[man]] the [[right]] of [[war]] even against
an aggressor, tho' he be in [[society]] and a fellow [[subject]]. thus a thief,
whom i cannot harm, but by appeal to the [[law]], for having stolen all that
i am worth, i may kill, when he sets on me to rob me but of my horse or
coat; because the [[law]], which was made for my preservation, where it
cannot interpose to secure my [[life]] from [[present]] [[force]], which, if lost,
is capable of no reparation, permits me my own defence, and the [[right]] of
war, a [[liberty]] to kill the aggressor, because the aggressor allows not
time to appeal to our [[common]] [[judge]], nor the decision of the [[law]], for
remedy in a case where the mischief may be irreparable. want of a common
judge with [[authority]], puts all [[men]] in a [[state]] of [[nature]]: [[force]] without
right, upon a man's [[man]] [[person]], makes a [[state]] of [[war]], both where there is,
and is not, a [[common]] [[judge]].

sect. 20. but when the actual [[force]] is over, the [[state]] of [[war]] ceases
between those that are in [[society]], and are equally on both sides
subjected to the [[fair]] determination of the [[law]]; because then there lies
open the remedy of appeal for the [[past]] injury, and to prevent future
harm: but where no such appeal is, as in the [[state]] of [[nature]], for want
of positive laws [[law]], and judges [[judge]] with [[authority]] to appeal to, the [[state]] of
war once begun, continues, with a [[right]] to the [[innocent]] party to destroy
the other whenever he can, until the aggressor offers [[peace]], and desires
reconciliation on such terms as may repair any wrongs [[wrong]] he has already
done, and secure the [[innocent]] for the future; nay, where an appeal to
the [[law]], and constituted judges [[judge]], lies [[lie]] open, but the remedy is denied by
a manifest perverting of [[justice]], and a barefaced wresting of the laws
to [[protect]] or indemnify the [[violence]] or injuries of some [[men]], or party
of [[men]], there it is hard to imagine any thing but a [[state]] of [[war]]: for
wherever [[violence]] is used, and injury done, though by hands appointed to
administer [[justice]], it is still [[violence]] and injury, however coloured
with the name, pretences, or forms of [[law]], the end whereof being to
protect and redress the [[innocent]], by an unbiassed application of it, to
all who are under it; wherever that is not bona fide done, [[war]] is made
upon the sufferers, who having no appeal on [[earth]] to [[right]] them, they
are left to the only remedy in such cases, an appeal to [[heaven]].

sect. 21. to avoid this [[state]] of [[war]] (wherein there is no appeal but to
heaven, and wherein every the least difference is apt to end, where
there is no [[authority]] to decide between the contenders) is one great
reason of men's putting themselves into [[society]], and quitting the state
of [[nature]]: for where there is an [[authority]], a [[power]] on [[earth]], from which
relief can be had by appeal, there the continuance of the [[state]] of war
is excluded, and the controversy is decided by that [[power]]. had there
been any such court, any superior jurisdiction on [[earth]], to determine
the [[right]] between jephtha and the ammonites, they had never come to a
state of [[war]]: but we see he was forced to appeal to [[heaven]]. the [[lord]] the
judge (says he) be [[judge]] this day between the [[children]] of [[israel]] and the
children of ammon, judg. xi. 27. and then prosecuting, and relying on
his appeal, he leads out his [[army]] to [[battle]]: and therefore in such
controversies, where the [[question]] is put, who shall be [[judge]]? it cannot
be meant, who shall decide the controversy; every one knows [[know]] what jephtha
here tells us, that the [[lord]] the [[judge]] shall [[judge]]. where there is no
judge on [[earth]], the appeal lies [[lie]] to [[god]] in [[heaven]]. that [[question]] then
cannot mean, who shall [[judge]], whether another hath put himself in a
state of [[war]] with me, and whether i may, as jephtha did, appeal to
heaven in it? of that i myself can only be [[judge]] in my own [[conscience]],
as i will [[answer]] it, at the [[great]] day, to the supreme [[judge]] of all [[men]].




chapter. iv.

of [[slavery]].


sect. 22. the [[natural]] [[liberty]] of [[man]] is to be [[free]] from any superior
power on [[earth]], and not to be under the will or legislative [[authority]] of
man, but to have only the [[law]] of [[nature]] for his [[rule]]. the [[liberty]] of
man, in [[society]], is to be under no other legislative [[power]], but that
established, by [[consent]], in the commonwealth; nor under the dominion of
any will, or restraint of any [[law]], but what that legislative shall
enact, according to the trust put in it. [[freedom]] then is not what sir
robert filmer tells us, observations, a. 55. a [[liberty]] for every one to
do what he lists, to [[live]] as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws [[law]]:
but [[freedom]] of [[men]] under [[government]] is, to have a standing [[rule]] to live
by, [[common]] to every one of that [[society]], and made by the legislative
power erected in it; a [[liberty]] to [[follow]] my own will in all things,
where the [[rule]] prescribes not; and not to be [[subject]] to the inconstant,
uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another [[man]]: as [[freedom]] of nature
is, to be under no other restraint but the [[law]] of [[nature]].

sect. 23. this [[freedom]] from absolute, arbitrary [[power]], is so necessary
to, and closely joined with a man's [[man]] preservation, that he cannot part
with it, but by what forfeits his preservation and [[life]] together: for a
man, not having the [[power]] of his own [[life]], cannot, by compact, or his
own [[consent]], enslave himself to any one, nor put himself under the
absolute, arbitrary [[power]] of another, to take away his [[life]], when he
pleases. no [[body]] can give more [[power]] than he has himself; and he that
cannot take away his own [[life]], cannot give another [[power]] over it.
indeed, having by his [[fault]] forfeited his own [[life]], by some act that
deserves [[death]]; he, to whom he has forfeited it, may (when he has him in
his power) delay to take it, and make use of him to his own service, and
he does him no injury by it: for, whenever he finds the hardship of his
slavery outweigh the value of his [[life]], it is in his [[power]], by resisting
the will of his master, to draw on himself the [[death]] he desires [[desire]].

sect. 24. this is the [[perfect]] condition of [[slavery]], which is nothing
else, but the [[state]] of [[war]] continued, between a lawful conqueror and a
captive: for, if once compact enter between them, and make an agreement
for a limited [[power]] on the one side, and [[obedience]] on the other, the
state of [[war]] and [[slavery]] ceases, as long as the compact endures: for, as
has been said, no [[man]] can, by agreement, pass over to another that which
he hath not in himself, a [[power]] over his own [[life]].

i confess, we find among the [[jews]], as well as other nations, that men
did sell themselves; but, it is plain, this was only to drudgery, not to
slavery: for, it is evident, the [[person]] sold was not under an absolute,
arbitrary, despotical [[power]]: for the master could not have [[power]] to kill
him, at any [[time]], whom, at a [[certain]] [[time]], he was obliged to let go free
out of his service; and the master of such a servant was so far from
having an arbitrary [[power]] over his [[life]], that he could not, at [[pleasure]],
so much as maim him, but the loss of an eye, or tooth, set him [[free]],
exod. xxi.




chapter. v.

of [[property]].


sect. 25. whether we consider [[natural]] [[reason]], which tells us, that [[men]],
being once born, have a [[right]] to their preservation, and consequently to
meat and drink, and such other things as [[nature]] affords for their
subsistence: or revelation, which gives us an account of those grants
god made of the [[world]] to adam, and to noah, and his sons [[son]], it is very
clear, that [[god]], as [[king]] [[david]] says, psal. cxv. 16. has given the earth
to the [[children]] of [[men]]; given it to [[mankind]] in [[common]]. but this being
supposed, it seems to some a very [[great]] difficulty, how any one should
ever come to have a [[property]] in any thing: i will not content myself to
answer, that if it be difficult to make out [[property]], upon a supposition
that [[god]] gave the [[world]] to adam, and his [[posterity]] in [[common]], it is
impossible that any [[man]], but one universal monarch, should have any
property upon a supposition, that [[god]] gave the [[world]] to adam, and his
heirs in succession, exclusive of all the rest of his [[posterity]]. but i
shall endeavour to shew, how [[men]] might come to have a [[property]] in
several parts of that which [[god]] gave to [[mankind]] in [[common]], and that
without any express compact of all the commoners.

sect. 26. [[god]], who hath given the [[world]] to [[men]] in [[common]], hath also
given them [[reason]] to make use of it to the [[best]] advantage of [[life]], and
convenience. the [[earth]], and all that is therein, is given to [[men]] for the
support and comfort of their being. and tho' all the fruits it naturally
produces, and beasts it feeds, belong to [[mankind]] in [[common]], as they are
produced by the spontaneous hand of [[nature]]; and no [[body]] has originally a
private dominion, exclusive of the rest of [[mankind]], in any of them, as
they are thus in their [[natural]] [[state]]: yet being given for the use of
men, there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some way or
other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any
particular [[man]]. the fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild [[indian]],
who knows [[know]] no enclosure, and is still a tenant in [[common]], must be his,
and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any
right to it, before it can do him any [[good]] for the support of his [[life]].

sect. 27. though the [[earth]], and all inferior creatures, be [[common]] to all
men, yet every [[man]] has a [[property]] in his own [[person]]: this no [[body]] has
any [[right]] to but himself. the [[labour]] of his [[body]], and the [[work]] of his
hands, we may say, are properly his. whatsoever then he removes out of
the [[state]] that [[nature]] hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his
labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby
makes it his [[property]]. it being by him removed from the [[common]] state
nature hath placed it in, it hath by this [[labour]] something annexed to
it, that excludes the [[common]] [[right]] of other [[men]]: for this [[labour]] being
the unquestionable [[property]] of the labourer, no [[man]] but he can have a
right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough,
and as [[good]], left in [[common]] for others.

sect. 28. he that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak,
or the apples he gathered from the trees in the wood, has certainly
appropriated them to himself. no [[body]] can deny but the nourishment is
his. i ask then, when did they begin to be his? when he digested? or
when he [[eat]]? or when he boiled? or when he brought them [[home]]? or when he
picked them up? and it is plain, if the first gathering made them not
his, nothing else could. that [[labour]] put a distinction between them and
common: that added something to them more than [[nature]], the [[common]] mother
of all, had done; and so they became his private [[right]]. and will any one
say, he had no [[right]] to those acorns or apples, he thus appropriated,
because he had not the [[consent]] of all [[mankind]] to make them his? was it a
robbery thus to assume to himself what belonged to all in [[common]]? if
such a [[consent]] as that was necessary, [[man]] had starved, notwithstanding
the plenty [[god]] had given him. we see in commons [[common]], which remain so by
compact, that it is the taking any part of what is [[common]], and removing
it out of the [[state]] [[nature]] leaves it in, which begins the [[property]];
without which the [[common]] is of no use. and the taking of this or that
part, does not depend on the express [[consent]] of all the commoners. thus
the grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant has cut; and the ore i
have digged in any place, where i have a [[right]] to them in [[common]] with
others, become my [[property]], without the assignation or [[consent]] of any
body. the [[labour]] that was mine, removing them out of that [[common]] state
they were in, hath fixed my [[property]] in them.

sect. 29. by making an explicit [[consent]] of every commoner, necessary to
any one's appropriating to himself any part of what is given in [[common]],
children or servants could not cut the meat, which their [[father]] or
master had provided for them in [[common]], without assigning to every one
his peculiar part. though the water running in the fountain be every
one's, yet who can [[doubt]], but that in the pitcher is his only who drew
it out? his [[labour]] hath taken it out of the hands of [[nature]], where it
was [[common]], and belonged equally to all her [[children]], and hath thereby
appropriated it to himself.

sect. 30. thus this [[law]] of [[reason]] makes the deer that indian's who hath
killed it; it is allowed to be his goods [[good]], who hath bestowed his labour
upon it, though before it was the [[common]] [[right]] of every one. and amongst
those who are counted the civilized part of [[mankind]], who have made and
multiplied positive laws [[law]] to determine [[property]], this original [[law]] of
nature, for the beginning of [[property]], in what was before [[common]], still
takes place; and by [[virtue]] thereof, what fish any one catches in the
ocean, that [[great]] and still remaining [[common]] of [[mankind]]; or what
ambergrise any one takes up here, is by the [[labour]] that removes it out
of that [[common]] [[state]] [[nature]] left it in, made his [[property]], who takes
that pains [[pain]] about it. and even amongst us, the hare that any one is
hunting, is [[thought]] his who pursues her during the chase: for being a
beast that is still looked upon as [[common]], and no man's [[man]] private
possession; whoever has employed so much [[labour]] about any of that [[kind]],
as to find and pursue her, has thereby removed her from the [[state]] of
nature, wherein she was [[common]], and hath begun a [[property]].

sect. 31. it will perhaps be objected to this, that if gathering the
acorns, or other fruits of the [[earth]], &c. makes a [[right]] to them, then
any one may ingross as much as he will. to which i [[answer]], not so. the
same [[law]] of [[nature]], that does by this means give us [[property]], does also
bound that [[property]] too. [[god]] has given us all things richly, 1 tim. vi.
12. is the voice of [[reason]] confirmed by inspiration. but how far has he
given it us? to enjoy. as much as any one can make use of to any
advantage of [[life]] before it spoils, so much he may by his [[labour]] fix a
property in: whatever is beyond this, is more than his share, and
belongs to others. nothing was made by [[god]] for [[man]] to spoil or [[destroy]].
and thus, considering the plenty of [[natural]] provisions there was a long
time in the [[world]], and the few spenders; and to how small a part of that
provision the industry of one [[man]] could extend itself, and ingross it to
the prejudice of others; especially keeping within the bounds, set by
reason, of what might serve for his use; there could be then little room
for quarrels or contentions about [[property]] so established.

sect. 32. but the [[chief]] matter of [[property]] being now not the fruits of
the [[earth]], and the beasts that subsist on it, but the [[earth]] itself; as
that which takes in and carries with it all the rest; i [[think]] it is
plain, that [[property]] in that too is acquired as the former. as much land
as a [[man]] tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product
of, so much is his [[property]]. he by his [[labour]] does, as it were, inclose
it from the [[common]]. nor will it invalidate his [[right]], to say every body
else has an [[equal]] title to it; and therefore he cannot appropriate, he
cannot inclose, without the [[consent]] of all his fellow-commoners, all
mankind. [[god]], when he gave the [[world]] in [[common]] to all [[mankind]], commanded
man also to [[labour]], and the penury of his condition required it of him.
god and his [[reason]] commanded him to subdue the [[earth]], i.e. improve it
for the benefit of [[life]], and therein lay out something upon it that was
his own, his [[labour]]. he that in [[obedience]] to this command of [[god]],
subdued, tilled and sowed any part of it, thereby annexed to it
something that was his [[property]], which another had no title to, nor
could without injury take from him.

sect. 33. nor was this appropriation of any parcel of [[land]], by improving
it, any prejudice to any other [[man]], since there was still enough, and as
good left; and more than the yet unprovided could use. so that, in
effect, there was never the less left for others because of his
enclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another can make
use of, does as [[good]] as take nothing at all. no [[body]] could [[think]] himself
injured by the drinking of another [[man]], though he took a [[good]] draught,
who had a whole river of the same water left him to quench his thirst:
and the case of [[land]] and water, where there is enough of both, is
perfectly the same.

sect. 34. [[god]] gave the [[world]] to [[men]] in [[common]]; but since he gave it them
for their benefit, and the [[greatest]] conveniencies of [[life]] they were
capable to draw from it, it cannot be supposed he meant it should always
remain [[common]] and uncultivated. he gave it to the use of the industrious
and [[rational]], (and [[labour]] was to be his title to it;) not to the fancy
or covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious. he that had as good
left for his improvement, as was already taken up, needed not [[complain]],
ought not to meddle with what was already improved by another's [[labour]]:
if he did, it is plain he [[desired]] the benefit of another's pains [[pain]], which
he had no [[right]] to, and not the ground which [[god]] had given him in common
with others to [[labour]] on, and whereof there was as [[good]] left, as that
already possessed, and more than he knew what to do with, or his
industry could reach to.

sect. 35. it is true, in [[land]] that is [[common]] in [[england]], or any other
country, where there is plenty of [[people]] under [[government]], who have
money and commerce, no one can inclose or appropriate any part, without
the [[consent]] of all his fellow-commoners; because this is left [[common]] by
compact, i.e. by the [[law]] of the [[land]], which is not to be violated. and
though it be [[common]], in [[respect]] of some [[men]], it is not so to all
mankind; but is the joint [[property]] of this [[country]], or this parish.
besides, the remainder, after such enclosure, would not be as [[good]] to
the rest of the commoners, as the whole was when they could all make use
of the whole; whereas in the beginning and first peopling of the great
common of the [[world]], it was quite otherwise. the [[law]] [[man]] was under, was
rather for appropriating. [[god]] commanded, and his wants forced him to
labour. that was his [[property]] which could not be taken from him
where-ever he had fixed it. and hence subduing or cultivating the [[earth]],
and having dominion, we see are joined together. the one gave title to
the other. so that [[god]], by commanding to subdue, gave [[authority]] so far
to appropriate: and the condition of [[human]] [[life]], which requires labour
and materials to [[work]] on, necessarily introduces private possessions.

sect. 36. the measure of [[property]] [[nature]] has well set by the extent of
men's [[labour]] and the conveniencies of [[life]]: no man's [[man]] [[labour]] could
subdue, or appropriate all; nor could his enjoyment consume more than a
small part; so that it was impossible for any [[man]], this way, to intrench
upon the [[right]] of another, or acquire to himself a [[property]], to the
prejudice of his neighbour, who would still have room for as [[good]], and
as large a possession (after the other had taken out his) as before it
was appropriated. this measure did confine every man's [[man]] possession to a
very moderate proportion, and such as he might appropriate to himself,
without injury to any [[body]], in the first ages [[age]] of the [[world]], when men
were more in danger to be lost, by wandering from their company, in the
then vast wilderness of the [[earth]], than to be straitened for want of
room to plant in. and the same measure may be allowed still without
prejudice to any [[body]], as full as the [[world]] seems: for supposing a [[man]],
or [[family]], in the [[state]] they were at first peopling of the [[world]] by the
children of adam, or noah; let him plant in some inland, vacant places
of [[america]], we shall find that the possessions he could make himself,
upon the measures we have given, would not be very large, nor, even to
this day, prejudice the rest of [[mankind]], or give them [[reason]] to
complain, or [[think]] themselves injured by this man's [[man]] incroachment, though
the [[race]] of [[men]] have now spread themselves to all the corners of the
world, and do infinitely exceed the small number was at the beginning.
nay, the extent of ground is of so little value, without [[labour]], that i
have heard it affirmed, that in [[spain]] itself a [[man]] may be permitted to
plough, sow and reap, without being disturbed, upon [[land]] he has no other
title to, but only his making use of it. but, on the contrary, the
inhabitants [[think]] themselves beholden to him, who, by his industry on
neglected, and consequently waste [[land]], has increased the stock of corn,
which they wanted. but be this as it will, which i lay no stress on;
this i dare boldly affirm, that the same [[rule]] of propriety, (viz.) that
every [[man]] should have as much as he could make use of, would hold still
in the [[world]], without straitening any [[body]]; since there is [[land]] enough
in the [[world]] to suffice double the inhabitants, had not the invention of
money, and the tacit agreement of [[men]] to put a value on it, introduced
(by consent) larger possessions, and a [[right]] to them; which, how it has
done, i shall by and by shew more at large.

sect. 37. this is [[certain]], that in the beginning, before the [[desire]] of
having more than [[man]] needed had altered the intrinsic value of things,
which depends only on their usefulness to the [[life]] of [[man]]; or had
agreed, that a little piece of yellow metal, which would keep without
wasting or decay, should be worth a [[great]] piece of flesh, or a whole
heap of corn; though [[men]] had a [[right]] to appropriate, by their [[labour]],
each one of himself, as much of the things of [[nature]], as he could use:
yet this could not be much, nor to the prejudice of others, where the
same plenty was still left to those who would use the same industry. to
which let me add, that he who appropriates [[land]] to himself by his
labour, does not lessen, but increase the [[common]] stock of [[mankind]]: for
the provisions serving to the support of [[human]] [[life]], produced by one
acre of inclosed and cultivated [[land]], are (to speak much within compass)
ten times [[time]] more than those which are yielded by an acre of [[land]] of an
equal richness lying waste in [[common]]. and therefore he that incloses
land, and has a greater plenty of the conveniencies of [[life]] from ten
acres, than he could have from an hundred left to [[nature]], may truly be
said to give ninety acres to [[mankind]]: for his [[labour]] now supplies him
with provisions out of ten acres, which were but the product of an
hundred lying in [[common]]. i have here rated the improved [[land]] very low,
in making its product but as ten to one, when it is much nearer an
hundred to one: for i ask, whether in the wild woods and uncultivated
waste of [[america]], left to [[nature]], without any improvement, tillage or
husbandry, a thousand acres yield the needy and wretched inhabitants as
many conveniencies of [[life]], as ten acres of equally fertile [[land]] do in
devonshire, where they are well cultivated?

before the appropriation of [[land]], he who gathered as much of the wild
fruit, killed, caught, or tamed, as many of the beasts, as he could; he
that so imployed his pains [[pain]] about any of the spontaneous products of
nature, as any way to alter them from the [[state]] which [[nature]] put them
in, by placing any of his [[labour]] on them, did thereby acquire a
propriety in them: but if they perished, in his possession, without
their due use; if the fruits rotted, or the venison putrified, before he
could spend it, he offended against the [[common]] [[law]] of [[nature]], and was
liable to be punished; he invaded his neighbour's share, for he had no
right, farther than his use called for any of them, and they might serve
to afford him conveniencies of [[life]].

sect. 38. the same measures governed the possession of [[land]] too:
whatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use of, before it
spoiled, that was his peculiar [[right]]; whatsoever he enclosed, and could
feed, and make use of, the cattle and product was also his. but if
either the grass of his enclosure rotted on the ground, or the fruit of
his planting perished without gathering, and laying up, this part of the
earth, notwithstanding his enclosure, was still to be looked on as
waste, and might be the possession of any other. thus, at the beginning,
cain might take as much ground as he could till, and make it his own
land, and yet leave enough to abel's sheep to feed on; a few acres would
serve for both their possessions. but as families [[family]] increased, and
industry inlarged their stocks, their possessions inlarged with the need
of them; but yet it was commonly without any fixed [[property]] in the
ground they made use of, till they incorporated, settled themselves
together, and built cities [[city]]; and then, by [[consent]], they came in [[time]], to
set out the bounds of their distinct territories, and agree on limits
between them and their neighbours; and by laws [[law]] within themselves,
settled the properties [[property]] of those of the same [[society]]: for we see, that in
that part of the [[world]] which was first inhabited, and therefore like to
be [[best]] peopled, even as low down as abraham's [[time]], they wandered with
their flocks, and their herds, which was their substance, freely up and
down; and this [[abraham]] did, in a [[country]] where he was a stranger. whence
it is plain, that at least a [[great]] part of the [[land]] lay in [[common]]; that
the inhabitants valued it not, nor claimed [[property]] in any more than
they made use of. but when there was not room enough in the same place,
for their herds to feed together, they by [[consent]], as [[abraham]] and lot
did, gen. xiii. 5. separated and inlarged their pasture, where it best
liked them. and for the same [[reason]] esau went from his [[father]], and his
brother, and planted in mount seir, gen. xxxvi. 6.

sect. 39. and thus, without supposing any private dominion, and property
in adam, over all the [[world]], exclusive of all other [[men]], which can no
way be proved, nor any one's [[property]] be made out from it; but supposing
the [[world]] given, as it was, to the [[children]] of [[men]] in [[common]], we see how
labour could make [[men]] distinct titles to several parcels of it, for
their private uses; wherein there could be no [[doubt]] of [[right]], no room
for quarrel.

sect. 40. nor is it so [[strange]], as perhaps before consideration it may
appear, that the [[property]] of [[labour]] should be able to over-balance the
community of [[land]]: for it is [[labour]] indeed that puts the difference of
value on every thing; and let any one consider what the difference is
between an acre of [[land]] planted with tobacco or sugar, sown with wheat
or barley, and an acre of the same [[land]] lying in [[common]], without any
husbandry upon it, and he will find, that the improvement of labour
makes the far greater part of the value. i [[think]] it will be but a very
modest computation to say, that of the products of the [[earth]] useful to
the [[life]] of [[man]] nine tenths are the effects of [[labour]]: nay, if we will
rightly estimate things as they come to our use, and cast up the several
expences about them, what in them is purely owing to [[nature]], and what to
labour, we shall find, that in most of them ninety-nine hundredths are
wholly to be put on the account of [[labour]].

sect. 41. there cannot be a clearer demonstration of any thing, than
several nations of the americans are of this, who are [[rich]] in [[land]], and
poor in all the comforts of [[life]]; whom [[nature]] having furnished as
liberally as any other [[people]], with the materials of plenty, i.e. a
fruitful soil, apt to [[produce]] in abundance, what might serve for food,
raiment, and delight; yet for want of improving it by [[labour]], have not
one hundredth part of the conveniencies we enjoy: and a [[king]] of a large
and fruitful territory there, feeds, lodges, and is clad worse than a
day-labourer in [[england]].

sect. 42. to make this a little clearer, let us but trace some of the
ordinary provisions of [[life]], through their several progresses, before
they come to our use, and see how much they receive of their value from
human industry. bread, wine and cloth, are things of daily use, and
great plenty; yet notwithstanding, acorns, water and leaves, or skins,
must be our bread, drink and cloathing, did not [[labour]] furnish us with
these more useful commodities: for whatever bread is more worth than
acorns, wine than water, and cloth or silk, than leaves, skins or moss,
that is wholly owing to [[labour]] and industry; the one of these being the
food and raiment which unassisted [[nature]] furnishes us with; the other,
provisions which our industry and pains [[pain]] prepare for us, which how much
they exceed the other in value, when any one hath computed, he will then
see how much [[labour]] makes the far [[greatest]] part of the value of things
we enjoy in this [[world]]: and the ground which produces [[produce]] the materials, is
scarce to be reckoned in, as any, or at most, but a very small part of
it; so little, that even amongst us, [[land]] that is left wholly to [[nature]],
that hath no improvement of pasturage, tillage, or planting, is called,
as indeed it is, waste; and we shall find the benefit of it amount to
little more than nothing.

this shews how much numbers of [[men]] are to be preferred to largeness of
dominions; and that the increase of lands [[land]], and the [[right]] employing of
them, is the [[great]] art [[arts]] of [[government]]: and that [[prince]], who shall be so
wise and godlike, as by established laws [[law]] of [[liberty]] to secure protection
and encouragement to the honest industry of [[mankind]], against the
oppression of [[power]] and narrowness of party, will quickly be too hard
for his neighbours: but this by the by.

to return to the argument in hand.

sect. 43. an acre of [[land]], that bears here twenty bushels of wheat, and
another in [[america]], which, with the same husbandry, would do the like,
are, without [[doubt]], of the same [[natural]] intrinsic value: but yet the
benefit [[mankind]] receives from the one in a year, is worth 5l. and from
the other possibly not worth a penny, if all the [[profit]] an indian
received from it were to be valued, and sold here; at least, i may truly
say, not one thousandth. it is [[labour]] then which puts the [[greatest]] part
of value upon [[land]], without which it would scarcely be worth any thing:
it is to that we owe the [[greatest]] part of all its useful products; for
all that the straw, bran, bread, of that acre of wheat, is more worth
than the product of an acre of as [[good]] [[land]], which lies [[lie]] waste, is all
the effect of [[labour]]: for it is not barely the plough-man's pains [[pain]], the
reaper's and thresher's toil, and the baker's sweat, is to be counted
into the bread we [[eat]]; the [[labour]] of those who broke the oxen, who
digged and wrought the iron and stones, who felled and framed the timber
employed about the plough, mill, oven, or any other utensils, which are
a vast number, requisite to this corn, from its being feed to be sown to
its being made bread, must all be charged on the account of [[labour]], and
received as an effect of that: [[nature]] and the [[earth]] furnished only the
almost worthless materials, as in themselves. it would be a strange
catalogue of things, that industry provided and made use of, about every
loaf of bread, before it came to our use, if we could trace them; iron,
wood, leather, bark, timber, stone, bricks, coals, lime, cloth, dying
drugs, pitch, tar, masts, ropes, and all the materials made use of in
the ship, that brought any of the commodities made use of by any of the
workmen, to any part of the [[work]]; all which it would be almost
impossible, at least too long, to reckon up.

sect. 44. from all which it is evident, that though the things of nature
are given in [[common]], yet [[man]], by being master of himself, and proprietor
of his own [[person]], and the actions or [[labour]] of it, had still in himself
the [[great]] foundation of [[property]]; and that, which made up the [[great]] part
of what he applied to the support or comfort of his being, when
invention and [[arts]] had improved the conveniencies of [[life]], was perfectly
his own, and did not belong in [[common]] to others.

sect. 45. thus [[labour]], in the beginning, gave a [[right]] of [[property]],
wherever any one was pleased to employ it upon what was [[common]], which
remained a long while the far greater part, and is yet more than mankind
makes use of. [[men]], at first, for the most part, contented themselves
with what unassisted [[nature]] offered to their necessities: and though
afterwards, in some parts of the [[world]], (where the increase of people
and stock, with the use of [[money]], had made [[land]] scarce, and so of some
value) the several communities [[community]] settled the bounds of their distinct
territories, and by laws [[law]] within themselves regulated the properties [[property]] of
the private [[men]] of their [[society]], and so, by compact and agreement,
settled the [[property]] which [[labour]] and industry began; and the leagues
that have been made between several states and kingdoms [[kingdom]], either expresly
or tacitly disowning all claim and [[right]] to the [[land]] in the others
possession, have, by [[common]] [[consent]], given up their pretences to their
natural [[common]] [[right]], which originally they had to those countries [[country]], and
so have, by positive agreement, settled a [[property]] amongst themselves,
in distinct parts and parcels of the [[earth]]; yet there are still great
tracts of ground to be found, which (the inhabitants thereof not having
joined with the rest of [[mankind]], in the [[consent]] of the use of their
common money) [[lie]] waste, and are more than the [[people]] who dwell on it
do, or can make use of, and so still [[lie]] in [[common]]; tho' this can scarce
happen amongst that part of [[mankind]] that have consented to the use of
money.

sect. 46. the [[greatest]] part of things really useful to the [[life]] of [[man]],
and such as the necessity of subsisting made the first commoners of the
world look after, as it doth the americans now, are generally things of
short duration; such as, if they are not consumed by use, will decay and
perish of themselves: gold, silver and diamonds, are things that fancy
or agreement hath put the value on, more than real use, and the
necessary support of [[life]]. now of those [[good]] things which [[nature]] hath
provided in [[common]], every one had a [[right]] (as hath been said) to as much
as he could use, and [[property]] in all that he could effect with his
labour; all that his industry could extend to, to alter from the state
nature had put it in, was his. he that gathered a hundred bushels of
acorns or apples, had thereby a [[property]] in them, they were his goods [[good]] as
soon as gathered. he was only to look, that he used them before they
spoiled, else he took more than his share, and robbed others. and indeed
it was a foolish thing, as well as dishonest, to hoard up more than he
could make use of. if he gave away a part to any [[body]] else, so that it
perished not uselesly in his possession, these he also made use of. and
if he also bartered away plums, that would have rotted in a week, for
nuts that would [[last]] [[good]] for his eating a whole year, he did no injury;
he wasted not the [[common]] stock; destroyed no part of the portion of
goods that belonged to others, so long as nothing perished uselesly in
his hands. again, if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal,
pleased with its colour; or exchange his sheep for shells, or wool for a
sparkling pebble or a diamond, and keep those by him all his [[life]] he
invaded not the [[right]] of others, he might heap up as much of these
durable things as he pleased; the exceeding of the bounds of his just
property not lying in the largeness of his possession, but the perishing
of any thing uselesly in it.

sect. 47. and thus came in the use of [[money]], some lasting thing that men
might keep without spoiling, and that by mutual [[consent]] [[men]] would take
in exchange for the truly useful, but perishable supports of [[life]].

sect. 48. and as different degrees [[degree]] of industry were apt to give men
possessions in different proportions, so this invention of [[money]] gave
them the opportunity to continue and enlarge them: for supposing an
island, separate from all possible commerce with the rest of the [[world]],
wherein there were but an hundred families [[family]], but there were sheep, horses
and cows, with other useful animals, wholsome fruits, and [[land]] enough
for corn for a hundred thousand times [[time]] as many, but nothing in the
island, either because of its commonness, or perishableness, fit to
supply the place of [[money]]; what [[reason]] could any one have there to
enlarge his possessions beyond the use of his [[family]], and a plentiful
supply to its consumption, either in what their own industry produced,
or they could barter for like perishable, useful commodities, with
others? where there is not some thing, both lasting and scarce, and so
valuable to be hoarded up, there [[men]] will not be apt to enlarge their
possessions of [[land]], were it never so [[rich]], never so [[free]] for them to
take: for i ask, what would a [[man]] value ten thousand, or an hundred
thousand acres of excellent [[land]], ready cultivated, and well stocked too
with cattle, in the middle of the inland parts of [[america]], where he had
no hopes [[hope]] of commerce with other parts of the [[world]], to draw [[money]] to him
by the sale of the product? it would not be worth the enclosing, and we
should see him give up again to the wild [[common]] of [[nature]], whatever was
more than would supply the conveniencies of [[life]] to be had there for him
and his [[family]].

sect. 49. thus in the beginning all the [[world]] was [[america]], and more so
than that is now; for no such thing as [[money]] was any where known. find
out something that hath the use and value of [[money]] amongst his
neighbours, you shall see the same [[man]] will begin presently to enlarge
his possessions.

sect. 50. but since gold and silver, being little useful to the [[life]] of
man in proportion to food, raiment, and carriage, has its value only
from the [[consent]] of [[men]], whereof [[labour]] yet makes, in [[great]] part, the
measure, it is plain, that [[men]] have agreed to a disproportionate and
unequal possession of the [[earth]], they having, by a tacit and voluntary
consent, found out, a way how a [[man]] may fairly possess more [[land]] than he
himself can use the product of, by receiving in exchange for the
overplus gold and silver, which may be hoarded up without injury to any
one; these metals not spoiling or decaying in the hands of the
possessor. this partage of things in an inequality of private
possessions, [[men]] have made practicable out of the bounds of [[society]], and
without compact, only by putting a value on gold and silver, and tacitly
agreeing in the use of [[money]]: for in governments [[government]], the laws [[law]] regulate the
right of [[property]], and the possession of [[land]] is determined by positive
constitutions.

sect. 51. and thus, i [[think]], it is very easy to conceive, without any
difficulty, how [[labour]] could at first begin a title of [[property]] in the
common things of [[nature]], and how the spending it upon our uses bounded
it. so that there could then be no [[reason]] of quarrelling about title,
nor any [[doubt]] about the largeness of possession it gave. [[right]] and
conveniency went together; for as a [[man]] had a [[right]] to all he could
employ his [[labour]] upon, so he had no temptation to [[labour]] for more than
he could make use of. this left no room for controversy about the title,
nor for encroachment on the [[right]] of others; what portion a [[man]] carved
to himself, was easily seen; and it was useless, as well as dishonest,
to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed.




chapter. vi.

of paternal [[power]].


sect. 52. it may perhaps be censured as an impertinent criticism, in a
discourse of this [[nature]], to find [[fault]] with words and names, that have
obtained in the [[world]]: and yet possibly it may not be amiss to offer new
ones, when the old are apt to lead [[men]] into mistakes, as this of
paternal [[power]] probably has done, which seems so to place the [[power]] of
parents over their [[children]] wholly in the [[father]], as if the [[mother]] had
no share in it; whereas, if we consult [[reason]] or revelation, we shall
find, she hath an [[equal]] title. this may give one [[reason]] to ask, whether
this might not be more properly called parental [[power]]? for whatever
obligation [[nature]] and the [[right]] of [[generation]] lays on [[children]], it must
certainly bind them [[equal]] to both the concurrent causes of it. and
accordingly we see the positive [[law]] of [[god]] every where joins them
together, without distinction, when it commands the [[obedience]] of
children, [[honour]] thy [[father]] and thy [[mother]], exod. xx. 12. whosoever
curseth his [[father]] or his [[mother]], lev. xx. 9. ye shall [[fear]] every man
his [[mother]] and his [[father]], lev. xix. 3. [[children]], obey your parents, &c.
eph. vi. 1. is the stile of the old and new testament.

sect. 53. had but this one thing been well considered, without looking
any deeper into the matter, it might perhaps have kept [[men]] from running
into those gross mistakes, they have made, about this [[power]] of parents;
which, however it might, without any [[great]] harshness, bear the name of
absolute dominion, and regal [[authority]], when under the title of paternal
power it seemed appropriated to the [[father]], would yet have founded but
oddly, and in the very name shewn the absurdity, if this supposed
absolute [[power]] over [[children]] had been called parental; and thereby have
discovered, that it belonged to the [[mother]] too: for it will but very ill
serve the turn of those [[men]], who contend so much for the absolute power
and [[authority]] of the fatherhood, as they call it, that the [[mother]] should
have any share in it; and it would have but ill supported the monarchy
they contend for, when by the very name it appeared, that that
fundamental [[authority]], from whence they would derive their [[government]] of
a [[single]] [[person]] only, was not placed in one, but two persons [[person]] jointly.
but to let this of names pass.

sect. 54. though i have said above, chap. ii. that all [[men]] by [[nature]] are
equal, i cannot be supposed to [[understand]] all sorts of equality: [[age]] or
virtue may give [[men]] a just precedency: excellency of parts and [[merit]] may
place others above the [[common]] level: birth may [[subject]] some, and
alliance or benefits others, to [[pay]] an observance to those to whom
nature, gratitude, or other respects [[respect]], may have made it due: and yet all
this consists with the equality, which all [[men]] are in, in [[respect]] of
jurisdiction or dominion one over another; which was the equality i
there spoke of, as proper to the [[business]] in hand, being that equal
right, that every [[man]] hath, to his [[natural]] [[freedom]], without being
subjected to the will or [[authority]] of any other [[man]].

sect. 55. [[children]], i confess, are not born in this full [[state]] of
equality, though they are born to it. their parents have a sort of rule
and jurisdiction over them, when they come into the [[world]], and for some
time after; but it is but a temporary one. the bonds of this subjection
are like the swaddling clothes they are wrapt up in, and supported by,
in the weakness of their infancy: [[age]] and [[reason]] as they grow up, loosen
them, till at length they drop quite off, and leave a [[man]] at his own
free disposal.

sect. 56. adam was created a [[perfect]] [[man]], his [[body]] and [[mind]] in full
possession of their [[strength]] and [[reason]], and so was capable, from the
first instant of his being to provide for his own support and
preservation, and govern his actions according to the dictates of the
law of [[reason]] which [[god]] had implanted in him. from him the [[world]] is
peopled with his descendants, who are all born infants, [[weak]] and
helpless, without [[knowledge]] or understanding: but to supply the defects
of this imperfect [[state]], till the improvement of [[growth]] and [[age]] hath
removed them, adam and eve, and after them all parents were, by the law
of [[nature]], under an obligation to preserve, nourish, and educate the
children they had begotten; not as their own workmanship, but the
workmanship of their own maker, the almighty, to whom they were to be
accountable for them.

sect. 57. the [[law]], that was to govern adam, was the same that was to
govern all his [[posterity]], the [[law]] of [[reason]]. but his offspring having
another way of entrance into the [[world]], different from him, by a natural
birth, that produced them ignorant and without the use of [[reason]], they
were not presently under that [[law]]; for no [[body]] can be under a [[law]], which
is not promulgated to him; and this [[law]] being promulgated or made known
by [[reason]] only, he that is not come to the use of his [[reason]], cannot be
said to be under this [[law]]; and adam's [[children]], being not presently as
soon as born under this [[law]] of [[reason]], were not presently [[free]]: for [[law]],
in its true notion, is not so much the limitation as the direction of a
free and [[intelligent]] agent to his proper interest, and prescribes no
farther than is for the general [[good]] of those under that [[law]]: could they
be happier without it, the [[law]], as an useless thing, would of itself
vanish; and that ill deserves the name of confinement which hedges us in
only from bogs and precipices. so that, however it may be mistaken, the
end of [[law]] is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge
freedom: for in all the states of created beings capable of laws [[law]], where
there is no [[law]], there is no [[freedom]]: for [[liberty]] is, to be [[free]] from
restraint and [[violence]] from others; which cannot be, where there is no
law: but [[freedom]] is not, as we are told, a [[liberty]] for every [[man]] to do
what he lists: (for who could be [[free]], when every other man's [[man]] humour
might domineer over him?) but a [[liberty]] to dispose, and order as he
lists, his [[person]], actions, possessions, and his whole [[property]], within
the allowance of those laws [[law]] under which he is, and therein not to be
subject to the arbitrary will of another, but freely [[follow]] his own.

sect. 58. the [[power]], then, that parents have over their [[children]], arises
from that [[duty]] which is incumbent on them, to take [[care]] of their
off-spring, during the imperfect [[state]] of [[childhood]]. to inform the [[mind]],
and govern the actions of their yet ignorant nonage, till [[reason]] shall
take its place, and ease them of that trouble, is what the children
want, and the parents are bound to: for [[god]] having given [[man]] an
understanding to direct his actions, has allowed him a [[freedom]] of will,
and [[liberty]] of acting, as properly belonging thereunto, within the
bounds of that [[law]] he is under. but whilst he is in an estate, wherein
he has not understanding of his own to direct his will, he is not to
have any will of his own to [[follow]]: he that understands for him, must
will for him too; he must prescribe to his will, and regulate his
actions; but when he comes to the estate that made his [[father]] a freeman,
the [[son]] is a freeman too.

sect. 59. this holds in all the laws [[law]] a [[man]] is under, whether [[natural]] or
civil. is a [[man]] under the [[law]] of [[nature]]? what made him [[free]] of that [[law]]?
what gave him a [[free]] disposing of his [[property]], according to his own
will, within the compass of that [[law]]? i [[answer]], a [[state]] of maturity
wherein he might be supposed capable to [[know]] that [[law]], that so he might
keep his actions within the bounds of it. when he has acquired that
state, he is presumed to [[know]] how far that [[law]] is to be his guide, and
how far he may make use of his [[freedom]], and so comes to have it; till
then, some [[body]] else must guide him, who is presumed to [[know]] how far the
law allows a [[liberty]]. if such a [[state]] of [[reason]], such an [[age]] of
discretion made him [[free]], the same shall make his [[son]] [[free]] too. is a man
under the [[law]] of [[england]]? what made him [[free]] of that [[law]]? that is, to
have the [[liberty]] to dispose of his actions and possessions according to
his own will, within the permission of that [[law]]? a capacity of knowing
that [[law]]; which is supposed by that [[law]], at the [[age]] of one and twenty
years, and in some cases sooner. if this made the [[father]] [[free]], it shall
make the [[son]] [[free]] too. till then we see the [[law]] allows the [[son]] to have
no will, but he is to be guided by the will of his [[father]] or guardian,
who is to [[understand]] for him. and if the [[father]] [[die]], and fail to
substitute a deputy in his trust; if he hath not provided a tutor, to
govern his [[son]], during his minority, during his want of understanding,
the [[law]] takes [[care]] to do it; some other must govern him, and be a will
to him, till he hath attained to a [[state]] of [[freedom]], and his
understanding be fit to take the [[government]] of his will. but after that,
the [[father]] and [[son]] are equally [[free]] as much as tutor and pupil after
nonage; equally subjects [[subject]] of the same [[law]] together, without any dominion
left in the [[father]] over the [[life]], [[liberty]], or estate of his [[son]], whether
they be only in the [[state]] and under the [[law]] of [[nature]], or under the
positive laws [[law]] of an established [[government]].

sect. 60. but if, through defects that may happen out of the ordinary
course of [[nature]], any one comes not to such a [[degree]] of [[reason]], wherein
he might be supposed capable of knowing the [[law]], and so living within
the rules [[rule]] of it, he is never capable of being a [[free]] [[man]], he is never
let loose to the disposure of his own will (because he knows [[know]] no bounds
to it, has not understanding, its proper guide) but is continued under
the tuition and [[government]] of others, all the [[time]] his own understanding
is uncapable of that charge. and so lunatics and ideots are never set
free from the [[government]] of their parents;

/#
     [[children]], who are not as yet come unto those years whereat they may
     have; and innocents which are excluded by a [[natural]] defect from
     ever having; thirdly, madmen, which for the [[present]] cannot possibly
     have the use of [[right]] [[reason]] to guide themselves, have for their
     guide, the [[reason]] that guideth other [[men]] which are tutors over
     them, to seek and procure their [[good]] for them,
#/

says hooker, eccl. pol. lib. i. sec. 7. all which seems no more than
that [[duty]], which [[god]] and [[nature]] has laid on [[man]], as well as other
creatures, to preserve their offspring, till they can be able to shift
for themselves, and will scarce amount to an instance or proof of
parents regal [[authority]].

sect. 61. thus we are born [[free]], as we are born [[rational]]; not that we
have actually the exercise of either: [[age]], that brings one, brings with
it the other too. and thus we see how [[natural]] [[freedom]] and subjection to
parents may consist together, and are both founded on the same
principle. a child is [[free]] by his father's title, by his father's
understanding, which is to govern him till he hath it of his own. the
freedom of a [[man]] at years of discretion, and the subjection of a child
to his parents, whilst yet short of that [[age]], are so consistent, and so
distinguishable, that the most blinded contenders for [[monarchy]], by right
of fatherhood, cannot miss this difference; the most obstinate cannot
but allow their consistency: for were their doctrine all true, were the
right heir of adam now known, and by that title settled a monarch in his
throne, invested with all the absolute unlimited [[power]] sir robert filmer
talks of; if he should [[die]] as soon as his heir were born, must not the
child, notwithstanding he were never so [[free]], never so much [[sovereign]],
be in subjection to his [[mother]] and nurse, to tutors and governors, till
age and [[education]] brought him [[reason]] and ability to govern himself and
others? the necessities of his [[life]], the health of his [[body]], and the
information of his [[mind]], would require him to be directed by the will of
others, and not his own; and yet will any one [[think]], that this restraint
and subjection were inconsistent with, or spoiled him of that [[liberty]] or
sovereignty he had a [[right]] to, or gave away his [[empire]] to those who had
the [[government]] of his nonage? this [[government]] over him only prepared him
the [[better]] and sooner for it. if any [[body]] should ask me, when my [[son]] is
of [[age]] to be [[free]]? i shall [[answer]], just when his monarch is of [[age]] to
govern. but at what [[time]], says the judicious hooker, eccl. pol. l. i.
sect. 6. a [[man]] may be said to have attained so far forth the use of
reason, as sufficeth to make him capable of those laws [[law]] whereby he is
then bound to guide his actions: this is a [[great]] deal more easy for
sense to discern, than for any one by [[skill]] and learning to determine.

sect. 62. common-wealths themselves take notice of, and allow, that
there is a [[time]] when [[men]] are to begin to act like [[free]] [[men]], and
therefore till that [[time]] require not oaths of fealty, or allegiance, or
other [[public]] owning of, or submission to the [[government]] of their
countries.

sect. 63. the [[freedom]] then of [[man]], and [[liberty]] of acting according to
his own will, is grounded on his having [[reason]], which is able to
instruct him in that [[law]] he is to govern himself by, and make him know
how far he is left to the [[freedom]] of his own will. to turn him loose to
an unrestrained [[liberty]], before he has [[reason]] to guide him, is not the
allowing him the [[privilege]] of his [[nature]] to be [[free]]; but to thrust him
out amongst brutes, and abandon him to a [[state]] as wretched, and as much
beneath that of a [[man]], as their's. this is that which puts the authority
into the parents hands to govern the minority of their [[children]]. god
hath made it their [[business]] to employ this [[care]] on their offspring, and
hath placed in them suitable inclinations of tenderness and concern to
temper this [[power]], to apply it, as his [[wisdom]] designed it, to the
children's [[good]], as long as they should need to be under it.

sect. 64. but what [[reason]] can hence advance this [[care]] of the parents due
to their off-spring into an absolute arbitrary dominion of the [[father]],
whose [[power]] reaches no farther, than by such a discipline, as he finds
most effectual, to give such [[strength]] and health to their bodies [[body]], such
vigour and rectitude to their minds [[mind]], as may [[best]] fit his [[children]] to be
most useful to themselves and others; and, if it be necessary to his
condition, to make them [[work]], when they are able, for their own
subsistence. but in this [[power]] the [[mother]] too has her share with the
father.

sect. 65. nay, this [[power]] so little belongs to the [[father]] by any
peculiar [[right]] of [[nature]], but only as he is guardian of his [[children]],
that when he quits his [[care]] of them, he loses his [[power]] over them, which
goes along with their nourishment and [[education]], to which it is
inseparably annexed; and it belongs as much to the foster-father of an
exposed child, as to the [[natural]] [[father]] of another. so little [[power]] does
the bare act of begetting give a [[man]] over his issue; if all his care
ends there, and this be all the title he hath to the name and authority
of a [[father]]. and what will become of this paternal [[power]] in that part of
the [[world]], where one woman hath more than one husband at a [[time]]? or in
those parts of [[america]], where, when the husband and [[wife]] part, which
happens frequently, the [[children]] are all left to the [[mother]], [[follow]] her,
and are wholly under her [[care]] and provision? if the [[father]] [[die]] whilst
the [[children]] are [[young]], do they not naturally every where owe the same
obedience to their [[mother]], during their minority, as to their father
were he alive? and will any one say, that the [[mother]] hath a legislative
power over her [[children]]? that she can make standing rules [[rule]], which shall
be of perpetual obligation, by which they ought to regulate all the
concerns of their [[property]], and bound their [[liberty]] all the course of
their lives [[life]]? or can she inforce the observation of them with capital
punishments? for this is the proper [[power]] of the magistrate, of which
the [[father]] hath not so much as the shadow. his command over his children
is but temporary, and reaches not their [[life]] or [[property]]: it is but a
help to the weakness and imperfection of their nonage, a discipline
necessary to their [[education]]: and though a [[father]] may dispose of his own
possessions as he pleases, when his [[children]] are out of danger of
perishing for want, yet his [[power]] extends not to the lives [[life]] or goods [[good]],
which either their own industry, or another's bounty has made their's;
nor to their [[liberty]] neither, when they are once arrived to the
infranchisement of the years of discretion. the father's [[empire]] then
ceases, and he can from thence forwards no more dispose of the liberty
of his [[son]], than that of any other [[man]]: and it must be far from an
absolute or perpetual jurisdiction, from which a [[man]] may withdraw
himself, having license from [[divine]] [[authority]] to leave [[father]] and
mother, and cleave to his [[wife]].

sect. 66. but though there be a [[time]] when a child comes to be as free
from subjection to the will and command of his [[father]], as the father
himself is [[free]] from subjection to the will of any [[body]] else, and they
are each under no other restraint, but that which is [[common]] to them
both, whether it be the [[law]] of [[nature]], or municipal [[law]] of their
country; yet this [[freedom]] exempts not a [[son]] from that [[honour]] which he
ought, by the [[law]] of [[god]] and [[nature]], to [[pay]] his parents. [[god]] having made
the parents instruments in his [[great]] design of continuing the [[race]] of
mankind, and the occasions [[occasion]] of [[life]] to their [[children]]; as he hath laid on
them an obligation to nourish, preserve, and bring up their offspring;
so he has laid on the [[children]] a perpetual obligation of honouring their
parents, which containing in it an inward esteem and reverence to be
shewn by all outward expressions, ties up the child from any thing that
may ever injure or affront, disturb or endanger, the [[happiness]] or life
of those from whom he received his; and engages him in all actions of
defence, relief, assistance and comfort of those, by whose means he
entered into being, and has been made capable of any enjoyments of [[life]]:
from this obligation no [[state]], no [[freedom]] can absolve [[children]]. but this
is very far from giving parents a [[power]] of command over their [[children]],
or an [[authority]] to make laws [[law]] and dispose as they please of their lives
or liberties [[liberty]]. it is one thing to owe [[honour]], [[respect]], gratitude and
assistance; another to require an absolute [[obedience]] and submission. the
honour due to parents, a monarch in his [[throne]] owes his [[mother]]; and yet
this lessens not his [[authority]], nor subjects [[subject]] him to her [[government]].

sect. 67. the subjection of a minor places in the [[father]] a temporary
government, which terminates with the minority of the child: and the
honour due from a child, places in the parents a perpetual [[right]] to
respect, reverence, support and compliance too, more or less, as the
father's [[care]], cost, and [[kindness]] in his [[education]], has been more or
less. this ends not with minority, but holds in all parts and conditions
of a man's [[man]] [[life]]. the want of distinguishing these two powers [[power]], viz. that
which the [[father]] hath in the [[right]] of tuition, during minority, and the
right of [[honour]] all his [[life]], may perhaps have caused a [[great]] part of
the mistakes about this matter: for to speak properly of them, the first
of these is rather the [[privilege]] of [[children]], and [[duty]] of parents, than
any prerogative of paternal [[power]]. the nourishment and [[education]] of
their [[children]] is a charge so incumbent on parents for their children's
good, that nothing can absolve them from taking [[care]] of it: and though
the [[power]] of commanding and chastising them go along with it, yet god
hath woven into the principles [[principle]] of [[human]] [[nature]] such a tenderness for
their off-spring, that there is little [[fear]] that parents should use
their [[power]] with too much rigour; the excess is seldom on the severe
side, the [[strong]] byass of [[nature]] drawing the other way. and therefore
god almighty when he would express his gentle dealing with the
israelites, he tells them, that though he chastened them, he chastened
them as a [[man]] chastens his [[son]], deut. viii. 5. i.e. with tenderness and
affection, and kept them under no severer discipline than what was
absolutely [[best]] for them, and had been less [[kindness]] to have slackened.
this is that [[power]] to which [[children]] are commanded [[obedience]], that the
pains and [[care]] of their parents may not be increased, or ill rewarded.

sect. 68. on the other side, [[honour]] and support, all that which
gratitude requires to return for the benefits received by and from them,
is the indispensable [[duty]] of the child, and the proper [[privilege]] of the
parents. this is intended for the parents advantage, as the other is for
the child's; though [[education]], the parents [[duty]], seems to have most
power, because the ignorance and infirmities of [[childhood]] stand in need
of restraint and correction; which is a visible exercise of [[rule]], and a
kind of dominion. and that [[duty]] which is comprehended in the word
honour, requires less [[obedience]], though the obligation be stronger on
grown, than younger [[children]]: for who can [[think]] the command, children
obey your parents, requires in a [[man]], that has [[children]] of his own, the
same submission to his [[father]], as it does in his yet [[young]] [[children]] to
him; and that by this precept he were bound to obey all his father's
commands, if, out of a conceit of [[authority]], he should have the
indiscretion to treat him still as a boy?

sect. 69. the first part then of paternal [[power]], or rather [[duty]], which
is [[education]], belongs so to the [[father]], that it terminates at a certain
season; when the [[business]] of [[education]] is over, it ceases of itself, and
is also alienable before: for a [[man]] may put the tuition of his [[son]] in
other hands; and he that has made his [[son]] an apprentice to another, has
discharged him, during that [[time]], of a [[great]] part of his [[obedience]] both
to himself and to his [[mother]]. but all the [[duty]] of [[honour]], the other
part, remains never the less entire to them; nothing can cancel that: it
is so inseparable from them both, that the father's [[authority]] cannot
dispossess the [[mother]] of this [[right]], nor can any [[man]] discharge his son
from honouring her that bore him. but both these are very far from a
power to make laws [[law]], and enforcing them with penalties, that may reach
estate, [[liberty]], limbs and [[life]]. the [[power]] of commanding ends with
nonage; and though, after that, [[honour]] and [[respect]], support and defence,
and whatsoever gratitude can oblige a [[man]] to, for the highest benefits
he is naturally capable of, be always due from a [[son]] to his parents; yet
all this puts no scepter into the father's hand, no [[sovereign]] [[power]] of
commanding. he has no dominion over his son's [[property]], or actions; nor
any [[right]], that his will should prescribe to his son's in all things;
however it may become his [[son]] in many things, not very inconvenient to
him and his [[family]], to [[pay]] a deference to it.

sect. 70. a [[man]] may owe [[honour]] and [[respect]] to an ancient, or [[wise]] [[man]];
defence to his child or friend; relief and support to the distressed;
and gratitude to a benefactor, to such a [[degree]], that all he has, all he
can do, cannot sufficiently [[pay]] it: but all these give no [[authority]], no
right to any one, of making laws [[law]] over him from whom they are owing. and
it is plain, all this is due not only to the bare title of [[father]]; not
only because, as has been said, it is owing to the [[mother]] too; but
because these obligations to parents, and the degrees [[degree]] of what is
required of [[children]], may be varied by the different [[care]] and [[kindness]],
trouble and expence, which is often employed upon one child more than
another.

sect. 71. this shews the [[reason]] how it comes to pass, that parents in
societies, where they themselves are subjects [[subject]], retain a [[power]] over their
children, and have as much [[right]] to their subjection, as those who are
in the [[state]] of [[nature]]. which could not possibly be, if all political
power were only paternal, and that in [[truth]] they were one and the same
thing: for then, all paternal [[power]] being in the [[prince]], the subject
could naturally have none of it. but these two powers [[power]], [[political]] and
paternal, are so perfectly distinct and separate; are built upon so
different foundations, and given to so different ends, that every
subject that is a [[father]], has as much a paternal [[power]] over his
children, as the [[prince]] has over his: and every [[prince]], that has
parents, owes them as much filial [[duty]] and [[obedience]], as the meanest of
his subjects [[subject]] do to their's; and can therefore contain not any part or
degree of that [[kind]] of dominion, which a [[prince]] or magistrate has over
his [[subject]].

sect. 72. though the obligation on the parents to bring up their
children, and the obligation on [[children]] to [[honour]] their parents,
contain all the [[power]] on the one hand, and submission on the other,
which are proper to this relation, yet there is another [[power]] ordinarily
in the [[father]], whereby he has a tie on the [[obedience]] of his [[children]];
which tho' it be [[common]] to him with other [[men]], yet the occasions [[occasion]] of
shewing it, almost constantly happening to fathers [[father]] in
their private families [[family]], and the instances of it elsewhere being rare,
and less taken notice of, it passes in the [[world]] for a part of paternal
jurisdiction. and this is the [[power]] [[men]] generally have to bestow their
estates on those who please them [[best]]; the possession of the father
being the expectation and [[inheritance]] of the [[children]], ordinarily in
certain proportions, according to the [[law]] and custom of each [[country]];
yet it is commonly in the father's [[power]] to bestow it with a more
sparing or liberal hand, according as the behaviour of this or that
child hath comported with his will and [[humour]].

sect. 73. this is no small tie on the [[obedience]] of [[children]]: and there
being always annexed to the enjoyment of [[land]], a submission to the
government of the [[country]], of which that [[land]] is a part; it has been
commonly supposed, that a [[father]] could oblige his [[posterity]] to that
government, of which he himself was a [[subject]], and that his compact held
them; whereas, it being only a necessary condition annexed to the [[land]],
and the [[inheritance]] of an estate which is under that [[government]], reaches
only those who will take it on that condition, and so is no [[natural]] tie
or engagement, but a voluntary submission: for every man's [[man]] children
being by [[nature]] as [[free]] as himself, or any of his [[ancestors]] ever were,
may, whilst they are in that [[freedom]], choose what [[society]] they will join
themselves to, what commonwealth they will put themselves under. but if
they will enjoy the [[inheritance]] of their [[ancestors]], they must take it on
the same terms their [[ancestors]] had it, and submit to all the conditions
annexed to such a possession. by this [[power]] indeed fathers [[father]] oblige their
children to [[obedience]] to themselves, even when they are [[past]] minority,
and most commonly too [[subject]] them to this or that [[political]] [[power]]: but
neither of these by any peculiar [[right]] of fatherhood, but by the reward
they have in their hands to inforce and recompence such a compliance;
and is no more [[power]] than what a french [[man]] has over an english [[man]], who
by the hopes [[hope]] of an estate he will leave him, will certainly have a
strong tie on his [[obedience]]: and if, when it is left him, he will enjoy
it, he must certainly take it upon the conditions annexed to the
possession of [[land]] in that [[country]] where it lies [[lie]], whether it be france
or [[england]].

sect. 74. to conclude then, tho' the father's [[power]] of commanding
extends no farther than the minority of his [[children]], and to a degree
only fit for the discipline and [[government]] of that [[age]]; and tho' that
honour and [[respect]], and all that which the latins called piety, which
they indispensably owe to their parents all their life-time, and in all
estates, with all that support and defence is due to them, gives the
father no [[power]] of governing, i.e. making laws [[law]] and enacting penalties on
his [[children]]; though by all this he has no dominion over the [[property]] or
actions of his [[son]]: yet it is obvious to conceive how easy it was, in
the first ages [[age]] of the [[world]], and in places still, where the thinness of
people gives families [[family]] leave to separate into unpossessed quarters, and
they have room to remove or plant themselves in yet vacant habitations,
for the [[father]] of the [[family]] to become the [[prince]] of it;* he had been a
ruler from the beginning of the infancy of his [[children]]: and since
without some [[government]] it would be hard for them to [[live]] together, it
was likeliest it should, by the express or tacit [[consent]] of the children
when they were grown up, be in the [[father]], where it seemed without any
change barely to continue; when indeed nothing more was required to it,
than the permitting the [[father]] to exercise alone, in his [[family]], that
executive [[power]] of the [[law]] of [[nature]], which every [[free]] [[man]] naturally
hath, and by that permission resigning up to him a monarchical [[power]],
whilst they remained in it. but that this was not by any paternal [[right]],
but only by the [[consent]] of his [[children]], is evident from hence, that no
body doubts [[doubt]], but if a stranger, whom [[chance]] or [[business]] had brought to
his [[family]], had there killed any of his [[children]], or committed any other
fact, he might condemn and put him to [[death]], or other-wise have punished
him, as well as any of his [[children]]; which it was impossible he should
do by [[virtue]] of any paternal [[authority]] over one who was not his child,
but by [[virtue]] of that executive [[power]] of the [[law]] of [[nature]], which, as a
man, he had a [[right]] to: and he alone could punish him in his [[family]],
where the [[respect]] of his [[children]] had laid by the exercise of such a
power, to give way to the [[dignity]] and [[authority]] they were willing should
remain in him, above the rest of his [[family]].

(*it is no improbable [[opinion]] therefore, which the archphilosopher was
of, that the [[chief]] [[person]] in every houshold was always, as it were, a
king: so when numbers of housholds joined themselves in civil societies
together, kings [[king]] were the first [[kind]] of governors amongst them, which is
also, as it seemeth, the [[reason]] why the name of fathers [[father]] continued still
in them, who, of fathers [[father]], were made rulers; as also the ancient custom
of governors to do as melchizedec, and being kings [[king]], to exercise the
office of priests [[priest]], which fathers [[father]] did at the first, grew perhaps by the
same [[occasion]]. howbeit, this is not the only [[kind]] of regiment that has
been received in the [[world]]. the inconveniences of one [[kind]] have caused
sundry others to be devised; so that in a word, all [[public]] regiment, of
what [[kind]] soever, seemeth evidently to have risen from the deliberate
advice, consultation and composition between [[men]], judging it convenient
and behoveful; there being no impossibility in [[nature]] considered by
itself, but that [[man]] might have lived without any [[public]] regiment,
hooker's eccl. pol. lib. i. sect. 10.)

sect. 75. thus it was easy, and almost [[natural]] for [[children]], by a tacit,
and scarce avoidable [[consent]], to make way for the father's [[authority]] and
government. they had been accustomed in their [[childhood]] to [[follow]] his
direction, and to refer their little differences to him, and when they
were [[men]], who fitter to [[rule]] them? their little properties [[property]], and less
covetousness, seldom afforded greater controversies; and when any should
arise, where could they have a fitter umpire than he, by whose [[care]] they
had every one been sustained and brought up, and who had a tenderness
for them all? it is no wonder that they made no distinction betwixt
minority and full [[age]]; nor looked after one and twenty, or any other age
that might make them the [[free]] disposers of themselves and fortunes [[fortune]], when
they could have no [[desire]] to be out of their pupilage: the government
they had been under, during it, continued still to be more their
protection than restraint; and they could no where find a greater
security to their [[peace]], liberties [[liberty]], and fortunes [[fortune]], than in the [[rule]] of a
father.

sect. 76. thus the [[natural]] fathers [[father]] of families [[family]], by an insensible [[change]],
became the [[politic]] monarchs of them too: and as they chanced to live
long, and leave able and worthy heirs, for several successions, or
otherwise; so they laid the foundations of hereditary, or elective
kingdoms, under several constitutions [[constitution]] and manners, according as [[chance]],
contrivance, or occasions [[occasion]] happened to mould them. but if princes [[prince]] have
their titles in their fathers [[father]] [[right]], and it be a sufficient proof of the
natural [[right]] of fathers [[father]] to [[political]] [[authority]], because they commonly
were those in whose hands we find, de facto, the exercise of [[government]]:
i say, if this argument be [[good]], it will as strongly prove, that all
princes, nay princes [[prince]] only, ought to be priests [[priest]], since it is as [[certain]],
that in the beginning, the [[father]] of the [[family]] was [[priest]], as that he
was ruler in his own houshold.




chapter. vii.

of [[political]] or civil [[society]].


sect. 77. [[god]] having made [[man]] such a creature, that in his own [[judgment]],
it was not [[good]] for him to be alone, put him under [[strong]] obligations of
necessity, convenience, and inclination to drive him into [[society]], as
well as fitted him with understanding and [[language]] to continue and enjoy
it. the first [[society]] was between [[man]] and [[wife]], which gave beginning to
that between parents and [[children]]; to which, in [[time]], that between
master and servant came to be added: and though all these might, and
commonly did meet together, and make up but one [[family]], wherein the
master or mistress of it had some sort of [[rule]] proper to a [[family]]; each
of these, or all together, came short of [[political]] [[society]], as we shall
see, if we consider the different ends, ties, and bounds of each of
these.

sect. 78. conjugal [[society]] is made by a voluntary compact between man
and woman; and tho' it consist chiefly in such a communion and [[right]] in
one another's bodies [[body]] as is necessary to its [[chief]] end, procreation; yet
it draws with it mutual support and assistance, and a communion of
interests too, as necessary not only to unite their [[care]] and affection,
but also necessary to their [[common]] off-spring, who have a [[right]] to be
nourished, and maintained by them, till they are able to provide for
themselves.

sect. 79. for the end of conjunction, between male and female, being not
barely procreation, but the continuation of the [[species]]; thisconjunction
betwixt male and female ought to [[last]], even after procreation, so long
as is necessary to the nourishment and support of the [[young]] ones, who
are to be sustained by those that got them, till they are able to shift
and provide for themselves. this [[rule]], which the infinite [[wise]] maker
hath set to the works [[work]] of his hands, we find the inferior creatures
steadily obey. in those viviparous animals which feed on grass, the
conjunction between male and female lasts no longer than the very act of
copulation; because the teat of the dam being sufficient to nourish the
young, till it be able to feed on grass, the male only begets, but
concerns not himself for the female or [[young]], to whose sustenance he can
contribute nothing. but in beasts of prey the conjunction lasts longer:
because the dam not being able well to subsist herself, and nourish her
numerous off-spring by her own prey alone, a more laborious, as well as
more dangerous way of living, than by feeding on grass, the assistance
of the male is necessary to the maintenance of their [[common]] [[family]],
which cannot subsist till they are able to prey for themselves, but by
the joint [[care]] of male and female. the same is to be observed in all
birds, (except some domestic ones, where plenty of food excuses the cock
from feeding, and taking [[care]] of the [[young]] brood) whose [[young]] needing
food in the nest, the cock and hen continue mates, till the [[young]] are
able to use their wing, and provide for themselves.

sect. 80. and herein i [[think]] lies [[lie]] the [[chief]], if not the only [[reason]], why
the male and female in [[mankind]] are tied to a longer conjunction than
other creatures, viz. because the female is capable of conceiving, and
de facto is commonly with child again, and brings forth too a new birth,
long before the former is out of a dependency for support on his parents
help, and able to shift for himself, and has all the assistance is due
to him from his parents: whereby the [[father]], who is bound to take care
for those he hath begot, is under an obligation to continue in conjugal
society with the same woman longer than other creatures, whose young
being able to subsist of themselves, before the [[time]] of procreation
returns again, the conjugal bond dissolves of itself, and they are at
liberty, till hymen at his usual anniversary season summons them again
to chuse new mates. wherein one cannot but [[admire]] the [[wisdom]] of the
great creator, who having given to [[man]] foresight, and an ability to lay
up for the future, as well as to supply the [[present]] necessity, hath made
it necessary, that [[society]] of [[man]] and [[wife]] should be more lasting, than
of male and female amongst other creatures; that so their industry might
be encouraged, and their interest [[better]] [[united]], to make provision and
lay up goods [[good]] for their [[common]] issue, which uncertain mixture, or easy
and frequent solutions of conjugal [[society]] would mightily disturb.

sect. 81. but tho' these are ties upon [[mankind]], which make the conjugal
bonds more firm and lasting in [[man]], than the other [[species]] of animals;
yet it would give one [[reason]] to enquire, why this compact, where
procreation and [[education]] are secured, and [[inheritance]] taken [[care]] for,
may not be made determinable, either by [[consent]], or at a [[certain]] [[time]],
or upon [[certain]] conditions, as well as any other voluntary compacts,
there being no necessity in the [[nature]] of the thing, nor to the ends of
it, that it should always be for [[life]]; i mean, to such as are under no
restraint of any positive [[law]], which ordains all such contracts to be
perpetual.

sect. 82. but the husband and [[wife]], though they have but one common
concern, yet having different understandings, will unavoidably sometimes
have different wills too; it therefore being necessary that the last
determination, i. e. the [[rule]], should be placed somewhere; it naturally
falls to the man's [[man]] share, as the abler and the stronger. but this
reaching but to the things of their [[common]] interest and [[property]], leaves
the [[wife]] in the full and [[free]] possession of what by contract is her
peculiar [[right]], and gives the husband no more [[power]] over her [[life]] than
she has over his; the [[power]] of the husband being so far from that of an
absolute monarch, that the [[wife]] has in many cases a [[liberty]] to separate
from him, where [[natural]] [[right]], or their contract allows it; whether that
contract be made by themselves in the [[state]] of [[nature]], or by the customs
or laws [[law]] of the [[country]] they [[live]] in; and the [[children]] upon such
separation fall to the [[father]] or mother's lot, as such contract does
determine.

sect. 83. for all the ends of [[marriage]] being to be obtained under
politic [[government]], as well as in the [[state]] of [[nature]], the civil
magistrate doth not abridge the [[right]] or [[power]] of either naturally
necessary to those ends, viz. procreation and mutual support and
assistance whilst they are together; but only decides any controversy
that may arise between [[man]] and [[wife]] about them. if it were otherwise,
and that absolute sovereignty and [[power]] of [[life]] and [[death]] naturally
belonged to the husband, and were necessary to the [[society]] between man
and [[wife]], there could be no matrimony in any of those countries [[country]] where
the husband is allowed no such absolute [[authority]]. but the ends of
matrimony requiring no such [[power]] in the husband, the condition of
conjugal [[society]] put it not in him, it being not at all necessary to
that [[state]]. conjugal [[society]] could subsist and attain its ends without
it; nay, [[community]] of goods [[good]], and the [[power]] over them, mutual assistance
and maintenance, and other things belonging to conjugal [[society]], might
be varied and regulated by that contract which unites [[man]] and [[wife]] in
that [[society]], as far as may consist with procreation and the bringing up
of [[children]] till they could shift for themselves; nothing being
necessary to any [[society]], that is not necessary to the ends for which it
is made.

sect. 84. the [[society]] betwixt parents and [[children]], and the distinct
rights and powers [[power]] belonging respectively to them, i have treated of so
largely, in the foregoing [[chapter]], that i shall not here need to say any
thing of it. and i [[think]] it is plain, that it is far different from a
politic [[society]].

sect. 85. master and servant are names as old as [[history]], but given to
those of far different condition; for a freeman makes himself a servant
to another, by selling him, for a [[certain]] [[time]], the service he
undertakes to do, in exchange for wages he is to receive: and though
this commonly puts him into the [[family]] of his master, and under the
ordinary discipline thereof; yet it gives the master but a temporary
power over him, and no greater than what is contained in the contract
between them. but there is another sort of servants, which by a peculiar
name we call slaves [[slave]], who being captives taken in a just [[war]], are by the
right of [[nature]] subjected to the absolute dominion and arbitrary power
of their masters. these [[men]] having, as i say, forfeited their lives [[life]], and
with it their liberties [[liberty]], and lost their estates; and being in the state
of [[slavery]], not capable of any [[property]], cannot in that [[state]] be
considered as any part of civil [[society]]; the [[chief]] end whereof is the
preservation of [[property]].

sect. 86. let us therefore consider a master of a [[family]] with all these
subordinate relations of [[wife]], [[children]], servants, and slaves [[slave]], united
under the domestic [[rule]] of a [[family]]; which, what resemblance soever it
may have in its order, offices, and number too, with a little
commonwealth, yet is very far from it, both in its [[constitution]], power
and end: or if it must be [[thought]] a [[monarchy]], and the paterfamilias the
absolute monarch in it, absolute [[monarchy]] will have but a very shattered
and short [[power]], when it is plain, by what has been said before, that
the master of the [[family]] has a very distinct and differently limited
power, both as to [[time]] and extent, over those several persons [[person]] that are
in it; for excepting the [[slave]] (and the [[family]] is as much a [[family]], and
his [[power]] as paterfamilias as [[great]], whether there be any slaves [[slave]] in his
family or no) he has no legislative [[power]] of [[life]] and [[death]] over any of
them, and none too but what a mistress of a [[family]] may have as well as
he. and he certainly can have no absolute [[power]] over the whole [[family]],
who has but a very limited one over every [[individual]] in it. but how a
family, or any other [[society]] of [[men]], differ from that which is properly
political [[society]], we shall [[best]] see, by considering wherein political
society itself consists.

sect. 87. [[man]] being born, as has been proved, with a title to perfect
freedom, and an uncontrouled enjoyment of all the rights [[right]] and privileges
of the [[law]] of [[nature]], equally with any other [[man]], or number of [[men]] in
the [[world]], hath by [[nature]] a [[power]], not only to preserve his [[property]],
that is, his [[life]], [[liberty]] and estate, against the injuries and attempts
of other [[men]]; but to [[judge]] of, and punish the breaches of that [[law]] in
others, as he is persuaded the offence deserves, even with [[death]] itself,
in crimes where the heinousness of the [[fact]], in his [[opinion]], requires
it. but because no [[political]] [[society]] can be, nor subsist, without having
in itself the [[power]] to preserve the [[property]], and in order thereunto,
punish the offences of all those of that [[society]]; there, and there only
is [[political]] [[society]], where every one of the members hath quitted this
natural [[power]], resigned it up into the hands of the [[community]] in all
cases that exclude him not from appealing for protection to the law
established by it. and thus all private [[judgment]] of every particular
member being excluded, the [[community]] comes to be umpire, by settled
standing rules [[rule]], indifferent, and the same to all parties; and by men
having [[authority]] from the [[community]], for the execution of those rules [[rule]],
decides all the differences that may happen between any members of that
society concerning any matter of [[right]]; and punishes those offences
which any member hath committed against the [[society]], with such penalties
as the [[law]] has established: whereby it is easy to discern, who are, and
who are not, in [[political]] [[society]] together. those who are [[united]] into
one [[body]], and have a [[common]] established [[law]] and judicature to appeal to,
with [[authority]] to decide controversies between them, and punish
offenders, are in civil [[society]] one with another: but those who have no
such [[common]] appeal, i mean on [[earth]], are still in the [[state]] of [[nature]],
each being, where there is no other, [[judge]] for himself, and executioner;
which is, as i have before shewed it, the [[perfect]] [[state]] of [[nature]].

sect. 88. and thus the commonwealth comes by a [[power]] to set down what
punishment shall belong to the several transgressions which they think
worthy of it, committed amongst the members of that [[society]], (which is
the [[power]] of making laws) as well as it has the [[power]] to punish any
injury done unto any of its members, by any one that is not of it,
(which is the [[power]] of [[war]] and [[peace]];) and all this for the preservation
of the [[property]] of all the members of that [[society]], as far as is
possible. but though every [[man]] who has entered into civil [[society]], and
is become a member of any commonwealth, has thereby quitted his [[power]] to
punish offences, against the [[law]] of [[nature]], in prosecution of his own
private [[judgment]], yet with the [[judgment]] of offences, which he has given
up to the legislative in all cases, where he can appeal to the
magistrate, he has given a [[right]] to the commonwealth to employ his
force, for the execution of the judgments [[judgment]] of the commonwealth, whenever
he shall be called to it; which indeed are his own judgments [[judgment]], they being
made by himself, or his representative. and herein we have the original
of the legislative and executive [[power]] of civil [[society]], which is to
judge by standing laws [[law]], how far offences are to be punished, when
committed within the commonwealth; and also to determine, by occasional
judgments founded on the [[present]] circumstances of the [[fact]], how far
injuries from without are to be vindicated; and in both these to employ
all the [[force]] of all the members, when there shall be need.

sect. 89. where-ever therefore any number of [[men]] are so [[united]] into one
society, as to quit every one his executive [[power]] of the [[law]] of [[nature]],
and to resign it to the [[public]], there and there only is a [[political]], or
civil [[society]]. and this is done, where-ever any number of [[men]], in the
state of [[nature]], enter into [[society]] to make one [[people]], one body
politic, under one supreme [[government]]; or else when any one joins
himself to, and incorporates with any [[government]] already made: for
hereby he authorizes the [[society]], or which is all one, the legislative
thereof, to make laws [[law]] for him, as the [[public]] [[good]] of the [[society]] shall
require; to the execution whereof, his own assistance (as to his own
decrees) is due. and this puts [[men]] out of a [[state]] of [[nature]] into that of
a commonwealth, by setting up a [[judge]] on [[earth]], with [[authority]] to
determine all the controversies, and redress the injuries that may
happen to any member of the commonwealth; which [[judge]] is the
legislative, or magistrates appointed by it. and where-ever there are
any number of [[men]], however associated, that have no such decisive power
to appeal to, there they are still in the [[state]] of [[nature]].

sect. 90. hence it is evident, that absolute [[monarchy]], which by some men
is counted the only [[government]] in the [[world]], is indeed inconsistent with
civil [[society]], and so can be no form of civil-government at all: for the
end of civil [[society]], being to avoid, and remedy those inconveniencies
of the [[state]] of [[nature]], which necessarily [[follow]] from every man's [[man]] being
judge in his own case, by setting up a known [[authority]], to which every
one of that [[society]] may appeal upon any injury received, or controversy
that may arise, and which every one of the [[society]] ought to obey;*
where-ever any persons [[person]] are, who have not such an [[authority]] to appeal to,
for the decision of any difference between them, there those persons [[person]] are
still in the [[state]] of [[nature]]; and so is every absolute [[prince]], in
respect of those who are under his dominion.

(*the [[public]] [[power]] of all [[society]] is above every [[soul]] contained in the
same [[society]]; and the principal use of that [[power]] is, to give laws [[law]] unto
all that are under it, which laws [[law]] in such cases we must obey, unless
there be [[reason]] shewed which may necessarily inforce, that the [[law]] of
reason, or of [[god]], doth enjoin the contrary, hook. eccl. pol. l. i.
sect. 16.)

sect. 91. for he being supposed to have all, both legislative and
executive [[power]] in himself alone, there is no [[judge]] to be found, no
appeal lies [[lie]] open to any one, who may fairly, and indifferently, and with
authority decide, and from whose decision relief and redress may be
expected of any injury or inconviency, that may be [[suffered]] from the
prince, or by his order: so that such a [[man]], however intitled, czar, or
grand seignior, or how you please, is as much in the [[state]] of [[nature]],
with all under his dominion, as he is with the rest of [[mankind]]: for
where-ever any two [[men]] are, who have no standing [[rule]], and [[common]] judge
to appeal to on [[earth]], for the determination of controversies of right
betwixt them, there they are still in the [[state]] of* [[nature]], and under
all the inconveniencies of it, with only this woful difference to the
subject, or rather [[slave]] of an absolute [[prince]]: that whereas, in the
ordinary [[state]] of [[nature]], he has a [[liberty]] to [[judge]] of his [[right]], and
according to the [[best]] of his [[power]], to maintain it; now, whenever his
property is invaded by the will and order of his monarch, he has not
only no appeal, as those in [[society]] ought to have, but as if he were
degraded from the [[common]] [[state]] of [[rational]] creatures, is denied a
liberty to [[judge]] of, or to defend his [[right]]; and so is exposed to all
the misery and inconveniencies, that a [[man]] can [[fear]] from one, who being
in the unrestrained [[state]] of [[nature]], is yet corrupted with [[flattery]], and
armed with [[power]].

(*to take away all such mutual grievances, injuries and wrongs [[wrong]], i.e.
such as attend [[men]] in the [[state]] of [[nature]], there was no way but only by
growing into composition and agreement amongst themselves, by ordaining
some [[kind]] of govemment [[public]], and by yielding themselves subject
thereunto, that unto whom they granted [[authority]] to [[rule]] and govem, by
them the [[peace]], tranquillity and [[happy]] estate of the rest might be
procured. [[men]] always knew that where [[force]] and injury was offered, they
might be defenders of themselves; they knew that however [[men]] may seek
their own commodity, yet if this were done with injury unto others, it
was not to be [[suffered]], but by all [[men]], and all [[good]] means to be
withstood. finally, they knew that no [[man]] might in [[reason]] take upon him
to determine his own [[right]], and according to his own determination
proceed in maintenance thereof, in as much as every [[man]] is towards
himself, and them whom he greatly affects, partial; and therefore that
strifes and troubles would be endless, except they gave their common
consent, all to be ordered by some, whom they should agree upon, without
which [[consent]] there would be no [[reason]] that one [[man]] should take upon him
to be [[lord]] or [[judge]] over another, hooker's eccl. pol. l. i. sect. 10.)

sect. 92. for he that thinks [[think]] absolute [[power]] purifies men's [[blood]], and
corrects the baseness of [[human]] [[nature]], need [[read]] but the [[history]] of
this, or any other [[age]], to be convinced of the contrary. he that would
have been insolent and injurious in the woods of [[america]], would not
probably be much [[better]] in a [[throne]]; where perhaps learning and religion
shall be found out to justify all that he shall do to his subjects [[subject]], and
the [[sword]] presently [[silence]] all those that dare [[question]] it: for what
the protection of absolute [[monarchy]] is, what [[kind]] of fathers [[father]] of their
countries it makes princes [[prince]] to be and to what a [[degree]] of [[happiness]] and
security it carries civil [[society]], where this sort of [[government]] is
grown to [[perfection]], he that will look into the late relation of ceylon,
may easily see.

sect. 93. in absolute monarchies [[monarchy]] indeed, as well as other governments [[government]] of
the [[world]], the subjects [[subject]] have an appeal to the [[law]], and judges [[judge]] to decide
any controversies, and restrain any [[violence]] that may happen betwixt the
subjects themselves, one amongst another. this every one thinks
necessary, and believes [[belief]] he deserves to be [[thought]] a declared [[enemy]] to
society and [[mankind]], who should go about to take it away. but whether
this be from a true [[love]] of [[mankind]] and [[society]], and such a charity as
we owe all one to another, there is [[reason]] to [[doubt]]: for this is no more
than what every [[man]], who loves [[love]] his own [[power]], [[profit]], or greatness, may
and naturally must do, keep those animals from hurting, or destroying
one another, who [[labour]] and drudge only for his [[pleasure]] and advantage;
and so are taken [[care]] of, not out of any [[love]] the master has for them,
but [[love]] of himself, and the [[profit]] they bring him: for if it be [[asked]],
what security, what fence is there, in such a [[state]], against the
violence and oppression of this absolute ruler? the very [[question]] can
scarce be borne. they are ready to tell you, that it deserves [[death]] only
to ask after safety. betwixt [[subject]] and [[subject]], they will grant, there
must be measures, laws [[law]] and judges [[judge]], for their mutual [[peace]] and security:
but as for the ruler, he ought to be absolute, and is above all such
circumstances; because he has [[power]] to do more hurt and [[wrong]], it is
right when he does it. to ask how you may be guarded from harm, or
injury, on that side where the strongest hand is to do it, is presently
the voice of faction and rebellion: as if when [[men]] quitting the [[state]] of
nature entered into [[society]], they agreed that all of them but one,
should be under the restraint of laws [[law]], but that he should still retain
all the [[liberty]] of the [[state]] of [[nature]], increased with [[power]], and made
licentious by impunity. this is to [[think]], that [[men]] are so foolish, that
they take [[care]] to avoid what mischiefs may be done them by pole-cats, or
foxes; but are content, nay, [[think]] it safety, to be devoured by lions.

sect. 94. but whatever flatterers may talk to amuse people's
understandings, it hinders not [[men]] from feeling; and when they perceive,
that any [[man]], in what station soever, is out of the bounds of the civil
society which they are of, and that they have no appeal on [[earth]] against
any harm, they may receive from him, they are apt to [[think]] themselves in
the [[state]] of [[nature]], in [[respect]] of him whom they find to be so; and to
take [[care]], as soon as they can, to have that safety and security in
civil [[society]], for which it was first instituted, and for which only
they entered into it. and therefore, though perhaps at first, (as shall
be shewed more at large hereafter in the following part of this
discourse) some one [[good]] and excellent [[man]] having got a pre-eminency
amongst the rest, had this deference paid to his goodness and [[virtue]], as
to a [[kind]] of [[natural]] [[authority]], that the [[chief]] [[rule]], with arbitration of
their differences, by a tacit [[consent]] devolved into his hands, without
any other caution, but the assurance they had of his uprightness and
wisdom; yet when [[time]], giving [[authority]], and (as some [[men]] would persuade
us) sacredness of customs, which the negligent, and unforeseeing
innocence of the first ages [[age]] began, had brought in successors of another
stamp, the [[people]] finding their properties [[property]] not secure under the
government, as then it was, (whereas [[government]] has no other end but the
preservation of* property) could never be safe nor at rest, nor think
themselves in civil [[society]], till the legislature was placed in
collective bodies [[body]] of [[men]], call them senate, [[parliament]], or what you
please. by which means every [[single]] [[person]] became [[subject]], equally with
other the meanest [[men]], to those laws [[law]], which he himself, as part of the
legislative, had established; nor could any one, by his own [[authority]];
avoid the [[force]] of the [[law]], when once made; nor by any pretence of
superiority plead exemption, thereby to license his own, or the
miscarriages of any of his dependents.** no [[man]] in civil [[society]] can be
exempted from the laws [[law]] of it: for if any [[man]] may do what he thinks [[think]] fit,
and there be no appeal on [[earth]], for redress or security against any
harm he shall do; i ask, whether he be not perfectly still in the state
of [[nature]], and so can be no part or member of that civil [[society]]; unless
any one will say, the [[state]] of [[nature]] and civil [[society]] are one and the
same thing, which i have never yet found any one so [[great]] a patron of
anarchy as to affirm.

(*at the first, when some [[certain]] [[kind]] of regiment was once appointed,
it may be that nothing was then farther [[thought]] upon for the manner of
goveming, but all permitted unto their [[wisdom]] and discretion, which were
to [[rule]], till by [[experience]] they found this for all parts very
inconvenient, so as the thing which they had devised for a remedy, did
indeed but increase the sore, which it should have cured. they saw, that
to [[live]] by one man's [[man]] will, became the cause of all men's misery. this
constrained them to come unto laws [[law]], wherein all [[men]] might see their duty
beforehand, and [[know]] the penalties of transgressing them. hooker's eccl.
pol. l. i. sect. 10.)

(**civil [[law]] being the act of the whole [[body]] [[politic]], doth therefore
over-rule each several part of the same [[body]]. hooker, ibid.)




chapter. viii.

of the beginning of [[political]] societies [[society]].


sect. 95. [[men]] being, as has been said, by [[nature]], all [[free]], [[equal]], and
independent, no one can be put out of this estate, and subjected to the
political [[power]] of another, without his own [[consent]]. the only way
whereby any one divests himself of his [[natural]] [[liberty]], and puts on the
bonds of civil [[society]], is by agreeing with other [[men]] to join and unite
into a [[community]] for their comfortable, safe, and peaceable living one
amongst another, in a secure enjoyment of their properties [[property]], and a
greater security against any, that are not of it. this any number of men
may do, because it injures not the [[freedom]] of the rest; they are left as
they were in the [[liberty]] of the [[state]] of [[nature]]. when any number of men
have so consented to make one [[community]] or [[government]], they are thereby
presently incorporated, and make one [[body]] [[politic]], wherein the majority
have a [[right]] to act and conclude the rest.

sect. 96. for when any number of [[men]] have, by the [[consent]] of every
individual, made a [[community]], they have thereby made that [[community]] one
body, with a [[power]] to act as one [[body]], which is only by the will and
determination of the majority: for that which acts any [[community]], being
only the [[consent]] of the individuals [[individual]] of it, and it being necessary to
that which is one [[body]] to move one way; it is necessary the [[body]] should
move that way whither the greater [[force]] carries it, which is the consent
of the majority: or else it is impossible it should act or continue one
body, one [[community]], which the [[consent]] of every [[individual]] that united
into it, agreed that it should; and so every one is bound by that
consent to be concluded by the majority. and therefore we see, that in
assemblies, impowered to act by positive laws [[law]], where no number is set by
that positive [[law]] which impowers them, the act of the majority passes
for the act of the whole, and of course determines, as having, by the
law of [[nature]] and [[reason]], the [[power]] of the whole.

sect. 97. and thus every [[man]], by consenting with others to make one body
politic under one [[government]], puts himself under an obligation, to every
one of that [[society]], to submit to the determination of the majority, and
to be concluded by it; or else this original compact, whereby he with
others incorporates into one [[society]], would signify nothing, and be no
compact, if he be left [[free]], and under no other ties than he was in
before in the [[state]] of [[nature]]. for what appearance would there be of any
compact? what new engagement if he were no farther tied by any decrees
of the [[society]], than he himself [[thought]] fit, and did actually consent
to? this would be still as [[great]] a [[liberty]], as he himself had before his
compact, or any one else in the [[state]] of [[nature]] hath, who may submit
himself, and [[consent]] to any acts of it if he thinks [[think]] fit.

sect. 98. for if the [[consent]] of the majority shall not, in [[reason]], be
received as the act of the whole, and conclude every [[individual]]; nothing
but the [[consent]] of every [[individual]] can make any thing to be the act of
the whole: but such a [[consent]] is next to impossible ever to be had, if
we consider the infirmities of health, and avocations of [[business]], which
in a number, though much less than that of a commonwealth, will
necessarily keep many away from the [[public]] assembly. to which if we add
the variety of opinions [[opinion]], and contrariety of interests, which unavoidably
happen in all collections of [[men]], the coming into [[society]] upon such
terms would be only like cato's coming into the theatre, only to go out
again. such a [[constitution]] as this would make the mighty leviathan of a
shorter duration, than the feeblest creatures, and not let it outlast
the day it was born in: which cannot be supposed, till we can [[think]],
that [[rational]] creatures should [[desire]] and constitute societies [[society]] only to
be dissolved: for where the majority cannot conclude the rest, there
they cannot act as one [[body]], and consequently will be immediately
dissolved again.

sect. 99. whosoever therefore out of a [[state]] of [[nature]] unite into a
community, must be understood to give up all the [[power]], necessary to the
ends for which they unite into [[society]], to the majority of the
community, unless they expresly agreed in any number greater than the
majority. and this is done by barely agreeing to unite into one
political [[society]], which is all the compact that is, or needs be,
between the individuals [[individual]], that enter into, or make up a commonwealth. and
thus that, which begins and actually constitutes any [[political]] [[society]],
is nothing but the [[consent]] of any number of freemen capable of a
majority to unite and incorporate into such a [[society]]. and this is that,
and that only, which did, or could give beginning to any lawful
government in the [[world]].

sect. 100. to this i find two objections made. first, that there are no
instances to be found in story, of a company of [[men]] independent, and
equal one amongst another, that met together, and in this way began and
set up a [[government]].

secondly, it is impossible of [[right]], that [[men]] should do so, because all
men being born under [[government]], they are to submit to that, and are not
at [[liberty]] to begin a new one.

sect. 101. to the first there is this to [[answer]], that it is not at all
to be wondered, that [[history]] gives us but a very little account of [[men]],
that lived together in the [[state]] of [[nature]]. the inconveniences of that
condition, and the [[love]] and want of [[society]], no sooner brought any
number of them together, but they presently [[united]] and incorporated, if
they designed to continue together. and if we may not suppose [[men]] ever
to have been in the [[state]] of [[nature]], because we hear not much of them in
such a [[state]], we may as well suppose the armies [[army]] of salmanasser or xerxes
were never [[children]], because we hear little of them, till they were [[men]],
and imbodied in armies [[army]]. [[government]] is every where antecedent to records,
and letters seldom come in amongst a [[people]] till a long continuation of
civil [[society]] has, by other more necessary [[arts]], provided for their
safety, ease, and plenty: and then they begin to look after the history
of their founders, and search into their original, when they have
outlived the memory of it: for it is with commonwealths as with
particular persons [[person]], they are commonly ignorant of their own births and
infancies: and if they [[know]] any thing of their original, they are
beholden for it, to the accidental records that others have kept of it.
and those that we have, of the beginning of any polities in the [[world]],
excepting that of the [[jews]], where [[god]] himself immediately interposed,
and which favours not at all paternal dominion, are all either plain
instances of such a beginning as i have mentioned, or at least have
manifest footsteps of it.

sect. 102. he must shew a [[strange]] inclination to deny evident matter of
fact, when it agrees not with his hypothesis, who will not allow, that
the beginning of [[rome]] and venice were by the uniting together of several
men [[free]] and independent one of another, amongst whom there was no
natural superiority or subjection. and if josephus acosta's word may be
taken, he tells us, that in many parts of [[america]] there was no
government at all.

there are [[great]] and apparent conjectures, says he, that these [[men]],
speaking of those of peru, for a long [[time]] had neither kings [[king]] nor
commonwealths, but lived in [[troops]], as they do this day in florida, the
cheriquanas, those of brazil, and many other nations, which have no
certain kings [[king]], but as [[occasion]] is offered, in [[peace]] or [[war]], they choose
their captains as they please, 1. i. c. 25.

if it be said, that every [[man]] there was born [[subject]] to his [[father]], or
the head of his [[family]]; that the subjection due from a child to a father
took not away his [[freedom]] of uniting into what [[political]] [[society]] he
thought fit, has been already proved. but be that as it will, these [[men]],
it is evident, were actually [[free]]; and whatever superiority some
politicians now would place in any of them, they themselves claimed it
not, but by [[consent]] were all [[equal]], till by the same [[consent]] they set
rulers over themselves. so that their [[politic]] societies [[society]] all began from a
voluntary union, and the mutual agreement of [[men]] freely acting in the
choice of their governors, and forms of [[government]].

sect. 103. and i [[hope]] those who went away from sparta with palantus,
mentioned by justin, 1. iii. c. 4. will be allowed to have been freemen
independent one of another, and to have set up a [[government]] over
themselves, by their own [[consent]]. thus i have given several examples [[example]],
out of [[history]], of [[people]] [[free]] and in the [[state]] of [[nature]], that being
met together incorporated and began a commonwealth. and if the want of
such instances be an argument to prove that [[government]] were not, nor
could not be so begun, i suppose the contenders for paternal [[empire]] were
better let it alone, than urge it against [[natural]] [[liberty]]: for if they
can give so many instances, out of [[history]], of governments [[government]] begun upon
paternal [[right]], i [[think]] (though at [[best]] an argument from what has been,
to what should of [[right]] be, has no [[great]] force) one might, without any
great danger, yield them the cause. but if i might advise them in the
case, they would do well not to search too much into the original of
governments, as they have begun de facto, lest they should find, at the
foundation of most of them, something very little favourable to the
design they promote, and such a [[power]] as they contend for.

sect. 104. but to conclude, [[reason]] being plain on our side, that [[men]] are
naturally [[free]], and the examples [[example]] of [[history]] shewing, that the
governments of the [[world]], that were begun in [[peace]], had their beginning
laid on that foundation, and were made by the [[consent]] of the [[people]];
there can be little room for [[doubt]], either where the [[right]] is, or what
has been the [[opinion]], or practice of [[mankind]], about the first erecting
of governments [[government]].

sect. 105. i will not deny, that if we look back as far as [[history]] will
direct us, towards the original of commonwealths, we shall generally
find them under the [[government]] and administration of one [[man]]. and i am
also apt to [[believe]], that where a [[family]] was numerous enough to subsist
by itself, and continued entire together, without mixing with others, as
it often happens, where there is much [[land]], and few [[people]], the
government commonly began in the [[father]]: for the [[father]] having, by the
law of [[nature]], the same [[power]] with every [[man]] else to punish, as he
thought fit, any offences against that [[law]], might thereby punish his
transgressing [[children]], even when they were [[men]], and out of their
pupilage; and they were very likely to submit to his [[punishment]], and all
join with him against the offender, in their turns, giving him thereby
power to execute his sentence against any transgression, and so in
effect make him the law-maker, and governor over all that remained in
conjunction with his [[family]]. he was fittest to be trusted; paternal
affection secured their [[property]] and interest under his [[care]]; and the
custom of obeying him, in their [[childhood]], made it easier to submit to
him, rather than to any other. if therefore they must have one to rule
them, as [[government]] is hardly to be avoided amongst [[men]] that live
together; who so likely to be the [[man]] as he that was their common
father; unless negligence, [[cruelty]], or any other defect of [[mind]] or body
made him unfit for it? but when either the [[father]] died, and left his
next heir, for want of [[age]], [[wisdom]], [[courage]], or any other qualities,
less fit for [[rule]]; or where several families [[family]] met, and consented to
continue together; there, it is not to be doubted, but they used their
natural [[freedom]], to set up him, whom they judged the ablest, and most
likely, to [[rule]] well over them. conformable hereunto we find the people
of [[america]], who (living out of the reach of the conquering swords [[sword]], and
spreading domination of the two [[great]] empires of peru and mexico)
enjoyed their own [[natural]] [[freedom]], though, caeteris paribus, they
commonly prefer the heir of their deceased [[king]]; yet if they find him
any way [[weak]], or uncapable, they pass him by, and set up the stoutest
and bravest [[man]] for their ruler.

sect. 106. thus, though looking back as far as records give us any
account of peopling the [[world]], and the [[history]] of nations, we commonly
find the [[government]] to be in one hand; yet it destroys not that which i
affirm, viz. that the beginning of [[politic]] [[society]] depends upon the
consent of the individuals [[individual]], to join into, and make one [[society]]; who,
when they are thus incorporated, might set up what form of government
they [[thought]] fit. but this having given [[occasion]] to [[men]] to mistake, and
think, that by [[nature]] [[government]] was monarchical, and belonged to the
father, it may not be amiss here to consider, why [[people]] in the
beginning generally pitched upon this form, which though perhaps the
father's pre-eminency might, in the first institution of some
commonwealths, give a rise to, and place in the beginning, the [[power]] in
one hand; yet it is plain that the [[reason]], that continued the form of
government in a [[single]] [[person]], was not any regard, or [[respect]] to
paternal [[authority]]; since all petty monarchies [[monarchy]], that is, almost all
monarchies, near their original, have been commonly, at least upon
occasion, elective.

sect. 107. first then, in the beginning of things, the father's
government of the [[childhood]] of those sprung from him, having accustomed
them to the [[rule]] of one [[man]], and taught them that where it was exercised
with [[care]] and [[skill]], with affection and [[love]] to those under it, it was
sufficient to procure and preserve to [[men]] all the [[political]] happiness
they sought for in [[society]]. it was no wonder that they should pitch
upon, and naturally run into that form of [[government]], which from their
infancy they had been all accustomed to; and which, by [[experience]], they
had found both easy and safe. to which, if we add, that [[monarchy]] being
simple, and most obvious to [[men]], whom neither [[experience]] had instructed
in forms of [[government]], nor the [[ambition]] or insolence of [[empire]] had
taught to beware of the encroachments of prerogative, or the
inconveniences of absolute [[power]], which [[monarchy]] in succession was apt
to lay claim to, and bring upon them, it was not at all [[strange]], that
they should not much trouble themselves to [[think]] of methods of
restraining any exorbitances of those to whom they had given the
authority over them, and of balancing the [[power]] of [[government]], by
placing several parts of it in different hands. they had neither felt
the oppression of [[tyrannical]] dominion, nor did the [[fashion]] of the [[age]],
nor their possessions, or way of living, (which afforded little matter
for covetousness or ambition) give them any [[reason]] to apprehend or
provide against it; and therefore it is no wonder they put themselves
into such a frame of [[government]], as was not only, as i said, most
obvious and simple, but also [[best]] suited to their [[present]] [[state]] and
condition; which stood more in need of defence against [[foreign]] invasions
and injuries, than of multiplicity of laws [[law]]. the equality of a simple
poor way of living, confining their desires [[desire]] within the narrow bounds of
each man's [[man]] small [[property]], made few controversies, and so no need of
many laws [[law]] to decide them, or variety of officers to superintend the
process, or look after the execution of [[justice]], where there were but
few trespasses, and few offenders. since then those, who like one
another so well as to join into [[society]], cannot but be supposed to have
some acquaintance and [[friendship]] together, and some trust one in
another; they could not but have greater apprehensions of others, than
of one another: and therefore their first [[care]] and [[thought]] cannot but be
supposed to be, how to secure themselves against [[foreign]] [[force]]. it was
natural for them to put themselves under a frame of [[government]] which
might [[best]] serve to that end, and chuse the wisest and bravest [[man]] to
conduct them in their wars [[war]], and lead them out against their enemies [[enemy]], and
in this chiefly be their ruler.

sect. 108. thus we see, that the kings [[king]] of the indians [[indian]] in [[america]], which
is still a pattern of the first ages [[age]] in [[asia]] and [[europe]], whilst the
inhabitants were too few for the [[country]], and want of [[people]] and money
gave [[men]] no temptation to enlarge their possessions of [[land]], or contest
for wider extent of ground, are little more than generals of their
armies; and though they command absolutely in [[war]], yet at [[home]] and in
time of [[peace]] they exercise very little dominion, and have but a very
moderate sovereignty, the resolutions of [[peace]] and [[war]] being ordinarily
either in the [[people]], or in a council. tho' the [[war]] itself, which admits
not of plurality of governors, naturally devolves the command into the
king's sole [[authority]].

sect. 109. and thus in [[israel]] itself, the [[chief]] [[business]] of their
judges, and first kings [[king]], seems to have been to be captains in [[war]], and
leaders of their armies [[army]]; which (besides what is signified by going out
and in before the [[people]], which was, to march forth to [[war]], and home
again in the heads of their forces) appears plainly in the story of
jephtha. the ammonites making [[war]] upon [[israel]], the gileadites in fear
send to jephtha, a bastard of their [[family]] whom they had cast off, and
article with him, if he will assist them against the ammonites, to make
him their ruler; which they do in these words, and the [[people]] made him
head and captain over them, judg. xi, 11. which was, as it seems, all
one as to be [[judge]]. and he judged [[israel]], judg. xii. 7. that is, was
their captain-general six years. so when jotham upbraids the shechemites
with the obligation they had to gideon, who had been their [[judge]] and
ruler, he tells them, he fought for you, and adventured his [[life]] far,
and delivered you out of the hands of midian, judg. ix. 17. nothing
mentioned of him but what he did as a general: and indeed that is all is
found in his [[history]], or in any of the rest of the judges [[judge]]. and abimelech
particularly is called [[king]], though at most he was but their general.
and when, being weary of the ill conduct of samuel's sons [[son]], the children
of [[israel]] [[desired]] a [[king]], like all the nations to [[judge]] them, and to go
out before them, and to [[fight]] their battles [[battle]], i. sam viii. 20. god
granting their [[desire]], says to samuel, i will send thee a [[man]], and thou
shalt anoint him to be captain over my [[people]] [[israel]], that he may save
my [[people]] out of the hands of the philistines, ix. 16. as if the only
business of a [[king]] had been to lead out their armies [[army]], and [[fight]] in their
defence; and accordingly at his inauguration pouring a vial of [[oil]] upon
him, declares to saul, that the [[lord]] had anointed him to be captain over
his [[inheritance]], x. 1. and therefore those, who after saul's being
solemnly chosen and saluted [[king]] by the tribes at mispah, were unwilling
to have him their [[king]], made no other objection but this, how shall this
man save us? v. 27. as if they should have said, this [[man]] is unfit to be
our [[king]], not having [[skill]] and conduct enough in [[war]], to be able to
defend us. and when [[god]] resolved to transfer the [[government]] to [[david]], it
is in these words, but now thy [[kingdom]] shall not continue: the [[lord]] hath
sought him a [[man]] after his own [[heart]], and the [[lord]] hath commanded him to
be captain over his [[people]], xiii. 14. as if the whole kingly authority
were nothing else but to be their general: and therefore the tribes who
had stuck to saul's [[family]], and opposed david's reign, when they came to
hebron with terms of submission to him, they tell him, amongst other
arguments they had to submit to him as to their [[king]], that he was in
effect their [[king]] in saul's [[time]], and therefore they had no [[reason]] but
to receive him as their [[king]] now. also (say they) in [[time]] [[past]], when
saul was [[king]] over us, thou wast he that reddest out and broughtest in
israel, and the [[lord]] said unto thee, thou shalt feed my [[people]] [[israel]],
and thou shalt be a captain over [[israel]].

sect. 110. thus, whether a [[family]] by degrees [[degree]] grew up into a
commonwealth, and the fatherly [[authority]] being continued on to the
elder [[son]], every one in his turn growing up under it, tacitly submitted
to it, and the easiness and equality of it not offending any one, every
one acquiesced, till [[time]] seemed to have confirmed it, and settled a
right of succession by prescription: or whether several families [[family]], or the
descendants of several families [[family]], whom [[chance]], neighbourhood, or business
brought together, uniting into [[society]], the need of a general, whose
conduct might defend them against their enemies [[enemy]] in [[war]], and the great
confidence the innocence and sincerity of that [[poor]] but [[virtuous]] [[age]],
(such as are almost all those which begin governments [[government]], that ever come to
last in the world) gave [[men]] one of another, made the first beginners of
commonwealths generally put the [[rule]] into one man's [[man]] hand, without any
other express limitation or restraint, but what the [[nature]] of the thing,
and the end of [[government]] required: which ever of those it was that at
first put the [[rule]] into the hands of a [[single]] [[person]], [[certain]] it is no
body was intrusted with it but for the [[public]] [[good]] and safety, and to
those ends, in the infancies of commonwealths, those who had it commonly
used it. and unless they had done so, [[young]] societies [[society]] could not have
subsisted; without such nursing fathers [[father]] tender and careful of the public
weal, all governments [[government]] would have sunk under the weakness and infirmities
of their infancy, and the [[prince]] and the [[people]] had soon perished
together.

sect. 111. but though the golden [[age]] (before [[vain]] [[ambition]], and amor
sceleratus habendi, [[evil]] concupiscence, had corrupted men's minds [[mind]] into a
mistake of true [[power]] and honour) had more [[virtue]], and consequently
better governors, as well as less vicious subjects [[subject]], and there was then
no stretching prerogative on the one side, to [[oppress]] the [[people]]; nor
consequently on the other, any dispute about [[privilege]], to lessen or
restrain the [[power]] of the magistrate, and so no contest betwixt rulers
and [[people]] about governors or [[government]]: yet, when [[ambition]] and luxury
in future ages* would retain and increase the [[power]], without doing the
business for which it was given; and aided by [[flattery]], taught princes
to have distinct and separate interests from their [[people]], [[men]] found it
necessary to examine more carefully the original and rights [[right]] of
government; and to find out ways to restrain the exorbitances, and
prevent the abuses [[abuse]] of that [[power]], which they having intrusted in
another's hands only for their own [[good]], they found was made use of to
hurt them.

(*at first, when some [[certain]] [[kind]] of regiment was once approved, it may
be nothing was then farther [[thought]] upon for the manner of governing,
but all permitted unto their [[wisdom]] and discretion which were to [[rule]],
till by [[experience]] they found this for all parts very inconvenient, so
as the thing which they had devised for a remedy, did indeed but
increase the sore which it should have cured. they saw, that to [[live]] by
one man's [[man]] will, became the cause of all men's misery. this constrained
them to come unto laws [[law]] wherein all [[men]] might see their [[duty]] before hand,
and [[know]] the penalties of transgressing them. hooker's eccl. pol. l. i.
sect. 10.)

sect. 112. thus we may see how probable it is, that [[people]] that were
naturally [[free]], and by their own [[consent]] either submitted to the
government of their [[father]], or [[united]] together out of different families
to make a [[government]], should generally put the [[rule]] into one man's
hands, and chuse to be under the conduct of a [[single]] [[person]], without so
much as by express conditions limiting or regulating his [[power]], which
they [[thought]] safe enough in his honesty and prudence; though they never
dreamed of [[monarchy]] being lure divino, which we never heard of among
mankind, till it was revealed to us by the divinity of this [[last]] [[age]];
nor ever allowed paternal [[power]] to have a [[right]] to dominion, or to be
the foundation of all [[government]]. and thus much may suffice to shew,
that as far as we have any [[light]] from [[history]], we have [[reason]] to
conclude, that all peaceful beginnings of [[government]] have been laid in
the [[consent]] of the [[people]]. i say peaceful, because i shall have occasion
in another place to speak of [[conquest]], which some esteem a way of
beginning of governments [[government]].

the other objection i find urged against the beginning of polities, in
the way i have mentioned, is this, viz.

sect. 113. that all [[men]] being born under [[government]], some or other, it
is impossible any of them should ever be [[free]], and at [[liberty]] to unite
together, and begin a new one, or ever be able to erect a lawful
government.

if this argument be [[good]]; i ask, how came so many lawful monarchies [[monarchy]] into
the [[world]]? for if any [[body]], upon this supposition, can shew me any one
man in any [[age]] of the [[world]] [[free]] to begin a lawful [[monarchy]], i will be
bound to shew him ten other [[free]] [[men]] at [[liberty]], at the same [[time]] to
unite and begin a new [[government]] under a regal, or any other form; it
being demonstration, that if any one, born under the dominion of
another, may be so [[free]] as to have a [[right]] to command others in a new
and distinct [[empire]], every one that is born under the dominion of
another may be so [[free]] too, and may become a ruler, or [[subject]], of a
distinct separate [[government]]. and so by this their own [[principle]], either
all [[men]], however born, are [[free]], or else there is but one lawful [[prince]],
one lawful [[government]] in the [[world]]. and then they have nothing to do,
but barely to shew us which that is; which when they have done, i doubt
not but all [[mankind]] will easily agree to [[pay]] [[obedience]] to him.

sect. 114. though it be a sufficient [[answer]] to their objection, to shew
that it involves them in the same difficulties that it doth those they
use it against; yet i shall endeavour to discover the weakness of this
argument a little farther. all [[men]], say they, are born under [[government]],
and therefore they cannot be at [[liberty]] to begin a new one. every one is
born a [[subject]] to his [[father]], or his [[prince]], and is therefore under the
perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance. it is plain [[mankind]] never
owned nor considered any such [[natural]] subjection that they were born in,
to one or to the other that tied them, without their own consents, to a
subjection to them and their heirs.

sect. 115. for there are no examples [[example]] so frequent in [[history]], both sacred
and profane, as those of [[men]] withdrawing themselves, and their
obedience, from the jurisdiction they were born under, and the [[family]] or
community they were bred up in, and setting up new governments [[government]] in other
places; from whence sprang all that number of petty commonwealths in the
beginning of ages [[age]], and which always multiplied, as long as there was
room enough, till the stronger, or more fortunate, swallowed the weaker;
and those [[great]] ones again breaking to pieces, dissolved into lesser
dominions. all which are so many testimonies against paternal
sovereignty, and plainly prove, that it was not the [[natural]] [[right]] of the
father descending to his heirs, that made governments [[government]] in the beginning,
since it was impossible, upon that ground, there should have been so
many little kingdoms [[kingdom]]; all must have been but only one universal
monarchy, if [[men]] had not been at [[liberty]] to separate themselves from
their families [[family]], and the [[government]], be it what it will, that was set up
in it, and go and make distinct commonwealths and other governments [[government]], as
they [[thought]] fit.

sect. 116. this has been the practice of the [[world]] from its first
beginning to this day; nor is it now any more hindrance to the freedom
of [[mankind]], that they are born under constituted and ancient polities,
that have established laws [[law]], and set forms of [[government]], than if they
were born in the woods, amongst the unconfined inhabitants, that run
loose in them: for those, who would persuade us, that by being born
under any [[government]], we are naturally subjects [[subject]] to it, and have no more
any title or pretence to the [[freedom]] of the [[state]] of [[nature]], have no
other [[reason]] (bating that of paternal [[power]], which we have already
answered) to [[produce]] for it, but only, because our fathers [[father]] or
progenitors passed away their [[natural]] [[liberty]], and thereby bound up
themselves and their [[posterity]] to a perpetual subjection to the
government, which they themselves submitted to. it is true, that
whatever engagements or promises any one has made for himself, he is
under the obligation of them, but cannot, by any compact whatsoever,
bind his [[children]] or [[posterity]]: for his [[son]], when a [[man]], being
altogether as [[free]] as the [[father]], any act of the [[father]] can no more give
away the [[liberty]] of the [[son]], than it can of any [[body]] else: he may indeed
annex such conditions to the [[land]], he enjoyed as a [[subject]] of any
commonwealth, as may oblige his [[son]] to be of that [[community]], if he will
enjoy those possessions which were his father's; because that estate
being his father's [[property]], he may dispose, or settle it, as he
pleases.

sect. 117. and this has generally given the [[occasion]] to mistake in this
matter; because commonwealths not permitting any part of their dominions
to be dismembered, nor to be enjoyed by any but those of their
community, the [[son]] cannot ordinarily enjoy the possessions of his
father, but under the same terms his [[father]] did, by becoming a member of
the [[society]]; whereby he puts himself presently under the [[government]] he
finds there established, as much as any other [[subject]] of that
commonwealth. and thus the [[consent]] of freemen, born under [[government]],
which only makes them members of it, being given separately in their
turns, as each comes to be of [[age]], and not in a multitude together;
people take no notice of it, and thinking it not done at all, or not
necessary, conclude they are naturally subjects [[subject]] as they are [[men]].

sect. 118. but, it is plain, governments [[government]] themselves [[understand]] it
otherwise; they claim no [[power]] over the [[son]], because of that they had
over the [[father]]; nor look on [[children]] as being their subjects [[subject]], by their
fathers being so. if a [[subject]] of [[england]] have a child, by an english
woman in [[france]], whose [[subject]] is he? not the [[king]] of england's; for he
must have leave to be admitted to the privileges [[privilege]] of it: nor the [[king]] of
france's; for how then has his [[father]] a [[liberty]] to bring him away, and
breed him as he pleases? and who ever was judged as a traytor or
deserter, if he left, or warred against a [[country]], for being barely born
in it of parents that were aliens there? it is plain then, by the
practice of governments [[government]] themselves, as well as by the [[law]] of right
reason, that a child is born a [[subject]] of no [[country]] or [[government]]. he
is under his father's tuition and [[authority]], till he comes to [[age]] of
discretion; and then he is a freeman, at [[liberty]] what [[government]] he will
put himself under, what [[body]] [[politic]] he will unite himself to: for if an
englishman's [[son]], born in [[france]], be at [[liberty]], and may do so, it is
evident there is no tie upon him by his father's being a [[subject]] of this
kingdom; nor is he bound up by any compact of his [[ancestors]]. and why
then hath not his [[son]], by the same [[reason]], the same [[liberty]], though he
be born any where else? since the [[power]] that a [[father]] hath naturally
over his [[children]], is the same, where-ever they be born, and the ties of
natural obligations, are not bounded by the positive limits of kingdoms
and commonwealths.

sect. 119. every [[man]] being, as has been shewed, naturally [[free]], and
nothing being able to put him into subjection to any earthly [[power]], but
only his own [[consent]]; it is to be considered, what shall be understood
to be a sufficient declaration of a man's [[man]] [[consent]], to make him subject
to the laws [[law]] of any [[government]]. there is a [[common]] distinction of an
express and a tacit [[consent]], which will concern our [[present]] case. no
body doubts [[doubt]] but an express [[consent]], of any [[man]] entering into any
society, makes him a [[perfect]] member of that [[society]], a [[subject]] of that
government. the difficulty is, what ought to be looked upon as a tacit
consent, and how far it binds, i.e. how far any one shall be looked on
to have consented, and thereby submitted to any [[government]], where he has
made no expressions of it at all. and to this i say, that every [[man]],
that hath any possessions, or enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of
any [[government]], doth thereby give his tacit [[consent]], and is as far
forth obliged to [[obedience]] to the laws [[law]] of that [[government]], during such
enjoyment, as any one under it; whether this his possession be of [[land]],
to him and his heirs for ever, or a lodging only for a week; or whether
it be barely travelling freely on the highway; and in effect, it reaches
as far as the very being of any one within the territories of that
government.

sect. 120. to [[understand]] this the [[better]], it is fit to consider, that
every [[man]], when he at first incorporates himself into any commonwealth,
he, by his uniting himself thereunto, annexed also, and submits to the
community, those possessions, which he has, or shall acquire, that do
not already belong to any other [[government]]: for it would be a direct
contradiction, for any one to enter into [[society]] with others for the
securing and regulating of [[property]]; and yet to suppose his [[land]], whose
property is to be regulated by the laws [[law]] of the [[society]], should be exempt
from the jurisdiction of that [[government]], to which he himself, the
proprietor of the [[land]], is a [[subject]]. by the same act therefore, whereby
any one unites his [[person]], which was before [[free]], to any commonwealth,
by the same he unites his possessions, which were before [[free]], to it
also; and they become, both of them, [[person]] and possession, [[subject]] to
the [[government]] and dominion of that commonwealth, as long as it hath a
being. whoever therefore, from thenceforth, by [[inheritance]], purchase,
permission, or otherways, enjoys any part of the [[land]], so annexed to,
and under the [[government]] of that commonwealth, must take it with the
condition it is under; that is, of submitting to the [[government]] of the
commonwealth, under whose jurisdiction it is, as far forth as any
subject of it.

sect. 121. but since the [[government]] has a direct jurisdiction only over
the [[land]], and reaches the possessor of it, (before he has actually
incorporated himself in the society) only as he dwells upon, and enjoys
that; the obligation any one is under, by [[virtue]] of such enjoyment, to
submit to the [[government]], begins and ends with the enjoyment; so that
whenever the owner, who has given nothing but such a tacit [[consent]] to
the [[government]], will, by donation, sale, or otherwise, quit the said
possession, he is at [[liberty]] to go and incorporate himself into any
other commonwealth; or to agree with others to begin a new one, in
vacuis locis, in any part of the [[world]], they can find [[free]] and
unpossessed: whereas he, that has once, by actual agreement, and any
express declaration, given his [[consent]] to be of any commonwealth, is
perpetually and indispensably obliged to be, and remain unalterably a
subject to it, and can never be again in the [[liberty]] of the [[state]] of
nature; unless, by any calamity, the [[government]] he was under comes to be
dissolved; or else by some [[public]] act cuts him off from being any longer
a member of it.

sect. 122. but submitting to the laws [[law]] of any [[country]], living quietly,
and enjoying privileges [[privilege]] and protection under them, makes not a [[man]] a
member of that [[society]]: this is only a local protection and homage due
to and from all those, who, not being in a [[state]] of [[war]], come within the
territories belonging to any [[government]], to all parts whereof the force
of its laws [[law]] extends. but this no more makes a [[man]] a member of that
society, a perpetual [[subject]] of that commonwealth, than it would make a
man a [[subject]] to another, in whose [[family]] he found it convenient to
abide for some [[time]]; though, whilst he continued in it, he were obliged
to comply with the laws [[law]], and submit to the [[government]] he found there.
and thus we see, that foreigners, by living all their lives [[life]] under
another [[government]], and enjoying the privileges [[privilege]] and protection of it,
though they are bound, even in [[conscience]], to submit to its
administration, as far forth as any denison; yet do not thereby come to
be subjects [[subject]] or members of that commonwealth. nothing can make any man
so, but his actually entering into it by positive engagement, and
express promise and compact. this is that, which i [[think]], concerning the
beginning of [[political]] societies [[society]], and that [[consent]] which makes any one a
member of any commonwealth.




chapter. ix.

of the ends of [[political]] [[society]] and [[government]].


sect. 123. if [[man]] in the [[state]] of [[nature]] be so [[free]], as has been said;
if he be absolute [[lord]] of his own [[person]] and possessions, [[equal]] to the
greatest, and [[subject]] to no [[body]], why will he part with his [[freedom]]? why
will he give up this [[empire]], and [[subject]] himself to the dominion and
controul of any other [[power]]? to which it is obvious to [[answer]], that
though in the [[state]] of [[nature]] he hath such a [[right]], yet the enjoyment of
it is very uncertain, and constantly exposed to the [[invasion]] of others:
for all being kings [[king]] as much as he, every [[man]] his [[equal]], and the greater
part no strict observers of equity and [[justice]], the enjoyment of the
property he has in this [[state]] is very unsafe, very unsecure. this makes
him willing to quit a condition, which, however [[free]], is full of fears
and continual dangers: and it is not without [[reason]], that he seeks out,
and is willing to join in [[society]] with others, who are already [[united]],
or have a [[mind]] to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives [[life]],
liberties and estates, which i call by the general name, [[property]].

sect. 124. the [[great]] and [[chief]] end, therefore, of men's uniting into
commonwealths, and putting themselves under [[government]], is the
preservation of their [[property]]. to which in the [[state]] of [[nature]] there
are many things wanting.

first, there wants an established, settled, known [[law]], received and
allowed by [[common]] [[consent]] to be the standard of [[right]] and [[wrong]], and the
common measure to decide all controversies between them: for though the
law of [[nature]] be plain and intelligible to all [[rational]] creatures; yet
men being biassed by their interest, as well as ignorant for want of
study of it, are not apt to allow of it as a [[law]] binding to them in the
application of it to their particular cases.

sect. 125. secondly, in the [[state]] of [[nature]] there wants a known and
indifferent [[judge]], with [[authority]] to determine all differences according
to the established [[law]]: for every one in that [[state]] being both [[judge]] and
executioner of the [[law]] of [[nature]], [[men]] being partial to themselves,
passion and [[revenge]] is very apt to carry them too far, and with too much
heat, in their own cases; as well as negligence, and unconcernedness, to
make them too remiss in other men's.

sect. 126. thirdly, in the [[state]] of [[nature]] there often wants [[power]] to
back and support the sentence when [[right]], and to give it due execution,
they who by any [[injustice]] offended, will seldom fail, where they are
able, by [[force]] to make [[good]] their [[injustice]]; such [[resistance]] many times
makes the [[punishment]] dangerous, and frequently destructive, to those who
attempt it.

sect. 127. thus [[mankind]], notwithstanding all the privileges [[privilege]] of the state
of [[nature]], being but in an ill condition, while they remain in it, are
quickly driven into [[society]]. hence it comes to pass, that we seldom find
any number of [[men]] [[live]] any [[time]] together in this [[state]]. the
inconveniencies that they are therein exposed to, by the irregular and
uncertain exercise of the [[power]] every [[man]] has of punishing the
transgressions of others, make them take sanctuary under the established
laws of [[government]], and therein seek the preservation of their [[property]].
it is this makes them so willingly give up every one his [[single]] [[power]] of
punishing, to be exercised by such alone, as shall be appointed to it
amongst them; and by such rules [[rule]] as the [[community]], or those authorized by
them to that [[purpose]], shall agree on. and in this we have the original
right and rise of both the legislative and executive [[power]], as well as
of the governments [[government]] and societies [[society]] themselves.

sect. 128. for in the [[state]] of [[nature]], to omit the [[liberty]] he has of
innocent delights, a [[man]] has two powers [[power]].

the first is to do whatsoever he thinks [[think]] fit for the preservation of
himself, and others within the permission of the [[law]] of [[nature]]: by which
law, [[common]] to them all, he and all the rest of [[mankind]] are one
community, make up one [[society]], distinct from all other creatures. and
were it not for the [[corruption]] and vitiousness of degenerate [[men]], there
would be no need of any other; no necessity that [[men]] should separate
from this [[great]] and [[natural]] [[community]], and by positive agreements
combine into smaller and divided associations.

the other [[power]] a [[man]] has in the [[state]] of [[nature]], is the [[power]] to punish
the crimes committed against that [[law]]. both these he gives up, when he
joins in a private, if i may so call it, or particular [[politic]] [[society]],
and incorporates into any commonwealth, separate from the rest of
mankind.

sect. 129. the first [[power]], viz. of doing whatsoever he [[thought]] for the
preservation of himself, and the rest of [[mankind]], he gives up to be
regulated by laws [[law]] made by the [[society]], so far forth as the preservation
of himself, and the rest of that [[society]] shall require; which laws [[law]] of
the [[society]] in many things confine the [[liberty]] he had by the [[law]] of
nature.

sect. 130. secondly, the [[power]] of punishing he wholly gives up, and
engages his [[natural]] [[force]], (which he might before employ in the
execution of the [[law]] of [[nature]], by his own [[single]] [[authority]], as he
thought fit) to assist the executive [[power]] of the [[society]], as the law
thereof shall require: for being now in a new [[state]], wherein he is to
enjoy many conveniencies, from the [[labour]], assistance, and [[society]] of
others in the same [[community]], as well as protection from its whole
strength; he is to part also with as much of his [[natural]] [[liberty]], in
providing for himself, as the [[good]], [[prosperity]], and safety of the
society shall require; which is not only necessary, but just, since the
other members of the [[society]] do the like.

sect. 131. but though [[men]], when they enter into [[society]], give up the
equality, [[liberty]], and executive [[power]] they had in the [[state]] of [[nature]],
into the hands of the [[society]], to be so far disposed of by the
legislative, as the [[good]] of the [[society]] shall require; yet it being only
with an intention in every one the [[better]] to preserve himself, his
liberty and [[property]]; (for no [[rational]] creature can be supposed to
change his condition with an intention to be worse) the [[power]] of the
society, or legislative constituted by them, can never be supposed to
extend farther, than the [[common]] [[good]]; but is obliged to secure every
one's [[property]], by providing against those three defects above
mentioned, that made the [[state]] of [[nature]] so unsafe and uneasy. and so
whoever has the legislative or supreme [[power]] of any commonwealth, is
bound to govern by established standing laws [[law]], promulgated and known to
the [[people]], and not by extemporary decrees; by indifferent and upright
judges, who are to decide controversies by those laws [[law]]; and to employ the
force of the [[community]] at [[home]], only in the execution of such laws [[law]], or
abroad to prevent or redress [[foreign]] injuries, and secure the community
from inroads and [[invasion]]. and all this to be directed to no other end,
but the [[peace]], safety, and [[public]] [[good]] of the [[people]].




chapter. x.

of the forms of a common-wealth.


sect. 132. the majority having, as has been shewed, upon men's first
uniting into [[society]], the whole [[power]] of the [[community]] naturally in
them, may employ all that [[power]] in making laws [[law]] for the [[community]] from
time to [[time]], and executing those laws [[law]] by officers of their own
appointing; and then the form of the [[government]] is a [[perfect]] [[democracy]]:
or else may put the [[power]] of making laws [[law]] into the hands of a few select
men, and their heirs or successors; and then it is an [[oligarchy]]: or else
into the hands of one [[man]], and then it is a [[monarchy]]: if to him and his
heirs, it is an hereditary [[monarchy]]: if to him only for [[life]], but upon
his [[death]] the [[power]] only of nominating a successor to return to them; an
elective [[monarchy]]. and so accordingly of these the [[community]] may make
compounded and mixed forms of [[government]], as they [[think]] [[good]]. and if the
legislative [[power]] be at first given by the majority to one or more
persons only for their lives [[life]], or any limited [[time]], and then the supreme
power to revert to them again; when it is so reverted, the [[community]] may
dispose of it again anew into what hands they please, and so constitute
a new form of [[government]]: for the form of [[government]] depending upon the
placing the supreme [[power]], which is the legislative, it being impossible
to conceive that an inferior [[power]] should prescribe to a superior, or
any but the supreme make laws [[law]], according as the [[power]] of making laws [[law]] is
placed, such is the form of the commonwealth.

sect. 133. by commonwealth, i must be understood all along to mean, not
a [[democracy]], or any form of [[government]], but any independent [[community]],
which the latines signified by the word civitas, to which the word which
best answers [[answer]] in our [[language]], is commonwealth, and most properly
expresses such a [[society]] of [[men]], which [[community]] or [[city]] in english does
not; for there may be subordinate communities [[community]] in a [[government]]; and city
amongst us has a quite different notion from commonwealth: and
therefore, to avoid ambiguity, i crave leave to use the word
commonwealth in that sense, in which i find it used by [[king]] james the
first; and i take it to be its [[genuine]] signification; which if any body
dislike, i [[consent]] with him to [[change]] it for a [[better]].




chapter. xi.

of the extent of the legislative [[power]].


sect. 134. the [[great]] end of men's entering into [[society]], being the
enjoyment of their properties [[property]] in [[peace]] and safety, and the great
instrument and means of that being the laws [[law]] established in that [[society]];
the first and fundamental positive [[law]] of all commonwealths is the
establishing of the legislative [[power]]; as the first and fundamental
natural [[law]], which is to govern even the legislative itself, is the
preservation of the [[society]], and (as far as will consist with the public
good) of every [[person]] in it. this legislative is not only the supreme
power of the commonwealth, but [[sacred]] and unalterable in the hands
where the [[community]] have once placed it; nor can any edict of any body
else, in what form soever conceived, or by what [[power]] soever backed,
have the [[force]] and obligation of a [[law]], which has not its sanction from
that legislative which the [[public]] has chosen and appointed: for without
this the [[law]] could not have that, which is absolutely necessary to its
being a [[law]],* the [[consent]] of the [[society]], over whom no [[body]] can have a
power to make laws [[law]], but by their own [[consent]], and by [[authority]] received
from them; and therefore all the [[obedience]], which by the most solemn
ties any one can be obliged to [[pay]], ultimately terminates in this
supreme [[power]], and is directed by those laws [[law]] which it enacts: nor can
any oaths to any [[foreign]] [[power]] whatsoever, or any domestic subordinate
power, discharge any member of the [[society]] from his [[obedience]] to the
legislative, acting pursuant to their trust; nor oblige him to any
obedience contrary to the laws [[law]] so enacted, or farther than they do
allow; it being ridiculous to imagine one can be tied ultimately to obey
any [[power]] in the [[society]], which is not the supreme.

(*the lawful [[power]] of making laws [[law]] to command whole [[politic]] societies [[society]] of
men, belonging so properly unto the same intire societies [[society]], that for any
prince or potentate of what [[kind]] soever upon [[earth]], to exercise the same
of himself, and not by express commission immediately and personally
received from [[god]], or else by [[authority]] derived at the first from their
consent, upon whose persons [[person]] they impose laws [[law]], it is no [[better]] than mere
tyranny. laws [[law]] they are not therefore which [[public]] approbation hath not
made so. hooker's eccl. pol. l. i. sect. 10.

of this point therefore we are to note, that such [[men]] naturally have no
full and [[perfect]] [[power]] to command whole [[politic]] multitudes of [[men]],
therefore utterly without our [[consent]], we could in such sort be at no
man's commandment living. and to be commanded we do [[consent]], when that
society, whereof we be a part, hath at any [[time]] before consented,
without revoking the same after by the like universal agreement. laws
therefore [[human]], of what [[kind]] so ever, are available by [[consent]]. ibid.)

sect. 135. though the legislative, whether placed in one or more,
whether it be always in being, or only by intervals, though it be the
supreme [[power]] in every commonwealth; yet:

first, it is not, nor can possibly be absolutely arbitrary over the
lives and fortunes [[fortune]] of the [[people]]: for it being but the joint [[power]] of
every member of the [[society]] given up to that [[person]], or assembly, which
is legislator; it can be no more than those persons [[person]] had in a [[state]] of
nature before they entered into [[society]], and gave up to the [[community]]:
for no [[body]] can transfer to another more [[power]] than he has in himself;
and no [[body]] has an absolute arbitrary [[power]] over himself, or over any
other, to [[destroy]] his own [[life]], or take away the [[life]] or [[property]] of
another. a [[man]], as has been proved, cannot [[subject]] himself to the
arbitrary [[power]] of another; and having in the [[state]] of [[nature]] no
arbitrary [[power]] over the [[life]], [[liberty]], or possession of another, but
only so much as the [[law]] of [[nature]] gave him for the preservation of
himself, and the rest of [[mankind]]; this is all he doth, or can give up
to the commonwealth, and by it to the legislative [[power]], so that the
legislative can have no more than this. their [[power]], in the utmost
bounds of it, is limited to the [[public]] [[good]] of the [[society]]. it is a
power, that hath no other end but preservation, and therefore can never
have a [[right]] to [[destroy]], enslave, or designedly to impoverish the
subjects.* the obligations of the [[law]] of [[nature]] cease not in [[society]],
but only in many cases are drawn closer, and have by [[human]] laws [[law]] known
penalties annexed to them, to inforce their observation. thus the [[law]] of
nature stands as an eternal [[rule]] to all [[men]], legislators as well as
others. the rules [[rule]] that they make for other men's actions, must, as well
as their own and other men's actions, be conformable to the [[law]] of
nature, i.e. to the will of [[god]], of which that is a declaration, and the
fundamental [[law]] of [[nature]] being the preservation of [[mankind]], no human
sanction can be [[good]], or valid against it.

(*two foundations there are which bear up [[public]] societies [[society]]; the one a
natural inclination, whereby all [[men]] [[desire]] sociable [[life]] and
fellowship; the other an order, expresly or secretly agreed upon,
touching the manner of their union in living together: the latter is
that which we call the [[law]] of a common-weal, the very [[soul]] of a politic
body, the parts whereof are by [[law]] animated, held together, and set on
work in such actions as the [[common]] [[good]] requireth. laws [[law]] [[politic]],
ordained for external order and regiment amongst [[men]], are never framed
as they should be, unless presuming the will of [[man]] to be inwardly
obstinate, rebellious, and averse from all [[obedience]] to the [[sacred]] laws
of his [[nature]]; in a word, unless presuming [[man]] to be, in regard of his
depraved [[mind]], little [[better]] than a wild beast, they do accordingly
provide, notwithstanding, so to frame his outward actions, that they be
no hindrance unto the [[common]] [[good]], for which societies [[society]] are instituted.
unless they do this, they are not [[perfect]]. hooker's eccl. pol. l. i.
sect. 10.)

sect. 136. secondly, the legislative, or supreme [[authority]], cannot
assume to its [[self]] a [[power]] to [[rule]] by extemporary arbitrary decrees, but
is bound to dispense [[justice]], and decide the rights [[right]] of the [[subject]] by
promulgated standing laws [[law]], and known authorized judges [[judge]]:* for the [[law]] of
nature being unwritten, and so no where to be found but in the minds [[mind]] of
men, they who through passion or interest shall miscite, or misapply it,
cannot so easily be convinced of their mistake where there is no
established [[judge]]: and so it serves not, as it ought, to determine the
rights, and fence the properties [[property]] of those that [[live]] under it, especially
where every one is [[judge]], interpreter, and executioner of it too, and
that in his own case: and he that has [[right]] on his side, having
ordinarily but his own [[single]] [[strength]], hath not [[force]] enough to defend
himself from injuries, or to punish delinquents. to avoid these
inconveniences, which disorder men's propperties in the [[state]] of [[nature]],
men unite into societies [[society]], that they may have the [[united]] [[strength]] of the
whole [[society]] to secure and defend their properties [[property]], and may have
standing rules [[rule]] to bound it, by which every one may [[know]] what is his. to
this end it is that [[men]] give up all their [[natural]] [[power]] to the society
which they enter into, and the [[community]] put the legislative [[power]] into
such hands as they [[think]] fit, with this trust, that they shall be
governed by declared laws [[law]], or else their [[peace]], quiet, and [[property]] will
still be at the same uncertainty, as it was in the [[state]] of [[nature]].

(*human laws [[law]] are measures in [[respect]] of [[men]] whose actions they must
direct, howbeit such measures they are as have also their higher rules
to be measured by, which rules [[rule]] are two, the [[law]] of [[god]], and the [[law]] of
nature; so that laws [[law]] [[human]] must be made according to the general laws [[law]] of
nature, and without contradiction to any positive [[law]] of [[scripture]],
otherwise they are ill made. hooker's eccl. pol. l. iii. sect. 9.

to constrain [[men]] to any thing inconvenient doth seem unreasonable.
ibid. l. i. sect. 10.)

sect. 137. absolute arbitrary [[power]], or governing without settled
standing laws [[law]], can neither of them consist with the ends of [[society]] and
government, which [[men]] would not quit the [[freedom]] of the [[state]] of nature
for, and tie themselves up under, were it not to preserve their lives [[life]],
liberties and fortunes [[fortune]], and by stated rules [[rule]] of [[right]] and [[property]] to
secure their [[peace]] and quiet. it cannot be supposed that they should
intend, had they a [[power]] so to do, to give to any one, or more, an
absolute arbitrary [[power]] over their persons [[person]] and estates, and put a force
into the magistrate's hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily
upon them. this were to put themselves into a worse condition than the
state of [[nature]], wherein they had a [[liberty]] to defend their right
against the injuries of others, and were upon [[equal]] terms of [[force]] to
maintain it, whether invaded by a [[single]] [[man]], or many in combination.
whereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute
arbitrary [[power]] and will of a legislator, they have disarmed themselves,
and armed him, to make a prey of them when he pleases; he being in a
much worse condition, who is exposed to the arbitrary [[power]] of one [[man]],
who has the command of 100,000, than he that is exposed to the arbitrary
power of 100,000 [[single]] [[men]]; no [[body]] being secure, that his will, who
has such a command, is [[better]] than that of other [[men]], though his force
be 100,000 times [[time]] stronger. and therefore, whatever form the
commonwealth is under, the ruling [[power]] ought to govern by declared and
received laws [[law]], and not by extemporary dictates and undetermined
resolutions: for then [[mankind]] will be in a far worse condition than in
the [[state]] of [[nature]], if they shall have armed one, or a few [[men]] with the
joint [[power]] of a multitude, to [[force]] them to obey at [[pleasure]] the
exorbitant and unlimited decrees of their sudden thoughts [[thought]], or
unrestrained, and till that moment unknown wills, without having any
measures set down which may guide and justify their actions: for all the
power the [[government]] has, being only for the [[good]] of the [[society]], as it
ought not to be arbitrary and at [[pleasure]], so it ought to be exercised
by established and promulgated laws [[law]]; that both the [[people]] may [[know]] their
duty, and be safe and secure within the limits of the [[law]]; and the
rulers too kept within their bounds, and not be tempted, by the power
they have in their hands, to employ it to such purposes [[purpose]], and by such
measures, as they would not have known, and own not willingly.

sect. 138. thirdly, the supreme [[power]] cannot take from any [[man]] any part
of his [[property]] without his own [[consent]]: for the preservation of
property being the end of [[government]], and that for which [[men]] enter into
society, it necessarily supposes and requires, that the [[people]] should
have [[property]], without which they must be supposed to lose that, by
entering into [[society]], which was the end for which they entered into it;
too gross an absurdity for any [[man]] to own. [[men]] therefore in society
having [[property]], they have such a [[right]] to the goods [[good]], which by the law
of the [[community]] are their's, that no [[body]] hath a [[right]] to take their
substance or any part of it from them, without their own [[consent]]:
without this they have no [[property]] at all; for i have truly no property
in that, which another can by [[right]] take from me, when he pleases,
against my [[consent]]. hence it is a mistake to [[think]], that the supreme or
legislative [[power]] of any commonwealth, can do what it will, and dispose
of the estates of the [[subject]] arbitrarily, or take any part of them at
pleasure. this is not much to be feared in governments [[government]] where the
legislative consists, wholly or in part, in assemblies which are
variable, whose members, upon the dissolution of the assembly, are
subjects under the [[common]] laws [[law]] of their [[country]], equally with the rest.
but in governments [[government]], where the legislative is in one lasting assembly
always in being, or in one [[man]], as in absolute monarchies [[monarchy]], there is
danger still, that they will [[think]] themselves to have a distinct
interest from the rest of the [[community]]; and so will be apt to increase
their own riches [[rich]] and [[power]], by taking what they [[think]] fit from the
people: for a man's [[man]] [[property]] is not at all secure, tho' there be good
and equitable laws [[law]] to set the bounds of it between him and his fellow
subjects, if he who commands those subjects [[subject]] have [[power]] to take from any
private [[man]], what part he pleases of his [[property]], and use and dispose
of it as he thinks [[think]] [[good]].

sect. 139. but [[government]], into whatsoever hands it is put, being, as i
have before shewed, intrusted with this condition, and for this end,
that [[men]] might have and secure their properties [[property]]; the [[prince]], or senate,
however it may have [[power]] to make laws [[law]], for the regulating of property
between the subjects [[subject]] one amongst another, yet can never have a [[power]] to
take to themselves the whole, or any part of the subjects [[subject]] [[property]],
without their own [[consent]]: for this would be in effect to leave them no
property at all. and to let us see, that even absolute [[power]], where it
is necessary, is not arbitrary by being absolute, but is still limited
by that [[reason]], and confined to those ends, which required it in some
cases to be absolute, we need look no farther than the [[common]] practice
of martial discipline: for the preservation of the [[army]], and in it of
the whole commonwealth, requires an absolute [[obedience]] to the command
of every superior officer, and it is justly [[death]] to disobey or dispute
the most dangerous or unreasonable of them; but yet we see, that neither
the serjeant, that could command a soldier to march up to the mouth of a
cannon, or stand in a breach, where he is almost sure to perish, can
command that soldier to give him one penny of his [[money]]; nor the
general, that can condemn him to [[death]] for deserting his post, or for
not obeying the most desperate orders, can yet, with all his absolute
power of [[life]] and [[death]], dispose of one farthing of that soldier's
estate, or seize one jot of his goods [[good]]; whom yet he can command any
thing, and hang for the least disobedience; because such a blind
obedience is necessary to that end, for which the commander has his
power, viz. the preservation of the rest; but the disposing of his goods
has nothing to do with it.

sect. 140. it is true, governments [[government]] cannot be supported without great
charge, and it is fit every one who enjoys his share of the protection,
should [[pay]] out of his estate his proportion for the maintenance of it.
but still it must be with his own [[consent]], i.e. the [[consent]] of the
majority, giving it either by themselves, or their representatives
chosen by them: for if any one shall claim a [[power]] to lay and levy taxes
on the [[people]], by his own [[authority]], and without such [[consent]] of the
people, he thereby invades the fundamental [[law]] of [[property]], and subverts
the end of [[government]]: for what [[property]] have i in that, which another
may by [[right]] take, when he pleases, to himself?

sect. 141. fourthly, the legislative cannot transfer the [[power]] of making
laws to any other hands: for it being but a delegated [[power]] from the
people, they who have it cannot pass it over to others. the [[people]] alone
can appoint the form of the commonwealth, which is by constituting the
legislative, and appointing in whose hands that shall be. and when the
people have said, we will submit to rules [[rule]], and be governed by laws [[law]] made
by such [[men]], and in such forms, no [[body]] else can say other [[men]] shall
make laws [[law]] for them; nor can the [[people]] be bound by any laws [[law]], but such as
are enacted by those whom they have chosen, and authorized to make laws
for them. the [[power]] of the legislative, being derived from the [[people]] by
a positive voluntary grant and institution, can be no other than what
that positive grant conveyed, which being only to make laws [[law]], and not to
make legislators, the legislative can have no [[power]] to transfer their
authority of making laws [[law]], and place it in other hands.

sect. 142. these are the bounds which the trust, that is put in them by
the [[society]], and the [[law]] of [[god]] and [[nature]], have set to the legislative
power of every commonwealth, in all forms of [[government]].

first, they are to govern by promulgated established laws [[law]], not to be
varied in particular cases, but to have one [[rule]] for [[rich]] and [[poor]], for
the favourite at court, and the [[country]] [[man]] at plough.

secondly, these laws [[law]] also ought to be designed for no other end
ultimately, but the [[good]] of the [[people]].

thirdly, they must not raise taxes on the [[property]] of the [[people]],
without the [[consent]] of the [[people]], given by themselves, or their
deputies. and this properly concerns only such governments [[government]] where the
legislative is always in being, or at least where the [[people]] have not
reserved any part of the legislative to deputies, to be from [[time]] to
time chosen by themselves.

fourthly, the legislative neither must nor can transfer the [[power]] of
making laws [[law]] to any [[body]] else, or place it any where, but where the
people have.




chapter. xii.

of the legislative, executive, and federative [[power]] of the
common-wealth.


sect. 143. the legislative [[power]] is that, which has a [[right]] to direct
how the [[force]] of the commonwealth shall be employed for preserving the
community and the members of it. but because those laws [[law]] which are
constantly to be executed, and whose [[force]] is always to continue, may be
made in a little [[time]]; therefore there is no need, that the legislative
should be always in being, not having always [[business]] to do. and because
it may be too [[great]] a temptation to [[human]] frailty, apt to grasp at
power, for the same persons [[person]], who have the [[power]] of making laws [[law]], to have
also in their hands the [[power]] to execute them, whereby they may exempt
themselves from [[obedience]] to the laws [[law]] they make, and suit the [[law]], both
in its making, and execution, to their own private advantage, and
thereby come to have a distinct interest from the rest of the [[community]],
contrary to the end of [[society]] and [[government]]: therefore in wellordered
commonwealths, where the [[good]] of the whole is so considered, as it
ought, the legislative [[power]] is put into the hands of divers persons [[person]],
who duly assembled, have by themselves, or jointly with others, a power
to make laws [[law]], which when they have done, being separated again, they are
themselves [[subject]] to the laws [[law]] they have made; which is a new and near
tie upon them, to take [[care]], that they make them for the [[public]] [[good]].

sect. 144. but because the laws [[law]], that are at once, and in a short time
made, have a constant and lasting [[force]], and need a perpetual execution,
or an attendance thereunto; therefore it is necessary there should be a
power always in being, which should see to the execution of the laws
that are made, and remain in [[force]]. and thus the legislative and
executive [[power]] come often to be separated.

sect. 145. there is another [[power]] in every commonwealth, which one may
call [[natural]], because it is that which answers [[answer]] to the [[power]] every man
naturally had before he entered into [[society]]: for though in a
commonwealth the members of it are distinct persons [[person]] still in reference
to one another, and as such as governed by the laws [[law]] of the [[society]]; yet
in reference to the rest of [[mankind]], they make one [[body]], which is, as
every member of it before was, still in the [[state]] of [[nature]] with the
rest of [[mankind]]. hence it is, that the controversies that happen between
any [[man]] of the [[society]] with those that are out of it, are managed by the
public; and an injury done to a member of their [[body]], engages the whole
in the reparation of it. so that under this consideration, the whole
community is one [[body]] in the [[state]] of [[nature]], in [[respect]] of all other
states or persons [[person]] out of its [[community]].

sect. 146. this therefore contains the [[power]] of [[war]] and [[peace]], leagues
and alliances, and all the transactions, with all persons [[person]] and
communities without the commonwealth, and may be called federative, if
any one pleases. so the thing be understood, i am indifferent as to the
name.

sect. 147. these two powers [[power]], executive and federative, though they be
really distinct in themselves, yet one comprehending the execution of
the municipal laws [[law]] of the [[society]] within its [[self]], upon all that are
parts of it; the other the management of the security and interest of
the [[public]] without, with all those that it may receive benefit or damage
from, yet they are always almost [[united]]. and though this federative
power in the well or ill management of it be of [[great]] moment to the
commonwealth, yet it is much less capable to be directed by antecedent,
standing, positive laws [[law]], than the executive; and so must necessarily be
left to the prudence and [[wisdom]] of those, whose hands it is in, to be
managed for the [[public]] [[good]]: for the laws [[law]] that concern subjects [[subject]] one
amongst another, being to direct their actions, may well enough precede
them. but what is to be done in reference to foreigners, depending much
upon their actions, and the variation of designs and interests, must be
left in [[great]] part to the prudence of those, who have this power
committed to them, to be managed by the [[best]] of their [[skill]], for the
advantage of the commonwealth.

sect. 148. though, as i said, the executive and federative [[power]] of
every [[community]] be really distinct in themselves, yet they are hardly to
be separated, and placed at the same [[time]], in the hands of distinct
persons: for both of them requiring the [[force]] of the [[society]] for their
exercise, it is almost impracticable to place the [[force]] of the
commonwealth in distinct, and not subordinate hands; or that the
executive and federative [[power]] should be placed in persons [[person]], that might
act separately, whereby the [[force]] of the [[public]] would be under different
commands: which would be apt some [[time]] or other to cause disorder and
ruin.




chapter. xiii.

of the subordination of the powers [[power]] of the common-wealth.


sect. 149. though in a constituted commonwealth, standing upon its own
basis, and acting according to its own [[nature]], that is, acting for the
preservation of the [[community]], there can be but one supreme [[power]], which
is the legislative, to which all the rest are and must be subordinate,
yet the legislative being only a fiduciary [[power]] to act for certain
ends, there remains still in the [[people]] a supreme [[power]] to remove or
alter the legislative, when they find the legislative act contrary to
the trust reposed in them: for all [[power]] given with trust for the
attaining an end, being limited by that end, whenever that end is
manifestly neglected, or opposed, the trust must necessarily be
forfeited, and the [[power]] devolve into the hands of those that gave it,
who may place it anew where they shall [[think]] [[best]] for their safety and
security. and thus the [[community]] perpetually retains a supreme [[power]] of
saving themselves from the attempts and designs of any [[body]], even of
their legislators, whenever they shall be so foolish, or so wicked, as
to lay and carry on designs against the liberties [[liberty]] and properties [[property]] of the
subject: for no [[man]] or [[society]] of [[men]], having a [[power]] to deliver up
their preservation, or consequently the means of it, to the absolute
will and arbitrary dominion of another; when ever any one shall go about
to bring them into such a slavish condition, they will always have a
right to preserve, what they have not a [[power]] to part with; and to rid
themselves of those, who invade this fundamental, [[sacred]], and
unalterable [[law]] of self-preservation, for which they entered into
society. and thus the [[community]] may be said in this [[respect]] to be always
the supreme [[power]], but not as considered under any form of [[government]],
because this [[power]] of the [[people]] can never take place till the
government be dissolved.

sect. 150. in all cases, whilst the [[government]] subsists, the legislative
is the supreme [[power]]: for what can give laws [[law]] to another, must needs be
superior to him; and since the legislative is no otherwise legislative
of the [[society]], but by the [[right]] it has to make laws [[law]] for all the parts,
and for every member of the [[society]], prescribing rules [[rule]] to their actions,
and giving [[power]] of execution, where they are transgressed, the
legislative must needs be the supreme, and all other powers [[power]], in any
members or parts of the [[society]], derived from and subordinate to it.

sect. 151. in some commonwealths, where the legislative is not always in
being, and the executive is vested in a [[single]] [[person]], who has also a
share in the legislative; there that [[single]] [[person]] in a very tolerable
sense may also be called supreme: not that he has in himself all the
supreme [[power]], which is that of law-making; but because he has in him
the supreme execution, from whom all inferior magistrates derive all
their several subordinate powers [[power]], or at least the [[greatest]] part of them:
having also no legislative superior to him, there being no [[law]] to be
made without his [[consent]], which cannot be expected should ever subject
him to the other part of the legislative, he is properly enough in this
sense supreme. but yet it is to be observed, that tho' oaths of
allegiance and fealty are taken to him, it is not to him as supreme
legislator, but as supreme executor of the [[law]], made by a joint [[power]] of
him with others; allegiance being nothing but an [[obedience]] according to
law, which when he violates, he has no [[right]] to [[obedience]], nor can claim
it otherwise than as the [[public]] [[person]] vested with the [[power]] of the [[law]],
and so is to be considered as the image, phantom, or representative of
the commonwealth, acted by the will of the [[society]], declared in its
laws; and thus he has no will, no [[power]], but that of the [[law]]. but when
he quits this representation, this [[public]] will, and acts by his own
private will, he degrades himself, and is but a [[single]] private person
without [[power]], and without will, that has any [[right]] to [[obedience]]; the
members owing no [[obedience]] but to the [[public]] will of the [[society]].

sect. 152. the executive [[power]], placed any where but in a [[person]] that
has also a share in the legislative, is visibly subordinate and
accountable to it, and may be at [[pleasure]] changed and displaced; so that
it is not the supreme executive [[power]], that is exempt from
subordination, but the supreme executive [[power]] vested in one, who having
a share in the legislative, has no distinct superior legislative to be
subordinate and accountable to, farther than he himself shall join and
consent; so that he is no more subordinate than he himself shall think
fit, which one may certainly conclude will be but very little. of other
ministerial and subordinate powers [[power]] in a commonwealth, we need not speak,
they being so multiplied with infinite variety, in the different customs
and constitutions [[constitution]] of distinct commonwealths, that it is impossible to
give a particular account of them all. only thus much, which is
necessary to our [[present]] [[purpose]], we may take notice of concerning them,
that they have no manner of [[authority]], any of them, beyond what is by
positive grant and commission delegated to them, and are all of them
accountable to some other [[power]] in the commonwealth.

sect. 153. it is not necessary, no, nor so much as convenient, that the
legislative should be always in being; but absolutely necessary that the
executive [[power]] should, because there is not always need of new laws [[law]] to
be made, but always need of execution of the laws [[law]] that are made. when
the legislative hath put the execution of the laws [[law]], they make, into
other hands, they have a [[power]] still to resume it out of those hands,
when they find cause, and to punish for any maladministration against
the laws [[law]]. the same holds also in regard of the federative [[power]], that
and the executive being both ministerial and subordinate to the
legislative, which, as has been shewed, in a constituted commonwealth
is the supreme. the legislative also in this case being supposed to
consist of several persons [[person]], (for if it be a [[single]] [[person]], it cannot but
be always in being, and so will, as supreme, naturally have the supreme
executive [[power]], together with the legislative) may assemble, and
exercise their legislature, at the times [[time]] that either their original
constitution, or their own adjournment, appoints, or when they please;
if neither of these hath appointed any [[time]], or there be no other way
prescribed to convoke them: for the supreme [[power]] being placed in them
by the [[people]], it is always in them, and they may exercise it when they
please, unless by their original [[constitution]] they are limited to
certain seasons, or by an act of their supreme [[power]] they have adjourned
to a [[certain]] [[time]]; and when that [[time]] comes, they have a [[right]] to
assemble and act again.

sect. 154. if the legislative, or any part of it, be made up of
representatives chosen for that [[time]] by the [[people]], which afterwards
return into the ordinary [[state]] of subjects [[subject]], and have no share in the
legislature but upon a new [[choice]], this [[power]] of chusing must also be
exercised by the [[people]], either at [[certain]] appointed seasons, or else
when they are summoned to it; and in this latter case the [[power]] of
convoking the legislative is ordinarily placed in the executive, and has
one of these two limitations in [[respect]] of [[time]]: that either the
original [[constitution]] requires their assembling and acting at certain
intervals, and then the executive [[power]] does nothing but ministerially
issue directions for their electing and assembling, according to due
forms; or else it is left to his prudence to call them by new elections,
when the occasions [[occasion]] or exigencies of the [[public]] require the amendment of
old, or making of new laws [[law]], or the redress or prevention of any
inconveniencies, that [[lie]] on, or threaten the [[people]].

sect. 155. it may be demanded here, what if the executive [[power]], being
possessed of the [[force]] of the commonwealth, shall make use of that
force to hinder the meeting and acting of the legislative, when the
original [[constitution]], or the [[public]] exigencies require it? i say, using
force upon the [[people]] without [[authority]], and contrary to the trust put
in him that does so, is a [[state]] of [[war]] with the [[people]], who have a right
to reinstate their legislative in the exercise of their [[power]]: for
having erected a legislative, with an intent they should exercise the
power of making laws [[law]], either at [[certain]] set times [[time]], or when there is need
of it, when they are hindered by any [[force]] from what is so necessary to
the [[society]], and wherein the safety and preservation of the people
consists, the [[people]] have a [[right]] to remove it by [[force]]. in all states
and conditions, the true remedy of [[force]] without [[authority]], is to oppose
force to it. the use of [[force]] without [[authority]], always puts him that
uses it into a [[state]] of [[war]], as the aggressor, and renders him liable to
be treated accordingly.

sect. 156. the [[power]] of assembling and dismissing the legislative,
placed in the executive, gives not the executive a superiority over it,
but is a fiduciary trust placed in him, for the safety of the [[people]], in
a case where the uncertainty and variableness of [[human]] affairs could not
bear a steady fixed [[rule]]: for it not being possible, that the first
framers of the [[government]] should, by any foresight, be so much masters
of future events, as to be able to prefix so just periods of return and
duration to the assemblies of the legislative, in all times [[time]] to come,
that might exactly [[answer]] all the exigencies of the commonwealth; the
best remedy could be found for this defect, was to trust this to the
prudence of one who was always to be [[present]], and whose [[business]] it was
to watch over the [[public]] [[good]]. constant frequent meetings of the
legislative, and long continuations of their assemblies, without
necessary [[occasion]], could not but be burdensome to the [[people]], and must
necessarily in [[time]] [[produce]] more dangerous inconveniencies, and yet the
quick turn of affairs might be sometimes such as to need their present
help: any delay of their convening might endanger the [[public]]; and
sometimes too their [[business]] might be so [[great]], that the limited [[time]] of
their sitting might be too short for their [[work]], and rob the [[public]] of
that benefit which could be had only from their mature deliberation.
what then could be done in this case to prevent the [[community]] from being
exposed some [[time]] or other to eminent hazard, on one side or the other,
by fixed intervals and periods, set to the meeting and acting of the
legislative, but to intrust it to the prudence of some, who being
present, and acquainted with the [[state]] of [[public]] affairs, might make use
of this prerogative for the [[public]] [[good]]? and where else could this be so
well placed as in his hands, who was intrusted with the execution of the
laws for the same end? thus supposing the regulation of times [[time]] for the
assembling and sitting of the legislative, not settled by the original
constitution, it naturally fell into the hands of the executive, not as
an arbitrary [[power]] depending on his [[good]] [[pleasure]], but with this trust
always to have it exercised only for the [[public]] weal, as the occurrences
of times [[time]] and [[change]] of affairs might require. whether settled periods of
their convening, or a [[liberty]] left to the [[prince]] for convoking the
legislative, or perhaps a mixture of both, hath the least inconvenience
attending it, it is not my [[business]] here to inquire, but only to shew,
that though the executive [[power]] may have the prerogative of convoking
and dissolving such conventions of the legislative, yet it is not
thereby superior to it.

sect. 157. things of this [[world]] are in so constant a flux, that nothing
remains long in the same [[state]]. thus [[people]], riches [[rich]], [[trade]], [[power]],
change their stations, flourishing mighty cities [[city]] come to ruin, and prove
in times [[time]] neglected desolate corners, whilst other unfrequented places
grow into populous countries [[country]], filled with [[wealth]] and inhabitants. but
things not always changing equally, and private interest often keeping
up customs and privileges [[privilege]], when the reasons [[reason]] of them are ceased, it often
comes to pass, that in governments [[government]], where part of the legislative
consists of representatives chosen by the [[people]], that in tract of time
this representation becomes very unequal and disproportionate to the
reasons it was at first established upon. to what gross absurdities the
following of custom, when [[reason]] has left it, may lead, we may be
satisfied, when we see the bare name of a town, of which there remains
not so much as the ruins, where scarce so much housing as a sheepcote,
or more inhabitants than a shepherd is to be found, sends as many
representatives to the grand assembly of law-makers, as a whole county
numerous in [[people]], and powerful in riches [[rich]]. this strangers stand amazed
at, and every one must confess needs a remedy; tho' most [[think]] it hard
to find one, because the [[constitution]] of the legislative being the
original and supreme act of the [[society]], antecedent to all positive laws
in it, and depending wholly on the [[people]], no inferior [[power]] can alter
it. and therefore the [[people]], when the legislative is once constituted,
having, in such a [[government]] as we have been speaking of, no [[power]] to
act as long as the [[government]] stands; this inconvenience is thought
incapable of a remedy.

sect. 158. salus populi suprema lex, is certainly so just and
fundamental a [[rule]], that he, who sincerely follows it, cannot
dangerously err. if therefore the executive, who has the [[power]] of
convoking the legislative, observing rather the true proportion, than
fashion of representation, regulates, not by old custom, but true
reason, the number of members, in all places that have a [[right]] to be
distinctly represented, which no part of the [[people]] however incorporated
can pretend to, but in proportion to the assistance which it affords to
the [[public]], it cannot be judged to have set up a new legislative, but to
have restored the old and true one, and to have rectified the disorders
which succession of [[time]] had insensibly, as well as inevitably
introduced: for it being the interest as well as intention of the
people, to have a [[fair]] and [[equal]] representative; whoever brings it
nearest to that, is an undoubted friend to, and establisher of the
government, and cannot miss the [[consent]] and approbation of the
community; prerogative being nothing but a [[power]], in the hands of the
prince, to provide for the [[public]] [[good]], in such cases, which depending
upon unforeseen and uncertain occurrences, [[certain]] and unalterable laws
could not safely direct; whatsoever shall be done manifestly for the
good of the [[people]], and the establishing the [[government]] upon its true
foundations, is, and always will be, just prerogative, the [[power]] of
erecting new corporations, and therewith new representatives, carries
with it a supposition, that in [[time]] the measures of representation might
vary, and those places have a just [[right]] to be represented which before
had none; and by the same [[reason]], those cease to have a [[right]], and be
too inconsiderable for such a [[privilege]], which before had it. 'tis not a
change from the [[present]] [[state]], which perhaps [[corruption]] or decay has
introduced, that makes an inroad upon the [[government]], but the tendency
of it to injure or [[oppress]] the [[people]], and to set up one part or party,
with a distinction from, and an unequal subjection of the rest.
whatsoever cannot but be acknowledged to be of advantage to the [[society]],
and [[people]] in general, upon just and lasting measures, will always, when
done, justify itself; and whenever the [[people]] shall chuse their
representatives upon just and undeniably [[equal]] measures, suitable to the
original frame of the [[government]], it cannot be doubted to be the will
and act of the [[society]], whoever permitted or caused them so to do.




chapter. xiv.

of prerogative.


sect. 159. where the legislative and executive [[power]] are in distinct
hands, (as they are in all moderated monarchies [[monarchy]], and well-framed
governments) there the [[good]] of the [[society]] requires, that several things
should be left to the discretion of him that has the executive [[power]]:
for the legislators not being able to foresee, and provide by laws [[law]], for
all that may be useful to the [[community]], the executor of the laws [[law]] having
the [[power]] in his hands, has by the [[common]] [[law]] of [[nature]] a [[right]] to make
use of it for the [[good]] of the [[society]], in many cases, where the
municipal [[law]] has given no direction, till the legislative can
conveniently be assembled to provide for it. many things there are,
which the [[law]] can by no means provide for; and those must necessarily be
left to the discretion of him that has the executive [[power]] in his hands,
to be ordered by him as the [[public]] [[good]] and advantage shall require:
nay, it is fit that the laws [[law]] themselves should in some cases give way to
the executive [[power]], or rather to this fundamental [[law]] of [[nature]] and
government, viz. that as much as may be, all the members of the society
are to be preserved: for since many accidents may happen, wherein a
strict and rigid observation of the laws [[law]] may do harm; (as not to pull
down an [[innocent]] man's [[man]] house to stop the [[fire]], when the next to it is
burning) and a [[man]] may come sometimes within the reach of the [[law]], which
makes no distinction of persons [[person]], by an action that may deserve reward
and pardon; 'tis fit the ruler should have a [[power]], in many cases, to
mitigate the severity of the [[law]], and pardon some offenders: for the end
of [[government]] being the preservation of all, as much as may be, even the
guilty are to be spared, where it can prove no prejudice to the
innocent.

sect. 160. this [[power]] to act according to discretion, for the public
good, without the prescription of the [[law]], and sometimes even against
it, is that which is called prerogative: for since in some governments
the lawmaking [[power]] is not always in being, and is usually too numerous,
and so too slow, for the dispatch requisite to execution; and because
also it is impossible to foresee, and so by laws [[law]] to provide for, all
accidents and necessities that may concern the [[public]], or to make such
laws as will do no harm, if they are executed with an inflexible rigour,
on all occasions [[occasion]], and upon all persons [[person]] that may come in their way;
therefore there is a latitude left to the executive [[power]], to do many
things of [[choice]] which the laws [[law]] do not prescribe.

sect. 161. this [[power]], whilst employed for the benefit of the [[community]],
and suitably to the trust and ends of the [[government]], is undoubted
prerogative, and never is questioned: for the [[people]] are very seldom or
never scrupulous or nice in the point; they are far from examining
prerogative, whilst it is in any tolerable [[degree]] employed for the use
it was meant, that is, for the [[good]] of the [[people]], and not manifestly
against it: but if there comes to be a [[question]] between the executive
power and the [[people]], about a thing claimed as a prerogative; the
tendency of the exercise of such prerogative to the [[good]] or hurt of the
people, will easily decide that [[question]].

sect. 162. it is easy to conceive, that in the infancy of governments [[government]],
when commonwealths differed little from families [[family]] in number of [[people]],
they differed from them too but little in number of laws [[law]]: and the
governors, being as the fathers [[father]] of them, watching over them for their
good, the [[government]] was almost all prerogative. a few established laws
served the turn, and the discretion and [[care]] of the ruler supplied the
rest. but when mistake or [[flattery]] prevailed with [[weak]] princes [[prince]] to make
use of this [[power]] for private ends of their own, and not for the public
good, the [[people]] were fain by express laws [[law]] to get prerogative determined
in those points wherein they found disadvantage from it: and thus
declared limitations of prerogative were by the [[people]] found necessary
in cases which they and their [[ancestors]] had left, in the utmost
latitude, to the [[wisdom]] of those princes [[prince]] who made no other but a right
use of it, that is, for the [[good]] of their [[people]].

sect. 163. and therefore they have a very [[wrong]] notion of [[government]],
who say, that the [[people]] have encroached upon the prerogative, when they
have got any part of it to be defined by positive laws [[law]]: for in so doing
they have not pulled from the [[prince]] any thing that of [[right]] belonged to
him, but only declared, that that [[power]] which they indefinitely left in
his or his [[ancestors]] hands, to be exercised for their [[good]], was not a
thing which they intended him when he used it otherwise: for the end of
government being the [[good]] of the [[community]], whatsoever alterations are
made in it, tending to that end, cannot be an encroachment upon any
body, since no [[body]] in [[government]] can have a [[right]] tending to any other
end: and those only are encroachments which prejudice or hinder the
public [[good]]. those who say otherwise, speak as if the [[prince]] had a
distinct and separate interest from the [[good]] of the [[community]], and was
not made for it; the root and source from which spring almost all those
evils and disorders which happen in kingly governments [[government]]. and indeed, if
that be so, the [[people]] under his [[government]] are not a [[society]] of
rational creatures, entered into a [[community]] for their mutual [[good]]; they
are not such as have set rulers over themselves, to guard, and promote
that [[good]]; but are to be looked on as an herd of inferior creatures
under the dominion of a master, who keeps them and works [[work]] them for his
own [[pleasure]] or [[profit]]. if [[men]] were so void of [[reason]], and brutish, as
to enter into [[society]] upon such terms, prerogative might indeed be, what
some [[men]] would have it, an arbitrary [[power]] to do things hurtful to the
people.

sect. 164. but since a [[rational]] creature cannot be supposed, when [[free]],
to put himself into subjection to another, for his own harm; (though,
where he finds a [[good]] and [[wise]] ruler, he may not perhaps [[think]] it either
necessary or useful to set precise bounds to his [[power]] in all things)
prerogative can be nothing but the people's permitting their rulers to
do several things, of their own [[free]] [[choice]], where the [[law]] was silent,
and sometimes too against the direct letter of the [[law]], for the public
good; and their acquiescing in it when so done: for as a [[good]] [[prince]],
who is mindful of the trust put into his hands, and careful of the good
of his [[people]], cannot have too much prerogative, that is, [[power]] to do
good; so a [[weak]] and ill [[prince]], who would claim that [[power]] which his
predecessors exercised without the direction of the [[law]], as a
prerogative belonging to him by [[right]] of his office, which he may
exercise at his [[pleasure]], to make or promote an interest distinct from
that of the [[public]], gives the [[people]] an [[occasion]] to claim their [[right]],
and limit that [[power]], which, whilst it was exercised for their [[good]],
they were content should be tacitly allowed.

sect. 165. and therefore he that will look into the [[history]] of [[england]],
will find, that prerogative was always largest in the hands of our
wisest and [[best]] princes [[prince]]; because the [[people]], observing the whole
tendency of their actions to be the [[public]] [[good]], contested not what was
done without [[law]] to that end: or, if any [[human]] frailty or mistake (for
princes are but [[men]], made as others) appeared in some small declinations
from that end; yet 'twas visible, the main of their conduct tended to
nothing but the [[care]] of the [[public]]. the [[people]] therefore, finding reason
to be satisfied with these princes [[prince]], whenever they acted without, or
contrary to the letter of the [[law]], acquiesced in what they did, and,
without the least complaint, let them inlarge their prerogative as they
pleased, judging rightly, that they did nothing herein to the prejudice
of their laws [[law]], since they acted conformable to the foundation and end of
all laws [[law]], the [[public]] [[good]].

sect. 166. such god-like princes [[prince]] indeed had some title to arbitrary
power by that argument, that would prove absolute [[monarchy]] the best
government, as that which [[god]] himself governs the [[universe]] by; because
such kings [[king]] partake of his [[wisdom]] and goodness. upon this is founded that
saying, that the reigns of [[good]] princes [[prince]] have been always most dangerous
to the liberties [[liberty]] of their [[people]]: for when their successors, managing
the [[government]] with different thoughts [[thought]], would draw the actions of those
good rulers into precedent, and make them the standard of their
prerogative, as if what had been done only for the [[good]] of the people
was a [[right]] in them to do, for the harm of the [[people]], if they so
pleased; it has often occasioned contest, and sometimes public
disorders, before the [[people]] could recover their original [[right]], and get
that to be declared not to be prerogative, which truly was never so;
since it is impossible that any [[body]] in the [[society]] should ever have a
right to do the [[people]] harm; though it be very possible, and reasonable,
that the [[people]] should not go about to set any bounds to the prerogative
of those kings [[king]], or rulers, who themselves transgressed not the bounds of
the [[public]] [[good]]: for prerogative is nothing but the [[power]] of doing
public [[good]] without a [[rule]].

sect. 167. the [[power]] of calling parliaments in [[england]], as to precise
time, place, and duration, is certainly a prerogative of the [[king]], but
still with this trust, that it shall be made use of for the [[good]] of the
nation, as the exigencies of the times [[time]], and variety of occasions [[occasion]], shall
require: for it being impossible to foresee which should always be the
fittest place for them to assemble in, and what the [[best]] season; the
choice of these was left with the executive [[power]], as might be most
subservient to the [[public]] [[good]], and [[best]] suit the ends of parliaments.

sect. 168. the old [[question]] will be [[asked]] in this matter of prerogative,
but who shall be [[judge]] when this [[power]] is made a [[right]] use of one
answer: between an executive [[power]] in being, with such a prerogative,
and a legislative that depends upon his will for their convening, there
can be no [[judge]] on [[earth]]; as there can be none between the legislative
and the [[people]], should either the executive, or the legislative, when
they have got the [[power]] in their hands, design, or go about to enslave
or [[destroy]] them. the [[people]] have no other remedy in this, as in all
other cases where they have no [[judge]] on [[earth]], but to appeal to [[heaven]]:
for the rulers, in such attempts, exercising a [[power]] the [[people]] never
put into their hands, (who can never be supposed to [[consent]] that any
body should [[rule]] over them for their harm) do that which they have not a
right to do. and where the [[body]] of the [[people]], or any [[single]] [[man]], is
deprived of their [[right]], or is under the exercise of a [[power]] without
right, and have no appeal on [[earth]], then they have a [[liberty]] to appeal
to [[heaven]], whenever they [[judge]] the cause of sufficient moment. and
therefore, though the [[people]] cannot be [[judge]], so as to have, by the
constitution of that [[society]], any superior [[power]], to determine and give
effective sentence in the case; yet they have, by a [[law]] antecedent and
paramount to all positive laws [[law]] of [[men]], reserved that ultimate
determination to themselves which belongs to all [[mankind]], where there
lies no appeal on [[earth]], viz. to [[judge]], whether they have just cause to
make their appeal to [[heaven]]. and this [[judgment]] they cannot part with, it
being out of a man's [[man]] [[power]] so to submit himself to another, as to give
him a [[liberty]] to [[destroy]] him; [[god]] and [[nature]] never allowing a [[man]] so to
abandon himself, as to neglect his own preservation: and since he cannot
take away his own [[life]], neither can he give another [[power]] to take it.
nor let any one [[think]], this lays a perpetual foundation for disorder;
for this operates not, till the inconveniency is so [[great]], that the
majority [[feel]] it, and are weary of it, and find a necessity to have it
amended. but this the executive [[power]], or [[wise]] princes [[prince]], never need come
in the danger of: and it is the thing, of all others, they have most
need to avoid, as of all others the most perilous.




chapter. xv.

of paternal, [[political]], and despotical [[power]], considered together.


sect. 169. though i have had [[occasion]] to speak of these separately
before, yet the [[great]] mistakes of late about [[government]], having, as i
suppose, arisen from confounding these distinct powers [[power]] one with another,
it may not, perhaps, be amiss to consider them here together.

sect. 170. first, then, paternal or parental [[power]] is nothing but that
which parents have over their [[children]], to govern them for the
children's [[good]], till they come to the use of [[reason]], or a [[state]] of
knowledge, wherein they may be supposed capable to [[understand]] that [[rule]],
whether it be the [[law]] of [[nature]], or the municipal [[law]] of their [[country]],
they are to govern themselves by: capable, i say, to [[know]] it, as well as
several others, who [[live]] as freemen under that [[law]]. the affection and
tenderness which [[god]] hath planted in the breast of parents towards their
children, makes it evident, that this is not intended to be a severe
arbitrary [[government]], but only for the [[help]], instruction, and
preservation of their offspring. but happen it as it will, there is, as
i have proved, no [[reason]] why it should be [[thought]] to extend to [[life]] and
death, at any [[time]], over their [[children]], more than over any [[body]] else;
neither can there be any pretence why this parental [[power]] should keep
the child, when grown to a [[man]], in subjection to the will of his
parents, any farther than having received [[life]] and [[education]] from his
parents, obliges him to [[respect]], [[honour]], gratitude, assistance and
support, all his [[life]], to both [[father]] and [[mother]]. and thus, 'tis true,
the paternal is a [[natural]] [[government]], but not at all extending itself to
the ends and jurisdictions of that which is [[political]]. the [[power]] of the
father doth not reach at all to the [[property]] of the child, which is only
in his own disposing.

sect. 171. secondly, [[political]] [[power]] is that [[power]], which every man
having in the [[state]] of [[nature]], has given up into the hands of the
society, and therein to the governors, whom the [[society]] hath set over
itself, with this express or tacit trust, that it shall be employed for
their [[good]], and the preservation of their [[property]]: now this [[power]],
which every [[man]] has in the [[state]] of [[nature]], and which he parts with to
the [[society]] in all such cases where the [[society]] can secure him, is to
use such means, for the preserving of his own [[property]], as he thinks
good, and [[nature]] allows him; and to punish the breach of the [[law]] of
nature in others, so as (according to the [[best]] of his reason) may most
conduce to the preservation of himself, and the rest of [[mankind]]. so that
the end and measure of this [[power]], when in every man's [[man]] hands in the
state of [[nature]], being the preservation of all of his [[society]], that is,
all [[mankind]] in general, it can have no other end or measure, when in the
hands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that [[society]] in
their lives [[life]], liberties [[liberty]], and possessions; and so cannot be an absolute,
arbitrary [[power]] over their lives [[life]] and fortunes [[fortune]], which are as much as
possible to be preserved; but a [[power]] to make laws [[law]], and annex such
penalties to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole, by
cutting off those parts, and those only, which are so [[corrupt]], that they
threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful. and
this [[power]] has its original only from compact and agreement, and the
mutual [[consent]] of those who make up the [[community]].

sect. 172. thirdly, despotical [[power]] is an absolute, arbitrary [[power]] one
man has over another, to take away his [[life]], whenever he pleases. this
is a [[power]], which neither [[nature]] gives, for it has made no such
distinction between one [[man]] and another; nor compact can convey: for man
not having such an arbitrary [[power]] over his own [[life]], cannot give
another [[man]] such a [[power]] over it; but it is the effect only of
forfeiture, which the aggressor makes of his own [[life]], when he puts
himself into the [[state]] of [[war]] with another: for having quitted [[reason]],
which [[god]] hath given to be the [[rule]] betwixt [[man]] and [[man]], and the common
bond whereby [[human]] [[kind]] is [[united]] into one fellowship and [[society]]; and
having renounced the way of [[peace]] which that teaches [[teach]], and made use of
the [[force]] of [[war]], to compass his [[unjust]] ends upon another, where he has
no [[right]]; and so revolting from his own [[kind]] to that of beasts, by
making [[force]], which is their's, to be his [[rule]] of [[right]], he renders
himself liable to be destroyed by the injured [[person]], and the rest of
mankind, that will join with him in the execution of [[justice]], as any
other wild beast, or noxious brute, with whom [[mankind]] can have neither
society nor security*. and thus captives, taken in a just and lawful
war, and such only, are [[subject]] to a despotical [[power]], which, as it
arises not from compact, so neither is it capable of any, but is the
state of [[war]] continued: for what compact can be made with a [[man]] that is
not master of his own [[life]]? what condition can he perform? and if he be
once allowed to be master of his own [[life]], the despotical, arbitrary
power of his master ceases. he that is master of himself, and his own
life, has a [[right]] too to the means of preserving it; so that as soon as
compact enters, [[slavery]] ceases, and he so far quits his absolute [[power]],
and puts an end to the [[state]] of [[war]], who enters into conditions with his
captive.

(*another copy corrected by mr. locke, has it thus, noxious brute that
is destructive to their being.)

sect. 173. [[nature]] gives the first of these, viz. paternal [[power]] to
parents for the benefit of their [[children]] during their minority, to
supply their want of ability, and understanding how to manage their
property. (by [[property]] i must be understood here, as in other places, to
mean that [[property]] which [[men]] have in their persons [[person]] as well as goods [[good]].)
voluntary agreement gives the second, viz. [[political]] [[power]] to governors
for the benefit of their subjects [[subject]], to secure them in the possession and
use of their properties [[property]]. and forfeiture gives the third despotical power
to lords [[lord]] for their own benefit, over those who are stripped of all
property.

sect. 174. he, that shall consider the distinct rise and extent, and the
different ends of these several powers [[power]], will plainly see, that paternal
power comes as far short of that of the magistrate, as despotical
exceeds it; and that absolute dominion, however placed, is so far from
being one [[kind]] of civil [[society]], that it is as inconsistent with it, as
slavery is with [[property]]. paternal [[power]] is only where minority makes
the child incapable to manage his [[property]]; [[political]], where [[men]] have
property in their own disposal; and despotical, over such as have no
property at all.




chapter. xvi.

of [[conquest]].


sect. 175. though governments [[government]] can originally have no other rise than
that before mentioned, nor polities be founded on any thing but the
consent of the [[people]]; yet such have been the disorders [[ambition]] has
filled the [[world]] with, that in the noise of [[war]], which makes so [[great]] a
part of the [[history]] of [[mankind]], this [[consent]] is little taken notice of:
and therefore many have mistaken the [[force]] of arms for the [[consent]] of
the [[people]], and reckon [[conquest]] as one of the originals of [[government]].
but [[conquest]] is as far from setting up any [[government]], as demolishing an
house is from building a new one in the place. indeed, it often makes
way for a new frame of a commonwealth, by destroying the former; but,
without the [[consent]] of the [[people]], can never erect a new one.

sect. 176. that the aggressor, who puts himself into the [[state]] of war
with another, and unjustly invades another man's [[man]] [[right]], can, by such an
unjust [[war]], never come to have a [[right]] over the conquered, will be
easily agreed by all [[men]], who will not [[think]], that robbers and pyrates
have a [[right]] of [[empire]] over whomsoever they have [[force]] enough to master;
or that [[men]] are bound by promises, which unlawful [[force]] extorts from
them. should a robber break into my house, and with a dagger at my
throat make me seal deeds to convey my estate to him, would this give
him any title? just such a title, by his [[sword]], has an [[unjust]] conqueror,
who forces [[force]] me into submission. the injury and the crime is [[equal]],
whether committed by the wearer of a [[crown]], or some petty villain. the
title of the offender, and the number of his followers, make no
difference in the offence, unless it be to aggravate it. the only
difference is, [[great]] robbers punish little ones, to keep them in their
obedience; but the [[great]] ones are rewarded with laurels and triumphs,
because they are too big for the [[weak]] hands of [[justice]] in this [[world]],
and have the [[power]] in their own possession, which should punish
offenders. what is my remedy against a robber, that so broke into my
house? appeal to the [[law]] for [[justice]]. but perhaps [[justice]] is denied, or
i am crippled and cannot stir, robbed and have not the means to do it.
if [[god]] has taken away all means of seeking remedy, there is nothing left
but patience. but my [[son]], when able, may seek the relief of the [[law]],
which i am denied: he or his [[son]] may renew his appeal, till he recover
his [[right]]. but the conquered, or their [[children]], have no court, no
arbitrator on [[earth]] to appeal to. then they may appeal, as jephtha did,
to [[heaven]], and repeat their appeal till they have recovered the native
right of their [[ancestors]], which was, to have such a legislative over
them, as the majority should approve, and freely acquiesce in. if it be
objected, this would cause endless trouble; i [[answer]], no more than
justice does, where she lies [[lie]] open to all that appeal to her. he that
troubles his neighbour without a cause, is punished for it by the
justice of the court he appeals to: and he that appeals to [[heaven]] must
be sure he has [[right]] on his side; and a [[right]] too that is worth the
trouble and cost of the appeal, as he will [[answer]] at a tribunal that
cannot be deceived, and will be sure to retribute to every one according
to the mischiefs he hath created to his fellow subjects [[subject]]; that is, any
part of [[mankind]]: from whence it is plain, that he that conquers in an
unjust [[war]] can thereby have no title to the subjection and [[obedience]] of
the conquered.

sect. 177. but supposing [[victory]] favours the [[right]] side, let us consider
a conqueror in a lawful [[war]], and see what [[power]] he gets, and over whom.

first, it is plain he gets no [[power]] by his [[conquest]] over those that
conquered with him. they that fought on his side cannot suffer by the
conquest, but must at least be as much freemen as they were before. and
most commonly they serve upon terms, and on condition to share with
their leader, and enjoy a part of the spoil, and other advantages that
attend the conquering [[sword]]; or at least have a part of the subdued
country bestowed upon them. and the conquering [[people]] are not, i [[hope]],
to be slaves [[slave]] by [[conquest]], and wear their laurels only to shew they are
sacrifices to their leaders triumph. they that found absolute monarchy
upon the title of the [[sword]], make their heroes, who are the founders of
such monarchies [[monarchy]], arrant draw-can-sirs, and forget they had any officers
and soldiers that fought on their side in the battles [[battle]] they won, or
assisted them in the subduing, or shared in possessing, the countries
they mastered. we are told by some, that the english [[monarchy]] is founded
in the norman [[conquest]], and that our princes [[prince]] have thereby a title to
absolute dominion: which if it were true, (as by the [[history]] it appears
otherwise) and that william had a [[right]] to make [[war]] on this island; yet
his dominion by [[conquest]] could reach no farther than to the saxons and
britons, that were then inhabitants of this [[country]]. the normans that
came with him, and helped to conquer, and all descended from them, are
freemen, and no subjects [[subject]] by [[conquest]]; let that give what dominion it
will. and if i, or any [[body]] else, shall claim [[freedom]], as derived from
them, it will be very hard to prove the contrary: and it is plain, the
law, that has made no distinction between the one and the other, intends
not there should be any difference in their [[freedom]] or privileges [[privilege]].

sect. 178. but supposing, which seldom happens, that the conquerors and
conquered never incorporate into one [[people]], under the same laws [[law]] and
freedom; let us see next what [[power]] a lawful conqueror has over the
subdued: and that i say is purely despotical. he has an absolute power
over the lives [[life]] of those who by an [[unjust]] [[war]] have forfeited them; but
not over the lives [[life]] or fortunes [[fortune]] of those who engaged not in the [[war]], nor
over the possessions even of those who were actually engaged in it.

sect. 179. secondly, i say then the conqueror gets no [[power]] but only
over those who have actually assisted, concurred, or consented to that
unjust [[force]] that is used against him: for the [[people]] having given to
their governors no [[power]] to do an [[unjust]] thing, such as is to make an
unjust [[war]], (for they never had such a [[power]] in themselves) they ought
not to be charged as guilty of the [[violence]] and unjustice that is
committed in an [[unjust]] [[war]], any farther than they actually abet it; no
more than they are to be [[thought]] guilty of any [[violence]] or oppression
their governors should use upon the [[people]] themselves, or any part of
their fellow subjects [[subject]], they having empowered them no more to the one
than to the other. conquerors, it is true, seldom trouble themselves to
make the distinction, but they willingly permit the confusion of [[war]] to
sweep all together: but yet this alters not the [[right]]; for the
conquerors [[power]] over the lives [[life]] of the conquered, being only because
they have used [[force]] to do, or maintain an [[injustice]], he can have that
power only over those who have concurred in that [[force]]; all the rest are
innocent; and he has no more title over the [[people]] of that [[country]], who
have done him no injury, and so have made no forfeiture of their lives [[life]],
than he has over any other, who, without any injuries or provocations,
have lived upon [[fair]] terms with him.

sect. 180. thirdly, the [[power]] a conqueror gets over those he overcomes
in a just [[war]], is perfectly despotical: he has an absolute [[power]] over
the lives [[life]] of those, who, by putting themselves in a [[state]] of [[war]], have
forfeited them; but he has not thereby a [[right]] and title to their
possessions. this i [[doubt]] not, but at first sight will seem a strange
doctrine, it being so quite contrary to the practice of the [[world]]; there
being nothing more familiar in speaking of the dominion of countries [[country]],
than to say such an one conquered it; as if [[conquest]], without any more
ado, conveyed a [[right]] of possession. but when we consider, that the
practice of the [[strong]] and powerful, how universal soever it may be, is
seldom the [[rule]] of [[right]], however it be one part of the subjection of
the conquered, not to argue against the conditions cut out to them by
the conquering [[sword]].

sect. 181. though in all [[war]] there be usually a complication of force
and damage, and the aggressor seldom fails to harm the estate, when he
uses [[force]] against the persons [[person]] of those he makes [[war]] upon; yet it is the
use of [[force]] only that puts a [[man]] into the [[state]] of [[war]]: for whether by
force he begins the injury, or else having quietly, and by fraud, done
the injury, he refuses to make reparation, and by [[force]] maintains it,
(which is the same thing, as at first to have done it by force) it is
the [[unjust]] use of [[force]] that makes the [[war]]: for he that breaks open my
house, and violently turns me out of doors; or having peaceably got in,
by [[force]] keeps me out, does in effect the same thing; supposing we are
in such a [[state]], that we have no [[common]] [[judge]] on [[earth]], whom i may
appeal to, and to whom we are both obliged to submit: for of such i am
now speaking. it is the [[unjust]] use of [[force]] then, that puts a [[man]] into
the [[state]] of [[war]] with another; and thereby he that is guilty of it makes
a forfeiture of his [[life]]: for quitting [[reason]], which is the [[rule]] given
between [[man]] and [[man]], and using [[force]], the way of beasts, he becomes
liable to be destroyed by him he uses [[force]] against, as any savage
ravenous beast, that is dangerous to his being.

sect. 182. but because the miscarriages of the [[father]] are no faults [[fault]] of
the [[children]], and they may be [[rational]] and peaceable, notwithstanding
the brutishness and [[injustice]] of the [[father]]; the [[father]], by his
miscarriages and [[violence]], can forfeit but his own [[life]], but involves
not his [[children]] in his guilt or destruction. his goods [[good]], which [[nature]],
that willeth the preservation of all [[mankind]] as much as is possible,
hath made to belong to the [[children]] to keep them from perishing, do
still continue to belong to his [[children]]: for supposing them not to have
joined in the [[war]], either thro' infancy, absence, or [[choice]], they have
done nothing to forfeit them: nor has the conqueror any [[right]] to take
them away, by the bare title of having subdued him that by force
attempted his destruction; though perhaps he may have some [[right]] to
them, to repair the damages he has sustained by the [[war]], and the defence
of his own [[right]]; which how far it reaches to the possessions of the
conquered, we shall see by and by. so that he that by [[conquest]] has a
right over a man's [[man]] [[person]] to [[destroy]] him if he pleases, has not thereby
a [[right]] over his estate to possess and enjoy it: for it is the brutal
force the aggressor has used, that gives his adversary a [[right]] to take
away his [[life]], and [[destroy]] him if he pleases, as a noxious creature; but
it is damage sustained that alone gives him title to another man's
goods: for though i may kill a thief that sets on me in the highway, yet
i may not (which seems less) take away his [[money]], and let him go: this
would be robbery on my side. his [[force]], and the [[state]] of [[war]] he put
himself in, made him forfeit his [[life]], but gave me no title to his
goods. the [[right]] then of [[conquest]] extends only to the lives [[life]] of those who
joined in the [[war]], not to their estates, but only in order to make
reparation for the damages received, and the charges of the [[war]], and
that too with reservation of the [[right]] of the [[innocent]] [[wife]] and
children.

sect. 183. let the conqueror have as much [[justice]] on his side, as could
be supposed, he has no [[right]] to seize more than the vanquished could
forfeit: his [[life]] is at the victor's [[mercy]]; and his service and goods [[good]] he
may appropriate, to make himself reparation; but he cannot take the
goods of his [[wife]] and [[children]]; they too had a title to the goods [[good]] he
enjoyed, and their shares in the estate he possessed: for [[example]], i in
the [[state]] of [[nature]] (and all commonwealths are in the [[state]] of nature
one with another) have injured another [[man]], and refusing to give
satisfaction, it comes to a [[state]] of [[war]], wherein my defending by force
what i had gotten unjustly, makes me the aggressor. i am conquered: my
life, it is true, as forfeit, is at [[mercy]], but not my wife's and
children's. they made not the [[war]], nor assisted in it. i could not
forfeit their lives [[life]]; they were not mine to forfeit. my [[wife]] had a share
in my estate; that neither could i forfeit. and my [[children]] also, being
born of me, had a [[right]] to be maintained out of my [[labour]] or substance.
here then is the case: the conqueror has a title to reparation for
damages received, and the [[children]] have a title to their father's estate
for their subsistence: for as to the wife's share, whether her own
labour, or compact, gave her a title to it, it is plain, her husband
could not forfeit what was her's. what must be done in the case? i
answer; the fundamental [[law]] of [[nature]] being, that all, as much as may
be, should be preserved, it follows, that if there be not enough fully
to satisfy both, viz, for the conqueror's losses, and children's
maintenance, he that hath, and to spare, must remit something of his
full satisfaction, and give way to the pressing and preferable title of
those who are in danger to perish without it.

sect. 184. but supposing the charge and damages of the [[war]] are to be
made up to the conqueror, to the utmost farthing; and that the children
of the vanquished, spoiled of all their father's goods [[good]], are to be left
to starve and perish; yet the satisfying of what shall, on this score,
be due to the conqueror, will scarce give him a title to any [[country]] he
shall conquer: for the damages of [[war]] can scarce amount to the value of
any considerable tract of [[land]], in any part of the [[world]], where all the
land is possessed, and none lies [[lie]] waste. and if i have not taken away the
conqueror's [[land]], which, being vanquished, it is impossible i should;
scarce any other spoil i have done him can amount to the value of mine,
supposing it equally cultivated, and of an extent any way coming near
what i had overrun of his. the destruction of a year's product or two
(for it seldom reaches four or five) is the utmost spoil that usually
can be done: for as to [[money]], and such riches [[rich]] and treasure taken away,
these are none of nature's goods [[good]], they have but a fantastical imaginary
value: [[nature]] has put no such upon them: they are of no more account by
her standard, than the wampompeke of the americans to an european
prince, or the silver [[money]] of [[europe]] would have been formerly to an
american. and five years product is not worth the perpetual inheritance
of [[land]], where all is possessed, and none remains waste, to be taken up
by him that is disseized: which will be easily granted, if one do but
take away the imaginary value of [[money]], the disproportion being more
than between five and five hundred; though, at the same [[time]], half a
year's product is more worth than the [[inheritance]], where there being
more [[land]] than the inhabitants possess and make use of, any one has
liberty to make use of the waste: but there conquerors take little care
to possess themselves of the lands [[land]] of the vanquished, no damage
therefore, that [[men]] in the [[state]] of [[nature]] (as all princes [[prince]] and
governments are in reference to one another) suffer from one another,
can give a conqueror [[power]] to dispossess the [[posterity]] of the
vanquished, and turn them out of that [[inheritance]], which ought to be the
possession of them and their descendants to all generations [[generation]]. the
conqueror indeed will be apt to [[think]] himself master: and it is the very
condition of the subdued not to be able to dispute their [[right]]. but if
that be all, it gives no other title than what bare [[force]] gives to the
stronger over the weaker: and, by this [[reason]], he that is strongest will
have a [[right]] to whatever he pleases to seize on.

sect. 185. over those then that joined with him in the [[war]], and over
those of the subdued [[country]] that opposed him not, and the posterity
even of those that did, the conqueror, even in a just [[war]], hath, by his
conquest, no [[right]] of dominion: they are [[free]] from any subjection to
him, and if their former [[government]] be dissolved, they are at [[liberty]] to
begin and erect another to themselves.

sect. 186. the conqueror, it is true, usually, by the [[force]] he has over
them, compels them, with a [[sword]] at their breasts, to stoop to his
conditions, and submit to such a [[government]] as he pleases to afford
them; but the enquiry is, what [[right]] he has to do so? if it be said,
they submit by their own [[consent]], then this allows their own [[consent]] to
be necessary to give the conqueror a title to [[rule]] over them. it remains
only to be considered, whether promises extorted by [[force]], without
right, can be [[thought]] [[consent]], and how far they bind. to which i shall
say, they bind not at all; because whatsoever another gets from me by
force, i still retain the [[right]] of, and he is obliged presently to
restore. he that forces [[force]] my horse from me, ought presently to restore
him, and i have still a [[right]] to retake him. by the same [[reason]], he that
forced a promise from me, ought presently to restore it, i.e. quit me of
the obligation of it; or i may resume it myself, i.e. chuse whether i
will perform it: for the [[law]] of [[nature]] laying an obligation on me only
by the rules [[rule]] she prescribes, cannot oblige me by the violation of her
rules: such is the extorting any thing from me by [[force]]. nor does it at
all alter the case to say, i gave my promise, no more than it excuses
the [[force]], and passes the [[right]], when i put my hand in my pocket, and
deliver my purse myself to a thief, who demands it with a pistol at my
breast.

sect. 187. from all which it follows, that the [[government]] of a
conqueror, imposed by [[force]] on the subdued, against whom he had no right
of [[war]], or who joined not in the [[war]] against him, where he had [[right]],
has no obligation upon them.

sect. 188. but let us suppose, that all the [[men]] of that [[community]], being
all members of the same [[body]] [[politic]], may be taken to have joined in
that [[unjust]] [[war]] wherein they are subdued, and so their lives [[life]] are at the
mercy of the conqueror.

sect. 189. i say this concerns not their [[children]] who are in their
minority: for since a [[father]] hath not, in himself, a [[power]] over the life
or [[liberty]] of his child, no act of his can possibly forfeit it. so that
the [[children]], whatever may have happened to the fathers [[father]], are freemen,
and the absolute [[power]] of the conqueror reaches no farther than the
persons of the [[men]] that were subdued by him, and dies with them: and
should he govern them as slaves [[slave]], subjected to his absolute arbitrary
power, he has no such [[right]] of dominion over their [[children]]. he can have
no [[power]] over them but by their own [[consent]], whatever he may drive them
to say or do; and he has no lawfull [[authority]], whilst [[force]], and not
choice, compels them to submission.

sect. 190. every [[man]] is born with a double [[right]]: first, a [[right]] of
freedom to his [[person]], which no other [[man]] has a [[power]] over, but the free
disposal of it lies [[lie]] in himself. secondly, a [[right]], before any other [[man]],
to inherit with his brethren [[brother]] his father's goods [[good]].

sect. 191. by the first of these, a [[man]] is naturally [[free]] from
subjection to any [[government]], tho' he be born in a place under its
jurisdiction; but if he disclaim the lawful [[government]] of the [[country]] he
was born in, he must also quit the [[right]] that belonged to him by the
laws of it, and the possessions there descending to him from his
ancestors, if it were a [[government]] made by their [[consent]].

sect. 192. by the second, the inhabitants of any [[country]], who are
descended, and derive a title to their estates from those who are
subdued, and had a [[government]] forced upon them against their free
consents, retain a [[right]] to the possession of their [[ancestors]], though
they [[consent]] not freely to the [[government]], whose hard conditions were by
force imposed on the possessors of that [[country]]: for the first conqueror
never having had a title to the [[land]] of that [[country]], the [[people]] who are
the descendants of, or claim under those who were forced to submit to
the yoke of a [[government]] by constraint, have always a [[right]] to shake it
off, and [[free]] themselves from the usurpation or [[tyranny]] which the sword
hath brought in upon them, till their rulers put them under such a frame
of [[government]] as they willingly and of [[choice]] [[consent]] to. who doubts [[doubt]] but
the grecian christians [[christian]], descendants of the ancient possessors of that
country, may justly cast off the turkish yoke, which they have so long
groaned under, whenever they have an opportunity to do it? for no
government can have a [[right]] to [[obedience]] from a [[people]] who have not
freely consented to it; which they can never be supposed to do, till
either they are put in a full [[state]] of [[liberty]] to chuse their government
and governors, or at least till they have such standing laws [[law]], to which
they have by themselves or their representatives given their free
consent, and also till they are allowed their due [[property]], which is so
to be proprietors of what they have, that no [[body]] can take away any part
of it without their own [[consent]], without which, [[men]] under any government
are not in the [[state]] of freemen, but are direct slaves [[slave]] under the force
of [[war]].

sect. 193. but granting that the conqueror in a just [[war]] has a [[right]] to
the estates, as well as [[power]] over the persons [[person]], of the conquered; which,
it is plain, he hath not: nothing of absolute [[power]] will [[follow]] from
hence, in the continuance of the [[government]]; because the descendants of
these being all freemen, if he grants them estates and possessions to
inhabit his [[country]], (without which it would be worth nothing)
whatsoever he grants them, they have, so far as it is granted, property
in. the [[nature]] whereof is, that without a man's [[man]] own [[consent]] it cannot be
taken from him.

sect. 194. their persons [[person]] are [[free]] by a native [[right]], and their
properties, be they more or less, are their own, and at their own
dispose, and not at his; or else it is no [[property]]. supposing the
conqueror gives to one [[man]] a thousand acres, to him and his heirs for
ever; to another he lets a thousand acres for his [[life]], under the rent
of 50_l_. or 500_l_. per ann. has not the one of these a [[right]] to his
thousand acres for ever, and the other, during his [[life]], paying the said
rent? and hath not the tenant for [[life]] a [[property]] in all that he gets
over and above his rent, by his [[labour]] and industry during the said
term, supposing it be double the rent? can any one say, the [[king]], or
conqueror, after his grant, may by his [[power]] of conqueror take away all,
or part of the [[land]] from the heirs of one, or from the other during his
life, he paying the rent? or can he take away from either the goods [[good]] or
money they have got upon the said [[land]], at his [[pleasure]]? if he can, then
all [[free]] and voluntary contracts cease, and are void in the [[world]]; there
needs nothing to dissolve them at any [[time]], but [[power]] enough: and all
the grants and promises of [[men]] in [[power]] are but mockery and collusion:
for can there be any thing more ridiculous than to say, i give you and
your's this for ever, and that in the surest and most solemn way of
conveyance can be devised; and yet it is to be understood, that i have
right, if i please, to take it away from you again to morrow?

sect. 195. i will not dispute now whether princes [[prince]] are exempt from the
laws of their [[country]]; but this i am sure, they owe subjection to the
laws of [[god]] and [[nature]]. no [[body]], no [[power]], can exempt them from the
obligations of that eternal [[law]]. those are so [[great]], and so [[strong]], in
the case of promises, that omnipotency itself can be tied by them.
grants, promises, and oaths, are bonds that hold the almighty: whatever
some flatterers say to princes [[prince]] of the [[world]], who all together, with all
their [[people]] joined to them, are, in comparison of the [[great]] [[god]], but as
a drop of the bucket, or a dust on the balance, inconsiderable, nothing!

sect. 196. the short of the case in [[conquest]] is this: the conqueror, if
he have a just cause, has a despotical [[right]] over the persons [[person]] of all,
that actually aided, and concurred in the [[war]] against him, and a right
to make up his damage and cost out of their [[labour]] and estates, so he
injure not the [[right]] of any other. over the rest of the [[people]], if there
were any that consented not to the [[war]], and over the [[children]] of the
captives themselves, or the possessions of either, he has no [[power]]; and
so can have, by [[virtue]] of [[conquest]], no lawful title himself to dominion
over them, or derive it to his [[posterity]]; but is an aggressor, if he
attempts upon their properties [[property]], and thereby puts himself in a [[state]] of
war against them, and has no [[better]] a [[right]] of principality, he, nor any
of his successors, than hingar, or hubba, the danes, had here in
england; or spartacus, had he conquered [[italy]], would have had; which is
to have their yoke cast off, as soon as [[god]] shall give those under their
subjection [[courage]] and opportunity to do it. thus, notwithstanding
whatever title the kings [[king]] of assyria had over judah, by the [[sword]], god
assisted hezekiah to throw off the dominion of that conquering [[empire]].
and the [[lord]] was with hezekiah, and he prospered; wherefore he went
forth, and he rebelled against the [[king]] of assyria, and served him not,
2 kings [[king]] xviii. 7. whence it is plain, that shaking off a [[power]], which
force, and not [[right]], hath set over any one, though it hath the name of
rebellion, yet is no offence before [[god]], but is that which he allows and
countenances, though even promises and covenants, when obtained by
force, have intervened: for it is very probable, to any one that reads
the story of ahaz and hezekiah attentively, that the assyrians subdued
ahaz, and deposed him, and made hezekiah [[king]] in his father's lifetime;
and that hezekiah by agreement had done him homage, and paid him tribute
all this [[time]].




chapter. xvii.

of usurpation.


sect. 197. as [[conquest]] may be called a [[foreign]] usurpation, so usurpation
is a [[kind]] of domestic [[conquest]], with this difference, that an usurper
can never have [[right]] on his side, it being no usurpation, but where one
is got into the possession of what another has [[right]] to. this, so far as
it is usurpation, is a [[change]] only of persons [[person]], but not of the forms and
rules of the [[government]]: for if the usurper extend his [[power]] beyond what
of [[right]] belonged to the lawful princes [[prince]], or governors of the
commonwealth, it is [[tyranny]] added to usurpation.

sect. 198. in all lawful governments [[government]], the designation of the persons [[person]],
who are to bear [[rule]], is as [[natural]] and necessary a part as the form of
the [[government]] itself, and is that which had its establishment
originally from the [[people]]; the [[anarchy]] being much alike, to have no
form of [[government]] at all; or to agree, that it shall be monarchical,
but to appoint no way to design the [[person]] that shall have the [[power]],
and be the monarch. hence all commonwealths, with the form of government
established, have rules [[rule]] also of appointing those who are to have any
share in the [[public]] [[authority]], and settled methods of conveying the
right to them: for the [[anarchy]] is much alike, to have no form of
government at all; or to agree that it shall be monarchical, but to
appoint no way to [[know]] or design the [[person]] that shall have the [[power]],
and be the monarch. whoever gets into the exercise of any part of the
power, by other ways than what the laws [[law]] of the [[community]] have
prescribed, hath no [[right]] to be obeyed, though the form of the
commonwealth be still preserved; since he is not the [[person]] the laws
have appointed, and consequently not the [[person]] the [[people]] have
consented to. nor can such an usurper, or any deriving from him, ever
have a title, till the [[people]] are both at [[liberty]] to [[consent]], and have
actually consented to allow, and confirm in him the [[power]] he hath till
then usurped.




chapter. xviii.

of [[tyranny]].


sect. 199. as usurpation is the exercise of [[power]], which another hath a
right to; so [[tyranny]] is the exercise of [[power]] beyond [[right]], which no
body can have a [[right]] to. and this is making use of the [[power]] any one
has in his hands, not for the [[good]] of those who are under it, but for
his own private separate advantage. when the governor, however intitled,
makes not the [[law]], but his will, the [[rule]]; and his commands and actions
are not directed to the preservation of the properties [[property]] of his [[people]],
but the satisfaction of his own [[ambition]], [[revenge]], covetousness, or any
other irregular passion.

sect. 200. if one can [[doubt]] this to be [[truth]], or [[reason]], because it
comes from the obscure hand of a [[subject]], i [[hope]] the [[authority]] of a king
will make it pass with him. [[king]] james the first, in his [[speech]] to the
parliament, 1603, tells them thus,

/#
     i will ever prefer the weal of the [[public]], and of the whole
     commonwealth, in making of [[good]] laws [[law]] and constitutions [[constitution]], to any
     particular and private ends of mine; thinking ever the [[wealth]] and
     weal of the commonwealth to be my [[greatest]] weal and worldly
     felicity; a point wherein a lawful [[king]] doth directly differ from a
     [[tyrant]]: for i do acknowledge, that the special and [[greatest]] point
     of difference that is between a rightful [[king]] and an usurping
     [[tyrant]], is this, that whereas the proud and ambitious [[tyrant]] doth
     [[think]] his [[kingdom]] and [[people]] are only ordained for satisfaction of
     his desires [[desire]] and unreasonable appetites, the righteous and just king
     doth by the contrary acknowledge himself to be ordained for the
     procuring of the [[wealth]] and [[property]] of his [[people]].
#/

and again, in his [[speech]] to the [[parliament]], 1609, he hath these words:

/#
     the [[king]] binds himself by a double oath, to the observation of the
     fundamental laws [[law]] of his [[kingdom]]; tacitly, as by being a [[king]], and
     so bound to [[protect]] as well the [[people]], as the laws [[law]] of his [[kingdom]];
     and expressly, by his oath at his coronation, so as every just
     [[king]], in a settled [[kingdom]], is bound to observe that paction made
     to his [[people]], by his laws [[law]], in framing his [[government]] agreeable
     thereunto, according to that paction which [[god]] made with noah after
     the deluge. hereafter, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat,
     and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease while the
     [[earth]] remaineth. and therefore a [[king]] governing in a settled
     [[kingdom]], leaves to be a [[king]], and degenerates into a [[tyrant]], as
     soon as he leaves off to [[rule]] according to his laws [[law]].
#/

and a little after,

/#
     therefore all kings [[king]] that are not tyrants [[tyrant]], or perjured, will be glad
     to bound themselves within the limits of their laws [[law]]; and they that
     persuade them the contrary, are vipers, and pests both against them
     and the commonwealth.
#/

thus that learned [[king]], who well understood the notion of things, makes
the difference betwixt a [[king]] and a [[tyrant]] to consist only in this, that
one makes the laws [[law]] the bounds of his [[power]], and the [[good]] of the [[public]],
the end of his [[government]]; the other makes all give way to his own will
and appetite.

sect. 201. it is a mistake, to [[think]] this [[fault]] is proper only to
monarchies; other forms of [[government]] are liable to it, as well as that:
for wherever the [[power]], that is put in any hands for the [[government]] of
the [[people]], and the preservation of their properties [[property]], is applied to
other ends, and made use of to impoverish, harass, or subdue them to the
arbitrary and irregular commands of those that have it; there it
presently becomes [[tyranny]], whether those that thus use it are one or
many. thus we [[read]] of the thirty tyrants [[tyrant]] at [[athens]], as well as one at
syracuse; and the intolerable dominion of the decemviri at [[rome]] was
nothing [[better]].

sect. 202. where-ever [[law]] ends, [[tyranny]] begins, if the [[law]] be
transgressed to another's harm; and whosoever in [[authority]] exceeds the
power given him by the [[law]], and makes use of the [[force]] he has under his
command, to compass that upon the [[subject]], which the [[law]] allows not,
ceases in that to be a magistrate; and, acting without [[authority]], may be
opposed, as any other [[man]], who by [[force]] invades the [[right]] of another.
this is acknowledged in subordinate magistrates. he that hath authority
to seize my [[person]] in the street, may be opposed as a thief and a
robber, if he endeavours to break into my house to execute a writ,
notwithstanding that i [[know]] he has such a warrant, and such a legal
authority, as will impower him to arrest me abroad. and why this should
not hold in the highest, as well as in the most inferior magistrate, i
would gladly be informed. is it reasonable, that the eldest [[brother]],
because he has the [[greatest]] part of his father's estate, should thereby
have a [[right]] to take away any of his younger brothers [[brother]] portions? or that
a [[rich]] [[man]], who possessed a whole [[country]], should from thence have a
right to seize, when he pleased, the cottage and garden of his poor
neighbour? the being rightfully possessed of [[great]] [[power]] and riches [[rich]],
exceedingly beyond the [[greatest]] part of the sons [[son]] of adam, is so far from
being an excuse, much less a [[reason]], for rapine and oppression, which
the endamaging another without [[authority]] is, that it is a great
aggravation of it: for the exceeding the bounds of [[authority]] is no more
a [[right]] in a [[great]], than in a petty officer; no more justifiable in a
king than a constable; but is so much the worse in him, in that he has
more trust put in him, has already a much greater share than the rest of
his brethren [[brother]], and is supposed, from the advantages of his [[education]],
employment, and counsellors, to be more knowing in the measures of right
and [[wrong]].

sect. 203. may the commands then of a [[prince]] be opposed? may he be
resisted as often as any one shall find himself aggrieved, and but
imagine he has not [[right]] done him? this will unhinge and overturn all
polities, and, instead of [[government]] and order, leave nothing but
anarchy and confusion.

sect. 204. to this i [[answer]], that [[force]] is to be opposed to nothing, but
to [[unjust]] and unlawful [[force]]; whoever makes any opposition in any other
case, draws on himself a just condemnation both from [[god]] and [[man]]; and so
no such danger or confusion will [[follow]], as is often suggested: for,

sect. 205. first, as, in some countries [[country]], the [[person]] of the [[prince]] by the
law is [[sacred]]; and so, whatever he commands or does, his [[person]] is still
free from all [[question]] or [[violence]], not liable to [[force]], or any judicial
censure or condemnation. but yet opposition may be made to the illegal
acts of any inferior officer, or other commissioned by him; unless he
will, by actually putting himself into a [[state]] of [[war]] with his [[people]],
dissolve the [[government]], and leave them to that defence which belongs to
every one in the [[state]] of [[nature]]: for of such things who can tell what
the end will be? and a neighbour [[kingdom]] has shewed the [[world]] an odd
example. in all other cases the sacredness of the [[person]] exempts him
from all inconveniencies, whereby he is secure, whilst the government
stands, from all [[violence]] and harm whatsoever; than which there cannot
be a wiser [[constitution]]: for the harm he can do in his own [[person]] not
being likely to happen often, nor to extend itself far; nor being able
by his [[single]] [[strength]] to subvert the laws [[law]], nor [[oppress]] the [[body]] of the
people, should any [[prince]] have so much weakness, and ill [[nature]] as to be
willing to do it, the inconveniency of some particular mischiefs, that
may happen sometimes, when a heady [[prince]] comes to the [[throne]], are well
recompensed by the [[peace]] of the [[public]], and security of the [[government]],
in the [[person]] of the [[chief]] magistrate, thus set out of the reach of
danger: it being safer for the [[body]], that some few private [[men]] should be
sometimes in danger to suffer, than that the head of the [[republic]] should
be easily, and upon slight occasions [[occasion]], exposed.

sect. 206. secondly, but this [[privilege]], belonging only to the king's
person, hinders not, but they may be questioned, opposed, and resisted,
who use [[unjust]] [[force]], though they pretend a commission from him, which
the [[law]] authorizes not; as is plain in the case of him that has the
king's writ to arrest a [[man]], which is a full commission from the [[king]];
and yet he that has it cannot break open a man's [[man]] house to do it, nor
execute this command of the [[king]] upon [[certain]] days, nor in certain
places, though this commission have no such exception in it; but they
are the limitations of the [[law]], which if any one transgress, the king's
commission excuses him not: for the king's [[authority]] being given him
only by the [[law]], he cannot impower any one to act against the [[law]], or
justify him, by his commission, in so doing; the commission, or command
of any magistrate, where he has no [[authority]], being as void and
insignificant, as that of any private [[man]]; the difference between the
one and the other, being that the magistrate has some [[authority]] so far,
and to such ends, and the private [[man]] has none at all: for it is not the
commission, but the [[authority]], that gives the [[right]] of acting; and
against the laws [[law]] there can be no [[authority]]. but, notwithstanding such
resistance, the king's [[person]] and [[authority]] are still both secured, and
so no danger to governor or [[government]].

sect. 207. thirdly, supposing a [[government]] wherein the [[person]] of the
chief magistrate is not thus [[sacred]]; yet this doctrine of the lawfulness
of resisting all unlawful exercises of his [[power]], will not upon every
slight [[occasion]] indanger him, or imbroil the [[government]]: for where the
injured party may be relieved, and his damages repaired by appeal to the
law, there can be no pretence for [[force]], which is only to be used where
a [[man]] is intercepted from appealing to the [[law]]: for nothing is to be
accounted hostile [[force]], but where it leaves not the remedy of such an
appeal; and it is such [[force]] alone, that puts him that uses it into a
state of [[war]], and makes it lawful to resist him. a [[man]] with a [[sword]] in
his hand demands my purse in the high-way, when perhaps i have not
twelve pence in my pocket: this [[man]] i may lawfully kill. to another i
deliver 100 pounds to hold only whilst i alight, which he refuses to
restore me, when i am got up again, but draws his [[sword]] to defend the
possession of it by [[force]], if i endeavour to retake it. the mischief
this [[man]] does me is a hundred, or possibly a thousand times [[time]] more than
the other perhaps intended me (whom i killed before he really did me
any); and yet i might lawfully kill the one, and cannot so much as hurt
the other lawfully. the [[reason]] whereof is plain; because the one using
force, which threatened my [[life]], i could not have [[time]] to appeal to the
law to secure it: and when it was gone, it was too late to appeal. the
law could not restore [[life]] to my [[dead]] carcass: the loss was irreparable;
which to prevent, the [[law]] of [[nature]] gave me a [[right]] to [[destroy]] him, who
had put himself into a [[state]] of [[war]] with me, and threatened my
destruction. but in the other case, my [[life]] not being in danger, i may
have the benefit of appealing to the [[law]], and have reparation for my 100
pounds that way.

sect. 208. fourthly, but if the unlawful acts done by the magistrate be
maintained (by the [[power]] he has got), and the remedy which is due by
law, be by the same [[power]] obstructed; yet the [[right]] of resisting, even
in such manifest acts of [[tyranny]], will not suddenly, or on slight
occasions, disturb the [[government]]: for if it reach no farther than some
private men's cases, though they have a [[right]] to defend themselves, and
to recover by [[force]] what by unlawful [[force]] is taken from them; yet the
right to do so will not easily engage them in a contest, wherein they
are sure to perish; it being as impossible for one, or a few oppressed
men to disturb the [[government]], where the [[body]] of the [[people]] do not think
themselves concerned in it, as for a raving mad-man, or heady malcontent
to overturn a well settled [[state]]; the [[people]] being as little apt to
follow the one, as the other.

sect. 209. but if either these illegal acts have extended to the
majority of the [[people]]; or if the mischief and oppression has lighted
only on some few, but in such cases, as the precedent, and consequences
seem to threaten all; and they are persuaded in their consciences, that
their laws [[law]], and with them their estates, liberties [[liberty]], and lives [[life]] are in
danger, and perhaps their [[religion]] too; how they will be hindered from
resisting illegal [[force]], used against them, i cannot tell. this is an
inconvenience, i confess, that attends all governments [[government]] whatsoever, when
the governors have brought it to this pass, to be generally suspected of
their [[people]]; the most dangerous [[state]] which they can possibly put
themselves in, wherein they are the less to be pitied, because it is so
easy to be avoided; it being as impossible for a governor, if he really
means the [[good]] of his [[people]], and the preservation of them, and their
laws together, not to make them see and [[feel]] it, as it is for the father
of a [[family]], not to let his [[children]] see he loves [[love]], and takes [[care]] of
them.

sect. 210. but if all the [[world]] shall observe pretences of one [[kind]], and
actions of another; [[arts]] used to elude the [[law]], and the trust of
prerogative (which is an arbitrary [[power]] in some things left in the
prince's hand to do [[good]], not harm to the people) employed contrary to
the end for which it was given: if the [[people]] shall find the ministers
and subordinate magistrates chosen suitable to such ends, and favoured,
or laid by, proportionably as they promote or oppose them: if they see
several experiments made of arbitrary [[power]], and that [[religion]] underhand
favoured, (tho' publicly proclaimed against) which is readiest to
introduce it; and the operators in it supported, as much as may be; and
when that cannot be done, yet approved still, and liked the [[better]]: if a
long train of actions shew the councils all tending that way; how can a
man any more hinder himself from being persuaded in his own [[mind]], which
way things are going; or from casting about how to save himself, than he
could from believing the captain of the ship he was in, was carrying
him, and the rest of the company, to algiers, when he found him always
steering that course, though cross winds, leaks in his ship, and want of
men and provisions did often [[force]] him to turn his course another way
for some [[time]], which he steadily returned to again, as soon as the wind,
weather, and other circumstances would let him?




chapter. xix.

of the dissolution of [[government]].


sect. 211. he that will with any clearness speak of the dissolution of
government, ought in the first place to distinguish between the
dissolution of the [[society]] and the dissolution of the [[government]]. that
which makes the [[community]], and brings [[men]] out of the loose [[state]] of
nature, into one [[politic]] [[society]], is the agreement which every one has
with the rest to incorporate, and act as one [[body]], and so be one
distinct commonwealth. the usual, and almost only way whereby this
union is dissolved, is the inroad of [[foreign]] [[force]] making a conquest
upon them: for in that case, (not being able to maintain and support
themselves, as one intire and independent body) the union belonging to
that [[body]] which consisted therein, must necessarily cease, and so every
one return to the [[state]] he was in before, with a [[liberty]] to shift for
himself, and provide for his own safety, as he thinks [[think]] fit, in some other
society. whenever the [[society]] is dissolved, it is [[certain]] the government
of that [[society]] cannot remain. thus conquerors swords [[sword]] often cut up
governments by the roots, and mangle societies [[society]] to pieces, separating the
subdued or scattered multitude from the protection of, and dependence
on, that [[society]] which ought to have preserved them from [[violence]]. the
world is too well instructed in, and too forward to allow of, this way
of dissolving of governments [[government]], to need any more to be said of it; and
there wants not much argument to prove, that where the [[society]] is
dissolved, the [[government]] cannot remain; that being as impossible, as
for the frame of an house to subsist when the materials of it are
scattered and dissipated by a whirl-wind, or jumbled into a confused
heap by an earthquake.

sect. 212. besides this over-turning from without, governments [[government]] are
dissolved from within.

first, when the legislative is altered. civil [[society]] being a [[state]] of
peace, amongst those who are of it, from whom the [[state]] of [[war]] is
excluded by the umpirage, which they have provided in their legislative,
for the ending all differences that may arise amongst any of them, it is
in their legislative, that the members of a commonwealth are [[united]], and
combined together into one coherent living [[body]]. this is the [[soul]] that
gives form, [[life]], and unity, to the commonwealth: from hence the
several members have their mutual influence, sympathy, and connexion:
and therefore, when the legislative is broken, or dissolved, dissolution
and [[death]] follows: for the essence and union of the [[society]] consisting
in having one will, the legislative, when once established by the
majority, has the declaring, and as it were keeping of that will. the
constitution of the legislative is the first and fundamental act of
society, whereby provision is made for the continuation of their union,
under the direction of persons [[person]], and bonds of laws [[law]], made by persons
authorized thereunto, by the [[consent]] and appointment of the [[people]],
without which no one [[man]], or number of [[men]], amongst them, can have
authority of making laws [[law]] that shall be binding to the rest. when any
one, or more, shall take upon them to make laws [[law]], whom the [[people]] have
not appointed so to do, they make laws [[law]] without [[authority]], which the
people are not therefore bound to obey; by which means they come again
to be out of subjection, and may constitute to themselves a new
legislative, as they [[think]] [[best]], being in full [[liberty]] to resist the
force of those, who without [[authority]] would impose any thing upon them.
every one is at the disposure of his own will, when those who had, by
the delegation of the [[society]], the declaring of the [[public]] will, are
excluded from it, and others usurp the place, who have no such authority
or delegation.

sect. 213. this being usually brought about by such in the commonwealth
who misuse the [[power]] they have; it is hard to consider it aright, and
know at whose door to lay it, without knowing the form of [[government]] in
which it happens. let us suppose then the legislative placed in the
concurrence of three distinct persons [[person]].

(<i>1</i>). a [[single]] hereditary [[person]], having the constant, supreme,
executive [[power]], and with it the [[power]] of convoking and dissolving the
other two within [[certain]] periods of [[time]].

(<i>2</i>). an assembly of hereditary nobility.

(<i>3</i>). an assembly of representatives chosen, pro tempore, by the
people. such a form of [[government]] supposed, it is evident,

sect. 214. first, that when such a [[single]] [[person]], or [[prince]], sets up his
own arbitrary will in place of the laws [[law]], which are the will of the
society, declared by the legislative, then the legislative is changed:
for that being in effect the legislative, whose rules [[rule]] and laws [[law]] are put
in execution, and required to be obeyed; when other laws [[law]] are set up, and
other rules [[rule]] pretended, and inforced, than what the legislative,
constituted by the [[society]], have enacted, it is plain that the
legislative is changed. whoever introduces new laws [[law]], not being thereunto
authorized by the fundamental appointment of the [[society]], or subverts
the old, disowns and overturns the [[power]] by which they were made, and so
sets up a new legislative.

sect. 215. secondly, when the [[prince]] hinders the legislative from
assembling in its due [[time]], or from acting freely, pursuant to those
ends for which it was constituted, the legislative is altered: for it is
not a [[certain]] number of [[men]], no, nor their meeting, unless they have
also [[freedom]] of debating, and leisure of perfecting, what is for the
good of the [[society]], wherein the legislative consists: when these are
taken away or altered, so as to deprive the [[society]] of the due exercise
of their [[power]], the legislative is truly altered; for it is not names
that constitute governments [[government]], but the use and exercise of those powers
that were intended to accompany them; so that he, who takes away the
freedom, or hinders the acting of the legislative in its due seasons, in
effect takes away the legislative, and puts an end to the [[government]].

sect. 216. thirdly, when, by the arbitrary [[power]] of the [[prince]], the
electors, or ways of election, are altered, without the [[consent]], and
contrary to the [[common]] interest of the [[people]], there also the
legislative is altered: for, if others than those whom the [[society]] hath
authorized thereunto, do chuse, or in another way than what the society
hath prescribed, those chosen are not the legislative appointed by the
people.

sect. 217. fourthly, the delivery also of the [[people]] into the subjection
of a [[foreign]] [[power]], either by the [[prince]], or by the legislative, is
certainly a [[change]] of the legislative, and so a dissolution of the
government: for the end why [[people]] entered into [[society]] being to be
preserved one intire, [[free]], independent [[society]], to be governed by its
own laws [[law]]; this is lost, whenever they are given up into the [[power]] of
another.

sect. 218. why, in such a [[constitution]] as this, the dissolution of the
government in these cases is to be imputed to the [[prince]], is evident;
because he, having the [[force]], treasure and offices of the [[state]] to
employ, and often persuading himself, or being flattered by others, that
as supreme magistrate he is uncapable of controul; he alone is in a
condition to make [[great]] advances toward such changes [[change]], under pretence of
lawful [[authority]], and has it in his hands to terrify or suppress
opposers, as factious, seditious, and enemies [[enemy]] to the [[government]]: whereas
no other part of the legislative, or [[people]], is capable by themselves to
attempt any alteration of the legislative, without open and visible
rebellion, apt enough to be taken notice of, which, when it prevails,
produces effects very little different from [[foreign]] [[conquest]]. besides,
the [[prince]] in such a form of [[government]], having the [[power]] of dissolving
the other parts of the legislative, and thereby rendering them private
persons, they can never in opposition to him, or without his
concurrence, alter the legislative by a [[law]], his [[consent]] being necessary
to give any of their decrees that sanction. but yet, so far as the other
parts of the legislative any way contribute to any attempt upon the
government, and do either promote, or not, what lies [[lie]] in them, hinder
such designs, they are guilty, and partake in this, which is certainly
the [[greatest]] crime which [[men]] can partake of one towards another.

sec. 219.there is one way more whereby such a [[government]] may be
dissolved, and that is: when he who has the supreme executive [[power]],
neglects and abandons that charge, so that the laws [[law]] already made can no
longer be put in execution. this is demonstratively to reduce all to
anarchy, and so effectually to dissolve the [[government]]: for laws [[law]] not
being made for themselves, but to be, by their execution, the bonds of
the [[society]], to keep every part of the [[body]] [[politic]] in its due place and
function; when that totally ceases, the [[government]] visibly ceases, and
the [[people]] become a confused multitude, without order or connexion.
where there is no longer the administration of [[justice]], for the securing
of men's rights [[right]], nor any remaining [[power]] within the [[community]] to direct
the [[force]], or provide for the necessities of the [[public]], there certainly
is no [[government]] left. where the laws [[law]] cannot be executed, it is all one
as if there were no laws [[law]]; and a [[government]] without laws [[law]] is, i suppose, a
mystery in [[politics]], unconceivable to [[human]] capacity, and inconsistent
with [[human]] [[society]].

sect. 220. in these and the like cases, when the [[government]] is
dissolved, the [[people]] are at [[liberty]] to provide for themselves, by
erecting a new legislative, differing from the other, by the [[change]] of
persons, or form, or both, as they shall find it most for their safety
and [[good]]: for the [[society]] can never, by the [[fault]] of another, lose the
native and original [[right]] it has to preserve itself, which can only be
done by a settled legislative, and a [[fair]] and [[impartial]] execution of the
laws made by it. but the [[state]] of [[mankind]] is not so miserable that they
are not capable of using this remedy, till it be too late to look for
any. to tell [[people]] they may provide for themselves, by erecting a new
legislative, when by oppression, artifice, or being delivered over to a
foreign [[power]], their old one is gone, is only to tell them, they may
expect relief when it is too late, and the [[evil]] is [[past]] cure. this is in
effect no more than to bid them first be slaves [[slave]], and then to take care
of their [[liberty]]; and when their chains are on, tell them, they may act
like freemen. this, if barely so, is rather mockery than relief; and men
can never be secure from [[tyranny]], if there be no means to escape it till
they are perfectly under it: and therefore it is, that they have not
only a [[right]] to get out of it, but to prevent it.

sect. 221. there is therefore, secondly, another way whereby governments
are dissolved, and that is, when the legislative, or the [[prince]], either
of them, act contrary to their trust.

first, the legislative acts against the trust reposed in them, when they
endeavour to invade the [[property]] of the [[subject]], and to make themselves,
or any part of the [[community]], masters, or arbitrary disposers of the
lives, liberties [[liberty]], or fortunes [[fortune]] of the [[people]].

sect. 222. the [[reason]] why [[men]] enter into [[society]], is the preservation of
their [[property]]; and the end why they chuse and authorize a legislative,
is, that there may be laws [[law]] made, and rules [[rule]] set, as guards and fences to
the properties [[property]] of all the members of the [[society]], to limit the [[power]],
and moderate the dominion, of every part and member of the [[society]]: for
since it can never be supposed to be the will of the [[society]], that the
legislative should have a [[power]] to [[destroy]] that which every one designs
to secure, by entering into [[society]], and for which the [[people]] submitted
themselves to legislators of their own making; whenever the legislators
endeavour to take away, and [[destroy]] the [[property]] of the [[people]], or to
reduce them to [[slavery]] under arbitrary [[power]], they put themselves into a
state of [[war]] with the [[people]], who are thereupon absolved from any
farther [[obedience]], and are left to the [[common]] refuge, which [[god]] hath
provided for all [[men]], against [[force]] and [[violence]]. whensoever therefore
the legislative shall transgress this fundamental [[rule]] of [[society]]; and
either by [[ambition]], [[fear]], folly or [[corruption]], endeavour to grasp
themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute [[power]] over
the lives [[life]], liberties [[liberty]], and estates of the [[people]]; by this breach of trust
they forfeit the [[power]] the [[people]] had put into their hands for quite
contrary ends, and it devolves to the [[people]], who have a [[right]] to resume
their original [[liberty]], and, by the establishment of a new legislative,
(such as they shall [[think]] fit) provide for their own safety and
security, which is the end for which they are in [[society]]. what i have
said here, concerning the legislative in general, holds true also
concerning the supreme executor, who having a double trust put in him,
both to have a part in the legislative, and the supreme execution of the
law, acts against both, when he goes about to set up his own arbitrary
will as the [[law]] of the [[society]]. he acts also contrary to his trust, when
he either employs the [[force]], treasure, and offices of the [[society]], to
corrupt the representatives, and gain them to his purposes [[purpose]]; or openly
preengages the electors, and prescribes to their [[choice]], such, whom he
has, by sollicitations, threats, promises, or otherwise, won to his
designs; and employs them to bring in such, who have promised
before-hand what to vote, and what to enact. thus to regulate candidates
and electors, and new-model the ways of election, what is it but to cut
up the [[government]] by the roots, and poison the very fountain of public
security? for the [[people]] having reserved to themselves the [[choice]] of
their representatives, as the fence to their properties [[property]], could do it for
no other end, but that they might always be freely chosen, and so
chosen, freely act, and advise, as the necessity of the commonwealth,
and the [[public]] [[good]] should, upon examination, and mature debate, be
judged to require. this, those who give their votes before they hear the
debate, and have weighed the reasons [[reason]] on all sides, are not capable of
doing. to prepare such an assembly as this, and endeavour to set up the
declared abettors of his own will, for the true representatives of the
people, and the law-makers of the [[society]], is certainly as [[great]] a
breach of trust, and as [[perfect]] a declaration of a design to subvert the
government, as is possible to be met with. to which, if one shall add
rewards and punishments [[punishment]] visibly employed to the same end, and all the
arts of perverted [[law]] made use of, to take off and [[destroy]] all that
stand in the way of such a design, and will not comply and [[consent]] to
betray the liberties [[liberty]] of their [[country]], it will be [[past]] [[doubt]] what is
doing. what [[power]] they ought to have in the [[society]], who thus employ it
contrary to the trust went along with it in its first institution, is
easy to determine; and one cannot but see, that he, who has once
attempted any such thing as this, cannot any longer be trusted.

sect. 223. to this perhaps it will be said, that the [[people]] being
ignorant, and always discontented, to lay the foundation of government
in the unsteady [[opinion]] and uncertain [[humour]] of the [[people]], is to expose
it to [[certain]] ruin; and no [[government]] will be able long to subsist, if
the [[people]] may set up a new legislative, whenever they take offence at
the old one. to this i [[answer]], quite the contrary. [[people]] are not so
easily got out of their old forms, as some are apt to suggest. they are
hardly to be prevailed with to amend the acknowledged faults [[fault]] in the
frame they have been accustomed to. and if there be any original
defects, or adventitious ones introduced by [[time]], or [[corruption]]; it is
not an easy thing to get them changed, even when all the [[world]] sees
there is an opportunity for it. this slowness and aversion in the people
to quit their old constitutions [[constitution]], has, in the many revolutions [[revolution]] which have
been seen in this [[kingdom]], in this and former ages [[age]], still kept us to,
or, after some interval of fruitless attempts, still brought us back
again to our old legislative of [[king]], lords [[lord]] and commons [[common]]: and whatever
provocations have made the [[crown]] be taken from some of our princes
heads, they never carried the [[people]] so far as to place it in another
line.

sect. 224. but it will be said, this hypothesis lays a ferment for
frequent rebellion. to which i [[answer]],

first, no more than any other hypothesis: for when the [[people]] are made
miserable, and find themselves exposed to the ill usage of arbitrary
power, cry up their governors, as much as you will, for sons [[son]] of [[jupiter]];
let them be [[sacred]] and [[divine]], descended, or authorized from [[heaven]];
give them out for whom or what you please, the same will happen. the
people generally ill treated, and contrary to [[right]], will be ready upon
any [[occasion]] to ease themselves of a burden that sits heavy upon them.
they will [[wish]], and seek for the opportunity, which in the [[change]],
weakness and accidents of [[human]] affairs, seldom delays long to offer
itself. he must have lived but a little while in the [[world]], who has not
seen examples [[example]] of this in his [[time]]; and he must have [[read]] very little,
who cannot [[produce]] examples [[example]] of it in all sorts of governments [[government]] in the
world.

sect. 225. secondly, i [[answer]], such revolutions [[revolution]] happen not upon every
little mismanagement in [[public]] affairs. [[great]] mistakes in the ruling
part, many [[wrong]] and inconvenient laws [[law]], and all the slips of human
frailty, will be born by the [[people]] without mutiny or murmur. but if a
long train of abuses [[abuse]], prevarications and artifices, all tending the same
way, make the design visible to the [[people]], and they cannot but feel
what they [[lie]] under, and see whither they are going; it is not to be
wondered, that they should then rouze themselves, and endeavour to put
the [[rule]] into such hands which may secure to them the ends for which
government was at first erected; and without which, ancient names, and
specious forms, are so far from being [[better]], that they are much worse,
than the [[state]] of [[nature]], or pure [[anarchy]]; the inconveniencies being all
as [[great]] and as near, but the remedy farther off and more difficult.

sect. 226. thirdly, i [[answer]], that this doctrine of a [[power]] in the
people of providing for their safety a-new, by a new legislative, when
their legislators have acted contrary to their trust, by invading their
property, is the [[best]] fence against rebellion, and the probablest means
to hinder it: for rebellion being an opposition, not to persons [[person]], but
authority, which is founded only in the constitutions [[constitution]] and laws [[law]] of the
government; those, whoever they be, who by [[force]] break through, and by
force justify their violation of them, are truly and properly rebels:
for when [[men]], by entering into [[society]] and civil-government, have
excluded [[force]], and introduced laws [[law]] for the preservation of [[property]],
peace, and unity amongst themselves, those who set up [[force]] again in
opposition to the laws [[law]], do rebellare, that is, bring back again the
state of [[war]], and are properly rebels: which they who are in [[power]], (by
the pretence they have to [[authority]], the temptation of [[force]] they have
in their hands, and the [[flattery]] of those about them) being likeliest to
do; the properest way to prevent the [[evil]], is to shew them the danger
and [[injustice]] of it, who are under the [[greatest]] temptation to run into
it.

sect. 227. in both the fore-mentioned cases, when either the legislative
is changed, or the legislators act contrary to the end for which they
were constituted; those who are guilty are guilty of rebellion: for if
any one by [[force]] takes away the established legislative of any [[society]],
and the laws [[law]] by them made, pursuant to their trust, he thereby takes
away the umpirage, which every one had consented to, for a peaceable
decision of all their controversies, and a bar to the [[state]] of war
amongst them. they, who remove, or [[change]] the legislative, take away
this decisive [[power]], which no [[body]] can have, but by the appointment and
consent of the [[people]]; and so destroying the [[authority]] which the people
did, and no [[body]] else can set up, and introducing a [[power]] which the
people hath not authorized, they actually introduce a [[state]] of [[war]],
which is that of [[force]] without [[authority]]: and thus, by removing the
legislative established by the [[society]], (in whose decisions the people
acquiesced and [[united]], as to that of their own will) they untie the
knot, and expose the [[people]] a-new to the [[state]] of [[war]], and if those, who
by [[force]] take away the legislative, are rebels, the legislators
themselves, as has been shewn, can be no less esteemed so; when they,
who were set up for the protection, and preservation of the [[people]],
their liberties [[liberty]] and properties [[property]], shall by [[force]] invade and endeavour to
take them away; and so they putting themselves into a [[state]] of [[war]] with
those who made them the protectors and guardians of their [[peace]], are
properly, and with the [[greatest]] aggravation, rebellantes, rebels.

sect. 228. but if they, who say it lays a foundation for rebellion, mean
that it may [[occasion]] civil wars [[war]], or intestine broils, to tell the people
they are absolved from [[obedience]] when illegal attempts are made upon
their liberties [[liberty]] or properties [[property]], and may oppose the unlawful [[violence]] of
those who were their magistrates, when they invade their properties
contrary to the trust put in them; and that therefore this doctrine is
not to be allowed, being so destructive to the [[peace]] of the [[world]]: they
may as well say, upon the same ground, that honest [[men]] may not oppose
robbers or pirates, because this may [[occasion]] disorder or bloodshed. if
any mischief come in such cases, it is not to be charged upon him who
defends his own [[right]], but on him that invades his neighbours. if the
innocent honest [[man]] must quietly quit all he has, for [[peace]] sake, to him
who will lay [[violent]] hands upon it, i [[desire]] it may be considered, what
a [[kind]] of [[peace]] there will be in the [[world]], which consists only in
violence and rapine; and which is to be maintained only for the benefit
of robbers and oppressors. who would not [[think]] it an admirable peace
betwix the mighty and the mean, when the lamb, without [[resistance]],
yielded his throat to be torn by the imperious wolf? polyphemus's den
gives us a [[perfect]] pattern of such a [[peace]], and such a [[government]],
wherein [[ulysses]] and his companions had nothing to do, but quietly to
suffer themselves to be devoured. and no [[doubt]] [[ulysses]], who was a
prudent [[man]], preached up passive [[obedience]], and exhorted them to a quiet
submission, by representing to them of what concernment [[peace]] was to
mankind; and by shewing the inconveniences might happen, if they should
offer to resist polyphemus, who had now the [[power]] over them.

sect. 229. the end of [[government]] is the [[good]] of [[mankind]]; and which is
best for [[mankind]], that the [[people]] should be always exposed to the
boundless will of [[tyranny]], or that the rulers should be sometimes liable
to be opposed, when they grow exorbitant in the use of their [[power]], and
employ it for the destruction, and not the preservation of the
properties of their [[people]]?

sect. 230. nor let any one say, that mischief can arise from hence, as
often as it shall please a busy head, or turbulent spirit, to [[desire]] the
alteration of the [[government]]. it is true, such [[men]] may stir, whenever
they please; but it will be only to their own just ruin and perdition:
for till the mischief be grown general, and the ill designs of the
rulers become visible, or their attempts sensible to the greater part,
the [[people]], who are more disposed to suffer than [[right]] themselves by
resistance, are not apt to stir. the examples [[example]] of particular [[injustice]],
or oppression of here and there an unfortunate [[man]], moves them not. but
if they universally have a persuation, grounded upon manifest evidence,
that designs are carrying on against their liberties [[liberty]], and the general
course and tendency of things cannot but give them [[strong]] suspicions of
the [[evil]] intention of their governors, who is to be blamed for it? who
can [[help]] it, if they, who might avoid it, bring themselves into this
suspicion? are the [[people]] to be blamed, if they have the sense of
rational creatures, and can [[think]] of things no otherwise than as they
find and [[feel]] them? and is it not rather their [[fault]], who put things
into such a posture, that they would not have them [[thought]] to be as they
are? i grant, that the [[pride]], [[ambition]], and turbulency of private men
have sometimes caused [[great]] disorders in commonwealths, and factions
have been fatal to states and kingdoms [[kingdom]]. but whether the mischief hath
oftener begun in the peoples [[people]] wantonness, and a [[desire]] to cast off the
lawful [[authority]] of their rulers, or in the rulers insolence, and
endeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary [[power]] over their [[people]];
whether oppression, or disobedience, gave the first rise to the
disorder, i leave it to [[impartial]] [[history]] to determine. this i am sure,
whoever, either ruler or [[subject]], by [[force]] goes about to invade the
rights of either [[prince]] or [[people]], and lays the foundation for
overturning the [[constitution]] and frame of any just [[government]], is highly
guilty of the [[greatest]] crime, i [[think]], a [[man]] is capable of, being to
answer for all those mischiefs of [[blood]], rapine, and desolation, which
the breaking to pieces of governments [[government]] bring on a [[country]]. and he who
does it, is justly to be esteemed the [[common]] [[enemy]] and pest of [[mankind]],
and is to be treated accordingly.

sect. 231. that subjects [[subject]] or foreigners, attempting by [[force]] on the
properties of any [[people]], may be resisted with [[force]], is agreed on all
hands. but that magistrates, doing the same thing, may be resisted, hath
of late been denied: as if those who had the [[greatest]] privileges [[privilege]] and
advantages by the [[law]], had thereby a [[power]] to break those laws [[law]], by which
alone they were set in a [[better]] place than their brethren [[brother]]: whereas their
offence is thereby the greater, both as being ungrateful for the greater
share they have by the [[law]], and breaking also that trust, which is put
into their hands by their brethren [[brother]].

sect. 232. whosoever uses [[force]] without [[right]], as every one does in
society, who does it without [[law]], puts himself into a [[state]] of [[war]] with
those against whom he so uses it; and in that [[state]] all former ties are
cancelled, all other rights [[right]] cease, and every one has a [[right]] to defend
himself, and to resist the aggressor. this is so evident, that barclay
himself, that [[great]] assertor of the [[power]] and sacredness of kings [[king]], is
forced to confess, that it is lawful for the [[people]], in some cases, to
resist their [[king]]; and that too in a [[chapter]], wherein he pretends to
shew, that the [[divine]] [[law]] shuts up the [[people]] from all manner of
rebellion. whereby it is evident, even by his own doctrine, that, since
they may in some cases resist, all resisting of princes [[prince]] is not
rebellion. his words are these. quod siquis dicat, ergone populus
tyrannicae crudelitati & furori jugulum semper praebebit? ergone
multitude civitates suas fame, ferro, & flamma vastari, seque, conjuges,
& liberos fortunae ludibrio & tyranni libidini exponi, inque omnia vitae
pericula omnesque miserias & molestias a rege deduci patientur? num
illis quod omni animantium generi est a natura tributum, denegari debet,
ut sc. vim vi repellant, seseq; ab injuria, tueantur? huic breviter
responsum sit, populo universo negari defensionem, quae juris naturalis
est, neque ultionem quae praeter naturam est adversus regem concedi
debere. quapropter si rex non in singulares tantum personas aliquot
privatum odium exerceat, sed corpus etiam reipublicae, cujus ipse caput
est, i.e. totum populum, vel insignem aliquam ejus partem immani &
intoleranda saevitia seu tyrannide divexet; populo, quidem hoc casu
resistendi ac tuendi se ab injuria potestas competit, sed tuendi se
tantum, non enim in principem invadendi: & restituendae injuriae
illatae, non recedendi a debita reverentia propter acceptam injuriam.
praesentem denique impetum propulsandi non vim praeteritam ulciscenti
jus habet. horum enim alterum a natura est, ut vitam scilicet corpusque
tueamur. alterum vero contra naturam, ut inferior de superiori
supplicium sumat. quod itaque populus malum, antequam factum sit,
impedire potest, ne fiat, id postquam factum est, in regem authorem
sceleris vindicare non potest: populus igitur hoc amplius quam privatus
quispiam habet: quod huic, vel ipsis adversariis judicibus, excepto
buchanano, nullum nisi in patientia remedium superest. cum ille si
intolerabilis tyrannus est (modicum enim ferre omnino debet) resistere
cum reverentia possit, barclay contra monarchom. 1. iii. c. 8.

in english thus:

sect. 233. but if any one should ask, must the [[people]] then always lay
themselves open to the [[cruelty]] and rage of [[tyranny]]? must they see their
cities pillaged, and laid in ashes, their wives [[wife]] and [[children]] exposed to
the tyrant's [[lust]] and fury, and themselves and families [[family]] reduced by their
king to ruin, and all the miseries of want and oppression, and yet sit
still? must [[men]] alone be debarred the [[common]] [[privilege]] of opposing force
with [[force]], which [[nature]] allows so freely to all other creatures for
their preservation from injury? i [[answer]]: self-defence is a part of the
law of [[nature]]; nor can it be denied the [[community]], even against the king
himself: but to [[revenge]] themselves upon him, must by no means be allowed
them; it being not agreeable to that [[law]]. wherefore if the [[king]] shall
shew an [[hatred]], not only to some particular persons [[person]], but sets himself
against the [[body]] of the commonwealth, whereof he is the head, and
shall, with intolerable ill usage, cruelly tyrannize over the whole, or
a considerable part of the [[people]], in this case the [[people]] have a right
to resist and defend themselves from injury: but it must be with this
caution, that they only defend themselves, but do not attack their
prince: they may repair the damages received, but must not for any
provocation exceed the bounds of due reverence and [[respect]]. they may
repulse the [[present]] attempt, but must not [[revenge]] [[past]] violences: for it
is [[natural]] for us to defend [[life]] and limb, but that an inferior should
punish a superior, is against [[nature]]. the mischief which is designed
them, the [[people]] may prevent before it be done; but when it is done,
they must not [[revenge]] it on the [[king]], though author of the villany. this
therefore is the [[privilege]] of the [[people]] in general, above what any
private [[person]] hath; that particular [[men]] are allowed by our adversaries
themselves (buchanan only excepted) to have no other remedy but
patience; but the [[body]] of the [[people]] may with [[respect]] resist intolerable
tyranny; for when it is but moderate, they ought to endure it.

sect. 234. thus far that [[great]] advocate of monarchical [[power]] allows of
resistance.

sect. 235. it is true, he has annexed two limitations to it, to no
purpose:

first, he says, it must be with reverence.

secondly, it must be without retribution, or [[punishment]]; and the reason
he gives is, because an inferior cannot punish a superior. first, how to
resist [[force]] without striking again, or how to strike with reverence,
will need some [[skill]] to make intelligible. he that shall oppose an
assault only with a shield to receive the blows, or in any more
respectful posture, without a [[sword]] in his hand, to abate the confidence
and [[force]] of the assailant, will quickly be at an end of his [[resistance]],
and will find such a defence serve only to draw on himself the worse
usage. this is as ridiculous a way of resisting, as juvenal [[thought]] it
of fighting; ubi tu pulsas, ego vapulo tantum. and the [[success]] of the
combat will be unavoidably the same he there describes it:

/*[4]
      -----libertas pauperis haec est:
    pulsatus rogat, et pugnis concisus, adorat,
    ut liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti.
*/

this will always be the event of such an imaginary [[resistance]], where men
may not strike again. he therefore who may resist, must be allowed to
strike. and then let our author, or any [[body]] else, join a knock on the
head, or a cut on the face, with as much reverence and [[respect]] as he
thinks fit. he that can reconcile blows and reverence, may, for aught i
know, [[desire]] for his pains [[pain]], a civil, respectful cudgeling where-ever he
can meet with it.

secondly, as to his second, an inferior cannot punish a superior; that
is true, generally speaking, whilst he is his superior. but to resist
force with [[force]], being the [[state]] of [[war]] that levels the parties,
cancels all former relation of reverence, [[respect]], and superiority: and
then the odds that remains, is, that he, who opposes the unjust
agressor, has this superiority over him, that he has a [[right]], when he
prevails, to punish the offender, both for the breach of the [[peace]], and
all the evils [[evil]] that followed upon it. barclay therefore, in another
place, more coherently to himself, denies it to be lawful to resist a
king in any case. but he there assigns two cases, whereby a [[king]] may
un-king himself. his words are,

quid ergo, nulline casus incidere possunt quibus populo sese erigere
atque in regem impotentius dominantem arma capere & invadere jure suo
suaque authoritate liceat? nulli certe quamdiu rex manet. semper enim ex
divinis id obstat, regem honorificato; & qui potestati resistit, dei
ordinationi resisit: non alias igitur in eum populo potestas est quam si
id committat propter quod ipso jure rex esse desinat. tunc enim se ipse
principatu exuit atque in privatis constituit liber: hoc modo populus &
superior efficitur, reverso ad eum sc. jure illo quod ante regem
inauguratum in interregno habuit. at sunt paucorum generum commissa
ejusmodi quae hunc effectum pariunt. at ego cum plurima animo
perlustrem, duo tantum invenio, duos, inquam, casus quibus rex ipso
facto ex rege non regem se facit & omni honore & dignitate regali atque
in subditos potestate destituit; quorum etiam meminit winzerus. horum
unus est, si regnum disperdat, quemadmodum de nerone fertur, quod is
nempe senatum populumque romanum, atque adeo urbem ipsam ferro flammaque
vastare, ac novas sibi sedes quaerere decrevisset. et de caligula, quod
palam denunciarit se neque civem neque principem senatui amplius fore,
inque animo habuerit interempto utriusque ordinis electissimo quoque
alexandriam commigrare, ac ut populum uno ictu interimeret, unam ei
cervicem optavit. talia cum rex aliquis meditator & molitur serio, omnem
regnandi curam & animum ilico abjicit, ac proinde imperium in subditos
amittit, ut dominus servi pro derelicto habiti dominium.

sect. 236. alter casus est, si rex in alicujus clientelam se contulit,
ac regnum quod liberum a majoribus & populo traditum accepit, alienae
ditioni mancipavit. nam tunc quamvis forte non ea mente id agit populo
plane ut incommodet: tamen quia quod praecipuum est regiae dignitatis
amifit, ut summus scilicet in regno secundum deum sit, & solo deo
inferior, atque populum etiam totum ignorantem vel invitum, cujus
libertatem sartam & tectam conservare debuit, in alterius gentis
ditionem & potestatem dedidit; hac velut quadam regni ab alienatione
effecit, ut nec quod ipse in regno imperium habuit retineat, nec in eum
cui collatum voluit, juris quicquam transferat; atque ita eo facto
liberum jam & suae potestatis populum relinquit, cujus rei exemplum unum
annales scotici suppeditant. barclay contra monarchom. 1. iii. c. 16.

which in english runs thus:

sect. 237. what then, can there no case happen wherein the [[people]] may of
right, and by their own [[authority]], [[help]] themselves, take arms, and set
upon their [[king]], imperiously domineering over them? none at all, whilst
he remains a [[king]]. [[honour]] the [[king]], and he that resists the [[power]],
resists the ordinance of [[god]]; are [[divine]] oracles that will never permit
it, the [[people]] therefore can never come by a [[power]] over him, unless he
does something that makes him cease to be a [[king]]: for then he divests
himself of his [[crown]] and [[dignity]], and returns to the [[state]] of a private
man, and the [[people]] become [[free]] and superior, the [[power]] which they had
in the interregnum, before they crowned him [[king]], devolving to them
again. but there are but few miscarriages which bring the matter to this
state. after considering it well on all sides, i can find but two. two
cases there are, i say, whereby a [[king]], ipso facto, becomes no [[king]], and
loses all [[power]] and regal [[authority]] over his [[people]]; which are also
taken notice of by winzerus.

the first is, if he endeavour to overturn the [[government]], that is, if he
have a [[purpose]] and design to ruin the [[kingdom]] and commonwealth, as it is
recorded of nero, that he resolved to cut off the senate and [[people]] of
rome, lay the [[city]] waste with [[fire]] and [[sword]], and then remove to some
other place. and of caligula, that he openly declared, that he would be
no longer a head to the [[people]] or senate, and that he had it in his
thoughts to cut off the worthiest [[men]] of both ranks, and then retire to
alexandria: and he wisht that the [[people]] had but one neck, that he might
dispatch them all at a blow, such designs as these, when any king
harbours in his thoughts [[thought]], and seriously promotes, he immediately gives
up all [[care]] and [[thought]] of the commonwealth; and consequently forfeits
the [[power]] of governing his subjects [[subject]], as a master does the dominion over
his slaves [[slave]] whom he hath abandoned.

sect. 238. the other case is, when a [[king]] makes himself the dependent of
another, and subjects [[subject]] his [[kingdom]] which his [[ancestors]] left him, and the
people put [[free]] into his hands, to the dominion of another: for however
perhaps it may not be his intention to prejudice the [[people]]; yet because
he has hereby lost the principal part of regal [[dignity]], viz. to be next
and immediately under [[god]], supreme in his [[kingdom]]; and also because he
betrayed or forced his [[people]], whose [[liberty]] he ought to have carefully
preserved, into the [[power]] and dominion of a [[foreign]] nation. by this, as
it were, alienation of his [[kingdom]], he himself loses the [[power]] he had in
it before, without transferring any the least [[right]] to those on whom he
would have bestowed it; and so by this act sets the [[people]] [[free]], and
leaves them at their own disposal. one [[example]] of this is to be found in
the scotch annals.

sect. 239. in these cases barclay, the [[great]] champion of absolute
monarchy, is forced to allow, that a [[king]] may be resisted, and ceases to
be a [[king]]. that is, in short, not to multiply cases, in whatsoever he
has no [[authority]], there he is no [[king]], and may be resisted: for
wheresoever the [[authority]] ceases, the [[king]] ceases too, and becomes like
other [[men]] who have no [[authority]]. and these two cases he instances in,
differ little from those above mentioned, to be destructive to
governments, only that he has omitted the [[principle]] from which his
doctrine flows: and that is, the breach of trust, in not preserving the
form of [[government]] agreed on, and in not intending the end of government
itself, which is the [[public]] [[good]] and preservation of [[property]]. when a
king has dethroned himself, and put himself in a [[state]] of [[war]] with his
people, what shall hinder them from prosecuting him who is no [[king]], as
they would any other [[man]], who has put himself into a [[state]] of [[war]] with
them, barclay, and those of his [[opinion]], would do well to tell us. this
farther i [[desire]] may be taken notice of out of barclay, that he says,
the mischief that is designed them, the [[people]] may prevent before it be
done: whereby he allows [[resistance]] when [[tyranny]] is but in design. such
designs as these (says he) when any [[king]] harbours in his thoughts [[thought]] and
seriously promotes, he immediately gives up all [[care]] and [[thought]] of the
commonwealth; so that, according to him, the neglect of the [[public]] good
is to be taken as an evidence of such design, or at least for a
sufficient cause of [[resistance]]. and the [[reason]] of all, he gives in these
words, because he betrayed or forced his [[people]], whose [[liberty]] he ought
carefully to have preserved. what he adds, into the [[power]] and dominion
of a [[foreign]] nation, signifies nothing, the [[fault]] and forfeiture lying
in the loss of their [[liberty]], which he ought to have preserved, and not
in any distinction of the persons [[person]] to whose dominion they were subjected.
the peoples [[people]] [[right]] is equally invaded, and their [[liberty]] lost, whether
they are made slaves [[slave]] to any of their own, or a [[foreign]] nation; and in
this lies [[lie]] the injury, and against this only have they the [[right]] of
defence. and there are instances to be found in all countries [[country]], which
shew, that it is not the [[change]] of nations in the persons [[person]] of their
governors, but the [[change]] of [[government]], that gives the offence. bilson,
a bishop of our [[church]], and a [[great]] stickler for the [[power]] and
prerogative of princes [[prince]], does, if i mistake not, in his treatise of
christian subjection, acknowledge, that princes [[prince]] may forfeit their [[power]],
and their title to the [[obedience]] of their subjects [[subject]]; and if there needed
authority in a case where [[reason]] is so plain, i could send my reader to
bracton, fortescue, and the author of the mirrour, and others, writers
that cannot be suspected to be ignorant of our [[government]], or enemies [[enemy]] to
it. but i [[thought]] hooker alone might be enough to satisfy those [[men]], who
relying on him for their ecclesiastical polity, are by a [[strange]] fate
carried to deny those principles [[principle]] upon which he builds it. whether they
are herein made the tools of cunninger workmen, to pull down their own
fabric, they were [[best]] look. this i am sure, their civil policy is so
new, so dangerous, and so destructive to both rulers and [[people]], that as
former ages [[age]] never could bear the broaching of it; so it may be hoped,
those to come, redeemed from the impositions of these egyptian
under-task-masters, will abhor the memory of such servile flatterers,
who, whilst it seemed to serve their turn, resolved all [[government]] into
absolute [[tyranny]], and would have all [[men]] born to, what their mean souls
fitted them for, [[slavery]].

sect. 240. here, it is like, the [[common]] [[question]] will be made, who shall
be [[judge]], whether the [[prince]] or legislative act contrary to their trust?
this, perhaps, ill-affected and factious [[men]] may spread amongst the
people, when the [[prince]] only makes use of his due prerogative. to this i
reply, the [[people]] shall be [[judge]]; for who shall be [[judge]] whether his
trustee or deputy acts well, and according to the trust reposed in him,
but he who deputes him, and must, by having deputed him, have still a
power to discard him, when he fails in his trust? if this be reasonable
in particular cases of private [[men]], why should it be otherwise in that
of the [[greatest]] moment, where the welfare of millions is concerned, and
also where the [[evil]], if not prevented, is greater, and the redress very
difficult, dear, and dangerous?

sect. 241. but farther, this [[question]], (who shall be [[judge]]?) cannot
mean, that there is no [[judge]] at all: for where there is no judicature on
earth, to decide controversies amongst [[men]], [[god]] in [[heaven]] is [[judge]]. he
alone, it is true, is [[judge]] of the [[right]]. but every [[man]] is [[judge]] for
himself, as in all other cases, so in this, whether another hath put
himself into a [[state]] of [[war]] with him, and whether he should appeal to
the supreme [[judge]], as jeptha did.

sect. 242. if a controversy arise betwixt a [[prince]] and some of the
people, in a matter where the [[law]] is silent, or doubtful, and the thing
be of [[great]] consequence, i should [[think]] the proper umpire, in such a
case, should be the [[body]] of the [[people]]: for in cases where the prince
hath a trust reposed in him, and is dispensed from the [[common]] ordinary
rules of the [[law]]; there, if any [[men]] find themselves aggrieved, and think
the [[prince]] acts contrary to, or beyond that trust, who so proper to
judge as the [[body]] of the [[people]], (who, at first, lodged that trust in
him) how far they meant it should extend? but if the [[prince]], or whoever
they be in the administration, decline that way of determination, the
appeal then lies [[lie]] no where but to [[heaven]]; [[force]] between either persons [[person]],
who have no known superior on [[earth]], or which permits no appeal to a
judge on [[earth]], being properly a [[state]] of [[war]], wherein the appeal lies
only to [[heaven]]; and in that [[state]] the injured party must [[judge]] for
himself, when he will [[think]] fit to make use of that appeal, and put
himself upon it.

sect. 243. to conclude, the [[power]] that every [[individual]] gave the
society, when he entered into it, can never revert to the individuals
again, as long as the [[society]] lasts, but will always remain in the
community; because without this there can be no [[community]], no
commonwealth, which is contrary to the original agreement: so also when
the [[society]] hath placed the legislative in any assembly of [[men]], to
continue in them and their successors, with direction and [[authority]] for
providing such successors, the legislative can never revert to the
people whilst that [[government]] lasts; because having provided a
legislative with [[power]] to continue for ever, they have given up their
political [[power]] to the legislative, and cannot resume it. but if they
have set limits to the duration of their legislative, and made this
supreme [[power]] in any [[person]], or assembly, only temporary; or else, when
by the miscarriages of those in [[authority]], it is forfeited; upon the
forfeiture, or at the determination of the [[time]] set, it reverts to the
society, and the [[people]] have a [[right]] to act as supreme, and continue the
legislative in themselves; or erect a new form, or under the old form
place it in new hands, as they [[think]] [[good]].


finis.
