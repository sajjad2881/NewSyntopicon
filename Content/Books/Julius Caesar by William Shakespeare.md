act i

scene i. [[rome]]. a street.

 enter flavius, marullus and a throng of [[citizens]].

flavius.
hence! [[home]], you idle creatures, get you [[home]].
is this a holiday? what, [[know]] you not,
being mechanical, you ought not walk
upon a labouring day without the sign
of your profession? speak, what [[trade]] art [[arts]] thou?

carpenter.
why, sir, a carpenter.

marullus.
where is thy leather apron and thy [[rule]]?
what dost thou with thy [[best]] apparel on?
you, sir, what [[trade]] are you?

cobbler.
truly, sir, in [[respect]] of a fine workman, i am but, as you would say, a
cobbler.

marullus.
but what [[trade]] art [[arts]] thou? [[answer]] me directly.

cobbler.
a [[trade]], sir, that i [[hope]] i may use with a safe [[conscience]], which is
indeed, sir, a mender of [[bad]] soles.

marullus.
what [[trade]], thou knave? thou naughty knave, what [[trade]]?

cobbler.
nay, i beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet, if you be out, sir, i
can mend you.

marullus.
what mean’st thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!

cobbler.
why, sir, cobble you.

flavius.
thou art [[arts]] a cobbler, art [[arts]] thou?

cobbler.
truly, sir, all that i [[live]] by is with the awl; i meddle with no
tradesman’s matters, nor women’s matters, but withal i am indeed, sir,
a surgeon to old shoes: when they are in [[great]] danger, i recover them.
as proper [[men]] as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my
handiwork.

flavius.
but wherefore art [[arts]] not in thy shop today?
why dost thou lead these [[men]] about the streets?

cobbler.
truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself into more [[work]]. but
indeed, sir, we make holiday to see caesar, and to rejoice in his
triumph.

marullus.
wherefore rejoice? what [[conquest]] brings he [[home]]?
what tributaries [[follow]] him to [[rome]],
to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?
you blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
o you hard hearts [[heart]], you cruel [[men]] of [[rome]],
knew you not pompey? many a [[time]] and oft
have you climb’d up to walls and battlements,
to towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
your infants in your arms, and there have sat
the livelong day with patient expectation,
to see [[great]] pompey pass the streets of [[rome]].
and when you saw his chariot but appear,
have you not made an universal shout,
that tiber trembled underneath her banks
to hear the replication of your sounds
made in her concave shores?
and do you now put on your [[best]] attire?
and do you now cull out a holiday?
and do you now strew flowers in his way,
that comes in triumph over pompey’s [[blood]]?
be gone!
run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
pray to the gods to intermit the plague
that needs must [[light]] on this ingratitude.

flavius.
go, go, [[good]] countrymen, and, for this fault
assemble all the [[poor]] [[men]] of your sort,
draw them to tiber banks, and weep your tears
into the channel, till the lowest stream
do kiss the most exalted shores of all.

 [_exeunt [[citizens]]._]

see whether their basest metal be not mov’d;
they vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
go you down that way towards the capitol;
this way will i. disrobe the images,
if you do find them deck’d with ceremonies [[ceremony]].

marullus.
may we do so?
you [[know]] it is the feast of lupercal.

flavius.
it is no matter; let no images
be hung with caesar’s trophies. i’ll about
and drive away the vulgar from the streets;
so do you too, where you perceive them thick.
these growing feathers pluck’d from caesar’s wing
will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
who else would soar above the view of [[men]],
and keep us all in servile fearfulness.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. the same. a [[public]] place.

 enter, in procession, with [[music]], caesar; antony, for the course;
 calphurnia, portia, decius, cicero, brutus, cassius and casca; a great
 crowd following, among them a soothsayer.

caesar.
calphurnia.

casca.
peace, ho! caesar speaks.

 [_music ceases._]

caesar.
calphurnia.

calphurnia.
here, my [[lord]].

caesar.
stand you directly in antonius’ way,
when he doth run his course. antonius.

antony.
caesar, my [[lord]]?

caesar.
forget not in your speed, antonius,
to touch calphurnia; for our elders say,
the barren, touched in this holy chase,
shake off their sterile curse.

antony.
i shall [[remember]].
when caesar says “do this,” it is perform’d.

caesar.
set on; and leave no [[ceremony]] out.

 [_music._]

soothsayer.
caesar!

caesar.
ha! who calls?

casca.
bid every noise be still; [[peace]] yet again!

 [_music ceases._]

caesar.
who is it in the press that calls on me?
i hear a tongue shriller than all the [[music]],
cry “caesar”! speak. caesar is turn’d to hear.

soothsayer.
beware the ides of march.

caesar.
what [[man]] is that?

brutus.
a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march.

caesar.
set him before me; let me see his face.

cassius.
fellow, come from the throng; look upon caesar.

caesar.
what say’st thou to me now? speak once again.

soothsayer.
beware the ides of march.

caesar.
he is a dreamer; let us leave him. pass.

 [_sennet. exeunt all but brutus and cassius._]

cassius.
will you go see the order of the course?

brutus.
not i.

cassius.
i [[pray]] you, do.

brutus.
i am not gamesome: i do lack some part
of that quick spirit that is in antony.
let me not hinder, cassius, your desires [[desire]];
i’ll leave you.

cassius.
brutus, i do observe you now of late:
i have not from your [[eyes]] that gentleness
and show of [[love]] as i was wont to have.
you bear too stubborn and too [[strange]] a hand
over your friend that loves [[love]] you.

brutus.
cassius,
be not deceived: if i have veil’d my look,
i turn the trouble of my countenance
merely upon myself. vexed i am
of late with [[passions]] of some difference,
conceptions only proper to myself,
which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
but let not therefore my [[good]] [[friends]] be grieved
(among which number, cassius, be you one)
nor construe any further my neglect,
than that [[poor]] brutus, with himself at [[war]],
forgets the shows of [[love]] to other [[men]].

cassius.
then, brutus, i have much mistook your passion;
by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
thoughts of [[great]] value, worthy cogitations.
tell me, [[good]] brutus, can you see your face?

brutus.
no, cassius, for the eye sees not itself
but by reflection, by some other thing.

cassius.
’tis just:
and it is very much lamented, brutus,
that you have no such mirrors as will turn
your hidden worthiness into your eye,
that you might see your shadow. i have heard
where many of the [[best]] [[respect]] in [[rome]],
(except [[immortal]] caesar) speaking of brutus,
and groaning underneath this age’s yoke,
have wish’d that [[noble]] brutus had his [[eyes]].

brutus.
into what dangers would you lead me, cassius,
that you would have me seek into myself
for that which is not in me?

cassius.
therefore, [[good]] brutus, be prepared to hear;
and since you [[know]] you cannot see yourself
so well as by reflection, i, your glass,
will modestly discover to yourself
that of yourself which you yet [[know]] not of.
and be not [[jealous]] on me, gentle brutus:
were i a [[common]] laugher, or did use
to stale with ordinary oaths my love
to every new protester; if you know
that i do fawn on [[men]], and hug them hard,
and after scandal them; or if you know
that i profess myself in banqueting,
to all the rout, then hold me dangerous.

 [_flourish and shout._]

brutus.
what means this shouting? i do [[fear]] the people
choose caesar for their [[king]].

cassius.
ay, do you [[fear]] it?
then must i [[think]] you would not have it so.

brutus.
i would not, cassius; yet i [[love]] him well,
but wherefore do you hold me here so long?
what is it that you would impart to me?
if it be aught toward the general [[good]],
set [[honour]] in one eye and [[death]] i’ the other,
and i will look on both indifferently;
for let the gods so speed me as i love
the name of [[honour]] more than i [[fear]] [[death]].

cassius.
i [[know]] that [[virtue]] to be in you, brutus,
as well as i do [[know]] your outward favour.
well, [[honour]] is the [[subject]] of my story.
i cannot tell what you and other men
think of this [[life]]; but, for my [[single]] [[self]],
i had as lief not be as [[live]] to be
in awe of such a thing as i myself.
i was born [[free]] as caesar; so were you;
we both have fed as well, and we can both
endure the winter’s cold as well as he:
for once, upon a raw and gusty day,
the troubled tiber chafing with her shores,
caesar said to me, “dar’st thou, cassius, now
leap in with me into this angry flood,
and swim to yonder point?” upon the word,
accoutred as i was, i plunged in,
and bade him [[follow]]: so indeed he did.
the torrent roar’d, and we did buffet it
with lusty sinews, throwing it aside
and stemming it with hearts [[heart]] of controversy.
but ere we could arrive the point propos’d,
caesar cried, “help me, cassius, or i sink!”
i, as [[aeneas]], our [[great]] ancestor,
did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder
the old anchises bear, so from the waves of tiber
did i the tired caesar. and this man
is now become a [[god]]; and cassius is
a wretched creature, and must bend his [[body]],
if caesar carelessly but nod on him.
he had a fever when he was in [[spain]],
and when the fit was on him i did mark
how he did shake: ’tis true, this [[god]] did shake:
his [[coward]] lips did from their colour fly,
and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
did lose his lustre. i did hear him groan:
ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the romans
mark him, and write his speeches [[speech]] in their books [[book]],
alas, it cried, “give me some drink, titinius,”
as a sick girl. ye gods, it doth amaze me,
a [[man]] of such a feeble temper should
so get the start of the majestic [[world]],
and bear the palm alone.

 [_shout. flourish._]

brutus.
another general shout?
i do [[believe]] that these applauses are
for some new honours [[honour]] that are heap’d on caesar.

cassius.
why, [[man]], he doth bestride the narrow world
like a colossus, and we petty men
walk under his huge legs, and peep about
to find ourselves dishonourable graves.
men at some [[time]] are masters of their fates [[fate]]:
the [[fault]], dear brutus, is not in our stars,
but in ourselves, that we are underlings.
“brutus” and “caesar”: what should be in that “caesar”?
why should that name be sounded more than yours?
write them together, yours is as [[fair]] a name;
sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,
“brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “caesar.”
now in the names of all the gods at once,
upon what meat doth this our caesar feed,
that he is grown so [[great]]? [[age]], thou art [[arts]] sham’d!
rome, thou hast lost the breed of [[noble]] bloods!
when went there by an [[age]] since the [[great]] flood,
but it was fam’d with more than with one [[man]]?
when could they say, till now, that talk’d of [[rome]],
that her wide walls encompass’d but one [[man]]?
now is it [[rome]] indeed, and room enough,
when there is in it but one only [[man]].
o, you and i have heard our fathers [[father]] say,
there was a brutus once that would have brook’d
th’ eternal [[devil]] to keep his [[state]] in [[rome]],
as easily as a king!

brutus.
that you do [[love]] me, i am nothing [[jealous]];
what you would [[work]] me to, i have some aim:
how i have [[thought]] of this, and of these times [[time]],
i shall recount hereafter. for this [[present]],
i would not, so with [[love]] i might entreat you,
be any further mov’d. what you have said,
i will consider; what you have to say
i will with patience hear; and find a time
both meet to hear and [[answer]] such high things.
till then, my [[noble]] friend, chew upon this:
brutus had rather be a villager
than to repute himself a [[son]] of rome
under these hard conditions as this time
is like to lay upon us.

cassius.
i am glad that my [[weak]] words
have struck but thus much show of [[fire]] from brutus.

 enter caesar and his train.

brutus.
the games are done, and caesar is returning.

cassius.
as they pass by, pluck casca by the sleeve,
and he will, after his sour [[fashion]], tell you
what hath proceeded worthy note today.

brutus.
i will do so. but, look you, cassius,
the angry spot doth glow on caesar’s brow,
and all the rest look like a chidden train:
calphurnia’s cheek is pale; and cicero
looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
as we have seen him in the capitol,
being cross’d in conference by some senators.

cassius.
casca will tell us what the matter is.

caesar.
antonius.

antony.
caesar?

caesar.
let me have [[men]] about me that are fat,
sleek-headed [[men]], and such as sleep a-nights:
yond cassius has a lean and hungry look;
he thinks [[think]] too much: such [[men]] are dangerous.

antony.
fear him not, caesar; he’s not dangerous;
he is a [[noble]] roman and well given.

caesar.
would he were fatter! but i [[fear]] him not:
yet if my name were liable to [[fear]],
i do not [[know]] the [[man]] i should avoid
so soon as that spare cassius. he reads much,
he is a [[great]] observer, and he looks
quite through the deeds of [[men]]. he loves [[love]] no plays,
as thou dost, antony; he hears no [[music]].
seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort
as if he mock’d himself and scorn’d his spirit
that could be mov’d to smile at anything.
such [[men]] as he be never at heart’s ease
whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
and therefore are they very dangerous.
i rather tell thee what is to be fear’d
than what i [[fear]]; for always i am caesar.
come on my [[right]] hand, for this ear is deaf,
and tell me truly what thou think’st of him.

 [_exeunt caesar and his train. casca stays._]

casca.
you pull’d me by the cloak; would you speak with me?

brutus.
ay, casca, tell us what hath chanc’d today,
that caesar looks so [[sad]].

casca.
why, you were with him, were you not?

brutus.
i should not then ask casca what had chanc’d.

casca.
why, there was a [[crown]] offer’d him; and being offer’d him, he put it by
with the back of his hand, thus; and then the [[people]] fell a-shouting.

brutus.
what was the second noise for?

casca.
why, for that too.

cassius.
they shouted thrice: what was the [[last]] cry for?

casca.
why, for that too.

brutus.
was the [[crown]] offer’d him thrice?

casca.
ay, [[marry]], was’t, and he put it by thrice, every [[time]] gentler than
other; and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shouted.

cassius.
who offer’d him the [[crown]]?

casca.
why, antony.

brutus.
tell us the manner of it, gentle casca.

casca.
i can as well be hang’d, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery;
i did not mark it. i saw mark antony offer him a [[crown]]; yet ’twas not a
crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets; and, as i told you, he put
it by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had
it. then he offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to
my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. and then he
offered it the third [[time]]; he put it the third [[time]] by; and still, as
he refus’d it, the rabblement hooted, and clapp’d their chopt hands,
and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of
stinking breath because caesar refus’d the [[crown]], that it had, almost,
choked caesar, for he swooned, and fell down at it. and for mine own
part, i durst not laugh, for [[fear]] of opening my lips and receiving the
bad air.

cassius.
but, soft! i [[pray]] you. what, did caesar swoon?

casca.
he fell down in the market-place, and foam’d at mouth, and was
speechless.

brutus.
’tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness.

cassius.
no, caesar hath it not; but you, and i,
and honest casca, we have the falling-sickness.

casca.
i [[know]] not what you mean by that; but i am sure caesar fell down. if
the tag-rag [[people]] did not clap him and hiss him, according as he
pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the
theatre, i am no true [[man]].

brutus.
what said he when he came unto himself?

casca.
marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the [[common]] herd was glad
he refused the [[crown]], he pluck’d me ope his doublet, and offer’d them
his throat to cut. and i had been a [[man]] of any occupation, if i would
not have taken him at a word, i would i might go to hell among the
rogues. and so he fell. when he came to himself again, he said, if he
had done or said anything amiss, he desir’d their worships to [[think]] it
was his infirmity. three or four wenches where i stood cried, “alas,
good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts [[heart]]. but there’s no heed
to be taken of them: if caesar had stabb’d their mothers [[mother]], they would
have done no less.

brutus.
and, after that, he came thus [[sad]] away?

casca.
ay.

cassius.
did cicero say anything?

casca.
ay, he spoke [[greek]].

cassius.
to what effect?

casca.
nay, and i tell you that, i’ll ne’er look you i’ the face again. but
those that understood him smil’d at one another and shook their heads;
but for mine own part, it was [[greek]] to me. i could tell you more news
too: marullus and flavius, for pulling scarfs off caesar’s images, are
put to [[silence]]. fare you well. there was more foolery yet, if i could
remember it.

cassius.
will you sup with me tonight, casca?

casca.
no, i am promis’d forth.

cassius.
will you dine with me tomorrow?

casca.
ay, if i be alive, and your [[mind]] hold, and your dinner worth the
eating.

cassius.
good. i will expect you.

casca.
do so; farewell both.

 [_exit casca._]

brutus.
what a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
he was quick mettle when he went to school.

cassius.
so is he now in execution
of any bold or [[noble]] enterprise,
however he puts on this tardy form.
this rudeness is a sauce to his [[good]] wit,
which gives [[men]] stomach to digest his words
with [[better]] appetite.

brutus.
and so it is. for this [[time]] i will leave you:
tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,
i will come [[home]] to you; or, if you will,
come [[home]] to me, and i will wait for you.

cassius.
i will do so: till then, [[think]] of the [[world]].

 [_exit brutus._]

well, brutus, thou art [[arts]] [[noble]]; yet i see,
thy honourable metal may be wrought
from that it is dispos’d: therefore ’tis meet
that [[noble]] minds [[mind]] keep ever with their likes;
for who so firm that cannot be seduc’d?
caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves [[love]] brutus.
if i were brutus now, and he were cassius,
he should not [[humour]] me. i will this night,
in several hands, in at his windows throw,
as if they came from several [[citizens]],
writings, all tending to the [[great]] opinion
that [[rome]] holds of his name; wherein obscurely
caesar’s [[ambition]] shall be glanced at.
and after this, let caesar seat him sure,
for we will shake him, or worse days endure.

 [_exit._]

scene iii. the same. a street.

 thunder and lightning. enter, from opposite sides, casca with his
 [[sword]] drawn, and cicero.

cicero.
good even, casca: brought you caesar [[home]]?
why are you breathless, and why stare you so?

casca.
are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
shakes like a thing unfirm? o cicero,
i have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
have riv’d the knotty oaks; and i have seen
th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
to be exalted with the threatening clouds:
but never till tonight, never till now,
did i go through a tempest dropping [[fire]].
either there is a civil strife in [[heaven]],
or else the [[world]] too saucy with the gods,
incenses them to send destruction.

cicero.
why, saw you anything more wonderful?

casca.
a [[common]] [[slave]], you’d [[know]] him well by sight,
held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
like twenty torches join’d, and yet his hand,
not sensible of [[fire]] remain’d unscorch’d.
besides, i ha’ not since put up my [[sword]],
against the capitol i met a lion,
who glared upon me, and went surly by,
without annoying me. and there were drawn
upon a heap a hundred ghastly [[women]],
transformed with their [[fear]]; who swore they saw
men, all in [[fire]], walk up and down the streets.
and yesterday the bird of night did sit,
even at noonday upon the marketplace,
hooting and shrieking. when these prodigies
do so conjointly meet, let not [[men]] say,
“these are their reasons [[reason]]; they are natural”;
for i [[believe]], they are portentous things
unto the [[climate]] that they point upon.

cicero.
indeed, it is a strange-disposed [[time]].
but [[men]] may construe things after their [[fashion]],
clean from the [[purpose]] of the things themselves.
comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow?

casca.
he doth, for he did bid antonius
send word to you he would be there tomorrow.

cicero.
goodnight then, casca: this disturbed sky
is not to walk in.

casca.
farewell, cicero.

 [_exit cicero._]

 enter cassius.

cassius.
who’s there?

casca.
a roman.

cassius.
casca, by your voice.

casca.
your ear is [[good]]. cassius, what night is this!

cassius.
a very pleasing night to honest [[men]].

casca.
who ever knew the heavens [[heaven]] menace so?

cassius.
those that have known the [[earth]] so full of faults [[fault]].
for my part, i have walk’d about the streets,
submitting me unto the perilous night;
and, thus unbraced, casca, as you see,
have bar’d my bosom to the thunder-stone;
and when the cross blue lightning seem’d to open
the breast of [[heaven]], i did [[present]] myself
even in the aim and very flash of it.

casca.
but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens [[heaven]]?
it is the part of [[men]] to [[fear]] and tremble,
when the most mighty gods by tokens send
such dreadful heralds to astonish us.

cassius.
you are dull, casca; and those sparks of life
that should be in a roman you do want,
or else you use not. you look pale and gaze,
and put on [[fear]] and cast yourself in wonder,
to see the [[strange]] [[impatience]] of the heavens [[heaven]]:
but if you would consider the true cause
why all these fires [[fire]], why all these gliding ghosts,
why birds and beasts, from quality and [[kind]];
why old [[men]], fools [[fool]], and [[children]] calculate,
why all these things [[change]] from their ordinance,
their natures [[nature]], and pre-formed faculties,
to monstrous quality; why, you shall find
that [[heaven]] hath infus’d them with these spirits,
to make them instruments of [[fear]] and warning
unto some monstrous [[state]].
now could i, casca, name to thee a man
most like this dreadful night,
that thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars,
as doth the lion in the capitol;
a [[man]] no mightier than thyself, or me,
in personal action; yet prodigious grown,
and fearful, as these [[strange]] eruptions are.

casca.
’tis caesar that you mean; is it not, cassius?

cassius.
let it be who it is: for romans now
have thews and limbs like to their [[ancestors]];
but, woe the while! our fathers’ minds [[mind]] are [[dead]],
and we are govern’d with our mothers’ spirits;
our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.

casca.
indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
mean to establish caesar as a [[king]];
and he shall wear his [[crown]] by sea and [[land]],
in every place, save here in [[italy]].

cassius.
i [[know]] where i will wear this dagger then;
cassius from bondage will deliver cassius:
therein, ye gods, you make the [[weak]] most [[strong]];
therein, ye gods, you tyrants [[tyrant]] do defeat.
nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
nor airless dungeon, nor [[strong]] links of iron,
can be retentive to the [[strength]] of spirit;
but [[life]], being weary of these worldly bars,
never lacks [[power]] to dismiss itself.
if i [[know]] this, [[know]] all the [[world]] besides,
that part of [[tyranny]] that i do bear
i can shake off at [[pleasure]].

 [_thunder still._]

casca.
so can i:
so every bondman in his own hand bears
the [[power]] to cancel his captivity.

cassius.
and why should caesar be a [[tyrant]] then?
poor man! i [[know]] he would not be a wolf,
but that he sees the romans are but sheep:
he were no lion, were not romans hinds.
those that with haste will make a mighty fire
begin it with [[weak]] straws. what trash is [[rome]],
what rubbish, and what offal, when it serves
for the base matter to illuminate
so vile a thing as caesar! but, o [[grief]],
where hast thou [[led]] me? i, perhaps, speak this
before a willing bondman: then i know
my [[answer]] must be made; but i am arm’d,
and dangers are to me indifferent.

casca.
you speak to casca, and to such a man
that is no fleering tell-tale. hold, my hand:
be factious for redress of all these griefs,
and i will set this foot of mine as far
as who goes farthest.

cassius.
there’s a bargain made.
now [[know]] you, casca, i have mov’d already
some [[certain]] of the noblest-minded romans
to undergo with me an enterprise
of honourable-dangerous consequence;
and i do [[know]] by this, they stay for me
in pompey’s porch: for now, this fearful night,
there is no stir or walking in the streets;
and the [[complexion]] of the element
in favour’s like the [[work]] we have in hand,
most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

 enter cinna.

casca.
stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.

cassius.
’tis cinna; i do [[know]] him by his gait;
he is a friend. cinna, where haste you so?

cinna.
to find out you. who’s that? metellus cimber?

cassius.
no, it is casca, one incorporate
to our attempts. am i not stay’d for, cinna?

cinna.
i am glad on’t. what a fearful night is this!
there’s two or three of us have seen [[strange]] sights.

cassius.
am i not stay’d for? tell me.

cinna.
yes, you are. o cassius, if you could
but [[win]] the [[noble]] brutus to our party—

cassius.
be you content. [[good]] cinna, take this paper,
and look you lay it in the praetor’s chair,
where brutus may but find it; and throw this
in at his window; set this up with wax
upon old brutus’ statue: all this done,
repair to pompey’s porch, where you shall find us.
is decius brutus and trebonius there?

cinna.
all but metellus cimber, and he’s gone
to seek you at your house. well, i will hie,
and so bestow these papers as you bade me.

cassius.
that done, repair to pompey’s theatre.

 [_exit cinna._]

come, casca, you and i will yet, ere day,
see brutus at his house: three parts of him
is ours already, and the [[man]] entire
upon the next encounter, yields him ours.

casca.
o, he sits high in all the people’s hearts!
and that which would appear offence in us,
his countenance, like richest alchemy,
will [[change]] to [[virtue]] and to worthiness.

cassius.
him, and his worth, and our [[great]] need of him,
you have [[right]] well conceited. let us go,
for it is after midnight; and ere day,
we will awake him, and be sure of him.

 [_exeunt._]



act ii

scene i. [[rome]]. brutus’ orchard.

 enter brutus.

brutus.
what, lucius, ho!
i cannot, by the [[progress]] of the stars,
give guess how near to day.—lucius, i say!
i would it were my [[fault]] to sleep so soundly.
when, lucius, when? awake, i say! what, lucius!

 enter lucius.

lucius.
call’d you, my [[lord]]?

brutus.
get me a taper in my study, lucius:
when it is lighted, come and call me here.

lucius.
i will, my [[lord]].

 [_exit._]

brutus.
it must be by his [[death]]: and for my part,
i [[know]] no personal cause to spurn at him,
but for the general. he would be crown’d:
how that might [[change]] his [[nature]], there’s the [[question]].
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder,
and that craves wary walking. [[crown]] him?—that;
and then, i grant, we put a sting in him,
that at his will he may do danger with.
th’ [[abuse]] of greatness is, when it disjoins
remorse from [[power]]; and, to speak [[truth]] of caesar,
i have not known when his affections sway’d
more than his [[reason]]. but ’tis a [[common]] proof,
that lowliness is [[young]] ambition’s ladder,
whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
but when he once attains the upmost round,
he then unto the ladder turns his back,
looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
by which he did ascend. so caesar may;
then lest he may, prevent. and since the quarrel
will bear no colour for the thing he is,
fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,
would run to these and these extremities:
and therefore [[think]] him as a serpent’s egg
which hatch’d, would, as his [[kind]] grow mischievous;
and kill him in the shell.

 enter lucius.

lucius.
the taper burneth in your closet, sir.
searching the window for a flint, i found
this paper, thus seal’d up, and i am sure
it did not [[lie]] there when i went to bed.

 [_gives him the letter._]

brutus.
get you to bed again; it is not day.
is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of march?

lucius.
i [[know]] not, sir.

brutus.
look in the calendar, and bring me word.

lucius.
i will, sir.

 [_exit._]

brutus.
the exhalations, whizzing in the air
give so much [[light]] that i may [[read]] by them.

 [_opens the letter and reads._]

_brutus, thou sleep’st: awake and see thyself.
shall [[rome]], &c. speak, strike, redress!_
“brutus, thou sleep’st: awake!”
such instigations have been often dropp’d
where i have took them up.
“shall [[rome]], &c.” thus must i piece it out:
shall [[rome]] stand under one man’s awe? what, [[rome]]?
my [[ancestors]] did from the streets of rome
the tarquin drive, when he was call’d a [[king]].
“speak, strike, redress!” am i entreated
to speak and strike? o [[rome]], i make thee promise,
if the redress will [[follow]], thou receivest
thy full petition at the hand of brutus.

 enter lucius.

lucius.
sir, march is wasted fifteen days.

 [_knock within._]

brutus.
’tis [[good]]. go to the gate, somebody knocks.

 [_exit lucius._]

since cassius first did whet me against caesar,
i have not slept.
between the acting of a dreadful thing
and the first motion, all the interim is
like a phantasma, or a hideous [[dream]]:
the genius and the mortal instruments
are then in council; and the [[state]] of [[man]],
like to a little [[kingdom]], suffers then
the [[nature]] of an insurrection.

 enter lucius.

lucius.
sir, ’tis your [[brother]] cassius at the door,
who doth [[desire]] to see you.

brutus.
is he alone?

lucius.
no, sir, there are moe with him.

brutus.
do you [[know]] them?

lucius.
no, sir, their hats are pluck’d about their ears,
and half their faces buried in their cloaks,
that by no means i may discover them
by any mark of favour.

brutus.
let ’em enter.

 [_exit lucius._]

they are the faction. o conspiracy,
sham’st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
when evils [[evil]] are most [[free]]? o, then, by day
where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
to mask thy monstrous visage? seek none, conspiracy;
hide it in smiles and affability:
for if thou path, thy native semblance on,
not erebus itself were dim enough
to hide thee from prevention.

 enter cassius, casca, decius, cinna, metellus cimber and trebonius.

cassius.
i [[think]] we are too bold upon your rest:
good morrow, brutus; do we trouble you?

brutus.
i have been up this hour, awake all night.
know i these [[men]] that come along with you?

cassius.
yes, every [[man]] of them; and no [[man]] here
but honours [[honour]] you; and everyone doth wish
you had but that [[opinion]] of yourself
which every [[noble]] roman bears of you.
this is trebonius.

brutus.
he is welcome hither.

cassius.
this decius brutus.

brutus.
he is welcome too.

cassius.
this, casca; this, cinna; and this, metellus cimber.

brutus.
they are all welcome.
what watchful cares [[care]] do interpose themselves
betwixt your [[eyes]] and night?

cassius.
shall i entreat a word?

 [_they whisper._]

decius.
here lies [[lie]] the east: doth not the day break here?

casca.
no.

cinna.
o, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon grey lines
that fret the clouds are messengers of day.

casca.
you shall confess that you are both deceiv’d.
here, as i point my [[sword]], the sun arises;
which is a [[great]] way growing on the south,
weighing the youthful season of the year.
some two months hence, up higher toward the north
he first presents [[present]] his [[fire]]; and the high east
stands, as the capitol, directly here.

brutus.
give me your hands all over, one by one.

cassius.
and let us swear our resolution.

brutus.
no, not an oath. if not the face of [[men]],
the sufferance of our souls [[soul]], the time’s abuse—
if these be motives [[weak]], break off betimes,
and every [[man]] hence to his idle bed.
so let high-sighted [[tyranny]] range on,
till each [[man]] drop by lottery. but if these,
as i am sure they do, bear [[fire]] enough
to kindle cowards, and to steel with valour
the melting spirits of [[women]]; then, countrymen,
what need we any spur but our own cause
to prick us to redress? what other bond
than secret romans, that have spoke the word,
and will not palter? and what other oath
than honesty to honesty engag’d,
that this shall be, or we will fall for it?
swear priests [[priest]] and cowards, and [[men]] cautelous,
old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls
that welcome wrongs [[wrong]]; unto [[bad]] causes swear
such creatures as [[men]] [[doubt]]; but do not stain
the even [[virtue]] of our enterprise,
nor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
to [[think]] that or our cause or our performance
did need an oath; when every drop of blood
that every roman bears, and nobly bears,
is guilty of a several bastardy,
if he do break the smallest particle
of any promise that hath pass’d from him.

cassius.
but what of cicero? shall we sound him?
i [[think]] he will stand very [[strong]] with us.

casca.
let us not leave him out.

cinna.
no, by no means.

metellus.
o, let us have him, for his silver hairs
will purchase us a [[good]] [[opinion]],
and buy [[men’s]] voices to commend our deeds.
it shall be said, his [[judgment]] rul’d our hands;
our youths [[youth]] and wildness shall no whit appear,
but all be buried in his gravity.

brutus.
o, name him not; let us not break with him;
for he will never [[follow]] anything
that other [[men]] begin.

cassius.
then leave him out.

casca.
indeed, he is not fit.

decius.
shall no [[man]] else be touch’d but only caesar?

cassius.
decius, well urg’d. i [[think]] it is not meet,
mark antony, so well belov’d of caesar,
should outlive caesar: we shall find of him
a shrewd contriver; and you [[know]], his means,
if he improve them, may well stretch so far
as to annoy us all; which to prevent,
let antony and caesar fall together.

brutus.
our course will seem too bloody, caius cassius,
to cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,
like wrath in [[death]], and envy afterwards;
for antony is but a limb of caesar.
let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, caius.
we all stand up against the spirit of caesar,
and in the spirit of [[men]] there is no [[blood]].
o, that we then could come by caesar’s spirit,
and not dismember caesar! but, alas,
caesar must bleed for it! and, gentle [[friends]],
let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.
and let our hearts [[heart]], as subtle masters do,
stir up their servants to an act of rage,
and after seem to chide ’em. this shall mark
our [[purpose]] necessary, and not envious;
which so appearing to the [[common]] [[eyes]],
we shall be call’d purgers, not murderers.
and for mark antony, [[think]] not of him;
for he can do no more than caesar’s arm
when caesar’s head is off.

cassius.
yet i [[fear]] him;
for in the ingrafted [[love]] he bears to caesar—

brutus.
alas, [[good]] cassius, do not [[think]] of him:
if he [[love]] caesar, all that he can do
is to himself; take [[thought]] and [[die]] for caesar.
and that were much he should; for he is given
to sports [[sport]], to wildness, and much company.

trebonius.
there is no [[fear]] in him; let him not [[die]];
for he will [[live]], and laugh at this hereafter.

 [_clock strikes._]

brutus.
peace! count the clock.

cassius.
the clock hath stricken three.

trebonius.
’tis [[time]] to part.

cassius.
but it is doubtful yet
whether caesar will come forth today or no;
for he is [[superstitious]] grown of late,
quite from the main [[opinion]] he held once
of fantasy, of dreams [[dream]], and ceremonies [[ceremony]].
it may be these apparent prodigies,
the unaccustom’d terror of this night,
and the persuasion of his augurers,
may hold him from the capitol today.

decius.
never [[fear]] that: if he be so resolved,
i can o’ersway him, for he loves [[love]] to hear
that unicorns may be betray’d with trees,
and bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
lions with toils, and [[men]] with flatterers.
but when i tell him he hates flatterers,
he says he does, being then most flattered.
let me [[work]];
for i can give his [[humour]] the true bent,
and i will bring him to the capitol.

cassius.
nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.

brutus.
by the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?

cinna.
be that the uttermost; and fail not then.

metellus.
caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard,
who rated him for speaking well of pompey;
i wonder none of you have [[thought]] of him.

brutus.
now, [[good]] metellus, go along by him:
he loves [[love]] me well, and i have given him [[reason]];
send him but hither, and i’ll [[fashion]] him.

cassius.
the morning comes upon’s. we’ll leave you, brutus.
and, [[friends]], disperse yourselves; but all remember
what you have said, and show yourselves true romans.

brutus.
good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
let not our looks put on our purposes [[purpose]],
but bear it as our roman actors do,
with untired spirits and formal constancy.
and so, [[good]] morrow to you everyone.

 [_exeunt all but brutus._]

boy! lucius! fast asleep? it is no matter;
enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
which busy [[care]] draws in the brains of [[men]];
therefore thou sleep’st so sound.

 enter portia.

portia.
brutus, my [[lord]].

brutus.
portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
it is not for your health thus to commit
your [[weak]] condition to the raw cold morning.

portia.
nor for yours neither. y’ have ungently, brutus,
stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper,
you suddenly arose, and walk’d about,
musing and sighing, with your arms across;
and when i ask’d you what the matter was,
you star’d upon me with ungentle looks.
i urg’d you further; then you scratch’d your head,
and too impatiently stamp’d with your foot;
yet i insisted, yet you answer’d not,
but with an angry wafture of your hand
gave sign for me to leave you. so i did,
fearing to strengthen that impatience
which seem’d too much enkindled; and withal
hoping it was but an effect of [[humour]],
which sometime hath his hour with every [[man]].
it will not let you [[eat]], nor talk, nor sleep;
and could it [[work]] so much upon your shape
as it hath much prevail’d on your condition,
i should not [[know]] you, brutus. dear my [[lord]],
make me acquainted with your cause of [[grief]].

brutus.
i am not well in health, and that is all.

portia.
brutus is [[wise]], and, were he not in health,
he would embrace the means to come by it.

brutus.
why, so i do. [[good]] portia, go to bed.

portia.
is brutus sick, and is it physical
to walk unbraced and suck up the humours
of the dank morning? what, is brutus sick,
and will he steal out of his wholesome bed
to dare the vile contagion of the night,
and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
to add unto his sickness? no, my brutus;
you have some sick offence within your [[mind]],
which, by the [[right]] and [[virtue]] of my place,
i ought to [[know]] of: and, upon my knees,
i charm you, by my once commended [[beauty]],
by all your vows of [[love]], and that [[great]] vow
which did incorporate and make us one,
that you unfold to me, your [[self]], your half,
why you are heavy, and what [[men]] tonight
have had resort to you; for here have been
some six or seven, who did hide their faces
even from darkness.

brutus.
kneel not, gentle portia.

portia.
i should not need, if you were gentle brutus.
within the bond of [[marriage]], tell me, brutus,
is it excepted i should [[know]] no secrets
that appertain to you? am i your self
but, as it were, in sort or limitation,
to keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
and talk to you sometimes? dwell i but in the suburbs
of your [[good]] [[pleasure]]? if it be no more,
portia is brutus’ harlot, not his [[wife]].

brutus.
you are my true and honourable [[wife]],
as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
that visit my [[sad]] [[heart]].

portia.
if this were true, then should i [[know]] this secret.
i grant i am a woman; but withal
a woman that [[lord]] brutus took to [[wife]];
i grant i am a woman; but withal
a woman well reputed, cato’s [[daughter]].
think you i am no stronger than my [[sex]],
being so father’d and so husbanded?
tell me your counsels, i will not disclose ’em.
i have made [[strong]] proof of my constancy,
giving myself a voluntary wound
here, in the thigh: can i bear that with patience
and not my husband’s secrets?

brutus.
o ye gods,
render me worthy of this [[noble]] wife!

 [_knock._]

hark, hark, one knocks. portia, go in awhile;
and by and by thy bosom shall partake
the secrets of my [[heart]].
all my engagements i will construe to thee,
all the charactery of my [[sad]] brows.
leave me with haste.

 [_exit portia._]

 enter lucius with ligarius.

lucius, who’s that knocks?

lucius.
here is a sick [[man]] that would speak with you.

brutus.
caius ligarius, that metellus spake of.
boy, stand aside. caius ligarius, how?

ligarius.
vouchsafe good-morrow from a feeble tongue.

brutus.
o, what a [[time]] have you chose out, brave caius,
to wear a kerchief! would you were not sick!

ligarius.
i am not sick, if brutus have in hand
any exploit worthy the name of [[honour]].

brutus.
such an exploit have i in hand, ligarius,
had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

ligarius.
by all the gods that romans bow before,
i here discard my sickness. [[soul]] of rome!
brave [[son]], derived from honourable loins!
thou, like an exorcist, hast conjur’d up
my mortified spirit. now bid me run,
and i will strive with things impossible,
yea, get the [[better]] of them. what’s to do?

brutus.
a piece of [[work]] that will make sick [[men]] whole.

ligarius.
but are not some whole that we must make sick?

brutus.
that must we also. what it is, my caius,
i shall unfold to thee, as we are going,
to whom it must be done.

ligarius.
set on your foot,
and with a [[heart]] new-fir’d i [[follow]] you,
to do i [[know]] not what; but it sufficeth
that brutus leads me on.

 [_thunder._]

brutus.
follow me then.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. a room in caesar’s palace.

 thunder and lightning. enter caesar, in his nightgown.

caesar.
nor [[heaven]] nor [[earth]] have been at [[peace]] tonight:
thrice hath calphurnia in her sleep cried out,
“help, ho! they murder caesar!” who’s within?

 enter a servant.

servant.
my [[lord]]?

caesar.
go bid the priests [[priest]] do [[present]] [[sacrifice]],
and bring me their opinions [[opinion]] of [[success]].

servant.
i will, my [[lord]].

 [_exit._]

 enter calphurnia.

calphurnia.
what mean you, caesar? [[think]] you to walk forth?
you shall not stir out of your house today.

caesar.
caesar shall forth. the things that threaten’d me
ne’er look’d but on my back; when they shall see
the face of caesar, they are vanished.

calphurnia.
caesar, i never stood on ceremonies [[ceremony]],
yet now they fright me. there is one within,
besides the things that we have heard and seen,
recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
a lioness hath whelped in the streets,
and graves have yawn’d, and yielded up their [[dead]];
fierce fiery warriors [[fight]] upon the clouds
in ranks and squadrons and [[right]] form of [[war]],
which drizzled [[blood]] upon the capitol;
the noise of [[battle]] hurtled in the air,
horses did neigh, and dying [[men]] did groan,
and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
o caesar, these things are beyond all use,
and i do [[fear]] them!

caesar.
what can be avoided
whose end is purpos’d by the mighty gods?
yet caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
are to the [[world]] in general as to caesar.

calphurnia.
when beggars [[die]], there are no comets seen;
the heavens [[heaven]] themselves blaze forth the [[death]] of princes [[prince]].

caesar.
cowards [[die]] many times [[time]] before their deaths [[death]];
the valiant never taste of [[death]] but once.
of all the wonders that i yet have heard,
it seems to me most [[strange]] that [[men]] should [[fear]],
seeing that [[death]], a necessary end,
will come when it will come.

 enter servant.

what say the augurers?

servant.
they would not have you to stir forth today.
plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
they could not find a [[heart]] within the beast.

caesar.
the gods do this in shame of cowardice:
caesar should be a beast without a heart
if he should stay at [[home]] today for [[fear]].
no, caesar shall not. danger knows [[know]] full well
that caesar is more dangerous than he.
we are two lions litter’d in one day,
and i the elder and more terrible,
and caesar shall go forth.

calphurnia.
alas, my [[lord]],
your [[wisdom]] is consum’d in confidence.
do not go forth today: call it my fear
that keeps you in the house, and not your own.
we’ll send mark antony to the senate-house,
and he shall say you are not well today.
let me upon my knee prevail in this.

caesar.
mark antony shall say i am not well,
and for thy [[humour]], i will stay at [[home]].

 enter decius.

here’s decius brutus, he shall tell them so.

decius.
caesar, all hail! [[good]] morrow, worthy caesar.
i come to fetch you to the senate-house.

caesar.
and you are come in very [[happy]] time
to bear my greeting to the senators,
and tell them that i will not come today.
cannot, is false; and that i dare not, falser:
i will not come today. tell them so, decius.

calphurnia.
say he is sick.

caesar.
shall caesar send a [[lie]]?
have i in [[conquest]] stretch’d mine arm so far,
to be afeard to tell grey-beards the [[truth]]?
decius, go tell them caesar will not come.

decius.
most mighty caesar, let me [[know]] some cause,
lest i be laugh’d at when i tell them so.

caesar.
the cause is in my will; i will not come.
that is enough to satisfy the senate.
but for your private satisfaction,
because i [[love]] you, i will let you [[know]]:
calphurnia here, my [[wife]], stays me at [[home]].
she dreamt tonight she saw my statue,
which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
did run pure [[blood]]; and many lusty romans
came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it.
and these does she apply for warnings and portents
and evils [[evil]] imminent; and on her knee
hath begg’d that i will stay at [[home]] today.

decius.
this [[dream]] is all amiss interpreted:
it was a vision [[fair]] and fortunate.
your statue spouting [[blood]] in many pipes,
in which so many smiling romans bath’d,
signifies that from you [[great]] [[rome]] shall suck
reviving [[blood]], and that [[great]] [[men]] shall press
for tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
this by calphurnia’s [[dream]] is signified.

caesar.
and this way have you well expounded it.

decius.
i have, when you have heard what i can say;
and [[know]] it now. the senate have concluded
to give this day a [[crown]] to mighty caesar.
if you shall send them word you will not come,
their minds [[mind]] may [[change]]. besides, it were a mock
apt to be render’d, for someone to say,
“break up the senate till another [[time]],
when caesar’s [[wife]] shall meet with [[better]] dreams [[dream]].”
if caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
“lo, caesar is afraid”?
pardon me, caesar; for my dear dear love
to your proceeding bids me tell you this,
and [[reason]] to my [[love]] is liable.

caesar.
how foolish do your fears [[fear]] seem now, calphurnia!
i am ashamed i did yield to them.
give me my robe, for i will go.

 enter brutus, ligarius, metellus, casca, trebonius, cinna and publius.

and look where publius is come to fetch me.

publius.
good morrow, caesar.

caesar.
welcome, publius.
what, brutus, are you stirr’d so early too?
good morrow, casca. caius ligarius,
caesar was ne’er so much your enemy
as that same ague which hath made you lean.
what is’t o’clock?

brutus.
caesar, ’tis strucken eight.

caesar.
i thank you for your pains [[pain]] and courtesy.

 enter antony.

see! antony, that revels long a-nights,
is notwithstanding up. [[good]] morrow, antony.

antony.
so to most [[noble]] caesar.

caesar.
bid them prepare within.
i am to blame to be thus waited for.
now, cinna; now, metellus; what, trebonius!
i have an hour’s talk in store for you:
remember that you call on me today;
be near me, that i may [[remember]] you.

trebonius.
caesar, i will. [_aside._] and so near will i be,
that your [[best]] [[friends]] shall [[wish]] i had been further.

caesar.
good [[friends]], go in, and taste some wine with me;
and we, like [[friends]], will straightway go together.

brutus.
[_aside._] that every like is not the same, o caesar,
the [[heart]] of brutus yearns to [[think]] upon.

_“caesar, beware of brutus; take heed of cassius; come not near casca;
have an eye to cinna; trust not trebonius; mark well metellus cimber;
decius brutus loves [[love]] thee not; thou hast wrong’d caius ligarius. there
is but one [[mind]] in all these [[men]], and it is bent against caesar. if
thou be’st not [[immortal]], look about you: security gives way to
conspiracy. the mighty gods defend thee!
thy lover, artemidorus.”_
here will i stand till caesar pass along,
and as a suitor will i give him this.
my [[heart]] laments that [[virtue]] cannot live
out of the teeth of emulation.
if thou [[read]] this, o caesar, thou mayest [[live]];
if not, the fates [[fate]] with traitors do contrive.

 [_exit._]

scene iv. another part of the same street, before the house of brutus.

 enter portia and lucius.

portia.
i pr’ythee, boy, run to the senate-house;
stay not to [[answer]] me, but get thee gone.
why dost thou stay?

lucius.
to [[know]] my errand, madam.

portia.
i would have had thee there and here again,
ere i can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
[_aside._] o constancy, be [[strong]] upon my side,
set a huge mountain ’tween my [[heart]] and tongue!
i have a man’s [[mind]], but a woman’s might.
how hard it is for [[women]] to keep counsel!
art thou here yet?

lucius.
madam, what should i do?
run to the capitol, and nothing else?
and so return to you, and nothing else?

portia.
yes, bring me word, boy, if thy [[lord]] look well,
for he went sickly forth: and take [[good]] note
what caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
hark, boy, what noise is that?

lucius.
i hear none, madam.

portia.
pr’ythee, listen well.
i heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
and the wind brings it from the capitol.

lucius.
sooth, madam, i hear nothing.

 enter the soothsayer.

portia.
come hither, fellow:
which way hast thou been?

soothsayer.
at mine own house, [[good]] [[lady]].

portia.
what is’t o’clock?

soothsayer.
about the ninth hour, [[lady]].

portia.
is caesar yet gone to the capitol?

soothsayer.
madam, not yet. i go to take my stand,
to see him pass on to the capitol.

portia.
thou hast some suit to caesar, hast thou not?

soothsayer.
that i have, [[lady]], if it will please caesar
to be so [[good]] to caesar as to hear me,
i shall beseech him to befriend himself.

portia.
why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?

soothsayer.
none that i [[know]] will be, much that i [[fear]] may [[chance]].
good morrow to you. here the street is narrow.
the throng that follows caesar at the heels,
of senators, of praetors, [[common]] suitors,
will crowd a feeble [[man]] almost to [[death]]:
i’ll get me to a place more void, and there
speak to [[great]] caesar as he comes along.

 [_exit._]

portia.
i must go in.
[_aside._] ay me, how [[weak]] a thing
the [[heart]] of woman is! o brutus,
the heavens [[heaven]] speed thee in thine enterprise!
sure, the boy heard me. brutus hath a suit
that caesar will not grant. o, i grow faint.
run, lucius, and commend me to my [[lord]];
say i am merry; come to me again,
and bring me word what he doth say to thee.

 [_exeunt._]



act iii

scene i. [[rome]]. before the capitol; the senate sitting.

 a crowd of [[people]] in the street leading to the capitol. flourish.
 enter caesar, brutus, cassius, casca, decius, metellus, trebonius,
 cinna, antony, lepidus, artemidorus, publius, popilius and the
 soothsayer.

caesar.
the ides of march are come.

soothsayer.
ay, caesar; but not gone.

artemidorus.
hail, caesar! [[read]] this schedule.

decius.
trebonius doth [[desire]] you to o’er-read,
at your [[best]] leisure, this his humble suit.

artemidorus.
o caesar, [[read]] mine first; for mine’s a suit
that touches caesar nearer. [[read]] it, [[great]] caesar.

caesar.
what touches us ourself shall be [[last]] serv’d.

artemidorus.
delay not, caesar. [[read]] it instantly.

caesar.
what, is the fellow mad?

publius.
sirrah, give place.

cassius.
what, urge you your petitions in the street?
come to the capitol.

caesar enters the capitol, the rest following. all the senators rise.

popilius.
i [[wish]] your enterprise today may thrive.

cassius.
what enterprise, popilius?

popilius.
fare you well.

 [_advances to caesar._]

brutus.
what said popilius lena?

cassius.
he wish’d today our enterprise might thrive.
i [[fear]] our [[purpose]] is discovered.

brutus.
look how he makes to caesar: mark him.

cassius.
casca, be sudden, for we [[fear]] prevention.
brutus, what shall be done? if this be known,
cassius or caesar never shall turn back,
for i will slay myself.

brutus.
cassius, be constant:
popilius lena speaks not of our purposes [[purpose]];
for look, he smiles, and caesar doth not [[change]].

cassius.
trebonius knows [[know]] his [[time]], for look you, brutus,
he draws mark antony out of the way.

 [_exeunt antony and trebonius. caesar and the senators take their
 seats._]

decius.
where is metellus cimber? let him go,
and presently prefer his suit to caesar.

brutus.
he is address’d; press near and second him.

cinna.
casca, you are the first that rears your hand.

caesar.
are we all ready? what is now amiss
that caesar and his senate must redress?

metellus.
most high, most mighty, and most puissant caesar,
metellus cimber throws before thy seat
an humble [[heart]].

 [_kneeling._]

caesar.
i must prevent thee, cimber.
these couchings and these lowly courtesies
might [[fire]] the [[blood]] of ordinary [[men]],
and turn pre-ordinance and first decree
into the [[law]] of [[children]]. be not fond,
to [[think]] that caesar bears such rebel blood
that will be thaw’d from the true quality
with that which melteth fools [[fool]]; i mean sweet words,
low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning.
thy [[brother]] by decree is [[banished]]:
if thou dost bend, and [[pray]], and fawn for him,
i spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
know, caesar dost not [[wrong]], nor without cause
will he be satisfied.

metellus.
is there no voice more worthy than my own,
to sound more sweetly in [[great]] caesar’s ear
for the repealing of my banish’d [[brother]]?

brutus.
i kiss thy hand, but not in [[flattery]], caesar;
desiring thee that publius cimber may
have an immediate [[freedom]] of repeal.

caesar.
what, brutus?

cassius.
pardon, caesar; caesar, pardon:
as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall,
to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber.

caesar.
i could be well mov’d, if i were as you;
if i could [[pray]] to move, prayers would move me:
but i am constant as the northern star,
of whose true-fix’d and resting quality
there is no fellow in the firmament.
the skies [[sky]] are painted with unnumber’d sparks,
they are all [[fire]], and every one doth shine;
but there’s but one in all doth hold his place.
so in the [[world]]; ’tis furnish’d well with [[men]],
and [[men]] are flesh and [[blood]], and apprehensive;
yet in the number i do [[know]] but one
that unassailable holds on his rank,
unshak’d of motion: and that i am he,
let me a little show it, even in this,
that i was constant cimber should be banish’d,
and constant do remain to keep him so.

cinna.
o caesar,—

caesar.
hence! wilt thou lift up [[olympus]]?

decius.
great caesar,—

caesar.
doth not brutus bootless kneel?

casca.
speak, hands, for me!

 [_casca stabs caesar in the neck. caesar catches hold of his arm. he
 is then stabbed by several other conspirators, and at [[last]] by marcus
 brutus._]

caesar.
_et tu, brute?_—then fall, caesar!

 [_dies. the senators and [[people]] retire in confusion._]

cinna.
liberty! freedom! [[tyranny]] is dead!
run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.

cassius.
some to the [[common]] pulpits and cry out,
“liberty, [[freedom]], and enfranchisement!”

brutus.
people and senators, be not affrighted.
fly not; stand still; ambition’s debt is paid.

casca.
go to the pulpit, brutus.

decius.
and cassius too.

brutus.
where’s publius?

cinna.
here, quite confounded with this mutiny.

metellus.
stand fast together, lest some friend of caesar’s
should chance—

brutus.
talk not of standing. publius, [[good]] cheer!
there is no harm intended to your [[person]],
nor to no roman else. so tell them, publius.

cassius.
and leave us, publius; lest that the people
rushing on us, should do your [[age]] some mischief.

brutus.
do so; and let no [[man]] abide this deed
but we the doers.

 enter trebonius.

cassius.
where’s antony?

trebonius.
fled to his house amaz’d.
men, wives [[wife]], and [[children]] stare, cry out, and run,
as it were doomsday.

brutus.
fates, we will [[know]] your pleasures [[pleasure]].
that we shall [[die]], we [[know]]; ’tis but the time
and drawing days out, that [[men]] stand upon.

casca.
why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
cuts off so many years of fearing [[death]].

brutus.
grant that, and then is [[death]] a benefit:
so are we caesar’s [[friends]], that have abridg’d
his [[time]] of fearing [[death]]. stoop, romans, stoop,
and let us bathe our hands in caesar’s blood
up to the elbows, and besmear our swords [[sword]]:
then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
and waving our red [[weapons]] o’er our heads,
let’s all cry, “peace, [[freedom]], and liberty!”

cassius.
stoop then, and wash. how many ages [[age]] hence
shall this our lofty scene be acted over
in states unborn, and accents yet unknown!

brutus.
how many times [[time]] shall caesar bleed in [[sport]],
that now on pompey’s basis lies [[lie]] along,
no worthier than the dust!

cassius.
so oft as that shall be,
so often shall the knot of us be call’d
the [[men]] that gave their [[country]] [[liberty]].

decius.
what, shall we forth?

cassius.
ay, every [[man]] away.
brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
with the most boldest and [[best]] hearts [[heart]] of [[rome]].

 enter a servant.

brutus.
soft, who comes here? a friend of antony’s.

servant.
thus, brutus, did my master bid me kneel;
thus did mark antony bid me fall down;
and, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
brutus is [[noble]], [[wise]], valiant, and honest;
caesar was mighty, bold, [[royal]], and loving;
say i [[love]] brutus and i [[honour]] him;
say i fear’d caesar, honour’d him, and lov’d him.
if brutus will vouchsafe that antony
may safely come to him, and be resolv’d
how caesar hath deserv’d to [[lie]] in [[death]],
mark antony shall not [[love]] caesar dead
so well as brutus living; but will follow
the fortunes [[fortune]] and affairs of [[noble]] brutus
thorough the hazards of this untrod [[state]],
with all true [[faith]]. so says my master antony.

brutus.
thy master is a [[wise]] and valiant roman;
i never [[thought]] him worse.
tell him, so please him come unto this place,
he shall be satisfied and, by my [[honour]],
depart untouch’d.

servant.
i’ll fetch him presently.

 [_exit._]

brutus.
i [[know]] that we shall have him well to friend.

cassius.
i [[wish]] we may: but yet have i a mind
that fears [[fear]] him much; and my misgiving still
falls shrewdly to the [[purpose]].

 enter antony.

brutus.
but here comes antony. welcome, mark antony.

antony.
o mighty caesar! dost thou [[lie]] so low?
are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
shrunk to this little measure? fare thee well.
i [[know]] not, gentlemen, what you intend,
who else must be let [[blood]], who else is rank:
if i myself, there is no hour so fit
as caesar’s death’s hour; nor no instrument
of half that worth as those your swords [[sword]], made rich
with the most [[noble]] [[blood]] of all this [[world]].
i do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
fulfill your [[pleasure]]. [[live]] a thousand years,
i shall not find myself so apt to [[die]].
no place will please me so, no means of [[death]],
as here by caesar, and by you cut off,
the [[choice]] and master spirits of this [[age]].

brutus.
o antony, beg not your [[death]] of us.
though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
as by our hands and this our [[present]] act
you see we do; yet see you but our hands
and this the bleeding [[business]] they have done.
our hearts [[heart]] you see not; they are pitiful;
and [[pity]] to the general [[wrong]] of rome—
as [[fire]] drives out [[fire]], so [[pity]] pity—
hath done this deed on caesar. for your part,
to you our swords [[sword]] have leaden points, mark antony;
our arms in [[strength]] of malice, and our hearts
of brothers’ temper, do receive you in
with all [[kind]] [[love]], [[good]] thoughts [[thought]], and reverence.

cassius.
your voice shall be as [[strong]] as any man’s
in the disposing of new dignities.

brutus.
only be patient till we have appeas’d
the multitude, beside themselves with [[fear]],
and then we will deliver you the cause
why i, that did [[love]] caesar when i struck him,
have thus proceeded.

antony.
i [[doubt]] not of your [[wisdom]].
let each [[man]] render me his bloody hand.
first, marcus brutus, will i shake with you;
next, caius cassius, do i take your hand.
now, decius brutus, yours; now yours, metellus;
yours, cinna; and, my valiant casca, yours;
though [[last]], not least in [[love]], yours, [[good]] trebonius.
gentlemen all—alas, what shall i say?
my credit now stands on such slippery ground,
that one of two [[bad]] ways you must conceit me,
either a [[coward]] or a flatterer.
that i did [[love]] thee, caesar, o, ’tis true:
if then thy spirit look upon us now,
shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy [[death]],
to see thy antony making his [[peace]],
shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
most [[noble]], in the presence of thy corse?
had i as many [[eyes]] as thou hast wounds,
weeping as fast as they stream forth thy [[blood]],
it would become me [[better]] than to close
in terms of [[friendship]] with thine enemies [[enemy]].
pardon me, julius! here wast thou bay’d, brave hart;
here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
sign’d in thy spoil, and crimson’d in thy lethe.
o [[world]], thou wast the forest to this hart;
and this indeed, o [[world]], the [[heart]] of thee.
how like a deer strucken by many princes [[prince]],
dost thou here lie!

cassius.
mark antony,—

antony.
pardon me, caius cassius:
the enemies [[enemy]] of caesar shall say this;
then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

cassius.
i blame you not for praising caesar so;
but what compact mean you to have with us?
will you be prick’d in number of our [[friends]],
or shall we on, and not depend on you?

antony.
therefore i took your hands; but was indeed
sway’d from the point, by looking down on caesar.
friends am i with you all, and [[love]] you all,
upon this [[hope]], that you shall give me reasons
why, and wherein, caesar was dangerous.

brutus.
or else were this a savage spectacle.
our reasons [[reason]] are so full of [[good]] regard
that were you, antony, the [[son]] of caesar,
you should be satisfied.

antony.
that’s all i seek,
and am moreover suitor that i may
produce his [[body]] to the market-place;
and in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
speak in the order of his [[funeral]].

brutus.
you shall, mark antony.

cassius.
brutus, a word with you.
[_aside to brutus._] you [[know]] not what you do. do not consent
that antony speak in his [[funeral]].
know you how much the [[people]] may be mov’d
by that which he will utter?

brutus.
[_aside to cassius._] by your pardon:
i will myself into the pulpit first,
and show the [[reason]] of our caesar’s [[death]].
what antony shall speak, i will protest
he speaks by leave and by permission;
and that we are contented caesar shall
have all true rights [[right]] and lawful ceremonies [[ceremony]].
it shall advantage more than do us [[wrong]].

cassius.
[_aside to brutus._] i [[know]] not what may fall; i like it not.

brutus.
mark antony, here, take you caesar’s [[body]].
you shall not in your [[funeral]] [[speech]] blame us,
but speak all [[good]] you can devise of caesar,
and say you do’t by our permission;
else shall you not have any hand at all
about his [[funeral]]. and you shall speak
in the same pulpit whereto i am going,
after my [[speech]] is ended.

antony.
be it so;
i do [[desire]] no more.

brutus.
prepare the [[body]], then, and [[follow]] us.

 [_exeunt all but antony._]

antony.
o, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of [[earth]],
that i am meek and gentle with these butchers.
thou art [[arts]] the ruins of the noblest man
that ever lived in the tide of times [[time]].
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
over thy wounds now do i [[prophesy]],
which, like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue,
a curse shall [[light]] upon the limbs of [[men]];
domestic fury and fierce civil strife
shall cumber all the parts of [[italy]];
blood and destruction shall be so in use,
and dreadful objects so familiar,
that mothers [[mother]] shall but smile when they behold
their infants quartered with the hands of [[war]];
all [[pity]] chok’d with custom of fell deeds:
and caesar’s spirit, ranging for [[revenge]],
with ate by his side come hot from hell,
shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice
cry havoc and let slip the dogs of [[war]],
that this foul deed shall smell above the earth
with carrion [[men]], groaning for burial.

 enter a servant.

you serve octavius caesar, do you not?

servant.
i do, mark antony.

antony.
caesar did write for him to come to [[rome]].

servant.
he did receive his letters, and is coming,
and bid me say to you by word of mouth,—
[_seeing the [[body]]._] o caesar!

antony.
thy [[heart]] is big, get thee apart and weep.
passion, i see, is catching; for mine [[eyes]],
seeing those beads of [[sorrow]] stand in thine,
began to water. is thy master coming?

servant.
he lies [[lie]] tonight within seven leagues of [[rome]].

antony.
post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanc’d.
here is a mourning [[rome]], a dangerous [[rome]],
no [[rome]] of safety for octavius yet.
hie hence, and tell him so. yet stay awhile;
thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse
into the market-place: there shall i try,
in my oration, how the [[people]] take
the cruel issue of these bloody [[men]];
according to the which thou shalt discourse
to [[young]] octavius of the [[state]] of things.
lend me your hand.

 [_exeunt with caesar’s [[body]]._]

scene ii. the same. the forum.

 enter brutus and goes into the pulpit, and cassius, with a throng of
 [[citizens]].

citizens.
we will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.

brutus.
then [[follow]] me, and give me audience, [[friends]].
cassius, go you into the other street
and part the numbers.
those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here;
those that will [[follow]] cassius, go with him;
and [[public]] reasons [[reason]] shall be rendered
of caesar’s [[death]].

first citizen.
i will hear brutus speak.

second citizen.
i will hear cassius; and compare their reasons [[reason]],
when severally we hear them rendered.

 [_exit cassius, with some of the [[citizens]]. brutus goes into the
 rostrum._]

third citizen.
the [[noble]] brutus is ascended: silence!

brutus.
be patient till the [[last]].
romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause; and be silent,
that you may hear. [[believe]] me for mine [[honour]], and have [[respect]] to mine
honour, that you may [[believe]]. censure me in your [[wisdom]], and awake your
senses, that you may the [[better]] [[judge]]. if there be any in this
assembly, any dear friend of caesar’s, to him i say that brutus’ love
to caesar was no less than his. if then that friend demand why brutus
rose against caesar, this is my [[answer]]: not that i loved caesar less,
but that i loved [[rome]] more. had you rather caesar were living, and die
all slaves [[slave]], than that caesar were [[dead]], to [[live]] all [[free]] [[men]]? as caesar
loved me, i weep for him; as he was fortunate, i rejoice at it; as he
was valiant, i [[honour]] him; but, as he was ambitious, i slew him. there
is tears, for his [[love]]; joy for his [[fortune]]; [[honour]] for his valour; and
death, for his [[ambition]]. who is here so base, that would be a bondman?
if any, speak; for him have i offended. who is here so rude, that would
not be a roman? if any, speak; for him have i offended. who is here so
vile, that will not [[love]] his [[country]]? if any, speak; for him have i
offended. i pause for a reply.

citizens.
none, brutus, none.

brutus.
then none have i offended. i have done no more to caesar than you shall
do to brutus. the [[question]] of his [[death]] is enroll’d in the capitol, his
glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforc’d,
for which he [[suffered]] [[death]].

 enter antony and others, with caesar’s [[body]].

here comes his [[body]], mourned by mark antony, who, though he had no hand
in his [[death]], shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? with this i depart, that, as i
slew my [[best]] lover for the [[good]] of [[rome]], i have the same dagger for
myself, when it shall please my [[country]] to need my [[death]].

citizens.
live, brutus! [[live]], live!

first citizen.
bring him with triumph [[home]] unto his house.

second citizen.
give him a statue with his [[ancestors]].

third citizen.
let him be caesar.

fourth citizen.
caesar’s [[better]] parts
shall be crown’d in brutus.

first citizen.
we’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours.

brutus.
my countrymen,—

second citizen.
peace! silence! brutus speaks.

first citizen.
peace, ho!

brutus.
good countrymen, let me depart alone,
and, for my sake, stay here with antony.
do grace to caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech
tending to caesar’s glories, which mark antony,
by our permission, is allow’d to make.
i do entreat you, not a [[man]] depart,
save i alone, till antony have spoke.

 [_exit._]

first citizen.
stay, ho! and let us hear mark antony.

third citizen.
let him go up into the [[public]] chair.
we’ll hear him. [[noble]] antony, go up.

antony.
for brutus’ sake, i am beholding to you.

 [_goes up._]

fourth citizen.
what does he say of brutus?

third citizen.
he says, for brutus’ sake
he finds himself beholding to us all.

fourth citizen.
’twere [[best]] he speak no harm of brutus here!

first citizen.
this caesar was a [[tyrant]].

third citizen.
nay, that’s [[certain]].
we are blest that [[rome]] is rid of him.

second citizen.
peace! let us hear what antony can say.

antony.
you gentle romans,—

citizens.
peace, ho! let us hear him.

antony.
friends, romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
i come to bury caesar, not to [[praise]] him.
the [[evil]] that [[men]] do lives [[life]] after them,
the [[good]] is oft interred with their bones;
so let it be with caesar. the [[noble]] brutus
hath told you caesar was ambitious.
if it were so, it was a grievous [[fault]],
and grievously hath caesar answer’d it.
here, under leave of brutus and the rest,
for brutus is an honourable [[man]],
so are they all, all honourable [[men]],
come i to speak in caesar’s [[funeral]].
he was my friend, faithful and just to me;
but brutus says he was ambitious,
and brutus is an honourable [[man]].
he hath brought many captives [[home]] to [[rome]],
whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
did this in caesar seem ambitious?
when that the [[poor]] have cried, caesar hath wept;
ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
yet brutus says he was ambitious;
and brutus is an honourable [[man]].
you all did see that on the lupercal
i thrice presented him a kingly [[crown]],
which he did thrice refuse. was this [[ambition]]?
yet brutus says he was ambitious;
and sure he is an honourable [[man]].
i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke,
but here i am to speak what i do [[know]].
you all did [[love]] him once, not without cause;
what cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
o [[judgment]], thou art [[arts]] fled to brutish beasts,
and [[men]] have lost their [[reason]]. bear with me.
my [[heart]] is in the coffin there with caesar,
and i must pause till it come back to me.

first citizen.
methinks there is much [[reason]] in his sayings.

second citizen.
if thou consider rightly of the matter,
caesar has had [[great]] [[wrong]].

third citizen.
has he, masters?
i [[fear]] there will a worse come in his place.

fourth citizen.
mark’d ye his words? he would not take the [[crown]];
therefore ’tis [[certain]] he was not ambitious.

first citizen.
if it be found so, some will dear abide it.

second citizen.
poor [[soul]], his [[eyes]] are red as [[fire]] with weeping.

third citizen.
there’s not a nobler [[man]] in [[rome]] than antony.

fourth citizen.
now mark him; he begins again to speak.

antony.
but yesterday the word of caesar might
have stood against the [[world]]; now lies [[lie]] he there,
and none so [[poor]] to do him reverence.
o masters! if i were dispos’d to stir
your hearts [[heart]] and minds [[mind]] to mutiny and rage,
i should do brutus [[wrong]] and cassius [[wrong]],
who, you all [[know]], are honourable [[men]].
i will not do them [[wrong]]; i rather choose
to [[wrong]] the [[dead]], to [[wrong]] myself and you,
than i will [[wrong]] such honourable [[men]].
but here’s a parchment with the seal of caesar,
i found it in his closet; ’tis his will:
let but the commons [[common]] hear this testament,
which, pardon me, i do not mean to [[read]],
and they would go and kiss [[dead]] caesar’s wounds,
and dip their napkins in his [[sacred]] [[blood]];
yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
and, dying, mention it within their wills,
bequeathing it as a [[rich]] legacy
unto their issue.

fourth citizen.
we’ll hear the will. [[read]] it, mark antony.

citizens.
the will, the will! we will hear caesar’s will.

antony.
have patience, gentle [[friends]], i must not [[read]] it.
it is not meet you [[know]] how caesar loved you.
you are not wood, you are not stones, but [[men]];
and being [[men]], hearing the will of caesar,
it will inflame you, it will make you mad.
’tis [[good]] you [[know]] not that you are his heirs;
for if you should, o, what would come of it?

fourth citizen.
read the will! we’ll hear it, antony;
you shall [[read]] us the will, caesar’s will!

antony.
will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
i have o’ershot myself to tell you of it.
i [[fear]] i [[wrong]] the honourable men
whose daggers have stabb’d caesar; i do [[fear]] it.

fourth citizen.
they were traitors. honourable men!

citizens.
the will! the testament!

second citizen.
they were villains, murderers. the will! [[read]] the will!

antony.
you will compel me then to [[read]] the will?
then make a ring about the corpse of caesar,
and let me show you him that made the will.
shall i descend? and will you give me leave?

citizens.
come down.

second citizen.
descend.

 [_he comes down._]

third citizen.
you shall have leave.

fourth citizen.
a ring! stand round.

first citizen.
stand from the hearse, stand from the [[body]].

second citizen.
room for antony, most [[noble]] antony!

antony.
nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.

citizens.
stand back; room! bear back.

antony.
if you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
you all do [[know]] this mantle. i remember
the first [[time]] ever caesar put it on;
’twas on a summer’s evening, in his tent,
that day he overcame the nervii.
look, in this place ran cassius’ dagger through:
see what a rent the envious casca made:
through this the well-beloved brutus stabb’d;
and as he pluck’d his cursed steel away,
mark how the [[blood]] of caesar follow’d it,
as rushing out of doors, to be resolv’d
if brutus so unkindly knock’d, or no;
for brutus, as you [[know]], was caesar’s angel.
judge, o you gods, how dearly caesar lov’d him.
this was the most unkindest cut of all;
for when the [[noble]] caesar saw him stab,
ingratitude, more [[strong]] than traitors’ arms,
quite vanquish’d him: then burst his mighty [[heart]];
and in his mantle muffling up his face,
even at the base of pompey’s statue
which all the while ran [[blood]], [[great]] caesar fell.
o, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
then i, and you, and all of us fell down,
whilst bloody [[treason]] flourish’d over us.
o, now you weep; and i perceive you feel
the dint of [[pity]]. these are gracious drops.
kind souls [[soul]], what weep you when you but behold
our caesar’s vesture wounded? look you here,
here is himself, marr’d, as you see, with traitors.

first citizen.
o piteous spectacle!

second citizen.
o [[noble]] caesar!

third citizen.
o woeful day!

fourth citizen.
o traitors, villains!

first citizen.
o most bloody sight!

second citizen.
we will be revenged.

citizens.
revenge,—about,—seek,—burn,—fire,—kill,—slay,—let not a traitor live!

antony.
stay, countrymen.

first citizen.
peace there! hear the [[noble]] antony.

second citizen.
we’ll hear him, we’ll [[follow]] him, we’ll [[die]] with him.

antony.
good [[friends]], sweet [[friends]], let me not stir you up
to such a sudden flood of mutiny.
they that have done this deed are honourable.
what private griefs they have, alas, i [[know]] not,
that made them do it. they’re [[wise]] and honourable,
and will, no [[doubt]], with reasons [[reason]] [[answer]] you.
i come not, [[friends]], to steal away your hearts [[heart]].
i am no orator, as brutus is;
but, as you [[know]] me all, a plain blunt [[man]],
that [[love]] my friend; and that they [[know]] full well
that gave me [[public]] leave to speak of him.
for i have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
action, nor utterance, nor the [[power]] of [[speech]],
to stir [[men’s]] [[blood]]. i only speak [[right]] on.
i tell you that which you yourselves do [[know]],
show you sweet caesar’s wounds, [[poor]] poor dumb mouths,
and bid them speak for me. but were i brutus,
and brutus antony, there were an antony
would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
in every wound of caesar, that should move
the stones of [[rome]] to rise and mutiny.

citizens.
we’ll mutiny.

first citizen.
we’ll burn the house of brutus.

third citizen.
away, then! come, seek the conspirators.

antony.
yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.

citizens.
peace, ho! hear antony; most [[noble]] antony.

antony.
why, [[friends]], you go to do you [[know]] not what.
wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves [[love]]?
alas, you [[know]] not; i must tell you then.
you have forgot the will i told you of.

citizens.
most true; the will!—let’s stay, and hear the will.

antony.
here is the will, and under caesar’s seal.
to every roman citizen he gives,
to every several [[man]], seventy-five drachmas.

second citizen.
most [[noble]] caesar! we’ll [[revenge]] his [[death]].

third citizen.
o, [[royal]] caesar!

antony.
hear me with patience.

citizens.
peace, ho!

antony.
moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
his private arbors, and new-planted orchards,
on this side tiber; he hath left them you,
and to your heirs forever; [[common]] pleasures [[pleasure]],
to walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
here was a caesar! when comes such another?

first citizen.
never, never. come, away, away!
we’ll burn his [[body]] in the holy place,
and with the brands [[fire]] the traitors’ houses.
take up the [[body]].

second citizen.
go, fetch [[fire]].

third citizen.
pluck down benches.

fourth citizen.
pluck down forms, windows, anything.

 [_exeunt [[citizens]], with the [[body]]._]

antony.
now let it [[work]]. mischief, thou art [[arts]] afoot,
take thou what course thou wilt!

 enter a servant.

how now, fellow?

servant.
sir, octavius is already come to [[rome]].

antony.
where is he?

servant.
he and lepidus are at caesar’s house.

antony.
and thither will i straight to visit him.
he comes upon a [[wish]]. [[fortune]] is merry,
and in this mood will give us anything.

servant.
i heard him say brutus and cassius
are rid like madmen through the gates of [[rome]].

antony.
belike they had some notice of the [[people]],
how i had moved them. bring me to octavius.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. the same. a street.

 enter cinna, the poet, and after him the [[citizens]].

cinna.
i dreamt tonight that i did feast with caesar,
and things unluckily charge my fantasy.
i have no will to wander forth of doors,
yet something leads me forth.

first citizen.
what is your name?

second citizen.
whither are you going?

third citizen.
where do you dwell?

fourth citizen.
are you a [[married]] [[man]] or a bachelor?

second citizen.
answer every [[man]] directly.

first citizen.
ay, and briefly.

fourth citizen.
ay, and wisely.

third citizen.
ay, and truly, you were [[best]].

cinna.
what is my name? whither am i going? where do i dwell? am i a married
man or a bachelor? then, to [[answer]] every [[man]] directly and briefly,
wisely and truly. wisely i say i am a bachelor.

second citizen.
that’s as much as to say they are fools [[fool]] that [[marry]]; you’ll bear me a
bang for that, i [[fear]]. proceed, directly.

cinna.
directly, i am going to caesar’s [[funeral]].

first citizen.
as a friend, or an [[enemy]]?

cinna.
as a friend.

second citizen.
that matter is answered directly.

fourth citizen.
for your dwelling, briefly.

cinna.
briefly, i dwell by the capitol.

third citizen.
your name, sir, truly.

cinna.
truly, my name is cinna.

first citizen.
tear him to pieces! he’s a conspirator.

cinna.
i am cinna the poet, i am cinna the poet.

fourth citizen.
tear him for his [[bad]] verses, tear him for his [[bad]] verses.

cinna.
i am not cinna the conspirator.

fourth citizen.
it is no matter, his name’s cinna; pluck but his name out of his [[heart]],
and turn him going.

third citizen.
tear him, tear him! come; brands, ho! firebrands. to brutus’, to
cassius’; burn all. some to decius’ house, and some to casca’s, some to
ligarius’. away, go!

 [_exeunt._]



act iv

scene i. [[rome]]. a room in antony’s house.

 enter antony, octavius and lepidus, seated at a table.

antony.
these many then shall [[die]]; their names are prick’d.

octavius.
your [[brother]] too must [[die]]; [[consent]] you, lepidus?

lepidus.
i do [[consent]],—

octavius.
prick him down, antony.

lepidus.
upon condition publius shall not [[live]],
who is your sister’s [[son]], mark antony.

antony.
he shall not [[live]]; look, with a spot i damn him.
but, lepidus, go you to caesar’s house;
fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
how to cut off some charge in legacies.

lepidus.
what, shall i find you here?

octavius.
or here, or at the capitol.

 [_exit lepidus._]

antony.
this is a slight unmeritable [[man]],
meet to be sent on errands. is it fit,
the three-fold [[world]] divided, he should stand
one of the three to share it?

octavius.
so you [[thought]] him,
and took his voice who should be prick’d to die
in our black sentence and proscription.

antony.
octavius, i have seen more days than you;
and though we lay these honours [[honour]] on this [[man]],
to ease ourselves of divers sland’rous loads,
he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
to groan and sweat under the [[business]],
either [[led]] or driven, as we point the way;
and having brought our treasure where we will,
then take we down his load, and turn him off,
like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
and graze in commons [[common]].

octavius.
you may do your will;
but he’s a tried and valiant soldier.

antony.
so is my horse, octavius; and for that
i do appoint him store of provender.
it is a creature that i [[teach]] to [[fight]],
to wind, to stop, to run directly on,
his corporal motion govern’d by my spirit.
and, in some taste, is lepidus but so:
he must be taught, and train’d, and bid go forth:
a barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
on objects, [[arts]], and imitations,
which, out of use and stal’d by other [[men]],
begin his [[fashion]]. do not talk of him
but as a [[property]]. and now, octavius,
listen [[great]] things. brutus and cassius
are levying powers [[power]]; we must straight make head.
therefore let our [[alliance]] be combin’d,
our [[best]] [[friends]] made, our means stretch’d;
and let us presently go sit in council,
how covert matters may be [[best]] disclos’d,
and open perils surest answered.

octavius.
let us do so: for we are at the stake,
and bay’d about with many enemies [[enemy]];
and some that smile have in their hearts [[heart]], i [[fear]],
millions of mischiefs.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. before brutus’ tent, in the camp near sardis.

 drum. enter  brutus, lucilius, titinius and soldiers; pindarus meeting
 them; lucius at some distance.

brutus.
stand, ho!

lucilius.
give the word, ho! and stand.

brutus.
what now, lucilius! is cassius near?

lucilius.
he is at hand, and pindarus is come
to do you salutation from his master.

 [_pindarus gives a letter to brutus._]

brutus.
he greets me well. your master, pindarus,
in his own [[change]], or by ill officers,
hath given me some worthy cause to wish
things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
i shall be satisfied.

pindarus.
i do not doubt
but that my [[noble]] master will appear
such as he is, full of regard and [[honour]].

brutus.
he is not doubted. a word, lucilius;
how he received you, let me be resolv’d.

lucilius.
with courtesy and with [[respect]] enough,
but not with such familiar instances,
nor with such [[free]] and friendly conference,
as he hath us’d of old.

brutus.
thou hast describ’d
a hot friend cooling. ever note, lucilius,
when [[love]] begins to sicken and decay
it useth an enforced [[ceremony]].
there are no tricks in plain and simple [[faith]];
but hollow [[men]], like horses hot at hand,
make gallant show and promise of their mettle;

 [_low march within._]

but when they should endure the bloody spur,
they fall their crests, and like deceitful jades
sink in the [[trial]]. comes his [[army]] on?

lucilius.
they meant this night in sardis to be quarter’d;
the greater part, the horse in general,
are come with cassius.

 enter cassius and soldiers.

brutus.
hark! he is arriv’d.
march gently on to meet him.

cassius.
stand, ho!

brutus.
stand, ho! speak the word along.

first soldier.
stand!

second soldier.
stand!

third soldier.
stand!

cassius.
most [[noble]] [[brother]], you have done me [[wrong]].

brutus.
judge me, you gods; [[wrong]] i mine enemies [[enemy]]?
and if not so, how should i [[wrong]] a [[brother]]?

cassius.
brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs [[wrong]];
and when you do them—

brutus.
cassius, be content.
speak your griefs softly, i do [[know]] you well.
before the [[eyes]] of both our armies [[army]] here,
which should perceive nothing but [[love]] from us,
let us not wrangle. bid them move away;
then in my tent, cassius, enlarge your griefs,
and i will give you audience.

cassius.
pindarus,
bid our commanders lead their charges off
a little from this ground.

brutus.
lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
come to our tent till we have done our conference.
lucius and titinius, guard our door.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. within the tent of brutus.

 enter brutus and cassius.

cassius.
that you have wrong’d me doth appear in this:
you have condemn’d and noted lucius pella
for taking bribes here of the sardians;
wherein my letters, praying on his side
because i knew the [[man]], were slighted off.

brutus.
you wrong’d yourself to write in such a case.

cassius.
in such a [[time]] as this it is not meet
that every nice offence should bear his comment.

brutus.
let me tell you, cassius, you yourself
are much condemn’d to have an itching palm,
to sell and mart your offices for gold
to undeservers.

cassius.
i an itching palm!
you [[know]] that you are brutus that speak this,
or, by the gods, this [[speech]] were else your [[last]].

brutus.
the name of cassius honours [[honour]] this [[corruption]],
and chastisement doth therefore hide his head.

cassius.
chastisement!

brutus.
remember march, the ides of march [[remember]]:
did not [[great]] julius bleed for justice’ sake?
what villain touch’d his [[body]], that did stab,
and not for [[justice]]? what! shall one of us,
that struck the foremost [[man]] of all this world
but for supporting robbers, shall we now
contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
and sell the mighty space of our large honours
for so much trash as may be grasped thus?
i had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
than such a roman.

cassius.
brutus, bait not me,
i’ll not endure it. you forget yourself,
to hedge me in. i am a soldier, i,
older in practice, abler than yourself
to make conditions.

brutus.
go to; you are not, cassius.

cassius.
i am.

brutus.
i say you are not.

cassius.
urge me no more, i shall forget myself;
have [[mind]] upon your health, tempt me no farther.

brutus.
away, slight man!

cassius.
is’t possible?

brutus.
hear me, for i will speak.
must i give way and room to your rash choler?
shall i be frighted when a madman stares?

cassius.
o ye gods, ye gods! must i endure all this?

brutus.
all this? ay, more: fret till your proud [[heart]] break;
go show your slaves [[slave]] how choleric you are,
and make your bondmen tremble. must i budge?
must i observe you? must i stand and crouch
under your testy [[humour]]? by the gods,
you shall digest the venom of your spleen,
though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
i’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
when you are waspish.

cassius.
is it come to this?

brutus.
you say you are a [[better]] soldier:
let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
and it shall please me well. for mine own part,
i shall be glad to learn of [[noble]] [[men]].

cassius.
you [[wrong]] me every way, you [[wrong]] me, brutus.
i said, an elder soldier, not a [[better]]:
did i say [[better]]?

brutus.
if you did, i [[care]] not.

cassius.
when caesar liv’d, he durst not thus have mov’d me.

brutus.
peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.

cassius.
i durst not?

brutus.
no.

cassius.
what? durst not tempt him?

brutus.
for your [[life]] you durst not.

cassius.
do not presume too much upon my [[love]].
i may do that i shall be [[sorry]] for.

brutus.
you have done that you should be [[sorry]] for.
there is no terror, cassius, in your threats,
for i am arm’d so [[strong]] in honesty,
that they pass by me as the idle wind,
which i [[respect]] not. i did send to you
for [[certain]] sums of gold, which you denied me;
for i can raise no [[money]] by vile means:
by [[heaven]], i had rather coin my [[heart]],
and drop my [[blood]] for drachmas, than to wring
from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
by any indirection. i did send
to you for gold to [[pay]] my legions,
which you denied me: was that done like cassius?
should i have answer’d caius cassius so?
when marcus brutus grows so covetous,
to lock such rascal counters from his [[friends]],
be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
dash him to pieces!

cassius.
i denied you not.

brutus.
you did.

cassius.
i did not. he was but a fool
that brought my [[answer]] back. brutus hath riv’d my [[heart]].
a friend should bear his friend’s infirmities;
but brutus makes mine greater than they are.

brutus.
i do not, till you practise them on me.

cassius.
you [[love]] me not.

brutus.
i do not like your faults [[fault]].

cassius.
a friendly eye could never see such faults [[fault]].

brutus.
a flatterer’s would not, though they do appear
as huge as high [[olympus]].

cassius.
come, antony, and [[young]] octavius, come,
revenge yourselves alone on cassius,
for cassius is a-weary of the [[world]]:
hated by one he loves [[love]]; brav’d by his [[brother]];
check’d like a bondman; all his faults [[fault]] observ’d,
set in a note-book, learn’d and conn’d by rote,
to cast into my teeth. o, i could weep
my spirit from mine eyes! there is my dagger,
and here my naked breast; within, a heart
dearer than plutus’ mine, richer than gold:
if that thou be’st a roman, take it forth.
i, that denied thee gold, will give my [[heart]]:
strike as thou didst at caesar; for i [[know]],
when thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
than ever thou lovedst cassius.

brutus.
sheathe your dagger.
be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
do what you will, dishonour shall be [[humour]].
o cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
that carries anger as the flint bears [[fire]],
who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
and straight is cold again.

cassius.
hath cassius liv’d
to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus,
when [[grief]] and [[blood]] ill-temper’d vexeth him?

brutus.
when i spoke that, i was ill-temper’d too.

cassius.
do you confess so much? give me your hand.

brutus.
and my [[heart]] too.

cassius.
o brutus!

brutus.
what’s the matter?

cassius.
have not you [[love]] enough to bear with me,
when that rash [[humour]] which my [[mother]] gave me
makes me forgetful?

brutus.
yes, cassius; and from henceforth,
when you are over-earnest with your brutus,
he’ll [[think]] your [[mother]] chides, and leave you so.

 enter poet, followed by lucilius, titinius and lucius.

poet.
[_within._] let me go in to see the generals,
there is some grudge between ’em; ’tis not meet
they be alone.

lucilius.
[_within._] you shall not come to them.

poet.
[_within._] nothing but [[death]] shall stay me.

cassius.
how now! what’s the matter?

poet.
for shame, you generals! what do you mean?
love, and be [[friends]], as two such [[men]] should be;
for i have seen more years, i’m sure, than ye.

cassius.
ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!

brutus.
get you hence, sirrah. saucy fellow, hence!

cassius.
bear with him, brutus; ’tis his [[fashion]].

brutus.
i’ll [[know]] his [[humour]] when he knows [[know]] his [[time]].
what should the wars [[war]] do with these jigging fools [[fool]]?
companion, hence!

cassius.
away, away, be gone!

 [_exit poet._]

brutus.
lucilius and titinius, bid the commanders
prepare to lodge their companies tonight.

cassius.
and come yourselves and bring messala with you
immediately to us.

 [_exeunt lucilius and titinius._]

brutus.
lucius, a bowl of wine.

 [_exit lucius._]

cassius.
i did not [[think]] you could have been so angry.

brutus.
o cassius, i am sick of many griefs.

cassius.
of your [[philosophy]] you make no use,
if you give place to accidental evils [[evil]].

brutus.
no [[man]] bears [[sorrow]] [[better]]. portia is [[dead]].

cassius.
ha? portia?

brutus.
she is [[dead]].

cassius.
how ’scap’d i killing, when i cross’d you so?
o insupportable and touching loss!
upon what sickness?

brutus.
impatient of my absence,
and [[grief]] that [[young]] octavius with mark antony
have made themselves so [[strong]]; for with her death
that tidings came. with this she fell distract,
and, her attendants absent, swallow’d [[fire]].

cassius.
and died so?

brutus.
even so.

cassius.
o ye [[immortal]] gods!

 enter lucius, with wine and a taper.

brutus.
speak no more of her. give me a bowl of wine.
in this i bury all unkindness, cassius.

 [_drinks._]

cassius.
my [[heart]] is thirsty for that [[noble]] pledge.
fill, lucius, till the wine o’erswell the cup.
i cannot drink too much of brutus’ [[love]].

 [_drinks._]

 [_exit lucius._]

 enter titinius and messala.

brutus.
come in, titinius!
welcome, [[good]] messala.
now sit we close about this taper here,
and call in [[question]] our necessities.

cassius.
portia, art [[arts]] thou gone?

brutus.
no more, i [[pray]] you.
messala, i have here received letters,
that [[young]] octavius and mark antony
come down upon us with a mighty [[power]],
bending their expedition toward philippi.

messala.
myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.

brutus.
with what addition?

messala.
that by proscription and bills of outlawry
octavius, antony, and lepidus
have put to [[death]] an hundred senators.

brutus.
therein our letters do not well agree.
mine speak of seventy senators that died
by their proscriptions, cicero being one.

cassius.
cicero one!

messala.
cicero is [[dead]],
and by that order of proscription.
had you your letters from your [[wife]], my [[lord]]?

brutus.
no, messala.

messala.
nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

brutus.
nothing, messala.

messala.
that, methinks, is [[strange]].

brutus.
why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?

messala.
no, my [[lord]].

brutus.
now as you are a roman, tell me true.

messala.
then like a roman bear the [[truth]] i tell,
for [[certain]] she is [[dead]], and by [[strange]] manner.

brutus.
why, farewell, portia. we must [[die]], messala.
with meditating that she must [[die]] once,
i have the patience to endure it now.

messala.
even so [[great]] [[men]] [[great]] losses should endure.

cassius.
i have as much of this in art [[arts]] as you,
but yet my [[nature]] could not bear it so.

brutus.
well, to our [[work]] alive. what do you think
of marching to philippi presently?

cassius.
i do not [[think]] it [[good]].

brutus.
your [[reason]]?

cassius.
this it is:
’tis [[better]] that the [[enemy]] seek us;
so shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
doing himself offence, whilst we, lying still,
are full of rest, defence, and nimbleness.

brutus.
good reasons [[reason]] must of [[force]] give place to [[better]].
the [[people]] ’twixt philippi and this ground
do stand but in a forced affection;
for they have grudg’d us contribution.
the [[enemy]], marching along by them,
by them shall make a fuller number up,
come on refresh’d, new-added, and encourag’d;
from which advantage shall we cut him off
if at philippi we do face him there,
these [[people]] at our back.

cassius.
hear me, [[good]] [[brother]].

brutus.
under your pardon. you must note besides,
that we have tried the utmost of our [[friends]],
our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.
the [[enemy]] increaseth every day;
we, at the height, are ready to decline.
there is a tide in the affairs of [[men]],
which, taken at the flood, leads on to [[fortune]];
omitted, all the [[voyage]] of their life
is bound in shallows and in miseries.
on such a full sea are we now afloat,
and we must take the current when it serves,
or lose our ventures.

cassius.
then, with your will, go on:
we’ll along ourselves, and meet them at philippi.

brutus.
the deep of night is crept upon our talk,
and [[nature]] must obey necessity,
which we will niggard with a little rest.
there is no more to say?

cassius.
no more. [[good]] night:
early tomorrow will we rise, and hence.

 enter lucius.

brutus.
lucius! my gown.

 [_exit lucius._]

farewell now, [[good]] messala.
good night, titinius. [[noble]], [[noble]] cassius,
good night, and [[good]] repose.

cassius.
o my dear brother!
this was an ill beginning of the night.
never come such division ’tween our souls!
let it not, brutus.

 enter lucius with the gown.

brutus.
everything is well.

cassius.
good night, my [[lord]].

brutus.
good night, [[good]] [[brother]].

titinius and messala.
good night, [[lord]] brutus.

brutus.
farewell, everyone.

 [_exeunt cassius, titinius and messala._]

give me the gown. where is thy instrument?

lucius.
here in the tent.

brutus.
what, thou speak’st drowsily?
poor knave, i blame thee not, thou art [[arts]] o’er-watch’d.
call claudius and some other of my [[men]];
i’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

lucius.
varro and claudius!

 enter varro and claudius.

varro.
calls my [[lord]]?

brutus.
i [[pray]] you, sirs, [[lie]] in my tent and sleep;
it may be i shall raise you by-and-by
on [[business]] to my [[brother]] cassius.

varro.
so please you, we will stand and watch your [[pleasure]].

brutus.
i will not have it so; [[lie]] down, [[good]] sirs,
it may be i shall otherwise bethink me.
look, lucius, here’s the [[book]] i sought for so;
i put it in the pocket of my gown.

 [_servants [[lie]] down._]

lucius.
i was sure your lordship did not give it me.

brutus.
bear with me, [[good]] boy, i am much forgetful.
canst thou hold up thy heavy [[eyes]] awhile,
and touch thy instrument a strain or two?

lucius.
ay, my [[lord]], an’t please you.

brutus.
it does, my boy.
i trouble thee too much, but thou art [[arts]] willing.

lucius.
it is my [[duty]], sir.

brutus.
i should not urge thy [[duty]] [[past]] thy might;
i [[know]] [[young]] bloods look for a [[time]] of rest.

lucius.
i have slept, my [[lord]], already.

brutus.
it was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
i will not hold thee long. if i do [[live]],
i will be [[good]] to thee.

 [_lucius plays and sings till he falls asleep._]

this is a sleepy tune. o murd’rous slumber,
layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
that plays thee [[music]]? gentle knave, [[good]] night;
i will not do thee so much [[wrong]] to wake thee.
if thou dost nod, thou break’st thy instrument;
i’ll take it from thee; and, [[good]] boy, [[good]] night.
let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn’d down
where i left reading? here it is, i [[think]].

 enter the ghost of caesar.

how ill this taper burns! ha! who comes here?
i [[think]] it is the weakness of mine eyes
that shapes this monstrous apparition.
it comes upon me. art [[arts]] thou anything?
art thou some [[god]], some angel, or some [[devil]],
that mak’st my [[blood]] cold and my hair to stare?
speak to me what thou art [[arts]].

ghost.
thy [[evil]] spirit, brutus.

brutus.
why com’st thou?

ghost.
to tell thee thou shalt see me at philippi.

brutus.
well; then i shall see thee again?

ghost.
ay, at philippi.

brutus.
why, i will see thee at philippi then.

 [_ghost vanishes._]

now i have taken [[heart]], thou vanishest.
ill spirit, i would hold more talk with thee.
boy! lucius! varro! claudius! sirs, awake! claudius!

lucius.
the strings, my [[lord]], are false.

brutus.
he thinks [[think]] he still is at his instrument.
lucius, awake!

lucius.
my [[lord]]?

brutus.
didst thou [[dream]], lucius, that thou so criedst out?

lucius.
my [[lord]], i do not [[know]] that i did cry.

brutus.
yes, that thou didst. didst thou see anything?

lucius.
nothing, my [[lord]].

brutus.
sleep again, lucius. sirrah claudius!
fellow thou, awake!

varro.
my [[lord]]?

claudius.
my [[lord]]?

brutus.
why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

varro. claudius.
did we, my [[lord]]?

brutus.
ay. saw you anything?

varro.
no, my [[lord]], i saw nothing.

claudius.
nor i, my [[lord]].

brutus.
go and commend me to my [[brother]] cassius;
bid him set on his powers [[power]] betimes before,
and we will [[follow]].

varro. claudius.
it shall be done, my [[lord]].

 [_exeunt._]



act v

scene i. the plains of philippi.

 enter octavius, antony and their [[army]].

octavius.
now, antony, our hopes [[hope]] are answered.
you said the [[enemy]] would not come down,
but keep the hills and upper regions.
it proves not so; their battles [[battle]] are at hand,
they mean to warn us at philippi here,
answering before we do demand of them.

antony.
tut, i am in their bosoms, and i know
wherefore they do it. they could be content
to visit other places, and come down
with fearful bravery, thinking by this face
to fasten in our thoughts [[thought]] that they have [[courage]];
but ’tis not so.

 enter a messenger.

messenger.
prepare you, generals.
the [[enemy]] comes on in gallant show;
their bloody sign of [[battle]] is hung out,
and something to be done immediately.

antony.
octavius, lead your [[battle]] softly on
upon the left hand of the even field.

octavius.
upon the [[right]] hand i. keep thou the left.

antony.
why do you cross me in this exigent?

octavius.
i do not cross you; but i will do so.

 [_march._]

drum. enter brutus, cassius and their [[army]]; lucilius, titinius, messala
and others.

brutus.
they stand, and would have parley.

cassius.
stand fast, titinius; we must out and talk.

octavius.
mark antony, shall we give sign of [[battle]]?

antony.
no, caesar, we will [[answer]] on their charge.
make forth; the generals would have some words.

octavius.
stir not until the signal.

brutus.
words before blows: is it so, countrymen?

octavius.
not that we [[love]] words [[better]], as you do.

brutus.
good words are [[better]] than [[bad]] strokes, octavius.

antony.
in your [[bad]] strokes, brutus, you give [[good]] words;
witness the hole you made in caesar’s [[heart]],
crying, “long live! hail, caesar!”

cassius.
antony,
the posture of your blows are yet unknown;
but for your words, they rob the hybla bees,
and leave them honeyless.

antony.
not stingless too.

brutus.
o yes, and soundless too,
for you have stol’n their buzzing, antony,
and very wisely threat before you sting.

antony.
villains, you did not so when your vile daggers
hack’d one another in the sides of caesar:
you show’d your teeth like apes, and fawn’d like hounds,
and bow’d like bondmen, kissing caesar’s feet;
whilst damned casca, like a cur, behind
struck caesar on the neck. o you flatterers!

cassius.
flatterers! now, brutus, thank yourself.
this tongue had not offended so today,
if cassius might have rul’d.

octavius.
come, come, the cause. if arguing makes us sweat,
the proof of it will turn to redder drops.
look, i draw a [[sword]] against conspirators.
when [[think]] you that the [[sword]] goes up again?
never, till caesar’s three and thirty wounds
be well aveng’d; or till another caesar
have added slaughter to the [[sword]] of traitors.

brutus.
caesar, thou canst not [[die]] by traitors’ hands,
unless thou bring’st them with thee.

octavius.
so i [[hope]].
i was not born to [[die]] on brutus’ [[sword]].

brutus.
o, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
young [[man]], thou couldst not [[die]] more honourable.

cassius.
a peevish school-boy, worthless of such [[honour]],
join’d with a masker and a reveller.

antony.
old cassius still!

octavius.
come, antony; away!
defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
if you dare [[fight]] today, come to the field;
if not, when you have stomachs.

 [_exeunt octavius, antony and their [[army]]._]

cassius.
why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!
the storm is up, and all is on the hazard.

brutus.
ho, lucilius! hark, a word with you.

lucilius.
my [[lord]]?

 [_brutus and lucilius talk apart._]

cassius.
messala.

messala.
what says my general?

cassius.
messala,
this is my birth-day; as this very day
was cassius born. give me thy hand, messala:
be thou my witness that against my will
as pompey was, am i compell’d to set
upon one [[battle]] all our liberties [[liberty]].
you [[know]] that i held epicurus [[strong]],
and his [[opinion]]. now i [[change]] my [[mind]],
and partly credit things that do presage.
coming from sardis, on our former ensign
two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch’d,
gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands,
who to philippi here consorted us.
this morning are they fled away and gone,
and in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites
fly o’er our heads, and downward look on us,
as we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
a canopy most fatal, under which
our [[army]] lies [[lie]], ready to give up the ghost.

messala.
believe not so.

cassius.
i but [[believe]] it partly,
for i am fresh of spirit, and resolv’d
to meet all perils very constantly.

brutus.
even so, lucilius.

cassius.
now, most [[noble]] brutus,
the gods today stand friendly, that we may,
lovers in [[peace]], lead on our days to age!
but, since the affairs of [[men]] rest still incertain,
let’s [[reason]] with the worst that may befall.
if we do lose this [[battle]], then is this
the very [[last]] [[time]] we shall speak together:
what are you then determined to do?

brutus.
even by the [[rule]] of that philosophy
by which i did blame cato for the death
which he did give himself, i [[know]] not how,
but i do find it cowardly and vile,
for [[fear]] of what might fall, so to prevent
the [[time]] of [[life]], arming myself with patience
to stay the providence of some high powers
that govern us below.

cassius.
then, if we lose this [[battle]],
you are contented to be [[led]] in triumph
thorough the streets of [[rome]]?

brutus.
no, cassius, no: [[think]] not, thou [[noble]] roman,
that ever brutus will go bound to [[rome]];
he bears too [[great]] a [[mind]]. but this same day
must end that [[work]] the ides of march begun;
and whether we shall meet again i [[know]] not.
therefore our everlasting farewell take.
for ever, and for ever, farewell, cassius.
if we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
if not, why then this parting was well made.

cassius.
for ever and for ever farewell, brutus.
if we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed;
if not, ’tis true this parting was well made.

brutus.
why then, lead on. o, that a [[man]] might know
the end of this day’s [[business]] ere it come!
but it sufficeth that the day will end,
and then the end is known. come, ho! away!

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. the same. the field of [[battle]].

 alarum. enter brutus and messala.

brutus.
ride, ride, messala, ride, and give these bills
unto the legions on the other side.

 [_loud alarum._]

let them set on at once; for i perceive
but cold demeanor in octavius’ wing,
and sudden push gives them the overthrow.
ride, ride, messala; let them all come down.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. another part of the field.

 alarum. enter cassius and titinius.

cassius.
o, look, titinius, look, the villains fly!
myself have to mine own turn’d [[enemy]]:
this ensign here of mine was turning back;
i slew the [[coward]], and did take it from him.

titinius.
o cassius, brutus gave the word too early,
who, having some advantage on octavius,
took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
whilst we by antony are all enclos’d.

 enter pindarus.

pindarus.
fly further off, my [[lord]], fly further off;
mark antony is in your tents, my [[lord]].
fly, therefore, [[noble]] cassius, fly far off.

cassius.
this hill is far enough. look, look, titinius;
are those my tents where i perceive the [[fire]]?

titinius.
they are, my [[lord]].

cassius.
titinius, if thou lovest me,
mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,
till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
and here again, that i may rest assur’d
whether yond [[troops]] are friend or [[enemy]].

titinius.
i will be here again, even with a [[thought]].

 [_exit._]

cassius.
go, pindarus, get higher on that hill,
my sight was ever thick. regard titinius,
and tell me what thou notest about the field.

 [_pindarus goes up._]

this day i breathed first. [[time]] is come round,
and where i did begin, there shall i end.
my [[life]] is run his compass. sirrah, what news?

pindarus.
[_above._] o my lord!

cassius.
what news?

pindarus.
[_above._] titinius is enclosed round about
with horsemen, that make to him on the spur,
yet he spurs on. now they are almost on him.
now, titinius! now some [[light]]. o, he lights [[light]] too.
he’s ta’en!

 [_shout._]

and, hark! they shout for joy.

cassius.
come down; behold no more.
o, [[coward]] that i am, to [[live]] so long,
to see my [[best]] friend ta’en before my face!

 [_pindarus descends._]

come hither, sirrah.
in parthia did i take thee [[prisoner]];
and then i swore thee, saving of thy [[life]],
that whatsoever i did bid thee do,
thou shouldst attempt it. come now, keep thine oath.
now be a freeman; and with this [[good]] [[sword]],
that ran through caesar’s bowels, search this bosom.
stand not to [[answer]]. here, take thou the hilts;
and when my face is cover’d, as ’tis now,
guide thou the [[sword]].—caesar, thou art [[arts]] reveng’d,
even with the [[sword]] that kill’d thee.

 [_dies._]

pindarus.
so, i am [[free]], yet would not so have been,
durst i have done my will. o cassius!
far from this [[country]] pindarus shall run,
where never roman shall take note of him.

 [_exit._]

 enter titinius with messala.

messala.
it is but [[change]], titinius; for octavius
is overthrown by [[noble]] brutus’ [[power]],
as cassius’ legions are by antony.

titinius.
these tidings would well comfort cassius.

messala.
where did you leave him?

titinius.
all disconsolate,
with pindarus his bondman, on this hill.

messala.
is not that he that lies [[lie]] upon the ground?

titinius.
he lies [[lie]] not like the living. o my heart!

messala.
is not that he?

titinius.
no, this was he, messala,
but cassius is no more. o setting sun,
as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,
so in his red [[blood]] cassius’ day is set.
the sun of [[rome]] is set. our day is gone;
clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done.
mistrust of my [[success]] hath done this deed.

messala.
mistrust of [[good]] [[success]] hath done this deed.
o hateful error, melancholy’s child!
why dost thou show to the apt thoughts [[thought]] of men
the things that are not? o error, soon conceiv’d,
thou never com’st unto a [[happy]] birth,
but kill’st the [[mother]] that engender’d thee!

titinius.
what, pindarus! where art [[arts]] thou, pindarus?

messala.
seek him, titinius, whilst i go to meet
the [[noble]] brutus, thrusting this report
into his ears. i may say thrusting it;
for piercing steel and darts envenomed
shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus
as tidings of this sight.

titinius.
hie you, messala,
and i will seek for pindarus the while.

 [_exit messala._]

why didst thou send me forth, brave cassius?
did i not meet thy [[friends]]? and did not they
put on my brows this wreath of [[victory]],
and bid me give it thee? didst thou not hear their shouts?
alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
but, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
thy brutus bid me give it thee, and i
will do his bidding. brutus, come apace,
and see how i regarded caius cassius.
by your leave, gods. this is a roman’s part.
come, cassius’ [[sword]], and find titinius’ [[heart]].

 [_dies._]

 alarum. enter brutus, messala, [[young]] cato, strato, volumnius and
 lucilius.

brutus.
where, where, messala, doth his [[body]] [[lie]]?

messala.
lo, yonder, and titinius mourning it.

brutus.
titinius’ face is upward.

cato.
he is slain.

brutus.
o julius caesar, thou art [[arts]] mighty yet!
thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords
in our own proper entrails.

 [_low alarums._]

cato.
brave titinius!
look whether he have not crown’d [[dead]] cassius!

brutus.
are yet two romans living such as these?
the [[last]] of all the romans, fare thee well!
it is impossible that ever rome
should breed thy fellow. [[friends]], i owe more tears
to this [[dead]] [[man]] than you shall see me [[pay]].
i shall find [[time]], cassius, i shall find [[time]].
come therefore, and to thassos send his [[body]].
his funerals shall not be in our camp,
lest it discomfort us. lucilius, come;
and come, [[young]] cato; let us to the field.
labeo and flavius, set our battles [[battle]] on.
’tis three o’clock; and romans, yet ere night
we shall try [[fortune]] in a second [[fight]].

 [_exeunt._]

scene iv. another part of the field.

 alarum. enter fighting soldiers of both armies [[army]]; then brutus, messala,
 [[young]] cato, lucilius, flavius and others.

brutus.
yet, countrymen, o, yet hold up your heads!

cato.
what bastard doth not? who will go with me?
i will proclaim my name about the field.
i am the [[son]] of marcus cato, ho!
a foe to tyrants [[tyrant]], and my country’s friend.
i am the [[son]] of marcus cato, ho!

 [_charges the [[enemy]]._]

lucilius.
and i am brutus, marcus brutus, i;
brutus, my country’s friend; [[know]] me for brutus!

 [_exit, charging the [[enemy]]. cato is overpowered, and falls._]

lucilius.
o [[young]] and [[noble]] cato, art [[arts]] thou down?
why, now thou diest as bravely as titinius,
and mayst be honour’d, being cato’s [[son]].

first soldier.
yield, or thou diest.

lucilius.
only i yield to [[die]]:
there is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;

 [_offering money_]

kill brutus, and be honour’d in his [[death]].

first soldier.
we must not. a [[noble]] prisoner!

second soldier.
room, ho! tell antony, brutus is ta’en.

first soldier.
i’ll tell the news. here comes the general.

 enter antony.

brutus is ta’en, brutus is ta’en, my [[lord]].

antony.
where is he?

lucilius.
safe, antony; brutus is safe enough.
i dare assure thee that no enemy
shall ever take alive the [[noble]] brutus.
the gods defend him from so [[great]] a shame!
when you do find him, or alive or [[dead]],
he will be found like brutus, like himself.

antony.
this is not brutus, friend; but, i assure you,
a prize no less in worth. keep this [[man]] safe,
give him all [[kindness]]. i had rather have
such [[men]] my [[friends]] than enemies [[enemy]]. go on,
and see whether brutus be alive or [[dead]];
and bring us word unto octavius’ tent
how everything is chanc’d.

 [_exeunt._]

scene v. another part of the field.

 enter brutus, dardanius, clitus, strato and volumnius.

brutus.
come, [[poor]] remains of [[friends]], rest on this rock.

clitus.
statilius show’d the torch-light; but, my [[lord]],
he came not back: he is or ta’en or slain.

brutus.
sit thee down, clitus. slaying is the word;
it is a deed in [[fashion]]. hark thee, clitus.

 [_whispering._]

clitus.
what, i, my [[lord]]? no, not for all the [[world]].

brutus.
peace then, no words.

clitus.
i’ll rather kill myself.

brutus.
hark thee, dardanius.

 [_whispers him._]

dardanius.
shall i do such a deed?

clitus.
o dardanius!

dardanius.
o clitus!

clitus.
what ill request did brutus make to thee?

dardanius.
to kill him, clitus. look, he meditates.

clitus.
now is that [[noble]] vessel full of [[grief]],
that it runs over even at his [[eyes]].

brutus.
come hither, [[good]] volumnius; list a word.

volumnius.
what says my [[lord]]?

brutus.
why, this, volumnius:
the ghost of caesar hath appear’d to me
two several times [[time]] by night; at sardis once,
and this [[last]] night here in philippi fields.
i [[know]] my hour is come.

volumnius.
not so, my [[lord]].

brutus.
nay i am sure it is, volumnius.
thou seest the [[world]], volumnius, how it goes;
our enemies [[enemy]] have beat us to the pit.

 [_low alarums._]

it is more worthy to leap in ourselves
than tarry till they push us. [[good]] volumnius,
thou know’st that we two went to school together;
even for that our [[love]] of old, i pr’ythee
hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst i run on it.

volumnius.
that’s not an office for a friend, my [[lord]].

 [_alarums still._]

clitus.
fly, fly, my lord! there is no tarrying here.

brutus.
farewell to you; and you; and you, volumnius.
strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
farewell to thee too, strato.—countrymen,
my [[heart]] doth joy, that yet in all my life
i found no [[man]] but he was true to me.
i shall have [[glory]] by this losing day
more than octavius and mark antony
by this vile [[conquest]] shall attain unto.
so fare you well at once; for brutus’ tongue
hath almost ended his life’s [[history]].
night hangs upon mine [[eyes]]; my bones would rest,
that have but labour’d to attain this hour.

 [_alarums. cry within, “fly, fly, fly!”._]

clitus.
fly, my [[lord]], fly!

brutus.
hence! i will [[follow]].

 [_exeunt clitus, dardanius and volumnius._]

i pr’ythee, strato, stay thou by thy [[lord]].
thou art [[arts]] a fellow of a [[good]] [[respect]];
thy [[life]] hath had some smatch of [[honour]] in it.
hold then my [[sword]], and turn away thy face,
while i do run upon it. wilt thou, strato?

strato.
give me your hand first. fare you well, my [[lord]].

brutus.
farewell, [[good]] strato.—caesar, now be still:
i kill’d not thee with half so [[good]] a will.

 [_he runs on his [[sword]], and dies._]

 alarum. retreat. enter antony, octavius, messala, lucilius and the
 [[army]].

octavius.
what [[man]] is that?

messala.
my master’s [[man]]. strato, where is thy master?

strato.
free from the bondage you are in, messala.
the conquerors can but make a [[fire]] of him;
for brutus only overcame himself,
and no [[man]] else hath [[honour]] by his [[death]].

lucilius.
so brutus should be found. i thank thee, brutus,
that thou hast prov’d lucilius’ saying true.

octavius.
all that serv’d brutus, i will entertain them.
fellow, wilt thou bestow thy [[time]] with me?

strato.
ay, if messala will prefer me to you.

octavius.
do so, [[good]] messala.

messala.
how died my master, strato?

strato.
i held the [[sword]], and he did run on it.

messala.
octavius, then take him to [[follow]] thee,
that did the latest service to my master.

antony.
this was the noblest roman of them all.
all the conspirators save only he,
did that they did in envy of [[great]] caesar;
he only, in a general honest thought
and [[common]] [[good]] to all, made one of them.
his [[life]] was gentle, and the elements
so mix’d in him that [[nature]] might stand up
and say to all the [[world]], “this was a man!”

octavius.
according to his [[virtue]] let us use him
with all [[respect]] and rites of burial.
within my tent his bones tonight shall [[lie]],
most like a soldier, order’d honourably.
so call the field to rest, and let’s away,
to part the glories of this [[happy]] day.
