the prologue

 enter chorus.

chorus.
two households, both alike in [[dignity]],
in [[fair]] verona, where we lay our scene,
from ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
where civil [[blood]] makes civil hands unclean.
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
a pair of star-cross’d lovers take their [[life]];
whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
doth with their [[death]] bury their parents’ strife.
the fearful passage of their death-mark’d [[love]],
and the continuance of their parents’ rage,
which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
the which, if you with patient ears attend,
what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

 [_exit._]



act i

scene i. a [[public]] place.

 enter sampson and gregory armed with swords [[sword]] and bucklers.

sampson.
gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.

gregory.
no, for then we should be colliers.

sampson.
i mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.

gregory.
ay, while you [[live]], draw your neck out o’ the collar.

sampson.
i strike quickly, being moved.

gregory.
but thou art [[arts]] not quickly moved to strike.

sampson.
a dog of the house of montague moves me.

gregory.
to move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou
art moved, thou runn’st away.

sampson.
a dog of that house shall move me to stand.
i will take the wall of any [[man]] or maid of montague’s.

gregory.
that shows thee a [[weak]] [[slave]], for the weakest goes to the wall.

sampson.
true, and therefore [[women]], being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to
the wall: therefore i will push montague’s [[men]] from the wall, and
thrust his maids to the wall.

gregory.
the quarrel is between our masters and us their [[men]].

sampson.
’tis all one, i will show myself a [[tyrant]]: when i have fought with the
men i will be civil with the maids, i will cut off their heads.

gregory.
the heads of the maids?

sampson.
ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
thou wilt.

gregory.
they must take it in sense that [[feel]] it.

sampson.
me they shall [[feel]] while i am able to stand: and ’tis known i am a
pretty piece of flesh.

gregory.
’tis well thou art [[arts]] not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been [[poor]] john.
draw thy tool; here comes of the house of montagues.

 enter abram and balthasar.

sampson.
my naked weapon is out: quarrel, i will back thee.

gregory.
how? turn thy back and run?

sampson.
fear me not.

gregory.
no, [[marry]]; i [[fear]] thee!

sampson.
let us take the [[law]] of our sides; let them begin.

gregory.
i will frown as i pass by, and let them take it as they list.

sampson.
nay, as they dare. i will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to
them if they bear it.

abram.
do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

sampson.
i do bite my thumb, sir.

abram.
do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

sampson.
is the [[law]] of our side if i say ay?

gregory.
no.

sampson.
no sir, i do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but i bite my thumb, sir.

gregory.
do you quarrel, sir?

abram.
quarrel, sir? no, sir.

sampson.
but if you do, sir, am for you. i serve as [[good]] a [[man]] as you.

abram.
no [[better]].

sampson.
well, sir.

 enter benvolio.

gregory.
say [[better]]; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.

sampson.
yes, [[better]], sir.

abram.
you [[lie]].

sampson.
draw, if you be [[men]]. gregory, [[remember]] thy washing blow.

 [_they [[fight]]._]

benvolio.
part, fools! put up your swords [[sword]], you [[know]] not what you do.

 [_beats down their swords [[sword]]._]

 enter tybalt.

tybalt.
what, art [[arts]] thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
turn thee benvolio, look upon thy [[death]].

benvolio.
i do but keep the [[peace]], put up thy [[sword]],
or manage it to part these [[men]] with me.

tybalt.
what, drawn, and talk of [[peace]]? i hate the word
as i hate hell, all montagues, and thee:
have at thee, [[coward]].

 [_they [[fight]]._]

 enter three or four [[citizens]] with clubs.

first citizen.
clubs, bills and partisans! strike! beat them down!
down with the capulets! down with the montagues!

 enter capulet in his gown, and [[lady]] capulet.

capulet.
what noise is this? give me my long [[sword]], ho!

lady capulet.
a crutch, a crutch! why call you for a [[sword]]?

capulet.
my [[sword]], i say! old montague is come,
and flourishes his blade in spite of me.

 enter montague and his [[lady]] montague.

montague.
thou villain capulet! hold me not, let me go.

lady montague.
thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.

 enter [[prince]] escalus, with attendants.

prince.
rebellious subjects [[subject]], enemies [[enemy]] to [[peace]],
profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
will they not hear? what, ho! you [[men]], you beasts,
that quench the [[fire]] of your pernicious rage
with purple fountains issuing from your veins,
on [[pain]] of torture, from those bloody hands
throw your mistemper’d [[weapons]] to the ground
and hear the sentence of your moved [[prince]].
three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
by thee, old capulet, and montague,
have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,
and made verona’s ancient citizens
cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
to wield old partisans, in hands as old,
canker’d with [[peace]], to part your canker’d hate.
if ever you disturb our streets again,
your lives [[life]] shall [[pay]] the forfeit of the [[peace]].
for this [[time]] all the rest depart away:
you, capulet, shall go along with me,
and montague, come you this afternoon,
to [[know]] our farther [[pleasure]] in this case,
to old free-town, our [[common]] judgement-place.
once more, on [[pain]] of [[death]], all [[men]] depart.

 [_exeunt [[prince]] and attendants; capulet, [[lady]] capulet, tybalt,
 [[citizens]] and servants._]

montague.
who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

benvolio.
here were the servants of your adversary
and yours, close fighting ere i did approach.
i drew to part them, in the instant came
the fiery tybalt, with his [[sword]] prepar’d,
which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,
he swung about his head, and cut the winds,
who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows
came more and more, and fought on part and part,
till the [[prince]] came, who parted either part.

lady montague.
o where is romeo, saw you him today?
right glad i am he was not at this fray.

benvolio.
madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun
peer’d forth the golden window of the east,
a troubled [[mind]] drave me to walk abroad,
where underneath the grove of sycamore
that westward rooteth from this [[city]] side,
so early walking did i see your [[son]].
towards him i made, but he was ware of me,
and stole into the covert of the wood.
i, measuring his affections by my own,
which then most sought where most might not be found,
being one too many by my weary [[self]],
pursu’d my [[humour]], not pursuing his,
and gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.

montague.
many a morning hath he there been seen,
with tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
but all so soon as the all-cheering sun
should in the farthest east begin to draw
the shady curtains from aurora’s bed,
away from [[light]] steals [[home]] my heavy [[son]],
and private in his chamber pens himself,
shuts up his windows, locks [[fair]] daylight out
and makes himself an artificial night.
black and portentous must this [[humour]] prove,
unless [[good]] counsel may the cause remove.

benvolio.
my [[noble]] uncle, do you [[know]] the cause?

montague.
i neither [[know]] it nor can learn of him.

benvolio.
have you importun’d him by any means?

montague.
both by myself and many other [[friends]];
but he, his own affections’ counsellor,
is to himself—i will not say how true—
but to himself so secret and so close,
so far from sounding and discovery,
as is the bud bit with an envious worm
ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
or dedicate his [[beauty]] to the sun.
could we but learn from whence his sorrows [[sorrow]] grow,
we would as willingly give cure as [[know]].

 enter romeo.

benvolio.
see, where he comes. so please you step aside;
i’ll [[know]] his grievance or be much denied.

montague.
i would thou wert so [[happy]] by thy stay
to hear true shrift. come, madam, let’s away,

 [_exeunt montague and [[lady]] montague._]

benvolio.
good morrow, cousin.

romeo.
is the day so [[young]]?

benvolio.
but new struck nine.

romeo.
ay me, [[sad]] hours seem long.
was that my [[father]] that went hence so fast?

benvolio.
it was. what sadness lengthens romeo’s hours?

romeo.
not having that which, having, makes them short.

benvolio.
in [[love]]?

romeo.
out.

benvolio.
of [[love]]?

romeo.
out of her favour where i am in [[love]].

benvolio.
alas that [[love]] so gentle in his view,
should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.

romeo.
alas that [[love]], whose view is muffled still,
should, without [[eyes]], see pathways to his will!
where shall we dine? o me! what fray was here?
yet tell me not, for i have heard it all.
here’s much to do with hate, but more with [[love]]:
why, then, o brawling love! o loving hate!
o anything, of nothing first create!
o heavy lightness! serious vanity!
misshapen [[chaos]] of well-seeming forms!
feather of lead, bright smoke, cold [[fire]], sick health!
still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
this [[love]] [[feel]] i, that [[feel]] no [[love]] in this.
dost thou not laugh?

benvolio.
no coz, i rather weep.

romeo.
good [[heart]], at what?

benvolio.
at thy [[good]] heart’s oppression.

romeo.
why such is love’s transgression.
griefs of mine own [[lie]] heavy in my breast,
which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
with more of thine. this [[love]] that thou hast shown
doth add more [[grief]] to too much of mine own.
love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
being purg’d, a [[fire]] sparkling in lovers’ [[eyes]];
being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:
what is it else? a madness most discreet,
a choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
farewell, my coz.

 [_going._]

benvolio.
soft! i will go along:
and if you leave me so, you do me [[wrong]].

romeo.
tut! i have lost myself; i am not here.
this is not romeo, he’s some other where.

benvolio.
tell me in sadness who is that you [[love]]?

romeo.
what, shall i groan and tell thee?

benvolio.
groan! why, no; but sadly tell me who.

romeo.
bid a sick [[man]] in sadness make his will,
a word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.
in sadness, cousin, i do [[love]] a woman.

benvolio.
i aim’d so near when i suppos’d you lov’d.

romeo.
a [[right]] [[good]] markman, and she’s [[fair]] i [[love]].

benvolio.
a [[right]] [[fair]] mark, [[fair]] coz, is soonest hit.

romeo.
well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit
with cupid’s arrow, she hath dian’s wit;
and in [[strong]] proof of chastity well arm’d,
from love’s [[weak]] childish bow she lives [[life]] uncharm’d.
she will not stay the siege of loving terms
nor bide th’encounter of assailing [[eyes]],
nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
o she’s [[rich]] in [[beauty]], only poor
that when she dies, with [[beauty]] dies her store.

benvolio.
then she hath sworn that she will still [[live]] chaste?

romeo.
she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
for [[beauty]] starv’d with her severity,
cuts [[beauty]] off from all [[posterity]].
she is too [[fair]], too [[wise]]; wisely too [[fair]],
to [[merit]] bliss by making me despair.
she hath forsworn to [[love]], and in that vow
do i [[live]] [[dead]], that [[live]] to tell it now.

benvolio.
be rul’d by me, forget to [[think]] of her.

romeo.
o [[teach]] me how i should forget to [[think]].

benvolio.
by giving [[liberty]] unto thine [[eyes]];
examine other beauties [[beauty]].

romeo.
’tis the way
to call hers, exquisite, in [[question]] more.
these [[happy]] masks that kiss [[fair]] ladies’ brows,
being black, puts us in [[mind]] they hide the [[fair]];
he that is strucken blind cannot forget
the precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
show me a mistress that is passing [[fair]],
what doth her [[beauty]] serve but as a note
where i may [[read]] who pass’d that passing [[fair]]?
farewell, thou canst not [[teach]] me to forget.

benvolio.
i’ll [[pay]] that doctrine, or else [[die]] in debt.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. a street.

 enter capulet, [[paris]] and servant.

capulet.
but montague is bound as well as i,
in penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, i [[think]],
for [[men]] so old as we to keep the [[peace]].

paris.
of honourable reckoning are you both,
and [[pity]] ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.
but now my [[lord]], what say you to my suit?

capulet.
but saying o’er what i have said before.
my child is yet a stranger in the [[world]],
she hath not seen the [[change]] of fourteen years;
let two more summers wither in their pride
ere we may [[think]] her ripe to be a bride.

paris.
younger than she are [[happy]] mothers [[mother]] made.

capulet.
and too soon marr’d are those so early made.
the [[earth]] hath swallowed all my hopes [[hope]] but she,
she is the hopeful [[lady]] of my [[earth]]:
but woo her, gentle [[paris]], get her [[heart]],
my will to her [[consent]] is but a part;
and she agree, within her scope of choice
lies my [[consent]] and [[fair]] according voice.
this night i hold an old accustom’d feast,
whereto i have invited many a guest,
such as i [[love]], and you among the store,
one more, most welcome, makes my number more.
at my [[poor]] house look to behold this night
earth-treading stars that make dark [[heaven]] [[light]]:
such comfort as do lusty [[young]] [[men]] feel
when well apparell’d april on the heel
of limping winter treads, even such delight
among fresh female buds shall you this night
inherit at my house. hear all, all see,
and like her most whose [[merit]] most shall be:
which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
may stand in number, though in reckoning none.
come, go with me. go, sirrah, trudge about
through [[fair]] verona; find those persons [[person]] out
whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,
my house and welcome on their [[pleasure]] stay.

 [_exeunt capulet and [[paris]]._]

servant.
find them out whose names are written here! it is written that the
shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his [[last]], the
fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but i am sent to
find those persons [[person]] whose names are here writ, and can never find what
names the writing [[person]] hath here writ. i must to the learned. in good
time!

 enter benvolio and romeo.

benvolio.
tut, [[man]], one [[fire]] burns out another’s burning,
one [[pain]] is lessen’d by another’s anguish;
turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
one desperate [[grief]] cures with another’s languish:
take thou some new infection to thy eye,
and the rank poison of the old will [[die]].

romeo.
your plantain leaf is excellent for that.

benvolio.
for what, i [[pray]] thee?

romeo.
for your broken shin.

benvolio.
why, romeo, art [[arts]] thou mad?

romeo.
not mad, but bound more than a madman is:
shut up in prison, kept without my food,
whipp’d and tormented and—god-den, [[good]] fellow.

servant.
god gi’ go-den. i [[pray]], sir, can you [[read]]?

romeo.
ay, mine own [[fortune]] in my misery.

servant.
perhaps you have learned it without [[book]].
but i [[pray]], can you [[read]] anything you see?

romeo.
ay, if i [[know]] the letters and the [[language]].

servant.
ye say honestly, rest you merry!

romeo.
stay, fellow; i can [[read]].

 [_he reads the letter._]

_signior martino and his [[wife]] and daughters [[daughter]];
county anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
the [[lady]] widow of utruvio;
signior placentio and his lovely nieces;
mercutio and his [[brother]] valentine;
mine uncle capulet, his [[wife]], and daughters [[daughter]];
my [[fair]] niece rosaline and livia;
signior valentio and his cousin tybalt;
lucio and the lively helena. _


a [[fair]] assembly. [_gives back the paper_] whither should they come?

servant.
up.

romeo.
whither to supper?

servant.
to our house.

romeo.
whose house?

servant.
my master’s.

romeo.
indeed i should have ask’d you that before.

servant.
now i’ll tell you without asking. my master is the [[great]] [[rich]] capulet,
and if you be not of the house of montagues, i [[pray]] come and crush a
cup of wine. rest you merry.

 [_exit._]

benvolio.
at this same ancient feast of capulet’s
sups the [[fair]] rosaline whom thou so lov’st;
with all the admired beauties [[beauty]] of verona.
go thither and with unattainted eye,
compare her face with some that i shall show,
and i will make thee [[think]] thy swan a crow.

romeo.
when the devout [[religion]] of mine eye
maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to [[fire]];
and these who, often drown’d, could never [[die]],
transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.
one fairer than my [[love]]? the all-seeing sun
ne’er saw her match since first the [[world]] begun.

benvolio.
tut, you saw her [[fair]], none else being by,
herself pois’d with herself in either eye:
but in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d
your lady’s [[love]] against some other maid
that i will show you shining at this feast,
and she shall scant show well that now shows [[best]].

romeo.
i’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,
but to rejoice in splendour of my own.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. room in capulet’s house.

 enter [[lady]] capulet and nurse.

lady capulet.
nurse, where’s my [[daughter]]? call her forth to me.

nurse.
now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
i bade her come. what, lamb! what ladybird!
god forbid! where’s this girl? what, juliet!

 enter juliet.

juliet.
how now, who calls?

nurse.
your [[mother]].

juliet.
madam, i am here. what is your will?

lady capulet.
this is the matter. nurse, give leave awhile,
we must talk in secret. nurse, come back again,
i have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.
thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty [[age]].

nurse.
faith, i can tell her [[age]] unto an hour.

lady capulet.
she’s not fourteen.

nurse.
i’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,
and yet, to my teen be it spoken, i have but four,
she is not fourteen. how long is it now
to lammas-tide?

lady capulet.
a fortnight and odd days.

nurse.
even or odd, of all days in the year,
come lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen.
susan and she,—god rest all [[christian]] souls!—
were of an [[age]]. well, susan is with [[god]];
she was too [[good]] for me. but as i said,
on lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen;
that shall she, [[marry]]; i [[remember]] it well.
’tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
and she was wean’d,—i never shall forget it—,
of all the days of the year, upon that day:
for i had then laid wormwood to my dug,
sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;
my [[lord]] and you were then at mantua:
nay, i do bear a brain. but as i said,
when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
of my dug and [[felt]] it bitter, pretty [[fool]],
to see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, i trow,
to bid me trudge.
and since that [[time]] it is eleven years;
for then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood
she could have run and waddled all about;
for even the day before she broke her brow,
and then my husband,—god be with his soul!
a was a merry [[man]],—took up the child:
‘yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?
thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
wilt thou not, jule?’ and, by my holidame,
the pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘ay’.
to see now how a jest shall come about.
i warrant, and i should [[live]] a thousand years,
i never should forget it. ‘wilt thou not, jule?’ quoth he;
and, pretty [[fool]], it stinted, and said ‘ay.’

lady capulet.
enough of this; i [[pray]] thee hold thy [[peace]].

nurse.
yes, madam, yet i cannot choose but laugh,
to [[think]] it should leave crying, and say ‘ay’;
and yet i warrant it had upon it brow
a bump as big as a [[young]] cockerel’s stone;
a perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
‘yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?
thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to [[age]];
wilt thou not, jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘ay’.

juliet.
and stint thou too, i [[pray]] thee, nurse, say i.

nurse.
peace, i have done. [[god]] mark thee to his grace
thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er i nurs’d:
and i might [[live]] to see thee [[married]] once, i have my [[wish]].

lady capulet.
marry, that [[marry]] is the very theme
i came to talk of. tell me, [[daughter]] juliet,
how stands your disposition to be [[married]]?

juliet.
it is an [[honour]] that i [[dream]] not of.

nurse.
an honour! were not i thine only nurse,
i would say thou hadst suck’d [[wisdom]] from thy teat.

lady capulet.
well, [[think]] of [[marriage]] now: younger than you,
here in verona, ladies [[lady]] of esteem,
are made already mothers [[mother]]. by my count
i was your [[mother]] much upon these years
that you are now a maid. thus, then, in brief;
the valiant [[paris]] seeks you for his [[love]].

nurse.
a [[man]], [[young]] lady! [[lady]], such a man
as all the world—why he’s a [[man]] of wax.

lady capulet.
verona’s summer hath not such a flower.

nurse.
nay, he’s a flower, in [[faith]] a very flower.

lady capulet.
what say you, can you [[love]] the gentleman?
this night you shall behold him at our feast;
read o’er the volume of [[young]] paris’ face,
and find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.
examine every [[married]] lineament,
and see how one another lends content;
and what obscur’d in this [[fair]] volume lies [[lie]],
find written in the margent of his [[eyes]].
this precious [[book]] of [[love]], this unbound lover,
to beautify him, only lacks a cover:
the fish lives [[life]] in the sea; and ’tis much pride
for [[fair]] without the [[fair]] within to hide.
that [[book]] in many’s [[eyes]] doth share the [[glory]],
that in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
so shall you share all that he doth possess,
by having him, making yourself no less.

nurse.
no less, nay bigger. [[women]] grow by [[men]].

lady capulet.
speak briefly, can you like of paris’ [[love]]?

juliet.
i’ll look to like, if looking liking move:
but no more deep will i endart mine eye
than your [[consent]] gives [[strength]] to make it fly.

 enter a servant.

servant.
madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my [[young]] lady
asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.
i must hence to wait, i beseech you [[follow]] straight.

lady capulet.
we [[follow]] thee.

 [_exit servant._]

juliet, the county stays.

nurse.
go, girl, seek [[happy]] nights to [[happy]] days.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iv. a street.

 enter romeo, mercutio, benvolio, with five or six maskers;
 torch-bearers and others.

romeo.
what, shall this [[speech]] be spoke for our excuse?
or shall we on without apology?

benvolio.
the date is out of such prolixity:
we’ll have no cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,
bearing a tartar’s painted bow of lath,
scaring the ladies [[lady]] like a crow-keeper;
nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
after the prompter, for our entrance:
but let them measure us by what they will,
we’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.

romeo.
give me a torch, i am not for this ambling;
being but heavy i will bear the [[light]].

mercutio.
nay, gentle romeo, we must have you dance.

romeo.
not i, [[believe]] me, you have dancing shoes,
with nimble soles, i have a [[soul]] of lead
so stakes me to the ground i cannot move.

mercutio.
you are a lover, borrow cupid’s wings,
and soar with them above a [[common]] bound.

romeo.
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
to soar with his [[light]] feathers, and so bound,
i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
under love’s heavy burden do i sink.

mercutio.
and, to sink in it, should you burden [[love]];
too [[great]] oppression for a tender thing.

romeo.
is [[love]] a tender thing? it is too rough,
too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.

mercutio.
if [[love]] be rough with you, be rough with [[love]];
prick [[love]] for pricking, and you beat [[love]] down.
give me a case to put my visage in: [_putting on a mask._]
a visor for a visor. what [[care]] i
what [[curious]] eye doth quote deformities?
here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.

benvolio.
come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
but every [[man]] betake him to his legs.

romeo.
a torch for me: let wantons, [[light]] of [[heart]],
tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
for i am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,
i’ll be a candle-holder and look on,
the game was ne’er so [[fair]], and i am done.

mercutio.
tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:
if thou art [[arts]] dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire
or save your reverence [[love]], wherein thou stickest
up to the ears. come, we burn daylight, ho.

romeo.
nay, that’s not so.

mercutio.
i mean sir, in delay
we waste our lights [[light]] in [[vain]], [[light]] lights [[light]] by day.
take our [[good]] meaning, for our [[judgment]] sits
five times [[time]] in that ere once in our five wits.

romeo.
and we mean well in going to this mask;
but ’tis no wit to go.

mercutio.
why, may one ask?

romeo.
i dreamt a [[dream]] tonight.

mercutio.
and so did i.

romeo.
well what was yours?

mercutio.
that dreamers often [[lie]].

romeo.
in bed asleep, while they do [[dream]] things true.

mercutio.
o, then, i see queen mab hath been with you.
she is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes
in shape no bigger than an agate-stone
on the fore-finger of an alderman,
drawn with a team of little atomies
over [[men’s]] noses as they [[lie]] asleep:
her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;
the cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;
the collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;
her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;
her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
not half so big as a round little worm
prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:
her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
time out o’ [[mind]] the fairies’ coachmakers.
and in this [[state]] she gallops night by night
through lovers’ brains, and then they [[dream]] of [[love]];
o’er courtiers’ knees, that [[dream]] on curtsies straight;
o’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight [[dream]] on fees;
o’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses [[dream]],
which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues,
because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
and then dreams [[dream]] he of smelling out a suit;
and sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
tickling a parson’s nose as a lies [[lie]] asleep,
then dreams [[dream]] he of another benefice:
sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
and then dreams [[dream]] he of cutting [[foreign]] throats,
of breaches, ambuscados, spanish blades,
of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
and, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
and sleeps again. this is that very mab
that plats the manes of horses in the night;
and bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
this is the hag, when maids [[lie]] on their backs,
that presses them, and learns them first to bear,
making them [[women]] of [[good]] carriage:
this is she,—

romeo.
peace, [[peace]], mercutio, [[peace]],
thou talk’st of nothing.

mercutio.
true, i talk of dreams [[dream]],
which are the [[children]] of an idle brain,
begot of nothing but [[vain]] fantasy,
which is as thin of substance as the air,
and more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
even now the frozen bosom of the north,
and, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,
turning his side to the dew-dropping south.

benvolio.
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
supper is done, and we shall come too late.

romeo.
i [[fear]] too early: for my [[mind]] misgives
some consequence yet hanging in the stars,
shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night’s revels; and expire the term
of a despised [[life]], clos’d in my breast
by some vile forfeit of untimely [[death]].
but he that hath the steerage of my course
direct my suit. on, lusty gentlemen!

benvolio.
strike, drum.

scene v. a hall in capulet’s house.

 musicians waiting. enter servants.

first servant.
where’s potpan, that he helps not to take away?
he shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!

second servant.
when [[good]] manners shall [[lie]] all in one or two [[men’s]] hands, and they
unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing.

first servant.
away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the
plate. [[good]] thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves [[love]] me,
let the porter let in susan grindstone and nell. antony and potpan!

second servant.
ay, boy, ready.

first servant.
you are looked for and called for, [[asked]] for and sought for, in the
great chamber.

second servant.
we cannot be here and there too. cheerly, boys. be brisk awhile, and
the longer liver take all.

 [_exeunt._]

 enter capulet, &c. with the guests and gentlewomen to the maskers.

capulet.
welcome, gentlemen, ladies [[lady]] that have their toes
unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you.
ah my mistresses, which of you all
will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
she i’ll swear hath corns. am i come near ye now?
welcome, gentlemen! i have seen the day
that i have worn a visor, and could tell
a whispering tale in a [[fair]] lady’s ear,
such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,
you are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
a hall, a hall, give room! and foot it, girls.

 [_music plays, and they dance._]

more [[light]], you knaves; and turn the tables up,
and quench the [[fire]], the room is grown too hot.
ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for [[sport]] comes well.
nay sit, nay sit, [[good]] cousin capulet,
for you and i are [[past]] our dancing days;
how long is’t now since [[last]] yourself and i
were in a mask?

capulet’s cousin.
by’r [[lady]], thirty years.

capulet.
what, [[man]], ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:
’tis since the nuptial of lucentio,
come pentecost as quickly as it will,
some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.

capulet’s cousin.
’tis more, ’tis more, his [[son]] is elder, sir;
his [[son]] is thirty.

capulet.
will you tell me that?
his [[son]] was but a ward two years ago.

romeo.
what [[lady]] is that, which doth enrich the hand
of yonder knight?

servant.
i [[know]] not, sir.

romeo.
o, she doth [[teach]] the torches to burn bright!
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
as a [[rich]] jewel in an ethiop’s ear;
beauty too [[rich]] for use, for [[earth]] too dear!
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
as yonder [[lady]] o’er her fellows shows.
the measure done, i’ll watch her place of stand,
and touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
did my [[heart]] [[love]] till now? forswear it, sight!
for i ne’er saw true [[beauty]] till this night.

tybalt.
this by his voice, should be a montague.
fetch me my rapier, boy. what, dares the slave
come hither, cover’d with an antic face,
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
now by the stock and [[honour]] of my kin,
to strike him [[dead]] i hold it not a [[sin]].

capulet.
why how now, kinsman!
wherefore storm you so?

tybalt.
uncle, this is a montague, our foe;
a villain that is hither come in spite,
to scorn at our solemnity this night.

capulet.
young romeo, is it?

tybalt.
’tis he, that villain romeo.

capulet.
content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
a bears him like a portly gentleman;
and, to say [[truth]], verona brags of him
to be a [[virtuous]] and well-govern’d [[youth]].
i would not for the [[wealth]] of all the town
here in my house do him disparagement.
therefore be patient, take no note of him,
it is my will; the which if thou [[respect]],
show a [[fair]] presence and put off these frowns,
an ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

tybalt.
it fits when such a villain is a guest:
i’ll not endure him.

capulet.
he shall be endur’d.
what, goodman boy! i say he shall, go to;
am i the master here, or you? go to.
you’ll not endure him! [[god]] shall mend my [[soul]],
you’ll make a mutiny among my guests!
you will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!

tybalt.
why, uncle, ’tis a shame.

capulet.
go to, go to!
you are a saucy boy. is’t so, indeed?
this trick may [[chance]] to scathe you, i [[know]] what.
you must contrary me! [[marry]], ’tis [[time]].
well said, my hearts!—you are a princox; go:
be quiet, or—more [[light]], more light!—for shame!
i’ll make you quiet. what, cheerly, my hearts [[heart]].

tybalt.
patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
i will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.

 [_exit._]

romeo.
[_to juliet._] if i profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine, the gentle [[sin]] is this,
my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

juliet.
good pilgrim, you do [[wrong]] your hand too much,
which mannerly devotion shows in this;
for saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
and palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.

romeo.
have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

juliet.
ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

romeo.
o, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:
they [[pray]], grant thou, lest [[faith]] turn to despair.

juliet.
saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.

romeo.
then move not while my prayer’s effect i take.
thus from my lips, by thine my [[sin]] is purg’d.
[_kissing her._]

juliet.
then have my lips the [[sin]] that they have took.

romeo.
sin from my lips? o trespass sweetly urg’d!
give me my [[sin]] again.

juliet.
you kiss by the [[book]].

nurse.
madam, your [[mother]] craves a word with you.

romeo.
what is her [[mother]]?

nurse.
marry, bachelor,
her [[mother]] is the [[lady]] of the house,
and a [[good]] [[lady]], and a [[wise]] and [[virtuous]].
i nurs’d her [[daughter]] that you talk’d withal.
i tell you, he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks.

romeo.
is she a capulet?
o dear account! my [[life]] is my foe’s debt.

benvolio.
away, be gone; the [[sport]] is at the [[best]].

romeo.
ay, so i [[fear]]; the more is my unrest.

capulet.
nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,
we have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
is it e’en so? why then, i thank you all;
i thank you, honest gentlemen; [[good]] night.
more torches here! come on then, let’s to bed.
ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,
i’ll to my rest.

 [_exeunt all but juliet and nurse._]

juliet.
come hither, nurse. what is yond gentleman?

nurse.
the [[son]] and heir of old tiberio.

juliet.
what’s he that now is going out of door?

nurse.
marry, that i [[think]] be [[young]] petruchio.

juliet.
what’s he that follows here, that would not dance?

nurse.
i [[know]] not.

juliet.
go ask his name. if he be [[married]],
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

nurse.
his name is romeo, and a montague,
the only [[son]] of your [[great]] [[enemy]].

juliet.
my only [[love]] sprung from my only hate!
too early seen unknown, and known too late!
prodigious birth of [[love]] it is to me,
that i must [[love]] a loathed [[enemy]].

nurse.
what’s this? what’s this?

juliet.
a rhyme i learn’d even now
of one i danc’d withal.

 [_one calls within, ‘juliet’._]

nurse.
anon, anon!
come let’s away, the strangers all are gone.

act ii

 enter chorus.

chorus.
now old [[desire]] doth in his deathbed [[lie]],
and [[young]] affection gapes to be his heir;
that [[fair]] for which [[love]] groan’d for and would [[die]],
with tender juliet match’d, is now not [[fair]].
now romeo is belov’d, and loves [[love]] again,
alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
but to his foe suppos’d he must [[complain]],
and she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
being held a foe, he may not have access
to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
and she as much in [[love]], her means much less
to meet her new beloved anywhere.
but passion lends them [[power]], [[time]] means, to meet,
tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

scene i. an open place adjoining capulet’s garden.

 enter romeo.

romeo.
can i go forward when my [[heart]] is here?
turn back, dull [[earth]], and find thy centre out.

 [_he climbs the wall and leaps down within it._]

 enter benvolio and mercutio.

benvolio.
romeo! my cousin romeo! romeo!

mercutio.
he is [[wise]],
and on my [[life]] hath stol’n him [[home]] to bed.

benvolio.
he ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:
call, [[good]] mercutio.

mercutio.
nay, i’ll conjure too.
romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,
speak but one rhyme, and i am satisfied;
cry but ‘ah me!’ pronounce but [[love]] and dove;
speak to my gossip [[venus]] one [[fair]] word,
one nickname for her purblind [[son]] and heir,
young [[abraham]] cupid, he that shot so trim
when [[king]] cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.
he heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
the ape is [[dead]], and i must conjure him.
i conjure thee by rosaline’s bright [[eyes]],
by her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
by her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
and the demesnes that there adjacent [[lie]],
that in thy likeness thou appear to us.

benvolio.
an if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

mercutio.
this cannot anger him. ’twould anger him
to raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,
of some [[strange]] [[nature]], letting it there stand
till she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;
that were some spite. my invocation
is [[fair]] and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,
i conjure only but to raise up him.

benvolio.
come, he hath hid himself among these trees
to be consorted with the humorous night.
blind is his [[love]], and [[best]] befits the dark.

mercutio.
if [[love]] be blind, [[love]] cannot hit the mark.
now will he sit under a medlar tree,
and [[wish]] his mistress were that [[kind]] of fruit
as maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
o romeo, that she were, o that she were
an open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
romeo, [[good]] night. i’ll to my truckle-bed.
this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
come, shall we go?

benvolio.
go then; for ’tis in vain
to seek him here that means not to be found.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. capulet’s garden.

 enter romeo.

romeo.
he jests at scars that never [[felt]] a wound.

 juliet appears above at a window.

but soft, what [[light]] through yonder window breaks?
it is the east, and juliet is the sun!
arise [[fair]] sun and kill the envious moon,
who is already sick and pale with [[grief]],
that thou her maid art [[arts]] far more [[fair]] than she.
be not her maid since she is envious;
her vestal livery is but sick and green,
and none but fools [[fool]] do wear it; cast it off.
it is my [[lady]], o it is my love!
o, that she knew she were!
she speaks, yet she says nothing. what of that?
her eye discourses, i will [[answer]] it.
i am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.
two of the fairest stars in all the [[heaven]],
having some [[business]], do entreat her eyes
to twinkle in their spheres till they return.
what if her [[eyes]] were there, they in her head?
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
as daylight doth a lamp; her [[eyes]] in heaven
would through the airy region stream so bright
that birds would sing and [[think]] it were not night.
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
o that i were a glove upon that hand,
that i might touch that cheek.

juliet.
ay me.

romeo.
she speaks.
o speak again bright angel, for thou art
as glorious to this night, being o’er my head,
as is a winged messenger of heaven
unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
when he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds
and sails upon the bosom of the air.

juliet.
o romeo, romeo, wherefore art [[arts]] thou romeo?
deny thy [[father]] and refuse thy name.
or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my [[love]],
and i’ll no longer be a capulet.

romeo.
[_aside._] shall i hear more, or shall i speak at this?

juliet.
’tis but thy name that is my [[enemy]];
thou art [[arts]] thyself, though not a montague.
what’s montague? it is nor hand nor foot,
nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
belonging to a [[man]]. o be some other name.
what’s in a name? that which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet;
so romeo would, were he not romeo call’d,
retain that dear [[perfection]] which he owes
without that title. romeo, doff thy name,
and for thy name, which is no part of thee,
take all myself.

romeo.
i take thee at thy word.
call me but [[love]], and i’ll be new baptis’d;
henceforth i never will be romeo.

juliet.
what [[man]] art [[arts]] thou that, thus bescreen’d in night
so stumblest on my counsel?

romeo.
by a name
i [[know]] not how to tell thee who i am:
my name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
because it is an [[enemy]] to thee.
had i it written, i would tear the word.

juliet.
my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
of thy tongue’s utterance, yet i [[know]] the sound.
art thou not romeo, and a montague?

romeo.
neither, [[fair]] maid, if either thee dislike.

juliet.
how cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
and the place [[death]], considering who thou art [[arts]],
if any of my kinsmen find thee here.

romeo.
with love’s [[light]] wings did i o’erperch these walls,
for stony limits cannot hold [[love]] out,
and what [[love]] can do, that dares [[love]] attempt:
therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

juliet.
if they do see thee, they will murder thee.

romeo.
alack, there lies [[lie]] more peril in thine eye
than twenty of their swords [[sword]]. look thou but sweet,
and i am proof against their enmity.

juliet.
i would not for the [[world]] they saw thee here.

romeo.
i have night’s cloak to hide me from their [[eyes]],
and but thou [[love]] me, let them find me here.
my [[life]] were [[better]] ended by their hate
than [[death]] prorogued, wanting of thy [[love]].

juliet.
by whose direction found’st thou out this place?

romeo.
by [[love]], that first did prompt me to enquire;
he lent me counsel, and i lent him [[eyes]].
i am no pilot; yet wert thou as far
as that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,
i should adventure for such merchandise.

juliet.
thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
fain would i dwell on form, fain, fain deny
what i have spoke; but farewell compliment.
dost thou [[love]] me? i [[know]] thou wilt say ay,
and i will take thy word. yet, if thou swear’st,
thou mayst prove false. at lovers’ perjuries,
they say jove laughs. o gentle romeo,
if thou dost [[love]], pronounce it faithfully.
or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won,
i’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,
so thou wilt woo. but else, not for the [[world]].
in [[truth]], [[fair]] montague, i am too fond;
and therefore thou mayst [[think]] my ’haviour [[light]]:
but trust me, gentleman, i’ll prove more true
than those that have more cunning to be [[strange]].
i should have been more [[strange]], i must confess,
but that thou overheard’st, ere i was ’ware,
my true-love passion; therefore pardon me,
and not impute this yielding to [[light]] [[love]],
which the dark night hath so discovered.

romeo.
lady, by yonder blessed moon i vow,
that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—

juliet.
o swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,
that monthly changes [[change]] in her circled orb,
lest that thy [[love]] prove likewise variable.

romeo.
what shall i swear by?

juliet.
do not swear at all.
or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious [[self]],
which is the [[god]] of my idolatry,
and i’ll [[believe]] thee.

romeo.
if my heart’s dear [[love]],—

juliet.
well, do not swear. although i joy in thee,
i have no joy of this contract tonight;
it is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,
too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
ere one can say it lightens. sweet, [[good]] night.
this bud of [[love]], by summer’s ripening breath,
may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
good night, [[good]] night. as sweet repose and rest
come to thy [[heart]] as that within my breast.

romeo.
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

juliet.
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

romeo.
th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.

juliet.
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
and yet i would it were to give again.

romeo.
would’st thou withdraw it? for what [[purpose]], [[love]]?

juliet.
but to be frank and give it thee again.
and yet i [[wish]] but for the thing i have;
my bounty is as boundless as the sea,
my [[love]] as deep; the more i give to thee,
the more i have, for both are infinite.
i hear some noise within. dear [[love]], adieu.
[_nurse calls within._]
anon, [[good]] nurse!—sweet montague be true.
stay but a little, i will come again.

 [_exit._]

romeo.
o blessed, blessed night. i am afeard,
being in night, all this is but a [[dream]],
too flattering sweet to be substantial.

 enter juliet above.

juliet.
three words, dear romeo, and [[good]] night indeed.
if that thy bent of [[love]] be honourable,
thy [[purpose]] [[marriage]], send me word tomorrow,
by one that i’ll procure to come to thee,
where and what [[time]] thou wilt perform the rite,
and all my fortunes [[fortune]] at thy foot i’ll lay
and [[follow]] thee my [[lord]] throughout the [[world]].

nurse.
[_within._] madam.

juliet.
i come, anon.— but if thou meanest not well,
i do beseech thee,—

nurse.
[_within._] madam.

juliet.
by and by i come—
to cease thy strife and leave me to my [[grief]].
tomorrow will i send.

romeo.
so thrive my [[soul]],—

juliet.
a thousand times [[time]] [[good]] night.

 [_exit._]

romeo.
a thousand times [[time]] the worse, to want thy [[light]].
love goes toward [[love]] as schoolboys from their books [[book]],
but [[love]] from [[love]], towards school with heavy looks.

 [_retiring slowly._]

 re-enter juliet, above.

juliet.
hist! romeo, hist! o for a falconer’s voice
to lure this tassel-gentle back again.
bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
else would i tear the cave where echo lies [[lie]],
and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
with repetition of my romeo’s name.

romeo.
it is my [[soul]] that calls upon my name.
how silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,
like softest [[music]] to attending ears.

juliet.
romeo.

romeo.
my nyas?

juliet.
what o’clock tomorrow
shall i send to thee?

romeo.
by the hour of nine.

juliet.
i will not fail. ’tis twenty years till then.
i have forgot why i did call thee back.

romeo.
let me stand here till thou [[remember]] it.

juliet.
i shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
remembering how i [[love]] thy company.

romeo.
and i’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,
forgetting any other [[home]] but this.

juliet.
’tis almost morning; i would have thee gone,
and yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,
that lets it hop a little from her hand,
like a [[poor]] [[prisoner]] in his twisted gyves,
and with a silk thread plucks it back again,
so loving-jealous of his [[liberty]].

romeo.
i would i were thy bird.

juliet.
sweet, so would i:
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing.
good night, [[good]] night. parting is such sweet sorrow
that i shall say [[good]] night till it be morrow.

 [_exit._]

romeo.
sleep dwell upon thine [[eyes]], [[peace]] in thy breast.
would i were sleep and [[peace]], so sweet to rest.
the grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,
chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of [[light]];
and darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels
from forth day’s pathway, made by titan’s wheels
hence will i to my ghostly sire’s cell,
his [[help]] to crave and my dear hap to tell.

 [_exit._]

scene iii. friar lawrence’s cell.

 enter friar lawrence with a basket.

friar lawrence.
now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
the day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,
i must upfill this osier cage of ours
with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
the [[earth]] that’s nature’s [[mother]], is her tomb;
what is her burying grave, that is her womb:
and from her womb [[children]] of divers kind
we sucking on her [[natural]] bosom find.
many for many virtues [[virtue]] excellent,
none but for some, and yet all different.
o, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
for naught so vile that on the [[earth]] doth live
but to the [[earth]] some special [[good]] doth give;
nor aught so [[good]] but, strain’d from that [[fair]] use,

virtue itself turns [[vice]] being misapplied,

 enter romeo.

within the infant rind of this [[weak]] flower
poison hath residence, and medicine [[power]]:
for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
being tasted, slays all senses with the [[heart]].
two such opposed kings [[king]] encamp them still
in [[man]] as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;
and where the worser is predominant,
full soon the canker [[death]] eats up that plant.

romeo.
good morrow, [[father]].

friar lawrence.
benedicite!
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
young [[son]], it argues a distemper’d head
so soon to bid [[good]] morrow to thy bed.
care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,
and where [[care]] lodges sleep will never [[lie]];
but where unbruised [[youth]] with unstuff’d brain
doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
therefore thy earliness doth me assure
thou art [[arts]] uprous’d with some distemperature;
or if not so, then here i hit it [[right]],
our romeo hath not been in bed tonight.

romeo.
that [[last]] is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

friar lawrence.
god pardon [[sin]]. wast thou with rosaline?

romeo.
with rosaline, my ghostly [[father]]? no.
i have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.

friar lawrence.
that’s my [[good]] [[son]]. but where hast thou been then?

romeo.
i’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
i have been feasting with mine [[enemy]],
where on a sudden one hath wounded me
that’s by me wounded. both our remedies
within thy [[help]] and holy physic lies [[lie]].
i bear no [[hatred]], blessed [[man]]; for lo,
my intercession likewise steads my foe.

friar lawrence.
be plain, [[good]] [[son]], and homely in thy drift;
riddling [[confession]] finds but riddling shrift.

romeo.
then plainly [[know]] my heart’s dear [[love]] is set
on the [[fair]] [[daughter]] of [[rich]] capulet.
as mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
and all combin’d, save what thou must combine
by holy [[marriage]]. when, and where, and how
we met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,
i’ll tell thee as we pass; but this i [[pray]],
that thou [[consent]] to [[marry]] us today.

friar lawrence.
holy saint francis! what a [[change]] is here!
is rosaline, that thou didst [[love]] so dear,
so soon forsaken? [[young]] [[men’s]] [[love]] then lies
not truly in their hearts [[heart]], but in their [[eyes]].
jesu maria, what a deal of brine
hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for rosaline!
how much salt water thrown away in waste,
to season [[love]], that of it doth not taste.
the sun not yet thy sighs from [[heaven]] clears,
thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.
lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.
if ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
thou and these woes were all for rosaline,
and art [[arts]] thou chang’d? pronounce this sentence then,
women may fall, when there’s no [[strength]] in [[men]].

romeo.
thou chidd’st me oft for loving rosaline.

friar lawrence.
for doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

romeo.
and bad’st me bury [[love]].

friar lawrence.
not in a grave
to lay one in, another out to have.

romeo.
i [[pray]] thee chide me not, her i [[love]] now
doth grace for grace and [[love]] for [[love]] allow.
the other did not so.

friar lawrence.
o, she knew well
thy [[love]] did [[read]] by rote, that could not spell.
but come [[young]] waverer, come go with me,
in one [[respect]] i’ll thy assistant be;
for this [[alliance]] may so [[happy]] prove,
to turn your households’ rancour to pure [[love]].

romeo.
o let us hence; i stand on sudden haste.

friar lawrence.
wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

scene iv. a street.

 enter benvolio and mercutio.

mercutio.
where the [[devil]] should this romeo be? came he not [[home]] tonight?

benvolio.
not to his father’s; i spoke with his [[man]].

mercutio.
why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that rosaline, torments him so
that he will sure run mad.

benvolio.
tybalt, the kinsman to old capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s
house.

mercutio.
a challenge, on my [[life]].

benvolio.
romeo will [[answer]] it.

mercutio.
any [[man]] that can write may [[answer]] a letter.

benvolio.
nay, he will [[answer]] the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.

mercutio.
alas [[poor]] romeo, he is already [[dead]], stabbed with a [[white]] wench’s black
eye; run through the ear with a [[love]] [[song]], the very pin of his heart
cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. and is he a [[man]] to encounter
tybalt?

benvolio.
why, what is tybalt?

mercutio.
more than [[prince]] of cats. o, he’s the courageous captain of
compliments. he fights as you sing prick-song, keeps [[time]], distance,
and proportion. he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in
your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;
a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. ah,
the [[immortal]] passado, the punto reverso, the hay.

benvolio.
the what?

mercutio.
the pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners
of accent. by jesu, a very [[good]] blade, a very tall [[man]], a very good
whore. why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should
be thus afflicted with these [[strange]] flies, these fashion-mongers,
these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot
sit at ease on the old bench? o their bones, their bones!

 enter romeo.

benvolio.
here comes romeo, here comes romeo!

mercutio.
without his roe, like a dried herring. o flesh, flesh, how art [[arts]] thou
fishified! now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in. laura, to
his [[lady]], was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a [[better]] [[love]] to
berhyme her: dido a dowdy; cleopatra a gypsy; helen and hero hildings
and harlots; thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the [[purpose]]. signior
romeo, bonjour! there’s a french salutation to your french slop. you
gave us the counterfeit fairly [[last]] night.

romeo.
good morrow to you both. what counterfeit did i give you?

mercutio.
the slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

romeo.
pardon, [[good]] mercutio, my [[business]] was [[great]], and in such a case as
mine a [[man]] may strain courtesy.

mercutio.
that’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a [[man]] to bow
in the hams.

romeo.
meaning, to curtsy.

mercutio.
thou hast most kindly hit it.

romeo.
a most courteous exposition.

mercutio.
nay, i am the very pink of courtesy.

romeo.
pink for flower.

mercutio.
right.

romeo.
why, then is my pump well flowered.

mercutio.
sure wit, [[follow]] me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,
that when the [[single]] sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the
wearing, solely singular.

romeo.
o single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!

mercutio.
come between us, [[good]] benvolio; my wits faint.

romeo.
swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or i’ll cry a match.

mercutio.
nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, i am done. for thou hast
more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than i am sure, i have in my
whole five. was i with you there for the goose?

romeo.
thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the
goose.

mercutio.
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

romeo.
nay, [[good]] goose, bite not.

mercutio.
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.

romeo.
and is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?

mercutio.
o here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an
ell broad.

romeo.
i stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves
thee far and wide a broad goose.

mercutio.
why, is not this [[better]] now than groaning for [[love]]? now art [[arts]] thou
sociable, now art [[arts]] thou romeo; not art [[arts]] thou what thou art [[arts]], by art [[arts]] as
well as by [[nature]]. for this drivelling [[love]] is like a [[great]] [[natural]],
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

benvolio.
stop there, stop there.

mercutio.
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

benvolio.
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

mercutio.
o, thou art [[arts]] deceived; i would have made it short, for i was come to the
whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no
longer.

 enter nurse and peter.

romeo.
here’s goodly gear!
a sail, a sail!

mercutio.
two, two; a shirt and a smock.

nurse.
peter!

peter.
anon.

nurse.
my fan, peter.

mercutio.
good peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.

nurse.
god ye [[good]] morrow, gentlemen.

mercutio.
god ye good-den, [[fair]] gentlewoman.

nurse.
is it good-den?

mercutio.
’tis no less, i tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the
prick of noon.

nurse.
out upon you! what a [[man]] are you?

romeo.
one, gentlewoman, that [[god]] hath made for himself to mar.

nurse.
by my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? gentlemen,
can any of you tell me where i may find the [[young]] romeo?

romeo.
i can tell you: but [[young]] romeo will be older when you have found him
than he was when you sought him. i am the youngest of that name, for
fault of a worse.

nurse.
you say well.

mercutio.
yea, is the worst well? very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.

nurse.
if you be he, sir, i [[desire]] some confidence with you.

benvolio.
she will endite him to some supper.

mercutio.
a bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

romeo.
what hast thou found?

mercutio.
no hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something
stale and hoar ere it be spent.
[_sings._]
    an old hare hoar,
    and an old hare hoar,
  is very [[good]] meat in lent;
    but a hare that is hoar
    is too much for a score
  when it hoars ere it be spent.
romeo, will you come to your father’s? we’ll to dinner thither.

romeo.
i will [[follow]] you.

mercutio.
farewell, ancient [[lady]]; farewell, [[lady]], [[lady]], [[lady]].

 [_exeunt mercutio and benvolio._]

nurse.
i [[pray]] you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his
ropery?

romeo.
a gentleman, nurse, that loves [[love]] to hear himself talk, and will speak
more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

nurse.
and a speak anything against me, i’ll take him down, and a were lustier
than he is, and twenty such jacks. and if i cannot, i’ll find those
that shall. scurvy knave! i am none of his flirt-gills; i am none of
his skains-mates.—and thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to
use me at his pleasure!

peter.
i saw no [[man]] use you at his [[pleasure]]; if i had, my weapon should
quickly have been out. i warrant you, i dare draw as soon as another
man, if i see [[occasion]] in a [[good]] quarrel, and the [[law]] on my side.

nurse.
now, afore [[god]], i am so vexed that every part about me quivers. scurvy
knave. [[pray]] you, sir, a word: and as i told you, my [[young]] [[lady]] bid me
enquire you out; what she bade me say, i will keep to myself. but first
let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they
say, it were a very gross [[kind]] of behaviour, as they say; for the
gentlewoman is [[young]]. and therefore, if you should deal double with
her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and
very [[weak]] dealing.

romeo. nurse, commend me to thy [[lady]] and mistress. i [[protest]] unto
thee,—

nurse.
good [[heart]], and i’faith i will tell her as much. [[lord]], [[lord]], she will
be a joyful woman.

romeo.
what wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

nurse.
i will tell her, sir, that you do [[protest]], which, as i take it, is a
gentlemanlike offer.

romeo.
bid her devise
some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
and there she shall at friar lawrence’ cell
be shriv’d and [[married]]. here is for thy pains [[pain]].

nurse.
no truly, sir; not a penny.

romeo.
go to; i say you shall.

nurse.
this afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

romeo.
and stay, [[good]] nurse, behind the abbey wall.
within this hour my [[man]] shall be with thee,
and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
which to the high topgallant of my joy
must be my convoy in the secret night.
farewell, be trusty, and i’ll quit thy pains [[pain]];
farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

nurse.
now [[god]] in [[heaven]] bless thee. hark you, sir.

romeo.
what say’st thou, my dear nurse?

nurse.
is your [[man]] secret? did you ne’er hear say,
two may keep counsel, putting one away?

romeo.
i warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.

nurse.
well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest [[lady]]. [[lord]], lord! when ’twas a
little prating thing,—o, there is a nobleman in town, one [[paris]], that
would fain lay knife aboard; but she, [[good]] [[soul]], had as lief see a
toad, a very toad, as see him. i anger her sometimes, and tell her that
paris is the properer [[man]], but i’ll warrant you, when i say so, she
looks as pale as any clout in the versal [[world]]. doth not rosemary and
romeo begin both with a letter?

romeo.
ay, nurse; what of that? both with an r.

nurse.
ah, mocker! that’s the dog’s name. r is for the—no, i [[know]] it begins
with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,
of you and rosemary, that it would do you [[good]] to hear it.

romeo.
commend me to thy [[lady]].

nurse.
ay, a thousand times [[time]]. peter!

 [_exit romeo._]

 enter juliet.

juliet.
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse,
in half an hour she promised to return.
perchance she cannot meet him. that’s not so.
o, she is lame. love’s heralds should be thoughts [[thought]],
which ten times [[time]] faster glides than the sun’s beams,
driving back shadows over lowering hills:
therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw [[love]],
and therefore hath the wind-swift cupid wings.
now is the sun upon the highmost hill
of this day’s [[journey]], and from nine till twelve
is three long hours, yet she is not come.
had she affections and warm youthful [[blood]],
she’d be as swift in motion as a ball;
my words would bandy her to my sweet [[love]],
and his to me.
but old folks, many feign as they were [[dead]];
unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.

 enter nurse and peter.

o [[god]], she comes. o honey nurse, what news?
hast thou met with him? send thy [[man]] away.

nurse.
peter, stay at the gate.

 [_exit peter._]

juliet.
now, [[good]] sweet nurse,—o [[lord]], why look’st thou [[sad]]?
though news be [[sad]], yet tell them merrily;
if [[good]], thou sham’st the [[music]] of sweet news
by playing it to me with so sour a face.

nurse.
i am aweary, give me leave awhile;
fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have i had!

juliet.
i would thou hadst my bones, and i thy news:
nay come, i [[pray]] thee speak; [[good]], [[good]] nurse, speak.

nurse.
jesu, what haste? can you not stay a while? do you not see that i am
out of breath?

juliet.
how art [[arts]] thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
to say to me that thou art [[arts]] out of breath?
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay
is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
is thy news [[good]] or [[bad]]? [[answer]] to that;
say either, and i’ll stay the circumstance.
let me be satisfied, is’t [[good]] or [[bad]]?

nurse.
well, you have made a simple [[choice]]; you [[know]] not how to choose a [[man]].
romeo? no, not he. though his face be [[better]] than any man’s, yet his
leg excels all [[men’s]], and for a hand and a foot, and a [[body]], though
they be not to be talked on, yet they are [[past]] compare. he is not the
flower of courtesy, but i’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. go thy
ways, wench, serve [[god]]. what, have you dined at [[home]]?

juliet.
no, no. but all this did i [[know]] before.
what says he of our [[marriage]]? what of that?

nurse.
lord, how my head aches! what a head have i!
it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
my back o’ t’other side,—o my back, my back!
beshrew your [[heart]] for sending me about
to catch my [[death]] with jauncing up and down.

juliet.
i’faith, i am [[sorry]] that thou art [[arts]] not well.
sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my [[love]]?

nurse.
your [[love]] says like an honest gentleman,
and a courteous, and a [[kind]], and a handsome,
and i warrant a [[virtuous]],—where is your [[mother]]?

juliet.
where is my [[mother]]? why, she is within.
where should she be? how oddly thou repliest.
‘your [[love]] says, like an honest gentleman,
‘where is your [[mother]]?’

nurse.
o [[god’s]] [[lady]] dear,
are you so hot? [[marry]], come up, i trow.
is this the poultice for my aching bones?
henceforward do your messages yourself.

juliet.
here’s such a coil. come, what says romeo?

nurse.
have you got leave to go to shrift today?

juliet.
i have.

nurse.
then hie you hence to friar lawrence’ cell;
there stays a husband to make you a [[wife]].
now comes the wanton [[blood]] up in your cheeks,
they’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
hie you to [[church]]. i must another way,
to fetch a ladder by the which your love
must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
i am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
but you shall bear the burden soon at night.
go. i’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

juliet.
hie to high fortune! honest nurse, farewell.

scene vi. friar lawrence’s cell.

 enter friar lawrence and romeo.

friar lawrence.
so smile the heavens [[heaven]] upon this holy act
that after-hours with [[sorrow]] chide us not.

romeo.
amen, amen, but come what [[sorrow]] can,
it cannot countervail the exchange of joy
that one short minute gives me in her sight.
do thou but close our hands with holy words,
then love-devouring [[death]] do what he dare,
it is enough i may but call her mine.

friar lawrence.
these [[violent]] delights have [[violent]] ends,
and in their triumph [[die]]; like [[fire]] and powder,
which as they kiss consume. the sweetest honey
is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
and in the taste confounds the appetite.
therefore [[love]] moderately: long [[love]] doth so;
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

 enter juliet.

here comes the [[lady]]. o, so [[light]] a foot
will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.
a lover may bestride the gossamers
that idles in the wanton summer air
and yet not fall; so [[light]] is vanity.

juliet.
good even to my ghostly confessor.

friar lawrence.
romeo shall thank thee, [[daughter]], for us both.

juliet.
as much to him, else is his thanks too much.

romeo.
ah, juliet, if the measure of thy joy
be heap’d like mine, and that thy [[skill]] be more
to blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
this neighbour air, and let [[rich]] music’s tongue
unfold the imagin’d [[happiness]] that both
receive in either by this dear encounter.

juliet.
conceit more [[rich]] in matter than in words,
brags of his substance, not of ornament.
they are but beggars that can count their worth;
but my true [[love]] is grown to such excess,
i cannot sum up sum of half my [[wealth]].

friar lawrence.
come, come with me, and we will make short [[work]],
for, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
till holy [[church]] incorporate two in one.

scene i. a [[public]] place.

 enter mercutio, benvolio, page and servants.

benvolio.
i [[pray]] thee, [[good]] mercutio, let’s retire:
the day is hot, the capulets abroad,
and if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
for now these hot days, is the mad [[blood]] stirring.

mercutio.
thou art [[arts]] like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of
a tavern, claps me his [[sword]] upon the table, and says ‘god send me no
need of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the
drawer, when indeed there is no need.

benvolio.
am i like such a fellow?

mercutio.
come, come, thou art [[arts]] as hot a jack in thy mood as any in [[italy]]; and as
soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.

benvolio.
and what to?

mercutio.
nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would
kill the other. thou? why, thou wilt quarrel with a [[man]] that hath a
hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. thou wilt quarrel
with a [[man]] for cracking nuts, having no other [[reason]] but because thou
hast hazel [[eyes]]. what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy
head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. thou hast
quarrelled with a [[man]] for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. didst thou not fall
out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter? with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? and yet thou wilt
tutor me from quarrelling!

benvolio.
and i were so apt to quarrel as thou art [[arts]], any [[man]] should buy the fee
simple of my [[life]] for an hour and a quarter.

mercutio.
the fee simple! o simple!

 enter tybalt and others.

benvolio.
by my head, here comes the capulets.

mercutio.
by my heel, i [[care]] not.

tybalt.
follow me close, for i will speak to them.
gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.

mercutio.
and but one word with one of us? couple it with something; make it a
word and a blow.

tybalt.
you shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me
occasion.

mercutio.
could you not take some [[occasion]] without giving?

tybalt.
mercutio, thou consortest with romeo.

mercutio.
consort? what, dost thou make us minstrels? and thou make minstrels of
us, look to hear nothing but discords. here’s my fiddlestick, here’s
that shall make you dance. zounds, consort!

benvolio.
we talk here in the [[public]] haunt of [[men]].
either withdraw unto some private place,
and [[reason]] coldly of your grievances,
or else depart; here all [[eyes]] gaze on us.

mercutio.
men’s [[eyes]] were made to look, and let them gaze.
i will not budge for no man’s [[pleasure]], i.

 enter romeo.

tybalt.
well, [[peace]] be with you, sir, here comes my [[man]].

mercutio.
but i’ll be [[hanged]], sir, if he wear your livery.
marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;
your [[worship]] in that sense may call him [[man]].

tybalt.
romeo, the [[love]] i bear thee can afford
no [[better]] term than this: thou art [[arts]] a villain.

romeo.
tybalt, the [[reason]] that i have to [[love]] thee
doth much excuse the appertaining rage
to such a greeting. villain am i none;
therefore farewell; i see thou know’st me not.

tybalt.
boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
that thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.

romeo.
i do [[protest]] i never injur’d thee,
but [[love]] thee [[better]] than thou canst devise
till thou shalt [[know]] the [[reason]] of my [[love]].
and so [[good]] capulet, which name i tender
as dearly as mine own, be satisfied.

mercutio.
o calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
[_draws._] alla stoccata carries it away.
tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

tybalt.
what wouldst thou have with me?

mercutio.
good [[king]] of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives [[life]]; that i mean to
make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest
of the eight. will you pluck your [[sword]] out of his pilcher by the ears?
make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.

tybalt.
[_drawing._] i am for you.

romeo.
gentle mercutio, put thy rapier up.

mercutio.
come, sir, your passado.

 [_they [[fight]]._]

romeo.
draw, benvolio; beat down their [[weapons]].
gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,
tybalt, mercutio, the [[prince]] expressly hath
forbid this bandying in verona streets.
hold, tybalt! [[good]] mercutio!

 [_exeunt tybalt with his partizans._]

mercutio.
i am hurt.
a plague o’ both your houses. i am sped.
is he gone, and hath nothing?

benvolio.
what, art [[arts]] thou hurt?

mercutio.
ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. [[marry]], ’tis enough.
where is my page? go villain, fetch a surgeon.

 [_exit page._]

romeo.
courage, [[man]]; the hurt cannot be much.

mercutio.
no, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a [[church]] door, but ’tis
enough, ’twill serve. ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a
grave [[man]]. i am peppered, i warrant, for this [[world]]. a plague o’ both
your houses. zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a [[man]] to
death. a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the [[book]] of
arithmetic!—why the [[devil]] came you between us? i was hurt under your
arm.

romeo.
i [[thought]] all for the [[best]].

mercutio.
help me into some house, benvolio,
or i shall faint. a plague o’ both your houses.
they have made worms’ meat of me.
i have it, and soundly too. your houses!

 [_exeunt mercutio and benvolio._]

romeo.
this gentleman, the prince’s near ally,
my very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
in my behalf; my [[reputation]] stain’d
with tybalt’s slander,—tybalt, that an hour
hath been my cousin. o sweet juliet,
thy [[beauty]] hath made me effeminate
and in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.

 re-enter benvolio.

benvolio.
o romeo, romeo, brave mercutio’s [[dead]],
that gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,
which too untimely here did scorn the [[earth]].

romeo.
this day’s black [[fate]] on mo days doth depend;
this but begins the woe others must end.

 re-enter tybalt.

benvolio.
here comes the furious tybalt back again.

romeo.
again in triumph, and mercutio slain?
away to [[heaven]] respective lenity,
and fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!
now, tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again
that late thou gav’st me, for mercutio’s soul
is but a little way above our heads,
staying for thine to keep him company.
either thou or i, or both, must go with him.

tybalt.
thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
shalt with him hence.

romeo.
this shall determine that.

 [_they [[fight]]; tybalt falls._]

benvolio.
romeo, away, be gone!
the [[citizens]] are up, and tybalt slain.
stand not amaz’d. the [[prince]] will doom thee death
if thou art [[arts]] taken. hence, be gone, away!

romeo.
o, i am fortune’s fool!

benvolio.
why dost thou stay?

 [_exit romeo._]

 enter [[citizens]].

first citizen.
which way ran he that kill’d mercutio?
tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

benvolio.
there lies [[lie]] that tybalt.

first citizen.
up, sir, go with me.
i charge thee in the prince’s name obey.

 enter [[prince]], attended; montague, capulet, their wives [[wife]] and others.

prince.
where are the vile beginners of this fray?

benvolio.
o [[noble]] [[prince]], i can discover all
the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
there lies [[lie]] the [[man]], slain by [[young]] romeo,
that slew thy kinsman, brave mercutio.

lady capulet.
tybalt, my cousin! o my brother’s child!
o prince! o husband! o, the [[blood]] is spill’d
of my dear kinsman! [[prince]], as thou art [[arts]] true,
for [[blood]] of ours shed [[blood]] of montague.
o cousin, cousin.

prince.
benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

benvolio.
tybalt, here slain, whom romeo’s hand did slay;
romeo, that spoke him [[fair]], bid him bethink
how nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal
your high displeasure. all this uttered
with gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d
could not take truce with the unruly spleen
of tybalt, deaf to [[peace]], but that he tilts
with piercing steel at bold mercutio’s breast,
who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
and, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
cold [[death]] aside, and with the other sends
it back to tybalt, whose dexterity
retorts it. romeo he cries aloud,
‘hold, friends! [[friends]], part!’ and swifter than his tongue,
his agile arm beats down their fatal points,
and ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
of stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled.
but by and by comes back to romeo,
who had but newly entertain’d [[revenge]],
and to’t they go like lightning; for, ere i
could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain;
and as he fell did romeo turn and fly.
this is the [[truth]], or let benvolio [[die]].

lady capulet.
he is a kinsman to the montague.
affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
and all those twenty could but kill one [[life]].
i beg for [[justice]], which thou, [[prince]], must give;
romeo slew tybalt, romeo must not [[live]].

prince.
romeo slew him, he slew mercutio.
who now the price of his dear [[blood]] doth owe?

montague.
not romeo, [[prince]], he was mercutio’s friend;
his [[fault]] concludes but what the [[law]] should end,
the [[life]] of tybalt.

prince.
and for that offence
immediately we do [[exile]] him hence.
i have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,
my [[blood]] for your rude brawls doth [[lie]] a-bleeding.
but i’ll amerce you with so [[strong]] a fine
that you shall all repent the loss of mine.
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses [[abuse]].
therefore use none. let romeo hence in haste,
else, when he is found, that hour is his [[last]].
bear hence this [[body]], and attend our will.
mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. a room in capulet’s house.

 enter juliet.

juliet.
gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
towards phoebus’ lodging. such a waggoner
as phaeton would whip you to the west
and bring in cloudy night immediately.
spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
that runaway’s [[eyes]] may wink, and romeo
leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.
lovers can see to do their amorous rites
by their own beauties [[beauty]]: or, if [[love]] be blind,
it [[best]] agrees with night. come, civil night,
thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
and learn me how to lose a winning match,
play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
hood my unmann’d [[blood]], bating in my cheeks,
with thy black mantle, till [[strange]] [[love]], grow bold,
think true [[love]] acted simple modesty.
come, night, come romeo; come, thou day in night;
for thou wilt [[lie]] upon the wings of night
whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,
give me my romeo, and when i shall [[die]],
take him and cut him out in little stars,
and he will make the face of [[heaven]] so fine
that all the [[world]] will be in [[love]] with night,
and [[pay]] no [[worship]] to the garish sun.
o, i have bought the mansion of a [[love]],
but not possess’d it; and though i am sold,
not yet enjoy’d. so tedious is this day
as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child that hath new robes
and may not wear them. o, here comes my nurse,
and she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
but romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.

 enter nurse, with cords.

now, nurse, what news? what hast thou there?
the cords that romeo bid thee fetch?

nurse.
ay, ay, the cords.

 [_throws them down._]

juliet.
ay me, what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

nurse.
ah, well-a-day, he’s [[dead]], he’s [[dead]], he’s dead!
we are undone, [[lady]], we are undone.
alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s [[dead]].

juliet.
can [[heaven]] be so envious?

nurse.
romeo can,
though [[heaven]] cannot. o romeo, romeo.
who ever would have [[thought]] it? romeo!

juliet.
what [[devil]] art [[arts]] thou, that dost torment me thus?
this torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.
hath romeo slain himself? say thou but ay,
and that bare vowel i shall poison more
than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
i am not i if there be such an i;
or those [[eyes]] shut that make thee [[answer]] ay.
if he be slain, say ay; or if not, no.
brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

nurse.
i saw the wound, i saw it with mine [[eyes]],
god save the mark!—here on his manly breast.
a piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in [[blood]],
all in gore-blood. i swounded at the sight.

juliet.
o, break, my [[heart]]. [[poor]] bankrout, break at once.
to prison, [[eyes]]; ne’er look on [[liberty]].
vile [[earth]] to [[earth]] resign; end motion here,
and thou and romeo press one heavy bier.

nurse.
o tybalt, tybalt, the [[best]] friend i had.
o courteous tybalt, honest gentleman!
that ever i should [[live]] to see thee [[dead]].

juliet.
what storm is this that blows so contrary?
is romeo slaughter’d and is tybalt [[dead]]?
my dearest cousin, and my dearer [[lord]]?
then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,
for who is living, if those two are gone?

nurse.
tybalt is gone, and romeo [[banished]],
romeo that kill’d him, he is [[banished]].

juliet.
o god! did romeo’s hand shed tybalt’s [[blood]]?

nurse.
it did, it did; alas the day, it did.

juliet.
o serpent [[heart]], hid with a flowering face!
did ever dragon keep so [[fair]] a cave?
beautiful [[tyrant]], fiend angelical,
dove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
despised substance of divinest show!
just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
a damned saint, an honourable villain!
o [[nature]], what hadst thou to do in hell
when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
was ever [[book]] containing such vile matter
so fairly bound? o, that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace.

nurse.
there’s no trust,
no [[faith]], no honesty in [[men]]. all perjur’d,
all forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
ah, where’s my [[man]]? give me some aqua vitae.
these griefs, these woes, these sorrows [[sorrow]] make me old.
shame come to romeo.

juliet.
blister’d be thy tongue
for such a wish! he was not born to shame.
upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;
for ’tis a [[throne]] where [[honour]] may be crown’d
sole monarch of the universal [[earth]].
o, what a beast was i to chide at him!

nurse.
will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?

juliet.
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband?
ah, [[poor]] my [[lord]], what tongue shall smooth thy name,
when i thy three-hours’ [[wife]] have mangled it?
but wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
that villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,
your tributary drops belong to woe,
which you mistaking offer up to joy.
my husband lives [[life]], that tybalt would have slain,
and tybalt’s [[dead]], that would have slain my husband.
all this is comfort; wherefore weep i then?
some word there was, worser than tybalt’s [[death]],
that murder’d me. i would forget it fain,
but o, it presses to my memory
like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds [[mind]].
tybalt is [[dead]], and romeo [[banished]].
that ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’
hath slain ten thousand tybalts. tybalt’s death
was woe enough, if it had ended there.
or if sour woe delights in fellowship,
and needly will be rank’d with other griefs,
why follow’d not, when she said tybalt’s [[dead]],
thy [[father]] or thy [[mother]], nay or both,
which [[modern]] lamentation might have mov’d?
but with a rear-ward following tybalt’s [[death]],
‘romeo is banished’—to speak that word
is [[father]], [[mother]], tybalt, romeo, juliet,
all slain, all [[dead]]. romeo is [[banished]],
there is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
in that word’s [[death]], no words can that woe sound.
where is my [[father]] and my [[mother]], nurse?

nurse.
weeping and wailing over tybalt’s corse.
will you go to them? i will bring you thither.

juliet.
wash they his wounds with tears. mine shall be spent,
when theirs are dry, for romeo’s [[banishment]].
take up those cords. [[poor]] ropes, you are beguil’d,
both you and i; for romeo is exil’d.
he made you for a highway to my bed,
but i, a maid, [[die]] maiden-widowed.
come cords, come nurse, i’ll to my wedding bed,
and [[death]], not romeo, take my maidenhead.

nurse.
hie to your chamber. i’ll find romeo
to comfort you. i wot well where he is.
hark ye, your romeo will be here at night.
i’ll to him, he is hid at lawrence’ cell.

juliet.
o find him, give this ring to my true knight,
and bid him come to take his [[last]] farewell.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. friar lawrence’s cell.

 enter friar lawrence.

friar lawrence.
romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful [[man]].
affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts
and thou art [[arts]] wedded to calamity.

 enter romeo.

romeo.
father, what news? what is the prince’s doom?
what [[sorrow]] craves acquaintance at my hand,
that i yet [[know]] not?

friar lawrence.
too familiar
is my dear [[son]] with such sour company.
i bring thee tidings of the prince’s doom.

romeo.
what less than doomsday is the prince’s doom?

friar lawrence.
a gentler [[judgment]] vanish’d from his lips,
not body’s [[death]], but body’s [[banishment]].

romeo.
ha, [[banishment]]? be merciful, say [[death]];
for [[exile]] hath more terror in his look,
much more than [[death]]. do not say [[banishment]].

friar lawrence.
hence from verona art [[arts]] thou [[banished]].
be patient, for the [[world]] is broad and wide.

romeo.
there is no [[world]] without verona walls,
but [[purgatory]], torture, hell itself.
hence [[banished]] is banish’d from the [[world]],
and world’s [[exile]] is [[death]]. then banished
is [[death]] misterm’d. calling [[death]] [[banished]],
thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,
and smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

friar lawrence.
o deadly [[sin]], o rude unthankfulness!
thy [[fault]] our [[law]] calls [[death]], but the [[kind]] [[prince]],
taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the [[law]],
and turn’d that black word [[death]] to [[banishment]].
this is dear [[mercy]], and thou see’st it not.

romeo.
’tis torture, and not [[mercy]]. [[heaven]] is here
where juliet lives [[life]], and every cat and dog,
and little mouse, every unworthy thing,
live here in [[heaven]] and may look on her,
but romeo may not. more validity,
more honourable [[state]], more courtship lives
in carrion flies than romeo. they may seize
on the [[white]] wonder of dear juliet’s hand,
and steal [[immortal]] blessing from her lips,
who, even in pure and vestal modesty
still blush, as thinking their own kisses [[sin]].
but romeo may not, he is [[banished]].
this may flies do, when i from this must fly.
they are [[free]] [[men]] but i am [[banished]].
and say’st thou yet that [[exile]] is not [[death]]?
hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,
no sudden mean of [[death]], though ne’er so mean,
but [[banished]] to kill me? [[banished]]?
o friar, the damned use that word in hell.
howlings attends it. how hast thou the [[heart]],
being a [[divine]], a ghostly confessor,
a sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,
to mangle me with that word [[banished]]?

friar lawrence.
thou fond mad [[man]], hear me speak a little,

romeo.
o, thou wilt speak again of [[banishment]].

friar lawrence.
i’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,
adversity’s sweet milk, [[philosophy]],
to comfort thee, though thou art [[arts]] [[banished]].

romeo.
yet [[banished]]? hang up [[philosophy]].
unless [[philosophy]] can make a juliet,
displant a town, reverse a prince’s doom,
it helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.

friar lawrence.
o, then i see that mad [[men]] have no ears.

romeo.
how should they, when that [[wise]] [[men]] have no [[eyes]]?

friar lawrence.
let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

romeo.
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not [[feel]].
wert thou as [[young]] as i, juliet thy [[love]],
an hour but [[married]], tybalt murdered,
doting like me, and like me [[banished]],
then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
and fall upon the ground as i do now,
taking the measure of an unmade grave.

 [_knocking within._]

friar lawrence.
arise; one knocks. [[good]] romeo, hide thyself.

romeo.
not i, unless the breath of heartsick groans
mist-like infold me from the search of [[eyes]].

 [_knocking._]

friar lawrence.
hark, how they knock!—who’s there?—romeo, arise,
thou wilt be taken.—stay awhile.—stand up.

 [_knocking._]

run to my study.—by-and-by.—god’s will,
what simpleness is this.—i come, i come.

 [_knocking._]

who knocks so hard? whence come you, what’s your will?

nurse.
[_within._] let me come in, and you shall [[know]] my errand.
i come from [[lady]] juliet.

friar lawrence.
welcome then.

 enter nurse.

nurse.
o holy friar, o, tell me, holy friar,
where is my lady’s [[lord]], where’s romeo?

friar lawrence.
there on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

nurse.
o, he is even in my mistress’ case.
just in her case! o woeful sympathy!
piteous predicament. even so lies [[lie]] she,
blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a [[man]].
for juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
why should you fall into so deep an o?

romeo.
nurse.

nurse.
ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.

romeo.
spakest thou of juliet? how is it with her?
doth not she [[think]] me an old murderer,
now i have stain’d the [[childhood]] of our joy
with [[blood]] remov’d but little from her own?
where is she? and how doth she? and what says
my conceal’d [[lady]] to our cancell’d [[love]]?

nurse.
o, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
and now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
and tybalt calls, and then on romeo cries,
and then down falls again.

romeo.
as if that name,
shot from the deadly level of a gun,
did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand
murder’d her kinsman. o, tell me, friar, tell me,
in what vile part of this anatomy
doth my name lodge? tell me, that i may sack
the hateful mansion.

 [_drawing his [[sword]]._]

friar lawrence.
hold thy desperate hand.
art thou a [[man]]? thy form cries out thou art [[arts]].
thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
the unreasonable fury of a beast.
unseemly woman in a seeming [[man]],
and ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
thou hast amaz’d me. by my holy order,
i [[thought]] thy disposition [[better]] temper’d.
hast thou slain tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
and slay thy [[lady]], that in thy [[life]] lives [[life]],
by doing damned hate upon thyself?
why rail’st thou on thy birth, the [[heaven]] and [[earth]]?
since birth, and [[heaven]] and [[earth]], all three do meet
in thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy [[love]], thy wit,
which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,
and usest none in that true use indeed
which should bedeck thy shape, thy [[love]], thy wit.
thy [[noble]] shape is but a form of wax,
digressing from the valour of a [[man]];
thy dear [[love]] sworn but hollow perjury,
killing that [[love]] which thou hast vow’d to cherish;
thy wit, that ornament to shape and [[love]],
misshapen in the conduct of them both,
like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,
is set afire by thine own ignorance,
and thou dismember’d with thine own defence.
what, rouse thee, [[man]]. thy juliet is alive,
for whose dear sake thou wast but lately [[dead]].
there art [[arts]] thou [[happy]]. tybalt would kill thee,
but thou slew’st tybalt; there art [[arts]] thou [[happy]].
the [[law]] that threaten’d [[death]] becomes thy friend,
and turns it to [[exile]]; there art [[arts]] thou [[happy]].
a pack of blessings [[light]] upon thy back;
happiness courts thee in her [[best]] array;
but like a misshaped and sullen wench,
thou putt’st up thy [[fortune]] and thy [[love]].
take heed, take heed, for such [[die]] miserable.
go, get thee to thy [[love]] as was decreed,
ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
but look thou stay not till the watch be set,
for then thou canst not pass to mantua;
where thou shalt [[live]] till we can find a time
to blaze your [[marriage]], reconcile your [[friends]],
beg pardon of the [[prince]], and call thee back
with twenty hundred thousand times [[time]] more joy
than thou went’st forth in lamentation.
go before, nurse. commend me to thy [[lady]],
and bid her hasten all the house to bed,
which heavy [[sorrow]] makes them apt unto.
romeo is coming.

nurse.
o [[lord]], i could have stay’d here all the night
to hear [[good]] counsel. o, what learning is!
my [[lord]], i’ll tell my [[lady]] you will come.

romeo.
do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

nurse.
here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

 [_exit._]

romeo.
how well my comfort is reviv’d by this.

friar lawrence.
go hence, [[good]] night, and here stands all your [[state]]:
either be gone before the watch be set,
or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
sojourn in mantua. i’ll find out your [[man]],
and he shall signify from [[time]] to time
every [[good]] hap to you that chances [[chance]] here.
give me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; [[good]] night.

romeo.
but that a joy [[past]] joy calls out on me,
it were a [[grief]] so brief to part with thee.
farewell.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iv. a room in capulet’s house.

 enter capulet, [[lady]] capulet and [[paris]].

capulet.
things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
that we have had no [[time]] to move our [[daughter]].
look you, she lov’d her kinsman tybalt dearly,
and so did i. well, we were born to [[die]].
’tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.
i promise you, but for your company,
i would have been abed an hour ago.

paris.
these times [[time]] of woe afford no tune to woo.
madam, [[good]] night. commend me to your [[daughter]].

lady capulet.
i will, and [[know]] her [[mind]] early tomorrow;
tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.

capulet.
sir [[paris]], i will make a desperate tender
of my child’s [[love]]. i [[think]] she will be rul’d
in all respects [[respect]] by me; nay more, i [[doubt]] it not.
wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
acquaint her here of my [[son]] paris’ [[love]],
and bid her, mark you me, on wednesday next,
but, soft, what day is this?

paris.
monday, my [[lord]].

capulet.
monday! ha, ha! well, wednesday is too soon,
a thursday let it be; a thursday, tell her,
she shall be [[married]] to this [[noble]] earl.
will you be ready? do you like this haste?
we’ll keep no [[great]] ado,—a friend or two,
for, hark you, tybalt being slain so late,
it may be [[thought]] we held him carelessly,
being our kinsman, if we revel much.
therefore we’ll have some half a dozen [[friends]],
and there an end. but what say you to thursday?

paris.
my [[lord]], i would that thursday were tomorrow.

capulet.
well, get you gone. a thursday be it then.
go you to juliet ere you go to bed,
prepare her, [[wife]], against this wedding day.
farewell, my [[lord]].—light to my chamber, ho!
afore me, it is so very very late that we
may call it early by and by. [[good]] night.

 [_exeunt._]

scene v. an open gallery to juliet’s chamber, overlooking the garden.

 enter romeo and juliet.

juliet.
wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day.
it was the nightingale, and not the lark,
that pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;
nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
believe me, [[love]], it was the nightingale.

romeo.
it was the lark, the herald of the morn,
no nightingale. look, [[love]], what envious streaks
do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
i must be gone and [[live]], or stay and [[die]].

juliet.
yond [[light]] is not daylight, i [[know]] it, i.
it is some meteor that the sun exhales
to be to thee this night a torchbearer
and [[light]] thee on thy way to mantua.
therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.

romeo.
let me be ta’en, let me be put to [[death]],
i am content, so thou wilt have it so.
i’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,
’tis but the pale reflex of cynthia’s brow.
nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
the vaulty [[heaven]] so high above our heads.
i have more [[care]] to stay than will to go.
come, [[death]], and welcome. juliet wills it so.
how is’t, my [[soul]]? let’s talk. it is not day.

juliet.
it is, it is! hie hence, be gone, away.
it is the lark that sings so out of tune,
straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
some say the lark makes sweet division;
this doth not so, for she divideth us.
some say the lark and loathed toad [[change]] [[eyes]].
o, now i would they had chang’d voices too,
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.
o now be gone, more [[light]] and [[light]] it grows.

romeo.
more [[light]] and [[light]], more dark and dark our woes.

 enter nurse.

nurse.
madam.

juliet.
nurse?

nurse.
your [[lady]] [[mother]] is coming to your chamber.
the day is broke, be wary, look about.

 [_exit._]

juliet.
then, window, let day in, and let [[life]] out.

romeo.
farewell, farewell, one kiss, and i’ll descend.

 [_descends._]

juliet.
art thou gone so? [[love]], [[lord]], ay husband, friend,
i must hear from thee every day in the hour,
for in a minute there are many days.
o, by this count i shall be much in years
ere i again behold my romeo.

romeo.
farewell!
i will omit no opportunity
that may convey my greetings, [[love]], to thee.

juliet.
o thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?

romeo.
i [[doubt]] it not, and all these woes shall serve
for sweet discourses in our [[time]] to come.

juliet.
o god! i have an ill-divining soul!
methinks i see thee, now thou art [[arts]] so low,
as one [[dead]] in the bottom of a tomb.
either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.

romeo.
and trust me, [[love]], in my eye so do you.
dry [[sorrow]] drinks our [[blood]]. adieu, adieu.

 [_exit below._]

juliet.
o [[fortune]], fortune! all [[men]] call thee fickle,
if thou art [[arts]] fickle, what dost thou with him
that is renown’d for [[faith]]? be fickle, [[fortune]];
for then, i [[hope]] thou wilt not keep him long
but send him back.

lady capulet.
[_within._] ho, [[daughter]], are you up?

juliet.
who is’t that calls? is it my [[lady]] [[mother]]?
is she not down so late, or up so early?
what unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?

 enter [[lady]] capulet.

lady capulet.
why, how now, juliet?

juliet.
madam, i am not well.

lady capulet.
evermore weeping for your cousin’s [[death]]?
what, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
and if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him [[live]].
therefore have done: some [[grief]] shows much of [[love]],
but much of [[grief]] shows still some want of wit.

juliet.
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

lady capulet.
so shall you [[feel]] the loss, but not the friend
which you weep for.

juliet.
feeling so the loss,
i cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

lady capulet.
well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death
as that the villain lives [[life]] which slaughter’d him.

juliet.
what villain, madam?

lady capulet.
that same villain romeo.

juliet.
villain and he be many miles asunder.
god pardon him. i do, with all my [[heart]].
and yet no [[man]] like he doth grieve my [[heart]].

lady capulet.
that is because the traitor murderer lives [[life]].

juliet.
ay madam, from the reach of these my hands.
would none but i might venge my cousin’s [[death]].

lady capulet.
we will have vengeance for it, [[fear]] thou not.
then weep no more. i’ll send to one in mantua,
where that same banish’d runagate doth [[live]],
shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram
that he shall soon keep tybalt company:
and then i [[hope]] thou wilt be satisfied.

juliet.
indeed i never shall be satisfied
with romeo till i behold him—dead—
is my [[poor]] [[heart]] so for a kinsman vex’d.
madam, if you could find out but a man
to bear a poison, i would temper it,
that romeo should upon receipt thereof,
soon sleep in quiet. o, how my [[heart]] abhors
to hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,
to wreak the [[love]] i bore my cousin
upon his [[body]] that hath slaughter’d him.

lady capulet.
find thou the means, and i’ll find such a [[man]].
but now i’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

juliet.
and joy comes well in such a needy [[time]].
what are they, i beseech your ladyship?

lady capulet.
well, well, thou hast a careful [[father]], child;
one who to put thee from thy heaviness,
hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
that thou expects not, nor i look’d not for.

juliet.
madam, in [[happy]] [[time]], what day is that?

lady capulet.
marry, my child, early next thursday morn
the gallant, [[young]], and [[noble]] gentleman,
the county [[paris]], at saint peter’s [[church]],
shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

juliet.
now by saint peter’s [[church]], and peter too,
he shall not make me there a joyful bride.
i wonder at this haste, that i must wed
ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
i [[pray]] you tell my [[lord]] and [[father]], madam,
i will not [[marry]] yet; and when i do, i swear
it shall be romeo, whom you [[know]] i hate,
rather than [[paris]]. these are news indeed.

lady capulet.
here comes your [[father]], tell him so yourself,
and see how he will take it at your hands.

 enter capulet and nurse.

capulet.
when the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
but for the sunset of my brother’s son
it rains downright.
how now? a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
evermore showering? in one little body
thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
for still thy [[eyes]], which i may call the sea,
do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy [[body]] is,
sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,
who raging with thy tears and they with them,
without a sudden calm will overset
thy tempest-tossed [[body]]. how now, [[wife]]?
have you deliver’d to her our decree?

lady capulet.
ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
i would the [[fool]] were [[married]] to her grave.

capulet.
soft. take me with you, take me with you, [[wife]].
how, will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

juliet.
not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
proud can i never be of what i hate;
but thankful even for hate that is meant [[love]].

capulet.
how now, how now, chopp’d [[logic]]? what is this?
proud, and, i thank you, and i thank you not;
and yet not proud. mistress minion you,
thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
but fettle your fine joints ’gainst thursday next
to go with [[paris]] to saint peter’s [[church]],
or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
you tallow-face!

lady capulet.
fie, fie! what, are you mad?

juliet.
good [[father]], i beseech you on my knees,
hear me with patience but to speak a word.

capulet.
hang thee [[young]] baggage, disobedient wretch!
i tell thee what,—get thee to [[church]] a thursday,
or never after look me in the face.
speak not, reply not, do not [[answer]] me.
my fingers itch. [[wife]], we scarce [[thought]] us blest
that [[god]] had lent us but this only child;
but now i see this one is one too much,
and that we have a curse in having her.
out on her, hilding.

nurse.
god in [[heaven]] bless her.
you are to blame, my [[lord]], to rate her so.

capulet.
and why, my [[lady]] [[wisdom]]? hold your tongue,
good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

nurse.
i speak no [[treason]].

capulet.
o [[god]] ye good-en!

nurse.
may not one speak?

capulet.
peace, you mumbling fool!
utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,
for here we need it not.

lady capulet.
you are too hot.

capulet.
god’s bread, it makes me mad!
day, night, hour, ride, [[time]], [[work]], play,
alone, in company, still my [[care]] hath been
to have her match’d, and having now provided
a gentleman of [[noble]] parentage,
of [[fair]] demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,
stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,
proportion’d as one’s [[thought]] would [[wish]] a [[man]],
and then to have a wretched puling [[fool]],
a whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,
to [[answer]], ‘i’ll not wed, i cannot [[love]],
i am too [[young]], i [[pray]] you pardon me.’
but, and you will not wed, i’ll pardon you.
graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
look to’t, [[think]] on’t, i do not use to jest.
thursday is near; lay hand on [[heart]], advise.
and you be mine, i’ll give you to my friend;
and you be not, hang, beg, starve, [[die]] in the streets,
for by my [[soul]], i’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,
nor what is mine shall never do thee [[good]].
trust to’t, bethink you, i’ll not be forsworn.

 [_exit._]

juliet.
is there no [[pity]] sitting in the clouds,
that sees into the bottom of my [[grief]]?
o sweet my [[mother]], cast me not away,
delay this [[marriage]] for a month, a week,
or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
in that dim monument where tybalt lies [[lie]].

lady capulet.
talk not to me, for i’ll not speak a word.
do as thou wilt, for i have done with thee.

 [_exit._]

juliet.
o god! o nurse, how shall this be prevented?
my husband is on [[earth]], my [[faith]] in [[heaven]].
how shall that [[faith]] return again to [[earth]],
unless that husband send it me from heaven
by leaving [[earth]]? comfort me, counsel me.
alack, alack, that [[heaven]] should practise stratagems
upon so soft a [[subject]] as myself.
what say’st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
some comfort, nurse.

nurse.
faith, here it is.
romeo is [[banished]]; and all the [[world]] to nothing
that he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.
or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
i [[think]] it [[best]] you [[married]] with the county.
o, he’s a lovely gentleman.
romeo’s a dishclout to him. an eagle, madam,
hath not so green, so quick, so [[fair]] an eye
as [[paris]] hath. beshrew my very [[heart]],
i [[think]] you are [[happy]] in this second match,
for it excels your first: or if it did not,
your first is [[dead]], or ’twere as [[good]] he were,
as living here and you no use of him.

juliet.
speakest thou from thy [[heart]]?

nurse.
and from my [[soul]] too,
or else beshrew them both.

juliet.
amen.

nurse.
what?

juliet.
well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
go in, and tell my [[lady]] i am gone,
having displeas’d my [[father]], to lawrence’ cell,
to make [[confession]] and to be absolv’d.

nurse.
marry, i will; and this is wisely done.

 [_exit._]

juliet.
ancient damnation! o most wicked fiend!
is it more [[sin]] to [[wish]] me thus forsworn,
or to dispraise my [[lord]] with that same tongue
which she hath prais’d him with above compare
so many thousand times [[time]]? go, counsellor.
thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
i’ll to the friar to [[know]] his remedy.
if all else fail, myself have [[power]] to [[die]].

 [_exit._]



act iv

scene i. friar lawrence’s cell.

 enter friar lawrence and [[paris]].

friar lawrence.
on thursday, sir? the [[time]] is very short.

paris.
my [[father]] capulet will have it so;
and i am nothing slow to slack his haste.

friar lawrence.
you say you do not [[know]] the lady’s [[mind]].
uneven is the course; i like it not.

paris.
immoderately she weeps for tybalt’s [[death]],
and therefore have i little talk’d of [[love]];
for [[venus]] smiles not in a house of tears.
now, sir, her [[father]] counts it dangerous
that she do give her [[sorrow]] so much sway;
and in his [[wisdom]], hastes our [[marriage]],
to stop the inundation of her tears,
which, too much minded by herself alone,
may be put from her by [[society]].
now do you [[know]] the [[reason]] of this haste.

friar lawrence.
[_aside._] i would i knew not why it should be slow’d.—
look, sir, here comes the [[lady]] toward my cell.

 enter juliet.

paris.
happily met, my [[lady]] and my wife!

juliet.
that may be, sir, when i may be a [[wife]].

paris.
that may be, must be, [[love]], on thursday next.

juliet.
what must be shall be.

friar lawrence.
that’s a [[certain]] text.

paris.
come you to make [[confession]] to this [[father]]?

juliet.
to [[answer]] that, i should confess to you.

paris.
do not deny to him that you [[love]] me.

juliet.
i will confess to you that i [[love]] him.

paris.
so will ye, i am sure, that you [[love]] me.

juliet.
if i do so, it will be of more price,
being spoke behind your back than to your face.

paris.
poor [[soul]], thy face is much abus’d with tears.

juliet.
the tears have got small [[victory]] by that;
for it was [[bad]] enough before their spite.

paris.
thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.

juliet.
that is no slander, sir, which is a [[truth]],
and what i spake, i spake it to my face.

paris.
thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.

juliet.
it may be so, for it is not mine own.
are you at leisure, holy [[father]], now,
or shall i come to you at evening mass?

friar lawrence.
my leisure serves me, pensive [[daughter]], now.—
my [[lord]], we must entreat the [[time]] alone.

paris.
god shield i should disturb devotion!—
juliet, on thursday early will i rouse ye,
till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

 [_exit._]

juliet.
o shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
come weep with me, [[past]] [[hope]], [[past]] cure, [[past]] help!

friar lawrence.
o juliet, i already [[know]] thy [[grief]];
it strains me [[past]] the compass of my wits.
i hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
on thursday next be [[married]] to this county.

juliet.
tell me not, friar, that thou hear’st of this,
unless thou tell me how i may prevent it.
if in thy [[wisdom]], thou canst give no [[help]],
do thou but call my resolution [[wise]],
and with this knife i’ll [[help]] it presently.
god join’d my [[heart]] and romeo’s, thou our hands;
and ere this hand, by thee to romeo’s seal’d,
shall be the label to another deed,
or my true [[heart]] with [[treacherous]] revolt
turn to another, this shall slay them both.
therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d [[time]],
give me some [[present]] counsel, or behold
’twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
shall play the [[empire]], arbitrating that
which the commission of thy years and art
could to no issue of true [[honour]] bring.
be not so long to speak. i long to [[die]],
if what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.

friar lawrence.
hold, [[daughter]]. i do spy a [[kind]] of [[hope]],
which craves as desperate an execution
as that is desperate which we would prevent.
if, rather than to [[marry]] county paris
thou hast the [[strength]] of will to slay thyself,
then is it likely thou wilt undertake
a thing like [[death]] to chide away this shame,
that cop’st with [[death]] himself to scape from it.
and if thou dar’st, i’ll give thee remedy.

juliet.
o, bid me leap, rather than [[marry]] [[paris]],
from off the battlements of yonder tower,
or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
where serpents are. chain me with roaring bears;
or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,
o’er-cover’d quite with [[dead]] [[men’s]] rattling bones,
with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
or bid me go into a new-made grave,
and hide me with a [[dead]] [[man]] in his shroud;
things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,
and i will do it without [[fear]] or [[doubt]],
to [[live]] an unstain’d [[wife]] to my sweet [[love]].

friar lawrence.
hold then. go [[home]], be merry, give consent
to [[marry]] [[paris]]. wednesday is tomorrow;
tomorrow night look that thou [[lie]] alone,
let not thy nurse [[lie]] with thee in thy chamber.
take thou this vial, being then in bed,
and this distilled liquor drink thou off,
when presently through all thy veins shall run
a cold and drowsy [[humour]]; for no pulse
shall keep his native [[progress]], but surcease.
no warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,
the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
to paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,
like [[death]] when he shuts up the day of [[life]].
each part depriv’d of supple [[government]],
shall stiff and stark and cold appear like [[death]].
and in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death
thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
to rouse thee from thy bed, there art [[arts]] thou [[dead]].
then as the manner of our [[country]] is,
in thy [[best]] robes, uncover’d, on the bier,
thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
where all the kindred of the capulets [[lie]].
in the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
shall romeo by my letters [[know]] our drift,
and hither shall he come, and he and i
will watch thy waking, and that very night
shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua.
and this shall [[free]] thee from this [[present]] shame,
if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
abate thy valour in the acting it.

juliet.
give me, give me! o tell not me of fear!

friar lawrence.
hold; get you gone, be [[strong]] and prosperous
in this resolve. i’ll send a friar with speed
to mantua, with my letters to thy [[lord]].

juliet.
love give me [[strength]], and [[strength]] shall [[help]] afford.
farewell, dear [[father]].

scene ii. hall in capulet’s house.

 enter capulet, [[lady]] capulet, nurse and servants.

capulet.
so many guests invite as here are writ.

 [_exit first servant._]

sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

second servant.
you shall have none ill, sir; for i’ll try if they can lick their
fingers.

capulet.
how canst thou try them so?

second servant.
marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;
therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.

capulet.
go, begone.

 [_exit second servant._]

we shall be much unfurnish’d for this [[time]].
what, is my [[daughter]] gone to friar lawrence?

nurse.
ay, forsooth.

capulet.
well, he may [[chance]] to do some [[good]] on her.
a peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.

 enter juliet.

nurse.
see where she comes from shrift with merry look.

capulet.
how now, my headstrong. where have you been gadding?

juliet.
where i have learnt me to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition
to you and your behests; and am enjoin’d
by holy lawrence to fall prostrate here,
to beg your pardon. pardon, i beseech you.
henceforward i am ever rul’d by you.

capulet.
send for the county, go tell him of this.
i’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.

juliet.
i met the youthful [[lord]] at lawrence’ cell,
and gave him what becomed [[love]] i might,
not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.

capulet.
why, i am glad on’t. this is well. stand up.
this is as’t should be. let me see the county.
ay, [[marry]]. go, i say, and fetch him hither.
now afore [[god]], this reverend holy friar,
all our whole [[city]] is much bound to him.

juliet.
nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
to [[help]] me sort such needful ornaments
as you [[think]] fit to furnish me tomorrow?

lady capulet.
no, not till thursday. there is [[time]] enough.

capulet.
go, nurse, go with her. we’ll to [[church]] tomorrow.

 [_exeunt juliet and nurse._]

lady capulet.
we shall be short in our provision,
’tis now near night.

capulet.
tush, i will stir about,
and all things shall be well, i warrant thee, [[wife]].
go thou to juliet, [[help]] to deck up her.
i’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.
i’ll play the housewife for this once.—what, ho!—
they are all forth: well, i will walk myself
to county [[paris]], to prepare him up
against tomorrow. my [[heart]] is wondrous light
since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. juliet’s chamber.

 enter juliet and nurse.

juliet.
ay, those attires are [[best]]. but, gentle nurse,
i [[pray]] thee leave me to myself tonight;
for i have need of many orisons
to move the heavens [[heaven]] to smile upon my [[state]],
which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of [[sin]].

 enter [[lady]] capulet.

lady capulet.
what, are you busy, ho? need you my [[help]]?

juliet.
no, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries
as are behoveful for our [[state]] tomorrow.
so please you, let me now be left alone,
and let the nurse this night sit up with you,
for i am sure you have your hands full all
in this so sudden [[business]].

lady capulet.
good night.
get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.

 [_exeunt [[lady]] capulet and nurse._]

juliet.
farewell. [[god]] knows [[know]] when we shall meet again.
i have a faint cold [[fear]] thrills through my veins
that almost freezes up the heat of [[life]].
i’ll call them back again to comfort me.
nurse!—what should she do here?
my dismal scene i needs must act alone.
come, vial.
what if this mixture do not [[work]] at all?
shall i be [[married]] then tomorrow morning?
no, no! this shall forbid it. [[lie]] thou there.

 [_laying down her dagger._]

what if it be a poison, which the friar
subtly hath minister’d to have me [[dead]],
lest in this [[marriage]] he should be dishonour’d,
because he [[married]] me before to romeo?
i [[fear]] it is. and yet methinks it should not,
for he hath still been tried a holy [[man]].
how if, when i am laid into the tomb,
i wake before the [[time]] that romeo
come to redeem me? there’s a fearful point!
shall i not then be stifled in the vault,
to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
and there [[die]] strangled ere my romeo comes?
or, if i [[live]], is it not very like,
the horrible conceit of [[death]] and night,
together with the terror of the place,
as in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
where for this many hundred years the bones
of all my buried [[ancestors]] are pack’d,
where bloody tybalt, yet but green in [[earth]],
lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
at some hours in the night spirits resort—
alack, alack, is it not like that i,
so early waking, what with loathsome smells,
and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the [[earth]],
that living mortals, hearing them, run mad.
o, if i wake, shall i not be distraught,
environed with all these hideous fears [[fear]],
and madly play with my forefathers’ joints?
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud?
and, in this rage, with some [[great]] kinsman’s bone,
as with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
o look, methinks i see my cousin’s ghost
seeking out romeo that did spit his body
upon a rapier’s point. stay, tybalt, stay!
romeo, romeo, romeo, here’s drink! i drink to thee.

nurse.
go, you cot-quean, go,
get you to bed; [[faith]], you’ll be sick tomorrow
for this night’s watching.

capulet.
no, not a whit. what! i have watch’d ere now
all night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.

lady capulet.
ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your [[time]];
but i will watch you from such watching now.

why, lamb, why, [[lady]], fie, you slug-abed!
why, [[love]], i say! madam! sweetheart! why, bride!
what, not a word? you take your pennyworths now.
sleep for a week; for the next night, i warrant,
the county [[paris]] hath set up his rest
that you shall rest but little. [[god]] [[forgive]] me!
marry and amen. how sound is she asleep!
i needs must wake her. madam, madam, madam!
ay, let the county take you in your bed,
he’ll fright you up, i’faith. will it not be?
what, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?
i must needs wake you. lady! lady! lady!
alas, alas! [[help]], help! my lady’s dead!
o, well-a-day that ever i was born.
some aqua vitae, ho! my lord! my lady!

o lamentable day!

lady capulet.
what is the matter?

revive, look up, or i will [[die]] with thee.
help, help! call [[help]].

for shame, bring juliet forth, her [[lord]] is come.

nurse.
she’s [[dead]], deceas’d, she’s [[dead]]; alack the day!

lady capulet.
alack the day, she’s [[dead]], she’s [[dead]], she’s dead!

capulet.
ha! let me see her. out alas! she’s cold,
her [[blood]] is settled and her joints are stiff.
life and these lips have long been separated.
death lies [[lie]] on her like an untimely frost
upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

nurse.
o lamentable day!

lady capulet.
o woful time!

capulet.
death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,
ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.

 enter friar lawrence and [[paris]] with musicians.

friar lawrence.
come, is the bride ready to go to [[church]]?

capulet.
ready to go, but never to return.
o [[son]], the night before thy wedding day
hath [[death]] lain with thy bride. there she lies [[lie]],
flower as she was, deflowered by him.
death is my son-in-law, [[death]] is my heir;
my [[daughter]] he hath wedded. i will [[die]].
and leave him all; [[life]], living, all is death’s.

paris.
have i [[thought]] long to see this morning’s face,
and doth it give me such a sight as this?

lady capulet.
accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.
most miserable hour that e’er [[time]] saw
in lasting [[labour]] of his pilgrimage.
but one, [[poor]] one, one [[poor]] and loving child,
but one thing to rejoice and solace in,
and cruel [[death]] hath catch’d it from my sight.

nurse.
o woe! o woeful, woeful, woeful day.
most lamentable day, most woeful day
that ever, ever, i did yet behold!
o day, o day, o day, o hateful day.
never was seen so black a day as this.
o woeful day, o woeful day.

paris.
beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.
most detestable [[death]], by thee beguil’d,
by cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.
o love! o life! not [[life]], but [[love]] in death!

capulet.
despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.
uncomfortable [[time]], why cam’st thou now
to murder, murder our solemnity?
o child! o child! my [[soul]], and not my child,
dead art [[arts]] thou. alack, my child is [[dead]],
and with my child my joys are buried.

friar lawrence.
peace, ho, for shame. confusion’s cure lives [[life]] not
in these confusions. [[heaven]] and yourself
had part in this [[fair]] maid, now [[heaven]] hath all,
and all the [[better]] is it for the maid.
your part in her you could not keep from [[death]],
but [[heaven]] keeps his part in eternal [[life]].
the most you sought was her promotion,
for ’twas your [[heaven]] she should be advanc’d,
and weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d
above the clouds, as high as [[heaven]] itself?
o, in this [[love]], you [[love]] your child so ill
that you run mad, seeing that she is well.
she’s not well [[married]] that lives [[life]] [[married]] long,
but she’s [[best]] [[married]] that dies [[married]] [[young]].
dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
on this [[fair]] corse, and, as the custom is,
and in her [[best]] array bear her to [[church]];
for though fond [[nature]] bids us all lament,
yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.

capulet.
all things that we ordained festival
turn from their office to black [[funeral]]:
our instruments to melancholy bells,
our wedding cheer to a [[sad]] burial feast;
our solemn hymns to sullen dirges [[change]];
our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
and all things [[change]] them to the contrary.

friar lawrence.
sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
and go, sir [[paris]], everyone prepare
to [[follow]] this [[fair]] corse unto her grave.
the heavens [[heaven]] do lower upon you for some ill;
move them no more by crossing their high will.

faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.

musicians, o, musicians, ‘heart’s ease,’ ‘heart’s ease’, o, and you
will have me [[live]], play ‘heart’s ease.’

first musician.
why ‘heart’s ease’?

peter.
o musicians, because my [[heart]] itself plays ‘my [[heart]] is full’. o play
me some merry dump to comfort me.

first musician.
not a dump we, ’tis no [[time]] to play now.

peter.
you will not then?

first musician.
no.

peter.
i will then give it you soundly.

first musician.
what will you give us?

peter.
no [[money]], on my [[faith]], but the gleek! i will give you the minstrel.

first musician.
then will i give you the serving-creature.

peter.
then will i lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. i will
carry no crotchets. i’ll re you, i’ll fa you. do you note me?

first musician.
and you re us and fa us, you note us.

second musician.
pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

peter.
then have at you with my wit. i will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and
put up my iron dagger. [[answer]] me like [[men]].
    ‘when griping griefs the [[heart]] doth wound,
      and doleful dumps the [[mind]] [[oppress]],
    then [[music]] with her silver sound’—
why ‘silver sound’? why ‘music with her silver sound’? what say you,
simon catling?

first musician.
marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

peter.
prates. what say you, hugh rebeck?

second musician.
i say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.

peter.
prates too! what say you, james soundpost?

third musician.
faith, i [[know]] not what to say.

peter.
o, i cry you [[mercy]], you are the singer. i will say for you. it is
‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for
sounding.
      ‘then [[music]] with her silver sound
      with speedy [[help]] doth lend redress.’

act v

scene i. mantua. a street.

 enter romeo.

romeo.
if i may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
my dreams [[dream]] presage some joyful news at hand.
my bosom’s [[lord]] sits lightly in his [[throne]];
and all this day an unaccustom’d spirit
lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts [[thought]].
i dreamt my [[lady]] came and found me [[dead]],—
strange [[dream]], that gives a [[dead]] [[man]] leave to think!—
and breath’d such [[life]] with kisses in my lips,
that i reviv’d, and was an [[emperor]].
ah me, how sweet is [[love]] itself possess’d,
when but love’s shadows are so [[rich]] in joy.

 enter balthasar.

news from verona! how now, balthasar?
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
how doth my [[lady]]? is my [[father]] well?
how fares my juliet? that i ask again;
for nothing can be ill if she be well.

balthasar.
then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
her [[body]] sleeps in capel’s monument,
and her [[immortal]] part with angels lives [[life]].
i saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,
and presently took post to tell it you.
o pardon me for bringing these ill news,
since you did leave it for my office, sir.

romeo.
is it even so? then i defy you, stars!
thou know’st my lodging. get me ink and paper,
and hire post-horses. i will hence tonight.

balthasar.
i do beseech you sir, have patience.
your looks are pale and wild, and do import
some misadventure.

romeo.
tush, thou art [[arts]] deceiv’d.
leave me, and do the thing i bid thee do.
hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

balthasar.
no, my [[good]] [[lord]].

romeo.
no matter. get thee gone,
and hire those horses. i’ll be with thee straight.

 [_exit balthasar._]

well, juliet, i will [[lie]] with thee tonight.
let’s see for means. o mischief thou art [[arts]] swift
to enter in the thoughts [[thought]] of desperate [[men]].
i do [[remember]] an apothecary,—
and hereabouts he dwells,—which late i noted
in tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,
culling of simples, meagre were his looks,
sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
and in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
an alligator stuff’d, and other skins
of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
a beggarly account of empty boxes,
green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.
noting this penury, to myself i said,
and if a [[man]] did need a poison now,
whose sale is [[present]] [[death]] in mantua,
here lives [[life]] a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
o, this same [[thought]] did but forerun my need,
and this same needy [[man]] must sell it me.
as i [[remember]], this should be the house.
being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.
what, ho! apothecary!

 enter apothecary.

apothecary.
who calls so loud?

romeo.
come hither, [[man]]. i see that thou art [[arts]] [[poor]].
hold, there is forty ducats. let me have
a dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
as will disperse itself through all the veins,
that the life-weary taker may fall [[dead]],
and that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath
as violently as hasty powder fir’d
doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.

apothecary.
such mortal drugs i have, but mantua’s law
is [[death]] to any he that utters them.

romeo.
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
and fear’st to [[die]]? famine is in thy cheeks,
need and oppression starveth in thine [[eyes]],
contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.
the [[world]] is not thy friend, nor the world’s [[law]];
the [[world]] affords no [[law]] to make thee [[rich]];
then be not [[poor]], but break it and take this.

apothecary.
my [[poverty]], but not my will consents.

romeo.
i [[pay]] thy [[poverty]], and not thy will.

apothecary.
put this in any liquid thing you will
and drink it off; and, if you had the strength
of twenty [[men]], it would despatch you straight.

romeo.
there is thy gold, worse poison to [[men’s]] souls [[soul]],
doing more murder in this loathsome world
than these [[poor]] compounds that thou mayst not sell.
i sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
come, cordial and not poison, go with me
to juliet’s grave, for there must i use thee.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. friar lawrence’s cell.

 enter friar john.

friar john.
holy franciscan friar! [[brother]], ho!

 enter friar lawrence.

friar lawrence.
this same should be the voice of friar john.
welcome from mantua. what says romeo?
or, if his [[mind]] be writ, give me his letter.

friar john.
going to find a barefoot [[brother]] out,
one of our order, to associate me,
here in this [[city]] visiting the sick,
and finding him, the searchers of the town,
suspecting that we both were in a house
where the infectious pestilence did reign,
seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,
so that my speed to mantua there was stay’d.

friar lawrence.
who bare my letter then to romeo?

friar john.
i could not send it,—here it is again,—
nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
so fearful were they of infection.

friar lawrence.
unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
the letter was not nice, but full of charge,
of dear import, and the neglecting it
may do much danger. friar john, go hence,
get me an iron crow and bring it straight
unto my cell.

friar john.
brother, i’ll go and bring it thee.

 [_exit._]

friar lawrence.
now must i to the monument alone.
within this three hours will [[fair]] juliet wake.
she will beshrew me much that romeo
hath had no notice of these accidents;
but i will write again to mantua,
and keep her at my cell till romeo come.
poor living corse, clos’d in a [[dead]] man’s tomb.

 [_exit._]

scene iii. a churchyard; in it a monument belonging to the capulets.

 enter [[paris]], and his page bearing flowers and a torch.

paris.
give me thy torch, boy. hence and stand aloof.
yet put it out, for i would not be seen.
under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
holding thy ear close to the hollow ground;
so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
but thou shalt hear it. whistle then to me,
as signal that thou hear’st something approach.
give me those flowers. do as i bid thee, go.

page.
[_aside._] i am almost afraid to stand alone
here in the churchyard; yet i will adventure.

 [_retires._]

paris.
sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed i strew.
o woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,
which with sweet water nightly i will dew,
or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.
the obsequies that i for thee will keep,
nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

 [_the page whistles._]

the boy gives warning something doth approach.
what cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
to cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
what, with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

 [_retires._]

 enter romeo and balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.

romeo.
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
hold, take this letter; early in the morning
see thou deliver it to my [[lord]] and [[father]].
give me the [[light]]; upon thy [[life]] i charge thee,
whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof
and do not interrupt me in my course.
why i descend into this bed of death
is partly to behold my lady’s face,
but chiefly to take thence from her [[dead]] finger
a precious ring, a ring that i must use
in dear employment. therefore hence, be gone.
but if thou [[jealous]] dost return to pry
in what i further shall intend to do,
by [[heaven]] i will tear thee joint by joint,
and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
the [[time]] and my intents are savage-wild;
more fierce and more inexorable far
than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

balthasar.
i will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

romeo.
so shalt thou show me [[friendship]]. take thou that.
live, and be prosperous, and farewell, [[good]] fellow.

balthasar.
for all this same, i’ll hide me hereabout.
his looks i [[fear]], and his intents i [[doubt]].

 [_retires_]

romeo.
thou detestable maw, thou womb of [[death]],
gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the [[earth]],
thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open,

 [_breaking open the door of the monument._]

and in despite, i’ll cram thee with more food.

paris.
this is that banish’d haughty montague
that murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which [[grief]],
it is supposed, the [[fair]] creature died,—
and here is come to do some villanous shame
to the [[dead]] bodies [[body]]. i will apprehend him.

 [_advances._]

stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile montague.
can vengeance be pursu’d further than [[death]]?
condemned villain, i do apprehend thee.
obey, and go with me, for thou must [[die]].

romeo.
i must indeed; and therefore came i hither.
good gentle [[youth]], tempt not a desperate [[man]].
fly hence and leave me. [[think]] upon these gone;
let them affright thee. i beseech thee, [[youth]],
put not another [[sin]] upon my head
by urging me to fury. o be gone.
by [[heaven]] i [[love]] thee [[better]] than myself;
for i come hither arm’d against myself.
stay not, be gone, [[live]], and hereafter say,
a madman’s [[mercy]] bid thee run away.

paris.
i do defy thy conjuration,
and apprehend thee for a felon here.

romeo.
wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

 [_they [[fight]]._]

page.
o [[lord]], they fight! i will go call the watch.

 [_exit._]

paris.
o, i am slain! [_falls._] if thou be merciful,
open the tomb, lay me with juliet.

 [_dies._]

romeo.
in [[faith]], i will. let me peruse this face.
mercutio’s kinsman, [[noble]] county paris!
what said my [[man]], when my betossed soul
did not attend him as we rode? i think
he told me [[paris]] should have [[married]] juliet.
said he not so? or did i [[dream]] it so?
or am i mad, hearing him talk of juliet,
to [[think]] it was so? o, give me thy hand,
one writ with me in sour misfortune’s [[book]].
i’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
a grave? o no, a lantern, slaught’red [[youth]],
for here lies [[lie]] juliet, and her [[beauty]] makes
this vault a feasting presence full of [[light]].
death, [[lie]] thou there, by a [[dead]] [[man]] interr’d.

 [_laying [[paris]] in the monument._]

how oft when [[men]] are at the point of death
have they been merry! which their keepers call
a lightning before [[death]]. o, how may i
call this a lightning? o my [[love]], my [[wife]],
death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
hath had no [[power]] yet upon thy [[beauty]].
thou art [[arts]] not conquer’d. beauty’s ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
and death’s pale flag is not advanced there.
tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
o, what more favour can i do to thee
than with that hand that cut thy [[youth]] in twain
to sunder his that was thine [[enemy]]?
forgive me, cousin. ah, dear juliet,
why art [[arts]] thou yet so [[fair]]? shall i believe
that unsubstantial [[death]] is amorous;
and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
thee here in dark to be his paramour?
for [[fear]] of that i still will stay with thee,
and never from this palace of dim night
depart again. here, here will i remain
with worms that are thy chambermaids. o, here
will i set up my everlasting rest;
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh. [[eyes]], look your [[last]].
arms, take your [[last]] embrace! and, lips, o you
the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
a dateless bargain to engrossing [[death]].
come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.
thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
the dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.
here’s to my love! [_drinks._] o true apothecary!
thy drugs are quick. thus with a kiss i [[die]].

 [_dies._]

 enter, at the other end of the churchyard, friar lawrence, with a
 lantern, crow, and spade.

friar lawrence.
saint francis be my speed. how oft tonight
have my old feet stumbled at graves? who’s there?
who is it that consorts, so late, the [[dead]]?

balthasar.
here’s one, a friend, and one that knows [[know]] you well.

friar lawrence.
bliss be upon you. tell me, [[good]] my friend,
what torch is yond that vainly lends his light
to grubs and eyeless skulls? as i discern,
it burneth in the capels’ monument.

balthasar.
it doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,
one that you [[love]].

friar lawrence.
who is it?

balthasar.
romeo.

friar lawrence.
how long hath he been there?

balthasar.
full half an hour.

friar lawrence.
go with me to the vault.

balthasar.
i dare not, sir;
my master knows [[know]] not but i am gone hence,
and fearfully did menace me with death
if i did stay to look on his intents.

friar lawrence.
stay then, i’ll go alone. [[fear]] comes upon me.
o, much i [[fear]] some ill unlucky thing.

balthasar.
as i did sleep under this yew tree here,
i dreamt my master and another fought,
and that my master slew him.

friar lawrence.
romeo! [_advances._]
alack, alack, what [[blood]] is this which stains
the stony entrance of this sepulchre?
what mean these masterless and gory swords
to [[lie]] discolour’d by this place of [[peace]]?

 [_enters the monument._]

romeo! o, pale! who else? what, [[paris]] too?
and steep’d in [[blood]]? ah what an unkind hour
is guilty of this lamentable [[chance]]?
the [[lady]] stirs.

 [_juliet wakes and stirs._]

juliet.
o comfortable friar, where is my [[lord]]?
i do [[remember]] well where i should be,
and there i am. where is my romeo?

 [_noise within._]

friar lawrence.
i hear some noise. [[lady]], come from that nest
of [[death]], contagion, and unnatural sleep.
a greater [[power]] than we can contradict
hath thwarted our intents. come, come away.
thy husband in thy bosom there lies [[lie]] [[dead]];
and [[paris]] too. come, i’ll dispose of thee
among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
stay not to [[question]], for the watch is coming.
come, go, [[good]] juliet. i dare no longer stay.

juliet.
go, get thee hence, for i will not away.

 [_exit friar lawrence._]

what’s here? a cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
poison, i see, hath been his timeless end.
o churl. drink all, and left no friendly drop
to [[help]] me after? i will kiss thy lips.
haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
to make me [[die]] with a restorative.

 [_kisses him._]

thy lips are warm!

first watch.
[_within._] lead, boy. which way?

juliet.
yea, noise? then i’ll be brief. o [[happy]] dagger.

 [_snatching romeo’s dagger._]

this is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] there rest, and let me [[die]].

 [_falls on romeo’s [[body]] and dies._]

 enter watch with the page of [[paris]].

page.
this is the place. there, where the torch doth burn.

first watch.
the ground is bloody. search about the churchyard.
go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.

 [_exeunt some of the watch._]

pitiful sight! here lies [[lie]] the county slain,
and juliet bleeding, warm, and newly [[dead]],
who here hath lain this two days buried.
go tell the [[prince]]; run to the capulets.
raise up the montagues, some others search.

 [_exeunt others of the watch._]

we see the ground whereon these woes do [[lie]],
but the true ground of all these piteous woes
we cannot without circumstance descry.

 re-enter some of the watch with balthasar.

second watch.
here’s romeo’s [[man]]. we found him in the churchyard.

first watch.
hold him in safety till the [[prince]] come hither.

 re-enter others of the watch with friar lawrence.

third watch. here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
we took this mattock and this spade from him
as he was coming from this churchyard side.

first watch.
a [[great]] suspicion. stay the friar too.

 enter the [[prince]] and attendants.

prince.
what misadventure is so early up,
that calls our [[person]] from our morning’s rest?

 enter capulet, [[lady]] capulet and others.

capulet.
what should it be that they so shriek abroad?

lady capulet.
o the [[people]] in the street cry romeo,
some juliet, and some [[paris]], and all run
with open outcry toward our monument.

prince.
what [[fear]] is this which startles in our ears?

first watch.
sovereign, here lies [[lie]] the county [[paris]] slain,
and romeo [[dead]], and juliet, [[dead]] before,
warm and new kill’d.

prince.
search, seek, and [[know]] how this foul murder comes.

first watch.
here is a friar, and slaughter’d romeo’s [[man]],
with instruments upon them fit to open
these [[dead]] [[men’s]] tombs.

capulet.
o heaven! o [[wife]], look how our [[daughter]] bleeds!
this dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house
is empty on the back of montague,
and it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.

lady capulet.
o me! this sight of [[death]] is as a bell
that warns my old [[age]] to a sepulchre.

 enter montague and others.

prince.
come, montague, for thou art [[arts]] early up,
to see thy [[son]] and heir more early down.

montague.
alas, my liege, my [[wife]] is [[dead]] tonight.
grief of my son’s [[exile]] hath stopp’d her breath.
what further woe conspires against mine [[age]]?

prince.
look, and thou shalt see.

montague.
o thou untaught! what manners is in this,
to press before thy [[father]] to a grave?

prince.
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
till we can clear these ambiguities,
and [[know]] their spring, their head, their true descent,
and then will i be general of your woes,
and lead you even to [[death]]. meantime forbear,
and let mischance be [[slave]] to patience.
bring forth the parties of suspicion.

friar lawrence.
i am the [[greatest]], able to do least,
yet most suspected, as the [[time]] and place
doth make against me, of this direful murder.
and here i stand, both to impeach and purge
myself condemned and myself excus’d.

prince.
then say at once what thou dost [[know]] in this.

friar lawrence.
i will be brief, for my short date of breath
is not so long as is a tedious tale.
romeo, there [[dead]], was husband to that juliet,
and she, there [[dead]], that romeo’s faithful [[wife]].
i [[married]] them; and their stol’n [[marriage]] day
was tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this [[city]];
for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pin’d.
you, to remove that siege of [[grief]] from her,
betroth’d, and would have [[married]] her perforce
to county [[paris]]. then comes she to me,
and with wild looks, bid me devise some means
to rid her from this second [[marriage]],
or in my cell there would she kill herself.
then gave i her, so tutored by my art [[arts]],
a sleeping potion, which so took effect
as i intended, for it wrought on her
the form of [[death]]. meantime i writ to romeo
that he should hither come as this dire night
to [[help]] to take her from her borrow’d grave,
being the [[time]] the potion’s [[force]] should cease.
but he which bore my letter, friar john,
was stay’d by accident; and yesternight
return’d my letter back. then all alone
at the prefixed hour of her waking
came i to take her from her kindred’s vault,
meaning to keep her closely at my cell
till i conveniently could send to romeo.
but when i came, some minute ere the time
of her awaking, here untimely lay
the [[noble]] [[paris]] and true romeo [[dead]].
she wakes; and i entreated her come forth
and bear this [[work]] of [[heaven]] with patience.
but then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
and she, too desperate, would not go with me,
but, as it seems, did [[violence]] on herself.
all this i [[know]]; and to the marriage
her nurse is privy. and if ought in this
miscarried by my [[fault]], let my old life
be sacrific’d, some hour before his [[time]],
unto the rigour of severest [[law]].

prince.
we still have known thee for a holy [[man]].
where’s romeo’s [[man]]? what can he say to this?

balthasar.
i brought my master news of juliet’s [[death]],
and then in post he came from mantua
to this same place, to this same monument.
this letter he early bid me give his [[father]],
and threaten’d me with [[death]], going in the vault,
if i departed not, and left him there.

prince.
give me the letter, i will look on it.
where is the county’s page that rais’d the watch?
sirrah, what made your master in this place?

page.
he came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
and bid me stand aloof, and so i did.
anon comes one with [[light]] to ope the tomb,
and by and by my master drew on him,
and then i ran away to call the watch.

prince.
this letter doth make [[good]] the friar’s words,
their course of [[love]], the tidings of her [[death]].
and here he writes that he did buy a poison
of a [[poor]] ’pothecary, and therewithal
came to this vault to [[die]], and [[lie]] with juliet.
where be these enemies [[enemy]]? capulet, montague,
see what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
that [[heaven]] finds means to kill your joys with love!
and i, for winking at your discords too,
have lost a brace of kinsmen. all are punish’d.

capulet.
o [[brother]] montague, give me thy hand.
this is my daughter’s jointure, for no more
can i demand.

montague.
but i can give thee more,
for i will raise her statue in pure gold,
that whiles verona by that name is known,
there shall no figure at such rate be set
as that of true and faithful juliet.

capulet.
as [[rich]] shall romeo’s by his lady’s [[lie]],
poor sacrifices [[sacrifice]] of our enmity.

prince.
a glooming [[peace]] this morning with it brings;
the sun for [[sorrow]] will not show his head.
go hence, to have more talk of these [[sad]] things.
some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,
for never was a story of more woe
than this of juliet and her romeo.

 [_exeunt._]
