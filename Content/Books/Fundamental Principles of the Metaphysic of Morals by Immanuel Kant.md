preface



ancient [[greek]] [[philosophy]] was divided into three sciences [[science]]: physics,
ethics, and [[logic]]. this division is perfectly suitable to the nature
of the thing; and the only improvement that can be made in it is to
add the [[principle]] on which it is based, so that we may both satisfy
ourselves of its completeness, and also be able to determine correctly
the necessary subdivisions.

all [[rational]] [[knowledge]] is either material or formal: the former
considers some object, the latter is concerned only with the form of
the understanding and of the [[reason]] itself, and with the universal
laws of [[thought]] in general without distinction of its objects.
formal [[philosophy]] is called [[logic]]. material [[philosophy]], however, which has
to do with determinate objects and the laws [[law]] to which they are [[subject]],
is again twofold; for these laws [[law]] are either laws [[law]] of [[nature]] or of
freedom. the [[science]] of the former is physics, that of the latter,
ethics; they are also called [[natural]] [[philosophy]] and [[moral]] philosophy
respectively.

logic cannot have any empirical part; that is, a part in which the
universal and necessary laws [[law]] of [[thought]] should rest on grounds taken
from [[experience]]; otherwise it would not be [[logic]], i.e., a canon for
the understanding or the [[reason]], valid for all [[thought]], and capable of
demonstration. [[natural]] and [[moral]] [[philosophy]], on the contrary, can each
have their empirical part, since the former has to determine the
laws of [[nature]] as an object of [[experience]]; the latter the laws [[law]] of
the [[human]] will, so far as it is affected by [[nature]]: the former,
however, being laws [[law]] according to which everything does happen; the
latter, laws [[law]] according to which everything ought to happen. ethics,
however, must also consider the conditions under which what ought to
happen frequently does not.

we may call all [[philosophy]] empirical, so far as it is based on
grounds of [[experience]]: on the other hand, that which delivers its
doctrines from a priori principles [[principle]] alone we may call pure
philosophy. when the latter is merely formal it is [[logic]]; if it is
restricted to definite objects of the understanding it is metaphysic.

in this way there arises the [[idea]] of a twofold metaphysic- a
metaphysic of [[nature]] and a metaphysic of morals [[moral]]. physics will thus
have an empirical and also a [[rational]] part. it is the same with
ethics; but here the empirical part might have the special name of
practical anthropology, the name morality being appropriated to the
rational part.

all trades [[trade]], [[arts]], and handiworks have gained by division of
labour, namely, when, instead of one [[man]] doing everything, each
confines himself to a [[certain]] [[kind]] of [[work]] distinct from others in the
treatment it requires, so as to be able to perform it with greater
facility and in the [[greatest]] [[perfection]]. where the different kinds
of [[work]] are not distinguished and divided, where everyone is a
jack-of-all-trades, there manufactures remain still in the greatest
barbarism. it might deserve to be considered whether pure philosophy
in all its parts does not require a [[man]] specially devoted to it, and
whether it would not be [[better]] for the whole [[business]] of [[science]] if
those who, to please the tastes of the [[public]], are wont to blend the
rational and empirical elements together, mixed in all sorts of
proportions unknown to themselves, and who call themselves independent
thinkers, giving the name of minute [[philosophers]] to those who apply
themselves to the [[rational]] part only- if these, i say, were warned not
to carry on two employments together which differ widely in the
treatment they demand, for each of which perhaps a special talent is
required, and the combination of which in one [[person]] only produces
bunglers. but i only ask here whether the [[nature]] of [[science]] does not
require that we should always carefully separate the empirical from
the [[rational]] part, and prefix to physics proper (or empirical physics)
a metaphysic of [[nature]], and to practical anthropology a metaphysic
of morals [[moral]], which must be carefully cleared of everything empirical, so
that we may [[know]] how much can be accomplished by pure [[reason]] in both
cases, and from what sources it draws this its a priori teaching,
and that whether the latter inquiry is conducted by all moralists
(whose name is legion), or only by some who [[feel]] a calling thereto.

as my concern here is with [[moral]] [[philosophy]], i limit the question
suggested to this: whether it is not of the utmost necessity to
construct a pure thing which is only empirical and which belongs to
anthropology? for that such a [[philosophy]] must be possible is evident
from the [[common]] [[idea]] of [[duty]] and of the [[moral]] laws [[law]]. everyone must
admit that if a [[law]] is to have [[moral]] [[force]], i.e., to be the basis of
an obligation, it must carry with it absolute necessity; that, for
example, the precept, "thou shalt not [[lie]]," is not valid for men
alone, as if other [[rational]] beings had no need to observe it; and so
with all the other [[moral]] laws [[law]] properly so called; that, therefore, the
basis of obligation must not be sought in the [[nature]] of [[man]], or in the
circumstances in the [[world]] in which he is placed, but a priori
simply in the conception of pure [[reason]]; and although any other
precept which is founded on principles [[principle]] of mere [[experience]] may be in
certain respects [[respect]] universal, yet in as far as it rests even in the
least [[degree]] on an empirical basis, perhaps only as to a motive,
such a precept, while it may be a practical [[rule]], can never be
called a [[moral]] [[law]].

thus not only are [[moral]] laws [[law]] with their principles [[principle]] essentially
distinguished from every other [[kind]] of practical [[knowledge]] in which
there is anything empirical, but all [[moral]] [[philosophy]] rests wholly
on its pure part. when applied to [[man]], it does not borrow the least
thing from the [[knowledge]] of [[man]] himself (anthropology), but gives laws
a priori to him as a [[rational]] being. no [[doubt]] these laws [[law]] require a
judgement sharpened by [[experience]], in order on the one hand to
distinguish in what cases they are applicable, and on the other to
procure for them access to the will of the [[man]] and effectual influence
on conduct; since [[man]] is acted on by so many inclinations that, though
capable of the [[idea]] of a practical pure [[reason]], he is not so easily
able to make it effective in concreto in his [[life]].

a metaphysic of morals [[moral]] is therefore indispensably necessary, not
merely for speculative reasons [[reason]], in order to investigate the sources of
the practical principles [[principle]] which are to be found a priori in our [[reason]],
but also because morals [[moral]] themselves are liable to all sorts of
corruption, as long as we are without that clue and supreme canon by
which to estimate them correctly. for in order that an action should
be morally [[good]], it is not enough that it conform to the [[moral]] [[law]],
but it must also be done for the sake of the [[law]], otherwise that
conformity is only very contingent and uncertain; since a principle
which is not [[moral]], although it may now and then [[produce]] actions
conformable to the [[law]], will also often [[produce]] actions which
contradict it. now it is only in a pure [[philosophy]] that we can look for
the [[moral]] [[law]] in its purity and genuineness (and, in a practical
matter, this is of the utmost consequence): we must, therefore,
begin with pure [[philosophy]] (metaphysic), and without it there cannot
be any [[moral]] [[philosophy]] at all. that which mingles these pure
principles with the empirical does not deserve the name of
philosophy (for what distinguishes [[philosophy]] from [[common]] rational
knowledge is that it treats in separate sciences [[science]] what the latter
only comprehends confusedly); much less does it deserve that of
moral [[philosophy]], since by this confusion it even spoils the purity of
morals themselves, and counteracts its own end.

let it not be [[thought]], however, that what is here demanded is
already extant in the propaedeutic prefixed by the celebrated wolf
to his [[moral]] [[philosophy]], namely, his so-called general practical
philosophy, and that, therefore, we have not to strike into an
entirely new field. just because it was to be a general practical
philosophy, it has not taken into consideration a will of any
particular kind- say one which should be determined solely from a
priori principles [[principle]] without any empirical motives, and which we might
call a pure will, but volition in general, with all the actions and
conditions which belong to it in this general signification. by this
it is distinguished from a metaphysic of morals [[moral]], just as general
logic, which treats of the acts and canons of [[thought]] in general, is
distinguished from transcendental [[philosophy]], which treats of the
particular acts and canons of pure [[thought]], i.e., that whose
cognitions are altogether a priori. for the metaphysic of morals [[moral]] has
to examine the [[idea]] and the principles [[principle]] of a possible pure will, and
not the acts and conditions of [[human]] volition generally, which for the
most part are drawn from psychology. it is true that [[moral]] laws [[law]] and
duty are spoken of in the general [[moral]] [[philosophy]] (contrary indeed to
all fitness). but this is no objection, for in this [[respect]] also the
authors of that [[science]] remain true to their [[idea]] of it; they do not
distinguish the motives which are prescribed as such by [[reason]] alone
altogether a priori, and which are properly [[moral]], from the
empirical motives which the understanding raises to general
conceptions merely by comparison of experiences; but, without noticing
the difference of their sources, and looking on them all as
homogeneous, they consider only their greater or less amount. it is in
this way they frame their notion of obligation, which, though anything
but [[moral]], is all that can be attained in a [[philosophy]] which passes no
judgement at all on the origin of all possible practical concepts,
whether they are a priori, or only a posteriori.

intending to publish hereafter a metaphysic of morals [[moral]], i issue in
the first instance these fundamental principles [[principle]]. indeed there is
properly no other foundation for it than the critical examination of a
pure practical [[reason]]; just as that of metaphysics is the critical
examination of the pure speculative [[reason]], already published. but
in the first place the former is not so absolutely necessary as the
latter, because in [[moral]] concerns [[human]] [[reason]] can easily be brought
to a high [[degree]] of correctness and completeness, even in the
commonest understanding, while on the contrary in its theoretic but
pure use it is wholly dialectical; and in the second place if the
critique of a pure practical [[reason]] is to be complete, it must be
possible at the same [[time]] to show its identity with the speculative
reason in a [[common]] [[principle]], for it can ultimately be only one and
the same [[reason]] which has to be distinguished merely in its
application. i could not, however, bring it to such completeness here,
without introducing considerations of a wholly different [[kind]], which
would be perplexing to the reader. on this account i have adopted
the title of fundamental principles [[principle]] of the metaphysic of morals
instead of that of a critical examination of the pure practical
reason.

but in the third place, since a metaphysic of morals [[moral]], in spite of
the discouraging title, is yet capable of being presented in popular
form, and one adapted to the [[common]] understanding, i find it useful to
separate from it this preliminary treatise on its fundamental
principles, in order that i may not hereafter have need to introduce
these necessarily subtle discussions into a [[book]] of a more simple
character.

the [[present]] treatise is, however, nothing more than the
investigation and establishment of the supreme [[principle]] of
morality, and this alone constitutes a study complete in itself and
one which ought to be kept apart from every other [[moral]] investigation.
no [[doubt]] my conclusions on this weighty [[question]], which has hitherto
been very unsatisfactorily examined, would receive much [[light]] from the
application of the same [[principle]] to the whole [[system]], and would be
greatly confirmed by the adequacy which it exhibits throughout; but
i must forego this advantage, which indeed would be after all more
gratifying than useful, since the easy applicability of a principle
and its apparent adequacy give no very [[certain]] proof of its soundness,
but rather inspire a [[certain]] partiality, which prevents us from
examining and estimating it strictly in itself and without regard to
consequences.

i have adopted in this [[work]] the method which i [[think]] most
suitable, proceeding analytically from [[common]] [[knowledge]] to the
determination of its ultimate [[principle]], and again descending
synthetically from the examination of this [[principle]] and its sources
to the [[common]] [[knowledge]] in which we find it employed. the division
will, therefore, be as follows:



1 first section. transition from the [[common]] [[rational]] [[knowledge]] of
morality to the philosophical.



2 second section. transition from popular [[moral]] [[philosophy]] to the
metaphysic of morals [[moral]].



3 third section. final step from the metaphysic of morals [[moral]] to the
critique of the pure practical [[reason]].

nothing can possibly be conceived in the [[world]], or even out of it,
which can be called [[good]], without qualification, except a [[good]] will.
intelligence, wit, judgement, and the other [[talents]] of the [[mind]],
however they may be named, or [[courage]], resolution, perseverance, as
qualities of temperament, are undoubtedly [[good]] and desirable in many
respects; but these gifts of [[nature]] may also become extremely bad
and mischievous if the will which is to make use of them, and which,
therefore, constitutes what is called [[character]], is not [[good]]. it is
the same with the gifts of [[fortune]]. [[power]], riches [[rich]], [[honour]], even
health, and the general well-being and contentment with one's
condition which is called [[happiness]], inspire [[pride]], and often
presumption, if there is not a [[good]] will to [[correct]] the influence of
these on the [[mind]], and with this also to rectify the whole principle
of acting and adapt it to its end. the sight of a being who is not
adorned with a [[single]] feature of a pure and [[good]] will, enjoying
unbroken [[prosperity]], can never give [[pleasure]] to an impartial
rational spectator. thus a [[good]] will appears to constitute the
indispensable condition even of being worthy of [[happiness]].

there are even some qualities which are of service to this [[good]] will
itself and may facilitate its action, yet which have no intrinsic
unconditional value, but always presuppose a [[good]] will, and this
qualifies the esteem that we justly have for them and does not
permit us to regard them as absolutely [[good]]. moderation in the
affections and [[passions]], self-control, and calm deliberation are not
only [[good]] in many respects [[respect]], but even seem to constitute part of the
intrinsic worth of the [[person]]; but they are far from deserving to be
called [[good]] without qualification, although they have been so
unconditionally praised by the ancients. for without the principles [[principle]] of
a [[good]] will, they may become extremely [[bad]], and the coolness of a
villain not only makes him far more dangerous, but also directly makes
him more abominable in our [[eyes]] than he would have been without it.

a [[good]] will is [[good]] not because of what it performs or effects,
not by its aptness for the attainment of some proposed end, but simply
by [[virtue]] of the volition; that is, it is [[good]] in itself, and
considered by itself is to be esteemed much higher than all that can
be brought about by it in favour of any inclination, nay even of the
sum total of all inclinations. even if it should happen that, owing to
special disfavour of [[fortune]], or the niggardly provision of a
step-motherly [[nature]], this will should wholly lack [[power]] to accomplish
its [[purpose]], if with its [[greatest]] efforts it should yet achieve
nothing, and there should remain only the [[good]] will (not, to be
sure, a mere [[wish]], but the summoning of all means in our power), then,
like a jewel, it would still shine by its own [[light]], as a thing
which has its whole value in itself. its usefulness or fruitlessness
can neither add nor take away anything from this value. it would be,
as it were, only the setting to enable us to handle it the more
conveniently in [[common]] commerce, or to attract to it the attention
of those who are not yet connoisseurs, but not to recommend it to true
connoisseurs, or to determine its value.

there is, however, something so [[strange]] in this [[idea]] of the absolute
value of the mere will, in which no account is taken of its utility,
that notwithstanding the thorough assent of even [[common]] [[reason]] to
the [[idea]], yet a suspicion must arise that it may perhaps really be the
product of mere high-flown fancy, and that we may have misunderstood
the [[purpose]] of [[nature]] in assigning [[reason]] as the governor of our will.
therefore we will examine this [[idea]] from this point of view.

in the physical [[constitution]] of an organized being, that is, a being
adapted suitably to the purposes [[purpose]] of [[life]], we assume it as a
fundamental [[principle]] that no organ for any [[purpose]] will be found
but what is also the fittest and [[best]] adapted for that [[purpose]]. now in
a being which has [[reason]] and a will, if the proper object of nature
were its conservation, its welfare, in a word, its [[happiness]], then
nature would have hit upon a very [[bad]] arrangement in selecting the
reason of the creature to carry out this [[purpose]]. for all the
actions which the creature has to perform with a view to this [[purpose]],
and the whole [[rule]] of its conduct, would be far more surely prescribed
to it by instinct, and that end would have been attained thereby
much more certainly than it ever can be by [[reason]]. should reason
have been communicated to this favoured creature over and above, it
must only have served it to contemplate the [[happy]] [[constitution]] of
its [[nature]], to [[admire]] it, to congratulate itself thereon, and to
feel thankful for it to the beneficent cause, but not that it should
subject its desires [[desire]] to that [[weak]] and delusive guidance and meddle
bunglingly with the [[purpose]] of [[nature]]. in a word, [[nature]] would have
taken [[care]] that [[reason]] should not break forth into practical exercise,
nor have the presumption, with its [[weak]] insight, to [[think]] out for
itself the plan of [[happiness]], and of the means of attaining it. nature
would not only have taken on herself the [[choice]] of the ends, but
also of the means, and with [[wise]] foresight would have entrusted both
to instinct.

and, in [[fact]], we find that the more a cultivated [[reason]] applies
itself with deliberate [[purpose]] to the enjoyment of [[life]] and [[happiness]],
so much the more does the [[man]] fail of true satisfaction. and from this
circumstance there arises in many, if they are candid enough to
confess it, a [[certain]] [[degree]] of misology, that is, [[hatred]] of [[reason]],
especially in the case of those who are most experienced in the use of
it, because after calculating all the advantages they derive, i do not
say from the invention of all the [[arts]] of [[common]] luxury, but even from
the sciences [[science]] (which seem to them to be after all only a luxury of
the understanding), they find that they have, in [[fact]], only brought
more trouble on their shoulders, rather than gained in [[happiness]];
and they end by envying, rather than despising, the more common
stamp of [[men]] who keep closer to the guidance of mere instinct and do
not allow their [[reason]] much influence on their conduct. and this we
must admit, that the judgement of those who would very much lower
the lofty eulogies of the advantages which [[reason]] gives us in regard
to the [[happiness]] and satisfaction of [[life]], or who would even reduce
them below zero, is by no means morose or ungrateful to the goodness
with which the [[world]] is governed, but that there lies [[lie]] at the root of
these judgements the [[idea]] that our existence has a different and far
nobler end, for which, and not for [[happiness]], [[reason]] is properly
intended, and which must, therefore, be regarded as the supreme
condition to which the private ends of [[man]] must, for the most part, be
postponed.

for as [[reason]] is not competent to guide the will with certainty in
regard to its objects and the satisfaction of all our wants (which
it to some extent even multiplies), this being an end to which an
implanted instinct would have [[led]] with much greater certainty; and
since, nevertheless, [[reason]] is imparted to us as a practical
faculty, i.e., as one which is to have influence on the will,
therefore, admitting that [[nature]] generally in the distribution of
her capacities has adapted the means to the end, its true
destination must be to [[produce]] a will, not merely [[good]] as a means to
something else, but [[good]] in itself, for which [[reason]] was absolutely
necessary. this will then, though not indeed the sole and complete
good, must be the supreme [[good]] and the condition of every other,
even of the [[desire]] of [[happiness]]. under these circumstances, there is
nothing inconsistent with the [[wisdom]] of [[nature]] in the [[fact]] that the
cultivation of the [[reason]], which is requisite for the first and
unconditional [[purpose]], does in many ways interfere, at least in this
life, with the attainment of the second, which is always
conditional, namely, [[happiness]]. nay, it may even reduce it to nothing,
without [[nature]] thereby failing of her [[purpose]]. for [[reason]] recognizes
the establishment of a [[good]] will as its highest practical destination,
and in attaining this [[purpose]] is capable only of a satisfaction of its
own proper [[kind]], namely that from the attainment of an end, which
end again is determined by [[reason]] only, notwithstanding that this
may involve many a disappointment to the ends of inclination.

we have then to develop the notion of a will which deserves to be
highly esteemed for itself and is [[good]] without a view to anything
further, a notion which exists already in the sound natural
understanding, requiring rather to be cleared up than to be taught,
and which in estimating the value of our actions always takes the
first place and constitutes the condition of all the rest. in order to
do this, we will take the notion of [[duty]], which includes that of a
good will, although implying [[certain]] subjective restrictions and
hindrances. these, however, far from concealing it, or rendering it
unrecognizable, rather bring it out by contrast and make it shine
forth so much the brighter.

i omit here all actions which are already recognized as inconsistent
with [[duty]], although they may be useful for this or that [[purpose]], for
with these the [[question]] whether they are done from [[duty]] cannot arise
at all, since they even conflict with it. i also set aside those
actions which really conform to [[duty]], but to which [[men]] have no
direct inclination, performing them because they are impelled
thereto by some other inclination. for in this case we can readily
distinguish whether the action which agrees with [[duty]] is done from
duty, or from a selfish view. it is much harder to make this
distinction when the action accords with [[duty]] and the [[subject]] has
besides a direct inclination to it. for [[example]], it is always a matter
of [[duty]] that a dealer should not over charge an inexperienced
purchaser; and wherever there is much commerce the prudent tradesman
does not overcharge, but keeps a fixed price for everyone, so that a
child buys of him as well as any other. [[men]] are thus honestly
served; but this is not enough to make us [[believe]] that the tradesman
has so acted from [[duty]] and from principles [[principle]] of honesty: his own
advantage required it; it is out of the [[question]] in this case to
suppose that he might besides have a direct inclination in favour of
the buyers, so that, as it were, from [[love]] he should give no advantage
to one over another. accordingly the action was done neither from duty
nor from direct inclination, but merely with a selfish view.

on the other hand, it is a [[duty]] to maintain one's [[life]]; and, in
addition, everyone has also a direct inclination to do so. but on this
account the often anxious [[care]] which most [[men]] take for it has no
intrinsic worth, and their [[maxim]] has no [[moral]] import. they preserve
their [[life]] as [[duty]] requires, no [[doubt]], but not because duty
requires. on the other hand, if adversity and hopeless [[sorrow]] have
completely taken away the relish for [[life]]; if the unfortunate one,
strong in [[mind]], indignant at his [[fate]] rather than desponding or
dejected, wishes [[wish]] for [[death]], and yet preserves his [[life]] without
loving it- not from inclination or [[fear]], but from duty- then his maxim
has a [[moral]] worth.

to be beneficent when we can is a [[duty]]; and besides this, there
are many minds [[mind]] so sympathetically constituted that, without any
other motive of vanity or self-interest, they find a [[pleasure]] in
spreading joy around them and can take delight in the satisfaction
of others so far as it is their own [[work]]. but i maintain that in
such a case an action of this [[kind]], however proper, however amiable it
may be, has nevertheless no true [[moral]] worth, but is on a level with
other inclinations, e.g., the inclination to [[honour]], which, if it is
happily directed to that which is in [[fact]] of [[public]] utility and
accordant with [[duty]] and consequently honourable, deserves [[praise]] and
encouragement, but not esteem. for the [[maxim]] lacks the [[moral]] import,
namely, that such actions be done from [[duty]], not from inclination. put
the case that the [[mind]] of that philanthropist were clouded by sorrow
of his own, extinguishing all sympathy with the lot of others, and
that, while he still has the [[power]] to benefit others in distress, he
is not touched by their trouble because he is absorbed with his own;
and now suppose that he tears himself out of this dead
insensibility, and performs the action without any inclination to
it, but simply from [[duty]], then first has his action its genuine
moral worth. further still; if [[nature]] has put little sympathy in the
heart of this or that [[man]]; if he, supposed to be an upright [[man]], is by
temperament cold and indifferent to the sufferings of others,
perhaps because in [[respect]] of his own he is provided with the
special gift of patience and fortitude and supposes, or even requires,
that others should have the same- and such a [[man]] would certainly not
be the meanest product of nature- but if [[nature]] had not specially
framed him for a philanthropist, would he not still find in himself
a source from whence to give himself a far higher worth than that of a
good-natured temperament could be? unquestionably. it is just in
this that the [[moral]] worth of the [[character]] is brought out which is
incomparably the highest of all, namely, that he is beneficent, not
from inclination, but from [[duty]].

to secure one's own [[happiness]] is a [[duty]], at least indirectly; for
discontent with one's condition, under a pressure of many anxieties
and amidst unsatisfied wants, might easily become a [[great]] temptation
to transgression of [[duty]]. but here again, without looking to [[duty]], all
men have already the strongest and most intimate inclination to
happiness, because it is just in this [[idea]] that all inclinations are
combined in one total. but the precept of [[happiness]] is often of such a
sort that it greatly interferes with some inclinations, and yet a
man cannot form any definite and [[certain]] conception of the sum of
satisfaction of all of them which is called [[happiness]]. it is not
then to be wondered at that a [[single]] inclination, definite both as
to what it promises and as to the [[time]] within which it can be
gratified, is often able to overcome such a fluctuating [[idea]], and that
a gouty patient, for instance, can choose to enjoy what he likes,
and to suffer what he may, since, according to his calculation, on
this [[occasion]] at least, he has not sacrificed the enjoyment of the
present moment to a possibly mistaken expectation of a [[happiness]] which
is supposed to be found in health. but even in this case, if the
general [[desire]] for [[happiness]] did not influence his will, and supposing
that in his particular case health was not a necessary element in this
calculation, there yet remains in this, as in all other cases, this
law, namely, that he should promote his [[happiness]] not from inclination
but from [[duty]], and by this would his conduct first acquire true
moral worth.

it is in this manner, undoubtedly, that we are to [[understand]] those
passages of [[scripture]] also in which we are commanded to [[love]] our
neighbour, even our [[enemy]]. for [[love]], as an affection, cannot be
commanded, but beneficence for duty's sake may; even though we are not
impelled to it by any inclination- nay, are even repelled by a natural
and unconquerable aversion. this is practical [[love]] and not
pathological- a [[love]] which is seated in the will, and not in the
propensions of sense- in principles [[principle]] of action and not of tender
sympathy; and it is this [[love]] alone which can be commanded.

the second proposition is: that an action done from [[duty]] derives its
moral worth, not from the [[purpose]] which is to be attained by it, but
from the [[maxim]] by which it is determined, and therefore does not
depend on the realization of the object of the action, but merely on
the [[principle]] of volition by which the action has taken place, without
regard to any object of [[desire]]. it is clear from what precedes that
the purposes [[purpose]] which we may have in view in our actions, or their
effects regarded as ends and springs of the will, cannot give to
actions any unconditional or [[moral]] worth. in what, then, can their
worth [[lie]], if it is not to consist in the will and in reference to its
expected effect? it cannot [[lie]] anywhere but in the [[principle]] of the
will without regard to the ends which can be attained by the action.
for the will stands between its a priori [[principle]], which is formal,
and its a posteriori spring, which is material, as between two roads,
and as it must be determined by something, it follows that it must be
determined by the formal [[principle]] of volition when an action is done
from [[duty]], in which case every material [[principle]] has been withdrawn
from it.

the third proposition, which is a consequence of the two
preceding, i would express thus: [[duty]] is the necessity of acting from
respect for the [[law]]. i may have inclination for an object as the
effect of my proposed action, but i cannot have [[respect]] for it, just
for this [[reason]], that it is an effect and not an energy of will.
similarly i cannot have [[respect]] for inclination, whether my own or
another's; i can at most, if my own, approve it; if another's,
sometimes even [[love]] it; i.e., look on it as favourable to my own
interest. it is only what is connected with my will as a [[principle]], by
no means as an effect- what does not subserve my inclination, but
overpowers it, or at least in case of [[choice]] excludes it from its
calculation- in other words, simply the [[law]] of itself, which can be an
object of [[respect]], and hence a command. now an action done from duty
must wholly exclude the influence of inclination and with it every
object of the will, so that nothing remains which can determine the
will except objectively the [[law]], and subjectively pure [[respect]] for
this practical [[law]], and consequently the [[maxim]] * that i should follow
this [[law]] even to the thwarting of all my inclinations.



* a [[maxim]] is the subjective [[principle]] of volition. the objective
principle (i.e., that which would also serve subjectively as a
practical [[principle]] to all [[rational]] beings if [[reason]] had full power
over the faculty of desire) is the practical [[law]].



thus the [[moral]] worth of an action does not [[lie]] in the effect
expected from it, nor in any [[principle]] of action which requires to
borrow its motive from this expected effect. for all these effects-
agreeableness of one's condition and even the promotion of the
happiness of others- could have been also brought about by other
causes, so that for this there would have been no need of the will
of a [[rational]] being; whereas it is in this alone that the supreme
and unconditional [[good]] can be found. the pre-eminent [[good]] which we
call [[moral]] can therefore consist in nothing else than the conception
of [[law]] in itself, which certainly is only possible in a rational
being, in so far as this conception, and not the expected effect,
determines the will. this is a [[good]] which is already [[present]] in the
person who acts accordingly, and we have not to wait for it to
appear first in the result. *



* it might be here objected to me that i take refuge behind the
word [[respect]] in an obscure feeling, instead of giving a distinct
solution of the [[question]] by a concept of the [[reason]]. but although
respect is a feeling, it is not a feeling received through
influence, but is self-wrought by a [[rational]] concept, and,
therefore, is specifically distinct from all feelings of the former
kind, which may be referred either to inclination or [[fear]], what i
recognise immediately as a [[law]] for me, i recognise with [[respect]].
this merely signifies the [[consciousness]] that my will is subordinate to
a [[law]], without the intervention of other influences on my sense. the
immediate determination of the will by the [[law]], and the
consciousness of this, is called [[respect]], so that this is regarded
as an effect of the [[law]] on the [[subject]], and not as the cause of it.
respect is properly the conception of a worth which thwarts my
self-love. accordingly it is something which is considered neither
as an object of inclination nor of [[fear]], although it has something
analogous to both. the object of [[respect]] is the [[law]] only, and that the
law which we impose on ourselves and yet recognise as necessary in
itself. as a [[law]], we are subjected too it without consulting
self-love; as imposed by us on ourselves, it is a result of our
will. in the former aspect it has an analogy to [[fear]], in the latter to
inclination. [[respect]] for a [[person]] is properly only [[respect]] for the law
(of honesty, etc.) of which he gives us an [[example]]. since we also look
on the improvement of our [[talents]] as a [[duty]], we consider that we see
in a [[person]] of [[talents]], as it were, the [[example]] of a [[law]] (viz., to
become like him in this by exercise), and this constitutes our
respect. all so-called [[moral]] interest consists simply in [[respect]] for
the [[law]].



but what sort of [[law]] can that be, the conception of which must
determine the will, even without paying any regard to the effect
expected from it, in order that this will may be called good
absolutely and without qualification? as i have deprived the will of
every impulse which could arise to it from [[obedience]] to any [[law]], there
remains nothing but the universal conformity of its actions to law
in general, which alone is to serve the will as a [[principle]], i.e., i
am never to act otherwise than so that i could also will that my maxim
should become a universal [[law]]. here, now, it is the simple
conformity to [[law]] in general, without assuming any particular law
applicable to [[certain]] actions, that serves the will as its principle
and must so serve it, if [[duty]] is not to be a [[vain]] delusion and a
chimerical notion. the [[common]] [[reason]] of [[men]] in its practical
judgements perfectly coincides with this and always has in view the
principle here suggested. let the [[question]] be, for [[example]]: may i when
in distress make a promise with the intention not to keep it? i
readily distinguish here between the two significations which the
question may have: whether it is prudent, or whether it is [[right]], to
make a false promise? the former may undoubtedly often be the case. i see
clearly indeed that it is not enough to extricate myself from a
present difficulty by means of this subterfuge, but it must be well
considered whether there may not hereafter spring from this [[lie]] much
greater inconvenience than that from which i now [[free]] myself, and
as, with all my supposed cunning, the consequences cannot be so easily
foreseen but that credit once lost may be much more injurious to me
than any mischief which i seek to avoid at [[present]], it should be
considered whether it would not be more prudent to act herein
according to a universal [[maxim]] and to make it a habit to promise
nothing except with the intention of keeping it. but it is soon
clear to me that such a [[maxim]] will still only be based on the fear
of consequences. now it is a wholly different thing to be truthful
from [[duty]] and to be so from apprehension of injurious consequences. in
the first case, the very notion of the action already implies a law
for me; in the second case, i must first look about elsewhere to see
what results may be combined with it which would affect myself. for to
deviate from the [[principle]] of [[duty]] is beyond all [[doubt]] wicked; but
to be unfaithful to my [[maxim]] of prudence may often be very
advantageous to me, although to abide by it is certainly safer. the
shortest way, however, and an unerring one, to discover the answer
to this [[question]] whether a lying promise is consistent with [[duty]], is
to ask myself, "should i be content that my [[maxim]] (to extricate myself
from difficulty by a false promise) should hold [[good]] as a universal
law, for myself as well as for others?" and should i be able to say
to myself, "every one may make a deceitful promise when he finds
himself in a difficulty from which he cannot otherwise extricate
himself?" then i presently become aware that while i can will the [[lie]],
i can by no means will that lying should be a universal [[law]]. for
with such a [[law]] there would be no promises at all, since it would be
in [[vain]] to allege my intention in regard to my future actions to those
who would not [[believe]] this allegation, or if they over hastily did
so would [[pay]] me back in my own coin. hence my [[maxim]], as soon as it
should be made a universal [[law]], would necessarily [[destroy]] itself.

i do not, therefore, need any far-reaching penetration to discern
what i have to do in order that my will may be morally [[good]].
inexperienced in the course of the [[world]], incapable of being
prepared for all its contingencies, i only ask myself: canst thou also
will that thy [[maxim]] should be a universal [[law]]? if not, then it must be
rejected, and that not because of a disadvantage accruing from it to
myself or even to others, but because it cannot enter as a principle
into a possible universal legislation, and [[reason]] extorts from me
immediate [[respect]] for such legislation. i do not indeed as yet discern
on what this [[respect]] is based (this the philosopher may inquire),
but at least i [[understand]] this, that it is an estimation of the
worth which far outweighs all worth of what is recommended by
inclination, and that the necessity of acting from pure [[respect]] for
the practical [[law]] is what constitutes [[duty]], to which every other
motive must give place, because it is the condition of a will being
good in itself, and the worth of such a will is above everything.

thus, then, without quitting the [[moral]] [[knowledge]] of [[common]] human
reason, we have arrived at its [[principle]]. and although, no [[doubt]],
common [[men]] do not conceive it in such an abstract and universal
form, yet they always have it really before their [[eyes]] and use it as
the standard of their decision. here it would be easy to show how,
with this compass in hand, [[men]] are well able to distinguish, in
every case that occurs, what is [[good]], what [[bad]], conformably to [[duty]] or
inconsistent with it, if, without in the least teaching them
anything new, we only, like [[socrates]], direct their attention to the
principle they themselves employ; and that, therefore, we do not
need [[science]] and [[philosophy]] to [[know]] what we should do to be honest and
good, yea, even [[wise]] and [[virtuous]]. indeed we might well have
conjectured beforehand that the [[knowledge]] of what every [[man]] is bound
to do, and therefore also to [[know]], would be within the reach of
every [[man]], even the commonest. here we cannot forbear admiration
when we see how [[great]] an advantage the practical judgement has over
the theoretical in the [[common]] understanding of [[men]]. in the latter,
if [[common]] [[reason]] ventures to depart from the laws [[law]] of [[experience]] and
from the perceptions of the senses, it falls into mere
inconceivabilities and self-contradictions, at least into a [[chaos]] of
uncertainty, obscurity, and instability. but in the practical sphere
it is just when the [[common]] understanding excludes all sensible springs
from practical laws [[law]] that its [[power]] of judgement begins to show
itself to advantage. it then becomes even subtle, whether it be that
it chicanes with its own [[conscience]] or with other claims respecting
what is to be called [[right]], or whether it desires [[desire]] for its own
instruction to determine honestly the worth of actions; and, in the
latter case, it may even have as [[good]] a [[hope]] of hitting the mark as
any philosopher whatever can promise himself. nay, it is almost more
sure of doing so, because the philosopher cannot have any other
principle, while he may easily perplex his judgement by a multitude of
considerations [[foreign]] to the matter, and so turn aside from the right
way. would it not therefore be wiser in [[moral]] concerns to acquiesce in
the judgement of [[common]] [[reason]], or at most only to call in
philosophy for the [[purpose]] of rendering the [[system]] of morals [[moral]] more
complete and intelligible, and its rules [[rule]] more convenient for use
(especially for disputation), but not so as to draw off the common
understanding from its [[happy]] simplicity, or to bring it by means of
philosophy into a new path of inquiry and instruction?

innocence is indeed a glorious thing; only, on the other hand, it is
very [[sad]] that it cannot well maintain itself and is easily seduced. on
this account even wisdom- which otherwise consists more in conduct
than in knowledge- yet has need of [[science]], not in order to learn from
it, but to secure for its precepts admission and permanence. against
all the commands of [[duty]] which [[reason]] represents to [[man]] as so
deserving of [[respect]], he feels [[feel]] in himself a powerful counterpoise in
his wants and inclinations, the entire satisfaction of which he sums
up under the name of [[happiness]]. now [[reason]] issues its commands
unyieldingly, without promising anything to the inclinations, and,
as it were, with disregard and contempt for these claims, which are so
impetuous, and at the same [[time]] so plausible, and which will not allow
themselves to be suppressed by any command. hence there arises a
natural dialectic, i.e., a disposition, to argue against these
strict laws [[law]] of [[duty]] and to [[question]] their validity, or at least
their purity and strictness; and, if possible, to make them more
accordant with our wishes [[wish]] and inclinations, that is to say, to corrupt
them at their very source, and entirely to [[destroy]] their worth- a
thing which even [[common]] practical [[reason]] cannot ultimately call [[good]].

thus is the [[common]] [[reason]] of [[man]] compelled to go out of its
sphere, and to take a step into the field of a practical [[philosophy]],
not to satisfy any speculative want (which never occurs to it as
long as it is content to be mere sound reason), but even on
practical grounds, in order to attain in it information and clear
instruction respecting the source of its [[principle]], and the correct
determination of it in opposition to the maxims [[maxim]] which are based on
wants and inclinations, so that it may escape from the perplexity of
opposite claims and not run the risk of losing all [[genuine]] moral
principles through the equivocation into which it easily falls.
thus, when practical [[reason]] cultivates itself, there insensibly arises
in it a dialetic which forces [[force]] it to seek aid in [[philosophy]], just as
happens to it in its theoretic use; and in this case, therefore, as
well as in the other, it will find rest nowhere but in a thorough
critical examination of our [[reason]].

                   second section



       transition from popular [[moral]] philosophy

            to the metaphysic of morals



if we have hitherto drawn our notion of [[duty]] from the [[common]] use
of our practical [[reason]], it is by no means to be inferred that we have
treated it as an empirical notion. on the contrary, if we attend to
the [[experience]] of men's conduct, we meet frequent and, as we ourselves
allow, just complaints that one cannot find a [[single]] [[certain]] example
of the disposition to act from pure [[duty]]. although many things are
done in conformity with what [[duty]] prescribes, it is nevertheless
always doubtful whether they are done strictly from [[duty]], so as to
have a [[moral]] worth. hence there have at all times [[time]] been philosophers
who have altogether denied that this disposition actually exists at
all in [[human]] actions, and have ascribed everything to a more or less
refined self-love. not that they have on that account questioned the
soundness of the conception of morality; on the contrary, they spoke
with sincere regret of the frailty and [[corruption]] of [[human]] [[nature]],
which, though [[noble]] enough to take its [[rule]] an [[idea]] so worthy of
respect, is yet [[weak]] to [[follow]] it and employs [[reason]] which ought to
give it the [[law]] only for the [[purpose]] of providing for the interest
of the inclinations, whether singly or at the [[best]] in the greatest
possible harmony with one another.

in [[fact]], it is absolutely impossible to make out by experience
with complete certainty a [[single]] case in which the [[maxim]] of an action,
however [[right]] in itself, rested simply on [[moral]] grounds and on the
conception of [[duty]]. sometimes it happens that with the sharpest
self-examination we can find nothing beside the [[moral]] [[principle]] of
duty which could have been powerful enough to move us to this or
that action and to so [[great]] a [[sacrifice]]; yet we cannot from this infer
with certainty that it was not really some secret impulse of
self-love, under the false appearance of [[duty]], that was the actual
determining cause of the will. we like them to flatter ourselves by
falsely taking credit for a more [[noble]] motive; whereas in [[fact]] we
can never, even by the strictest examination, get completely behind
the secret springs of action; since, when the [[question]] is of moral
worth, it is not with the actions which we see that we are
concerned, but with those inward principles [[principle]] of them which we do not
see.

moreover, we cannot [[better]] serve the wishes [[wish]] of those who ridicule
all morality as a mere chimera of [[human]] [[imagination]] over stepping
itself from vanity, than by conceding to them that notions of duty
must be drawn only from [[experience]] (as from indolence, [[people]] are
ready to [[think]] is also the case with all other notions); for or is
to prepare for them a [[certain]] triumph. i am willing to admit out of
love of [[humanity]] that even most of our actions are [[correct]], but if
we look closer at them we everywhere come upon the dear [[self]] which
is always prominent, and it is this they have in view and not the
strict command of [[duty]] which would often require self-denial.
without being an [[enemy]] of [[virtue]], a cool observer, one that does not
mistake the [[wish]] for [[good]], however lively, for its reality, may
sometimes [[doubt]] whether true [[virtue]] is actually found anywhere in
the [[world]], and this especially as years increase and the judgement
is partly made wiser by [[experience]] and partly, also, more acute in
observation. this being so, nothing can secure us from falling away
altogether from our ideas [[idea]] of [[duty]], or maintain in the [[soul]] a
well-grounded [[respect]] for its [[law]], but the clear conviction that
although there should never have been actions which really sprang from
such pure sources, yet whether this or that takes place is not at
all the [[question]]; but that [[reason]] of itself, independent on all
experience, ordains what ought to take place, that accordingly actions
of which perhaps the [[world]] has hitherto never given an [[example]], the
feasibility even of which might be very much doubted by one who founds
everything on [[experience]], are nevertheless inflexibly commanded by
reason; that, e.g., even though there might never yet have been a
sincere friend, yet not a whit the less is pure sincerity in
friendship required of every [[man]], because, prior to all [[experience]],
this [[duty]] is involved as [[duty]] in the [[idea]] of a [[reason]] determining
the will by a priori principles [[principle]].

when we add further that, unless we deny that the notion of morality
has any [[truth]] or reference to any possible object, we must admit
that its [[law]] must be valid, not merely for [[men]] but for all rational
creatures generally, not merely under [[certain]] contingent conditions or
with exceptions but with absolute necessity, then it is clear that
no [[experience]] could enable us to infer even the possibility of such
apodeictic laws [[law]]. for with what [[right]] could we bring into unbounded
respect as a universal precept for every [[rational]] [[nature]] that which
perhaps holds only under the contingent conditions of [[humanity]]? or how
could laws [[law]] of the determination of our will be regarded as laws [[law]] of the
determination of the will of [[rational]] beings generally, and for us
only as such, if they were merely empirical and did not take their
origin wholly a priori from pure but practical [[reason]]?

nor could anything be more fatal to morality than that we should
wish to derive it from examples [[example]]. for every [[example]] of it that is set
before me must be first itself tested by principles [[principle]] of morality,
whether it is worthy to serve as an original [[example]], i.e., as a
pattern; but by no means can it authoritatively furnish the conception
of morality. even the holy one of the gospels must first be compared
with our ideal of [[moral]] [[perfection]] before we can recognise him as
such; and so he says of himself, "why call ye me (whom you see)
good; none is [[good]] (the model of good) but [[god]] only (whom ye do not
see)?" but whence have we the conception of [[god]] as the supreme [[good]]?
simply from the [[idea]] of [[moral]] [[perfection]], which [[reason]] frames a priori
and connects inseparably with the notion of a [[free]] will. imitation
finds no place at all in morality, and examples [[example]] serve only for
encouragement, i.e., they put beyond [[doubt]] the feasibility of what the
law commands, they make visible that which the practical rule
expresses more generally, but they can never authorize us to set aside
the true original which lies [[lie]] in [[reason]] and to guide ourselves by
examples.

if then there is no [[genuine]] supreme [[principle]] of morality but what
must rest simply on pure [[reason]], independent of all [[experience]], i
think it is not necessary even to put the [[question]] whether it is
good to exhibit these concepts in their generality (in abstracto) as
they are established a priori along with the principles [[principle]] belonging to
them, if our [[knowledge]] is to be distinguished from the vulgar and to
be called philosophical.

in our times [[time]] indeed this might perhaps be necessary; for if we
collected votes whether pure [[rational]] [[knowledge]] separated from
everything empirical, that is to say, metaphysic of morals [[moral]], or whether
popular practical [[philosophy]] is to be preferred, it is easy to guess
which side would preponderate.

this descending to popular notions is certainly very commendable, if
the ascent to the principles [[principle]] of pure [[reason]] has first taken place
and been satisfactorily accomplished. this implies that we first found
ethics on metaphysics, and then, when it is firmly established,
procure a hearing for it by giving it a popular [[character]]. but it is
quite absurd to try to be popular in the first inquiry, on which the
soundness of the principles [[principle]] depends. it is not only that this
proceeding can never lay claim to the very rare [[merit]] of a true
philosophical popularity, since there is no art [[arts]] in being
intelligible if one renounces all thoroughness of insight; but also it
produces a disgusting medley of compiled observations and
half-reasoned principles [[principle]]. shallow pates enjoy this because it can be
used for every-day chat, but the sagacious find in it only
confusion, and being unsatisfied and unable to [[help]] themselves, they
turn away their [[eyes]], while [[philosophers]], who see quite well through
this delusion, are little listened to when they call [[men]] off for a
time from this pretended popularity, in order that they might be
rightfully popular after they have attained a definite insight.

we need only look at the attempts of moralists in that favourite
fashion, and we shall find at one [[time]] the special [[constitution]] of
human [[nature]] (including, however, the [[idea]] of a [[rational]] nature
generally), at one [[time]] [[perfection]], at another [[happiness]], here moral
sense, there [[fear]] of [[god]]. a little of this, and a little of that, in
marvellous mixture, without its occurring to them to ask whether the
principles of morality are to be sought in the [[knowledge]] of human
nature at all (which we can have only from experience); or, if this is
not so, if these principles [[principle]] are to be found altogether a priori,
free from everything empirical, in pure [[rational]] concepts only and
nowhere else, not even in the smallest [[degree]]; then rather to adopt
the method of making this a separate inquiry, as pure practical
philosophy, or (if one may use a name so decried) as metaphysic of
morals, * to bring it by itself to completeness, and to require the
public, which wishes [[wish]] for popular treatment, to await the issue of this
undertaking.



* just as pure mathematics are distinguished from applied, pure
logic from applied, so if we choose we may also distinguish pure
philosophy of morals [[moral]] (metaphysic) from applied (viz., applied to human
nature). by this designation we are also at once reminded that moral
principles are not based on properties [[property]] of [[human]] [[nature]], but must
subsist a priori of themselves, while from such principles [[principle]] practical
rules must be capable of being deduced for every [[rational]] [[nature]],
and accordingly for that of [[man]].



such a metaphysic of morals [[moral]], completely isolated, not mixed with any
anthropology, theology, physics, or hyperphysics, and still less
with occult qualities (which we might call hypophysical), is not
only an indispensable substratum of all sound theoretical [[knowledge]] of
duties, but is at the same [[time]] a desideratum of the highest
importance to the actual fulfilment of their precepts. for the pure
conception of [[duty]], unmixed with any [[foreign]] addition of empirical
attractions, and, in a word, the conception of the [[moral]] [[law]],
exercises on the [[human]] [[heart]], by way of [[reason]] alone (which first
becomes aware with this that it can of itself be practical), an
influence so much more powerful than all other springs * which may be
derived from the field of [[experience]], that, in the [[consciousness]] of
its worth, it despises the latter, and can by degrees [[degree]] become their
master; whereas a mixed ethics, compounded partly of motives drawn
from feelings and inclinations, and partly also of conceptions of
reason, must make the [[mind]] waver between motives which cannot be
brought under any [[principle]], which lead to [[good]] only by mere
accident and very often also to [[evil]].



* i have a letter from the late excellent sulzer, in which he asks
me what can be the [[reason]] that [[moral]] instruction, although containing
much that is convincing for the [[reason]], yet accomplishes so little? my
answer was postponed in order that i might make it complete. but it is
simply this: that the teachers themselves have not got their own
notions clear, and when they endeavour to make up for this by raking
up motives of [[moral]] goodness from every quarter, trying to make
their physic [[right]] [[strong]], they spoil it. for the commonest
understanding shows that if we imagine, on the one hand, an act of
honesty done with steadfast [[mind]], apart from every view to advantage
of any [[kind]] in this [[world]] or another, and even under the greatest
temptations of necessity or allurement, and, on the other hand, a
similar act which was affected, in however low a [[degree]], by a
foreign motive, the former leaves far behind and eclipses the
second; it elevates the [[soul]] and inspires the [[wish]] to be able to act
in like manner oneself. even moderately [[young]] [[children]] [[feel]] this
impression, ana one should never represent duties [[duty]] to them in any other
light.



from what has been said, it is clear that all [[moral]] conceptions have
their seat and origin completely a priori in the [[reason]], and that,
moreover, in the commonest [[reason]] just as truly as in that which is in
the highest [[degree]] speculative; that they cannot be obtained by
abstraction from any empirical, and therefore merely contingent,
knowledge; that it is just this purity of their origin that makes them
worthy to serve as our supreme practical [[principle]], and that just in
proportion as we add anything empirical, we detract from their genuine
influence and from the absolute value of actions; that it is not
only of the [[greatest]] necessity, in a purely speculative point of view,
but is also of the [[greatest]] practical importance, to derive these
notions and laws [[law]] from pure [[reason]], to [[present]] them pure and unmixed,
and even to determine the compass of this practical or pure rational
knowledge, i.e., to determine the whole faculty of pure practical
reason; and, in doing so, we must not make its principles [[principle]] dependent on
the particular [[nature]] of [[human]] [[reason]], though in speculative
philosophy this may be permitted, or may even at times [[time]] be necessary;
but since [[moral]] laws [[law]] ought to hold [[good]] for every [[rational]] creature,
we must derive them from the general concept of a [[rational]] being. in
this way, although for its application to [[man]] morality has need of
anthropology, yet, in the first instance, we must treat it
independently as pure [[philosophy]], i.e., as metaphysic, complete in
itself (a thing which in such distinct branches of [[science]] is easily
done); knowing well that unless we are in possession of this, it would
not only be [[vain]] to determine the [[moral]] element of [[duty]] in right
actions for purposes [[purpose]] of speculative criticism, but it would be
impossible to base morals [[moral]] on their [[genuine]] principles [[principle]], even for common
practical purposes [[purpose]], especially of [[moral]] instruction, so as to
produce pure [[moral]] dispositions, and to engraft them on men's minds [[mind]] to
the promotion of the [[greatest]] possible [[good]] in the [[world]].

but in order that in this study we may not merely advance by the
natural steps from the [[common]] [[moral]] judgement (in this case very
worthy of respect) to the philosophical, as has been already done, but
also from a popular [[philosophy]], which goes no further than it can
reach by groping with the [[help]] of examples [[example]], to metaphysic (which
does allow itself to be checked by anything empirical and, as it
must measure the whole extent of this [[kind]] of [[rational]] [[knowledge]], goes
as far as ideal conceptions, where even examples [[example]] fail us), we must
follow and clearly describe the practical faculty of [[reason]], from
the general rules [[rule]] of its determination to the point where the notion
of [[duty]] springs from it.

everything in [[nature]] works [[work]] according to laws [[law]]. [[rational]] beings
alone have the faculty of acting according to the conception of
laws, that is according to principles [[principle]], i.e., have a will. since the
deduction of actions from principles [[principle]] requires [[reason]], the will is
nothing but practical [[reason]]. if [[reason]] infallibly determines the
will, then the actions of such a being which are recognised as
objectively necessary are subjectively necessary also, i.e., the
will is a faculty to choose that only which [[reason]] independent of
inclination recognises as practically necessary, i.e., as [[good]]. but if
reason of itself does not sufficiently determine the will, if the
latter is [[subject]] also to subjective conditions (particular
impulses) which do not always coincide with the objective
conditions; in a word, if the will does not in itself completely
accord with [[reason]] (which is actually the case with men), then the
actions which objectively are recognised as necessary are subjectively
contingent, and the determination of such a will according to
objective laws [[law]] is obligation, that is to say, the relation of the
objective laws [[law]] to a will that is not thoroughly [[good]] is conceived as
the determination of the will of a [[rational]] being by principles [[principle]] of
reason, but which the will from its [[nature]] does not of necessity
follow.

the conception of an objective [[principle]], in so far as it is
obligatory for a will, is called a command (of reason), and the
formula of the command is called an imperative.

all imperatives are expressed by the word ought [or shall], and
thereby indicate the relation of an objective [[law]] of [[reason]] to a will,
which from its subjective [[constitution]] is not necessarily determined
by it (an obligation). they say that something would be [[good]] to do
or to forbear, but they say it to a will which does not always do a
thing because it is conceived to be [[good]] to do it. that is practically
good, however, which determines the will by means of the conceptions
of [[reason]], and consequently not from subjective causes, but
objectively, that is on principles [[principle]] which are valid for every
rational being as such. it is distinguished from the pleasant, as that
which influences the will only by means of sensation from merely
subjective causes, valid only for the sense of this or that one, and
not as a [[principle]] of [[reason]], which holds for every one. *



* the dependence of the desires [[desire]] on sensations is called
inclination, and this accordingly always indicates a want. the
dependence of a contingently determinable will on principles [[principle]] of reason
is called an interest. this therefore, is found only in the case of
a dependent will which does not always of itself conform to [[reason]]; in
the [[divine]] will we cannot conceive any interest. but the [[human]] will
can also take an interest in a thing without therefore acting from
interest. the former signifies the practical interest in the action,
the latter the pathological in the object of the action. the former
indicates only dependence of the will on principles [[principle]] of [[reason]] in
themselves; the second, dependence on principles [[principle]] of [[reason]] for the
sake of inclination, [[reason]] supplying only the practical rules [[rule]] how the
requirement of the inclination may be satisfied. in the first case the
action interests me; in the second the object of the action (because
it is pleasant to me). we have seen in the first section that in an
action done from [[duty]] we must look not to the interest in the
object, but only to that in the action itself, and in its rational
principle (viz., the law).



a perfectly [[good]] will would therefore be equally [[subject]] to
objective laws [[law]] (viz., laws [[law]] of good), but could not be conceived as
obliged thereby to act lawfully, because of itself from its subjective
constitution it can only be determined by the conception of [[good]].
therefore no imperatives hold for the [[divine]] will, or in general for a
holy will; ought is here out of place, because the volition is already
of itself necessarily in unison with the [[law]]. therefore imperatives
are only formulae to express the relation of objective laws [[law]] of all
volition to the subjective imperfection of the will of this or that
rational being, e.g., the [[human]] will.

now all imperatives command either hypothetically or
categorically. the former represent the practical necessity of a
possible action as means to something else that is willed (or at least
which one might possibly will). the categorical imperative would be
that which represented an action as necessary of itself without
reference to another end, i.e., as objectively necessary.

since every practical [[law]] represents a possible action as good
and, on this account, for a [[subject]] who is practically determinable by
reason, necessary, all imperatives are formulae determining an
action which is necessary according to the [[principle]] of a will [[good]] in
some respects [[respect]]. if now the action is [[good]] only as a means to
something else, then the imperative is hypothetical; if it is
conceived as [[good]] in itself and consequently as being necessarily
the [[principle]] of a will which of itself conforms to [[reason]], then it is
categorical.

thus the imperative declares what action possible by me would be
good and presents [[present]] the practical [[rule]] in relation to a will which
does not forthwith perform an action simply because it is [[good]],
whether because the [[subject]] does not always [[know]] that it is [[good]], or
because, even if it [[know]] this, yet its maxims [[maxim]] might be opposed to
the objective principles [[principle]] of practical [[reason]].

accordingly the hypothetical imperative only says that the action is
good for some [[purpose]], possible or actual. in the first case it is a
problematical, in the second an assertorial practical [[principle]]. the
categorical imperative which declares an action to be objectively
necessary in itself without reference to any [[purpose]], i.e., without
any other end, is valid as an apodeictic (practical) [[principle]].

whatever is possible only by the [[power]] of some [[rational]] being may
also be conceived as a possible [[purpose]] of some will; and therefore
the principles [[principle]] of action as regards the means necessary to attain some
possible [[purpose]] are in [[fact]] infinitely numerous. all sciences [[science]] have
a practical part, consisting of problems expressing that some end is
possible for us and of imperatives directing how it may be attained.
these may, therefore, be called in general imperatives of [[skill]].
here there is no [[question]] whether the end is [[rational]] and [[good]], but
only what one must do in order to attain it. the precepts for the
physician to make his patient thoroughly healthy, and for a poisoner
to ensure [[certain]] [[death]], are of [[equal]] value in this [[respect]], that each
serves to effect its [[purpose]] perfectly. since in early [[youth]] it cannot
be known what ends are likely to occur to us in the course of [[life]],
parents seek to have their [[children]] taught a [[great]] many things, and
provide for their [[skill]] in the use of means for all sorts of arbitrary
ends, of none of which can they determine whether it may not perhaps
hereafter be an object to their pupil, but which it is at all events
possible that he might aim at; and this [[anxiety]] is so [[great]] that
they commonly neglect to form and [[correct]] their judgement on the value
of the things which may be chosen as ends.

there is one end, however, which may be assumed to be actually
such to all [[rational]] beings (so far as imperatives apply to them,
viz., as dependent beings), and, therefore, one [[purpose]] which they not
merely may have, but which we may with certainty assume that they
all actually have by a [[natural]] necessity, and this is [[happiness]]. the
hypothetical imperative which expresses the practical necessity of
an action as means to the advancement of [[happiness]] is assertorial.
we are not to [[present]] it as necessary for an uncertain and merely
possible [[purpose]], but for a [[purpose]] which we may presuppose with
certainty and a priori in every [[man]], because it belongs to his
being. now [[skill]] in the [[choice]] of means to his own [[greatest]] well-being
may be called prudence, * in the narrowest sense. and thus the
imperative which refers to the [[choice]] of means to one's own [[happiness]],
i.e., the precept of prudence, is still always hypothetical; the
action is not commanded absolutely, but only as means to another
purpose.



* the word prudence is taken in two senses: in the one it may bear
the name of [[knowledge]] of the [[world]], in the other that of private
prudence. the former is a man's [[man]] ability to influence others so as to
use them for his own purposes [[purpose]]. the latter is the sagacity to combine
all these purposes [[purpose]] for his own lasting benefit. this latter is
properly that to which the value even of the former is reduced, and
when a [[man]] is prudent in the former sense, but not in the latter, we
might [[better]] say of him that he is clever and cunning, but, on the
whole, imprudent.



finally, there is an imperative which commands a [[certain]] conduct
immediately, without having as its condition any other [[purpose]] to be
attained by it. this imperative is categorical. it concerns not the
matter of the action, or its intended result, but its form and the
principle of which it is itself a result; and what is essentially good
in it consists in the mental disposition, let the consequence be
what it may. this imperative may be called that of morality.

there is a marked distinction also between the volitions on these
three sorts of principles [[principle]] in the dissimilarity of the obligation of
the will. in order to mark this difference more clearly, i think
they would be most suitably named in their order if we said they are
either rules [[rule]] of [[skill]], or counsels of prudence, or commands (laws)
of morality. for it is [[law]] only that involves the conception of an
unconditional and objective necessity, which is consequently
universally valid; and commands are laws [[law]] which must be obeyed, that
is, must be followed, even in opposition to inclination. counsels,
indeed, involve necessity, but one which can only hold under a
contingent subjective condition, viz., they depend on whether this
or that [[man]] reckons this or that as part of his [[happiness]]; the
categorical imperative, on the contrary, is not limited by any
condition, and as being absolutely, although practically, necessary,
may be quite properly called a command. we might also call the first
kind of imperatives technical (belonging to art), the second
pragmatic * (to welfare), the third [[moral]] (belonging to [[free]] conduct
generally, that is, to morals).



* it seems to me that the proper signification of the word
pragmatic may be most accurately defined in this way. for sanctions
are called pragmatic which flow properly not from the [[law]] of the
states as necessary enactments, but from precaution for the general
welfare. a [[history]] is composed pragmatically when it teaches [[teach]] prudence,
i.e., instructs the [[world]] how it can provide for its interests [[better]],
or at least as well as, the [[men]] of former [[time]].



now arises the [[question]], how are all these imperatives possible?
this [[question]] does not seek to [[know]] how we can conceive the
accomplishment of the action which the imperative ordains, but
merely how we can conceive the obligation of the will which the
imperative expresses. no special explanation is needed to show how
an imperative of [[skill]] is possible. whoever wills the end, wills
also (so far as [[reason]] decides his conduct) the means in his power
which are indispensably necessary thereto. this proposition is, as
regards the volition, analytical; for, in willing an object as my
effect, there is already [[thought]] the causality of myself as an
acting cause, that is to say, the use of the means; and the imperative
educes from the conception of volition of an end the conception of
actions necessary to this end. synthetical propositions must no
doubt be employed in defining the means to a proposed end; but they do
not concern the [[principle]], the act of the will, but the object and its
realization. e.g., that in order to bisect a line on an unerring
principle i must draw from its extremities two intersecting arcs; this
no [[doubt]] is taught by mathematics only in synthetical propositions;
but if i [[know]] that it is only by this process that the intended
operation can be performed, then to say that, if i fully will the
operation, i also will the action required for it, is an analytical
proposition; for it is one and the same thing to conceive something as
an effect which i can [[produce]] in a [[certain]] way, and to conceive myself
as acting in this way.

if it were only equally easy to give a definite conception of
happiness, the imperatives of prudence would correspond exactly with
those of [[skill]], and would likewise be analytical. for in this case
as in that, it could be said: "whoever wills the end, wills also
(according to the dictate of [[reason]] necessarily) the indispensable
means thereto which are in his [[power]]." but, unfortunately, the
notion of [[happiness]] is so indefinite that although every [[man]] wishes [[wish]] to
attain it, yet he never can say definitely and consistently what it is
that he really wishes [[wish]] and wills. the [[reason]] of this is that all the
elements which belong to the notion of [[happiness]] are altogether
empirical, i.e., they must be borrowed from [[experience]], and
nevertheless the [[idea]] of [[happiness]] requires an absolute whole, a
maximum of welfare in my [[present]] and all future circumstances. now
it is impossible that the most clear-sighted and at the same [[time]] most
powerful being (supposed finite) should frame to himself a definite
conception of what he really wills in this. does he will riches [[rich]], how
much [[anxiety]], envy, and snares might he not thereby draw upon his
shoulders? does he will [[knowledge]] and discernment, perhaps it might
prove to be only an eye so much the sharper to show him so much the
more fearfully the evils [[evil]] that are now concealed from him, and that
cannot be avoided, or to impose more wants on his desires [[desire]], which
already give him concern enough. would he have long [[life]]? who
guarantees to him that it would not be a long misery? would he at
least have health? how often has uneasiness of the [[body]] restrained
from excesses into which [[perfect]] health would have allowed one to
fall? and so on. in short, he is unable, on any [[principle]], to
determine with certainty what would make him truly [[happy]]; because to
do so he would need to be omniscient. we cannot therefore act on any
definite principles [[principle]] to secure [[happiness]], but only on empirical
counsels, e.g. of regimen, frugality, courtesy, reserve, etc., which
experience teaches [[teach]] do, on the average, most promote well-being.
hence it follows that the imperatives of prudence do not, strictly
speaking, command at all, that is, they cannot [[present]] actions
objectively as practically necessary; that they are rather to be
regarded as counsels (consilia) than precepts precepts of [[reason]], that
the problem to determine certainly and universally what action would
promote the [[happiness]] of a [[rational]] being is completely insoluble, and
consequently no imperative respecting it is possible which should,
in the strict sense, command to do what makes [[happy]]; because happiness
is not an ideal of [[reason]] but of [[imagination]], resting solely on
empirical grounds, and it is [[vain]] to expect that these should define
an action by which one could attain the totality of a series of
consequences which is really endless. this imperative of prudence
would however be an analytical proposition if we assume that the means
to [[happiness]] could be certainly assigned; for it is distinguished from
the imperative of [[skill]] only by this, that in the latter the end is
merely possible, in the former it is given; as however both only
ordain the means to that which we suppose to be willed as an end, it
follows that the imperative which ordains the willing of the means
to him who wills the end is in both cases analytical. thus there is no
difficulty in regard to the possibility of an imperative of this
kind either.

on the other hand, the [[question]] how the imperative of morality is
possible, is undoubtedly one, the only one, demanding a solution, as
this is not at all hypothetical, and the objective necessity which
it presents [[present]] cannot rest on any hypothesis, as is the case with the
hypothetical imperatives. only here we must never leave out of
consideration that we cannot make out by any [[example]], in other words
empirically, whether there is such an imperative at all, but it is
rather to be feared that all those which seem to be categorical may
yet be at bottom hypothetical. for instance, when the precept is:
"thou shalt not promise deceitfully"; and it is assumed that the
necessity of this is not a mere counsel to avoid some other [[evil]], so
that it should mean: "thou shalt not make a lying promise, lest if
it become known thou shouldst [[destroy]] thy credit," but that an
action of this [[kind]] must be regarded as [[evil]] in itself, so that the
imperative of the prohibition is categorical; then we cannot show with
certainty in any [[example]] that the will was determined merely by the
law, without any other spring of action, although it may appear to
be so. for it is always possible that [[fear]] of disgrace, perhaps also
obscure dread of other dangers, may have a secret influence on the
will. who can prove by [[experience]] the non-existence of a cause when
all that [[experience]] tells us is that we do not perceive it? but in
such a case the so-called [[moral]] imperative, which as such appears to
be categorical and unconditional, would in reality be only a pragmatic
precept, drawing our attention to our own interests and merely
teaching us to take these into consideration.

we shall therefore have to investigate a priori the possibility of a
categorical imperative, as we have not in this case the advantage of
its reality being given in [[experience]], so that [the elucidation of]
its possibility should be requisite only for its explanation, not
for its establishment. in the meantime it may be discerned
beforehand that the categorical imperative alone has the purport of
a practical [[law]]; all the rest may indeed be called principles [[principle]] of the
will but not laws [[law]], since whatever is only necessary for the attainment
of some arbitrary [[purpose]] may be considered as in itself contingent,
and we can at any [[time]] be [[free]] from the precept if we give up the
purpose; on the contrary, the unconditional command leaves the will no
liberty to choose the opposite; consequently it alone carries with
it that necessity which we require in a [[law]].

secondly, in the case of this categorical imperative or [[law]] of
morality, the difficulty (of discerning its possibility) is a very
profound one. it is an a priori synthetical practical proposition; *
and as there is so much difficulty in discerning the possibility of
speculative propositions of this [[kind]], it may readily be supposed that
the difficulty will be no less with the practical.



* i connect the act with the will without presupposing any
condition resulting from any inclination, but a priori, and
therefore necessarily (though only objectively, i.e., assuming the
idea of a [[reason]] possessing full [[power]] over all subjective motives).
this is accordingly a practical proposition which does not deduce
the willing of an action by mere analysis from another already
presupposed (for we have not such a [[perfect]] will), but connects it
immediately with the conception of the will of a [[rational]] being, as
something not contained in it.



in this problem we will first inquire whether the mere conception of
a categorical imperative may not perhaps supply us also with the
formula of it, containing the proposition which alone can be a
categorical imperative; for even if we [[know]] the tenor of such an
absolute command, yet how it is possible will require further
special and laborious study, which we postpone to the [[last]] section.

when i conceive a hypothetical imperative, in general i do not
know beforehand what it will contain until i am given the condition.
but when i conceive a categorical imperative, i [[know]] at once what it
contains. for as the imperative contains besides the [[law]] only the
necessity that the maxims [[maxim]] * shall conform to this [[law]], while the law
contains no conditions restricting it, there remains nothing but the
general statement that the [[maxim]] of the action should conform to a
universal [[law]], and it is this conformity alone that the imperative
properly represents as necessary.



* a [[maxim]] is a subjective [[principle]] of action, and must be
distinguished from the objective [[principle]], namely, practical [[law]]. the
former contains the practical [[rule]] set by [[reason]] according to the
conditions of the [[subject]] (often its ignorance or its inclinations),
so that it is the [[principle]] on which the [[subject]] acts; but the law
is the objective [[principle]] valid for every [[rational]] being, and is
the [[principle]] on which it ought to act that is an imperative.



there is therefore but one categorical imperative, namely, this: act
only on that [[maxim]] whereby thou canst at the same [[time]] will that it
should become a universal [[law]].

now if all imperatives of [[duty]] can be deduced from this one
imperative as from their [[principle]], then, although it should remain
undecided what is called [[duty]] is not merely a [[vain]] notion, yet at
least we shall be able to show what we [[understand]] by it and what
this notion means.

since the universality of the [[law]] according to which effects are
produced constitutes what is properly called [[nature]] in the most
general sense (as to form), that is the existence of things so far
as it is determined by general laws [[law]], the imperative of [[duty]] may be
expressed thus: act as if the [[maxim]] of thy action were to become by
thy will a universal [[law]] of [[nature]].

we will now enumerate a few duties [[duty]], adopting the usual division of
them into duties [[duty]] to ourselves and ourselves and to others, and into
perfect and imperfect duties [[duty]]. *



* it must be noted here that i reserve the division of duties [[duty]] for a
future metaphysic of morals [[moral]]; so that i give it here only as an
arbitrary one (in order to arrange my examples). for the rest, i
understand by a [[perfect]] [[duty]] one that admits no exception in favour of
inclination and then i have not merely external but also internal
perfect duties [[duty]]. this is contrary to the use of the word adopted in the
schools; but i do not intend to justify there, as it is all one for my
purpose whether it is admitted or not.



1. a [[man]] reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels [[feel]] wearied
of [[life]], but is still so far in possession of his [[reason]] that he can
ask himself whether it would not be contrary to his [[duty]] to himself to
take his own [[life]]. now he inquires whether the [[maxim]] of his action
could become a universal [[law]] of [[nature]]. his [[maxim]] is: "from
self-love i adopt it as a [[principle]] to shorten my [[life]] when its longer
duration is likely to bring more [[evil]] than satisfaction." it is
asked then simply whether this [[principle]] founded on self-love can
become a universal [[law]] of [[nature]]. now we see at once that a system
of [[nature]] of which it should be a [[law]] to [[destroy]] [[life]] by means of
the very feeling whose special [[nature]] it is to impel to the
improvement of [[life]] would contradict itself and, therefore, could
not [[exist]] as a [[system]] of [[nature]]; hence that [[maxim]] cannot possibly
exist as a universal [[law]] of [[nature]] and, consequently, would be
wholly inconsistent with the supreme [[principle]] of all [[duty]].

2. another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow [[money]]. he
knows that he will not be able to repay it, but sees also that nothing
will be lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in a
definite [[time]]. he desires [[desire]] to make this promise, but he has still so
much [[conscience]] as to ask himself: "is it not unlawful and
inconsistent with [[duty]] to get out of a difficulty in this way?"
suppose however that he resolves to do so: then the [[maxim]] of his
action would be expressed thus: "when i [[think]] myself in want of [[money]],
i will borrow [[money]] and promise to repay it, although i [[know]] that i
never can do so." now this [[principle]] of self-love or of one's own
advantage may perhaps be consistent with my whole future welfare;
but the [[question]] now is, "is it [[right]]?" i [[change]] then the suggestion
of self-love into a universal [[law]], and [[state]] the [[question]] thus: "how
would it be if my [[maxim]] were a universal [[law]]?" then i see at once that
it could never hold as a universal [[law]] of [[nature]], but would
necessarily contradict itself. for supposing it to be a universal
law that everyone when he thinks [[think]] himself in a difficulty should be
able to promise whatever he pleases, with the [[purpose]] of not keeping
his promise, the promise itself would become impossible, as well as
the end that one might have in view in it, since no one would consider
that anything was promised to him, but would ridicule all such
statements as [[vain]] pretences.

3. a third finds in himself a talent which with the [[help]] of some
culture might make him a useful [[man]] in many respects [[respect]]. but he finds
himself in comfortable circumstances and prefers to indulge in
pleasure rather than to take pains [[pain]] in enlarging and improving his
happy [[natural]] capacities. he asks, however, whether his [[maxim]] of
neglect of his [[natural]] gifts, besides agreeing with his inclination to
indulgence, agrees also with what is called [[duty]]. he sees then that
a [[system]] of [[nature]] could indeed subsist with such a universal law
although [[men]] (like the south sea islanders) should let their talents
rest and resolve to devote their lives [[life]] merely to idleness,
amusement, and propagation of their species- in a word, to
enjoyment; but he cannot possibly will that this should be a universal
law of [[nature]], or be implanted in us as such by a [[natural]] instinct.
for, as a [[rational]] being, he necessarily wills that his faculties be
developed, since they serve him and have been given him, for all sorts
of possible purposes [[purpose]].

4. a fourth, who is in [[prosperity]], while he sees that others have to
contend with [[great]] wretchedness and that he could [[help]] them, thinks [[think]]:
"what concern is it of mine? let everyone be as [[happy]] as heaven
pleases, or as he can make himself; i will take nothing from him nor
even envy him, only i do not [[wish]] to contribute anything to his
welfare or to his assistance in distress!" now no [[doubt]] if such a mode
of thinking were a universal [[law]], the [[human]] [[race]] might very well
subsist and doubtless even [[better]] than in a [[state]] in which everyone
talks of sympathy and good-will, or even takes [[care]] occasionally to
put it into practice, but, on the other side, also cheats when he can,
betrays the rights [[right]] of [[men]], or otherwise violates them. but although it
is possible that a universal [[law]] of [[nature]] might [[exist]] in accordance
with that [[maxim]], it is impossible to will that such a [[principle]] should
have the universal validity of a [[law]] of [[nature]]. for a will which
resolved this would contradict itself, inasmuch as many cases might
occur in which one would have need of the [[love]] and sympathy of others,
and in which, by such a [[law]] of [[nature]], sprung from his own will, he
would deprive himself of all [[hope]] of the aid he desires [[desire]].

these are a few of the many actual duties [[duty]], or at least what we
regard as such, which obviously fall into two classes on the one
principle that we have laid down. we must be able to will that a maxim
of our action should be a universal [[law]]. this is the canon of the
moral appreciation of the action generally. some actions are of such a
character that their [[maxim]] cannot without contradiction be even
conceived as a universal [[law]] of [[nature]], far from it being possible
that we should will that it should be so. in others this intrinsic
impossibility is not found, but still it is impossible to will that
their [[maxim]] should be raised to the universality of a [[law]] of [[nature]],
since such a will would contradict itself it is easily seen that the
former violate strict or rigorous (inflexible) [[duty]]; the latter only
laxer (meritorious) [[duty]]. thus it has been completely shown how all
duties depend as regards the [[nature]] of the obligation (not the
object of the action) on the same [[principle]].

if now we attend to ourselves on [[occasion]] of any transgression of
duty, we shall find that we in [[fact]] do not will that our maxim
should be a universal [[law]], for that is impossible for us; on the
contrary, we will that the opposite should remain a universal [[law]],
only we assume the [[liberty]] of making an exception in our own favour or
(just for this [[time]] only) in favour of our inclination. consequently
if we considered all cases from one and the same point of view,
namely, that of [[reason]], we should find a contradiction in our own
will, namely, that a [[certain]] [[principle]] should be objectively necessary
as a universal [[law]], and yet subjectively should not be universal,
but admit of exceptions. as however we at one moment regard our action
from the point of view of a will wholly conformed to [[reason]], and
then again look at the same action from the point of view of a will
affected by inclination, there is not really any contradiction, but an
antagonism of inclination to the precept of [[reason]], whereby the
universality of the [[principle]] is changed into a mere generality, so
that the practical [[principle]] of [[reason]] shall meet the [[maxim]] half
way. now, although this cannot be justified in our own impartial
judgement, yet it proves that we do really recognise the validity of
the categorical imperative and (with all [[respect]] for it) only allow
ourselves a few exceptions, which we [[think]] unimportant and forced from
us.

we have thus established at least this much, that if [[duty]] is a
conception which is to have any import and real legislative
authority for our actions, it can only be expressed in categorical and
not at all in hypothetical imperatives. we have also, which is of
great importance, exhibited clearly and definitely for every practical
application the content of the categorical imperative, which must
contain the [[principle]] of all [[duty]] if there is such a thing at all.
we have not yet, however, advanced so far as to prove a priori that
there actually is such an imperative, that there is a practical law
which commands absolutely of itself and without any other impulse, and
that the following of this [[law]] is [[duty]].

with the view of attaining to this, it is of extreme importance to
remember that we must not allow ourselves to [[think]] of deducing the
reality of this [[principle]] from the particular attributes of human
nature. for [[duty]] is to be a practical, unconditional necessity of
action; it must therefore hold for all [[rational]] beings (to whom an
imperative can apply at all), and for this [[reason]] only be also a law
for all [[human]] wills. on the contrary, whatever is deduced from the
particular [[natural]] characteristics of [[humanity]], from certain
feelings and propensions, nay, even, if possible, from any
particular tendency proper to [[human]] [[reason]], and which need not
necessarily hold for the will of every [[rational]] being; this may indeed
supply us with a [[maxim]], but not with a [[law]]; with a subjective
principle on which we may have a propension and inclination to act,
but not with an objective [[principle]] on which we should be enjoined
to act, even though all our propensions, inclinations, and natural
dispositions were opposed to it. in [[fact]], the sublimity and
intrinsic [[dignity]] of the command in [[duty]] are so much the more evident,
the less the subjective impulses favour it and the more they oppose
it, without being able in the slightest [[degree]] to weaken the
obligation of the [[law]] or to diminish its validity.

here then we see [[philosophy]] brought to a critical position, since it
has to be firmly fixed, notwithstanding that it has nothing to support
it in [[heaven]] or [[earth]]. here it must show its purity as absolute
director of its own laws [[law]], not the herald of those which are
whispered to it by an implanted sense or who knows [[know]] what tutelary
nature. although these may be [[better]] than nothing, yet they can
never afford principles [[principle]] dictated by [[reason]], which must have their
source wholly a priori and thence their commanding [[authority]],
expecting everything from the [[supremacy]] of the [[law]] and the due respect
for it, nothing from inclination, or else condemning the [[man]] to
self-contempt and inward abhorrence.

thus every empirical element is not only quite incapable of being an
aid to the [[principle]] of morality, but is even highly prejudicial to
the purity of morals [[moral]], for the proper and inestimable worth of an
absolutely [[good]] will consists just in this, that the [[principle]] of
action is [[free]] from all influence of contingent grounds, which alone
experience can furnish. we cannot too much or too often repeat our
warning against this lax and even mean habit of [[thought]] which seeks
for its [[principle]] amongst empirical motives and laws [[law]]; for [[human]] reason
in its weariness is glad to rest on this pillow, and in a [[dream]] of
sweet illusions (in which, instead of juno, it embraces a cloud) it
substitutes for morality a bastard patched up from limbs of various
derivation, which looks like anything one chooses to see in it, only
not like [[virtue]] to one who has once beheld her in her true form. *



* to behold [[virtue]] in her proper form is nothing else but to
contemplate morality stripped of all admixture of sensible things
and of every spurious ornament of [[reward]] or self-love. how much she
then eclipses everything else that appears charming to the affections,
every one may readily perceive with the least exertion of his
reason, if it be not wholly spoiled for abstraction.



the [[question]] then is this: "is it a necessary [[law]] for all rational
beings that they should always [[judge]] of their actions by maxims [[maxim]] of
which they can themselves will that they should serve as universal
laws?" if it is so, then it must be connected (altogether a priori)
with the very conception of the will of a [[rational]] being generally.
but in order to discover this connexion we must, however
reluctantly, take a step into metaphysic, although into a domain of it
which is distinct from speculative [[philosophy]], namely, the
metaphysic of morals [[moral]]. in a practical [[philosophy]], where it is not the
reasons of what happens that we have to ascertain, but the laws [[law]] of
what ought to happen, even although it never does, i.e., objective
practical laws [[law]], there it is not necessary to inquire into the
reasons why anything pleases or displeases, how the [[pleasure]] of mere
sensation differs from taste, and whether the latter is distinct
from a general satisfaction of [[reason]]; on what the feeling of pleasure
or [[pain]] rests, and how from it desires [[desire]] and inclinations arise, and
from these again maxims [[maxim]] by the co-operation of [[reason]]: for all this
belongs to an empirical psychology, which would constitute the
second part of physics, if we regard physics as the [[philosophy]] of
nature, so far as it is based on empirical laws [[law]]. but here we are
concerned with objective practical laws [[law]] and, consequently, with the
relation of the will to itself so far as it is determined by reason
alone, in which case whatever has reference to anything empirical is
necessarily excluded; since if [[reason]] of itself alone determines the
conduct (and it is the possibility of this that we are now
investigating), it must necessarily do so a priori.

the will is conceived as a faculty of determining oneself to
action in accordance with the conception of [[certain]] laws [[law]]. and such a
faculty can be found only in [[rational]] beings. now that which serves
the will as the objective ground of its self-determination is the end,
and, if this is assigned by [[reason]] alone, it must hold for all
rational beings. on the other hand, that which merely contains the
ground of possibility of the action of which the effect is the end,
this is called the means. the subjective ground of the [[desire]] is the
spring, the objective ground of the volition is the motive; hence
the distinction between subjective ends which rest on springs, and
objective ends which depend on motives valid for every [[rational]] being.
practical principles [[principle]] are formal when they abstract from all subjective
ends; they are material when they assume these, and therefore
particular springs of action. the ends which a [[rational]] being proposes
to himself at [[pleasure]] as effects of his actions (material ends) are
all only relative, for it is only their relation to the particular
desires of the [[subject]] that gives them their worth, which therefore
cannot furnish principles [[principle]] universal and necessary for all rational
beings and for every volition, that is to say practical laws [[law]]. hence
all these relative ends can give rise only to hypothetical
imperatives.

supposing, however, that there were something whose existence has in
itself an absolute worth, something which, being an end in itself,
could be a source of definite laws [[law]]; then in this and this alone
would [[lie]] the source of a possible categorical imperative, i.e., a
practical [[law]].

now i say: [[man]] and generally any [[rational]] being exists as an end
in himself, not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or
that will, but in all his actions, whether they concern himself or
other [[rational]] beings, must be always regarded at the same [[time]] as
an end. all objects of the inclinations have only a conditional worth,
for if the inclinations and the wants founded on them did not [[exist]],
then their object would be without value. but the inclinations,
themselves being sources of want, are so far from having an absolute
worth for which they should be [[desired]] that on the contrary it must be
the universal [[wish]] of every [[rational]] being to be wholly [[free]] from
them. thus the worth of any object which is to be acquired by our
action is always conditional. beings whose existence depends not on
our will but on nature's, have nevertheless, if they are irrational
beings, only a relative value as means, and are therefore called
things; [[rational]] beings, on the contrary, are called persons [[person]],
because their very [[nature]] points them out as ends in themselves,
that is as something which must not be used merely as means, and so
far therefore restricts [[freedom]] of action (and is an object of
respect). these, therefore, are not merely subjective ends whose
existence has a worth for us as an effect of our action, but objective
ends, that is, things whose existence is an end in itself; an end
moreover for which no other can be substituted, which they should
subserve merely as means, for otherwise nothing whatever would possess
absolute worth; but if all worth were conditioned and therefore
contingent, then there would be no supreme practical [[principle]] of
reason whatever.

if then there is a supreme practical [[principle]] or, in [[respect]] of the
human will, a categorical imperative, it must be one which, being
drawn from the conception of that which is necessarily an end for
everyone because it is an end in itself, constitutes an objective
principle of will, and can therefore serve as a universal practical
law. the foundation of this [[principle]] is: [[rational]] [[nature]] exists as an
end in itself. [[man]] necessarily conceives his own existence as being
so; so far then this is a subjective [[principle]] of [[human]] actions. but
every other [[rational]] being regards its existence similarly, just on
the same [[rational]] [[principle]] that holds for me: * so that it is at the
same [[time]] an objective [[principle]], from which as a supreme practical
law all laws [[law]] of the will must be capable of being deduced. accordingly
the practical imperative will be as follows: so act as to treat
humanity, whether in thine own [[person]] or in that of any other, in
every case as an end withal, never as means only. we will now
inquire whether this can be practically carried out.



* this proposition is here stated as a postulate. the ground of it
will be found in the concluding section.



to abide by the previous examples [[example]]:

firstly, under the head of necessary [[duty]] to oneself: he who
contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be
consistent with the [[idea]] of [[humanity]] as an end in itself. if he
destroys himself in order to escape from painful circumstances, he
uses a [[person]] merely as a mean to maintain a tolerable condition up to
the end of [[life]]. but a [[man]] is not a thing, that is to say, something
which can be used merely as means, but must in all his actions be
always considered as an end in himself. i cannot, therefore, dispose
in any way of a [[man]] in my own [[person]] so as to mutilate him, to
damage or kill him. (it belongs to ethics proper to define this
principle more precisely, so as to avoid all misunderstanding, e.
g., as to the amputation of the limbs in order to preserve myself,
as to exposing my [[life]] to danger with a view to preserve it, etc. this
question is therefore omitted here.)

secondly, as regards necessary duties [[duty]], or those of strict
obligation, towards others: he who is thinking of making a lying
promise to others will see at once that he would be using another
man merely as a mean, without the latter containing at the same time
the end in himself. for he whom i propose by such a promise to use for
my own purposes [[purpose]] cannot possibly assent to my mode of acting towards
him and, therefore, cannot himself contain the end of this action.
this violation of the [[principle]] of [[humanity]] in other [[men]] is more
obvious if we take in examples [[example]] of attacks on the [[freedom]] and
property of others. for then it is clear that he who transgresses
the rights [[right]] of [[men]] intends to use the [[person]] of others merely as a
means, without considering that as [[rational]] beings they ought always
to be esteemed also as ends, that is, as beings who must be capable of
containing in themselves the end of the very same action. *



* let it not be [[thought]] that the [[common]] "quod tibi non vis fieri,
etc." could serve here as the [[rule]] or [[principle]]. for it is only a
deduction from the former, though with several limitations; it
cannot be a universal [[law]], for it does not contain the [[principle]] of
duties to oneself, nor of the duties [[duty]] of benevolence to others (for
many a one would gladly [[consent]] that others should not benefit him,
provided only that he might be excused from showing benevolence to
them), nor finally that of duties [[duty]] of strict obligation to one another,
for on this [[principle]] the [[criminal]] might argue against the [[judge]] who
punishes him, and so on.



thirdly, as regards contingent (meritorious) duties [[duty]] to oneself: it
is not enough that the action does not violate [[humanity]] in our own
person as an end in itself, it must also harmonize with it. now
there are in [[humanity]] capacities of greater [[perfection]], which belong
to the end that [[nature]] has in view in regard to [[humanity]] in
ourselves as the [[subject]]: to neglect these might perhaps be consistent
with the maintenance of [[humanity]] as an end in itself, but not with the
advancement of this end.

fourthly, as regards meritorious duties [[duty]] towards others: the
natural end which all [[men]] have is their own [[happiness]]. now humanity
might indeed subsist, although no one should contribute anything to
the [[happiness]] of others, provided he did not intentionally withdraw
anything from it; but after all this would only harmonize negatively
not positively with [[humanity]] as an end in itself, if every one does
not also endeavour, as far as in him lies [[lie]], to forward the ends of
others. for the ends of any [[subject]] which is an end in himself ought
as far as possible to be my ends also, if that conception is to have
its full effect with me.

this [[principle]], that [[humanity]] and generally every [[rational]] [[nature]] is
an end in itself (which is the supreme limiting condition of every
man's [[freedom]] of action), is not borrowed from [[experience]], firstly,
because it is universal, applying as it does to all [[rational]] beings
whatever, and [[experience]] is not capable of determining anything
about them; secondly, because it does not [[present]] [[humanity]] as an end
to [[men]] (subjectively), that is as an object which [[men]] do of themselves
actually adopt as an end; but as an objective end, which must as a law
constitute the supreme limiting condition of all our subjective
ends, let them be what we will; it must therefore spring from pure
reason. in [[fact]] the objective [[principle]] of all practical legislation
lies (according to the first principle) in the [[rule]] and its form of
universality which makes it capable of being a [[law]] (say, e. g., a
law of nature); but the subjective [[principle]] is in the end; now by the
second [[principle]] the [[subject]] of all ends is each [[rational]] being,
inasmuch as it is an end in itself. hence follows the third
practical [[principle]] of the will, which is the ultimate condition of
its harmony with universal practical [[reason]], viz.: the [[idea]] of the
will of every [[rational]] being as a universally legislative will.

on this [[principle]] all maxims [[maxim]] are rejected which are inconsistent
with the will being itself universal legislator. thus the will is
not [[subject]] simply to the [[law]], but so [[subject]] that it must be regarded
as itself giving the [[law]] and, on this ground only, [[subject]] to the
law (of which it can regard itself as the author).

in the previous imperatives, namely, that based on the conception of
the conformity of actions to general laws [[law]], as in a physical system
of [[nature]], and that based on the universal prerogative of rational
beings as ends in themselves- these imperatives, just because they
were conceived as categorical, excluded from any share in their
authority all admixture of any interest as a spring of action; they
were, however, only assumed to be categorical, because such an
assumption was necessary to explain the conception of [[duty]]. but we
could not prove independently that there are practical propositions
which command categorically, nor can it be proved in this section; one
thing, however, could be done, namely, to indicate in the imperative
itself, by some determinate expression, that in the case of volition
from [[duty]] all interest is renounced, which is the specific criterion
of categorical as distinguished from hypothetical imperatives. this is
done in the [[present]] (third) formula of the [[principle]], namely, in the
idea of the will of every [[rational]] being as a universally
legislating will.

for although a will which is [[subject]] to laws [[law]] may be attached to this
law by means of an interest, yet a will which is itself a supreme
lawgiver so far as it is such cannot possibly depend on any
interest, since a will so dependent would itself still need another
law restricting the interest of its self-love by the condition that it
should be valid as universal [[law]].

thus the [[principle]] that every [[human]] will is a will which in all
its maxims [[maxim]] gives universal laws [[law]], * provided it be otherwise
justified, would be very well adapted to be the categorical
imperative, in this [[respect]], namely, that just because of the idea
of universal legislation it is not based on interest, and therefore it
alone among all possible imperatives can be unconditional. or still
better, converting the proposition, if there is a categorical
imperative (i.e., a [[law]] for the will of every [[rational]] being), it
can only command that everything be done from maxims [[maxim]] of one's will
regarded as a will which could at the same [[time]] will that it should
itself give universal laws [[law]], for in that case only the practical
principle and the imperative which it obeys are unconditional, since
they cannot be based on any interest.



* i may be excused from adducing examples [[example]] to elucidate this
principle, as those which have already been used to elucidate the
categorical imperative and its formula would all serve for the like
purpose here.



looking back now on all previous attempts to discover the
principle of morality, we need not wonder why they all failed. it
was seen that [[man]] was bound to laws [[law]] by [[duty]], but it was not observed
that the laws [[law]] to which he is [[subject]] are only those of his own giving,
though at the same [[time]] they are universal, and that he is only
bound to act in conformity with his own will; a will, however, which
is designed by [[nature]] to give universal laws [[law]]. for when one has
conceived [[man]] only as [[subject]] to a [[law]] (no matter what), then this law
required some interest, either by way of attraction or constraint,
since it did not originate as a [[law]] from his own will, but this will
was according to a [[law]] obliged by something else to act in a certain
manner. now by this necessary consequence all the [[labour]] spent in
finding a supreme [[principle]] of [[duty]] was irrevocably lost. for men
never elicited [[duty]], but only a necessity of acting from a certain
interest. whether this interest was private or otherwise, in any
case the imperative must be conditional and could not by any means
be capable of being a [[moral]] command. i will therefore call this the
principle of autonomy of the will, in contrast with every other
which i accordingly reckon as heteronomy.

the conception of the will of every [[rational]] being as one which must
consider itself as giving in all the maxims [[maxim]] of its will universal
laws, so as to [[judge]] itself and its actions from this point of view-
this conception leads to another which depends on it and is very
fruitful, namely that of a [[kingdom]] of ends.

by a [[kingdom]] i [[understand]] the union of different [[rational]] beings
in a [[system]] by [[common]] laws [[law]]. now since it is by laws [[law]] that ends are
determined as regards their universal validity, hence, if we
abstract from the personal differences of [[rational]] beings and likewise
from all the content of their private ends, we shall be able to
conceive all ends combined in a systematic whole (including both
rational beings as ends in themselves, and also the special ends which
each may propose to himself), that is to say, we can conceive a
kingdom of ends, which on the preceding principles [[principle]] is possible.

for all [[rational]] beings come under the [[law]] that each of them must
treat itself and all others never merely as means, but in every case
at the same [[time]] as ends in themselves. hence results a systematic
union of [[rational]] being by [[common]] objective laws [[law]], i.e., a kingdom
which may be called a [[kingdom]] of ends, since what these laws [[law]] have in
view is just the relation of these beings to one another as ends and
means. it is certainly only an ideal.

a [[rational]] being belongs as a member to the [[kingdom]] of ends when,
although giving universal laws [[law]] in it, he is also himself [[subject]] to
these laws [[law]]. he belongs to it as [[sovereign]] when, while giving laws [[law]],
he is not [[subject]] to the will of any other.

a [[rational]] being must always regard himself as giving laws [[law]] either as
member or as [[sovereign]] in a [[kingdom]] of ends which is rendered possible
by the [[freedom]] of will. he cannot, however, maintain the latter
position merely by the maxims [[maxim]] of his will, but only in case he is a
completely independent being without wants and with unrestricted power
adequate to his will.

morality consists then in the reference of all action to the
legislation which alone can render a [[kingdom]] of ends possible. this
legislation must be capable of existing in every [[rational]] being and of
emanating from his will, so that the [[principle]] of this will is never
to act on any [[maxim]] which could not without contradiction be also a
universal [[law]] and, accordingly, always so to act that the will could
at the same [[time]] regard itself as giving in its maxims [[maxim]] universal laws [[law]].
if now the maxims [[maxim]] of [[rational]] beings are not by their own nature
coincident with this objective [[principle]], then the necessity of acting
on it is called practical necessitation, i.e., [[duty]]. [[duty]] does not
apply to the [[sovereign]] in the [[kingdom]] of ends, but it does to every
member of it and to all in the same [[degree]].

the practical necessity of acting on this [[principle]], i.e., [[duty]],
does not rest at all on feelings, impulses, or inclinations, but
solely on the relation of [[rational]] beings to one another, a relation
in which the will of a [[rational]] being must always be regarded as
legislative, since otherwise it could not be conceived as an end in
itself. [[reason]] then refers every [[maxim]] of the will, regarding it as
legislating universally, to every other will and also to every
action towards oneself; and this not on account of any other practical
motive or any future advantage, but from the [[idea]] of the [[dignity]] of
a [[rational]] being, obeying no [[law]] but that which he himself also gives.

in the [[kingdom]] of ends everything has either value or [[dignity]].
whatever has a value can be replaced by something else which is
equivalent; whatever, on the other hand, is above all value, and
therefore admits of no equivalent, has a [[dignity]].

whatever has reference to the general inclinations and wants of
mankind has a market value; whatever, without presupposing a want,
corresponds to a [[certain]] taste, that is to a satisfaction in the
mere purposeless play of our faculties, has a fancy value; but that
which constitutes the condition under which alone anything can be an
end in itself, this has not merely a relative worth, i.e., value,
but an intrinsic worth, that is, [[dignity]].

now morality is the condition under which alone a [[rational]] being can
be an end in himself, since by this alone is it possible that he
should be a legislating member in the [[kingdom]] of ends. thus
morality, and [[humanity]] as capable of it, is that which alone has
dignity. [[skill]] and diligence in [[labour]] have a market value; wit,
lively [[imagination]], and [[humour]], have fancy value; on the other hand,
fidelity to promises, benevolence from [[principle]] (not from
instinct), have an intrinsic worth. neither [[nature]] nor art [[arts]] contains
anything which in default of these it could put in their place, for
their worth consists not in the effects which spring from them, not in
the use and advantage which they secure, but in the disposition of
mind, that is, the maxims [[maxim]] of the will which are ready to manifest
themselves in such actions, even though they should not have the
desired effect. these actions also need no recommendation from any
subjective taste or sentiment, that they may be looked on with
immediate favour and satisfaction: they need no immediate propension
or feeling for them; they exhibit the will that performs them as an
object of an immediate [[respect]], and nothing but [[reason]] is required
to impose them on the will; not to flatter it into them, which, in the
case of duties [[duty]], would be a contradiction. this estimation therefore
shows that the worth of such a disposition is [[dignity]], and places it
infinitely above all value, with which it cannot for a moment be
brought into comparison or competition without as it were violating
its [[sanctity]].

what then is it which justifies [[virtue]] or the morally good
disposition, in making such lofty claims? it is nothing less than
the [[privilege]] it secures to the [[rational]] being of participating in the
giving of universal laws [[law]], by which it qualifies him to be a member
of a possible [[kingdom]] of ends, a [[privilege]] to which he was already
destined by his own [[nature]] as being an end in himself and, on that
account, legislating in the [[kingdom]] of ends; [[free]] as regards all
laws of physical [[nature]], and obeying those only which he himself
gives, and by which his maxims [[maxim]] can belong to a [[system]] of universal
law, to which at the same [[time]] he submits himself. for nothing has any
worth except what the [[law]] assigns it. now the legislation itself which
assigns the worth of everything must for that very [[reason]] possess
dignity, that is an unconditional incomparable worth; and the word
respect alone supplies a becoming expression for the esteem which a
rational being must have for it. autonomy then is the basis of the
dignity of [[human]] and of every [[rational]] [[nature]].

the three modes of presenting the [[principle]] of morality that have
been adduced are at bottom only so many formulae of the very same [[law]],
and each of itself involves the other two. there is, however, a
difference in them, but it is rather subjectively than objectively
practical, intended namely to bring an [[idea]] of the [[reason]] nearer to
intuition (by means of a [[certain]] analogy) and thereby nearer to
feeling. all maxims [[maxim]], in [[fact]], have:

1. a form, consisting in universality; and in this view the
formula of the [[moral]] imperative is expressed thus, that the maxims
must be so chosen as if they were to serve as universal laws [[law]] of
nature.

2. a matter, namely, an end, and here the formula says that the
rational being, as it is an end by its own [[nature]] and therefore an end
in itself, must in every [[maxim]] serve as the condition limiting all
merely relative and arbitrary ends.

3. a complete characterization of all maxims [[maxim]] by means of that
formula, namely, that all maxims [[maxim]] ought by their own legislation to
harmonize with a possible [[kingdom]] of ends as with a [[kingdom]] of
nature. * there is a [[progress]] here in the order of the categories of
unity of the form of the will (its universality), plurality of the
matter (the objects, i.e., the ends), and totality of the [[system]] of
these. in forming our [[moral]] judgement of actions, it is [[better]] to
proceed always on the strict method and start from the general formula
of the categorical imperative: act according to a [[maxim]] which can at
the same [[time]] make itself a universal [[law]]. if, however, we [[wish]] to
gain an entrance for the [[moral]] [[law]], it is very useful to bring one and
the same action under the three specified conceptions, and thereby
as far as possible to bring it nearer to intuition.



* teleology considers [[nature]] as a [[kingdom]] of ends; ethics regards a
possible [[kingdom]] of ends as a [[kingdom]] [[nature]]. in the first case, the
kingdom of ends is a theoretical [[idea]], adopted to explain what
actually is. in the latter it is a practical [[idea]], adopted to bring
about that which is not yet, but which can be realized by our conduct,
namely, if it conforms to this [[idea]].



we can now end where we started at the beginning, namely, with the
conception of a will unconditionally [[good]]. that will is absolutely
good which cannot be evil- in other words, whose [[maxim]], if made a
universal [[law]], could never contradict itself. this [[principle]], then, is
its supreme [[law]]: "act always on such a [[maxim]] as thou canst at the same
time will to be a universal law"; this is the sole condition under
which a will can never contradict itself; and such an imperative is
categorical. since the validity of the will as a universal [[law]] for
possible actions is analogous to the universal connexion of the
existence of things by general laws [[law]], which is the formal notion of
nature in general, the categorical imperative can also be expressed
thus: act on maxims [[maxim]] which can at the same [[time]] have for their object
themselves as universal laws [[law]] of [[nature]]. such then is the formula of an
absolutely [[good]] will.

rational [[nature]] is distinguished from the rest of [[nature]] by this,
that it sets before itself an end. this end would be the matter of
every [[good]] will. but since in the [[idea]] of a will that is absolutely
good without being limited by any condition (of attaining this or that
end) we must abstract wholly from every end to be effected (since this
would make every will only relatively good), it follows that in this
case the end must be conceived, not as an end to be effected, but as
an independently existing end. consequently it is conceived only
negatively, i.e., as that which we must never act against and which,
therefore, must never be regarded merely as means, but must in every
volition be esteemed as an end likewise. now this end can be nothing
but the [[subject]] of all possible ends, since this is also the subject
of a possible absolutely [[good]] will; for such a will cannot without
contradiction be postponed to any other object. the [[principle]]: "so act
in regard to every [[rational]] being (thyself and others), that he may
always have place in thy [[maxim]] as an end in himself," is accordingly
essentially identical with this other: "act upon a [[maxim]] which, at the
same [[time]], involves its own universal validity for every rational
being." for that in using means for every end i should limit my
maxim by the condition of its holding [[good]] as a [[law]] for every [[subject]],
this comes to the same thing as that the fundamental [[principle]] of
all maxims [[maxim]] of action must be that the [[subject]] of all ends, i.e., the
rational being himself, be never employed merely as means, but as
the supreme condition restricting the use of all means, that is in
every case as an end likewise.

it follows incontestably that, to whatever laws [[law]] any [[rational]] being
may be [[subject]], he being an end in himself must be able to regard
himself as also legislating universally in [[respect]] of these same laws [[law]],
since it is just this fitness of his maxims [[maxim]] for universal
legislation that distinguishes him as an end in himself; also it
follows that this implies his [[dignity]] (prerogative) above all mere
physical beings, that he must always take his maxims [[maxim]] from the point of
view which regards himself and, likewise, every other [[rational]] being
as law-giving beings (on which account they are called persons). in
this way a [[world]] of [[rational]] beings (mundus intelligibilis) is
possible as a [[kingdom]] of ends, and this by [[virtue]] of the legislation
proper to all persons [[person]] as members. therefore every [[rational]] being
must so act as if he were by his maxims [[maxim]] in every case a legislating
member in the universal [[kingdom]] of ends. the formal [[principle]] of these
maxims is: "so act as if thy [[maxim]] were to serve likewise as the
universal [[law]] (of all [[rational]] beings)." a [[kingdom]] of ends is thus
only possible on the analogy of a [[kingdom]] of [[nature]], the former
however only by maxims [[maxim]], that is self-imposed rules [[rule]], the latter only by
the laws [[law]] of efficient causes acting under necessitation from
without. nevertheless, although the [[system]] of [[nature]] is looked upon as
a machine, yet so far as it has reference to [[rational]] beings as its
ends, it is given on this account the name of a [[kingdom]] of [[nature]]. now
such a [[kingdom]] of ends would be actually realized by means of maxims
conforming to the canon which the categorical imperative prescribes to
all [[rational]] beings, if they were universally followed. but although a
rational being, even if he punctually follows this [[maxim]] himself,
cannot reckon upon all others being therefore true to the same, nor
expect that the [[kingdom]] of [[nature]] and its orderly arrangements shall
be in harmony with him as a fitting member, so as to form a [[kingdom]] of
ends to which he himself contributes, that is to say, that it shall
favour his expectation of [[happiness]], still that [[law]]: "act according to
the maxims [[maxim]] of a member of a merely possible [[kingdom]] of ends
legislating in it universally," remains in its full [[force]], inasmuch as
it commands categorically. and it is just in this that the paradox
lies; that the mere [[dignity]] of [[man]] as a [[rational]] creature, without any
other end or advantage to be attained thereby, in other words, respect
for a mere [[idea]], should yet serve as an inflexible precept of the
will, and that it is precisely in this independence of the [[maxim]] on
all such springs of action that its sublimity consists; and it is this
that makes every [[rational]] [[subject]] worthy to be a legislative member in
the [[kingdom]] of ends: for otherwise he would have to be conceived
only as [[subject]] to the physical [[law]] of his wants. and although we
should suppose the [[kingdom]] of [[nature]] and the [[kingdom]] of ends to be
united under one [[sovereign]], so that the latter [[kingdom]] thereby
ceased to be a mere [[idea]] and acquired true reality, then it would no
doubt gain the accession of a [[strong]] spring, but by no means any
increase of its intrinsic worth. for this sole absolute lawgiver must,
notwithstanding this, be always conceived as estimating the worth of
rational beings only by their disinterested behaviour, as prescribed
to themselves from that [[idea]] [the [[dignity]] of man] alone. the essence
of things is not altered by their external relations, and that
which, abstracting from these, alone constitutes the absolute worth of
man, is also that by which he must be judged, whoever the [[judge]] may
be, and even by the supreme being. morality, then, is the relation
of actions to the relation of actions will, that is, to the autonomy
of potential universal legislation by its maxims [[maxim]]. an action that is
consistent with the autonomy of the will is permitted; one that does
not agree therewith is forbidden. a will whose maxims [[maxim]] necessarily
coincide with the laws [[law]] of autonomy is a holy will, [[good]] absolutely.
the dependence of a will not absolutely [[good]] on the [[principle]] of
autonomy (moral necessitation) is obligation. this, then, cannot be
applied to a holy being. the objective necessity of actions from
obligation is called [[duty]].

from what has just been said, it is easy to see how it happens that,
although the conception of [[duty]] implies subjection to the [[law]], we
yet ascribe a [[certain]] [[dignity]] and sublimity to the [[person]] who
fulfils all his duties [[duty]]. there is not, indeed, any sublimity in him, so
far as he is [[subject]] to the [[moral]] [[law]]; but inasmuch as in regard to
that very [[law]] he is likewise a legislator, and on that account alone
subject to it, he has sublimity. we have also shown above that neither
fear nor inclination, but simply [[respect]] for the [[law]], is the spring
which can give actions a [[moral]] worth. our own will, so far as we
suppose it to act only under the condition that its maxims [[maxim]] are
potentially universal laws [[law]], this ideal will which is possible to us is
the proper object of [[respect]]; and the [[dignity]] of [[humanity]] consists
just in this capacity of being universally legislative, though with
the condition that it is itself [[subject]] to this same legislation.



the autonomy of the will as the supreme [[principle]] of morality



autonomy of the will is that [[property]] of it by which it is a law
to itself (independently of any [[property]] of the objects of
volition). the [[principle]] of autonomy then is: "always so to choose
that the same volition shall comprehend the maxims [[maxim]] of our [[choice]] as
a universal [[law]]." we cannot prove that this practical [[rule]] is an
imperative, i.e., that the will of every [[rational]] being is necessarily
bound to it as a condition, by a mere analysis of the conceptions
which occur in it, since it is a synthetical proposition; we must
advance beyond the cognition of the objects to a critical
examination of the [[subject]], that is, of the pure practical [[reason]], for
this synthetic proposition which commands apodeictically must be
capable of being cognized wholly a priori. this matter, however,
does not belong to the [[present]] section. but that the [[principle]] of
autonomy in [[question]] is the sole [[principle]] of morals [[moral]] can be readily
shown by mere analysis of the conceptions of morality. for by this
analysis we find that its [[principle]] must be a categorical imperative
and that what this commands is neither more nor less than this very
autonomy.



heteronomy of the will as the source of all spurious principles

                        of morality



if the will seeks the [[law]] which is to determine it anywhere else
than in the fitness of its maxims [[maxim]] to be universal laws [[law]] of its own
dictation, consequently if it goes out of itself and seeks this [[law]] in
the [[character]] of any of its objects, there always results
heteronomy. the will in that case does not give itself the [[law]], but it
is given by the object through its relation to the will. this
relation, whether it rests on inclination or on conceptions of [[reason]],
only admits of hypothetical imperatives: "i ought to do something
because i [[wish]] for something else." on the contrary, the [[moral]], and
therefore categorical, imperative says: "i ought to do so and so, even
though i should not [[wish]] for anything else." e.g., the former says: "i
ought not to [[lie]], if i would retain my reputation"; the latter says:
"i ought not to [[lie]], although it should not bring me the least
discredit." the latter therefore must so far abstract from all objects
that they shall have no influence on the will, in order that practical
reason (will) may not be restricted to administering an interest not
belonging to it, but may simply show its own commanding [[authority]] as
the supreme legislation. thus, e.g., i ought to endeavour to promote
the [[happiness]] of others, not as if its realization involved any
concern of mine (whether by immediate inclination or by any
satisfaction indirectly gained through reason), but simply because a
maxim which excludes it cannot be comprehended as a universal [[law]] in
one and the same volition.



  classification of all principles [[principle]] of morality which can be

         founded on the conception of heteronomy



here as elsewhere [[human]] [[reason]] in its pure use, so long as it was
not critically examined, has first tried all possible [[wrong]] ways
before it succeeded in finding the one true way.

all principles [[principle]] which can be taken from this point of view are either
empirical or [[rational]]. the former, drawn from the [[principle]] of
happiness, are built on physical or [[moral]] feelings; the latter,
drawn from the [[principle]] of [[perfection]], are built either on the
rational conception of [[perfection]] as a possible effect, or on that
of an independent [[perfection]] (the will of god) as the determining
cause of our will.

empirical principles [[principle]] are wholly incapable of serving as a foundation
for [[moral]] laws [[law]]. for the universality with which these should hold
for all [[rational]] beings without distinction, the unconditional
practical necessity which is thereby imposed on them, is lost when
their foundation is taken from the particular [[constitution]] of human
nature, or the accidental circumstances in which it is placed. the
principle of private [[happiness]], however, is the most objectionable,
not merely because it is false, and [[experience]] contradicts the
supposition that [[prosperity]] is always proportioned to [[good]] conduct,
nor yet merely because it contributes nothing to the establishment
of morality- since it is quite a different thing to make a
prosperous [[man]] and a [[good]] [[man]], or to make one prudent and
sharp-sighted for his own interests and to make him virtuous- but
because the springs it provides for morality are such as rather
undermine it and [[destroy]] its sublimity, since they put the motives
to [[virtue]] and to [[vice]] in the same class and only [[teach]] us to make a
better calculation, the specific difference between [[virtue]] and vice
being entirely extinguished. on the other hand, as to [[moral]] feeling,
this supposed special sense, * the appeal to it is indeed superficial
when those who cannot [[think]] [[believe]] that feeling will [[help]] them out,
even in what concerns general laws [[law]]: and besides, feelings, which
naturally differ infinitely in [[degree]], cannot furnish a uniform
standard of [[good]] and [[evil]], nor has anyone a [[right]] to form judgements
for others by his own feelings: nevertheless this [[moral]] feeling is
nearer to morality and its [[dignity]] in this [[respect]], that it pays
virtue the [[honour]] of ascribing to her immediately the satisfaction and
esteem we have for her and does not, as it were, tell her to her
face that we are not attached to her by her [[beauty]] but by [[profit]].



* i class the [[principle]] of [[moral]] feeling under that of [[happiness]],
because every empirical interest promises to contribute to our
well-being by the agreeableness that a thing affords, whether it be
immediately and without a view to [[profit]], or whether [[profit]] be
regarded. we must likewise, with hutcheson, class the [[principle]] of
sympathy with the [[happiness]] of others under his assumed [[moral]] sense.



amongst the [[rational]] principles [[principle]] of morality, the ontological
conception of [[perfection]], notwithstanding its defects, is better
than the theological conception which derives morality from a divine
absolutely [[perfect]] will. the former is, no [[doubt]], empty and indefinite
and consequently useless for finding in the boundless field of
possible reality the [[greatest]] amount suitable for us; moreover, in
attempting to distinguish specifically the reality of which we are now
speaking from every other, it inevitably tends to turn in a circle and
cannot avoid tacitly presupposing the morality which it is to explain;
it is nevertheless preferable to the theological view, first,
because we have no intuition of the [[divine]] [[perfection]] and can only
deduce it from our own conceptions, the most important of which is
that of morality, and our explanation would thus be involved in a
gross circle; and, in the next place, if we avoid this, the only
notion of the [[divine]] will remaining to us is a conception made up of
the attributes of [[desire]] of [[glory]] and dominion, combined with the
awful conceptions of might and vengeance, and any [[system]] of morals
erected on this foundation would be directly opposed to morality.

however, if i had to choose between the notion of the [[moral]] sense
and that of [[perfection]] in general (two systems [[system]] which at least do not
weaken morality, although they are totally incapable of serving as its
foundation), then i should decide for the latter, because it at
least withdraws the decision of the [[question]] from the sensibility
and brings it to the court of pure [[reason]]; and although even here it
decides nothing, it at all events preserves the indefinite [[idea]] (of
a will [[good]] in itself [[free]] from [[corruption]], until it shall be more
precisely defined.

for the rest i [[think]] i may be excused here from a detailed
refutation of all these doctrines; that would only be superfluous
labour, since it is so easy, and is probably so well seen even by
those whose office requires them to decide for one of these theories
(because their hearers would not tolerate suspension of judgement).
but what interests us more here is to [[know]] that the prime foundation
of morality laid down by all these principles [[principle]] is nothing but
heteronomy of the will, and for this [[reason]] they must necessarily miss
their aim.

in every case where an object of the will has to be supposed, in
order that the [[rule]] may be prescribed which is to determine the
will, there the [[rule]] is simply heteronomy; the imperative is
conditional, namely, if or because one wishes [[wish]] for this object, one
should act so and so: hence it can never command morally, that is,
categorically. whether the object determines the will by means of
inclination, as in the [[principle]] of private [[happiness]], or by means
of [[reason]] directed to objects of our possible volition generally, as
in the [[principle]] of [[perfection]], in either case the will never
determines itself immediately by the conception of the action, but
only by the influence which the foreseen effect of the action has on
the will; i ought to do something, on this account, because i [[wish]] for
something else; and here there must be yet another [[law]] assumed in me
as its [[subject]], by which i necessarily will this other thing, and this
law again requires an imperative to restrict this [[maxim]]. for the
influence which the conception of an object within the reach of our
faculties can exercise on the will of the [[subject]], in consequence of
its [[natural]] properties [[property]], depends on the [[nature]] of the [[subject]], either
the sensibility (inclination and taste), or the understanding and
reason, the employment of which is by the peculiar [[constitution]] of
their [[nature]] attended with satisfaction. it follows that the [[law]] would
be, properly speaking, given by [[nature]], and, as such, it must be known
and proved by [[experience]] and would consequently be contingent and
therefore incapable of being an apodeictic practical [[rule]], such as the
moral [[rule]] must be. not only so, but it is inevitably only heteronomy;
the will does not give itself the [[law]], but is given by a foreign
impulse by means of a particular [[natural]] [[constitution]] of the subject
adapted to receive it. an absolutely [[good]] will, then, the [[principle]] of
which must be a categorical imperative, will be indeterminate as
regards all objects and will contain merely the form of volition
generally, and that as autonomy, that is to say, the capability of the
maxims of every [[good]] will to make themselves a universal [[law]], is
itself the only [[law]] which the will of every [[rational]] being imposes
on itself, without needing to assume any spring or interest as a
foundation.

how such a synthetical practical a priori proposition is possible,
and why it is necessary, is a problem whose solution does not lie
within the bounds of the metaphysic of morals [[moral]]; and we have not here
affirmed its [[truth]], much less professed to have a proof of it in our
power. we simply showed by the [[development]] of the universally received
notion of morality that an autonomy of the will is inevitably
connected with it, or rather is its foundation. whoever then holds
morality to be anything real, and not a chimerical [[idea]] without any
truth, must likewise admit the [[principle]] of it that is here
assigned. this section then, like the first, was merely analytical.
now to prove that morality is no creation of the brain, which it
cannot be if the categorical imperative and with it the autonomy of
the will is true, and as an a priori [[principle]] absolutely necessary,
this supposes the possibility of a synthetic use of pure practical
reason, which however we cannot venture on without first giving a
critical examination of this faculty of [[reason]]. in the concluding
section we shall give the principal outlines of this critical
examination as far as is sufficient for our [[purpose]].

                     third section



      transition from the metaphysic of morals [[moral]] to the

           critique of pure practical reason



the concept of [[freedom]] is the key that explains the autonomy of
the will



the will is a [[kind]] of causality belonging to living beings in so far
as they are [[rational]], and [[freedom]] would be this [[property]] of such
causality that it can be efficient, independently of [[foreign]] causes
determining it; just as physical necessity is the [[property]] that the
causality of all irrational beings has of being determined to activity
by the influence of [[foreign]] causes.

the preceding definition of [[freedom]] is negative and therefore
unfruitful for the discovery of its essence, but it leads to a
positive conception which is so much the more full and fruitful.

since the conception of causality involves that of laws [[law]], according
to which, by something that we call cause, something else, namely
the effect, must be produced; hence, although [[freedom]] is not a
property of the will depending on physical laws [[law]], yet it is not for
that [[reason]] lawless; on the contrary it must be a causality acting
according to immutable laws [[law]], but of a peculiar [[kind]]; otherwise a
free will would be an absurdity. physical necessity is a heteronomy of
the efficient causes, for every effect is possible only according to
this [[law]], that something else determines the efficient cause to
exert its causality. what else then can [[freedom]] of the will be but
autonomy, that is, the [[property]] of the will to be a [[law]] to itself? but
the proposition: "the will is in every action a [[law]] to itself," only
expresses the [[principle]]: "to act on no other [[maxim]] than that which can
also have as an object itself as a universal [[law]]." now this is
precisely the formula of the categorical imperative and is the
principle of morality, so that a [[free]] will and a will [[subject]] to moral
laws are one and the same.

on the hypothesis, then, of [[freedom]] of the will, morality together
with its [[principle]] follows from it by mere analysis of the conception.
however, the latter is a synthetic proposition; viz., an absolutely
good will is that whose [[maxim]] can always include itself regarded as
a universal [[law]]; for this [[property]] of its [[maxim]] can never be
discovered by analysing the conception of an absolutely [[good]] will. now
such synthetic propositions are only possible in this way: that the
two cognitions are connected together by their union with a third in
which they are both to be found. the positive concept of freedom
furnishes this third cognition, which cannot, as with physical causes,
be the [[nature]] of the sensible [[world]] (in the concept of which we find
conjoined the concept of something in relation as cause to something
else as effect). we cannot now at once show what this third is to
which [[freedom]] points us and of which we have an [[idea]] a priori, nor can
we make intelligible how the concept of [[freedom]] is shown to be
legitimate from principles [[principle]] of pure practical [[reason]] and with it the
possibility of a categorical imperative; but some further
preparation is required.



   [[freedom]] must be presupposed as a [[property]] of the will

                 of all [[rational]] beings



it is not enough to predicate [[freedom]] of our own will, from whatever
reason, if we have not sufficient grounds for predicating the same
of all [[rational]] beings. for as morality serves as a [[law]] for us only
because we are [[rational]] beings, it must also hold for all rational
beings; and as it must be deduced simply from the [[property]] of [[freedom]],
it must be shown that [[freedom]] also is a [[property]] of all rational
beings. it is not enough, then, to prove it from [[certain]] supposed
experiences of [[human]] [[nature]] (which indeed is quite impossible, and
it can only be shown a priori), but we must show that it belongs to
the activity of all [[rational]] beings endowed with a will. now i say
every being that cannot act except under the [[idea]] of [[freedom]] is just
for that [[reason]] in a practical point of view really [[free]], that is to
say, all laws [[law]] which are inseparably connected with [[freedom]] have the
same [[force]] for him as if his will had been shown to be [[free]] in
itself by a proof theoretically conclusive. * now i affirm that we
must attribute to every [[rational]] being which has a will that it has
also the [[idea]] of [[freedom]] and acts entirely under this [[idea]]. for in
such a being we conceive a [[reason]] that is practical, that is, has
causality in reference to its objects. now we cannot possibly conceive
a [[reason]] consciously receiving a bias from any other quarter with
respect to its judgements, for then the [[subject]] would ascribe the
determination of its judgement not to its own [[reason]], but to an
impulse. it must regard itself as the author of its principles
independent of [[foreign]] influences. consequently as practical [[reason]] or
as the will of a [[rational]] being it must regard itself as [[free]], that is
to say, the will of such a being cannot be a will of its own except
under the [[idea]] of [[freedom]]. this [[idea]] must therefore in a practical
point of view be ascribed to every [[rational]] being.



* i adopt this method of assuming [[freedom]] merely as an [[idea]] which
rational beings suppose in their actions, in order to avoid the
necessity of proving it in its theoretical aspect also. the former
is sufficient for my [[purpose]]; for even though the speculative proof
should not be made out, yet a being that cannot act except with the
idea of [[freedom]] is bound by the same laws [[law]] that would oblige a being
who was actually [[free]]. thus we can escape here from the onus which
presses on the theory.



    of the interest attaching to the ideas [[idea]] of morality



we have finally reduced the definite conception of morality to the
idea of [[freedom]]. this latter, however, we could not prove to be
actually a [[property]] of ourselves or of [[human]] [[nature]]; only we saw
that it must be presupposed if we would conceive a being as rational
and conscious of its causality in [[respect]] of its actions, i.e., as
endowed with a will; and so we find that on just the same grounds we
must ascribe to every being endowed with [[reason]] and will this
attribute of determining itself to action under the [[idea]] of its
freedom.

now it resulted also from the presupposition of these ideas [[idea]] that
we became aware of a [[law]] that the subjective principles [[principle]] of action,
i.e., maxims [[maxim]], must always be so assumed that they can also hold as
objective, that is, universal principles [[principle]], and so serve as universal
laws of our own dictation. but why then should i [[subject]] myself to
this [[principle]] and that simply as a [[rational]] being, thus also
subjecting to it all other being endowed with [[reason]]? i will allow
that no interest urges me to this, for that would not give a
categorical imperative, but i must take an interest in it and
discern how this comes to pass; for this properly an "i ought" is
properly an "i would," valid for every [[rational]] being, provided only
that [[reason]] determined his actions without any hindrance. but for
beings that are in addition affected as we are by springs of a
different [[kind]], namely, sensibility, and in whose case that is not
always done which [[reason]] alone would do, for these that necessity is
expressed only as an "ought," and the subjective necessity is
different from the objective.

it seems then as if the [[moral]] [[law]], that is, the [[principle]] of
autonomy of the will, were properly speaking only presupposed in the
idea of [[freedom]], and as if we could not prove its reality and
objective necessity independently. in that case we should still have
gained something considerable by at least determining the true
principle more exactly than had previously been done; but as regards
its validity and the practical necessity of subjecting oneself to
it, we should not have advanced a step. for if we were [[asked]] why the
universal validity of our [[maxim]] as a [[law]] must be the condition
restricting our actions, and on what we ground the worth which we
assign to this manner of acting- a worth so [[great]] that there cannot be
any higher interest; and if we were [[asked]] further how it happens
that it is by this alone a [[man]] believes [[belief]] he feels [[feel]] his own personal
worth, in comparison with which that of an agreeable or disagreeable
condition is to be regarded as nothing, to these questions [[question]] we could
give no satisfactory [[answer]].

we find indeed sometimes that we can take an interest in a
personal quality which does not involve any interest of external
condition, provided this quality makes us capable of participating
in the condition in case [[reason]] were to effect the allotment; that
is to say, the mere being worthy of [[happiness]] can interest of itself
even without the motive of participating in this [[happiness]]. this
judgement, however, is in [[fact]] only the effect of the importance of
the [[moral]] [[law]] which we before presupposed (when by the [[idea]] of freedom
we detach ourselves from every empirical interest); but that we
ought to detach ourselves from these interests, i.e., to consider
ourselves as [[free]] in action and yet as [[subject]] to [[certain]] laws [[law]], so
as to find a worth simply in our own [[person]] which can compensate us
for the loss of everything that gives worth to our condition; this
we are not yet able to discern in this way, nor do we see how it is
possible so to act- in other words, whence the [[moral]] [[law]] derives its
obligation.

it must be freely admitted that there is a sort of circle here
from which it seems impossible to escape. in the order of efficient
causes we assume ourselves [[free]], in order that in the order of ends we
may conceive ourselves as [[subject]] to [[moral]] laws [[law]]: and we afterwards
conceive ourselves as [[subject]] to these laws [[law]], because we have
attributed to ourselves [[freedom]] of will: for [[freedom]] and
self-legislation of will are both autonomy and, therefore, are
reciprocal conceptions, and for this very [[reason]] one must not be
used to explain the other or give the [[reason]] of it, but at most only
logical purposes [[purpose]] to reduce apparently different notions of the same
object to one [[single]] concept (as we reduce different fractions of
the same value to the lowest terms).

one resource remains to us, namely, to inquire whether we do not
occupy different points of view when by means of [[freedom]] we think
ourselves as causes efficient a priori, and when we form our
conception of ourselves from our actions as effects which we see
before our [[eyes]].

it is a remark which needs no subtle reflection to make, but which
we may assume that even the commonest understanding can make, although
it be after its [[fashion]] by an obscure discernment of judgement which
it calls feeling, that all the "ideas" that come to us involuntarily
(as those of the senses) do not enable us to [[know]] objects otherwise
than as they affect us; so that what they may be in themselves remains
unknown to us, and consequently that as regards "ideas" of this kind
even with the closest attention and clearness that the understanding
can apply to them, we can by them only attain to the [[knowledge]] of
appearances, never to that of things in themselves. as soon as this
distinction has once been made (perhaps merely in consequence of the
difference observed between the ideas [[idea]] given us from without, and in
which we are passive, and those that we [[produce]] simply from ourselves,
and in which we show our own activity), then it follows of itself that
we must admit and assume behind the appearance something else that
is not an appearance, namely, the things in themselves; although we
must admit that as they can never be known to us except as they affect
us, we can come no nearer to them, nor can we ever [[know]] what they
are in themselves. this must furnish a distinction, however crude,
between a [[world]] of sense and the [[world]] of understanding, of which
the former may be different according to the difference of the
sensuous impressions in various observers, while the second which is
its basis always remains the same, even as to himself, a [[man]] cannot
pretend to [[know]] what he is in himself from the [[knowledge]] he has by
internal sensation. for as he does not as it were create himself,
and does not come by the conception of himself a priori but
empirically, it naturally follows that he can obtain his knowledge
even of himself only by the inner sense and, consequently, only
through the appearances of his [[nature]] and the way in which his
consciousness is affected. at the same [[time]] beyond these
characteristics of his own [[subject]], made up of mere appearances, he
must necessarily suppose something else as their basis, namely, his
ego, whatever its characteristics in itself may be. thus in [[respect]] to
mere perception and receptivity of sensations he must reckon himself
as belonging to the [[world]] of sense; but in [[respect]] of whatever there
may be of pure activity in him (that which reaches consciousness
immediately and not through affecting the senses), he must reckon
himself as belonging to the intellectual [[world]], of which, however,
he has no further [[knowledge]]. to such a conclusion the reflecting man
must come with [[respect]] to all the things which can be presented to
him: it is probably to be met with even in persons [[person]] of the commonest
understanding, who, as is well known, are very much inclined to
suppose behind the objects of the senses something else invisible
and acting of itself. they spoil it, however, by presently
sensualizing this invisible again; that is to say, wanting to make
it an object of intuition, so that they do not become a whit the
wiser.

now [[man]] really finds in himself a faculty by which he
distinguishes himself from everything else, even from himself as
affected by objects, and that is [[reason]]. this being pure spontaneity
is even elevated above the understanding. for although the latter is a
spontaneity and does not, like sense, merely contain intuitions that
arise when we are affected by things (and are therefore passive),
yet it cannot [[produce]] from its activity any other conceptions than
those which merely serve to bring the intuitions of sense under
rules and, thereby, to unite them in one [[consciousness]], and without
this use of the sensibility it could not [[think]] at all; whereas, on the
contrary, [[reason]] shows so pure a spontaneity in the case of what i
call ideas [[idea]] [ideal conceptions] that it thereby far transcends
everything that the sensibility can give it, and exhibits its most
important function in distinguishing the [[world]] of sense from that of
understanding, and thereby prescribing the limits of the understanding
itself.

for this [[reason]] a [[rational]] being must regard himself qua
intelligence (not from the side of his lower faculties) as belonging
not to the [[world]] of sense, but to that of understanding; hence he
has two points of view from which he can regard himself, and recognise
laws of the exercise of his faculties, and consequently of all his
actions: first, so far as he belongs to the [[world]] of sense, he finds
himself [[subject]] to laws [[law]] of [[nature]] (heteronomy); secondly, as belonging
to the intelligible [[world]], under laws [[law]] which being independent of
nature have their foundation not in [[experience]] but in [[reason]] alone.

as a [[rational]] being, and consequently belonging to the
intelligible [[world]], [[man]] can never conceive the causality of his own
will otherwise than on condition of the [[idea]] of [[freedom]], for
independence of the determinate causes of the sensible [[world]] (an
independence which [[reason]] must always ascribe to itself) is [[freedom]].
now the [[idea]] of [[freedom]] is inseparably connected with the conception
of autonomy, and this again with the universal [[principle]] of morality
which is ideally the foundation of all actions of [[rational]] beings,
just as the [[law]] of [[nature]] is of all phenomena.

now the suspicion is removed which we raised above, that there was a
latent circle involved in our reasoning from [[freedom]] to autonomy,
and from this to the [[moral]] [[law]], viz.: that we laid down the [[idea]] of
freedom because of the [[moral]] [[law]] only that we might afterwards in turn
infer the latter from [[freedom]], and that consequently we could assign
no [[reason]] at all for this [[law]], but could only [present] it as a
petitio principii which well disposed minds [[mind]] would gladly concede to
us, but which we could never put forward as a provable proposition.
for now we see that, when we conceive ourselves as [[free]], we transfer
ourselves into the [[world]] of understanding as members of it and
recognise the autonomy of the will with its consequence, morality;
whereas, if we conceive ourselves as under obligation, we consider
ourselves as belonging to the [[world]] of sense and at the same [[time]] to
the [[world]] of understanding.



         how is a categorical imperative possible?



every [[rational]] being reckons himself qua [[intelligence]] as belonging
to the [[world]] of understanding, and it is simply as an efficient
cause belonging to that [[world]] that he calls his causality a will. on
the other side he is also conscious of himself as a part of the
world of sense in which his actions, which are mere appearances
[phenomena] of that causality, are displayed; we cannot, however,
discern how they are possible from this causality which we do not
know; but instead of that, these actions as belonging to the
sensible [[world]] must be viewed as determined by other phenomena,
namely, desires [[desire]] and inclinations. if therefore i were only a member of
the [[world]] of understanding, then all my actions would perfectly
conform to the [[principle]] of autonomy of the pure will; if i were
only a part of the [[world]] of sense, they would necessarily be assumed
to conform wholly to the [[natural]] [[law]] of desires [[desire]] and inclinations, in
other words, to the heteronomy of [[nature]]. (the former would rest on
morality as the supreme [[principle]], the latter on [[happiness]].) since,
however, the [[world]] of understanding contains the foundation of the
world of sense, and consequently of its laws [[law]] also, and accordingly
gives the [[law]] to my will (which belongs wholly to the [[world]] of
understanding) directly, and must be conceived as doing so, it follows
that, although on the one side i must regard myself as a being
belonging to the [[world]] of sense, yet on the other side i must
recognize myself as [[subject]] as an [[intelligence]] to the [[law]] of the world
of understanding, i.e., to [[reason]], which contains this [[law]] in the idea
of [[freedom]], and therefore as [[subject]] to the autonomy of the will:
consequently i must regard the laws [[law]] of the [[world]] of understanding as
imperatives for me and the actions which conform to them as duties [[duty]].

and thus what makes categorical imperatives possible is this, that
the [[idea]] of [[freedom]] makes me a member of an intelligible [[world]], in
consequence of which, if i were nothing else, all my actions would
always conform to the autonomy of the will; but as i at the same
time intuite myself as a member of the [[world]] of sense, they ought so
to conform, and this categorical "ought" implies a synthetic a
priori proposition, inasmuch as besides my will as affected by
sensible desires [[desire]] there is added further the [[idea]] of the same will
but as belonging to the [[world]] of the understanding, pure and practical
of itself, which contains the supreme condition according to [[reason]] of
the former will; precisely as to the intuitions of sense there are
added concepts of the understanding which of themselves signify
nothing but regular form in general and in this way synthetic a priori
propositions become possible, on which all [[knowledge]] of physical
nature rests.

the practical use of [[common]] [[human]] [[reason]] confirms this reasoning.
there is no one, not even the most consummate villain, provided only
that he is otherwise accustomed to the use of [[reason]], who, when we set
before him examples [[example]] of honesty of [[purpose]], of steadfastness in
following [[good]] maxims [[maxim]], of sympathy and general benevolence (even
combined with [[great]] sacrifices [[sacrifice]] of advantages and comfort), does not
wish that he might also possess these qualities. only on account of
his inclinations and impulses he cannot attain this in himself, but at
the same [[time]] he wishes [[wish]] to be [[free]] from such inclinations which are
burdensome to himself. he proves by this that he transfers himself
in [[thought]] with a will [[free]] from the impulses of the sensibility
into an order of things wholly different from that of his desires [[desire]] in
the field of the sensibility; since he cannot expect to obtain by that
wish any gratification of his desires [[desire]], nor any position which would
satisfy any of his actual or supposable inclinations (for this would
destroy the pre-eminence of the very [[idea]] which wrests that wish
from him): he can only expect a greater intrinsic worth of his own
person. this [[better]] [[person]], however, he imagines himself to be when be
transfers himself to the point of view of a member of the [[world]] of the
understanding, to which he is involuntarily forced by the [[idea]] of
freedom, i.e., of independence on determining causes of the [[world]] of
sense; and from this point of view he is conscious of a [[good]] will,
which by his own [[confession]] constitutes the [[law]] for the [[bad]] will
that he possesses as a member of the [[world]] of sense- a [[law]] whose
authority he recognizes while transgressing it. what he morally
"ought" is then what he necessarily "would," as a member of the
world of the understanding, and is conceived by him as an "ought" only
inasmuch as he likewise considers himself as a member of the world
of sense.



     of the extreme limits of all practical [[philosophy]].



all [[men]] attribute to themselves [[freedom]] of will. hence come all
judgements upon actions as being such as ought to have been done,
although they have not been done. however, this [[freedom]] is not a
conception of [[experience]], nor can it be so, since it still remains,
even though [[experience]] shows the contrary of what on supposition of
freedom are conceived as its necessary consequences. on the other side
it is equally necessary that everything that takes place should be
fixedly determined according to laws [[law]] of [[nature]]. this necessity of
nature is likewise not an empirical conception, just for this
reason, that it involves the motion of necessity and consequently of a
priori cognition. but this conception of a [[system]] of [[nature]] is
confirmed by [[experience]]; and it must even be inevitably presupposed if
experience itself is to be possible, that is, a connected [[knowledge]] of
the objects of sense resting on general laws [[law]]. therefore [[freedom]] is
only an [[idea]] of [[reason]], and its objective reality in itself is
doubtful; while [[nature]] is a concept of the understanding which proves,
and must necessarily prove, its reality in examples [[example]] of [[experience]].

there arises from this a dialectic of [[reason]], since the freedom
attributed to the will appears to contradict the necessity of
nature, and placed between these two ways [[reason]] for speculative
purposes finds the road of physical necessity much more beaten and
more appropriate than that of [[freedom]]; yet for practical purposes
the narrow footpath of [[freedom]] is the only one on which it is possible
to make use of [[reason]] in our conduct; hence it is just as impossible
for the subtlest [[philosophy]] as for the commonest [[reason]] of [[men]] to
argue away [[freedom]]. [[philosophy]] must then assume that no real
contradiction will be found between [[freedom]] and physical necessity
of the same [[human]] actions, for it cannot give up the conception of
nature any more than that of [[freedom]].

nevertheless, even though we should never be able to comprehend
how [[freedom]] is possible, we must at least remove this apparent
contradiction in a convincing manner. for if the [[thought]] of freedom
contradicts either itself or [[nature]], which is equally necessary, it
must in competition with physical necessity be entirely given up.

it would, however, be impossible to escape this contradiction if the
thinking [[subject]], which seems to itself [[free]], conceived itself in
the same sense or in the very same relation when it calls itself
free as when in [[respect]] of the same action it assumes itself to be
subject to the [[law]] of [[nature]]. hence it is an indispensable problem
of speculative [[philosophy]] to show that its illusion respecting the
contradiction rests on this, that we [[think]] of [[man]] in a different sense
and relation when we call him [[free]] and when we regard him as subject
to the laws [[law]] of [[nature]] as being part and parcel of [[nature]]. it must
therefore show that not only can both these very well co-exist, but
that both must be [[thought]] as necessarily [[united]] in the same [[subject]],
since otherwise no [[reason]] could be given why we should burden reason
with an [[idea]] which, though it may possibly without contradiction be
reconciled with another that is sufficiently established, yet
entangles us in a perplexity which sorely embarrasses [[reason]] in its
theoretic employment. this [[duty]], however, belongs only to
speculative [[philosophy]]. the philosopher then has no option whether
he will remove the apparent contradiction or leave it untouched; for
in the latter case the theory respecting this would be bonum vacans,
into the possession of which the fatalist would have a [[right]] to
enter and chase all morality out of its supposed domain as occupying
it without title.

we cannot however as yet say that we are touching the bounds of
practical [[philosophy]]. for the settlement of that controversy does
not belong to it; it only demands from speculative [[reason]] that it
should put an end to the discord in which it entangles itself in
theoretical questions [[question]], so that practical [[reason]] may have rest and
security from external attacks which might make the ground debatable
on which it desires [[desire]] to build.

the claims to [[freedom]] of will made even by [[common]] [[reason]] are founded
on the [[consciousness]] and the admitted supposition that [[reason]] is
independent of merely subjectively determined causes which together
constitute what belongs to sensation only and which consequently
come under the general designation of sensibility. [[man]] considering
himself in this way as an [[intelligence]] places himself thereby in a
different order of things and in a relation to determining grounds
of a wholly different [[kind]] when on the one hand he thinks [[think]] of himself
as an [[intelligence]] endowed with a will, and consequently with
causality, and when on the other he perceives himself as a
phenomenon in the [[world]] of sense (as he really is also), and affirms
that his causality is [[subject]] to external determination according to
laws of [[nature]]. now he soon becomes aware that both can hold [[good]],
nay, must hold [[good]] at the same [[time]]. for there is not the smallest
contradiction in saying that a thing in appearance (belonging to the
world of sense) is [[subject]] to [[certain]] laws [[law]], of which the very same
as a thing or being in itself is independent, and that he must
conceive and [[think]] of himself in this twofold way, rests as to the
first on the [[consciousness]] of himself as an object affected through
the senses, and as to the second on the [[consciousness]] of himself as an
intelligence, i.e., as independent on sensible impressions in the
employment of his [[reason]] (in other words as belonging to the world
of understanding).

hence it comes to pass that [[man]] claims the possession of a will
which takes no account of anything that comes under the head of
desires and inclinations and, on the contrary, conceives actions as
possible to him, nay, even as necessary which can only be done by
disregarding all desires [[desire]] and sensible inclinations. the causality of
such actions lies [[lie]] in him as an [[intelligence]] and in the laws [[law]] of effects
and actions [which depend] on the principles [[principle]] of an intelligible [[world]],
of which indeed he knows [[know]] nothing more than that in it pure reason
alone independent of sensibility gives the [[law]]; moreover since it is
only in that [[world]], as an [[intelligence]], that he is his proper self
(being as [[man]] only the appearance of himself), those laws [[law]] apply to him
directly and categorically, so that the incitements of inclinations
and appetites (in other words the whole [[nature]] of the [[world]] of
sense) cannot impair the laws [[law]] of his volition as an [[intelligence]]. nay,
he does not even hold himself responsible for the former or ascribe
them to his proper [[self]], i.e., his will: he only ascribes to his
will any indulgence which he might yield them if he allowed them to
influence his maxims [[maxim]] to the prejudice of the [[rational]] laws [[law]] of the
will.

when practical [[reason]] thinks [[think]] itself into a [[world]] of understanding,
it does not thereby transcend its own limits, as it would if it
tried to enter it by intuition or sensation. the former is only a
negative [[thought]] in [[respect]] of the [[world]] of sense, which does not give
any laws [[law]] to [[reason]] in determining the will and is positive only in
this [[single]] point that this [[freedom]] as a negative characteristic is at
the same [[time]] conjoined with a (positive) faculty and even with a
causality of [[reason]], which we designate a will, namely a faculty of so
acting that the [[principle]] of the actions shall conform to the
essential [[character]] of a [[rational]] motive, i.e., the condition that the
maxim have universal validity as a [[law]]. but were it to borrow an
object of will, that is, a motive, from the [[world]] of understanding,
then it would overstep its bounds and pretend to be acquainted with
something of which it knows [[know]] nothing. the conception of a [[world]] of
the understanding is then only a point of view which [[reason]] finds
itself compelled to take outside the appearances in order to
conceive itself as practical, which would not be possible if the
influences of the sensibility had a determining [[power]] on [[man]], but
which is necessary unless he is to be denied the [[consciousness]] of
himself as an [[intelligence]] and, consequently, as a [[rational]] cause,
energizing by [[reason]], that is, operating freely. this thought
certainly involves the [[idea]] of an order and a [[system]] of laws [[law]] different
from that of the mechanism of [[nature]] which belongs to the sensible
world; and it makes the conception of an intelligible world
necessary (that is to say, the whole [[system]] of [[rational]] beings as
things in themselves). but it does not in the least authorize us to
think of it further than as to its formal condition only, that is, the
universality of the maxims [[maxim]] of the will as laws [[law]], and consequently the
autonomy of the latter, which alone is consistent with its [[freedom]];
whereas, on the contrary, all laws [[law]] that refer to a definite object
give heteronomy, which only belongs to laws [[law]] of [[nature]] and can only
apply to the sensible [[world]].

but [[reason]] would overstep all its bounds if it undertook to
explain how pure [[reason]] can be practical, which would be exactly the
same problem as to explain how [[freedom]] is possible.

for we can explain nothing but that which we can reduce to laws [[law]], the
object of which can be given in some possible [[experience]]. but
freedom is a mere [[idea]], the objective reality of which can in no
wise be shown according to laws [[law]] of [[nature]], and consequently not in any
possible [[experience]]; and for this [[reason]] it can never be
comprehended or understood, because we cannot support it by any sort
of [[example]] or analogy. it holds [[good]] only as a necessary hypothesis of
reason in a being that believes [[belief]] itself conscious of a will, that is,
of a faculty distinct from mere [[desire]] (namely, a faculty of
determining itself to action as an [[intelligence]], in other words, by
laws of [[reason]] independently on [[natural]] instincts). now where
determination according to laws [[law]] of [[nature]] ceases, there all
explanation ceases also, and nothing remains but defence, i.e., the
removal of the objections of those who pretend to have seen deeper
into the [[nature]] of things, and thereupon boldly declare freedom
impossible. we can only point out to them that the supposed
contradiction that they have discovered in it arises only from this,
that in order to be able to apply the [[law]] of [[nature]] to human
actions, they must necessarily consider [[man]] as an appearance: then
when we demand of them that they should also [[think]] of him qua
intelligence as a thing in itself, they still persist in considering
him in this [[respect]] also as an appearance. in this view it would no
doubt be a contradiction to suppose the causality of the same
subject (that is, his will) to be withdrawn from all the natural
laws of the sensible [[world]]. but this contradiction disappears, if they
would only bethink themselves and admit, as is reasonable, that behind
the appearances there must also [[lie]] at their root (although hidden)
the things in themselves, and that we cannot expect the laws [[law]] of
these to be the same as those that govern their appearances.

the subjective impossibility of explaining the [[freedom]] of the will
is identical with the impossibility of discovering and explaining an
interest * which [[man]] can take in the [[moral]] [[law]]. nevertheless he does
actually take an interest in it, the basis of which in us we call
the [[moral]] feeling, which some have falsely assigned as the standard of
our [[moral]] judgement, whereas it must rather be viewed as the
subjective effect that the [[law]] exercises on the will, the objective
principle of which is furnished by [[reason]] alone.



* interest is that by which [[reason]] becomes practical, i.e., a cause
determining the will. hence we say of [[rational]] beings only that they
take an interest in a thing; irrational beings only [[feel]] sensual
appetites. [[reason]] takes a direct interest in action then only when the
universal validity of its maxims [[maxim]] is alone sufficient to determine
the will. such an interest alone is pure. but if it can determine
the will only by means of another object of [[desire]] or on the
suggestion of a particular feeling of the [[subject]], then [[reason]] takes
only an indirect interest in the action, and, as [[reason]] by itself
without [[experience]] cannot discover either objects of the will or a
special feeling actuating it, this latter interest would only be
empirical and not a pure [[rational]] interest. the logical interest of
reason (namely, to extend its insight) is never direct, but
presupposes purposes [[purpose]] for which [[reason]] is employed.



in order indeed that a [[rational]] being who is also affected through
the senses should will what [[reason]] alone directs such beings that they
ought to will, it is no [[doubt]] requisite that [[reason]] should have a
power to infuse a feeling of [[pleasure]] or satisfaction in the
fulfilment of [[duty]], that is to say, that it should have a causality by
which it determines the sensibility according to its own principles [[principle]].
but it is quite impossible to discern, i.e., to make it intelligible a
priori, how a mere [[thought]], which itself contains nothing sensible,
can itself [[produce]] a sensation of [[pleasure]] or [[pain]]; for this is a
particular [[kind]] of causality of which as of every other causality we
can determine nothing whatever a priori; we must only consult
experience about it. but as this cannot supply us with any relation of
cause and effect except between two objects of [[experience]], whereas
in this case, although indeed the effect produced lies [[lie]] within
experience, yet the cause is supposed to be pure [[reason]] acting through
mere ideas [[idea]] which offer no object to [[experience]], it follows that for us
men it is quite impossible to explain how and why the universality
of the [[maxim]] as a [[law]], that is, morality, interests. this only is
certain, that it is not because it interests us that it has validity
for us (for that would be heteronomy and dependence of practical
reason on sensibility, namely, on a feeling as its [[principle]], in which
case it could never give [[moral]] laws), but that it interests us because
it is valid for us as [[men]], inasmuch as it had its source in our will
as intelligences, in other words, in our proper [[self]], and what belongs
to mere appearance is necessarily subordinated by [[reason]] to the nature
of the thing in itself.

the [[question]] then, "how a categorical imperative is possible," can
be answered to this extent, that we can assign the only hypothesis
on which it is possible, namely, the [[idea]] of [[freedom]]; and we can
also discern the necessity of this hypothesis, and this is
sufficient for the practical exercise of [[reason]], that is, for the
conviction of the validity of this imperative, and hence of the
moral [[law]]; but how this hypothesis itself is possible can never be
discerned by any [[human]] [[reason]]. on the hypothesis, however, that the
will of an [[intelligence]] is [[free]], its autonomy, as the essential formal
condition of its determination, is a necessary consequence.
moreover, this [[freedom]] of will is not merely quite possible as a
hypothesis (not involving any contradiction to the [[principle]] of
physical necessity in the connexion of the phenomena of the sensible
world) as speculative [[philosophy]] can show: but further, a rational
being who is conscious of causality through [[reason]], that is to say, of
a will (distinct from desires), must of necessity make it practically,
that is, in [[idea]], the condition of all his voluntary actions. but to
explain how pure [[reason]] can be of itself practical without the aid
of any spring of action that could be derived from any other source,
i.e., how the mere [[principle]] of the universal validity of all its
maxims as laws [[law]] (which would certainly be the form of a pure
practical reason) can of itself supply a spring, without any matter
(object) of the will in which one could antecedently take any
interest; and how it can [[produce]] an interest which would be called
purely [[moral]]; or in other words, how pure [[reason]] can be practical-
to explain this is beyond the [[power]] of [[human]] [[reason]], and all the
labour and pains [[pain]] of seeking an explanation of it are lost.

it is just the same as if i sought to find out how [[freedom]] itself is
possible as the causality of a will. for then i quit the ground of
philosophical explanation, and i have no other to go upon. i might
indeed revel in the [[world]] of intelligences which still remains to
me, but although i have an [[idea]] of it which is well founded, yet i
have not the least [[knowledge]] of it, nor an i ever attain to such
knowledge with all the efforts of my [[natural]] faculty of [[reason]]. it
signifies only a something that remains over when i have eliminated
everything belonging to the [[world]] of sense from the actuating
principles of my will, serving merely to keep in bounds the
principle of motives taken from the field of sensibility; fixing its
limits and showing that it does not contain all in all within
itself, but that there is more beyond it; but this something more i
know no further. of pure [[reason]] which frames this ideal, there remains
after the abstraction of all matter, i.e., [[knowledge]] of objects,
nothing but the form, namely, the practical [[law]] of the universality of
the maxims [[maxim]], and in conformity with this conception of [[reason]] in
reference to a pure [[world]] of understanding as a possible efficient
cause, that is a cause determining the will. there must here be a
total absence of springs; unless this [[idea]] of an intelligible [[world]] is
itself the spring, or that in which [[reason]] primarily takes an
interest; but to make this intelligible is precisely the problem
that we cannot solve.

here now is the extreme limit of all [[moral]] inquiry, and it is of
great importance to determine it even on this account, in order that
reason may not on the one hand, to the prejudice of morals [[moral]], seek about
in the [[world]] of sense for the supreme motive and an interest
comprehensible but empirical; and on the other hand, that it may not
impotently flap its wings without being able to move in the (for it)
empty space of transcendent concepts which we call the intelligible
world, and so lose itself amidst chimeras. for the rest, the [[idea]] of a
pure [[world]] of understanding as a [[system]] of all intelligences, and to
which we ourselves as [[rational]] beings belong (although we are likewise
on the other side members of the sensible world), this remains
always a useful and legitimate [[idea]] for the purposes [[purpose]] of rational
belief, although all [[knowledge]] stops at its threshold, useful, namely,
to [[produce]] in us a lively interest in the [[moral]] [[law]] by means of the
noble ideal of a universal [[kingdom]] of ends in themselves (rational
beings), to which we can belong as members then only when we carefully
conduct ourselves according to the maxims [[maxim]] of [[freedom]] as if they were
laws of [[nature]].



                   concluding remark



the speculative employment of [[reason]] with [[respect]] to [[nature]] leads to
the absolute necessity of some supreme cause of the [[world]]: the
practical employment of [[reason]] with a view to [[freedom]] leads also to
absolute necessity, but only of the laws [[law]] of the actions of a
rational being as such. now it is an essential [[principle]] of [[reason]],
however employed, to push its [[knowledge]] to a [[consciousness]] of its
necessity (without which it would not be [[rational]] knowledge). it is,
however, an equally essential restriction of the same [[reason]] that it
can neither discern the necessity of what is or what happens, nor of
what ought to happen, unless a condition is supposed on which it is or
happens or ought to happen. in this way, however, by the constant
inquiry for the condition, the satisfaction of [[reason]] is only
further and further postponed. hence it unceasingly seeks the
unconditionally necessary and finds itself forced to assume it,
although without any means of making it comprehensible to itself,
happy enough if only it can discover a conception which agrees with
this assumption. it is therefore no [[fault]] in our deduction of the
supreme [[principle]] of morality, but an objection that should be made to
human [[reason]] in general, that it cannot enable us to conceive the
absolute necessity of an unconditional practical [[law]] (such as the
categorical imperative must be). it cannot be blamed for refusing to
explain this necessity by a condition, that is to say, by means of
some interest assumed as a basis, since the [[law]] would then cease to be
a supreme [[law]] of [[reason]]. and thus while we do not comprehend the
practical unconditional necessity of the [[moral]] imperative, we yet
comprehend its incomprehensibility, and this is all that can be fairly
demanded of a [[philosophy]] which strives to carry its principles [[principle]] up to
the very limit of [[human]] [[reason]].


                             the end
