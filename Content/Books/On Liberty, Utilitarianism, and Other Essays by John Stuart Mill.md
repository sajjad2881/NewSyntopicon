introduction.


i.

john stuart mill was born on 20th may 1806. he was a delicate child, and
the extraordinary [[education]] designed by his [[father]] was not calculated to
develop and improve his physical powers [[power]]. "i never was a boy," he says;
"never played cricket." his exercise was taken in the form of walks with
his [[father]], during which the elder mill lectured his [[son]] and examined
him on his [[work]]. it is idle to speculate on the possible results of a
different treatment. mill remained delicate throughout his [[life]], but was
endowed with that intense mental energy which is so often combined with
physical weakness. his [[youth]] was sacrificed to an [[idea]]; he was designed
by his [[father]] to carry on his [[work]]; the individuality of the boy was
unimportant. a visit to the south of [[france]] at the [[age]] of fourteen, in
company with the [[family]] of general sir samuel bentham, was not without
its influence. it was a glimpse of another atmosphere, though the
studious habits of his [[home]] [[life]] were maintained. moreover, he derived
from it his interest in [[foreign]] [[politics]], which remained one of his
characteristics to the end of his [[life]]. in 1823 he was appointed junior
clerk in the examiners' office at the [[india]] house.

mill's first essays were written in the _traveller_ about a year before
he entered the [[india]] house. from that [[time]] forward his literary [[work]] was
uninterrupted save by attacks of illness. his industry was stupendous.
he wrote articles on an infinite variety of subjects [[subject]], [[political]],
metaphysical, philosophic, [[religious]], poetical. he discovered tennyson
for his [[generation]], he influenced the writing of carlyle's _french
revolution_ as well as its [[success]]. and all the while he was engaged in
studying and preparing for his more ambitious works [[work]], while he rose step
by step at the [[india]] office. his _essays on unsettled questions [[question]] in
political economy_ were written in 1831, although they did not appear
until thirteen years later. his _system of logic_, the design of which
was even then fashioning itself in his brain, took thirteen years to
complete, and was actually published before the _political economy_. in
1844 appeared the article on michelet, which its author anticipated
would cause some discussion, but which did not create the sensation he
expected. next year there were the "claims of labour" and "guizot," and
in 1847 his articles on irish affairs in the _morning chronicle_. these
years were very much influenced by his [[friendship]] and correspondence
with comte, a [[curious]] comradeship between [[men]] of such different
temperament. in 1848 mill published his _political economy_, to which he
had given his serious study since the completion of his _logic_. his
articles and reviews, though they involved a [[good]] deal of work--as, for
instance, the re-perusal of the _iliad_ and the _odyssey_ in the
original before reviewing grote's _greece_--were recreation to the
student. the year 1856 saw him head of the examiners' office in the
india house, and another two years brought the end of his official [[work]],
owing to the transfer of [[india]] to the [[crown]]. in the same year his wife
died. _liberty_ was published shortly after, as well as the _thoughts on
parliamentary reform_, and no year passed without mill making important
contributions on the [[political]], philosophical, and ethical questions [[question]] of
the day.

seven years after the [[death]] of his [[wife]], mill was invited to contest
westminster. his feeling on the conduct of elections made him refuse to
take any personal action in the matter, and he gave the frankest
expression to his [[political]] views, but nevertheless he was elected by a
large majority. he was not a conventional [[success]] in the house; as a
speaker he lacked magnetism. but his influence was widely [[felt]]. "for the
sake of the house of commons [[common]] at large," said mr. gladstone, "i rejoiced
in his advent and deplored his disappearance. he did us all [[good]]." after
only three years in [[parliament]], he was defeated at the next general
election by mr. w. h. smith. he retired to avignon, to the pleasant
little house where the happiest years of his [[life]] had been spent in the
companionship of his [[wife]], and continued his disinterested labours [[labour]]. he
completed his edition of his father's _analysis of the mind_, and also
produced, in addition to less important [[work]], _the subjection of women_,
in which he had the active co-operation of his step-daughter. a [[book]] on
socialism was under consideration, but, like an earlier study of
sociology, it never was written. he died in 1873, his [[last]] years being
spent peacefully in the pleasant [[society]] of his step-daughter, from
whose tender [[care]] and earnest intellectual sympathy he caught maybe a
far-off reflection of the [[light]] which had irradiated his [[spiritual]] [[life]].


ii.

the circumstances under which john stuart mill wrote his _liberty_ are
largely connected with the influence which mrs. taylor wielded over his
career. the dedication is well known. it contains the most extraordinary
panegyric on a woman that any philosopher has ever penned. "were i but
capable of interpreting to the [[world]] one-half the [[great]] thoughts [[thought]] and
noble feelings which are buried in her grave, i should be the medium of
a greater benefit to it than is ever likely to arise from anything that
i can write, unprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivalled
wisdom." it is easy for the ordinary worldly cynicism to curl a
sceptical lip over sentences like these. there may be exaggeration of
sentiment, the necessary and inevitable reaction of a [[man]] who was
trained according to the "dry light" of so unimpressionable a [[man]] as
james mill, the [[father]]; but the passage quoted is not the only one in
which john stuart mill proclaims his unhesitating [[belief]] in the
intellectual influence of his [[wife]]. the treatise on _liberty_ was
written especially under her [[authority]] and encouragement, but there are
many earlier references to the [[power]] which she exercised over his [[mind]].
mill was introduced to her as early as 1831, at a dinner-party at mr.
taylor's house, where were [[present]], amongst others, roebuck, w. j. fox,
and miss harriet martineau. the acquaintance rapidly ripened into
intimacy and the intimacy into [[friendship]], and mill was never weary of
expatiating on all the advantages of so singular a relationship. in some
of the presentation copies of his [[work]] on _political economy_, he wrote
the following dedication:--"to mrs. john taylor, who, of all persons
known to the author, is the most highly qualified either to originate or
to appreciate speculation on social advancement, this [[work]] is with the
highest [[respect]] and esteem dedicated." an article on the enfranchisement
of [[women]] was made the [[occasion]] for another encomium. we shall hardly be
wrong in attributing a much later [[book]], _the subjection of women_,
published in 1869, to the influence wielded by mrs. taylor. finally, the
pages of the _autobiography_ ring with the dithyrambic [[praise]] of his
"almost infallible counsellor."

the facts [[fact]] of this remarkable intimacy can easily be stated. the
deductions are more difficult. there is no [[question]] that mill's
infatuation was the cause of considerable trouble to his acquaintances
and [[friends]]. his [[father]] openly taxed him with being in [[love]] with another
man's [[wife]]. roebuck, mrs. grote, mrs. austin, miss harriet martineau
were amongst those who [[suffered]] because they made some allusion to a
forbidden [[subject]]. mrs. taylor lived with her [[daughter]] in a lodging in
the [[country]]; but in 1851 her husband died, and then mill made her his
wife. opinions [[opinion]] were widely divergent as to her merits [[merit]]; but every one
agreed that up to the [[time]] of her [[death]], in 1858, mill was wholly lost
to his [[friends]]. george mill, one of mill's younger brothers [[brother]], gave it as
his [[opinion]] that she was a clever and remarkable woman, but "nothing
like what john took her to be." carlyle, in his reminiscences, described
her with ambiguous epithets. she was "vivid," "iridescent," "pale and
passionate and sad-looking, a living-romance heroine of the royalist
volition and questionable [[destiny]]." it is not possible to make much of a
judgment like this, but we get on more [[certain]] ground when we discover
that mrs. carlyle said on one [[occasion]] that "she is [[thought]] to be
dangerous," and that carlyle added that she was worse than dangerous,
she was patronising. the [[occasion]] when mill and his [[wife]] were brought
into close contact with the carlyles is well known. the manuscript of
the first volume of the _french revolution_ had been lent to mill, and
was accidentally burnt by mrs. mill's servant. mill and his [[wife]] drove
up to carlyle's door, the [[wife]] speechless, the husband so full of
conversation that he detained carlyle with desperate attempts at
loquacity for two hours. but dr. garnett tells us, in his _life of
carlyle_, that mill made a substantial reparation for the calamity for
which he was responsible by inducing the aggrieved author to accept half
of the £200 which he offered. mrs. mill, as i have said, died in 1858,
after seven years of [[happy]] companionship with her husband, and was
buried at avignon. the inscription which mill wrote for her grave is too
characteristic to be omitted:--"her [[great]] and loving [[heart]], her noble
soul, her clear, powerful, original, and comprehensive [[intellect]], made
her the guide and support, the instructor in [[wisdom]] and the [[example]] in
goodness, as she was the sole earthly delight of those who had the
happiness to belong to her. as earnest for all [[public]] [[good]] as she was
generous and devoted to all who surrounded her, her influence has been
felt in many of the [[greatest]] improvements of the [[age]], and will be in
those still to come. were there even a few hearts [[heart]] and intellects like
hers, this [[earth]] would already become the hoped-for [[heaven]]." these lines
prove the intensity of mill's feeling, which is not afraid of abundant
verbiage; but they also prove that he could not imagine what the effect
would be on others, and, as grote said, only mill's [[reputation]] could
survive these and similar displays.

every one will [[judge]] for himself of this romantic episode in mill's
career, according to such [[experience]] as he may possess of the
philosophic [[mind]] and of the value of these [[curious]] but not infrequent
relationships. it may have been a piece of infatuation, or, if we prefer
to say so, it may have been the most gracious and the most [[human]] page in
mill's [[career]]. mrs. mill may have flattered her husband's vanity by
echoing his opinions [[opinion]], or she may have indeed been an egeria, full of
inspiration and intellectual helpfulness. what usually happens in these
cases,--although the philosopher himself, through his [[belief]] in the
equality of the sexes [[sex]], was debarred from thinking so,--is the extremely
valuable action and reaction of two different classes and orders of
mind. to any one whose thoughts [[thought]] have been occupied with the sphere of
abstract speculation, the lively and vivid presentment of concrete fact
comes as a delightful and agreeable shock. the instinct of the woman
often enables her not only to apprehend but to illustrate a [[truth]] for
which she would be totally unable to give the adequate philosophic
reasoning. on the other hand, the [[man]], with the more careful logical
methods and the slow processes of formal reasoning, is apt to suppose
that the [[happy]] intuition which leaps to the conclusion is really based
on the intellectual processes of which he is conscious in his own case.
thus both parties to the [[happy]] contract are equally pleased. the
abstract [[truth]] gets the concrete illustration; the concrete illustration
finds its proper foundation in a series of abstract inquiries. perhaps
carlyle's epithets of "iridescent" and "vivid" refer incidentally to
mrs. mill's quick perceptiveness, and thus throw a useful [[light]] on the
mutual advantages of the [[common]] [[work]] of husband and [[wife]]. but it savours
almost of impertinence even to attempt to lift the veil on a mystery
like this. it is enough to say, perhaps, that however much we may
deplore the exaggeration of mill's references to his [[wife]], we recognise
that, for whatever [[reason]], the pair lived an ideally [[happy]] [[life]].

it still, however, remains to estimate the extent to which mrs. taylor,
both before and after her [[marriage]] with mill, made actual contributions
to his thoughts [[thought]] and his [[public]] [[work]]. here i may be perhaps permitted to
avail myself of what i have already written in a previous [[work]].[1] mill
gives us abundant [[help]] in this matter in the _autobiography_. when first
he knew her, his thoughts [[thought]] were turning to the [[subject]] of [[logic]]. but his
published [[work]] on the [[subject]] owed nothing to her, he tells us, in its
doctrines. it was mill's custom to write the whole of a [[book]] so as to
get his general scheme complete, and then laboriously to re-write it in
order to [[perfect]] the phrases and the composition. doubtless mrs. taylor
was of considerable [[help]] to him as a critic of style. but to be a critic
of doctrine she was hardly qualified. mill has made some clear
admissions on this point. "the only actual [[revolution]] which has ever
taken place in my modes of thinking was already complete,"[2] he says,
before her influence became paramount. there is a curiously humble
estimate of his own powers [[power]] (to which dr. bain has called attention),
which reads at first sight as if it contradicted this. "during the
greater part of my literary [[life]] i have performed the office in relation
to her, which, from a rather early period, i had considered as the most
useful part that i was qualified to take in the domain of [[thought]], that
of an interpreter of original thinkers, and mediator between them and
the [[public]]." so far it would seem that mill had sat at the feet of his
oracle; but observe the highly remarkable exception which is made in the
following sentence:--"for i had always a humble [[opinion]] of my own powers
as an original thinker, _except in abstract [[science]] (logic, metaphysics,
and the theoretic principles [[principle]] of [[political]] economy and [[politics]].)_"[3] if
mill then was an original thinker in [[logic]], metaphysics, and the science
of economy and [[politics]], it is clear that he had not learnt these from
her lips. and to most [[men]] [[logic]] and metaphysics may be safely taken as
forming a domain in which originality of [[thought]], if it can be honestly
professed, is a sufficient title of distinction.

mrs. taylor's assistance in the _political economy_ is confined to
certain definite points. the purely scientific part was, we are assured,
not learnt from her. "but it was chiefly her influence which gave to the
book that general tone by which it is distinguished from all previous
expositions of [[political]] economy that had any pretensions to be
scientific, and which has made it so useful in conciliating minds [[mind]] which
those previous expositions had repelled. this tone consisted chiefly in
making the proper distinction between the laws [[law]] of the production of
wealth, which are real laws [[law]] of [[nature]], dependent on the properties [[property]] of
objects, and the modes of its distribution, which, [[subject]] to certain
conditions, depend on [[human]] will.... _i had indeed partially learnt this
view of things from the thoughts [[thought]] awakened in me by the speculations of
st. simonians_; but it was made a living [[principle]], pervading and
animating the [[book]], by my wife's promptings."[4] the part which is
italicised is noticeable. here, as elsewhere, mill thinks [[think]] out the matter
by himself; the concrete form of the thoughts [[thought]] is suggested or prompted
by the [[wife]]. apart from this "general tone," mill tells us that there
was a specific contribution. "the [[chapter]] which has had a greater
influence on [[opinion]] than all the rest, that on the probable future of
the labouring classes, is entirely due to her. in the first draft of the
book that [[chapter]] did not [[exist]]. she pointed out the need of such a
chapter, and the extreme imperfection of the [[book]] without it; she was
the cause of my writing it." from this it would appear that she gave
mill that tendency to socialism which, while it lends a progressive
spirit to his speculations on [[politics]], at the same [[time]] does not
manifestly accord with his earlier advocacy of peasant proprietorships.
nor, again, is it, on the face of it, consistent with those doctrines of
individual [[liberty]] which, aided by the intellectual companionship of his
wife, he propounded in a later [[work]]. the ideal of [[individual]] [[freedom]] is
not the ideal of socialism, just as that invocation of governmental aid
to which the socialist resorts is not consistent with the theory of
_laisser-faire_. yet _liberty_ was planned by mill and his [[wife]] in
concert. perhaps a slight visionariness of speculation was no less the
attribute of mrs. mill than an absence of rigid logical principles [[principle]]. be
this as it may, she undoubtedly checked the half-recognised leanings of
her husband in the direction of coleridge and carlyle. whether this was
an instance of her steadying influence,[5] or whether it added one more
unassimilated element to mill's diverse intellectual sustenance, may be
wisely left an open [[question]]. we cannot, however, be [[wrong]] in
attributing to her the parentage of one [[book]] of mill, _the subjection of
women_. it is true that mill had before learnt that [[men]] and [[women]] ought
to be [[equal]] in legal, [[political]], social, and domestic relations. this
was a point on which he had already fallen foul of his father's essay on
_government_. but mrs. taylor had actually written on this very point,
and the warmth and fervour of mill's denunciations of women's servitude
were unmistakably caught from his wife's view of the practical
disabilities entailed by the feminine position.


iii.

_liberty_ was published in 1859, when the nineteenth century was half
over, but in its general spirit and in some of its special tendencies
the little tract belongs rather to the standpoint of the eighteenth
century than to that which saw its birth. in many of his speculations
john stuart mill forms a sort of connecting link between the doctrines
of the earlier english empirical school and those which we associate
with the name of mr. herbert spencer. in his _logic_, for instance, he
represents an advance on the theories of hume, and yet does not see how
profoundly the victories [[victory]] of [[science]] modify the conclusions of the
earlier thinker. similarly, in his _political economy_, he desires [[desire]] to
improve and to enlarge upon ricardo, and yet does not advance so far as
the modifications of [[political]] economy by sociology, indicated by some
later--and especially german--speculations on the [[subject]]. in the tract
on _liberty_, mill is advocating the rights [[right]] of the [[individual]] as against
society at the very opening of an era that was rapidly coming to the
conclusion that the [[individual]] had no absolute rights [[right]] against [[society]].
the eighteenth century view is that individuals [[individual]] existed first, each with
their own special claims and responsibilities; that they deliberately
formed a social [[state]], either by a contract or otherwise; and that then
finally they limited their own action out of regard for the interests of
the social organism thus arbitrarily produced. this is hardly the view
of the nineteenth century. it is possible that logically the individual
is prior to the [[state]]; historically and in the order of [[nature]], the
state is prior to the [[individual]]. in other words, such rights [[right]] as every
single personality possesses in a [[modern]] [[world]] do not belong to him by
an original ordinance of [[nature]], but are slowly acquired in the growth
and [[development]] of the social [[state]]. it is not the [[truth]] that individual
liberties were forfeited by some deliberate act when [[men]] made themselves
into a commonwealth. it is more true to say, as [[aristotle]] said long ago,
that [[man]] is naturally a [[political]] animal, that he lived under strict
social laws [[law]] as a mere item, almost a nonentity, as compared with the
order, [[society]], or [[community]] to which he belonged, and that such
privileges as he subsequently acquired have been obtained in [[virtue]] of
his growing importance as a member of a growing organisation. but if
this is even approximately true, it seriously restricts that [[liberty]] of
the [[individual]] for which mill pleads. the [[individual]] has no [[chance]],
because he has no rights [[right]], against the social organism. [[society]] can
punish him for acts or even opinions [[opinion]] which are anti-social in [[character]].
his [[virtue]] lies [[lie]] in recognising the intimate communion with his fellows.
his sphere of activity is bounded by the [[common]] interest. just as it is
an absurd and exploded theory that all [[men]] are originally [[equal]], so it
is an ancient and false doctrine to [[protest]] that a [[man]] has an individual
liberty to [[live]] and [[think]] as he chooses in any spirit of antagonism to
that larger [[body]] of which he forms an insignificant part.

nowadays this view of [[society]] and of its [[development]], which we largely
owe to the _philosophie positive_ of m. auguste comte, is so familiar
and possibly so damaging to the [[individual]] initiative, that it becomes
necessary to advance and proclaim the [[truth]] which resides in an opposite
theory. all [[progress]], as we are aware, depends on the joint process of
integration and differentiation; synthesis, analysis, and then a larger
synthesis seem to form the [[law]] of [[development]]. if it ever comes to pass
that [[society]] is [[tyrannical]] in its restrictions of the [[individual]], if, as
for instance in some forms of socialism, based on deceptive analogies of
nature's dealings, the type is everything and the [[individual]] nothing, it
must be confidently urged in [[answer]] that the fuller [[life]] of the future
depends on the manifold activities, even though they may be
antagonistic, of the [[individual]]. in [[england]], at all events, we [[know]] that
government in all its different forms, whether as [[king]], or as a caste
of nobles [[noble]], or as an oligarchical plutocracy, or even as trades [[trade]] unions,
is so dwarfing in its action that, for the sake of the future, the
individual must revolt. just as our former point of view limited the
value of mill's treatise on _liberty_, so these considerations tend to
show its eternal importance. the omnipotence of [[society]] means a dead
level of uniformity. the claim of the [[individual]] to be heard, to say
what he likes, to do what he likes, to [[live]] as he likes, is absolutely
necessary, not only for the variety of elements without which [[life]] is
poor, but also for the [[hope]] of a future [[age]]. so long as individual
initiative and effort are recognised as a vital element in english
history, so long will mill's _liberty_, which he confesses was based on
a suggestion derived from von humboldt, remain as an indispensable
contribution to the speculations, and also to the health and sanity, of
the [[world]].


what his [[wife]] really was to mill, we shall, perhaps, never [[know]]. but
that she was an actual and vivid [[force]], which roused the latent
enthusiasm of his [[nature]], we have abundant evidence. and when she died
at avignon, though his [[friends]] may have regained an almost estranged
companionship, mill was, personally, the poorer. into the [[sorrow]] of that
bereavement we cannot enter: we have no [[right]] or [[power]] to draw the veil.
it is enough to quote the simple words, so eloquent of an unspoken
grief--"i can say nothing which could describe, even in the faintest
manner, what that loss was and is. but because i [[know]] that she would
have wished it, i endeavour to make the [[best]] of what [[life]] i have left,
and to [[work]] for her purposes [[purpose]] with such diminished [[strength]] as can be
derived from thoughts [[thought]] of her, and communion with her memory."

on [[liberty]].




chapter i.

introductory.


the [[subject]] of this essay is not the so-called [[liberty]] of the will, so
unfortunately opposed to the misnamed doctrine of philosophical
necessity; but civil, or social [[liberty]]: the [[nature]] and limits of the
power which can be legitimately exercised by [[society]] over the
individual. a [[question]] seldom stated, and hardly ever discussed, in
general terms, but which profoundly influences the practical
controversies of the [[age]] by its latent presence, and is likely soon to
make itself recognised as the vital [[question]] of the future. it is so far
from being new, that in a [[certain]] sense, it has divided [[mankind]], almost
from the remotest ages [[age]]; but in the stage of [[progress]] into which the more
civilised portions of the [[species]] have now entered, it presents [[present]] itself
under new conditions, and requires a different and more fundamental
treatment.

the struggle between [[liberty]] and [[authority]] is the most conspicuous
feature in the portions of [[history]] with which we are earliest familiar,
particularly in that of greece, [[rome]], and [[england]]. but in old times [[time]] this
contest was between subjects [[subject]], or some classes of subjects [[subject]], and the
government. by [[liberty]], was meant protection against the [[tyranny]] of the
political rulers. the rulers were conceived (except in some of the
popular governments [[government]] of greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position
to the [[people]] whom they ruled. they consisted of a governing one, or a
governing tribe or caste, who derived their [[authority]] from inheritance
or [[conquest]], who, at all events, did not hold it at the [[pleasure]] of the
governed, and whose [[supremacy]] [[men]] did not venture, perhaps did not
desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its
oppressive exercise. their [[power]] was regarded as necessary, but also as
highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against
their subjects [[subject]], no less than against external enemies [[enemy]]. to prevent the
weaker members of the [[community]] from being preyed upon by innumerable
vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey
stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down. but as the king
of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than any
of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude
of defence against his beak and claws. the aim, therefore, of patriots,
was to set limits to the [[power]] which the ruler should be [[suffered]] to
exercise over the [[community]]; and this limitation was what they meant by
liberty. it was attempted in two ways. first, by obtaining a recognition
of [[certain]] immunities, called [[political]] liberties [[liberty]] or rights [[right]], which it
was to be regarded as a breach of [[duty]] in the ruler to infringe, and
which if he did infringe, specific [[resistance]], or general rebellion, was
held to be justifiable. a second, and generally a later expedient, was
the establishment of constitutional checks; by which the [[consent]] of the
community, or of a [[body]] of some sort, supposed to represent its
interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important
acts of the governing [[power]]. to the first of these modes of limitation,
the ruling [[power]], in most [[european]] countries [[country]], was compelled, more or
less, to submit. it was not so with the second; and to attain this, or
when already in some [[degree]] possessed, to attain it more completely,
became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of [[liberty]]. and so
long as [[mankind]] were content to combat one [[enemy]] by another, and to be
ruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or less
efficaciously against his [[tyranny]], they did not carry their aspirations
beyond this point.

a [[time]], however, came, in the [[progress]] of [[human]] affairs, when [[men]] ceased
to [[think]] it a necessity of [[nature]] that their governors should be an
independent [[power]], opposed in interest to themselves. it appeared to
them much [[better]] that the various magistrates of the [[state]] should be
their tenants or delegates, revocable at their [[pleasure]]. in that way
alone, it seemed, could they have complete security that the powers [[power]] of
government would never be abused to their disadvantage. by degrees [[degree]], this
new demand for elective and temporary rulers became the prominent object
of the exertions of the popular party, wherever any such party existed;
and superseded, to a considerable extent, the previous efforts to limit
the [[power]] of rulers. as the struggle proceeded for making the ruling
power emanate from the periodical [[choice]] of the ruled, some persons
began to [[think]] that too much importance had been attached to the
limitation of the [[power]] itself. _that_ (it might seem) was a resource
against rulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of the
people. what was now wanted was, that the rulers should be identified
with the [[people]]; that their interest and will should be the interest and
will of the nation. the nation did not need to be protected against its
own will. there was no [[fear]] of its tyrannising over itself. let the
rulers be effectually responsible to it, promptly removable by it, and
it could afford to trust them with [[power]] of which it could itself
dictate the use to be made. their [[power]] was but the nation's own [[power]],
concentrated, and in a form convenient for exercise. this mode of
thought, or rather perhaps of feeling, was [[common]] among the last
generation of [[european]] liberalism, in the continental section of which
it still apparently predominates. those who admit any limit to what a
government may do, except in the case of such governments [[government]] as they think
ought not to [[exist]], stand out as brilliant exceptions among the
political thinkers of the continent. a similar tone of sentiment might
by this [[time]] have been prevalent in our own [[country]], if the
circumstances which for a [[time]] encouraged it, had continued unaltered.

but, in [[political]] and philosophical theories, as well as in persons [[person]],
success discloses faults [[fault]] and infirmities which failure might have
concealed from observation. the notion, that the [[people]] have no need to
limit their [[power]] over themselves, might seem axiomatic, when popular
government was a thing only dreamed about, or [[read]] of as having existed
at some distant period of the [[past]]. neither was that notion necessarily
disturbed by such temporary aberrations as those of the french
revolution, the worst of which were the [[work]] of a usurping few, and
which, in any case, belonged, not to the permanent working of popular
institutions, but to a sudden and convulsive outbreak against
monarchical and aristocratic despotism. in [[time]], however, a democratic
republic came to occupy a large portion of the earth's surface, and made
itself [[felt]] as one of the most powerful members of the [[community]] of
nations; and elective and responsible [[government]] became [[subject]] to the
observations and criticisms which wait upon a [[great]] existing [[fact]]. it
was now perceived that such phrases as "self-government," and "the power
of the [[people]] over themselves," do not express the true [[state]] of the
case. the "people" who exercise the [[power]] are not always the same people
with those over whom it is exercised; and the "self-government" spoken
of is not the [[government]] of each by himself, but of each by all the
rest. the will of the [[people]], moreover, practically means, the will of
the most numerous or the most active _part_ of the [[people]]; the majority,
or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority: the
people, consequently, _may_ [[desire]] to [[oppress]] a part of their number;
and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other
abuse of [[power]]. the limitation, therefore, of the [[power]] of government
over individuals [[individual]], loses none of its importance when the holders of power
are regularly accountable to the [[community]], that is, to the strongest
party therein. this view of things, recommending itself equally to the
intelligence of thinkers and to the inclination of those important
classes in [[european]] [[society]] to whose real or supposed interests
democracy is adverse, has had no difficulty in establishing itself; and
in [[political]] speculations "the [[tyranny]] of the majority" is now generally
included among the evils [[evil]] against which [[society]] requires to be on its
guard.

like other tyrannies, the [[tyranny]] of the majority was at first, and is
still vulgarly, held in dread, chiefly as operating through the acts of
the [[public]] authorities [[authority]]. but reflecting persons [[person]] perceived that when
society is itself the tyrant--society collectively, over the separate
individuals who compose it--its means of tyrannising are not restricted
to the acts which it may do by the hands of its [[political]] functionaries.
society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong
mandates instead of [[right]], or any mandates at all in things with which
it ought not to meddle, it practises a social [[tyranny]] more formidable
than many kinds [[kind]] of [[political]] oppression, since, though not usually
upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape,
penetrating much more deeply into the details of [[life]], and enslaving the
soul itself. protection, therefore, against the [[tyranny]] of the
magistrate is not enough: there needs protection also against the
tyranny of the prevailing [[opinion]] and feeling; against the tendency of
society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas
and practices as rules [[rule]] of conduct on those who dissent from them; to
fetter the [[development]], and, if possible, prevent the formation, of any
individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters [[character]] to
fashion themselves upon the model of its own. there is a limit to the
legitimate interference of collective [[opinion]] with individual
independence: and to find that limit, and maintain it against
encroachment, is as indispensable to a [[good]] condition of [[human]] affairs,
as protection against [[political]] despotism.

but though this proposition is not likely to be contested in general
terms, the practical [[question]], where to place the limit--how to make the
fitting adjustment between [[individual]] independence and social
control--is a [[subject]] on which nearly everything remains to be done. all
that makes existence valuable to any one, depends on the enforcement of
restraints upon the actions of other [[people]]. some rules [[rule]] of conduct,
therefore, must be imposed, by [[law]] in the first place, and by [[opinion]] on
many things which are not fit subjects [[subject]] for the operation of [[law]]. what
these rules [[rule]] should be, is the principal [[question]] in [[human]] affairs; but
if we except a few of the most obvious cases, it is one of those which
least [[progress]] has been made in resolving. no two ages [[age]], and scarcely any
two countries [[country]], have decided it alike; and the decision of one [[age]] or
country is a wonder to another. yet the [[people]] of any given [[age]] and
country no more suspect any difficulty in it, than if it were a subject
on which [[mankind]] had always been agreed. the rules [[rule]] which obtain among
themselves appear to them self-evident and self-justifying. this all but
universal illusion is one of the examples [[example]] of the magical influence of
custom, which is not only, as the proverb says, a second [[nature]], but is
continually mistaken for the first. the effect of custom, in preventing
any misgiving respecting the rules [[rule]] of conduct which [[mankind]] impose on
one another, is all the more complete because the [[subject]] is one on
which it is not generally considered necessary that reasons [[reason]] should be
given, either by one [[person]] to others, or by each to himself. [[people]] are
accustomed to [[believe]], and have been encouraged in the [[belief]] by some
who aspire to the [[character]] of [[philosophers]], that their feelings, on
subjects of this [[nature]], are [[better]] than reasons [[reason]], and render reasons
unnecessary. the practical [[principle]] which guides them to their opinions
on the regulation of [[human]] conduct, is the feeling in each person's mind
that everybody should be required to act as he, and those with whom he
sympathises, would like them to act. no one, indeed, acknowledges to
himself that his standard of [[judgment]] is his own liking; but an opinion
on a point of conduct, not supported by reasons [[reason]], can only count as one
person's preference; and if the reasons [[reason]], when given, are a mere appeal
to a similar preference [[felt]] by other [[people]], it is still only many
people's liking instead of one. to an ordinary [[man]], however, his own
preference, thus supported, is not only a perfectly satisfactory
reason, but the only one he generally has for any of his notions of
morality, taste, or propriety, which are not expressly written in his
religious creed; and his [[chief]] guide in the interpretation even of that.
men's opinions [[opinion]], accordingly, on what is laudable or blamable, are
affected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes [[wish]] in
regard to the conduct of others, and which are as numerous as those
which determine their wishes [[wish]] on any other [[subject]]. sometimes their
reason--at other times [[time]] their prejudices or superstitions: often their
social affections, not seldom their anti-social ones, their envy or
jealousy, their arrogance or contemptuousness: but most commonly, their
desires or fears [[fear]] for themselves--their legitimate or illegitimate
self-interest. wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion of
the morality of the [[country]] emanates from its class interests, and its
feelings of class superiority. the morality between spartans and helots,
between planters and negroes, between princes [[prince]] and subjects [[subject]], between
nobles and roturiers, between [[men]] and [[women]], has been for the most part
the creation of these class interests and feelings: and the sentiments
thus generated, react in turn upon the [[moral]] feelings of the members of
the ascendant class, in their relations among themselves. where, on the
other hand, a class, formerly ascendant, has lost its ascendancy, or
where its ascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing [[moral]] sentiments
frequently bear the impress of an impatient dislike of superiority.
another grand determining [[principle]] of the rules [[rule]] of conduct, both in act
and forbearance, which have been enforced by [[law]] or [[opinion]], has been
the servility of [[mankind]] towards the supposed preferences or aversions
of their temporal masters, or of their gods. this servility, though
essentially selfish, is not hypocrisy; it gives rise to perfectly
genuine sentiments of abhorrence; it made [[men]] burn magicians and
heretics. among so many baser influences, the general and obvious
interests of [[society]] have of course had a share, and a large one, in the
direction of the [[moral]] sentiments: less, however, as a matter of [[reason]],
and on their own account, than as a consequence of the sympathies and
antipathies which grew out of them: and sympathies and antipathies which
had little or nothing to do with the interests of [[society]], have made
themselves [[felt]] in the establishment of moralities with quite as great
force.

the likings and dislikings of [[society]], or of some powerful portion of
it, are thus the main thing which has practically determined the rules
laid down for general observance, under the penalties of [[law]] or
opinion. and in general, those who have been in advance of [[society]] in
thought and feeling have left this condition of things unassailed in
principle, however they may have come into conflict with it in some of
its details. they have occupied themselves rather in inquiring what
things [[society]] ought to like or dislike, than in questioning whether its
likings or dislikings should be a [[law]] to individuals [[individual]]. they preferred
endeavouring to alter the feelings of [[mankind]] on the particular points
on which they were themselves heretical, rather than make [[common]] cause
in defence of [[freedom]], with heretics generally. the only case in which
the higher ground has been taken on [[principle]] and maintained with
consistency, by any but an [[individual]] here and there, is that of
religious [[belief]]: a case instructive in many ways, and not least so as
forming a most striking instance of the fallibility of what is called
the [[moral]] sense: for the _odium theologicum_, in a sincere bigot, is one
of the most unequivocal cases of [[moral]] feeling. those who first broke
the yoke of what called itself the universal [[church]], were in general as
little willing to permit difference of [[religious]] [[opinion]] as that church
itself. but when the heat of the conflict was over, without giving a
complete [[victory]] to any party, and each [[church]] or sect was reduced to
limit its hopes [[hope]] to retaining possession of the ground it already
occupied; minorities, seeing that they had no [[chance]] of becoming
majorities, were under the necessity of pleading to those whom they
could not convert, for permission to differ. it is accordingly on this
battle-field, almost solely, that the rights [[right]] of the [[individual]] against
society have been asserted on broad grounds of [[principle]], and the claim
of [[society]] to exercise [[authority]] over dissentients, openly controverted.
the [[great]] writers to whom the [[world]] owes what [[religious]] [[liberty]] it
possesses, have mostly asserted [[freedom]] of [[conscience]] as an indefeasible
right, and denied absolutely that a [[human]] being is accountable to others
for his [[religious]] [[belief]]. yet so [[natural]] to [[mankind]] is intolerance in
whatever they really [[care]] about, that [[religious]] [[freedom]] has hardly
anywhere been practically realised, except where [[religious]] indifference,
which dislikes to have its [[peace]] disturbed by theological quarrels, has
added its weight to the scale. in the minds [[mind]] of almost all religious
persons, even in the most tolerant countries [[country]], the [[duty]] of toleration is
admitted with tacit reserves. one [[person]] will bear with dissent in
matters of [[church]] [[government]], but not of dogma; another can tolerate
everybody, short of a papist or a unitarian; another, every one who
believes in revealed [[religion]]; a few extend their charity a little
further, but stop at the [[belief]] in a [[god]] and in a future [[state]]. wherever
the sentiment of the majority is still [[genuine]] and intense, it is found
to have abated little of its claim to be obeyed.

in [[england]], from the peculiar circumstances of our [[political]] [[history]],
though the yoke of [[opinion]] is perhaps heavier, that of [[law]] is lighter,
than in most other countries [[country]] of [[europe]]; and there is considerable
jealousy of direct interference, by the legislative or the executive
power, with private conduct; not so much from any just regard for the
independence of the [[individual]], as from the still subsisting habit of
looking on the [[government]] as representing an opposite interest to the
public. the majority have not yet learnt to [[feel]] the [[power]] of the
government their [[power]], or its opinions [[opinion]] their opinions [[opinion]]. when they do so,
individual [[liberty]] will probably be as much exposed to [[invasion]] from the
government, as it already is from [[public]] [[opinion]]. but, as yet, there is
a considerable amount of feeling ready to be called forth against any
attempt of the [[law]] to control individuals [[individual]] in things in which they have
not hitherto been accustomed to be controlled by it; and this with very
little discrimination as to whether the matter is, or is not, within the
legitimate sphere of legal control; insomuch that the feeling, highly
salutary on the whole, is perhaps quite as often misplaced as well
grounded in the particular instances of its application. there is, in
fact, no recognised [[principle]] by which the propriety or impropriety of
government interference is customarily tested. [[people]] decide according
to their personal preferences. some, whenever they see any [[good]] to be
done, or [[evil]] to be remedied, would willingly instigate the government
to undertake the [[business]]; while others prefer to bear almost any amount
of social [[evil]], rather than add one to the departments of human
interests amenable to governmental control. and [[men]] range themselves on
one or the other side in any particular case, according to this general
direction of their sentiments; or according to the [[degree]] of interest
which they [[feel]] in the particular thing which it is proposed that the
government should do, or according to the [[belief]] they entertain that the
government would, or would not, do it in the manner they prefer; but
very rarely on account of any [[opinion]] to which they consistently adhere,
as to what things are fit to be done by a [[government]]. and it seems to me
that in consequence of this absence of [[rule]] or [[principle]], one side is
at [[present]] as often [[wrong]] as the other; the interference of government
is, with about [[equal]] frequency, improperly invoked and improperly
condemned.

the object of this essay is to assert one very simple [[principle]], as
entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of [[society]] with the
individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used
be physical [[force]] in the form of legal penalties, or the [[moral]] coercion
of [[public]] [[opinion]]. that [[principle]] is, that the sole end for which
mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with
the [[liberty]] of action of any of their number, is self-protection. that
the only [[purpose]] for which [[power]] can be rightfully exercised over any
member of a civilised [[community]], against his will, is to prevent harm to
others. his own [[good]], either physical or [[moral]], is not a sufficient
warrant. he cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it
will be [[better]] for him to do so, because it will make him happier,
because, in the opinions [[opinion]] of others, to do so would be [[wise]], or even
right. these are [[good]] reasons [[reason]] for remonstrating with him, or reasoning
with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling
him, or visiting him with any [[evil]] in case he do otherwise. to justify
that, the conduct from which it is [[desired]] to deter him must be
calculated to [[produce]] [[evil]] to some one else. the only part of the
conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to [[society]], is that which
concerns others. in the part which merely concerns himself, his
independence is, of [[right]], absolute. over himself, over his own [[body]] and
mind, the [[individual]] is [[sovereign]].

it is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to
apply only to [[human]] beings in the maturity of their faculties. we are
not speaking of [[children]], or of [[young]] persons [[person]] below the [[age]] which the
law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. those who are still in a
state to require being taken [[care]] of by others, must be protected
against their own actions as well as against external injury. for the
same [[reason]], we may leave out of consideration those backward states of
society in which the [[race]] itself may be considered as in its nonage. the
early difficulties in the way of spontaneous [[progress]] are so [[great]], that
there is seldom any [[choice]] of means for overcoming them; and a ruler
full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any
expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable.
despotism is a legitimate mode of [[government]] in dealing with
barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means
justified by actually effecting that end. [[liberty]], as a [[principle]], has
no application to any [[state]] of things anterior to the [[time]] when mankind
have become capable of being improved by [[free]] and [[equal]] discussion.
until then, there is nothing for them but implicit [[obedience]] to an akbar
or a charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one. but as soon
as [[mankind]] have attained the capacity of being guided to their own
improvement by conviction or persuasion (a period long since reached in
all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves), compulsion,
either in the direct form or in that of pains [[pain]] and penalties for
non-compliance, is no longer admissible as a means to their own [[good]],
and justifiable only for the security of others.

it is proper to [[state]] that i forego any advantage which could be derived
to my argument from the [[idea]] of abstract [[right]], as a thing independent
of utility. i regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical
questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on the
permanent interests of [[man]] as a progressive being. those interests, i
contend, authorise the subjection of [[individual]] spontaneity to external
control, only in [[respect]] to those actions of each, which concern the
interest of other [[people]]. if any one does an act hurtful to others,
there is a _primâ facie_ case for punishing him, by [[law]], or, where legal
penalties are not safely applicable, by general disapprobation. there
are also many positive acts for the benefit of others, which he may
rightfully be compelled to perform; such as, to give evidence in a court
of [[justice]]; to bear his [[fair]] share in the [[common]] defence, or in any
other joint [[work]] necessary to the interest of the [[society]] of which he
enjoys the protection; and to perform [[certain]] acts of individual
beneficence, such as saving a fellow-creature's [[life]], or interposing to
protect the defenceless against ill-usage, things which whenever it is
obviously a man's [[man]] [[duty]] to do, he may rightfully be made responsible to
society for not doing. a [[person]] may cause [[evil]] to others not only by his
actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is justly accountable
to them for the injury. the latter case, it is true, requires a much
more cautious exercise of compulsion than the former. to make any one
answerable for doing [[evil]] to others, is the [[rule]]; to make him answerable
for not preventing [[evil]], is, comparatively speaking, the exception. yet
there are many cases clear enough and grave enough to justify that
exception. in all things which regard the external relations of the
individual, he is _de jure_ amenable to those whose interests are
concerned, and if need be, to [[society]] as their protector. there are
often [[good]] reasons [[reason]] for not holding him to the responsibility; but these
reasons must arise from the special expediencies of the case: either
because it is a [[kind]] of case in which he is on the whole likely to act
better, when left to his own discretion, than when controlled in any way
in which [[society]] have it in their [[power]] to control him; or because the
attempt to exercise control would [[produce]] other evils [[evil]], greater than
those which it would prevent. when such reasons [[reason]] as these preclude the
enforcement of responsibility, the [[conscience]] of the agent himself
should step into the vacant [[judgment]] seat, and [[protect]] those interests
of others which have no external protection; judging himself all the
more rigidly, because the case does not admit of his being made
accountable to the [[judgment]] of his fellow-creatures.

but there is a sphere of action in which [[society]], as distinguished from
the [[individual]], has, if any, only an indirect interest; comprehending
all that portion of a person's [[life]] and conduct which affects only
himself, or if it also affects others, only with their [[free]], voluntary,
and undeceived [[consent]] and participation. when i say only himself, i
mean directly, and in the first instance: for whatever affects himself,
may affect others _through_ himself; and the objection which may be
grounded on this contingency, will receive consideration in the sequel.
this, then, is the appropriate region of [[human]] [[liberty]]. it comprises,
first, the inward domain of [[consciousness]]; demanding [[liberty]] of
conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; [[liberty]] of [[thought]] and
feeling; absolute [[freedom]] of [[opinion]] and sentiment on all subjects [[subject]],
practical or speculative, scientific, [[moral]], or theological. the liberty
of expressing and publishing opinions [[opinion]] may seem to fall under a different
principle, since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an individual
which concerns other [[people]]; but, being almost of as much importance as
the [[liberty]] of [[thought]] itself, and resting in [[great]] part on the same
reasons, is practically inseparable from it. secondly, the principle
requires [[liberty]] of tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our life
to suit our own [[character]]; of doing as we like, [[subject]] to such
consequences as may [[follow]]: without impediment from our
fellow-creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them, even though
they should [[think]] our conduct foolish, perverse, or [[wrong]]. thirdly, from
this [[liberty]] of each [[individual]], follows the [[liberty]], within the same
limits, of combination among individuals [[individual]]; [[freedom]] to unite, for any
purpose not involving harm to others: the persons [[person]] combining being
supposed to be of full [[age]], and not forced or deceived.

no [[society]] in which these liberties [[liberty]] are not, on the whole, respected, is
free, whatever may be its form of [[government]]; and none is completely
free in which they do not [[exist]] absolute and unqualified. the only
freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own [[good]] in our
own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or
impede their efforts to obtain it. each is the proper guardian of his
own health, whether bodily, or mental and [[spiritual]]. [[mankind]] are greater
gainers by suffering each other to [[live]] as seems [[good]] to themselves,
than by compelling each to [[live]] as seems [[good]] to the rest.

though this doctrine is anything but new, and, to some persons [[person]], may have
the air of a truism, there is no doctrine which stands more directly
opposed to the general tendency of existing [[opinion]] and practice.
society has expended fully as much effort in the attempt (according to
its lights) to compel [[people]] to conform to its notions of personal, as
of social excellence. the ancient commonwealths [[thought]] themselves
entitled to practise, and the ancient [[philosophers]] countenanced, the
regulation of every part of private conduct by [[public]] [[authority]], on the
ground that the [[state]] had a deep interest in the whole bodily and mental
discipline of every one of its [[citizens]]; a mode of thinking which may
have been admissible in small republics [[republic]] surrounded by powerful enemies [[enemy]],
in constant peril of being subverted by [[foreign]] attack or internal
commotion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and
self-command might so easily be fatal, that they could not afford to
wait for the salutary permanent effects of [[freedom]]. in the [[modern]] [[world]],
the greater size of [[political]] communities [[community]], and above all, the separation
between [[spiritual]] and temporal [[authority]] (which placed the direction of
men's consciences in other hands than those which controlled their
worldly affairs), prevented so [[great]] an interference by [[law]] in the
details of private [[life]]; but the engines of [[moral]] repression have been
wielded more strenuously against divergence from the reigning [[opinion]] in
self-regarding, than even in social matters; [[religion]], the most powerful
of the elements which have entered into the formation of [[moral]] feeling,
having almost always been governed either by the [[ambition]] of a
hierarchy, seeking control over every department of [[human]] conduct, or by
the spirit of puritanism. and some of those [[modern]] reformers who have
placed themselves in strongest opposition to the religions [[religion]] of the [[past]],
have been noway behind either churches [[church]] or sects in their assertion of
the [[right]] of [[spiritual]] domination: m. comte, in particular, whose social
system, as unfolded in his _traité de politique positive_, aims at
establishing (though by [[moral]] more than by legal appliances) a despotism
of [[society]] over the [[individual]], surpassing anything contemplated in the
political ideal of the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancient
philosophers.

apart from the peculiar tenets of [[individual]] thinkers, there is also in
the [[world]] at large an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the
powers of [[society]] over the [[individual]], both by the [[force]] of [[opinion]] and
even by that of legislation: and as the tendency of all the changes
taking place in the [[world]] is to strengthen [[society]], and diminish the
power of the [[individual]], this encroachment is not one of the evils [[evil]] which
tend spontaneously to disappear, but, on the contrary, to grow more and
more formidable. the disposition of [[mankind]], whether as rulers or as
fellow-citizens to impose their own opinions [[opinion]] and inclinations as a rule
of conduct on others, is so energetically supported by some of the best
and by some of the worst feelings incident to [[human]] [[nature]], that it is
hardly ever kept under restraint by anything but want of [[power]]; and as
the [[power]] is not declining, but growing, unless a [[strong]] barrier of
moral conviction can be raised against the mischief, we must expect, in
the [[present]] circumstances of the [[world]], to see it increase.

it will be convenient for the argument, if, instead of at once entering
upon the general thesis, we confine ourselves in the first instance to a
single branch of it, on which the [[principle]] here stated is, if not
fully, yet to a [[certain]] point, recognised by the current opinions [[opinion]]. this
one branch is the [[liberty]] of [[thought]]: from which it is impossible to
separate the cognate [[liberty]] of speaking and of writing. although these
liberties, to some considerable amount, form part of the political
morality of all countries [[country]] which profess [[religious]] toleration and free
institutions, the grounds, both philosophical and practical, on which
they rest, are perhaps not so familiar to the general [[mind]], nor so
thoroughly appreciated by many even of the leaders of [[opinion]], as might
have been expected. those grounds, when rightly understood, are of much
wider application than to only one division of the [[subject]], and a
thorough consideration of this part of the [[question]] will be found the
best introduction to the remainder. those to whom nothing which i am
about to say will be new, may therefore, i [[hope]], excuse me, if on a
subject which for now three centuries has been so often discussed, i
venture on one discussion more.




chapter ii.

of the [[liberty]] of [[thought]] and discussion.


the [[time]], it is to be hoped, is gone by, when any defence would be
necessary of the "liberty of the press" as one of the securities against
corrupt or [[tyrannical]] [[government]]. no argument, we may suppose, can now
be needed, against permitting a legislature or an executive, not
identified in interest with the [[people]], to prescribe opinions [[opinion]] to them,
and determine what doctrines or what arguments they shall be allowed to
hear. this aspect of the [[question]], besides, has been so often and so
triumphantly enforced by preceding writers, that it need not be
specially insisted on in this place. though the [[law]] of [[england]], on the
subject of the press, is as servile to this day as it was in the [[time]] of
the tudors, there is little danger of its being actually put in force
against [[political]] discussion, except during some temporary panic, when
fear of insurrection drives ministers and judges [[judge]] from their
propriety;[6] and, speaking generally, it is not, in constitutional
countries, to be apprehended that the [[government]], whether completely
responsible to the [[people]] or not, will often attempt to control the
expression of [[opinion]], except when in doing so it makes itself the organ
of the general intolerance of the [[public]]. let us suppose, therefore,
that the [[government]] is entirely at one with the [[people]], and never thinks
of exerting any [[power]] of coercion unless in agreement with what it
conceives to be their voice. but i deny the [[right]] of the [[people]] to
exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their [[government]]. the
power itself is illegitimate. the [[best]] [[government]] has no more title to
it than the worst. it is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in
accordance with [[public]] [[opinion]], than when in or opposition to it. if all
mankind minus one, were of one [[opinion]], and only one [[person]] were of the
contrary [[opinion]], [[mankind]] would be no more justified in silencing that
one [[person]], than he, if he had the [[power]], would be justified in
silencing [[mankind]]. were an [[opinion]] a personal possession of no value
except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were
simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the
injury was inflicted only on a few persons [[person]] or on many. but the peculiar
evil of silencing the expression of an [[opinion]] is, that it is robbing
the [[human]] [[race]]; [[posterity]] as well as the existing [[generation]]; those who
dissent from the [[opinion]], still more than those who hold it. if the
opinion is [[right]], they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging
error for [[truth]]: if [[wrong]], they lose, what is almost as [[great]] a benefit,
the clearer perception and livelier impression of [[truth]], produced by its
collision with error.

it is necessary to consider separately these two hypotheses, each of
which has a distinct branch of the argument corresponding to it. we can
never be sure that the [[opinion]] we are endeavouring to stifle is a false
opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an [[evil]] still.


first: the [[opinion]] which it is attempted to suppress by [[authority]] may
possibly be true. those who [[desire]] to suppress it, of course deny its
truth; but they are not infallible. they have no [[authority]] to decide the
question for all [[mankind]], and exclude every other [[person]] from the means
of judging. to refuse a hearing to an [[opinion]], because they are sure
that it is false, is to assume that _their_ certainty is the same thing
as _absolute_ certainty. all silencing of discussion is an assumption
of infallibility. its condemnation may be allowed to rest on this common
argument, not the worse for being [[common]].

unfortunately for the [[good]] sense of [[mankind]], the [[fact]] of their
fallibility is far from carrying the weight in their practical [[judgment]],
which is always allowed to it in theory; for while every one well knows
himself to be fallible, few [[think]] it necessary to take any precautions
against their own fallibility, or admit the supposition that any
opinion, of which they [[feel]] very [[certain]], may be one of the examples [[example]] of
the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable. absolute
princes, or others who are accustomed to unlimited deference, usually
feel this complete confidence in their own opinions [[opinion]] on nearly all
subjects. [[people]] more happily situated, who sometimes hear their
opinions disputed, and are not wholly unused to be set [[right]] when they
are [[wrong]], place the same unbounded reliance only on such of their
opinions as are shared by all who surround them, or to whom they
habitually defer: for in proportion to a man's [[man]] want of confidence in his
own solitary [[judgment]], does he usually repose, with implicit trust, on
the infallibility of "the world" in general. and the [[world]], to each
individual, means the part of it with which he comes in contact; his
party, his sect, his [[church]], his class of [[society]]: the [[man]] may be
called, by comparison, almost liberal and large-minded to whom it means
anything so comprehensive as his own [[country]] or his own [[age]]. nor is his
faith in this collective [[authority]] at all shaken by his being aware that
other ages [[age]], countries [[country]], sects, churches [[church]], classes, and parties have
thought, and even now [[think]], the exact reverse. he devolves upon his own
world the responsibility of being in the [[right]] against the dissentient
worlds of other [[people]]; and it never troubles him that mere accident has
decided which of these numerous worlds [[world]] is the object of his reliance,
and that the same causes which make him a churchman in [[london]], would
have made him a buddhist or a confucian in pekin. yet it is as evident
in itself as any amount of argument can make it, that ages [[age]] are no more
infallible than individuals [[individual]]; every [[age]] having held many opinions [[opinion]] which
subsequent ages [[age]] have deemed not only false but absurd; and it is as
certain that many opinions [[opinion]], now general, will be rejected by future
ages, as it is that many, once general, are rejected by the [[present]].

the objection likely to be made to this argument, would probably take
some such form as the following. there is no greater assumption of
infallibility in forbidding the propagation of error, than in any other
thing which is done by [[public]] [[authority]] on its own [[judgment]] and
responsibility. [[judgment]] is given to [[men]] that they may use it. because
it may be used erroneously, are [[men]] to be told that they ought not to
use it at all? to prohibit what they [[think]] pernicious, is not claiming
exemption from error, but fulfilling the [[duty]] incumbent on them,
although fallible, of acting on their conscientious conviction. if we
were never to act on our opinions [[opinion]], because those opinions [[opinion]] may be [[wrong]],
we should leave all our interests uncared for, and all our duties
unperformed. an objection which applies to all conduct, can be no valid
objection to any conduct in particular. it is the [[duty]] of governments [[government]],
and of individuals [[individual]], to form the truest opinions [[opinion]] they can; to form them
carefully, and never impose them upon others unless they are quite sure
of being [[right]]. but when they are sure (such reasoners may say), it is
not conscientiousness but cowardice to shrink from acting on their
opinions, and allow doctrines which they honestly [[think]] dangerous to the
welfare of [[mankind]], either in this [[life]] or in another, to be scattered
abroad without restraint, because other [[people]], in less enlightened
times, have persecuted opinions [[opinion]] now believed to be true. let us take
care, it may be said, not to make the same mistake: but governments [[government]] and
nations have made mistakes in other things, which are not denied to be
fit subjects [[subject]] for the exercise of [[authority]]: they have laid on [[bad]] taxes,
made [[unjust]] wars [[war]]. ought we therefore to lay on no taxes, and, under
whatever provocation, make no wars [[war]]? [[men]], and governments [[government]], must act to
the [[best]] of their ability. there is no such thing as absolute certainty,
but there is assurance sufficient for the purposes [[purpose]] of [[human]] [[life]]. we
may, and must, assume our [[opinion]] to be true for the guidance of our own
conduct: and it is assuming no more when we forbid [[bad]] [[men]] to pervert
society by the propagation of opinions [[opinion]] which we regard as false and
pernicious.

i [[answer]] that it is assuming very much more. there is the greatest
difference between presuming an [[opinion]] to be true, because, with every
opportunity for contesting it, it has not been refuted, and assuming its
truth for the [[purpose]] of not permitting its refutation. complete liberty
of contradicting and disproving our [[opinion]], is the very condition which
justifies us in assuming its [[truth]] for purposes [[purpose]] of action; and on no
other terms can a being with [[human]] faculties have any [[rational]] assurance
of being [[right]].

when we consider either the [[history]] of [[opinion]], or the ordinary conduct
of [[human]] [[life]], to what is it to be ascribed that the one and the other
are no worse than they are? not certainly to the inherent [[force]] of the
human understanding; for, on any matter not self-evident, there are
ninety-nine persons [[person]] totally incapable of judging of it, for one who is
capable; and the capacity of the hundredth [[person]] is only comparative;
for the majority of the eminent [[men]] of every [[past]] [[generation]] held many
opinions now known to be erroneous, and did or approved numerous things
which no one will now justify. why is it, then, that there is on the
whole a preponderance among [[mankind]] of [[rational]] opinions [[opinion]] and rational
conduct? if there really is this preponderance--which there must be,
unless [[human]] affairs are, and have always been, in an almost desperate
state--it is owing to a quality of the [[human]] [[mind]], the source of
everything respectable in [[man]] either as an intellectual or as a moral
being, namely, that his errors are corrigible. he is capable of
rectifying his mistakes, by discussion and [[experience]]. not by experience
alone. there must be discussion, to show how [[experience]] is to be
interpreted. [[wrong]] opinions [[opinion]] and practices gradually yield to [[fact]] and
argument: but facts [[fact]] and arguments, to [[produce]] any effect on the [[mind]],
must be brought before it. very few facts [[fact]] are able to tell their own
story, without comments to bring out their meaning. the whole strength
and value, then, of [[human]] [[judgment]], depending on the one [[property]], that
it can be set [[right]] when it is [[wrong]], reliance can be placed on it only
when the means of setting it [[right]] are kept constantly at hand. in the
case of any [[person]] whose [[judgment]] is really deserving of confidence, how
has it become so? because he has kept his [[mind]] open to criticism of his
opinions and conduct. because it has been his practice to listen to all
that could be said against him; to [[profit]] by as much of it as was just,
and expound to himself, and upon [[occasion]] to others, the fallacy of what
was fallacious. because he has [[felt]], that the only way in which a human
being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a [[subject]], is by
hearing what can be said about it by persons [[person]] of every variety of
opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every
character of [[mind]]. no [[wise]] [[man]] ever acquired his [[wisdom]] in any mode but
this; nor is it in the [[nature]] of [[human]] [[intellect]] to become [[wise]] in any
other manner. the steady habit of correcting and completing his own
opinion by collating it with those of others, so far from causing doubt
and hesitation in carrying it into practice, is the only stable
foundation for a just reliance on it: for, being cognisant of all that
can, at least obviously, be said against him, and having taken up his
position against all gainsayers--knowing that he has sought for
objections and difficulties, instead of avoiding them, and has shut out
no [[light]] which can be thrown upon the [[subject]] from any quarter--he has a
right to [[think]] his [[judgment]] [[better]] than that of any [[person]], or any
multitude, who have not gone through a similar process.

it is not too much to require that what the wisest of [[mankind]], those who
are [[best]] entitled to trust their own [[judgment]], find necessary to warrant
their relying on it, should be submitted to by that miscellaneous
collection of a few [[wise]] and many foolish individuals [[individual]], called the
public. the most intolerant of churches [[church]], the roman catholic [[church]], even
at the canonisation of a saint, admits, and listens patiently to, a
"devil's advocate." the holiest of [[men]], it appears, cannot be admitted
to posthumous honours [[honour]], until all that the [[devil]] could say against him is
known and weighed. if even the newtonian [[philosophy]] were not permitted
to be questioned, [[mankind]] could not [[feel]] as complete assurance of its
truth as they now do. the beliefs which we have most warrant for, have
no safeguard to rest on, but a standing invitation to the whole [[world]] to
prove them unfounded. if the challenge is not accepted, or is accepted
and the attempt fails, we are far enough from certainty still; but we
have done the [[best]] that the existing [[state]] of [[human]] [[reason]] admits of; we
have neglected nothing that could give the [[truth]] a [[chance]] of reaching
us: if the lists are kept open, we may [[hope]] that if there be a better
truth, it will be found when the [[human]] [[mind]] is capable of receiving it;
and in the meantime we may rely on having attained such approach to
truth, as is possible in our own day. this is the amount of certainty
attainable by a fallible being, and this the sole way of attaining it.

strange it is, that [[men]] should admit the validity of the arguments for
free discussion, but object to their being "pushed to an extreme;" not
seeing that unless the reasons [[reason]] are [[good]] for an extreme case, they are
not [[good]] for any case. [[strange]] that they should imagine that they are
not assuming infallibility, when they acknowledge that there should be
free discussion on all subjects [[subject]] which can possibly be _doubtful_, but
think that some particular [[principle]] or doctrine should be forbidden to
be questioned because it is _so certain_, that is, because _they are
certain_ that it is [[certain]]. to call any proposition [[certain]], while
there is any one who would deny its certainty if permitted, but who is
not permitted, is to assume that we ourselves, and those who agree with
us, are the judges [[judge]] of certainty, and judges [[judge]] without hearing the other
side.

in the [[present]] age--which has been described as "destitute of [[faith]], but
terrified at scepticism"--in which [[people]] [[feel]] sure, not so much that
their opinions [[opinion]] are true, as that they should not [[know]] what to do without
them--the claims of an [[opinion]] to be protected from [[public]] attack are
rested not so much on its [[truth]], as on its importance to [[society]]. there
are, it is alleged, [[certain]] beliefs, so useful, not to say indispensable
to well-being, that it is as much the [[duty]] of governments [[government]] to uphold
those beliefs, as to [[protect]] any other of the interests of [[society]]. in a
case of such necessity, and so directly in the line of their [[duty]],
something less than infallibility may, it is maintained, warrant, and
even bind, governments [[government]], to act on their own [[opinion]], confirmed by the
general [[opinion]] of [[mankind]]. it is also often argued, and still oftener
thought, that none but [[bad]] [[men]] would [[desire]] to weaken these salutary
beliefs; and there can be nothing [[wrong]], it is [[thought]], in restraining
bad [[men]], and prohibiting what only such [[men]] would [[wish]] to practise.
this mode of thinking makes the justification of restraints on
discussion not a [[question]] of the [[truth]] of doctrines, but of their
usefulness; and flatters itself by that means to escape the
responsibility of claiming to be an infallible [[judge]] of opinions [[opinion]]. but
those who thus satisfy themselves, do not perceive that the assumption
of infallibility is merely shifted from one point to another. the
usefulness of an [[opinion]] is itself matter of [[opinion]]: as disputable, as
open to discussion, and requiring discussion as much, as the opinion
itself. there is the same need of an infallible [[judge]] of opinions [[opinion]] to
decide an [[opinion]] to be noxious, as to decide it to be false, unless the
opinion condemned has full opportunity of defending itself. and it will
not do to say that the heretic may be allowed to maintain the utility or
harmlessness of his [[opinion]], though forbidden to maintain its [[truth]]. the
truth of an [[opinion]] is part of its utility. if we would [[know]] whether or
not it is desirable that a proposition should be believed, is it
possible to exclude the consideration of whether or not it is true? in
the [[opinion]], not of [[bad]] [[men]], but of the [[best]] [[men]], no [[belief]] which is
contrary to [[truth]] can be really useful: and can you prevent such men
from urging that plea, when they are charged with culpability for
denying some doctrine which they are told is useful, but which they
believe to be false? those who are on the side of received opinions [[opinion]],
never fail to take all possible advantage of this plea; you do not find
_them_ handling the [[question]] of utility as if it could be completely
abstracted from that of [[truth]]: on the contrary, it is, above all,
because their doctrine is "the [[truth]]," that the [[knowledge]] or the belief
of it is held to be so indispensable. there can be no [[fair]] discussion of
the [[question]] of usefulness, when an argument so vital may be employed on
one side, but not on the other. and in point of [[fact]], when [[law]] or public
feeling do not permit the [[truth]] of an [[opinion]] to be disputed, they are
just as little tolerant of a denial of its usefulness. the utmost they
allow is an extenuation of its absolute necessity, or of the positive
guilt of rejecting it.

in order more fully to illustrate the mischief of denying a hearing to
opinions because we, in our own [[judgment]], have condemned them, it will
be desirable to fix down the discussion to a concrete case; and i
choose, by preference, the cases which are least favourable to me--in
which the argument against [[freedom]] of [[opinion]], both on the score of
truth and on that of utility, is considered the strongest. let the
opinions impugned be the [[belief]] in a [[god]] and in a future [[state]], or any
of the commonly received doctrines of morality. to [[fight]] the [[battle]] on
such ground, gives a [[great]] advantage to an unfair antagonist; since he
will be sure to say (and many who have no [[desire]] to be unfair will say
it internally), are these the doctrines which you do not deem
sufficiently [[certain]] to be taken under the protection of [[law]]? is the
belief in a [[god]] one of the opinions [[opinion]], to [[feel]] sure of which, you hold to
be assuming infallibility? but i must be permitted to observe, that it
is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which i call
an assumption of infallibility. it is the undertaking to decide that
question _for others_, without allowing them to hear what can be said on
the contrary side. and i denounce and reprobate this pretension not the
less, if put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. however
positive any one's persuasion may be, not only of the falsity, but of
the pernicious consequences--not only of the pernicious consequences,
but (to adopt expressions which i altogether condemn) the immorality and
impiety of an [[opinion]]; yet if, in pursuance of that private [[judgment]],
though backed by the [[public]] [[judgment]] of his [[country]] or his
contemporaries, he prevents the [[opinion]] from being heard in its defence,
he assumes infallibility. and so far from the assumption being less
objectionable or less dangerous because the [[opinion]] is called immoral or
impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal. these
are exactly the occasions [[occasion]] on which the [[men]] of one [[generation]] commit
those dreadful mistakes, which excite the astonishment and [[horror]] of
posterity. it is among such that we find the instances memorable in
history, when the arm of the [[law]] has been employed to root out the best
men and the noblest doctrines; with deplorable [[success]] as to the [[men]],
though some of the doctrines have survived to be (as if in mockery)
invoked, in defence of similar conduct towards those who dissent from
_them_, or from their received interpretation.

mankind can hardly be too often reminded that there was once a [[man]] named
socrates, between whom and the legal authorities [[authority]] and [[public]] [[opinion]] of
his [[time]], there took place a memorable collision. born in an [[age]] and
country abounding in [[individual]] greatness, this [[man]] has been handed down
to us by those who [[best]] knew both him and the [[age]], as the most virtuous
man in it; while _we_ [[know]] him as the head and prototype of all
subsequent teachers of [[virtue]], the source equally of the lofty
inspiration of [[plato]] and the judicious utilitarianism of [[aristotle]], "_i
maëstri di color che sanno_," the two headsprings of ethical as of all
other [[philosophy]]. this acknowledged master of all the eminent thinkers
who have since lived--whose fame, still growing after more than two
thousand years, all but outweighs the whole remainder of the names which
make his native [[city]] illustrious--was put to [[death]] by his countrymen,
after a judicial conviction, for impiety and immorality. impiety, in
denying the gods recognised by the [[state]]; indeed his accuser asserted
(see the "apologia") that he believed in no gods at all. immorality, in
being, by his doctrines and instructions, a "corruptor of [[youth]]." of
these charges the tribunal, there is every ground for believing,
honestly found him guilty, and condemned the [[man]] who probably of all
then born had deserved [[best]] of [[mankind]], to be put to [[death]] as a
criminal.

to pass from this to the only other instance of judicial [[iniquity]], the
mention of which, after the condemnation of [[socrates]], would not be an
anticlimax: the event which took place on calvary rather more than
eighteen hundred years ago. the [[man]] who left on the memory of those who
witnessed his [[life]] and conversation, such an impression of his moral
grandeur, that eighteen subsequent centuries have done homage to him as
the almighty in [[person]], was ignominiously put to [[death]], as what? as a
blasphemer. [[men]] did not merely mistake their benefactor; they mistook
him for the exact contrary of what he was, and treated him as that
prodigy of impiety, which they themselves are now held to be, for their
treatment of him. the feelings with which [[mankind]] now regard these
lamentable transactions, especially the later of the two, render them
extremely [[unjust]] in their [[judgment]] of the unhappy actors. these were, to
all appearance, not [[bad]] men--not worse than [[men]] commonly are, but rather
the contrary; [[men]] who possessed in a full, or somewhat more than a full
measure, the [[religious]], [[moral]], and patriotic feelings of their [[time]] and
people: the very [[kind]] of [[men]] who, in all times [[time]], our own included, have
every [[chance]] of passing through [[life]] blameless and respected. the
high-priest who rent his garments when the words were pronounced, which,
according to all the ideas [[idea]] of his [[country]], constituted the blackest
guilt, was in all probability quite as sincere in his [[horror]] and
indignation, as the generality of respectable and pious [[men]] now are in
the [[religious]] and [[moral]] sentiments they profess; and most of those who
now shudder at his conduct, if they had lived in his [[time]], and been born
jews, would have acted precisely as he did. orthodox christians [[christian]] who are
tempted to [[think]] that those who stoned to [[death]] the first martyrs must
have been worse [[men]] than they themselves are, ought to [[remember]] that one
of those persecutors was saint paul.

let us add one more [[example]], the most striking of all, if the
impressiveness of an error is measured by the [[wisdom]] and [[virtue]] of him
who falls into it. if ever any one, possessed of [[power]], had grounds for
thinking himself the [[best]] and most enlightened among his cotemporaries,
it was the [[emperor]] marcus aurelius. absolute monarch of the whole
civilised [[world]], he preserved through [[life]] not only the most unblemished
justice, but what was less to be expected from his stoical breeding, the
tenderest [[heart]]. the few failings which are attributed to him, were all
on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical
product of the ancient [[mind]], differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ
at all, from the most characteristic teachings of [[christ]]. this [[man]], a
better [[christian]] in all but the dogmatic sense of the word, than almost
any of the ostensibly [[christian]] sovereigns [[sovereign]] who have since reigned,
persecuted [[christianity]]. placed at the summit of all the previous
attainments of [[humanity]], with an open, unfettered [[intellect]], and a
character which [[led]] him of himself to embody in his [[moral]] writings the
christian ideal, he yet failed to see that [[christianity]] was to be a good
and not an [[evil]] to the [[world]], with his duties [[duty]] to which he was so deeply
penetrated. existing [[society]] he knew to be in a deplorable [[state]]. but
such as it was, he saw, or [[thought]] he saw, that it was held together,
and prevented from being worse, by [[belief]] and reverence of the received
divinities. as a ruler of [[mankind]], he deemed it his [[duty]] not to suffer
society to fall in pieces; and saw not how, if its existing ties were
removed, any others could be formed which could again knit it together.
the new [[religion]] openly aimed at dissolving these ties: unless,
therefore, it was his [[duty]] to adopt that [[religion]], it seemed to be his
duty to put it down. inasmuch then as the theology of [[christianity]] did
not appear to him true or of [[divine]] origin; inasmuch as this strange
history of a crucified [[god]] was not credible to him, and a [[system]] which
purported to rest entirely upon a foundation to him so wholly
unbelievable, could not be foreseen by him to be that renovating agency
which, after all abatements, it has in [[fact]] proved to be; the gentlest
and most amiable of [[philosophers]] and rulers, under a solemn sense of
duty, authorised the persecution of [[christianity]]. to my [[mind]] this is one
of the most tragical facts [[fact]] in all [[history]]. it is a bitter [[thought]], how
different a thing the [[christianity]] of the [[world]] might have been, if the
christian [[faith]] had been adopted as the [[religion]] of the [[empire]] under the
auspices of marcus aurelius instead of those of constantine. but it
would be equally [[unjust]] to him and false to [[truth]], to deny, that no one
plea which can be urged for punishing anti-christian teaching, was
wanting to marcus aurelius for punishing, as he did, the propagation of
christianity. no [[christian]] more firmly believes [[belief]] that atheism is false,
and tends to the dissolution of [[society]], than marcus aurelius believed
the same things of [[christianity]]; he who, of all [[men]] then living, might
have been [[thought]] the most capable of appreciating it. unless any one
who approves of [[punishment]] for the promulgation of opinions [[opinion]], flatters
himself that he is a wiser and [[better]] [[man]] than marcus aurelius--more
deeply versed in the [[wisdom]] of his [[time]], more elevated in his intellect
above it--more earnest in his search for [[truth]], or more single-minded in
his devotion to it when found;--let him abstain from that assumption of
the joint infallibility of himself and the multitude, which the great
antoninus made with so unfortunate a result.

aware of the impossibility of defending the use of [[punishment]] for
restraining irreligious opinions [[opinion]], by any argument which will not justify
marcus antoninus, the enemies [[enemy]] of [[religious]] [[freedom]], when hard pressed,
occasionally accept this consequence, and say, with dr. johnson, that
the persecutors of [[christianity]] were in the [[right]]; that persecution is
an ordeal through which [[truth]] ought to pass, and always passes
successfully, legal penalties being, in the end, powerless against
truth, though sometimes beneficially effective against mischievous
errors. this is a form of the argument for [[religious]] intolerance,
sufficiently remarkable not to be passed without notice.

a theory which maintains that [[truth]] may justifiably be persecuted
because persecution cannot possibly do it any harm, cannot be charged
with being intentionally hostile to the reception of new truths [[truth]]; but we
cannot commend the generosity of its dealing with the persons [[person]] to whom
mankind are indebted for them. to discover to the [[world]] something which
deeply concerns it, and of which it was previously ignorant; to prove to
it that it had been mistaken on some vital point of temporal or
spiritual interest, is as important a service as a [[human]] being can
render to his fellow-creatures, and in [[certain]] cases, as in those of the
early christians [[christian]] and of the reformers, those who [[think]] with dr. johnson
believe it to have been the most precious gift which could be bestowed
on [[mankind]]. that the authors of such splendid benefits should be
requited by martyrdom; that their [[reward]] should be to be dealt with as
the vilest of criminals [[criminal]], is not, upon this theory, a deplorable error
and misfortune, for which [[humanity]] should mourn in sackcloth and ashes,
but the normal and justifiable [[state]] of things. the propounder of a new
truth, according to this doctrine, should stand, as stood, in the
legislation of the locrians, the proposer of a new [[law]], with a halter
round his neck, to be instantly tightened if the [[public]] assembly did
not, on hearing his reasons [[reason]], then and there adopt his proposition.
people who defend this mode of treating benefactors, cannot be supposed
to set much value on the benefit; and i [[believe]] this view of the subject
is mostly confined to the sort of persons [[person]] who [[think]] that new truths [[truth]] may
have been desirable once, but that we have had enough of them now.

but, indeed, the dictum that [[truth]] always triumphs over persecution, is
one of those pleasant falsehoods which [[men]] repeat after one another
till they pass into commonplaces, but which all [[experience]] refutes.
history teems with instances of [[truth]] put down by persecution. if not
suppressed for ever, it may be thrown back for centuries. to speak only
of [[religious]] opinions [[opinion]]: the reformation broke out at least twenty times
before luther, and was put down. arnold of brescia was put down. fra
dolcino was put down. savonarola was put down. the albigeois were put
down. the vaudois were put down. the lollards were put down. the
hussites were put down. even after the era of luther, wherever
persecution was persisted in, it was successful. in [[spain]], [[italy]],
flanders, the austrian [[empire]], protestantism was rooted out; and, most
likely, would have been so in [[england]], had queen [[mary]] lived, or queen
elizabeth died. persecution has always succeeded, save where the
heretics were too [[strong]] a party to be effectually persecuted. no
reasonable [[person]] can [[doubt]] that [[christianity]] might have been extirpated
in the roman [[empire]]. it spread, and became predominant, because the
persecutions were only occasional, lasting but a short [[time]], and
separated by long intervals of almost undisturbed propagandism. it is a
piece of idle sentimentality that [[truth]], merely as [[truth]], has any
inherent [[power]] denied to error, of prevailing against the dungeon and
the stake. [[men]] are not more zealous for [[truth]] than they often are for
error, and a sufficient application of legal or even of social penalties
will generally succeed in stopping the propagation of either. the real
advantage which [[truth]] has, consists in this, that when an [[opinion]] is
true, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times [[time]], but in the
course of ages [[age]] there will generally be found persons [[person]] to rediscover it,
until some one of its reappearances falls on a [[time]] when from favourable
circumstances it escapes persecution until it has made such head as to
withstand all subsequent attempts to suppress it.

it will be said, that we do not now put to [[death]] the introducers of new
opinions: we are not like our fathers [[father]] who slew the prophets [[prophet]], we even
build sepulchres to them. it is true we no longer put heretics to [[death]];
and the amount of penal infliction which [[modern]] feeling would probably
tolerate, even against the most obnoxious opinions [[opinion]], is not sufficient to
extirpate them. but let us not flatter ourselves that we are yet free
from the stain even of legal persecution. penalties for [[opinion]], or at
least for its expression, still [[exist]] by [[law]]; and their enforcement is
not, even in these times [[time]], so unexampled as to make it at all incredible
that they may some day be revived in full [[force]]. in the year 1857, at
the summer assizes of the county of cornwall, an unfortunate [[man]],[7]
said to be of unexceptionable conduct in all relations of [[life]], was
sentenced to twenty-one months' imprisonment, for uttering, and writing
on a gate, some offensive words concerning [[christianity]]. within a month
of the same [[time]], at the old bailey, two persons [[person]], on two separate
occasions,[8] were rejected as jurymen, and one of them grossly insulted
by the [[judge]] and by one of the counsel, because they honestly declared
that they had no theological [[belief]]; and a third, a foreigner,[9] for
the same [[reason]], was denied [[justice]] against a thief. this refusal of
redress took place in [[virtue]] of the legal doctrine, that no [[person]] can
be allowed to give evidence in a court of [[justice]], who does not profess
belief in a [[god]] (any [[god]] is sufficient) and in a future [[state]]; which is
equivalent to declaring such persons [[person]] to be outlaws, excluded from the
protection of the tribunals; who may not only be robbed or assaulted
with impunity, if no one but themselves, or persons [[person]] of similar opinions [[opinion]],
be [[present]], but any one else may be robbed or assaulted with impunity,
if the proof of the [[fact]] depends on their evidence. the assumption on
which this is grounded, is that the oath is worthless, of a [[person]] who
does not [[believe]] in a future [[state]]; a proposition which betokens much
ignorance of [[history]] in those who assent to it (since it is historically
true that a large proportion of infidels in all ages [[age]] have been persons
of distinguished integrity and honour); and would be maintained by no
one who had the smallest conception how many of the persons [[person]] in greatest
repute with the [[world]], both for virtues [[virtue]] and for attainments, are well
known, at least to their intimates, to be unbelievers. the [[rule]],
besides, is suicidal, and cuts away its own foundation. under pretence
that atheists must be liars, it admits the testimony of all atheists who
are willing to [[lie]], and rejects only those who brave the obloquy of
publicly confessing a detested creed rather than affirm a falsehood. a
rule thus self-convicted of absurdity so far as regards its professed
purpose, can be kept in [[force]] only as a badge of [[hatred]], a relic of
persecution; a persecution, too, having the peculiarity, that the
qualification for undergoing it, is the being clearly proved not to
deserve it. the [[rule]], and the theory it implies, are hardly less
insulting to believers than to infidels. for if he who does not believe
in a future [[state]], necessarily lies [[lie]], it follows that they who do believe
are only prevented from lying, if prevented they are, by the [[fear]] of
hell. we will not do the authors and abettors of the [[rule]] the injury of
supposing, that the conception which they have formed of christian
virtue is drawn from their own [[consciousness]].

these, indeed, are but rags and remnants of persecution, and may be
thought to be not so much an indication of the [[wish]] to [[persecute]], as an
example of that very frequent infirmity of english minds [[mind]], which makes
them take a preposterous [[pleasure]] in the assertion of a [[bad]] [[principle]],
when they are no longer [[bad]] enough to [[desire]] to carry it really into
practice. but unhappily there is no security in the [[state]] of the public
mind, that the suspension of worse forms of legal persecution, which has
lasted for about the space of a [[generation]], will continue. in this age
the quiet surface of routine is as often ruffled by attempts to
resuscitate [[past]] evils [[evil]], as to introduce new benefits. what is boasted of
at the [[present]] [[time]] as the revival of [[religion]], is always, in narrow
and uncultivated minds [[mind]], at least as much the revival of bigotry; and
where there is the [[strong]] permanent leaven of intolerance in the
feelings of a [[people]], which at all times [[time]] abides in the middle classes of
this [[country]], it needs but little to provoke them into actively
persecuting those whom they have never ceased to [[think]] proper objects of
persecution.[10] for it is this--it is the opinions [[opinion]] [[men]] entertain, and
the feelings they cherish, respecting those who disown the beliefs they
deem important, which makes this [[country]] not a place of mental [[freedom]].
for a long [[time]] [[past]], the [[chief]] mischief of the legal penalties is that
they strengthen the social stigma. it is that stigma which is really
effective, and so effective is it that the profession of opinions [[opinion]] which
are under the ban of [[society]] is much less [[common]] in [[england]], than is, in
many other countries [[country]], the avowal of those which incur risk of judicial
punishment. in [[respect]] to all persons [[person]] but those whose pecuniary
circumstances make them independent of the [[good]] will of other [[people]],
opinion, on this [[subject]], is as efficacious as [[law]]; [[men]] might as well be
imprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their bread. those
whose bread is already secured, and who [[desire]] no favours from [[men]] in
power, or from bodies [[body]] of [[men]], or from the [[public]], have nothing to fear
from the open avowal of any opinions [[opinion]], but to be ill-thought of and
ill-spoken of, and this it ought not to require a very heroic mould to
enable them to bear. there is no room for any appeal _ad misericordiam_
in behalf of such persons [[person]]. but though we do not now inflict so much evil
on those who [[think]] differently from us, as it was formerly our custom to
do, it may be that we do ourselves as much [[evil]] as ever by our treatment
of them. [[socrates]] was put to [[death]], but the socratic [[philosophy]] rose
like the sun in [[heaven]], and spread its illumination over the whole
intellectual firmament. christians [[christian]] were cast to the lions, but the
christian [[church]] grew up a stately and spreading tree, overtopping the
older and less vigorous growths, and stifling them by its shade. our
merely social intolerance kills no one, roots out no opinions [[opinion]], but
induces [[men]] to [[disguise]] them, or to abstain from any active effort for
their diffusion. with us, heretical opinions [[opinion]] do not perceptibly gain, or
even lose, ground in each decade or [[generation]]; they never blaze out far
and wide, but continue to smoulder in the narrow circles of thinking and
studious persons [[person]] among whom they originate, without ever lighting up the
general affairs of [[mankind]] with either a true or a deceptive [[light]]. and
thus is kept up a [[state]] of things very satisfactory to some minds [[mind]],
because, without the unpleasant process of fining or imprisoning
anybody, it maintains all prevailing opinions [[opinion]] outwardly undisturbed,
while it does not absolutely interdict the exercise of [[reason]] by
dissentients afflicted with the malady of [[thought]]. a convenient plan for
having [[peace]] in the intellectual [[world]], and keeping all things going on
therein very much as they do already. but the price paid for this sort
of intellectual pacification, is the [[sacrifice]] of the entire moral
courage of the [[human]] [[mind]]. a [[state]] of things in which a large portion of
the most active and inquiring intellects find it advisable to keep the
genuine principles [[principle]] and grounds of their convictions within their own
breasts, and attempt, in what they address to the [[public]], to fit as much
as they can of their own conclusions to premises which they have
internally renounced, cannot send forth the open, fearless characters [[character]],
and logical, consistent intellects who once adorned the thinking [[world]].
the sort of [[men]] who can be looked for under it, are either mere
conformers to commonplace, or time-servers for [[truth]], whose arguments on
all [[great]] subjects [[subject]] are meant for their hearers, and are not those which
have convinced themselves. those who avoid this alternative, do so by
narrowing their thoughts [[thought]] and interest to things which can be spoken of
without venturing within the region of principles [[principle]], that is, to small
practical matters, which would come [[right]] of themselves, if but the
minds of [[mankind]] were strengthened and enlarged, and which will never be
made effectually [[right]] until then: while that which would strengthen and
enlarge men's minds [[mind]], [[free]] and daring speculation on the highest
subjects, is abandoned.

those in whose [[eyes]] this reticence on the part of heretics is no [[evil]],
should consider in the first place, that in consequence of it there is
never any [[fair]] and thorough discussion of heretical opinions [[opinion]]; and that
such of them as could not stand such a discussion, though they may be
prevented from spreading, do not disappear. but it is not the minds [[mind]] of
heretics that are deteriorated most, by the ban placed on all inquiry
which does not end in the orthodox conclusions. the [[greatest]] harm done
is to those who are not heretics, and whose whole mental [[development]] is
cramped, and their [[reason]] cowed, by the [[fear]] of heresy. who can compute
what the [[world]] loses in the multitude of promising intellects combined
with timid characters [[character]], who dare not [[follow]] out any bold, vigorous,
independent train of [[thought]], lest it should [[land]] them in something
which would admit of being considered irreligious or immoral? among
them we may occasionally see some [[man]] of deep conscientiousness, and
subtle and refined understanding, who spends a [[life]] in sophisticating
with an [[intellect]] which he cannot [[silence]], and exhausts the resources of
ingenuity in attempting to reconcile the promptings of his conscience
and [[reason]] with orthodoxy, which yet he does not, perhaps, to the end
succeed in doing. no one can be a [[great]] thinker who does not recognise,
that as a thinker it is his first [[duty]] to [[follow]] his [[intellect]] to
whatever conclusions it may lead. [[truth]] gains more even by the errors of
one who, with due study and preparation, thinks [[think]] for himself, than by the
true opinions [[opinion]] of those who only hold them because they do not suffer
themselves to [[think]]. not that it is solely, or chiefly, to form great
thinkers, that [[freedom]] of thinking is required. on the contrary, it is
as much, and even more indispensable, to enable average [[human]] beings to
attain the mental stature which they are capable of. there have been,
and may again be, [[great]] [[individual]] thinkers, in a general atmosphere of
mental [[slavery]]. but there never has been, nor ever will be, in that
atmosphere, an intellectually active [[people]]. where any [[people]] has made a
temporary approach to such a [[character]], it has been because the dread
of heterodox speculation was for a [[time]] suspended. where there is a
tacit convention that principles [[principle]] are not to be disputed; where the
discussion of the [[greatest]] questions [[question]] which can occupy [[humanity]] is
considered to be closed, we cannot [[hope]] to find that generally high
scale of mental activity which has made some periods of [[history]] so
remarkable. never when controversy avoided the subjects [[subject]] which are large
and important enough to kindle enthusiasm, was the [[mind]] of a people
stirred up from its foundations, and the impulse given which raised even
persons of the most ordinary [[intellect]] to something of the [[dignity]] of
thinking beings. of such we have had an [[example]] in the condition of
europe during the times [[time]] immediately following the reformation; another,
though limited to the continent and to a more cultivated class, in the
speculative movement of the latter half of the eighteenth century; and a
third, of still briefer duration, in the intellectual fermentation of
germany during the goethian and fichtean period. these periods differed
widely in the particular opinions [[opinion]] which they developed; but were alike
in this, that during all three the yoke of [[authority]] was broken. in
each, an old mental despotism had been thrown off, and no new one had
yet taken its place. the impulse given at these three periods has made
europe what it now is. every [[single]] improvement which has taken place
either in the [[human]] [[mind]] or in [[institutions]], may be traced distinctly to
one or other of them. appearances have for some [[time]] indicated that all
three impulses are well-nigh spent; and we can expect no fresh start,
until we again assert our mental [[freedom]].

let us now pass to the second division of the argument, and dismissing
the supposition that any of the received opinions [[opinion]] may be false, let us
assume them to be true, and examine into the worth of the manner in
which they are likely to be held, when their [[truth]] is not freely and
openly canvassed. however unwillingly a [[person]] who has a [[strong]] opinion
may admit the possibility that his [[opinion]] may be false, he ought to be
moved by the consideration that however true it may be, if it is not
fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead
dogma, not a living [[truth]].

there is a class of persons [[person]] (happily not quite so numerous as formerly)
who [[think]] it enough if a [[person]] assents undoubtingly to what they think
true, though he has no [[knowledge]] whatever of the grounds of the [[opinion]],
and could not make a tenable defence of it against the most superficial
objections. such persons [[person]], if they can once get their creed taught from
authority, naturally [[think]] that no [[good]], and some harm, comes of its
being allowed to be questioned. where their influence prevails, they
make it nearly impossible for the received [[opinion]] to be rejected wisely
and considerately, though it may still be rejected rashly and
ignorantly; for to shut out discussion entirely is seldom possible, and
when it once gets in, beliefs not grounded on conviction are apt to give
way before the slightest semblance of an argument. waiving, however,
this possibility--assuming that the true [[opinion]] abides in the [[mind]], but
abides as a prejudice, a [[belief]] independent of, and proof against,
argument--this is not the way in which [[truth]] ought to be held by a
rational being. this is not knowing the [[truth]]. [[truth]], thus held, is but
one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which
enunciate a [[truth]].

if the [[intellect]] and [[judgment]] of [[mankind]] ought to be cultivated, a thing
which protestants at least do not deny, on what can these faculties be
more appropriately exercised by any one, than on the things which
concern him so much that it is considered necessary for him to hold
opinions on them? if the cultivation of the understanding consists in
one thing more than in another, it is surely in learning the grounds of
one's own opinions [[opinion]]. whatever [[people]] [[believe]], on subjects [[subject]] on which it is
of the first importance to [[believe]] rightly, they ought to be able to
defend against at least the [[common]] objections. but, some one may say,
"let them be _taught_ the grounds of their opinions [[opinion]]. it does not follow
that opinions [[opinion]] must be merely parroted because they are never heard
controverted. persons [[person]] who learn geometry do not simply commit the
theorems to memory, but [[understand]] and learn likewise the
demonstrations; and it would be absurd to say that they remain ignorant
of the grounds of geometrical truths [[truth]], because they never hear any one
deny, and attempt to disprove them." undoubtedly: and such teaching
suffices on a [[subject]] like mathematics, where there is nothing at all to
be said on the [[wrong]] side of the [[question]]. the peculiarity of the
evidence of mathematical truths [[truth]] is, that all the argument is on one
side. there are no objections, and no answers [[answer]] to objections. but on
every [[subject]] on which difference of [[opinion]] is possible, the truth
depends on a balance to be struck between two sets of conflicting
reasons. even in [[natural]] [[philosophy]], there is always some other
explanation possible of the same facts [[fact]]; some geocentric theory instead
of heliocentric, some phlogiston instead of oxygen; and it has to be
shown why that other theory cannot be the true one: and until this is
shown, and until we [[know]] how it is shown, we do not [[understand]] the
grounds of our [[opinion]]. but when we turn to subjects [[subject]] infinitely more
complicated, to morals [[moral]], [[religion]], [[politics]], social relations, and the
business of [[life]], three-fourths of the arguments for every disputed
opinion consist in dispelling the appearances which favour some opinion
different from it. the [[greatest]] orator, save one, of antiquity, has left
it on record that he always [[studied]] his adversary's case with as [[great]],
if not with still greater, intensity than even his own. what cicero
practised as the means of forensic [[success]], requires to be imitated by
all who study any [[subject]] in order to arrive at the [[truth]]. he who knows
only his own side of the case, knows [[know]] little of that. his reasons [[reason]] may be
good, and no one may have been able to refute them. but if he is equally
unable to refute the reasons [[reason]] on the opposite side; if he does not so
much as [[know]] what they are, he has no ground for preferring either
opinion. the [[rational]] position for him would be suspension of [[judgment]],
and unless he contents himself with that, he is either [[led]] by
authority, or adopts, like the generality of the [[world]], the side to
which he feels [[feel]] most inclination. nor is it enough that he should hear
the arguments of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they
state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. that is
not the way to do [[justice]] to the arguments, or bring them into real
contact with his own [[mind]]. he must be able to hear them from persons [[person]] who
actually [[believe]] them; who defend them in earnest, and do their very
utmost for them. he must [[know]] them in their most plausible and
persuasive form; he must [[feel]] the whole [[force]] of the difficulty which
the true view of the [[subject]] has to encounter and dispose of; else he
will never really possess himself of the portion of [[truth]] which meets
and removes that difficulty. ninety-nine in a hundred of what are called
educated [[men]] are in this condition; even of those who can argue fluently
for their opinions [[opinion]]. their conclusion may be true, but it might be false
for anything they [[know]]: they have never thrown themselves into the
mental position of those who [[think]] differently from them, and considered
what such persons [[person]] may have to say; and consequently they do not, in any
proper sense of the word, [[know]] the doctrine which they themselves
profess. they do not [[know]] those parts of it which explain and justify
the remainder; the considerations which show that a [[fact]] which seemingly
conflicts with another is reconcilable with it, or that, of two
apparently [[strong]] reasons [[reason]], one and not the other ought to be preferred.
all that part of the [[truth]] which turns the scale, and decides the
judgment of a completely informed [[mind]], they are strangers to; nor is it
ever really known, but to those who have attended equally and
impartially to both sides, and endeavoured to see the reasons [[reason]] of both in
the strongest [[light]]. so essential is this discipline to a real
understanding of [[moral]] and [[human]] subjects [[subject]], that if opponents of all
important truths [[truth]] do not [[exist]], it is indispensable to imagine them, and
supply them with the strongest arguments which the most skilful devil's
advocate can conjure up.

to abate the [[force]] of these considerations, an [[enemy]] of [[free]] discussion
may be supposed to say, that there is no necessity for [[mankind]] in
general to [[know]] and [[understand]] all that can be said against or for their
opinions by [[philosophers]] and theologians. that it is not needful for
common [[men]] to be able to expose all the misstatements or fallacies of an
ingenious opponent. that it is enough if there is always somebody
capable of answering them, so that nothing likely to mislead
uninstructed persons [[person]] remains unrefuted. that simple minds [[mind]], having been
taught the obvious grounds of the truths [[truth]] inculcated on them, may trust
to [[authority]] for the rest, and being aware that they have neither
knowledge nor talent to resolve every difficulty which can be raised,
may repose in the assurance that all those which have been raised have
been or can be answered, by those who are specially trained to the task.

conceding to this view of the [[subject]] the utmost that can be claimed for
it by those most easily satisfied with the amount of understanding of
truth which ought to accompany the [[belief]] of it; even so, the argument
for [[free]] discussion is no way weakened. for even this doctrine
acknowledges that [[mankind]] ought to have a [[rational]] assurance that all
objections have been satisfactorily answered; and how are they to be
answered if that which requires to be answered is not spoken? or how can
the [[answer]] be known to be satisfactory, if the objectors have no
opportunity of showing that it is unsatisfactory? if not the [[public]], at
least the [[philosophers]] and theologians who are to resolve the
difficulties, must make themselves familiar with those difficulties in
their most puzzling form; and this cannot be accomplished unless they
are freely stated, and placed in the most advantageous [[light]] which they
admit of. the catholic [[church]] has its own way of dealing with this
embarrassing problem. it makes a broad separation between those who can
be permitted to receive its doctrines on conviction, and those who must
accept them on trust. neither, indeed, are allowed any [[choice]] as to what
they will accept; but the clergy, such at least as can be fully confided
in, may admissibly and meritoriously make themselves acquainted with the
arguments of opponents, in order to [[answer]] them, and may, therefore,
read heretical books [[book]]; the laity, not unless by special permission, hard
to be obtained. this discipline recognises a [[knowledge]] of the enemy's
case as beneficial to the teachers, but finds means, consistent with
this, of denying it to the rest of the [[world]]: thus giving to the _élite_
more mental [[culture]], though not more mental [[freedom]], than it allows to
the mass. by this device it succeeds in obtaining the [[kind]] of mental
superiority which its purposes [[purpose]] require; for though [[culture]] without
freedom never made a large and liberal [[mind]], it can make a clever _nisi
prius_ advocate of a cause. but in countries [[country]] professing protestantism,
this resource is denied; since protestants hold, at least in theory,
that the responsibility for the [[choice]] of a [[religion]] must be borne by
each for himself, and cannot be thrown off upon teachers. besides, in
the [[present]] [[state]] of the [[world]], it is practically impossible that
writings which are [[read]] by the instructed can be kept from the
uninstructed. if the teachers of [[mankind]] are to be cognisant of all that
they ought to [[know]], everything must be [[free]] to be written and published
without restraint.

if, however, the mischievous operation of the absence of free
discussion, when the received opinions [[opinion]] are true, were confined to
leaving [[men]] ignorant of the grounds of those opinions [[opinion]], it might be
thought that this, if an intellectual, is no [[moral]] [[evil]], and does not
affect the worth of the opinions [[opinion]], regarded in their influence on the
character. the [[fact]], however, is, that not only the grounds of the
opinion are forgotten in the absence of discussion, but too often the
meaning of the [[opinion]] itself. the words which convey it, cease to
suggest ideas [[idea]], or suggest only a small portion of those they were
originally employed to communicate. instead of a vivid conception and a
living [[belief]], there remain only a few phrases retained by rote; or, if
any part, the shell and husk only of the meaning is retained, the finer
essence being lost. the [[great]] [[chapter]] in [[human]] [[history]] which this fact
occupies and fills, cannot be too earnestly [[studied]] and meditated on.

it is illustrated in the [[experience]] of almost all ethical doctrines and
religious creeds. they are all full of meaning and vitality to those who
originate them, and to the direct disciples of the originators. their
meaning continues to be [[felt]] in undiminished [[strength]], and is perhaps
brought out into even fuller [[consciousness]], so long as the struggle
lasts to give the doctrine or creed an ascendency over other creeds. at
last it either prevails, and becomes the general [[opinion]], or its
progress stops; it keeps possession of the ground it has gained, but
ceases to spread further. when either of these results has become
apparent, controversy on the [[subject]] flags, and gradually dies away. the
doctrine has taken its place, if not as a received [[opinion]], as one of
the admitted sects or divisions of [[opinion]]: those who hold it have
generally inherited, not adopted it; and conversion from one of these
doctrines to another, being now an exceptional [[fact]], occupies little
place in the thoughts [[thought]] of their professors. instead of being, as at
first, constantly on the alert either to defend themselves against the
world, or to bring the [[world]] over to them, they have subsided into
acquiescence, and neither listen, when they can [[help]] it, to arguments
against their creed, nor trouble dissentients (if there be such) with
arguments in its favour. from this [[time]] may usually be dated the decline
in the living [[power]] of the doctrine. we often hear the teachers of all
creeds lamenting the difficulty of keeping up in the minds [[mind]] of believers
a lively apprehension of the [[truth]] which they nominally recognise, so
that it may penetrate the feelings, and acquire a real mastery over the
conduct. no such difficulty is complained of while the creed is still
fighting for its existence: even the weaker combatants then [[know]] and
feel what they are fighting for, and the difference between it and other
doctrines; and in that period of every creed's existence, not a few
persons may be found, who have realised its fundamental principles [[principle]] in
all the forms of [[thought]], have weighed and considered them in all their
important bearings, and have experienced the full effect on the
character, which [[belief]] in that creed ought to [[produce]] in a mind
thoroughly imbued with it. but when it has come to be a hereditary
creed, and to be received passively, not actively--when the [[mind]] is no
longer compelled, in the same [[degree]] as at first, to exercise its vital
powers on the questions [[question]] which its [[belief]] presents [[present]] to it, there is a
progressive tendency to forget all of the [[belief]] except the
formularies, or to give it a dull and torpid assent, as if accepting it
on trust dispensed with the necessity of realising it in [[consciousness]],
or testing it by personal [[experience]]; until it almost ceases to connect
itself at all with the inner [[life]] of the [[human]] being. then are seen the
cases, so frequent in this [[age]] of the [[world]] as almost to form the
majority, in which the creed remains as it were outside the [[mind]],
encrusting and petrifying it against all other influences addressed to
the higher parts of our [[nature]]; manifesting its [[power]] by not suffering
any fresh and living conviction to get in, but itself doing nothing for
the [[mind]] or [[heart]], except standing sentinel over them to keep them
vacant.

to what an extent doctrines intrinsically fitted to make the deepest
impression upon the [[mind]] may remain in it as [[dead]] beliefs, without being
ever realised in the [[imagination]], the feelings, or the understanding, is
exemplified by the manner in which the majority of believers hold the
doctrines of [[christianity]]. by [[christianity]] i here mean what is accounted
such by all churches [[church]] and sects--the maxims [[maxim]] and precepts contained in the
new testament. these are considered [[sacred]], and accepted as laws [[law]], by all
professing christians [[christian]]. yet it is scarcely too much to say that not one
christian in a thousand guides or tests his [[individual]] conduct by
reference to those laws [[law]]. the standard to which he does refer it, is the
custom of his nation, his class, or his [[religious]] profession. he has
thus, on the one hand, a collection of ethical maxims [[maxim]], which he believes
to have been vouchsafed to him by infallible [[wisdom]] as rules [[rule]] for his
government; and on the other, a set of every-day judgments [[judgment]] and
practices, which go a [[certain]] length with some of those maxims [[maxim]], not so
great a length with others, stand in direct opposition to some, and are,
on the whole, a compromise between the [[christian]] creed and the interests
and suggestions of worldly [[life]]. to the first of these standards he
gives his homage; to the other his real allegiance. all christians
believe that the blessed are the [[poor]] and humble, and those who are
ill-used by the [[world]]; that it is easier for a camel to pass through the
eye of a needle than for a [[rich]] [[man]] to enter the [[kingdom]] of [[heaven]]; that
they should [[judge]] not, lest they be judged; that they should swear not
at all; that they should [[love]] their neighbour as themselves; that if one
take their cloak, they should give him their coat also; that they should
take no [[thought]] for the morrow; that if they would be [[perfect]], they
should sell all that they have and give it to the [[poor]]. they are not
insincere when they say that they [[believe]] these things. they do believe
them, as [[people]] [[believe]] what they have always heard lauded and never
discussed. but in the sense of that living [[belief]] which regulates
conduct, they [[believe]] these doctrines just up to the point to which it
is usual to act upon them. the doctrines in their integrity are
serviceable to pelt adversaries with; and it is understood that they are
to be put forward (when possible) as the reasons [[reason]] for whatever [[people]] do
that they [[think]] laudable. but any one who reminded them that the maxims
require an infinity of things which they never even [[think]] of doing,
would gain nothing but to be classed among those very unpopular
characters who affect to be [[better]] than other [[people]]. the doctrines have
no hold on ordinary believers--are not a [[power]] in their minds [[mind]]. they have
a habitual [[respect]] for the sound of them, but no feeling which spreads
from the words to the things signified, and forces [[force]] the [[mind]] to take
_them_ in, and make them conform to the formula. whenever conduct is
concerned, they look round for mr. a and b to direct them how far to go
in obeying [[christ]].

now we may be well assured that the case was not thus, but far
otherwise, with the early christians [[christian]]. had it been thus, christianity
never would have expanded from an obscure sect of the despised hebrews
into the [[religion]] of the roman [[empire]]. when their enemies [[enemy]] said, "see how
these christians [[christian]] [[love]] one another" (a remark not likely to be made by
anybody now), they assuredly had a much livelier feeling of the meaning
of their creed than they have ever had since. and to this cause,
probably, it is chiefly owing that [[christianity]] now makes so little
progress in extending its domain, and after eighteen centuries, is still
nearly confined to europeans [[european]] and the descendants of europeans [[european]]. even with
the strictly [[religious]], who are much in earnest about their doctrines,
and attach a greater amount of meaning to many of them than [[people]] in
general, it commonly happens that the part which is thus comparatively
active in their minds [[mind]] is that which was made by calvin, or knox, or some
such [[person]] much nearer in [[character]] to themselves. the sayings of
christ coexist passively in their minds [[mind]], producing hardly any effect
beyond what is caused by mere listening to words so amiable and bland.
there are many reasons [[reason]], doubtless, why doctrines which are the badge of
a sect retain more of their vitality than those [[common]] to all recognised
sects, and why more pains [[pain]] are taken by teachers to keep their meaning
alive; but one [[reason]] certainly is, that the peculiar doctrines are more
questioned, and have to be oftener defended against open gainsayers.
both teachers and learners go to sleep at their post, as soon as there
is no [[enemy]] in the field.

the same thing holds true, generally speaking, of all traditional
doctrines--those of prudence and [[knowledge]] of [[life]], as well as of morals
or [[religion]]. all languages [[language]] and literatures are full of general
observations on [[life]], both as to what it is, and how to conduct oneself
in it; observations which everybody knows [[know]], which everybody repeats, or
hears with acquiescence, which are received as truisms, yet of which
most [[people]] first truly learn the meaning, when [[experience]], generally of
a painful [[kind]], has made it a reality to them. how often, when smarting
under some unforeseen misfortune or disappointment, does a [[person]] call
to [[mind]] some proverb or [[common]] saying, familiar to him all his [[life]], the
meaning of which, if he had ever before [[felt]] it as he does now, would
have saved him from the calamity. there are indeed reasons [[reason]] for this,
other than the absence of discussion: there are many truths [[truth]] of which the
full meaning _cannot_ be realised, until personal [[experience]] has brought
it [[home]]. but much more of the meaning even of these would have been
understood, and what was understood would have been far more deeply
impressed on the [[mind]], if the [[man]] had been accustomed to hear it argued
_pro_ and _con_ by [[people]] who did [[understand]] it. the fatal tendency of
mankind to leave off thinking about a thing when it is no longer
doubtful, is the cause of half their errors. a contemporary author has
well spoken of "the deep slumber of a decided [[opinion]]."

but what! (it may be asked) is the absence of unanimity an indispensable
condition of true [[knowledge]]? is it necessary that some part of mankind
should persist in error, to enable any to realise the [[truth]]? does a
belief cease to be real and vital as soon as it is generally
received--and is a proposition never thoroughly understood and felt
unless some [[doubt]] of it remains? as soon as [[mankind]] have unanimously
accepted a [[truth]], does the [[truth]] perish within them? the highest aim and
best result of improved [[intelligence]], it has hitherto been [[thought]], is
to unite [[mankind]] more and more in the acknowledgment of all important
truths: and does the [[intelligence]] only [[last]] as long as it has not
achieved its object? do the fruits of [[conquest]] perish by the very
completeness of the [[victory]]?

i affirm no such thing. as [[mankind]] improve, the number of doctrines
which are no longer disputed or doubted will be constantly on the
increase: and the well-being of [[mankind]] may almost be measured by the
number and gravity of the truths [[truth]] which have reached the point of being
uncontested. the cessation, on one [[question]] after another, of serious
controversy, is one of the necessary incidents of the consolidation of
opinion; a consolidation as salutary in the case of true opinions [[opinion]], as it
is dangerous and noxious when the opinions [[opinion]] are erroneous. but though
this gradual narrowing of the bounds of [[diversity]] of [[opinion]] is
necessary in both senses of the term, being at once inevitable and
indispensable, we are not therefore obliged to conclude that all its
consequences must be beneficial. the loss of so important an aid to the
intelligent and living apprehension of a [[truth]], as is afforded by the
necessity of explaining it to, or defending it against, opponents,
though not sufficient to outweigh, is no trifling drawback from, the
benefit of its universal recognition. where this advantage can no longer
be had, i confess i should like to see the teachers of mankind
endeavouring to provide a substitute for it; some contrivance for making
the difficulties of the [[question]] as [[present]] to the learner's
consciousness, as if they were pressed upon him by a dissentient
champion, eager for his conversion.

but instead of seeking contrivances for this [[purpose]], they have lost
those they formerly had. the socratic dialectics, so magnificently
exemplified in the dialogues of [[plato]], were a contrivance of this
description. they were essentially a negative discussion of the great
questions of [[philosophy]] and [[life]], directed with consummate [[skill]] to the
purpose of convincing any one who had merely adopted the commonplaces of
received [[opinion]], that he did not [[understand]] the subject--that he as yet
attached no definite meaning to the doctrines he professed; in order
that, becoming aware of his ignorance, he might be put in the way to
attain a stable [[belief]], resting on a clear apprehension both of the
meaning of doctrines and of their evidence. the school disputations of
the middle ages [[age]] had a somewhat similar object. they were intended to
make sure that the pupil understood his own [[opinion]], and (by necessary
correlation) the [[opinion]] opposed to it, and could enforce the grounds of
the one and confute those of the other. these last-mentioned contests
had indeed the incurable defect, that the premises appealed to were
taken from [[authority]], not from [[reason]]; and, as a discipline to the [[mind]],
they were in every [[respect]] inferior to the powerful dialectics which
formed the intellects of the "socratici viri": but the [[modern]] [[mind]] owes
far more to both than it is generally willing to admit, and the present
modes of [[education]] contain nothing which in the smallest [[degree]] supplies
the place either of the one or of the other. a [[person]] who derives all
his instruction from teachers or books [[book]], even if he escape the besetting
temptation of contenting himself with cram, is under no compulsion to
hear both sides; accordingly it is far from a frequent accomplishment,
even among thinkers, to [[know]] both sides; and the weakest part of what
everybody says in defence of his [[opinion]], is what he intends as a reply
to antagonists. it is the [[fashion]] of the [[present]] [[time]] to disparage
negative logic--that which points out weaknesses in theory or errors in
practice, without establishing positive truths [[truth]]. such negative criticism
would indeed be [[poor]] enough as an ultimate result; but as a means to
attaining any positive [[knowledge]] or conviction worthy the name, it
cannot be valued too highly; and until [[people]] are again systematically
trained to it, there will be few [[great]] thinkers, and a low general
average of [[intellect]], in any but the mathematical and physical
departments of speculation. on any other [[subject]] no one's opinions
deserve the name of [[knowledge]], except so far as he has either had
forced upon him by others, or gone through of himself, the same mental
process which would have been required of him in carrying on an active
controversy with opponents. that, therefore, which when absent, it is so
indispensable, but so difficult, to create, how worse than absurd is it
to forego, when spontaneously offering itself! if there are any persons
who contest a received [[opinion]], or who will do so if [[law]] or [[opinion]] will
let them, let us thank them for it, open our minds [[mind]] to listen to them,
and rejoice that there is some one to do for us what we otherwise ought,
if we have any regard for either the certainty or the vitality of our
convictions, to do with much greater [[labour]] for ourselves.


it still remains to speak of one of the principal causes which make
diversity of [[opinion]] advantageous, and will continue to do so until
mankind shall have entered a stage of intellectual advancement which at
present seems at an incalculable distance. we have hitherto considered
only two possibilities: that the received [[opinion]] may be false, and some
other [[opinion]], consequently, true; or that, the received [[opinion]] being
true, a conflict with the opposite error is essential to a clear
apprehension and deep feeling of its [[truth]]. but there is a commoner
case than either of these; when the conflicting doctrines, instead of
being one true and the other false, share the [[truth]] between them; and
the nonconforming [[opinion]] is needed to supply the remainder of the
truth, of which the received doctrine embodies only a part. popular
opinions, on subjects [[subject]] not palpable to sense, are often true, but seldom
or never the whole [[truth]]. they are a part of the [[truth]]; sometimes a
greater, sometimes a smaller part, but exaggerated, distorted, and
disjoined from the truths [[truth]] by which they ought to be accompanied and
limited. heretical opinions [[opinion]], on the other hand, are generally some of
these suppressed and neglected truths [[truth]], bursting the bonds which kept
them down, and either seeking reconciliation with the [[truth]] contained in
the [[common]] [[opinion]], or fronting it as enemies [[enemy]], and setting themselves
up, with similar exclusiveness, as the whole [[truth]]. the latter case is
hitherto the most frequent, as, in the [[human]] [[mind]], one-sidedness has
always been the [[rule]], and many-sidedness the exception. hence, even in
revolutions of [[opinion]], one part of the [[truth]] usually sets while another
rises. even [[progress]], which ought to superadd, for the most part only
substitutes one partial and incomplete [[truth]] for another; improvement
consisting chiefly in this, that the new fragment of [[truth]] is more
wanted, more adapted to the needs of the [[time]], than that which it
displaces. such being the partial [[character]] of prevailing opinions [[opinion]], even
when resting on a true foundation; every [[opinion]] which embodies somewhat
of the portion of [[truth]] which the [[common]] [[opinion]] omits, ought to be
considered precious, with whatever amount of error and confusion that
truth may be blended. no sober [[judge]] of [[human]] affairs will [[feel]] bound to
be indignant because those who [[force]] on our notice truths [[truth]] which we
should otherwise have overlooked, overlook some of those which we see.
rather, he will [[think]] that so long as popular [[truth]] is one-sided, it is
more desirable than otherwise that unpopular [[truth]] should have one-sided
asserters too; such being usually the most energetic, and the most
likely to compel reluctant attention to the fragment of [[wisdom]] which
they proclaim as if it were the whole.

thus, in the eighteenth century, when nearly all the instructed, and all
those of the uninstructed who were [[led]] by them, were lost in admiration
of what is called civilisation, and of the marvels of [[modern]] [[science]],
literature, and [[philosophy]], and while greatly overrating the amount of
unlikeness between the [[men]] of [[modern]] and those of ancient times [[time]],
indulged the [[belief]] that the whole of the difference was in their own
favour; with what a salutary shock did the paradoxes of [[rousseau]] explode
like bombshells in the midst, dislocating the compact mass of one-sided
opinion, and forcing its elements to recombine in a [[better]] form and with
additional ingredients. not that the current opinions [[opinion]] were on the whole
farther from the [[truth]] than rousseau's were; on the contrary, they were
nearer to it; they contained more of positive [[truth]], and very much less
of error. nevertheless there lay in rousseau's doctrine, and has floated
down the stream of [[opinion]] along with it, a considerable amount of
exactly those truths [[truth]] which the popular [[opinion]] wanted; and these are the
deposit which was left behind when the flood subsided. the superior
worth of simplicity of [[life]], the enervating and demoralising effect of
the trammels and hypocrisies of artificial [[society]], are ideas [[idea]] which have
never been entirely absent from cultivated minds [[mind]] since [[rousseau]] wrote;
and they will in [[time]] [[produce]] their due effect, though at present
needing to be asserted as much as ever, and to be asserted by deeds, for
words, on this [[subject]], have nearly exhausted their [[power]].

in [[politics]], again, it is almost a commonplace, that a party of order
or stability, and a party of [[progress]] or reform, are both necessary
elements of a healthy [[state]] of [[political]] [[life]]; until the one or the
other shall have so enlarged its mental grasp as to be a party equally
of order and of [[progress]], knowing and distinguishing what is fit to be
preserved from what ought to be swept away. each of these modes of
thinking derives its utility from the deficiencies of the other; but it
is in a [[great]] measure the opposition of the other that keeps each within
the limits of [[reason]] and sanity. unless opinions [[opinion]] favourable to democracy
and to [[aristocracy]], to [[property]] and to equality, to co-operation and to
competition, to luxury and to abstinence, to sociality and
individuality, to [[liberty]] and discipline, and all the other standing
antagonisms of practical [[life]], are expressed with [[equal]] [[freedom]], and
enforced and defended with [[equal]] talent and energy, there is no chance
of both elements obtaining their due; one scale is sure to go up and the
other down. [[truth]], in the [[great]] practical concerns of [[life]], is so much a
question of the reconciling and combining of opposites, that very few
have minds [[mind]] sufficiently capacious and [[impartial]] to make the adjustment
with an approach to correctness, and it has to be made by the rough
process of a struggle between combatants fighting under hostile
banners. on any of the [[great]] open questions [[question]] just enumerated, if either
of the two opinions [[opinion]] has a [[better]] claim than the other, not merely to be
tolerated, but to be encouraged and countenanced, it is the one which
happens at the particular [[time]] and place to be in a minority. that is
the [[opinion]] which, for the [[time]] being, represents the neglected
interests, the side of [[human]] well-being which is in danger of obtaining
less than its share. i am aware that there is not, in this [[country]], any
intolerance of differences of [[opinion]] on most of these topics. they are
adduced to show, by admitted and multiplied examples [[example]], the universality
of the [[fact]], that only through [[diversity]] of [[opinion]] is there, in the
existing [[state]] of [[human]] [[intellect]], a [[chance]] of fair-play to all sides of
the [[truth]]. when there are persons [[person]] to be found, who form an exception to
the apparent unanimity of the [[world]] on any [[subject]], even if the [[world]] is
in the [[right]], it is always probable that dissentients have something
worth hearing to say for themselves, and that [[truth]] would lose something
by their [[silence]].

it may be objected, "but _some_ received principles [[principle]], especially on the
highest and most vital subjects [[subject]], are more than half-truths. the
christian morality, for instance, is the whole [[truth]] on that [[subject]],
and if any one teaches [[teach]] a morality which varies from it, he is wholly in
error." as this is of all cases the most important in practice, none can
be fitter to test the general [[maxim]]. but before pronouncing what
christian morality is or is not, it would be desirable to decide what is
meant by [[christian]] morality. if it means the morality of the new
testament, i wonder that any one who derives his [[knowledge]] of this from
the [[book]] itself, can suppose that it was announced, or intended, as a
complete doctrine of morals [[moral]]. the gospel always refers to a pre-existing
morality, and confines its precepts to the particulars in which that
morality was to be corrected, or superseded by a wider and higher;
expressing itself, moreover, in terms most general, often impossible to
be interpreted literally, and possessing rather the impressiveness of
poetry or eloquence than the precision of legislation. to extract from
it a [[body]] of ethical doctrine, has ever been possible without eking it
out from the old testament, that is, from a [[system]] elaborate indeed, but
in many respects [[respect]] barbarous, and intended only for a barbarous [[people]].
st. paul, a declared [[enemy]] to this judaical mode of interpreting the
doctrine and filling up the scheme of his master, equally assumes a
pre-existing morality, namely, that of the greeks [[greek]] and romans; and his
advice to christians [[christian]] is in a [[great]] measure a [[system]] of accommodation to
that; even to the extent of giving an apparent sanction to [[slavery]]. what
is called [[christian]], but should rather be termed theological, morality,
was not the [[work]] of [[christ]] or the [[apostles]], but is of much later origin,
having been gradually built up by the catholic [[church]] of the first five
centuries, and though not implicitly adopted by moderns and protestants,
has been much less modified by them than might have been expected. for
the most part, indeed, they have contented themselves with cutting off
the additions which had been made to it in the middle ages [[age]], each sect
supplying the place by fresh additions, adapted to its own [[character]] and
tendencies. that [[mankind]] owe a [[great]] debt to this morality, and to its
early teachers, i should be the [[last]] [[person]] to deny; but i do not
scruple to say of it, that it is, in many important points, incomplete
and one-sided, and that unless ideas [[idea]] and feelings, not sanctioned by it,
had contributed to the formation of [[european]] [[life]] and [[character]], human
affairs would have been in a worse condition than they now are.
christian morality (so called) has all the characters [[character]] of a reaction; it
is, in [[great]] part, a [[protest]] against paganism. its ideal is negative
rather than positive; passive rather than active; innocence rather than
nobleness; abstinence from [[evil]], rather than energetic pursuit of [[good]]:
in its precepts (as has been well said) "thou shalt not" predominates
unduly over "thou shalt." in its [[horror]] of sensuality, it made an idol
of asceticism, which has been gradually compromised away into one of
legality. it holds out the [[hope]] of [[heaven]] and the threat of hell, as the
appointed and appropriate motives to a [[virtuous]] [[life]]: in this falling
far below the [[best]] of the ancients, and doing what lies [[lie]] in it to give to
human morality an essentially selfish [[character]], by disconnecting each
man's feelings of [[duty]] from the interests of his fellow-creatures,
except so far as a self-interested inducement is offered to him for
consulting them. it is essentially a doctrine of passive [[obedience]]; it
inculcates submission to all authorities [[authority]] found established; who indeed
are not to be actively obeyed when they command what [[religion]] forbids,
but who are not to be resisted, far less rebelled against, for any
amount of [[wrong]] to ourselves. and while, in the morality of the best
pagan nations, [[duty]] to the [[state]] holds even a disproportionate place,
infringing on the just [[liberty]] of the [[individual]]; in purely christian
ethics, that grand department of [[duty]] is scarcely noticed or
acknowledged. it is in the koran, not the new testament, that we read
the maxim--"a ruler who appoints any [[man]] to an office, when there is in
his dominions another [[man]] [[better]] qualified for it, sins [[sin]] against [[god]] and
against the [[state]]." what little recognition the [[idea]] of obligation to
the [[public]] obtains in [[modern]] morality, is derived from [[greek]] and roman
sources, not from [[christian]]; as, even in the morality of private [[life]],
whatever exists of magnanimity, high-mindedness, personal [[dignity]], even
the sense of [[honour]], is derived from the purely [[human]], not the religious
part of our [[education]], and never could have grown out of a standard of
ethics in which the only worth, professedly recognised, is that of
obedience.

i am as far as any one from pretending that these defects are
necessarily inherent in the [[christian]] ethics, in every manner in which
it can be conceived, or that the many requisites of a complete moral
doctrine which it does not contain, do not admit of being reconciled
with it. far less would i insinuate this of the doctrines and precepts
of [[christ]] himself. i [[believe]] that the sayings of [[christ]] are all, that i
can see any evidence of their having been intended to be; that they are
irreconcilable with nothing which a comprehensive morality requires;
that everything which is excellent in ethics may be brought within them,
with no greater [[violence]] to their [[language]] than has been done to it by
all who have attempted to deduce from them any practical [[system]] of
conduct whatever. but it is quite consistent with this, to [[believe]] that
they contain, and were meant to contain, only a part of the [[truth]]; that
many essential elements of the highest morality are among the things
which are not provided for, nor intended to be provided for, in the
recorded deliverances of the founder of [[christianity]], and which have
been entirely thrown aside in the [[system]] of ethics erected on the basis
of those deliverances by the [[christian]] [[church]]. and this being so, i
think it a [[great]] error to persist in attempting to find in the christian
doctrine that complete [[rule]] for our guidance, which its author intended
it to sanction and enforce, but only partially to provide. i [[believe]],
too, that this narrow theory is becoming a grave practical [[evil]],
detracting greatly from the value of the [[moral]] training and instruction,
which so many well-meaning persons [[person]] are now at length exerting themselves
to promote. i much [[fear]] that by attempting to form the [[mind]] and feelings
on an exclusively [[religious]] type, and discarding those secular
standards (as for want of a [[better]] name they may be called) which
heretofore co-existed with and supplemented the [[christian]] ethics,
receiving some of its spirit, and infusing into it some of theirs, there
will result, and is even now resulting, a low, abject, servile type of
character, which, submit itself as it may to what it deems the supreme
will, is incapable of rising to or sympathising in the conception of
supreme goodness. i [[believe]] that other ethics than any which can be
evolved from exclusively [[christian]] sources, must [[exist]] side by side with
christian ethics to [[produce]] the [[moral]] regeneration of [[mankind]]; and that
the [[christian]] [[system]] is no exception to the [[rule]], that in an imperfect
state of the [[human]] [[mind]], the interests of [[truth]] require a [[diversity]] of
opinions. it is not necessary that in ceasing to ignore the [[moral]] truths
not contained in [[christianity]], [[men]] should ignore any of those which it
does contain. such prejudice, or oversight, when it occurs, is
altogether an [[evil]]; but it is one from which we cannot [[hope]] to be always
exempt, and must be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable [[good]].
the exclusive pretension made by a part of the [[truth]] to be the whole,
must and ought to be protested against, and if a reactionary impulse
should make the protestors [[unjust]] in their turn, this one-sidedness,
like the other, may be lamented, but must be tolerated. if christians
would [[teach]] infidels to be just to [[christianity]], they should themselves
be just to infidelity. it can do [[truth]] no service to blink the [[fact]],
known to all who have the most ordinary acquaintance with literary
history, that a large portion of the noblest and most valuable moral
teaching has been the [[work]], not only of [[men]] who did not [[know]], but of men
who knew and rejected, the [[christian]] [[faith]].

i do not pretend that the most unlimited use of the [[freedom]] of
enunciating all possible opinions [[opinion]] would put an end to the evils [[evil]] of
religious or philosophical sectarianism. every [[truth]] which [[men]] of narrow
capacity are in earnest about, is sure to be asserted, inculcated, and
in many ways even acted on, as if no other [[truth]] existed in the [[world]],
or at all events none that could limit or qualify the first. i
acknowledge that the tendency of all opinions [[opinion]] to become sectarian is not
cured by the freest discussion, but is often heightened and exacerbated
thereby; the [[truth]] which ought to have been, but was not, seen, being
rejected all the more violently because proclaimed by persons [[person]] regarded
as opponents. but it is not on the impassioned partisan, it is on the
calmer and more disinterested bystander, that this collision of
opinions works [[work]] its salutary effect. not the [[violent]] conflict between
parts of the [[truth]], but the quiet suppression of half of it, is the
formidable [[evil]]: there is always [[hope]] when [[people]] are forced to listen
to both sides; it is when they attend only to one that errors harden
into prejudices, and [[truth]] itself ceases to have the effect of [[truth]], by
being exaggerated into falsehood. and since there are few mental
attributes more rare than that judicial faculty which can sit in
intelligent [[judgment]] between two sides of a [[question]], of which only one
is represented by an advocate before it, [[truth]] has no [[chance]] but in
proportion as every side of it, every [[opinion]] which embodies any
fraction of the [[truth]], not only finds advocates, but is so advocated as
to be listened to.


we have now recognised the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind
(on which all their other well-being depends) of [[freedom]] of [[opinion]], and
freedom of the expression of [[opinion]], on four distinct grounds; which we
will now briefly recapitulate.

first, if any [[opinion]] is compelled to [[silence]], that [[opinion]] may, for
aught we can certainly [[know]], be true. to deny this is to assume our own
infallibility.

secondly, though the silenced [[opinion]] be an error, it may, and very
commonly does, contain a portion of [[truth]]; and since the general or
prevailing [[opinion]] on any [[subject]] is rarely or never the whole [[truth]], it
is only by the collision of adverse opinions [[opinion]], that the remainder of the
truth has any [[chance]] of being supplied.

thirdly, even if the received [[opinion]] be not only true, but the whole
truth; unless it is [[suffered]] to be, and actually is, vigorously and
earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held
in the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of
its [[rational]] grounds. and not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of
the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and
deprived of its vital effect on the [[character]] and conduct: the dogma
becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for [[good]], but cumbering
the ground, and preventing the [[growth]] of any real and heartfelt
conviction, from [[reason]] or personal [[experience]].

before quitting the [[subject]] of [[freedom]] of [[opinion]], it is fit to take
some notice of those who say, that the [[free]] expression of all opinions
should be permitted, on condition that the manner be temperate, and do
not pass the bounds of [[fair]] discussion. much might be said on the
impossibility of fixing where these supposed bounds are to be placed;
for if the test be offence to those whose [[opinion]] is attacked, i think
experience testifies that this offence is given whenever the attack is
telling and powerful, and that every opponent who pushes them hard, and
whom they find it difficult to [[answer]], appears to them, if he shows any
strong feeling on the [[subject]], an intemperate opponent. but this, though
an important consideration in a practical point of view, merges in a
more fundamental objection. undoubtedly the manner of asserting an
opinion, even though it be a true one, may be very objectionable, and
may justly incur severe censure. but the principal offences of the kind
are such as it is mostly impossible, unless by accidental self-betrayal,
to bring [[home]] to conviction. the gravest of them is, to argue
sophistically, to suppress facts [[fact]] or arguments, to misstate the elements
of the case, or misrepresent the opposite [[opinion]]. but all this, even to
the most aggravated [[degree]], is so continually done in [[perfect]] good
faith, by persons [[person]] who are not considered, and in many other respects [[respect]] may
not deserve to be considered, ignorant or incompetent, that it is rarely
possible on adequate grounds conscientiously to stamp the
misrepresentation as morally culpable; and still less could [[law]] presume
to interfere with this [[kind]] of controversial misconduct. with regard to
what is commonly meant by intemperate discussion, namely invective,
sarcasm, personality, and the like, the denunciation of these weapons
would deserve more sympathy if it were ever proposed to interdict them
equally to both sides; but it is only [[desired]] to restrain the employment
of them against the prevailing [[opinion]]: against the unprevailing they
may not only be used without general disapproval, but will be likely to
obtain for him who uses them the [[praise]] of honest zeal and righteous
indignation. yet whatever mischief arises from their use, is greatest
when they are employed against the comparatively defenceless; and
whatever unfair advantage can be derived by any [[opinion]] from this mode
of asserting it, accrues almost exclusively to received opinions [[opinion]]. the
worst offence of this [[kind]] which can be committed by a polemic, is to
stigmatise those who hold the contrary [[opinion]] as [[bad]] and immoral [[men]].
to calumny of this sort, those who hold any unpopular [[opinion]] are
peculiarly exposed, because they are in general few and uninfluential,
and nobody but themselves [[feel]] much interest in seeing [[justice]] done
them; but this weapon is, from the [[nature]] of the case, denied to those
who attack a prevailing [[opinion]]: they can neither use it with safety to
themselves, nor, if they could, would it do anything but recoil on their
own cause. in general, opinions [[opinion]] contrary to those commonly received can
only obtain a hearing by [[studied]] moderation of [[language]], and the most
cautious avoidance of unnecessary offence, from which they hardly ever
deviate even in a slight [[degree]] without losing ground: while unmeasured
vituperation employed on the side of the prevailing [[opinion]], really does
deter [[people]] from professing contrary opinions [[opinion]], and from listening to
those who profess them. for the interest, therefore, of [[truth]] and
justice, it is far more important to restrain this employment of
vituperative [[language]] than the other; and, for [[example]], if it were
necessary to choose, there would be much more need to discourage
offensive attacks on infidelity, than on [[religion]]. it is, however,
obvious that [[law]] and [[authority]] have no [[business]] with restraining either,
while [[opinion]] ought, in every instance, to determine its verdict by the
circumstances of the [[individual]] case; condemning every one, on whichever
side of the argument he places himself, in whose mode of advocacy either
want of candour, or malignity, bigotry, or intolerance of feeling
manifest themselves; but not inferring these vices [[vice]] from the side which
a [[person]] takes, though it be the contrary side of the [[question]] to our
own: and giving merited [[honour]] to every one, whatever [[opinion]] he may
hold, who has calmness to see and honesty to [[state]] what his opponents
and their opinions [[opinion]] really are, exaggerating nothing to their discredit,
keeping nothing back which tells, or can be supposed to tell, in their
favour. this is the real morality of [[public]] discussion; and if often
violated, i am [[happy]] to [[think]] that there are many controversialists who
to a [[great]] extent observe it, and a still greater number who
conscientiously strive towards it.

footnotes:

[6] these words had scarcely been written, when, as if to give them an
emphatic contradiction, occurred the [[government]] press prosecutions of
1858. that ill-judged interference with the [[liberty]] of [[public]] discussion
has not, however, induced me to alter a [[single]] word in the text, nor has
it at all weakened my conviction that, moments of panic excepted, the
era of pains [[pain]] and penalties for [[political]] discussion has, in our own
country, passed away. for, in the first place, the prosecutions were not
persisted in; and, in the second, they were never, properly speaking,
political prosecutions. the offence charged was not that of criticising
institutions, or the acts or persons [[person]] of rulers, but of circulating what
was deemed an immoral doctrine, the lawfulness of tyrannicide.

if the arguments of the [[present]] [[chapter]] are of any validity, there ought
to [[exist]] the fullest [[liberty]] of professing and discussing, as a matter
of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be
considered. it would, therefore, be irrelevant and out of place to
examine here, whether the doctrine of tyrannicide deserves that title. i
shall content myself with saying, that the [[subject]] has been at all times
one of the open questions [[question]] of morals [[moral]]; that the act of a private citizen
in striking down a [[criminal]], who, by raising himself above the [[law]], has
placed himself beyond the reach of legal [[punishment]] or control, has been
accounted by whole nations, and by some of the [[best]] and wisest of [[men]],
not a crime, but an act of exalted [[virtue]]; and that, [[right]] or [[wrong]], it
is not of the [[nature]] of assassination, but of civil [[war]]. as such, i hold
that the instigation to it, in a specific case, may be a proper subject
of [[punishment]], but only if an overt act has followed, and at least a
probable connection can be established between the act and the
instigation. even then, it is not a [[foreign]] [[government]], but the very
government assailed, which alone, in the exercise of self-defence, can
legitimately punish attacks directed against its own existence.

[10] ample warning may be drawn from the large infusion of the passions
of a persecutor, which mingled with the general display of the worst
parts of our national [[character]] on the [[occasion]] of the sepoy
insurrection. the ravings of fanatics or charlatans from the pulpit may
be unworthy of notice; but the heads of the evangelical party have
announced as their [[principle]], for the [[government]] of hindoos and
mahomedans, that no schools be supported by [[public]] [[money]] in which the
bible is not taught, and by necessary consequence that no public
employment be given to any but real or pretended christians [[christian]]. an
under-secretary of [[state]], in a [[speech]] delivered to his constituents on
the 12th of november, 1857, is reported to have said: "toleration of
their faith" (the [[faith]] of a hundred millions of british subjects), "the
superstition which they called [[religion]], by the british [[government]], had
had the effect of retarding the ascendency of the british name, and
preventing the salutary [[growth]] of [[christianity]].... toleration was the
great corner-stone of the [[religious]] liberties [[liberty]] of this [[country]]; but do
not let them [[abuse]] that precious word toleration. as he understood it,
it meant the complete [[liberty]] to all, [[freedom]] of [[worship]], _among
christians, who worshipped upon the same foundation_. it meant
toleration of all sects and denominations of _christians who believed in
the one mediation_." i [[desire]] to call attention to the [[fact]], that a man
who has been deemed fit to fill a high office in the [[government]] of this
country, under a liberal ministry, maintains the doctrine that all who
do not [[believe]] in the divinity of [[christ]] are beyond the pale of
toleration. who, after this imbecile display, can indulge the illusion
that [[religious]] persecution has passed away, never to return?




chapter iii.

of individuality, as one of the elements of well-being.


such being the reasons [[reason]] which make it imperative that [[human]] beings should
be [[free]] to form opinions [[opinion]], and to express their opinions [[opinion]] without reserve;
and such the baneful consequences to the intellectual, and through that
to the [[moral]] [[nature]] of [[man]], unless this [[liberty]] is either conceded, or
asserted in spite of prohibition; let us next examine whether the same
reasons do not require that [[men]] should be [[free]] to act upon their
opinions--to carry these out in their lives [[life]], without hindrance, either
physical or [[moral]], from their fellow-men, so long as it is at their own
risk and peril. this [[last]] proviso is of course indispensable. no one
pretends that actions should be as [[free]] as opinions [[opinion]]. on the contrary,
even opinions [[opinion]] lose their immunity, when the circumstances in which they
are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a positive
instigation to some mischievous act. an [[opinion]] that corn-dealers are
starvers of the [[poor]], or that private [[property]] is robbery, ought to be
unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but may justly
incur [[punishment]] when delivered orally to an excited mob assembled
before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about among the same
mob in the form of a placard. acts, of whatever [[kind]], which, without
justifiable cause, do harm to others, may be, and in the more important
cases absolutely require to be, controlled by the unfavourable
sentiments, and, when needful, by the active interference of [[mankind]].
the [[liberty]] of the [[individual]] must be thus far limited; he must not make
himself a nuisance to other [[people]]. but if he refrains from molesting
others in what concerns them, and merely acts according to his own
inclination and [[judgment]] in things which concern himself, the same
reasons which show that [[opinion]] should be [[free]], prove also that he
should be allowed, without molestation, to carry his opinions [[opinion]] into
practice at his own cost. that [[mankind]] are not infallible; that their
truths, for the most part, are only half-truths; that unity of [[opinion]],
unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparison of opposite
opinions, is not desirable, and [[diversity]] not an [[evil]], but a [[good]],
until [[mankind]] are much more capable than at [[present]] of recognising all
sides of the [[truth]], are principles [[principle]] applicable to men's modes of action,
not less than to their opinions [[opinion]]. as it is useful that while [[mankind]] are
imperfect there should be different opinions [[opinion]], so is it that there should
be different experiments of living; that [[free]] scope should be given to
varieties of [[character]], short of injury to others; and that the worth of
different modes of [[life]] should be proved practically, when any one
thinks fit to try them. it is desirable, in short, that in things which
do not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself.
where, not the person's own [[character]], but the traditions or customs of
other [[people]] are the [[rule]] of conduct, there is wanting one of the
principal ingredients of [[human]] [[happiness]], and quite the [[chief]] ingredient
of [[individual]] and social [[progress]].

in maintaining this [[principle]], the [[greatest]] difficulty to be encountered
does not [[lie]] in the appreciation of means towards an acknowledged end,
but in the indifference of persons [[person]] in general to the end itself. if it
were [[felt]] that the [[free]] [[development]] of individuality is one of the
leading essentials of well-being; that it is not only a co-ordinate
element with all that is designated by the terms civilisation,
instruction, [[education]], [[culture]], but is itself a necessary part and
condition of all those things; there would be no danger that liberty
should be under-valued, and the adjustment of the boundaries between it
and social control would [[present]] no extraordinary difficulty. but the
evil is, that [[individual]] spontaneity is hardly recognised by the common
modes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving any
regard on its own account. the majority, being satisfied with the ways
of [[mankind]] as they now are (for it is they who make them what they are),
cannot comprehend why those ways should not be [[good]] enough for
everybody; and what is more, spontaneity forms no part of the ideal of
the majority of [[moral]] and social reformers, but is rather looked on with
jealousy, as a troublesome and perhaps rebellious obstruction to the
general acceptance of what these reformers, in their own [[judgment]], think
would be [[best]] for [[mankind]]. few persons [[person]], out of germany, even comprehend
the meaning of the doctrine which wilhelm von humboldt, so eminent both
as a _savant_ and as a politician, made the text of a treatise--that
"the end of [[man]], or that which is prescribed by the eternal or immutable
dictates of [[reason]], and not suggested by vague and transient desires [[desire]],
is the highest and most harmonious [[development]] of his powers [[power]] to a
complete and consistent whole;" that, therefore, the object "towards
which every [[human]] being must ceaselessly direct his efforts, and on
which especially those who design to influence their fellow-men must
ever keep their [[eyes]], is the individuality of [[power]] and [[development]];"
that for this there are two requisites, "freedom, and a variety of
situations;" and that from the union of these arise "individual vigour
and manifold [[diversity]]," which combine themselves in "originality."[11]

little, however, as [[people]] are accustomed to a doctrine like that of von
humboldt, and surprising as it may be to them to find so high a value
attached to individuality, the [[question]], one must nevertheless [[think]],
can only be one of [[degree]]. no one's [[idea]] of excellence in conduct is
that [[people]] should do absolutely nothing but copy one another. no one
would assert that [[people]] ought not to put into their mode of [[life]], and
into the conduct of their concerns, any impress whatever of their own
judgment, or of their own [[individual]] [[character]]. on the other hand, it
would be absurd to pretend that [[people]] ought to [[live]] as if nothing
whatever had been known in the [[world]] before they came into it; as if
experience had as yet done nothing towards showing that one mode of
existence, or of conduct, is preferable to another. nobody denies that
people should be so taught and trained in [[youth]], as to [[know]] and benefit
by the ascertained results of [[human]] [[experience]]. but it is the privilege
and proper condition of a [[human]] being, arrived at the maturity of his
faculties, to use and interpret [[experience]] in his own way. it is for him
to find out what part of recorded [[experience]] is properly applicable to
his own circumstances and [[character]]. the traditions and customs of other
people are, to a [[certain]] extent, evidence of what their [[experience]] has
taught _them_; presumptive evidence, and as such, have a claim to his
deference: but, in the first place, their [[experience]] may be too narrow;
or they may not have interpreted it rightly. secondly, their
interpretation of [[experience]] may be [[correct]], but unsuitable to him.
customs are made for customary circumstances, and customary characters [[character]]:
and his circumstances or his [[character]] may be uncustomary. thirdly,
though the customs be both [[good]] as customs, and suitable to him, yet to
conform to custom, merely _as_ custom, does not educate or develop in
him any of the qualities which are the distinctive endowment of a human
being. the [[human]] faculties of perception, [[judgment]], discriminative
feeling, mental activity, and even [[moral]] preference, are exercised only
in making a [[choice]]. he who does anything because it is the custom, makes
no [[choice]]. he gains no practice either in discerning or in desiring what
is [[best]]. the mental and [[moral]], like the muscular powers [[power]], are improved
only by being used. the faculties are called into no exercise by doing a
thing merely because others do it, no more than by believing a thing
only because others [[believe]] it. if the grounds of an [[opinion]] are not
conclusive to the person's own [[reason]], his [[reason]] cannot be
strengthened, but is likely to be weakened by his adopting it: and if
the inducements to an act are not such as are consentaneous to his own
feelings and [[character]] (where affection, or the rights [[right]] of others, are
not concerned), it is so much done towards rendering his feelings and
character inert and torpid, instead of active and energetic.

he who lets the [[world]], or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life
for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of
imitation. he who chooses his plan for himself, employs all his
faculties. he must use observation to see, reasoning and [[judgment]] to
foresee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to
decide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold to
his deliberate decision. and these qualities he requires and exercises
exactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines
according to his own [[judgment]] and feelings is a large one. it is
possible that he might be guided in some [[good]] path, and kept out of
harm's way, without any of these things. but what will be his
comparative worth as a [[human]] being? it really is of importance, not only
what [[men]] do, but also what manner of [[men]] they are that do it. among the
works of [[man]], which [[human]] [[life]] is rightly employed in perfecting and
beautifying, the first in importance surely is [[man]] himself. supposing it
were possible to get houses built, corn grown, battles [[battle]] fought, causes
tried, and even churches [[church]] erected and prayers said, by machinery--by
automatons in [[human]] form--it would be a considerable loss to exchange
for these automatons even the [[men]] and [[women]] who at [[present]] inhabit the
more civilised parts of the [[world]], and who assuredly are but starved
specimens of what [[nature]] can and will [[produce]]. [[human]] [[nature]] is not a
machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work
prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop
itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces
which make it a living thing.

it will probably be conceded that it is desirable [[people]] should exercise
their understandings, and that an [[intelligent]] following of custom, or
even occasionally an [[intelligent]] deviation from custom, is [[better]] than a
blind and simply mechanical adhesion to it. to a [[certain]] extent it is
admitted, that our understanding should be our own: but there is not the
same willingness to admit that our desires [[desire]] and impulses should be our
own likewise; or that to possess impulses of our own, and of any
strength, is anything but a peril and a snare. yet desires [[desire]] and impulses
are as much a part of a [[perfect]] [[human]] being, as beliefs and restraints:
and [[strong]] impulses are only perilous when not properly balanced; when
one set of aims and inclinations is developed into [[strength]], while
others, which ought to co-exist with them, remain [[weak]] and inactive. it
is not because men's desires [[desire]] are [[strong]] that they act ill; it is because
their consciences are [[weak]]. there is no [[natural]] connection between
strong impulses and a [[weak]] [[conscience]]. the [[natural]] connection is the
other way. to say that one person's desires [[desire]] and feelings are stronger
and more various than those of another, is merely to say that he has
more of the raw material of [[human]] [[nature]], and is therefore capable,
perhaps of more [[evil]], but certainly of more [[good]]. [[strong]] impulses are
but another name for energy. energy may be turned to [[bad]] uses; but more
good may always be made of an energetic [[nature]], than of an indolent and
impassive one. those who have most [[natural]] feeling, are always those
whose cultivated feelings may be made the strongest. the same strong
susceptibilities which make the personal impulses vivid and powerful,
are also the source from whence are generated the most passionate love
of [[virtue]], and the sternest self-control. it is through the cultivation
of these, that [[society]] both does its [[duty]] and protects its interests:
not by rejecting the stuff of which heroes are made, because it knows
not how to make them. a [[person]] whose desires [[desire]] and impulses are his
own--are the expression of his own [[nature]], as it has been developed and
modified by his own culture--is said to have a [[character]]. one whose
desires and impulses are not his own, has no [[character]], no more than a
steam-engine has a [[character]]. if, in addition to being his own, his
impulses are [[strong]], and are under the [[government]] of a [[strong]] will, he
has an energetic [[character]]. whoever thinks [[think]] that individuality of
desires and impulses should not be encouraged to unfold itself, must
maintain that [[society]] has no need of [[strong]] natures--is not the better
for containing many persons [[person]] who have much character--and that a high
general average of energy is not desirable.

in some early states of [[society]], these forces [[force]] might be, and were, too
much ahead of the [[power]] which [[society]] then possessed of disciplining and
controlling them. there has been a [[time]] when the element of spontaneity
and individuality was in excess, and the social [[principle]] had a hard
struggle with it. the difficulty then was, to induce [[men]] of strong
bodies or minds [[mind]] to [[pay]] [[obedience]] to any rules [[rule]] which required them to
control their impulses. to overcome this difficulty, [[law]] and discipline,
like the popes struggling against the emperors [[emperor]], asserted a [[power]] over
the whole [[man]], claiming to control all his [[life]] in order to control his
character--which [[society]] had not found any other sufficient means of
binding. but [[society]] has now fairly got the [[better]] of individuality; and
the danger which threatens [[human]] [[nature]] is not the excess, but the
deficiency, of personal impulses and preferences. things are vastly
changed, since the [[passions]] of those who were [[strong]] by station or by
personal endowment were in a [[state]] of habitual rebellion against laws
and ordinances, and required to be rigorously chained up to enable the
persons within their reach to enjoy any particle of security. in our
times, from the highest class of [[society]] down to the lowest, every one
lives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship. not only in
what concerns others, but in what concerns only themselves, the
individual, or the [[family]], do not ask themselves--what do i prefer? or,
what would suit my [[character]] and disposition? or, what would allow the
best and highest in me to have fair-play, and enable it to grow and
thrive? they ask themselves, what is suitable to my position? what is
usually done by persons [[person]] of my station and pecuniary circumstances? or
(worse still) what is usually done by persons [[person]] of a station and
circumstances superior to mine? i do not mean that they choose what is
customary, in preference to what suits their own inclination. it does
not occur to them to have any inclination, except for what is customary.
thus the [[mind]] itself is bowed to the yoke: even in what [[people]] do for
pleasure, conformity is the first thing [[thought]] of; they [[live]] in crowds;
they exercise [[choice]] only among things commonly done: peculiarity of
taste, eccentricity of conduct, are shunned equally with crimes: until
by dint of not following their own [[nature]], they have no [[nature]] to
follow: their [[human]] capacities are withered and starved: they become
incapable of any [[strong]] wishes [[wish]] or native pleasures [[pleasure]], and are generally
without either opinions [[opinion]] or feelings of [[home]] [[growth]], or properly their
own. now is this, or is it not, the desirable condition of [[human]] [[nature]]?

it is so, on the calvinistic theory. according to that, the one great
offence of [[man]] is self-will. all the [[good]] of which [[humanity]] is capable,
is comprised in [[obedience]]. you have no [[choice]]; thus you must do, and no
otherwise: "whatever is not a [[duty]], is a [[sin]]." [[human]] [[nature]] being
radically [[corrupt]], there is no redemption for any one until [[human]] nature
is killed within him. to one holding this theory of [[life]], crushing out
any of the [[human]] faculties, capacities, and susceptibilities, is no
evil: [[man]] needs no capacity, but that of surrendering himself to the
will of [[god]]: and if he uses any of his faculties for any other purpose
but to do that supposed will more effectually, he is [[better]] without
them. that is the theory of calvinism; and it is held, in a mitigated
form, by many who do not consider themselves calvinists; the mitigation
consisting in giving a less ascetic interpretation to the alleged will
of [[god]]; asserting it to be his will that [[mankind]] should gratify some of
their inclinations; of course not in the manner they themselves prefer,
but in the way of [[obedience]], that is, in a way prescribed to them by
authority; and, therefore, by the necessary conditions of the case, the
same for all.

in some such insidious form there is at [[present]] a [[strong]] tendency to
this narrow theory of [[life]], and to the pinched and hidebound type of
human [[character]] which it patronises. many persons [[person]], no [[doubt]], sincerely
think that [[human]] beings thus cramped and dwarfed, are as their maker
designed them to be; just as many have [[thought]] that trees are a much
finer thing when clipped into pollards, or cut out into figures of
animals, than as [[nature]] made them. but if it be any part of [[religion]] to
believe that [[man]] was made by a [[good]] being, it is more consistent with
that [[faith]] to [[believe]], that this being gave all [[human]] faculties that
they might be cultivated and unfolded, not rooted out and consumed, and
that he takes delight in every nearer approach made by his creatures to
the ideal conception embodied in them, every increase in any of their
capabilities of comprehension, of action, or of enjoyment. there is a
different type of [[human]] excellence from the calvinistic; a conception of
humanity as having its [[nature]] bestowed on it for other purposes [[purpose]] than
merely to be abnegated. "pagan self-assertion" is one of the elements of
human worth, as well as "christian self-denial."[12] there is a greek
ideal of self-development, which the platonic and [[christian]] ideal of
self-government blends with, but does not supersede. it may be [[better]] to
be a john knox than an alcibiades, but it is [[better]] to be a pericles
than either; nor would a pericles, if we had one in these days, be
without anything [[good]] which belonged to john knox.

it is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is [[individual]] in
themselves, but by cultivating it and calling it forth, within the
limits imposed by the rights [[right]] and interests of others, that [[human]] beings
become a [[noble]] and beautiful object of contemplation; and as the works
partake the [[character]] of those who do them, by the same process human
life also becomes [[rich]], diversified, and animating, furnishing more
abundant aliment to high thoughts [[thought]] and elevating feelings, and
strengthening the tie which binds every [[individual]] to the [[race]], by
making the [[race]] infinitely [[better]] worth belonging to. in proportion to
the [[development]] of his individuality, each [[person]] becomes more valuable
to himself, and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others.
there is a greater fulness of [[life]] about his own existence, and when
there is more [[life]] in the units there is more in the mass which is
composed of them. as much compression as is necessary to prevent the
stronger specimens of [[human]] [[nature]] from encroaching on the rights [[right]] of
others, cannot be dispensed with; but for this there is ample
compensation even in the point of view of [[human]] [[development]]. the means
of [[development]] which the [[individual]] loses by being prevented from
gratifying his inclinations to the injury of others, are chiefly
obtained at the expense of the [[development]] of other [[people]]. and even to
himself there is a full equivalent in the [[better]] [[development]] of the
social part of his [[nature]], rendered possible by the restraint put upon
the selfish part. to be held to rigid rules [[rule]] of [[justice]] for the sake of
others, develops the feelings and capacities which have the [[good]] of
others for their object. but to be restrained in things not affecting
their [[good]], by their mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable, except
such [[force]] of [[character]] as may unfold itself in resisting the restraint.
if acquiesced in, it dulls and blunts the whole [[nature]]. to give any
fair-play to the [[nature]] of each, it is essential that different persons
should be allowed to lead different lives [[life]]. in proportion as this
latitude has been exercised in any [[age]], has that [[age]] been noteworthy to
posterity. even despotism does not [[produce]] its worst effects, so long as
individuality exists under it; and whatever crushes individuality is
despotism, by whatever name it may be called, and whether it professes
to be enforcing the will of [[god]] or the injunctions of [[men]].

having said that individuality is the same thing with [[development]], and
that it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces [[produce]], or can
produce, well-developed [[human]] beings, i might here close the argument:
for what more or [[better]] can be said of any condition of [[human]] affairs,
than that it brings [[human]] beings themselves nearer to the [[best]] thing
they can be? or what worse can be said of any obstruction to [[good]], than
that it prevents this? doubtless, however, these considerations will not
suffice to convince those who most need convincing; and it is necessary
further to show, that these developed [[human]] beings are of some use to
the undeveloped--to point out to those who do not [[desire]] [[liberty]], and
would not avail themselves of it, that they may be in some intelligible
manner rewarded for allowing other [[people]] to make use of it without
hindrance.

in the first place, then, i would suggest that they might possibly
learn something from them. it will not be denied by anybody, that
originality is a valuable element in [[human]] affairs. there is always need
of persons [[person]] not only to discover new truths [[truth]], and point out when what were
once truths [[truth]] are true no longer, but also to commence new practices, and
set the [[example]] of more enlightened conduct, and [[better]] taste and sense
in [[human]] [[life]]. this cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who does not
believe that the [[world]] has already attained [[perfection]] in all its ways
and practices. it is true that this benefit is not capable of being
rendered by everybody alike: there are but few persons [[person]], in comparison
with the whole of [[mankind]], whose experiments, if adopted by others,
would be likely to be any improvement on established practice. but these
few are the salt of the [[earth]]; without them, [[human]] [[life]] would become a
stagnant pool. not only is it they who introduce [[good]] things which did
not before [[exist]]; it is they who keep the [[life]] in those which already
existed. if there were nothing new to be done, would [[human]] intellect
cease to be necessary? would it be a [[reason]] why those who do the old
things should forget why they are done, and do them like cattle, not
like [[human]] beings? there is only too [[great]] a tendency in the best
beliefs and practices to degenerate into the mechanical; and unless
there were a succession of persons [[person]] whose ever-recurring originality
prevents the grounds of those beliefs and practices from becoming merely
traditional, such [[dead]] matter would not resist the smallest shock from
anything really alive, and there would be no [[reason]] why civilisation
should not [[die]] out, as in the byzantine [[empire]]. persons [[person]] of genius, it is
true, are, and are always likely to be, a small minority; but in order
to have them, it is necessary to preserve the soil in which they grow.
genius can only breathe freely in an _atmosphere_ of [[freedom]]. persons [[person]] of
genius are, _ex vi termini_, _more_ [[individual]] than any other
people--less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, without
hurtful compression, into any of the small number of moulds which
society provides in order to save its members the trouble of forming
their own [[character]]. if from timidity they [[consent]] to be forced into one
of these moulds, and to let all that part of themselves which cannot
expand under the pressure remain unexpanded, [[society]] will be little the
better for their genius. if they are of a [[strong]] [[character]], and break
their fetters, they become a mark for the [[society]] which has not
succeeded in reducing them to commonplace, to point at with solemn
warning as "wild," "erratic," and the like; much as if one should
complain of the niagara river for not flowing smoothly between its banks
like a dutch canal.

i insist thus emphatically on the importance of genius, and the
necessity of allowing it to unfold itself freely both in [[thought]] and in
practice, being well aware that no one will deny the position in theory,
but knowing also that almost every one, in reality, is totally
indifferent to it. [[people]] [[think]] genius a fine thing if it enables a man
to write an exciting poem, or paint a picture. but in its true sense,
that of originality in [[thought]] and action, though no one says that it is
not a thing to be admired, nearly all, at [[heart]], [[think]] that they can do
very well without it. unhappily this is too [[natural]] to be wondered at.
originality is the one thing which unoriginal minds [[mind]] cannot [[feel]] the use
of. they cannot see what it is to do for them: how should they? if they
could see what it would do for them, it would not be originality. the
first service which originality has to render them, is that of opening
their [[eyes]]: which being once fully done, they would have a [[chance]] of
being themselves original. meanwhile, recollecting that nothing was ever
yet done which some one was not the first to do, and that all good
things which [[exist]] are the fruits of originality, let them be modest
enough to [[believe]] that there is something still left for it to
accomplish, and assure themselves that they are more in need of
originality, the less they are conscious of the want.

in sober [[truth]], whatever homage may be professed, or even paid, to real
or supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of things
throughout the [[world]] is to render mediocrity the ascendant [[power]] among
mankind. in ancient [[history]], in the middle ages [[age]], and in a diminishing
degree through the long transition from feudality to the [[present]] [[time]],
the [[individual]] was a [[power]] in himself; and if he had either great
talents or a high social position, he was a considerable [[power]]. at
present individuals [[individual]] are lost in the crowd. in [[politics]] it is almost a
triviality to say that [[public]] [[opinion]] now rules [[rule]] the [[world]]. the only
power deserving the name is that of masses, and of governments [[government]] while
they make themselves the organ of the tendencies and instincts of
masses. this is as true in the [[moral]] and social relations of private
life as in [[public]] transactions. those whose opinions [[opinion]] go by the name of
public [[opinion]], are not always the same sort of [[public]]: in [[america]] they
are the whole [[white]] [[population]]; in [[england]], chiefly the middle class.
but they are always a mass, that is to say, collective mediocrity. and
what is a still greater novelty, the mass do not now take their opinions
from dignitaries in [[church]] or [[state]], from ostensible leaders, or from
books. their thinking is done for them by [[men]] much like themselves,
addressing them or speaking in their name, on the spur of the moment,
through the newspapers. i am not complaining of all this. i do not
assert that anything [[better]] is compatible, as a general [[rule]], with the
present low [[state]] of the [[human]] [[mind]]. but that does not hinder the
government of mediocrity from being mediocre [[government]]. no government
by a [[democracy]] or a numerous [[aristocracy]], either in its [[political]] acts
or in the opinions [[opinion]], qualities, and tone of [[mind]] which it fosters, ever
did or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the sovereign
many have let themselves be guided (which in their [[best]] times [[time]] they
always have done) by the counsels and influence of a more highly gifted
and instructed one or few. the initiation of all [[wise]] or [[noble]] things,
comes and must come from individuals [[individual]]; generally at first from some one
individual. the [[honour]] and [[glory]] of the average [[man]] is that he is
capable of following that initiative; that he can respond internally to
wise and [[noble]] things, and be [[led]] to them with his [[eyes]] open. i am not
countenancing the sort of "hero-worship" which applauds the [[strong]] man
of genius for forcibly seizing on the [[government]] of the [[world]] and making
it do his bidding in spite of itself. all he can claim is, [[freedom]] to
point out the way. the [[power]] of compelling others into it, is not only
inconsistent with the [[freedom]] and [[development]] of all the rest, but
corrupting to the [[strong]] [[man]] himself. it does seem, however, that when
the opinions [[opinion]] of masses of merely average [[men]] are everywhere become or
becoming the dominant [[power]], the counterpoise and corrective to that
tendency would be, the more and more pronounced individuality of those
who stand on the higher eminences of [[thought]]. it is in these
circumstances most especially, that exceptional individuals [[individual]], instead of
being deterred, should be encouraged in acting differently from the
mass. in other times [[time]] there was no advantage in their doing so, unless
they acted not only differently, but [[better]]. in this [[age]] the mere
example of nonconformity, the mere refusal to bend the knee to custom,
is itself a service. precisely because the [[tyranny]] of [[opinion]] is such as
to make eccentricity a reproach, it is desirable, in order to break
through that [[tyranny]], that [[people]] should be eccentric. eccentricity has
always abounded when and where [[strength]] of [[character]] has abounded; and
the amount of eccentricity in a [[society]] has generally been proportional
to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and [[moral]] [[courage]] which it
contained. that so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the [[chief]] danger
of the [[time]].

i have said that it is important to give the freest scope possible to
uncustomary things, in order that it may in [[time]] appear which of these
are fit to be converted into customs. but independence of action, and
disregard of custom are not solely deserving of encouragement for the
chance they afford that [[better]] modes of action, and customs more worthy
of general adoption, may be struck out; nor is it only persons [[person]] of
decided mental superiority who have a just claim to carry on their lives
in their own way. there is no [[reason]] that all [[human]] existences should be
constructed on some one, or some small number of patterns. if a person
possesses any tolerable amount of common-sense and [[experience]], his own
mode of laying out his existence is the [[best]], not because it is the best
in itself, but because it is his own mode. [[human]] beings are not like
sheep; and even sheep are not undistinguishably alike. a [[man]] cannot get
a coat or a pair of boots to fit him, unless they are either made to his
measure, or he has a whole warehouseful to choose from: and is it easier
to fit him with a [[life]] than with a coat, or are [[human]] beings more like
one another in their whole physical and [[spiritual]] conformation than in
the shape of their feet? if it were only that [[people]] have diversities of
taste, that is [[reason]] enough for not attempting to shape them all after
one model. but different persons [[person]] also require different conditions for
their [[spiritual]] [[development]]; and can no more [[exist]] healthily in the same
moral, than all the variety of plants can in the same physical,
atmosphere and [[climate]]. the same things which are helps to one person
towards the cultivation of his higher [[nature]], are hindrances to another.
the same mode of [[life]] is a healthy excitement to one, keeping all his
faculties of action and enjoyment in their [[best]] order, while to another
it is a distracting burthen, which suspends or crushes all internal
life. such are the differences among [[human]] beings in their sources of
pleasure, their susceptibilities of [[pain]], and the operation on them of
different physical and [[moral]] agencies, that unless there is a
corresponding [[diversity]] in their modes of [[life]], they neither obtain
their [[fair]] share of [[happiness]], nor grow up to the mental, [[moral]], and
aesthetic stature of which their [[nature]] is capable. why then should
tolerance, as far as the [[public]] sentiment is concerned, extend only to
tastes and modes of [[life]] which extort acquiescence by the multitude of
their adherents? nowhere (except in some monastic institutions) is
diversity of taste entirely unrecognised; a [[person]] may, without blame,
either like or dislike rowing, or smoking, or [[music]], or athletic
exercises, or chess, or cards, or study, because both those who like
each of these things, and those who dislike them, are too numerous to be
put down. but the [[man]], and still more the woman, who can be accused
either of doing "what nobody does," or of not doing "what everybody
does," is the [[subject]] of as much depreciatory remark as if he or she had
committed some grave [[moral]] delinquency. persons [[person]] require to possess a
title, or some other badge of rank, or of the consideration of [[people]] of
rank, to be able to indulge somewhat in the luxury of doing as they like
without detriment to their estimation. to indulge somewhat, i repeat:
for whoever allow themselves much of that indulgence, incur the risk of
something worse than disparaging speeches--they are in peril of a
commission _de lunatico_, and of having their [[property]] taken from them
and given to their relations.[13]

there is one characteristic of the [[present]] direction of [[public]] [[opinion]],
peculiarly calculated to make it intolerant of any marked demonstration
of individuality. the general average of [[mankind]] are not only moderate
in [[intellect]], but also moderate in inclinations: they have no tastes or
wishes [[strong]] enough to incline them to do anything unusual, and they
consequently do not [[understand]] those who have, and class all such with
the wild and intemperate whom they are accustomed to look down upon.
now, in addition to this [[fact]] which is general, we have only to suppose
that a [[strong]] movement has set in towards the improvement of morals [[moral]],
and it is evident what we have to expect. in these days such a movement
has set in; much has actually been effected in the way of increased
regularity of conduct, and discouragement of excesses; and there is a
philanthropic spirit abroad, for the exercise of which there is no more
inviting field than the [[moral]] and prudential improvement of our
fellow-creatures. these tendencies of the times [[time]] cause the [[public]] to be
more disposed than at most former periods to prescribe general rules [[rule]] of
conduct, and endeavour to make every one conform to the approved
standard. and that standard, express or tacit, is to [[desire]] nothing
strongly. its ideal of [[character]] is to be without any marked [[character]];
to maim by compression, like a chinese lady's foot, every part of human
nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make the person
markedly dissimilar in outline to commonplace [[humanity]].

as is usually the case with ideals which exclude one-half of what is
desirable, the [[present]] standard of approbation produces [[produce]] only an inferior
imitation of the other half. instead of [[great]] energies guided by
vigorous [[reason]], and [[strong]] feelings strongly controlled by a
conscientious will, its result is [[weak]] feelings and [[weak]] energies, which
therefore can be kept in outward conformity to [[rule]] without any strength
either of will or of [[reason]]. already energetic characters [[character]] on any large
scale are becoming merely traditional. there is now scarcely any outlet
for energy in this [[country]] except [[business]]. the energy expended in that
may still be regarded as considerable. what little is left from that
employment, is expended on some hobby; which may be a useful, even a
philanthropic hobby, but is always some one thing, and generally a thing
of small dimensions. the greatness of [[england]] is now all collective:
individually small, we only appear capable of anything [[great]] by our
habit of combining; and with this our [[moral]] and religious
philanthropists are perfectly contented. but it was [[men]] of another
stamp than this that made [[england]] what it has been; and [[men]] of another
stamp will be needed to prevent its decline.

the despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to human
advancement, being in unceasing antagonism to that disposition to aim at
something [[better]] than customary, which is called, according to
circumstances, the spirit of [[liberty]], or that of [[progress]] or
improvement. the spirit of improvement is not always a spirit of
liberty, for it may aim at forcing improvements on an unwilling [[people]];
and the spirit of [[liberty]], in so far as it resists such attempts, may
ally itself locally and temporarily with the opponents of improvement;
but the only unfailing and permanent source of improvement is [[liberty]],
since by it there are as many possible independent centres of
improvement as there are individuals [[individual]]. the progressive [[principle]],
however, in either shape, whether as the [[love]] of [[liberty]] or of
improvement, is antagonistic to the sway of custom, involving at least
emancipation from that yoke; and the contest between the two constitutes
the [[chief]] interest of the [[history]] of [[mankind]]. the greater part of the
world has, properly speaking, no [[history]], because the despotism of
custom is complete. this is the case over the whole east. custom is
there, in all things, the final appeal; [[justice]] and [[right]] mean
conformity to custom; the argument of custom no one, unless some tyrant
intoxicated with [[power]], thinks [[think]] of resisting. and we see the result.
those nations must once have had originality; they did not start out of
the ground populous, lettered, and versed in many of the [[arts]] of [[life]];
they made themselves all this, and were then the [[greatest]] and most
powerful nations in the [[world]]. what are they now? the subjects [[subject]] or
dependants of tribes whose forefathers wandered in the forests when
theirs had magnificent palaces and gorgeous temples, but over whom
custom exercised only a divided [[rule]] with [[liberty]] and [[progress]]. a
people, it appears, may be progressive for a [[certain]] length of [[time]], and
then stop: when does it stop? when it ceases to possess individuality.
if a similar [[change]] should befall the nations of [[europe]], it will not be
in exactly the same shape: the despotism of custom with which these
nations are threatened is not precisely stationariness. it proscribes
singularity, but it does not preclude [[change]], provided all change
together. we have discarded the fixed costumes of our forefathers; every
one must still dress like other [[people]], but the [[fashion]] may [[change]] once
or twice a year. we thus take [[care]] that when there is [[change]], it shall
be for change's sake, and not from any [[idea]] of [[beauty]] or convenience;
for the same [[idea]] of [[beauty]] or convenience would not strike all the
world at the same moment, and be simultaneously thrown aside by all at
another moment. but we are progressive as well as changeable: we
continually make new inventions in mechanical things, and keep them
until they are again superseded by [[better]]; we are eager for improvement
in [[politics]], in [[education]], even in morals [[moral]], though in this [[last]] our idea
of improvement chiefly consists in persuading or forcing other [[people]] to
be as [[good]] as ourselves. it is not [[progress]] that we object to; on the
contrary, we flatter ourselves that we are the most progressive people
who ever lived. it is individuality that we [[war]] against: we should think
we had done wonders if we had made ourselves all alike; forgetting that
the unlikeness of one [[person]] to another is generally the first thing
which draws the attention of either to the imperfection of his own type,
and the superiority of another, or the possibility, by combining the
advantages of both, of producing something [[better]] than either. we have a
warning [[example]] in china--a nation of much talent, and, in some
respects, even [[wisdom]], owing to the rare [[good]] [[fortune]] of having been
provided at an early period with a particularly [[good]] set of customs, the
work, in some measure, of [[men]] to whom even the most enlightened european
must accord, under [[certain]] limitations, the title of sages and
philosophers. they are remarkable, too, in the excellence of their
apparatus for impressing, as far as possible, the [[best]] [[wisdom]] they
possess upon every [[mind]] in the [[community]], and securing that those who
have appropriated most of it shall occupy the posts of [[honour]] and [[power]].
surely the [[people]] who did this have discovered the secret of human
progressiveness, and must have kept themselves steadily at the head of
the movement of the [[world]]. on the contrary, they have become
stationary--have remained so for thousands of years; and if they are
ever to be farther improved, it must be by foreigners. they have
succeeded beyond all [[hope]] in what english philanthropists are so
industriously working at--in making a [[people]] all alike, all governing
their thoughts [[thought]] and conduct by the same maxims [[maxim]] and rules [[rule]]; and these are
the fruits. the [[modern]] _régime_ of [[public]] [[opinion]] is, in an unorganised
form, what the chinese educational and [[political]] systems [[system]] are in an
organised; and unless individuality shall be able successfully to assert
itself against this yoke, [[europe]], notwithstanding its [[noble]] antecedents
and its professed [[christianity]], will tend to become another [[china]].

what is it that has hitherto preserved [[europe]] from this lot? what has
made the [[european]] [[family]] of nations an improving, instead of a
stationary portion of [[mankind]]? not any superior excellence in them,
which, when it exists, exists as the effect, not as the cause; but their
remarkable [[diversity]] of [[character]] and [[culture]]. individuals [[individual]], classes,
nations, have been extremely unlike one another: they have struck out a
great variety of paths, each leading to something valuable; and although
at every period those who travelled in different paths have been
intolerant of one another, and each would have [[thought]] it an excellent
thing if all the rest could have been compelled to travel his road,
their attempts to thwart each other's [[development]] have rarely had any
permanent [[success]], and each has in [[time]] endured to receive the good
which the others have offered. [[europe]] is, in my [[judgment]], wholly
indebted to this plurality of paths for its progressive and many-sided
development. but it already begins to possess this benefit in a
considerably less [[degree]]. it is decidedly advancing towards the chinese
ideal of making all [[people]] alike. m. de tocqueville, in his last
important [[work]], remarks how much more the frenchmen of the [[present]] day
resemble one another, than did those even of the [[last]] [[generation]]. the
same remark might be made of englishmen in a far greater [[degree]]. in a
passage already quoted from wilhelm von humboldt, he points out two
things as necessary conditions of [[human]] [[development]], because necessary
to render [[people]] unlike one another; namely, [[freedom]], and variety of
situations. the second of these two conditions is in this [[country]] every
day diminishing. the circumstances which surround different classes and
individuals, and shape their characters [[character]], are daily becoming more
assimilated. formerly, different ranks, different neighbourhoods,
different trades [[trade]] and professions, lived in what might be called
different worlds [[world]]; at [[present]], to a [[great]] [[degree]] in the same.
comparatively speaking, they now [[read]] the same things, listen to the
same things, see the same things, go to the same places, have their
hopes and fears [[fear]] directed to the same objects, have the same rights [[right]] and
liberties, and the same means of asserting them. [[great]] as are the
differences of position which remain, they are nothing to those which
have ceased. and the assimilation is still proceeding. all the political
changes of the [[age]] promote it, since they all tend to raise the low and
to lower the high. every extension of [[education]] promotes it, because
education brings [[people]] under [[common]] influences, and gives them access
to the general stock of facts [[fact]] and sentiments. improvements in the means
of communication promote it, by bringing the inhabitants of distant
places into personal contact, and keeping up a rapid flow of changes [[change]] of
residence between one place and another. the increase of commerce and
manufactures promotes it, by diffusing more widely the advantages of
easy circumstances, and opening all objects of [[ambition]], even the
highest, to general competition, whereby the [[desire]] of rising becomes no
longer the [[character]] of a particular class, but of all classes. a more
powerful agency than even all these, in bringing about a general
similarity among [[mankind]], is the complete establishment, in this and
other [[free]] countries [[country]], of the ascendency of [[public]] [[opinion]] in the [[state]].
as the various social eminences which enabled persons [[person]] entrenched on them
to disregard the [[opinion]] of the multitude, gradually become levelled; as
the very [[idea]] of resisting the will of the [[public]], when it is positively
known that they have a will, disappears more and more from the minds [[mind]] of
practical politicians; there ceases to be any social support for
non-conformity--any substantive [[power]] in [[society]], which, itself opposed
to the ascendency of numbers, is interested in taking under its
protection opinions [[opinion]] and tendencies at variance with those of the [[public]].

the combination of all these causes forms so [[great]] a mass of influences
hostile to individuality, that it is not easy to see how it can stand
its ground. it will do so with increasing difficulty, unless the
intelligent part of the [[public]] can be made to [[feel]] its value--to see
that it is [[good]] there should be differences, even though not for the
better, even though, as it may appear to them, some should be for the
worse. if the claims of individuality are ever to be asserted, the time
is now, while much is still wanting to complete the enforced
assimilation. it is only in the earlier stages that any stand can be
successfully made against the encroachment. the demand that all other
people shall resemble ourselves, grows by what it feeds on. if
resistance waits till [[life]] is reduced _nearly_ to one uniform type, all
deviations from that type will come to be considered impious, immoral,
even monstrous and contrary to [[nature]]. [[mankind]] speedily become unable to
conceive [[diversity]], when they have been for some [[time]] unaccustomed to
see it.

[13] there is something both contemptible and frightful in the sort of
evidence on which, of late years, any [[person]] can be judicially declared
unfit for the management of his affairs; and after his [[death]], his
disposal of his [[property]] can be set aside, if there is enough of it to
pay the expenses of litigation--which are charged on the property
itself. all the minute details of his daily [[life]] are pried into, and
whatever is found which, seen through the medium of the perceiving and
describing faculties of the lowest of the low, bears an appearance
unlike absolute commonplace, is laid before the jury as evidence of
insanity, and often with [[success]]; the jurors being little, if at all,
less vulgar and ignorant than the witnesses; while the judges [[judge]], with that
extraordinary want of [[knowledge]] of [[human]] [[nature]] and [[life]] which

value on individuality--so far from respecting the rights [[right]] of each
individual to act, in things indifferent, as seems [[good]] to his own
judgment and inclinations, judges [[judge]] and juries cannot even conceive that a

when it was proposed to burn atheists, charitable [[people]] used to suggest
putting them in a madhouse instead: it would be nothing surprising
nowadays were we to see this done, and the doers applauding themselves,

and [[christian]] a mode of treating these unfortunates, not without a
silent satisfaction at their having thereby obtained their deserts.




chapter iv.

of the limits to the [[authority]] of [[society]] over the [[individual]].


what, then, is the rightful limit to the sovereignty of the individual
over himself? where does the [[authority]] of [[society]] begin? how much of
human [[life]] should be assigned to individuality, and how much to [[society]]?

each will receive its proper share, if each has that which more
particularly concerns it. to individuality should belong the part of
life in which it is chiefly the [[individual]] that is interested; to
society, the part which chiefly interests [[society]].

though [[society]] is not founded on a contract, and though no [[good]] purpose
is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social
obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society
owes a return for the benefit, and the [[fact]] of living in [[society]] renders
it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a [[certain]] line of
conduct towards the rest. this conduct consists, first, in not injuring
the interests of one another; or rather [[certain]] interests which, either
by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be
considered as rights [[right]]; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share
(to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours [[labour]] and sacrifices
incurred for defending the [[society]] or its members from injury and
molestation. these conditions [[society]] is justified in enforcing, at all
costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment. nor is this all
that [[society]] may do. the acts of an [[individual]] may be hurtful to others,
or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the
length of violating any of their constituted rights [[right]]. the offender may
then be justly punished by [[opinion]] though not by [[law]]. as soon as any
part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of
others, [[society]] has jurisdiction over it, and the [[question]] whether the
general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it,
becomes open to discussion. but there is no room for entertaining any
such [[question]] when a person's conduct affects the interests of no
persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like (all
the persons [[person]] concerned being of full [[age]], and the ordinary amount of
understanding). in all such cases there should be [[perfect]] [[freedom]], legal
and social, to do the action and stand the consequences.

it would be a [[great]] misunderstanding of this doctrine, to suppose that
it is one of selfish indifference, which pretends that [[human]] beings have
no [[business]] with each other's conduct in [[life]], and that they should not
concern themselves about the well-doing or well-being of one another,
unless their own interest is involved. instead of any diminution, there
is need of a [[great]] increase of disinterested exertion to promote the
good of others. but disinterested benevolence can find other instruments
to persuade [[people]] to their [[good]], than whips and scourges, either of the
literal or the metaphorical sort. i am the [[last]] [[person]] to undervalue the
self-regarding virtues [[virtue]]; they are only second in importance, if even
second, to the social. it is equally the [[business]] of [[education]] to
cultivate both. but even [[education]] works [[work]] by conviction and persuasion as
well as by compulsion, and it is by the former only that, when the
period of [[education]] is [[past]], the self-regarding virtues [[virtue]] should be
inculcated. [[human]] beings owe to each other [[help]] to distinguish the
better from the worse, and encouragement to choose the former and avoid
the latter. they should be for ever stimulating each other to increased
exercise of their higher faculties, and increased direction of their
feelings and aims towards [[wise]] instead of foolish, elevating instead of
degrading, objects and contemplations. but neither one [[person]], nor any
number of persons [[person]], is warranted in saying to another [[human]] creature of
ripe years, that he shall not do with his [[life]] for his own benefit what
he chooses to do with it. he is the [[person]] most interested in his own
well-being: the interest which any other [[person]], except in cases of
strong personal attachment, can have in it, is trifling, compared with
that which he himself has; the interest which [[society]] has in him
individually (except as to his conduct to others) is fractional, and
altogether indirect: while, with [[respect]] to his own feelings and
circumstances, the most ordinary [[man]] or woman has means of knowledge
immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else. the
interference of [[society]] to overrule his [[judgment]] and purposes [[purpose]] in what
only regards himself, must be grounded on general presumptions; which
may be altogether [[wrong]], and even if [[right]], are as likely as not to be
misapplied to [[individual]] cases, by persons [[person]] no [[better]] acquainted with the
circumstances of such cases than those are who look at them merely from
without. in this department, therefore, of [[human]] affairs, individuality
has its proper field of action. in the conduct of [[human]] beings towards
one another, it is necessary that general rules [[rule]] should for the most part
be observed, in order that [[people]] may [[know]] what they have to expect; but
in each person's own concerns, his [[individual]] spontaneity is entitled to
free exercise. considerations to aid his [[judgment]], exhortations to
strengthen his will, may be offered to him, even obtruded on him, by
others; but he himself is the final [[judge]]. all errors which he is likely
to commit against [[advice]] and warning, are far outweighed by the [[evil]] of
allowing others to constrain him to what they deem his [[good]].

i do not mean that the feelings with which a [[person]] is regarded by
others, ought not to be in any way affected by his self-regarding
qualities or deficiencies. this is neither possible nor desirable. if he
is eminent in any of the qualities which conduce to his own [[good]], he is,
so far, a proper object of admiration. he is so much the nearer to the
ideal [[perfection]] of [[human]] [[nature]]. if he is grossly deficient in those
qualities, a sentiment the opposite of admiration will [[follow]]. there is
a [[degree]] of folly, and a [[degree]] of what may be called (though the
phrase is not unobjectionable) lowness or depravation of taste, which,
though it cannot justify doing harm to the [[person]] who manifests it,
renders him necessarily and properly a [[subject]] of distaste, or, in
extreme cases, even of contempt: a [[person]] could not have the opposite
qualities in due [[strength]] without entertaining these feelings. though
doing no [[wrong]] to any one, a [[person]] may so act as to compel us to judge
him, and [[feel]] to him, as a [[fool]], or as a being of an inferior order: and
since this [[judgment]] and feeling are a [[fact]] which he would prefer to
avoid, it is doing him a service to warn him of it beforehand, as of any
other disagreeable consequence to which he exposes himself. it would be
well, indeed, if this [[good]] office were much more freely rendered than
the [[common]] notions of politeness at [[present]] permit, and if one person
could honestly point out to another that he thinks [[think]] him in [[fault]], without
being considered unmannerly or presuming. we have a [[right]], also, in
various ways, to act upon our unfavourable [[opinion]] of any one, not to
the oppression of his individuality, but in the exercise of ours. we are
not bound, for [[example]], to seek his [[society]]; we have a [[right]] to avoid it
(though not to parade the avoidance), for we have a [[right]] to choose the
society most acceptable to us. we have a [[right]], and it may be our [[duty]],
to caution others against him, if we [[think]] his [[example]] or conversation
likely to have a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates. we
may give others a preference over him in optional [[good]] offices, except
those which tend to his improvement. in these various modes a [[person]] may
suffer very severe penalties at the hands of others, for faults [[fault]] which
directly concern only himself; but he suffers these penalties only in so
far as they are the [[natural]], and, as it were, the spontaneous
consequences of the faults [[fault]] themselves, not because they are purposely
inflicted on him for the sake of [[punishment]]. a [[person]] who shows
rashness, obstinacy, self-conceit--who cannot [[live]] within moderate
means--who cannot restrain himself from hurtful indulgences--who pursues
animal pleasures [[pleasure]] at the expense of those of feeling and intellect--must
expect to be lowered in the [[opinion]] of others, and to have a less share
of their favourable sentiments; but of this he has no [[right]] to [[complain]],
unless he has merited their favour by special excellence in his social
relations, and has thus established a title to their [[good]] offices, which
is not affected by his demerits towards himself.

what i contend for is, that the inconveniences which are strictly
inseparable from the unfavourable [[judgment]] of others, are the only ones
to which a [[person]] should ever be subjected for that portion of his
conduct and [[character]] which concerns his own [[good]], but which does not
affect the interests of others in their relations with him. acts
injurious to others require a totally different treatment. encroachment
on their rights [[right]]; infliction on them of any loss or damage not justified
by his own rights [[right]]; falsehood or duplicity in dealing with them; unfair
or ungenerous use of advantages over them; even selfish abstinence from
defending them against injury--these are fit objects of moral
reprobation, and, in grave cases, of [[moral]] retribution and [[punishment]].
and not only these acts, but the dispositions which lead to them, are
properly immoral, and fit subjects [[subject]] of disapprobation which may rise to
abhorrence. [[cruelty]] of disposition; malice and ill-nature; that most
anti-social and odious of all [[passions]], envy; dissimulation and
insincerity; irascibility on insufficient cause, and resentment
disproportioned to the provocation; the [[love]] of domineering over others;
the [[desire]] to engross more than one's share of advantages (the [greek:
pleonexia] of the greeks); the [[pride]] which derives gratification from
the abasement of others; the egotism which thinks [[think]] [[self]] and its concerns
more important than everything else, and decides all doubtful questions
in its own favour;--these are [[moral]] vices [[vice]], and constitute a [[bad]] and
odious [[moral]] [[character]]: unlike the self-regarding faults [[fault]] previously
mentioned, which are not properly immoralities, and to whatever pitch
they may be carried, do not constitute wickedness. they may be proofs of
any amount of folly, or want of personal [[dignity]] and self-respect; but
they are only a [[subject]] of [[moral]] reprobation when they involve a breach
of [[duty]] to others, for whose sake the [[individual]] is bound to have care
for himself. what are called duties [[duty]] to ourselves are not socially
obligatory, unless circumstances render them at the same [[time]] duties [[duty]] to
others. the term [[duty]] to oneself, when it means anything more than
prudence, means self-respect or self-development; and for none of these
is any one accountable to his fellow-creatures, because for none of them
is it for the [[good]] of [[mankind]] that he be held accountable to them.

the distinction between the loss of consideration which a [[person]] may
rightly incur by defect of prudence or of personal [[dignity]], and the
reprobation which is due to him for an offence against the rights [[right]] of
others, is not a merely nominal distinction. it makes a vast difference
both in our feelings and in our conduct towards him, whether he
displeases us in things in which we [[think]] we have a [[right]] to control
him, or in things in which we [[know]] that we have not. if he displeases
us, we may express our distaste, and we may stand aloof from a [[person]] as
well as from a thing that displeases us; but we shall not therefore feel
called on to make his [[life]] uncomfortable. we shall reflect that he
already bears, or will bear, the whole penalty of his error; if he
spoils his [[life]] by mismanagement, we shall not, for that [[reason]], desire
to spoil it still further: instead of wishing to punish him, we shall
rather endeavour to alleviate his [[punishment]], by showing him how he may
avoid or cure the evils [[evil]] his conduct tends to bring upon him. he may be
to us an object of [[pity]], perhaps of dislike, but not of anger or
resentment; we shall not treat him like an [[enemy]] of [[society]]: the worst
we shall [[think]] ourselves justified in doing is leaving him to himself,
if we do not interfere benevolently by showing interest or concern for
him. it is far otherwise if he has infringed the rules [[rule]] necessary for the
protection of his fellow-creatures, individually or collectively. the
evil consequences of his acts do not then fall on himself, but on
others; and [[society]], as the protector of all its members, must retaliate
on him; must inflict [[pain]] on him for the express [[purpose]] of [[punishment]],
and must take [[care]] that it be sufficiently severe. in the one case, he
is an offender at our bar, and we are called on not only to sit in
judgment on him, but, in one shape or another, to execute our own
sentence: in the other case, it is not our part to inflict any suffering
on him, except what may incidentally [[follow]] from our using the same
liberty in the regulation of our own affairs, which we allow to him in
his.

the distinction here pointed out between the part of a person's life
which concerns only himself, and that which concerns others, many
persons will refuse to admit. how (it may be asked) can any part of the
conduct of a member of [[society]] be a matter of indifference to the other
members? no [[person]] is an entirely isolated being; it is impossible for a
person to do anything seriously or permanently hurtful to himself,
without mischief reaching at least to his near connections, and often
far beyond them. if he injures his [[property]], he does harm to those who
directly or indirectly derived support from it, and usually diminishes,
by a greater or less amount, the general resources of the [[community]]. if
he deteriorates his bodily or mental faculties, he not only brings evil
upon all who depended on him for any portion of their [[happiness]], but
disqualifies himself for rendering the services which he owes to his
fellow-creatures generally; perhaps becomes a burthen on their affection
or benevolence; and if such conduct were very frequent, hardly any
offence that is committed would detract more from the general sum of
good. finally, if by his vices [[vice]] or follies a [[person]] does no direct harm
to others, he is nevertheless (it may be said) injurious by his [[example]];
and ought to be compelled to control himself, for the sake of those whom
the sight or [[knowledge]] of his conduct might [[corrupt]] or mislead.

and even (it will be added) if the consequences of misconduct could be
confined to the vicious or thoughtless [[individual]], ought [[society]] to
abandon to their own guidance those who are manifestly unfit for it? if
protection against themselves is confessedly due to [[children]] and persons
under [[age]], is not [[society]] equally bound to afford it to persons [[person]] of
mature years who are equally incapable of self-government? if gambling,
or drunkenness, or incontinence, or idleness, or uncleanliness, are as
injurious to [[happiness]], and as [[great]] a hindrance to improvement, as many
or most of the acts prohibited by [[law]], why (it may be asked) should not
law, so far as is consistent with practicability and social convenience,
endeavour to repress these also? and as a supplement to the unavoidable
imperfections of [[law]], ought not [[opinion]] at least to organise a powerful
police against these vices [[vice]], and visit rigidly with social penalties
those who are known to practise them? there is no [[question]] here (it may
be said) about restricting individuality, or impeding the [[trial]] of new
and original experiments in living. the only things it is sought to
prevent are things which have been tried and condemned from the
beginning of the [[world]] until now; things which [[experience]] has shown not
to be useful or suitable to any person's individuality. there must be
some length of [[time]] and amount of [[experience]], after which a [[moral]] or
prudential [[truth]] may be regarded as established: and it is merely
desired to prevent [[generation]] after [[generation]] from falling over the
same precipice which has been fatal to their predecessors.

i fully admit that the mischief which a [[person]] does to himself, may
seriously affect, both through their sympathies and their interests,
those nearly connected with him, and in a minor [[degree]], [[society]] at
large. when, by conduct of this sort, a [[person]] is [[led]] to violate a
distinct and assignable obligation to any other [[person]] or persons [[person]], the
case is taken out of the self-regarding class, and becomes amenable to
moral disapprobation in the proper sense of the term. if, for [[example]],
a [[man]], through intemperance or extravagance, becomes unable to [[pay]] his
debts, or, having undertaken the [[moral]] responsibility of a [[family]],
becomes from the same cause incapable of supporting or educating them,
he is deservedly reprobated, and might be justly punished; but it is for
the breach of [[duty]] to his [[family]] or creditors, not for the extravagance.
if the resources which ought to have been devoted to them, had been
diverted from them for the most prudent investment, the moral
culpability would have been the same. george barnwell murdered his uncle
to get [[money]] for his mistress, but if he had done it to set himself up
in [[business]], he would equally have been [[hanged]]. again, in the frequent
case of a [[man]] who causes [[grief]] to his [[family]] by addiction to [[bad]] habits,
he deserves reproach for his unkindness or ingratitude; but so he may
for cultivating habits not in themselves vicious, if they are painful to
those with whom he passes his [[life]], or who from personal ties are
dependent on him for their comfort. whoever fails in the consideration
generally due to the interests and feelings of others, not being
compelled by some more imperative [[duty]], or justified by allowable
self-preference, is a [[subject]] of [[moral]] disapprobation for that failure,
but not for the cause of it, nor for the errors, merely personal to
himself, which may have remotely [[led]] to it. in like manner, when a
person disables himself, by conduct purely self-regarding, from the
performance of some definite [[duty]] incumbent on him to the [[public]], he is
guilty of a social offence. no [[person]] ought to be punished simply for
being drunk; but a soldier or a policeman should be punished for being
drunk on [[duty]]. whenever, in short, there is a definite damage, or a
definite risk of damage, either to an [[individual]] or to the [[public]], the
case is taken out of the province of [[liberty]], and placed in that of
morality or [[law]].

but with regard to the merely contingent, or, as it may be called,
constructive injury which a [[person]] causes to [[society]], by conduct which
neither violates any specific [[duty]] to the [[public]], nor occasions
perceptible hurt to any assignable [[individual]] except himself; the
inconvenience is one which [[society]] can afford to bear, for the sake of
the greater [[good]] of [[human]] [[freedom]]. if grown persons [[person]] are to be punished
for not taking proper [[care]] of themselves, i would rather it were for
their own sake, than under pretence of preventing them from impairing
their capacity of rendering to [[society]] benefits which [[society]] does not
pretend it has a [[right]] to exact. but i cannot [[consent]] to argue the
point as if [[society]] had no means of bringing its weaker members up to
its ordinary standard of [[rational]] conduct, except waiting till they do
something irrational, and then punishing them, legally or morally, for
it. [[society]] has had absolute [[power]] over them during all the early
portion of their existence: it has had the whole period of [[childhood]] and
nonage in which to try whether it could make them capable of rational
conduct in [[life]]. the existing [[generation]] is master both of the training
and the entire circumstances of the [[generation]] to come; it cannot indeed
make them perfectly [[wise]] and [[good]], because it is itself so lamentably
deficient in goodness and [[wisdom]]; and its [[best]] efforts are not always,
in [[individual]] cases, its most successful ones; but it is perfectly well
able to make the rising [[generation]], as a whole, as [[good]] as, and a little
better than, itself. if [[society]] lets any considerable number of its
members grow up mere [[children]], incapable of being acted on by rational
consideration of distant motives, [[society]] has itself to blame for the
consequences. armed not only with all the powers [[power]] of [[education]], but with
the ascendency which the [[authority]] of a received [[opinion]] always
exercises over the minds [[mind]] who are least fitted to [[judge]] for themselves;
and aided by the _natural_ penalties which cannot be prevented from
falling on those who incur the distaste or the contempt of those who
know them; let not [[society]] pretend that it needs, besides all this, the
power to issue commands and enforce [[obedience]] in the personal concerns
of individuals [[individual]], in which, on all principles [[principle]] of [[justice]] and policy, the
decision ought to rest with those who are to abide the consequences. nor
is there anything which tends more to discredit and frustrate the better
means of influencing conduct, than a resort to the worse. if there be
among those whom it is attempted to coerce into prudence or temperance,
any of the material of which vigorous and independent characters [[character]] are
made, they will infallibly rebel against the yoke. no such [[person]] will
ever [[feel]] that others have a [[right]] to control him in his concerns, such
as they have to prevent him from injuring them in theirs; and it easily
comes to be considered a mark of spirit and [[courage]] to fly in the face
of such usurped [[authority]], and do with ostentation the exact opposite of
what it enjoins; as in the [[fashion]] of grossness which succeeded, in the
time of charles ii., to the fanatical [[moral]] intolerance of the puritans.
with [[respect]] to what is said of the necessity of protecting society
from the [[bad]] [[example]] set to others by the vicious or the
self-indulgent; it is true that [[bad]] [[example]] may have a pernicious
effect, especially the [[example]] of doing [[wrong]] to others with impunity to
the wrong-doer. but we are now speaking of conduct which, while it does
no [[wrong]] to others, is supposed to do [[great]] harm to the agent himself:
and i do not see how those who [[believe]] this, can [[think]] otherwise than
that the [[example]], on the whole, must be more salutary than hurtful,
since, if it displays the misconduct, it displays also the painful or
degrading consequences which, if the conduct is justly censured, must be
supposed to be in all or most cases attendant on it.

but the strongest of all the arguments against the interference of the
public with purely personal conduct, is that when it does interfere, the
odds are that it interferes wrongly, and in the [[wrong]] place. on
questions of social morality, of [[duty]] to others, the [[opinion]] of the
public, that is, of an overruling majority, though often [[wrong]], is
likely to be still oftener [[right]]; because on such questions [[question]] they are
only required to [[judge]] of their own interests; of the manner in which
some mode of conduct, if allowed to be practised, would affect
themselves. but the [[opinion]] of a similar majority, imposed as a [[law]] on
the minority, on questions [[question]] of self-regarding conduct, is quite as
likely to be [[wrong]] as [[right]]; for in these cases [[public]] [[opinion]] means, at
the [[best]], some people's [[opinion]] of what is [[good]] or [[bad]] for other [[people]];
while very often it does not even mean that; the [[public]], with the most
perfect indifference, passing over the [[pleasure]] or convenience of those
whose conduct they censure, and considering only their own preference.
there are many who consider as an injury to themselves any conduct which
they have a distaste for, and resent it as an outrage to their feelings;
as a [[religious]] bigot, when charged with disregarding the religious
feelings of others, has been known to retort that they disregard his
feelings, by persisting in their abominable [[worship]] or creed. but there
is no parity between the feeling of a [[person]] for his own [[opinion]], and
the feeling of another who is offended at his holding it; no more than
between the [[desire]] of a thief to take a purse, and the [[desire]] of the
right owner to keep it. and a person's taste is as much his own peculiar
concern as his [[opinion]] or his purse. it is easy for any one to imagine
an ideal [[public]], which leaves the [[freedom]] and [[choice]] of individuals [[individual]] in
all uncertain matters undisturbed, and only requires them to abstain
from modes of conduct which universal [[experience]] has condemned. but
where has there been seen a [[public]] which set any such limit to its
censorship? or when does the [[public]] trouble itself about universal
experience? in its interferences with personal conduct it is seldom
thinking of anything but the enormity of acting or feeling differently
from itself; and this standard of [[judgment]], thinly disguised, is held up
to [[mankind]] as the dictate of [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], by nine-tenths of
all moralists and speculative writers. these [[teach]] that things are right
because they are [[right]]; because we [[feel]] them to be so. they tell us to
search in our own minds [[mind]] and hearts [[heart]] for laws [[law]] of conduct binding on
ourselves and on all others. what can the [[poor]] [[public]] do but apply these
instructions, and make their own personal feelings of [[good]] and [[evil]], if
they are tolerably unanimous in them, obligatory on all the [[world]]?

the [[evil]] here pointed out is not one which exists only in theory; and it
may perhaps be expected that i should specify the instances in which the
public of this [[age]] and [[country]] improperly invests its own preferences
with the [[character]] of [[moral]] laws [[law]]. i am not writing an essay on the
aberrations of existing [[moral]] feeling. that is too weighty a [[subject]] to
be discussed parenthetically, and by way of illustration. yet examples
are necessary, to show that the [[principle]] i maintain is of serious and
practical moment, and that i am not endeavouring to erect a barrier
against imaginary evils [[evil]]. and it is not difficult to show, by abundant
instances, that to extend the bounds of what may be called [[moral]] [[police]],
until it encroaches on the most unquestionably legitimate [[liberty]] of the
individual, is one of the most universal of all [[human]] propensities.

as a first instance, consider the antipathies which [[men]] cherish on no
better grounds than that persons [[person]] whose [[religious]] opinions [[opinion]] are different
from theirs, do not practise their [[religious]] observances, especially
their [[religious]] abstinences. to cite a rather trivial [[example]], nothing
in the creed or practice of christians [[christian]] does more to envenom the hatred
of mahomedans against them, than the [[fact]] of their eating pork. there
are few acts which christians [[christian]] and europeans [[european]] regard with more unaffected
disgust, than mussulmans regard this particular mode of satisfying
hunger. it is, in the first place, an offence against their [[religion]];
but this circumstance by no means explains either the [[degree]] or the kind
of their repugnance; for wine also is forbidden by their [[religion]], and
to partake of it is by all mussulmans accounted [[wrong]], but not
disgusting. their aversion to the flesh of the "unclean beast" is, on
the contrary, of that peculiar [[character]], resembling an instinctive
antipathy, which the [[idea]] of uncleanness, when once it thoroughly sinks
into the feelings, seems always to excite even in those whose personal
habits are anything but scrupulously cleanly, and of which the sentiment
of [[religious]] impurity, so intense in the hindoos, is a remarkable
example. suppose now that in a [[people]], of whom the majority were
mussulmans, that majority should insist upon not permitting pork to be
eaten within the limits of the [[country]]. this would be nothing new in
mahomedan countries [[country]].[14] would it be a legitimate exercise of the moral
authority of [[public]] [[opinion]]? and if not, why not? the practice is really
revolting to such a [[public]]. they also sincerely [[think]] that it is
forbidden and abhorred by the deity. neither could the prohibition be
censured as [[religious]] persecution. it might be [[religious]] in its origin,
but it would not be persecution for [[religion]], since nobody's religion
makes it a [[duty]] to [[eat]] pork. the only tenable ground of condemnation
would be, that with the personal tastes and self-regarding concerns of
individuals the [[public]] has no [[business]] to interfere.

to come somewhat nearer [[home]]: the majority of spaniards consider it a
gross impiety, offensive in the highest [[degree]] to the supreme being, to
worship him in any other manner than the roman catholic; and no other
public [[worship]] is lawful on spanish soil. the [[people]] of all southern
europe look upon a [[married]] clergy as not only irreligious, but unchaste,
indecent, gross, disgusting. what do protestants [[think]] of these
perfectly sincere feelings, and of the attempt to enforce them against
non-catholics? yet, if [[mankind]] are justified in interfering with each
other's [[liberty]] in things which do not concern the interests of others,
on what [[principle]] is it possible consistently to exclude these cases? or
who can blame [[people]] for desiring to suppress what they regard as a
scandal in the sight of [[god]] and [[man]]? no stronger case can be shown for
prohibiting anything which is regarded as a personal immorality, than
is made out for suppressing these practices in the [[eyes]] of those who
regard them as impieties; and unless we are willing to adopt the logic
of persecutors, and to say that we may [[persecute]] others because we are
right, and that they must not [[persecute]] us because they are [[wrong]], we
must beware of admitting a [[principle]] of which we should resent as a
gross [[injustice]] the application to ourselves.

the preceding instances may be objected to, although unreasonably, as
drawn from contingencies impossible among us: [[opinion]], in this [[country]],
not being likely to enforce abstinence from meats, or to interfere with
people for worshipping, and for either marrying or not marrying,
according to their creed or inclination. the next [[example]], however,
shall be taken from an interference with [[liberty]] which we have by no
means passed all danger of. wherever the puritans have been sufficiently
powerful, as in new [[england]], and in [[great]] [[britain]] at the [[time]] of the
commonwealth, they have endeavoured, with considerable [[success]], to put
down all [[public]], and nearly all private, amusements: especially [[music]],
dancing, [[public]] games, or other assemblages for purposes [[purpose]] of diversion,
and the theatre. there are still in this [[country]] large bodies [[body]] of
persons by whose notions of morality and [[religion]] these recreations are
condemned; and those persons [[person]] belonging chiefly to the middle class, who
are the ascendant [[power]] in the [[present]] social and [[political]] condition of
the [[kingdom]], it is by no means impossible that persons [[person]] of these
sentiments may at some [[time]] or other command a majority in [[parliament]].
how will the remaining portion of the [[community]] like to have the
amusements that shall be permitted to them regulated by the religious
and [[moral]] sentiments of the stricter calvinists and methodists? would
they not, with considerable peremptoriness, [[desire]] these intrusively
pious members of [[society]] to [[mind]] their own [[business]]? this is precisely
what should be said to every [[government]] and every [[public]], who have the
pretension that no [[person]] shall enjoy any [[pleasure]] which they think
wrong. but if the [[principle]] of the pretension be admitted, no one can
reasonably object to its being acted on in the sense of the majority, or
other preponderating [[power]] in the [[country]]; and all persons [[person]] must be ready
to conform to the [[idea]] of a [[christian]] commonwealth, as understood by the
early settlers in new [[england]], if a [[religious]] profession similar to
theirs should ever succeed in regaining its lost ground, as religions
supposed to be declining have so often been known to do.

to imagine another contingency, perhaps more likely to be realised than
the one [[last]] mentioned. there is confessedly a [[strong]] tendency in the
modern [[world]] towards a democratic [[constitution]] of [[society]], accompanied
or not by popular [[political]] [[institutions]]. it is affirmed that in the
country where this tendency is most completely realised--where both
society and the [[government]] are most democratic--the [[united]] states--the
feeling of the majority, to whom any appearance of a more showy or
costly style of living than they can [[hope]] to rival is disagreeable,
operates as a tolerably effectual sumptuary [[law]], and that in many parts
of the union it is really difficult for a [[person]] possessing a very large
income, to find any mode of spending it, which will not incur popular
disapprobation. though such statements as these are doubtless much
exaggerated as a representation of existing facts [[fact]], the [[state]] of things
they describe is not only a conceivable and possible, but a probable
result of democratic feeling, combined with the notion that the public
has a [[right]] to a veto on the manner in which individuals [[individual]] shall spend
their incomes. we have only further to suppose a considerable diffusion
of socialist opinions [[opinion]], and it may become infamous in the [[eyes]] of the
majority to possess more [[property]] than some very small amount, or any
income not earned by manual [[labour]]. opinions [[opinion]] similar in [[principle]] to
these, already prevail widely among the artisan class, and weigh
oppressively on those who are amenable to the [[opinion]] chiefly of that
class, namely, its own members. it is known that the [[bad]] workmen who
form the majority of the operatives in many branches of industry, are
decidedly of [[opinion]] that [[bad]] workmen ought to receive the same wages as
good, and that no one ought to be allowed, through piecework or
otherwise, to earn by superior [[skill]] or industry more than others can
without it. and they employ a [[moral]] [[police]], which occasionally becomes a
physical one, to deter skilful workmen from receiving, and employers
from giving, a larger remuneration for a more useful service. if the
public have any jurisdiction over private concerns, i cannot see that
these [[people]] are in [[fault]], or that any individual's particular public
can be blamed for asserting the same [[authority]] over his individual
conduct, which the general [[public]] asserts over [[people]] in general.

but, without dwelling upon supposititious cases, there are, in our own
day, gross usurpations upon the [[liberty]] of private [[life]] actually
practised, and still greater ones threatened with some expectation of
success, and opinions [[opinion]] proposed which assert an unlimited [[right]] in the
public not only to prohibit by [[law]] everything which it thinks [[think]] [[wrong]], but
in order to get at what it thinks [[think]] [[wrong]], to prohibit any number of
things which it admits to be [[innocent]].

under the name of preventing intemperance, the [[people]] of one english
colony, and of nearly half the [[united]] states, have been interdicted by
law from making any use whatever of fermented drinks, except for medical
purposes: for prohibition of their sale is in [[fact]], as it is intended to
be, prohibition of their use. and though the impracticability of
executing the [[law]] has caused its repeal in several of the states which
had adopted it, including the one from which it derives its name, an
attempt has notwithstanding been commenced, and is prosecuted with
considerable zeal by many of the professed philanthropists, to agitate
for a similar [[law]] in this [[country]]. the association, or "alliance" as it
terms itself, which has been formed for this [[purpose]], has acquired some
notoriety through the publicity given to a correspondence between its
secretary and one of the very few english [[public]] [[men]] who hold that a
politician's opinions [[opinion]] ought to be founded on principles [[principle]]. [[lord]] stanley's
share in this correspondence is calculated to strengthen the hopes
already built on him, by those who [[know]] how rare such qualities as are
manifested in some of his [[public]] appearances, unhappily are among those
who figure in [[political]] [[life]]. the organ of the [[alliance]], who would
"deeply deplore the recognition of any [[principle]] which could be wrested
to justify bigotry and persecution," undertakes to point out the "broad
and impassable barrier" which divides such principles [[principle]] from those of the
association. "all matters relating to [[thought]], [[opinion]], [[conscience]],
appear to me," he says, "to be without the sphere of legislation; all
pertaining to social act, habit, relation, [[subject]] only to a
discretionary [[power]] vested in the [[state]] itself, and not in the
individual, to be within it." no mention is made of a third class,
different from either of these, viz. acts and habits which are not
social, but [[individual]]; although it is to this class, surely, that the
act of drinking fermented liquors belongs. selling fermented liquors,
however, is trading, and trading is a social act. but the infringement
complained of is not on the [[liberty]] of the seller, but on that of the
buyer and consumer; since the [[state]] might just as well forbid him to
drink wine, as purposely make it impossible for him to obtain it. the
secretary, however, says, "i claim, as a citizen, a [[right]] to legislate
whenever my social rights [[right]] are invaded by the social act of another." and
now for the definition of these "social rights [[right]]." "if anything invades my
social rights [[right]], certainly the traffic in [[strong]] drink does. it destroys
my primary [[right]] of security, by constantly creating and stimulating
social disorder. it invades my [[right]] of equality, by deriving a profit
from the creation of a misery, i am taxed to support. it impedes my
right to [[free]] [[moral]] and intellectual [[development]], by surrounding my path
with dangers, and by weakening and demoralising [[society]], from which i
have a [[right]] to claim mutual aid and intercourse." a theory of "social
rights," the like of which probably never before found its way into
distinct language--being nothing short of this--that it is the absolute
social [[right]] of every [[individual]], that every other [[individual]] shall act
in every [[respect]] exactly as he ought; that whosoever fails thereof in
the smallest particular, violates my social [[right]], and entitles me to
demand from the legislature the removal of the grievance. so monstrous a
principle is far more dangerous than any [[single]] interference with
liberty; there is no violation of [[liberty]] which it would not justify;
it acknowledges no [[right]] to any [[freedom]] whatever, except perhaps to that
of holding opinions [[opinion]] in secret, without ever disclosing them: for the
moment an [[opinion]] which i consider noxious, passes any one's lips, it
invades all the "social rights" attributed to me by the [[alliance]]. the
doctrine ascribes to all [[mankind]] a vested interest in each other's
moral, intellectual, and even physical [[perfection]], to be defined by each
claimant according to his own standard.

another important [[example]] of illegitimate interference with the rightful
liberty of the [[individual]], not simply threatened, but long since carried
into triumphant effect, is sabbatarian legislation. without [[doubt]],
abstinence on one day in the week, so far as the exigencies of life
permit, from the usual daily occupation, though in no respect
religiously binding on any except [[jews]], is a highly beneficial custom.
and inasmuch as this custom cannot be observed without a general consent
to that effect among the industrious classes, therefore, in so far as
some persons [[person]] by working may impose the same necessity on others, it may
be allowable and [[right]] that the [[law]] should guarantee to each, the
observance by others of the custom, by suspending the greater operations
of industry on a particular day. but this justification, grounded on the
direct interest which others have in each individual's observance of
the practice, does not apply to the self-chosen occupations in which a
person may [[think]] fit to employ his leisure; nor does it hold [[good]], in
the smallest [[degree]], for legal restrictions on amusements. it is true
that the amusement of some is the day's [[work]] of others; but the
pleasure, not to say the useful recreation, of many, is worth the labour
of a few, provided the occupation is freely chosen, and can be freely
resigned. the operatives are perfectly [[right]] in thinking that if all
worked on sunday, seven days' [[work]] would have to be given for six days'
wages: but so long as the [[great]] mass of employments are suspended, the
small number who for the enjoyment of others must still [[work]], obtain a
proportional increase of earnings; and they are not obliged to follow
those occupations, if they prefer leisure to emolument. if a further
remedy is sought, it might be found in the establishment by custom of a
holiday on some other day of the week for those particular classes of
persons. the only ground, therefore, on which restrictions on sunday
amusements can be defended, must be that they are religiously [[wrong]]; a
motive of legislation which never can be too earnestly protested
against. "deorum injuriæ diis curæ." it remains to be proved that
society or any of its officers holds a commission from on high to
avenge any supposed offence to omnipotence, which is not also a [[wrong]] to
our fellow-creatures. the notion that it is one man's [[man]] [[duty]] that another
should be [[religious]], was the foundation of all the religious
persecutions ever perpetrated, and if admitted, would fully justify
them. though the feeling which breaks out in the repeated attempts to
stop railway travelling on sunday, in the [[resistance]] to the opening of
museums, and the like, has not the [[cruelty]] of the old persecutors, the
state of [[mind]] indicated by it is fundamentally the same. it is a
determination not to tolerate others in doing what is permitted by their
religion, because it is not permitted by the persecutor's [[religion]]. it
is a [[belief]] that [[god]] not only abominates the act of the misbeliever, but
will not hold us guiltless if we leave him unmolested.

i cannot refrain from adding to these examples [[example]] of the little account
commonly made of [[human]] [[liberty]], the [[language]] of downright persecution
which breaks out from the press of this [[country]], whenever it feels
called on to notice the remarkable phenomenon of mormonism. much might
be said on the unexpected and instructive [[fact]], that an alleged new
revelation, and a [[religion]] founded on it, the product of palpable
imposture, not even supported by the _prestige_ of extraordinary
qualities in its founder, is believed by hundreds of thousands, and has
been made the foundation of a [[society]], in the [[age]] of newspapers,
railways, and the electric telegraph. what here concerns us is, that
this [[religion]], like other and [[better]] religions [[religion]], has its martyrs; that
its [[prophet]] and founder was, for his teaching, put to [[death]] by a mob;
that others of its adherents lost their lives [[life]] by the same lawless
violence; that they were forcibly expelled, in a [[body]], from the country
in which they first grew up; while, now that they have been chased into
a solitary recess in the midst of a desert, many in this [[country]] openly
declare that it would be [[right]] (only that it is not convenient) to send
an expedition against them, and compel them by [[force]] to conform to the
opinions of other [[people]]. the article of the mormonite doctrine which is
the [[chief]] provocative to the antipathy which thus breaks through the
ordinary restraints of [[religious]] tolerance, is its sanction of polygamy;
which, though permitted to mahomedans, and hindoos, and chinese, seems
to excite unquenchable animosity when practised by persons [[person]] who speak
english, and profess to be a [[kind]] of christians [[christian]]. no one has a deeper
disapprobation than i have of this mormon institution; both for other
reasons, and because, far from being in any way countenanced by the
principle of [[liberty]], it is a direct infraction of that [[principle]], being
a mere riveting of the chains of one half of the [[community]], and an
emancipation of the other from reciprocity of obligation towards them.
still, it must be remembered that this relation is as much voluntary on
the part of the [[women]] concerned in it, and who may be deemed the
sufferers by it, as is the case with any other form of the marriage
institution; and however surprising this [[fact]] may appear, it has its
explanation in the [[common]] ideas [[idea]] and customs of the [[world]], which teaching
women to [[think]] [[marriage]] the one thing needful, make it intelligible that
many a woman should prefer being one of several wives [[wife]], to not being a
wife at all. other countries [[country]] are not [[asked]] to recognise such unions, or
release any portion of their inhabitants from their own laws [[law]] on the
score of mormonite opinions [[opinion]]. but when the dissentients have conceded to
the hostile sentiments of others, far more than could justly be
demanded; when they have left the countries [[country]] to which their doctrines
were unacceptable, and established themselves in a remote corner of the
earth, which they have been the first to render habitable to human
beings; it is difficult to see on what principles [[principle]] but those of tyranny
they can be prevented from living there under what laws [[law]] they please,
provided they commit no aggression on other nations, and allow perfect
freedom of departure to those who are dissatisfied with their ways. a
recent writer, in some respects [[respect]] of considerable [[merit]], proposes (to use
his own words), not a crusade, but a _civilizade_, against this
polygamous [[community]], to put an end to what seems to him a retrograde
step in civilisation. it also appears so to me, but i am not aware that
any [[community]] has a [[right]] to [[force]] another to be civilised. so long as
the sufferers by the [[bad]] [[law]] do not invoke assistance from other
communities, i cannot admit that persons [[person]] entirely unconnected with them
ought to step in and require that a condition of things with which all
who are directly interested appear to be satisfied, should be put an end
to because it is a scandal to persons [[person]] some thousands of miles distant,
who have no part or concern in it. let them send missionaries, if they
please, to preach against it; and let them, by any [[fair]] means (of which
silencing the teachers is not one), oppose the [[progress]] of similar
doctrines among their own [[people]]. if civilisation has got the [[better]] of
barbarism when barbarism had the [[world]] to itself, it is too much to
profess to be afraid lest barbarism, after having been fairly got under,
should revive and conquer civilisation. a civilisation that can thus
succumb to its vanquished [[enemy]], must first have become so degenerate,
that neither its appointed priests [[priest]] and teachers, nor anybody else, has
the capacity, or will take the trouble, to stand up for it. if this be
so, the sooner such a civilisation receives notice to quit, the [[better]].
it can only go on from [[bad]] to worse, until destroyed and regenerated
(like the western empire) by energetic barbarians.

footnote:

[14] the case of the bombay parsees is a [[curious]] instance in point. when
this industrious and enterprising tribe, the descendants of the persian
fire-worshippers, flying from their native [[country]] before the caliphs,
arrived in western [[india]], they were admitted to toleration by the hindoo
sovereigns, on condition of not eating beef. when those regions
afterwards fell under the dominion of mahomedan conquerors, the parsees
obtained from them a continuance of indulgence, on condition of
refraining from pork. what was at first [[obedience]] to [[authority]] became a
second [[nature]], and the parsees to this day abstain both from beef and
pork. though not required by their [[religion]], the double abstinence has
had [[time]] to grow into a custom of their tribe; and custom, in the east,
is a [[religion]].




chapter v.

applications.


the principles [[principle]] asserted in these pages must be more generally admitted
as the basis for discussion of details, before a consistent application
of them to all the various departments of [[government]] and morals [[moral]] can be
attempted with any prospect of advantage. the few observations i propose
to make on questions [[question]] of detail, are designed to illustrate the
principles, rather than to [[follow]] them out to their consequences. i
offer, not so much applications, as specimens of application; which may
serve to bring into greater clearness the meaning and limits of the two
maxims which together form the entire doctrine of this essay, and to
assist the [[judgment]] in holding the balance between them, in the cases
where it appears doubtful which of them is applicable to the case.

the maxims [[maxim]] are, first, that the [[individual]] is not accountable to society
for his actions, in so far as these concern the interests of no person
but himself. [[advice]], instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other
people if [[thought]] necessary by them for their own [[good]], are the only
measures by which [[society]] can justifiably express its dislike or
disapprobation of his conduct. secondly, that for such actions as are
prejudicial to the interests of others, the [[individual]] is accountable
and may be subjected either to social or to legal punishments [[punishment]], if
society is of [[opinion]] that the one or the other is requisite for its
protection.

in the first place, it must by no means be supposed, because damage, or
probability of damage, to the interests of others, can alone justify the
interference of [[society]], that therefore it always does justify such
interference. in many cases, an [[individual]], in pursuing a legitimate
object, necessarily and therefore legitimately causes [[pain]] or loss to
others, or intercepts a [[good]] which they had a reasonable [[hope]] of
obtaining. such oppositions of interest between individuals [[individual]] often arise
from [[bad]] social [[institutions]], but are unavoidable while those
institutions [[last]]; and some would be unavoidable under any [[institutions]].
whoever succeeds in an overcrowded profession, or in a competitive
examination; whoever is preferred to another in any contest for an
object which both [[desire]], reaps benefit from the loss of others, from
their wasted exertion and their disappointment. but it is, by common
admission, [[better]] for the general interest of [[mankind]], that persons
should pursue their objects undeterred by this sort of consequences. in
other words, [[society]] admits no rights [[right]], either legal or [[moral]], in the
disappointed competitors, to immunity from this [[kind]] of suffering; and
feels called on to interfere, only when means of [[success]] have been
employed which it is contrary to the general interest to permit--namely,
fraud or treachery, and [[force]].

again, [[trade]] is a social act. whoever undertakes to sell any description
of goods [[good]] to the [[public]], does what affects the interest of other persons [[person]],
and of [[society]] in general; and thus his conduct, in [[principle]], comes
within the jurisdiction of [[society]]: accordingly, it was once held to be
the [[duty]] of governments [[government]], in all cases which were considered of
importance, to fix prices, and regulate the processes of manufacture.
but it is now recognised, though not till after a long struggle, that
both the cheapness and the [[good]] quality of commodities are most
effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly
free, under the sole check of [[equal]] [[freedom]] to the buyers for supplying
themselves elsewhere. this is the so-called doctrine of [[free]] [[trade]],
which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the
principle of [[individual]] [[liberty]] asserted in this essay. restrictions on
trade, or on production for purposes [[purpose]] of [[trade]], are indeed restraints;
and all restraint, _quâ_ restraint, is an [[evil]]: but the restraints in
question affect only that part of conduct which [[society]] is competent to
restrain, and are [[wrong]] solely because they do not really [[produce]] the
results which it is [[desired]] to [[produce]] by them. as the [[principle]] of
individual [[liberty]] is not involved in the doctrine of [[free]] [[trade]], so
neither is it in most of the questions [[question]] which arise respecting the limits
of that doctrine: as for [[example]], what amount of [[public]] control is
admissible for the prevention of fraud by adulteration; how far sanitary
precautions, or arrangements to [[protect]] work-people employed in
dangerous occupations, should be enforced on employers. such questions
involve considerations of [[liberty]], only in so far as leaving [[people]] to
themselves is always [[better]], _cæteris paribus_, than controlling them:
but that they may be legitimately controlled for these ends, is in
principle undeniable. on the other hand, there are questions [[question]] relating to
interference with [[trade]], which are essentially questions [[question]] of [[liberty]];
such as the maine [[law]], already touched upon; the prohibition of the
importation of opium into [[china]]; the restriction of the sale of poisons;
all cases, in short, where the object of the interference is to make it
impossible or difficult to obtain a particular commodity. these
interferences are objectionable, not as infringements on the [[liberty]] of
the producer or seller, but on that of the buyer.

one of these examples [[example]], that of the sale of poisons, opens a new
question; the proper limits of what may be called the functions of
police; how far [[liberty]] may legitimately be invaded for the prevention
of crime, or of accident. it is one of the undisputed functions of
government to take precautions against crime before it has been
committed, as well as to detect and punish it afterwards. the preventive
function of [[government]], however, is far more liable to be abused, to the
prejudice of [[liberty]], than the punitory function; for there is hardly
any part of the legitimate [[freedom]] of action of a [[human]] being which
would not admit of being represented, and fairly too, as increasing the
facilities for some form or other of delinquency. nevertheless, if a
public [[authority]], or even a private [[person]], sees any one evidently
preparing to commit a crime, they are not bound to look on inactive
until the crime is committed, but may interfere to prevent it. if
poisons were never bought or used for any [[purpose]] except the commission
of murder, it would be [[right]] to prohibit their manufacture and sale.
they may, however, be wanted not only for [[innocent]] but for useful
purposes, and restrictions cannot be imposed in the one case without
operating in the other. again, it is a proper office of [[public]] authority
to guard against accidents. if either a [[public]] officer or any one else
saw a [[person]] attempting to cross a bridge which had been ascertained to
be unsafe, and there were no [[time]] to warn him of his danger, they might
seize him and turn him back, without any real infringement of his
liberty; for [[liberty]] consists in doing what one desires [[desire]], and he does not
desire to fall into the river. nevertheless, when there is not a
certainty, but only a danger of mischief, no one but the [[person]] himself
can [[judge]] of the sufficiency of the motive which may prompt him to incur
the risk: in this case, therefore (unless he is a child, or delirious,
or in some [[state]] of excitement or absorption incompatible with the full
use of the reflecting faculty), he ought, i conceive, to be only warned
of the danger; not forcibly prevented from exposing himself to it.
similar considerations, applied to such a [[question]] as the sale of
poisons, may enable us to decide which among the possible modes of
regulation are or are not contrary to [[principle]]. such a precaution, for
example, as that of labelling the drug with some word expressive of its
dangerous [[character]], may be enforced without violation of [[liberty]]: the
buyer cannot [[wish]] not to [[know]] that the thing he possesses has poisonous
qualities. but to require in all cases the certificate of a medical
practitioner, would make it sometimes impossible, always expensive, to
obtain the article for legitimate uses. the only mode apparent to me, in
which difficulties may be thrown in the way of crime committed through
this means, without any infringement, worth taking into account, upon
the [[liberty]] of those who [[desire]] the poisonous substance for other
purposes, consists in providing what, in the apt [[language]] of bentham, is
called "preappointed evidence." this provision is familiar to every one
in the case of contracts. it is usual and [[right]] that the [[law]], when a
contract is entered into, should require as the condition of its
enforcing performance, that [[certain]] formalities should be observed, such
as signatures, attestation of witnesses, and the like, in order that in
case of subsequent dispute, there may be evidence to prove that the
contract was really entered into, and that there was nothing in the
circumstances to render it legally invalid: the effect being, to throw
great obstacles in the way of fictitious contracts, or contracts made in
circumstances which, if known, would [[destroy]] their validity. precautions
of a similar [[nature]] might be enforced in the sale of articles adapted to
be instruments of crime. the seller, for [[example]], might be required to
enter into a register the exact [[time]] of the transaction, the name and
address of the buyer, the precise quality and quantity sold; to ask the
purpose for which it was wanted, and record the [[answer]] he received. when
there was no medical prescription, the presence of some third person
might be required, to bring [[home]] the [[fact]] to the purchaser, in case
there should afterwards be [[reason]] to [[believe]] that the article had been
applied to [[criminal]] purposes [[purpose]]. such regulations would in general be no
material impediment to obtaining the article, but a very considerable
one to making an improper use of it without detection.

the [[right]] inherent in [[society]], to ward off crimes against itself by
antecedent precautions, suggests the obvious limitations to the [[maxim]],
that purely self-regarding misconduct cannot properly be meddled with
in the way of prevention or [[punishment]]. drunkenness, for [[example]], in
ordinary cases, is not a fit [[subject]] for legislative interference; but i
should deem it perfectly legitimate that a [[person]], who had once been
convicted of any act of [[violence]] to others under the influence of drink,
should be placed under a special legal restriction, personal to himself;
that if he were afterwards found drunk, he should be liable to a
penalty, and that if when in that [[state]] he committed another offence,
the [[punishment]] to which he would be liable for that other offence should
be increased in severity. the making himself drunk, in a [[person]] whom
drunkenness excites to do harm to others, is a crime against others. so,
again, idleness, except in a [[person]] receiving support from the [[public]],
or except when it constitutes a breach of contract, cannot without
tyranny be made a [[subject]] of legal [[punishment]]; but if either from
idleness or from any other avoidable cause, a [[man]] fails to perform his
legal duties [[duty]] to others, as for instance to support his [[children]], it is
no [[tyranny]] to [[force]] him to fulfil that obligation, by compulsory [[labour]],
if no other means are available.

again, there are many acts which, being directly injurious only to the
agents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted, but which, if
done publicly, are a violation of [[good]] manners and coming thus within
the category of offences against others may rightfully be prohibited. of
this [[kind]] are offences against decency; on which it is unnecessary to
dwell, the rather as they are only connected indirectly with our
subject, the objection to publicity being equally [[strong]] in the case of
many actions not in themselves condemnable, nor supposed to be so.

there is another [[question]] to which an [[answer]] must be found, consistent
with the principles [[principle]] which have been laid down. in cases of personal
conduct supposed to be blamable, but which [[respect]] for [[liberty]] precludes
society from preventing or punishing, because the [[evil]] directly
resulting falls wholly on the agent; what the agent is [[free]] to do, ought
other persons [[person]] to be equally [[free]] to counsel or instigate? this question
is not [[free]] from difficulty. the case of a [[person]] who solicits another
to do an act, is not strictly a case of self-regarding conduct. to give
advice or offer inducements to any one, is a social act, and may
therefore, like actions in general which affect others, be supposed
amenable to social control. but a little reflection corrects the first
impression, by showing that if the case is not strictly within the
definition of [[individual]] [[liberty]], yet the reasons [[reason]] on which the
principle of [[individual]] [[liberty]] is grounded, are applicable to it. if
people must be allowed, in whatever concerns only themselves, to act as
seems [[best]] to themselves at their own peril, they must equally be free
to consult with one another about what is fit to be so done; to exchange
opinions, and give and receive suggestions. whatever it is permitted to
do, it must be permitted to advise to do. the [[question]] is doubtful, only
when the instigator derives a personal benefit from his [[advice]]; when he
makes it his occupation, for subsistence or pecuniary gain, to promote
what [[society]] and the [[state]] consider to be an [[evil]]. then, indeed, a new
element of complication is introduced; namely, the existence of classes
of persons [[person]] with an interest opposed to what is considered as the public
weal, and whose mode of living is grounded on the counteraction of it.
ought this to be interfered with, or not? fornication, for [[example]], must
be tolerated, and so must gambling; but should a [[person]] be [[free]] to be a
pimp, or to keep a gambling-house? the case is one of those which [[lie]] on
the exact boundary line between two principles [[principle]], and it is not at once
apparent to which of the two it properly belongs. there are arguments on
both sides. on the side of toleration it may be said, that the [[fact]] of
following anything as an occupation, and living or profiting by the
practice of it, cannot make that [[criminal]] which would otherwise be
admissible; that the act should either be consistently permitted or
consistently prohibited; that if the principles [[principle]] which we have hitherto
defended are true, [[society]] has no [[business]], _as_ [[society]], to decide
anything to be [[wrong]] which concerns only the [[individual]]; that it cannot
go beyond dissuasion, and that one [[person]] should be as [[free]] to persuade,
as another to dissuade. in opposition to this it may be contended, that
although the [[public]], or the [[state]], are not warranted in authoritatively
deciding, for purposes [[purpose]] of repression or [[punishment]], that such or such
conduct affecting only the interests of the [[individual]] is [[good]] or [[bad]],
they are fully justified in assuming, if they regard it as [[bad]], that its
being so or not is at least a disputable [[question]]: that, this being
supposed, they cannot be acting wrongly in endeavouring to exclude the
influence of solicitations which are not disinterested, of instigators
who cannot possibly be impartial--who have a direct personal interest on
one side, and that side the one which the [[state]] believes [[belief]] to be [[wrong]],
and who confessedly promote it for personal objects only. there can
surely, it may be urged, be nothing lost, no [[sacrifice]] of [[good]], by so
ordering matters that persons [[person]] shall make their election, either wisely
or foolishly, on their own prompting, as [[free]] as possible from the arts
of persons [[person]] who stimulate their inclinations for interested purposes [[purpose]] of
their own. thus (it may be said) though the statutes respecting unlawful
games are utterly indefensible--though all persons [[person]] should be [[free]] to
gamble in their own or each other's houses, or in any place of meeting
established by their own subscriptions, and open only to the members and
their visitors--yet [[public]] gambling-houses should not be permitted. it
is true that the prohibition is never effectual, and that whatever
amount of [[tyrannical]] [[power]] is given to the [[police]], gambling-houses can
always be maintained under other pretences; but they may be compelled to
conduct their operations with a [[certain]] [[degree]] of secrecy and mystery,
so that nobody knows [[know]] anything about them but those who seek them; and
more than this, [[society]] ought not to aim at. there is considerable force
in these arguments; i will not venture to decide whether they are
sufficient to justify the [[moral]] anomaly of punishing the accessary, when
the principal is (and must be) allowed to go [[free]]; or fining or
imprisoning the procurer, but not the fornicator, the gambling-house
keeper, but not the gambler. still less ought the [[common]] operations of
buying and selling to be interfered with on analogous grounds. almost
every article which is bought and sold may be used in excess, and the
sellers have a pecuniary interest in encouraging that excess; but no
argument can be founded on this, in favour, for instance, of the maine
law; because the class of dealers in [[strong]] drinks, though interested in
their [[abuse]], are indispensably required for the sake of their legitimate
use. the interest, however, of these dealers in promoting intemperance
is a real [[evil]], and justifies the [[state]] in imposing restrictions and
requiring guarantees, which but for that justification would be
infringements of legitimate [[liberty]].

a further [[question]] is, whether the [[state]], while it permits, should
nevertheless indirectly discourage conduct which it deems contrary to
the [[best]] interests of the agent; whether, for [[example]], it should take
measures to render the means of drunkenness more costly, or add to the
difficulty of procuring them, by limiting the number of the places of
sale. on this as on most other practical questions [[question]], many distinctions
require to be made. to tax stimulants for the sole [[purpose]] of making
them more difficult to be obtained, is a measure differing only in
degree from their entire prohibition; and would be justifiable only if
that were justifiable. every increase of cost is a prohibition, to those
whose means do not come up to the augmented price; and to those who do,
it is a penalty laid on them for gratifying a particular taste. their
choice of pleasures [[pleasure]], and their mode of expending their income, after
satisfying their legal and [[moral]] obligations to the [[state]] and to
individuals, are their own concern, and must rest with their own
judgment. these considerations may seem at first sight to condemn the
selection of stimulants as special subjects [[subject]] of [[taxation]] for purposes [[purpose]] of
revenue. but it must be remembered that [[taxation]] for fiscal purposes [[purpose]] is
absolutely inevitable; that in most countries [[country]] it is necessary that a
considerable part of that [[taxation]] should be indirect; that the [[state]],
therefore, cannot [[help]] imposing penalties, which to some persons [[person]] may be
prohibitory, on the use of some articles of consumption. it is hence the
duty of the [[state]] to consider, in the imposition of taxes, what
commodities the consumers can [[best]] spare; and _à fortiori_, to select in
preference those of which it deems the use, beyond a very moderate
quantity, to be positively injurious. [[taxation]], therefore, of
stimulants, up to the point which produces [[produce]] the largest amount of revenue
(supposing that the [[state]] needs all the [[revenue]] which it yields) is not
only admissible, but to be approved of.

the [[question]] of making the sale of these commodities a more or less
exclusive [[privilege]], must be answered differently, according to the
purposes to which the restriction is intended to be subservient. all
places of [[public]] resort require the restraint of a [[police]], and places of
this [[kind]] peculiarly, because offences against [[society]] are especially
apt to originate there. it is, therefore, fit to confine the [[power]] of
selling these commodities (at least for consumption on the spot) to
persons of known or vouched-for respectability of conduct; to make such
regulations respecting hours of opening and closing as may be requisite
for [[public]] surveillance, and to withdraw the licence if breaches of the
peace repeatedly take place through the connivance or incapacity of the
keeper of the house, or if it becomes a rendezvous for concocting and
preparing offences against the [[law]]. any further restriction i do not
conceive to be, in [[principle]], justifiable. the limitation in number, for
instance, of beer and spirit-houses, for the express [[purpose]] of
rendering them more difficult of access, and diminishing the occasions
of temptation, not only exposes all to an inconvenience because there
are some by whom the facility would be abused, but is suited only to a
state of [[society]] in which the labouring classes are avowedly treated as
children or savages, and placed under an [[education]] of restraint, to fit
them for future admission to the privileges [[privilege]] of [[freedom]]. this is not the
principle on which the labouring classes are professedly governed in any
free [[country]]; and no [[person]] who sets due value on [[freedom]] will give his
adhesion to their being so governed, unless after all efforts have been
exhausted to educate them for [[freedom]] and govern them as freemen, and it
has been definitively proved that they can only be governed as [[children]].
the bare statement of the alternative shows the absurdity of supposing
that such efforts have been made in any case which needs be considered
here. it is only because the [[institutions]] of this [[country]] are a mass of
inconsistencies, that things find admittance into our practice which
belong to the [[system]] of despotic, or what is called paternal,
government, while the general [[freedom]] of our [[institutions]] precludes the
exercise of the amount of control necessary to render the restraint of
any real efficacy as a [[moral]] [[education]].

it was pointed out in an early part of this essay, that the [[liberty]] of
the [[individual]], in things wherein the [[individual]] is alone concerned,
implies a corresponding [[liberty]] in any number of individuals [[individual]] to regulate
by mutual agreement such things as regard them jointly, and regard no
persons but themselves. this [[question]] presents [[present]] no difficulty, so long as
the will of all the persons [[person]] implicated remains unaltered; but since that
will may [[change]], it is often necessary, even in things in which they
alone are concerned, that they should enter into engagements with one
another; and when they do, it is fit, as a general [[rule]], that those
engagements should be kept. yet in the laws [[law]], probably, of every [[country]],
this general [[rule]] has some exceptions. not only persons [[person]] are not held to
engagements which violate the rights [[right]] of third parties, but it is
sometimes considered a sufficient [[reason]] for releasing them from an
engagement, that it is injurious to themselves. in this and most other
civilised countries [[country]], for [[example]], an engagement by which a [[person]] should
sell himself, or allow himself to be sold, as a [[slave]], would be null and
void; neither enforced by [[law]] nor by [[opinion]]. the ground for thus
limiting his [[power]] of voluntarily disposing of his own lot in [[life]], is
apparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case. the [[reason]] for
not interfering, unless for the sake of others, with a person's
voluntary acts, is consideration for his [[liberty]]. his voluntary choice
is evidence that what he so chooses is desirable, or at the least
endurable, to him, and his [[good]] is on the whole [[best]] provided for by
allowing him to take his own means of pursuing it. but by selling
himself for a [[slave]], he abdicates his [[liberty]]; he foregoes any future
use of it, beyond that [[single]] act. he therefore defeats, in his own
case, the very [[purpose]] which is the justification of allowing him to
dispose of himself. he is no longer [[free]]; but is thenceforth in a
position which has no longer the presumption in its favour, that would
be afforded by his voluntarily remaining in it. the [[principle]] of freedom
cannot require that he should be [[free]] not to be [[free]]. it is not [[freedom]],
to be allowed to alienate his [[freedom]]. these reasons [[reason]], the [[force]] of which
is so conspicuous in this peculiar case, are evidently of far wider
application; yet a limit is everywhere set to them by the necessities of
life, which continually require, not indeed that we should resign our
freedom, but that we should [[consent]] to this and the other limitation of
it. the [[principle]], however, which demands uncontrolled [[freedom]] of action
in all that concerns only the agents themselves, requires that those who
have become bound to one another, in things which concern no third
party, should be able to release one another from the engagement: and
even without such voluntary release, there are perhaps no contracts or
engagements, except those that relate to [[money]] or money's worth, of
which one can venture to say that there ought to be no [[liberty]] whatever
of retractation. baron wilhelm von humboldt, in the excellent essay from
which i have already quoted, states it as his conviction, that
engagements which involve personal relations or services, should never
be legally binding beyond a limited duration of [[time]]; and that the most
important of these engagements, [[marriage]], having the peculiarity that
its objects are frustrated unless the feelings of both the parties are
in harmony with it, should require nothing more than the declared will
of either party to dissolve it. this [[subject]] is too important, and too
complicated, to be discussed in a parenthesis, and i touch on it only so
far as is necessary for purposes [[purpose]] of illustration. if the conciseness and
generality of baron humboldt's dissertation had not obliged him in this
instance to content himself with enunciating his conclusion without
discussing the premises, he would doubtless have recognised that the
question cannot be decided on grounds so simple as those to which he
confines himself. when a [[person]], either by express promise or by
conduct, has encouraged another to rely upon his continuing to act in a
certain way--to build expectations and calculations, and stake any part
of his plan of [[life]] upon that supposition, a new series of moral
obligations arises on his part towards that [[person]], which may possibly
be overruled, but cannot be ignored. and again, if the relation between
two contracting parties has been followed by consequences to others; if
it has placed third parties in any peculiar position, or, as in the case
of [[marriage]], has even called third parties into existence, obligations
arise on the part of both the contracting parties towards those third
persons, the fulfilment of which, or at all events the mode of
fulfilment, must be greatly affected by the continuance or disruption of
the relation between the original parties to the contract. it does not
follow, nor can i admit, that these obligations extend to requiring the
fulfilment of the contract at all costs to the [[happiness]] of the
reluctant party; but they are a necessary element in the [[question]]; and
even if, as von humboldt maintains, they ought to make no difference in
the _legal_ [[freedom]] of the parties to release themselves from the
engagement (and i also hold that they ought not to make _much_
difference), they necessarily make a [[great]] difference in the _moral_
freedom. a [[person]] is bound to take all these circumstances into account,
before resolving on a step which may affect such important interests of
others; and if he does not allow proper weight to those interests, he is
morally responsible for the [[wrong]]. i have made these obvious remarks for
the [[better]] illustration of the general [[principle]] of [[liberty]], and not
because they are at all needed on the particular [[question]], which, on the
contrary, is usually discussed as if the interest of [[children]] was
everything, and that of grown persons [[person]] nothing.

i have already observed that, owing to the absence of any recognised
general principles [[principle]], [[liberty]] is often granted where it should be
withheld, as well as withheld where it should be granted; and one of the
cases in which, in the [[modern]] [[european]] [[world]], the sentiment of liberty
is the strongest, is a case where, in my view, it is altogether
misplaced. a [[person]] should be [[free]] to do as he likes in his own
concerns; but he ought not to be [[free]] to do as he likes in acting for
another, under the pretext that the affairs of another are his own
affairs. the [[state]], while it respects [[respect]] the [[liberty]] of each in what
specially regards himself, is bound to maintain a vigilant control over
his exercise of any [[power]] which it allows him to possess over others.
this obligation is almost entirely disregarded in the case of the
family relations, a case, in its direct influence on [[human]] [[happiness]],
more important than all others taken together. the almost despotic power
of husbands over wives [[wife]] need not be enlarged upon here because nothing
more is needed for the complete removal of the [[evil]], than that wives
should have the same rights [[right]], and should receive the protection of [[law]] in
the same manner, as all other persons [[person]]; and because, on this [[subject]], the
defenders of established [[injustice]] do not avail themselves of the plea
of [[liberty]], but stand forth openly as the champions of [[power]]. it is in
the case of [[children]], that misapplied notions of [[liberty]] are a real
obstacle to the fulfilment by the [[state]] of its duties [[duty]]. one would almost
think that a man's [[man]] [[children]] were supposed to be literally, and not
metaphorically, a part of himself, so [[jealous]] is [[opinion]] of the smallest
interference of [[law]] with his absolute and exclusive control over them;
more [[jealous]] than of almost any interference with his own [[freedom]] of
action: so much less do the generality of [[mankind]] value [[liberty]] than
power. consider, for [[example]], the case of [[education]]. is it not almost a
self-evident axiom, that the [[state]] should require and compel the
education, up to a [[certain]] standard, of every [[human]] being who is born
its citizen? yet who is there that is not afraid to recognise and
assert this [[truth]]? hardly any one indeed will deny that it is one of the
most [[sacred]] duties [[duty]] of the parents (or, as [[law]] and usage now stand, the
father), after summoning a [[human]] being into the [[world]], to give to that
being an [[education]] fitting him to perform his part well in [[life]] towards
others and towards himself. but while this is unanimously declared to be
the father's [[duty]], scarcely anybody, in this [[country]], will bear to hear
of obliging him to perform it. instead of his being required to make any
exertion or [[sacrifice]] for securing [[education]] to the child, it is left to
his [[choice]] to accept it or not when it is provided gratis! it still
remains unrecognised, that to bring a child into existence without a
fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its [[body]], but
instruction and training for its [[mind]], is a [[moral]] crime, both against
the unfortunate offspring and against [[society]]; and that if the parent
does not fulfil this obligation, the [[state]] ought to see it fulfilled, at
the charge, as far as possible, of the parent.

were the [[duty]] of enforcing universal [[education]] once admitted, there
would be an end to the difficulties about what the [[state]] should [[teach]],
and how it should [[teach]], which now convert the [[subject]] into a mere
battle-field for sects and parties, causing the [[time]] and [[labour]] which
should have been spent in educating, to be wasted in quarrelling about
education. if the [[government]] would make up its [[mind]] to _require_ for
every child a [[good]] [[education]], it might save itself the trouble of
_providing_ one. it might leave to parents to obtain the [[education]] where
and how they pleased, and content itself with helping to [[pay]] the school
fees of the poorer class of [[children]], and defraying the entire school
expenses of those who have no one else to [[pay]] for them. the objections
which are urged with [[reason]] against [[state]] [[education]], do not apply to the
enforcement of [[education]] by the [[state]], but to the state's taking upon
itself to direct that [[education]]; which is a totally different thing.
that the whole or any large part of the [[education]] of the [[people]] should
be in [[state]] hands, i go as far as any one in deprecating. all that has
been said of the importance of individuality of [[character]], and diversity
in opinions [[opinion]] and modes of conduct, involves, as of the same unspeakable
importance, [[diversity]] of [[education]]. a general [[state]] [[education]] is a mere
contrivance for moulding [[people]] to be exactly like one another; and as
the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant
power in the [[government]], whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, an
aristocracy, or the majority of the existing [[generation]], in proportion
as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the
mind, leading by [[natural]] tendency to one over the [[body]]. an education
established and controlled by the [[state]], should only [[exist]], if it exist
at all, as one among many competing experiments, carried on for the
purpose of [[example]] and stimulus, to keep the others up to a certain
standard of excellence. unless, indeed, when [[society]] in general is in so
backward a [[state]] that it could not or would not provide for itself any
proper [[institutions]] of [[education]], unless the [[government]] undertook the
task; then, indeed, the [[government]] may, as the less of two [[great]] evils [[evil]],
take upon itself the [[business]] of schools and universities [[university]], as it may
that of joint stock companies, when private enterprise, in a shape
fitted for undertaking [[great]] works [[work]] of industry, does not [[exist]] in the
country. but in general, if the [[country]] contains a sufficient number of
persons qualified to provide [[education]] under [[government]] auspices, the
same persons [[person]] would be able and willing to give an equally [[good]] education
on the voluntary [[principle]], under the assurance of remuneration afforded
by a [[law]] rendering [[education]] compulsory, combined with [[state]] aid to
those unable to defray the expense.

the instrument for enforcing the [[law]] could be no other than public
examinations, extending to all [[children]], and beginning at an early [[age]].
an [[age]] might be fixed at which every child must be examined, to
ascertain if he (or she) is able to [[read]]. if a child proves unable, the
father, unless he has some sufficient ground of excuse, might be
subjected to a moderate fine, to be worked out, if necessary, by his
labour, and the child might be put to school at his expense. once in
every year the examination should be renewed, with a gradually extending
range of subjects [[subject]], so as to make the universal acquisition, and what is
more, retention, of a [[certain]] minimum of general [[knowledge]], virtually
compulsory. beyond that minimum, there should be voluntary examinations
on all subjects [[subject]], at which all who come up to a [[certain]] standard of
proficiency might claim a certificate. to prevent the [[state]] from
exercising, through these arrangements, an improper influence over
opinion, the [[knowledge]] required for passing an examination (beyond the
merely instrumental parts of [[knowledge]], such as languages [[language]] and their use)
should, even in the higher class of examinations, be confined to facts
and positive [[science]] exclusively. the examinations on [[religion]],
politics, or other disputed topics, should not turn on the [[truth]] or
falsehood of opinions [[opinion]], but on the matter of [[fact]] that such and such an
opinion is held, on such grounds, by such authors, or schools, or
churches. under this [[system]], the rising [[generation]] would be no worse off
in regard to all disputed truths [[truth]], than they are at [[present]]; they would
be brought up either churchmen or dissenters as they now are, the state
merely taking [[care]] that they should be instructed churchmen, or
instructed dissenters. there would be nothing to hinder them from being
taught [[religion]], if their parents chose, at the same schools where they
were taught other things. all attempts by the [[state]] to bias the
conclusions of its [[citizens]] on disputed subjects [[subject]], are [[evil]]; but it may
very properly offer to ascertain and certify that a [[person]] possesses the
knowledge, requisite to make his conclusions, on any given [[subject]],
worth attending to. a student of [[philosophy]] would be the [[better]] for
being able to stand an examination both in locke and in kant, whichever
of the two he takes up with, or even if with neither: and there is no
reasonable objection to examining an atheist in the evidences of
christianity, provided he is not required to profess a [[belief]] in them.
the examinations, however, in the higher branches of [[knowledge]] should, i
conceive, be entirely voluntary. it would be giving too dangerous a
power to governments [[government]], were they allowed to exclude any one from
professions, even from the profession of teacher, for alleged deficiency
of qualifications: and i [[think]], with wilhelm von humboldt, that degrees [[degree]],
or other [[public]] certificates of scientific or professional acquirements,
should be given to all who [[present]] themselves for examination, and stand
the test; but that such certificates should confer no advantage over
competitors, other than the weight which may be attached to their
testimony by [[public]] [[opinion]].

it is not in the matter of [[education]] only, that misplaced notions of
liberty prevent [[moral]] obligations on the part of parents from being
recognised, and legal obligations from being imposed, where there are
the strongest grounds for the former always, and in many cases for the
latter also. the [[fact]] itself, of causing the existence of a [[human]] being,
is one of the most responsible actions in the range of [[human]] [[life]]. to
undertake this responsibility--to bestow a [[life]] which may be either a
curse or a blessing--unless the being on whom it is to be bestowed will
have at least the ordinary chances [[chance]] of a desirable existence, is a crime
against that being. and in a [[country]] either over-peopled, or threatened
with being so, to [[produce]] [[children]], beyond a very small number, with
the effect of reducing the [[reward]] of [[labour]] by their competition, is a
serious offence against all who [[live]] by the remuneration of their
labour. the laws [[law]] which, in many countries [[country]] on the continent, forbid
marriage unless the parties can show that they have the means of
supporting a [[family]], do not exceed the legitimate powers [[power]] of the [[state]]:
and whether such laws [[law]] be expedient or not (a [[question]] mainly dependent
on local circumstances and feelings), they are not objectionable as
violations of [[liberty]]. such laws [[law]] are interferences of the [[state]] to
prohibit a mischievous act--an act injurious to others, which ought to
be a [[subject]] of reprobation, and social stigma, even when it is not
deemed expedient to superadd legal [[punishment]]. yet the current ideas [[idea]] of
liberty, which bend so easily to real infringements of the [[freedom]] of
the [[individual]], in things which concern only himself, would repel the
attempt to put any restraint upon his inclinations when the consequence
of their indulgence is a [[life]], or lives [[life]], of wretchedness and depravity
to the offspring, with manifold evils [[evil]] to those sufficiently within reach
to be in any way affected by their actions. when we compare the strange
respect of [[mankind]] for [[liberty]], with their [[strange]] want of [[respect]] for
it, we might imagine that a [[man]] had an indispensable [[right]] to do harm
to others, and no [[right]] at all to please himself without giving [[pain]] to
any one.

i have reserved for the [[last]] place a large class of questions [[question]] respecting
the limits of [[government]] interference, which, though closely connected
with the [[subject]] of this essay, do not, in strictness, belong to it.
these are cases in which the reasons [[reason]] against interference do not turn
upon the [[principle]] of [[liberty]]: the [[question]] is not about restraining the
actions of individuals [[individual]], but about helping them: it is [[asked]] whether the
government should do, or cause to be done, something for their benefit,
instead of leaving it to be done by themselves, individually, or in
voluntary combination.

the objections to [[government]] interference, when it is not such as to
involve infringement of [[liberty]], may be of three kinds [[kind]].

the first is, when the thing to be done is likely to be [[better]] done by
individuals than by the [[government]]. speaking generally, there is no one
so fit to conduct any [[business]], or to determine how or by whom it shall
be conducted, as those who are personally interested in it. this
principle condemns the interferences, once so [[common]], of the
legislature, or the officers of [[government]], with the ordinary processes
of industry. but this part of the [[subject]] has been sufficiently enlarged
upon by [[political]] economists, and is not particularly related to the
principles of this essay.

the second objection is more nearly allied to our [[subject]]. in many
cases, though individuals [[individual]] may not do the particular thing so well, on
the average, as the officers of [[government]], it is nevertheless desirable
that it should be done by them, rather than by the [[government]], as a
means to their own mental education--a mode of strengthening their
active faculties, exercising their [[judgment]], and giving them a familiar
knowledge of the subjects [[subject]] with which they are thus left to deal. this is
a principal, though not the sole, recommendation of jury [[trial]] (in cases
not political); of [[free]] and popular local and municipal [[institutions]]; of
the conduct of industrial and philanthropic enterprises by voluntary
associations. these are not questions [[question]] of [[liberty]], and are connected with
that [[subject]] only by remote tendencies; but they are questions [[question]] of
development. it belongs to a different [[occasion]] from the [[present]] to
dwell on these things as parts of national [[education]]; as being, in
truth, the peculiar training of a citizen, the practical part of the
political [[education]] of a [[free]] [[people]], taking them out of the narrow
circle of personal and [[family]] selfishness, and accustoming them to the
comprehension of joint interests, the management of joint
concerns--habituating them to act from [[public]] or semi-public motives,
and guide their conduct by aims which unite instead of isolating them
from one another. without these habits and powers [[power]], a [[free]] constitution
can neither be worked nor preserved, as is exemplified by the too-often
transitory [[nature]] of [[political]] [[freedom]] in countries [[country]] where it does not
rest upon a sufficient basis of local liberties [[liberty]]. the management of
purely local [[business]] by the localities, and of the [[great]] enterprises of
industry by the union of those who voluntarily supply the pecuniary
means, is further recommended by all the advantages which have been set
forth in this essay as belonging to individuality of [[development]], and
diversity of modes of action. [[government]] operations tend to be
everywhere alike. with individuals [[individual]] and voluntary associations, on the
contrary, there are varied experiments, and endless [[diversity]] of
experience. what the [[state]] can usefully do, is to make itself a central
depository, and active circulator and diffuser, of the experience
resulting from many trials. its [[business]] is to enable each
experimentalist to benefit by the experiments of others, instead of
tolerating no experiments but its own.

the third, and most cogent [[reason]] for restricting the interference of
government, is the [[great]] [[evil]] of adding unnecessarily to its [[power]].
every function superadded to those already exercised by the [[government]],
causes its influence over hopes [[hope]] and fears [[fear]] to be more widely diffused,
and converts, more and more, the active and ambitious part of the public
into hangers-on of the [[government]], or of some party which aims at
becoming the [[government]]. if the roads, the railways, the banks, the
insurance offices, the [[great]] joint-stock companies, the universities [[university]],
and the [[public]] charities, were all of them branches of the [[government]];
if, in addition, the municipal corporations and local boards, with all
that now devolves on them, became departments of the central
administration; if the employés of all these different enterprises were
appointed and paid by the [[government]], and looked to the [[government]] for
every rise in [[life]]; not all the [[freedom]] of the press and popular
constitution of the legislature would make this or any other country
free otherwise than in name. and the [[evil]] would be greater, the more
efficiently and scientifically the administrative machinery was
constructed--the more skilful the arrangements for obtaining the best
qualified hands and heads with which to [[work]] it. in [[england]] it has of
late been proposed that all the members of the civil service of
government should be selected by competitive examination, to obtain for
those employments the most [[intelligent]] and instructed persons
procurable; and much has been said and written for and against this
proposal. one of the arguments most insisted on by its opponents, is
that the occupation of a permanent official servant of the [[state]] does
not hold out sufficient prospects of emolument and importance to attract
the highest [[talents]], which will always be able to find a more inviting
career in the professions, or in the service of companies and other
public bodies [[body]]. one would not have been surprised if this argument had
been used by the [[friends]] of the proposition, as an [[answer]] to its
principal difficulty. coming from the opponents it is [[strange]] enough.
what is urged as an objection is the safety-valve of the proposed
system. if indeed all the high talent of the [[country]] _could_ be drawn
into the service of the [[government]], a proposal tending to bring about
that result might well inspire uneasiness. if every part of the business
of [[society]] which required organised concert, or large and comprehensive
views, were in the hands of the [[government]], and if [[government]] offices
were universally filled by the ablest [[men]], all the enlarged [[culture]] and
practised [[intelligence]] in the [[country]], except the purely speculative,
would be concentrated in a numerous bureaucracy, to whom alone the rest
of the [[community]] would look for all things: the multitude for direction
and dictation in all they had to do; the able and aspiring for personal
advancement. to be admitted into the ranks of this bureaucracy, and when
admitted, to rise therein, would be the sole objects of [[ambition]]. under
this régime, not only is the outside [[public]] ill-qualified, for want of
practical [[experience]], to criticise or check the mode of operation of the
bureaucracy, but even if the accidents of despotic or the natural
working of popular [[institutions]] occasionally raise to the summit a ruler
or rulers of reforming inclinations, no reform can be effected which is
contrary to the interest of the bureaucracy. such is the melancholy
condition of the russian [[empire]], as is shown in the accounts of those
who have had sufficient opportunity of observation. the czar himself is
powerless against the bureaucratic [[body]]; he can send any one of them to
siberia, but he cannot govern without them, or against their will. on
every decree of his they have a tacit veto, by merely refraining from
carrying it into effect. in countries [[country]] of more advanced civilisation and
of a more insurrectionary spirit, the [[public]], accustomed to expect
everything to be done for them by the [[state]], or at least to do nothing
for themselves without asking from the [[state]] not only leave to do it,
but even how it is to be done, naturally hold the [[state]] responsible for
all [[evil]] which befalls them, and when the [[evil]] exceeds their amount of
patience, they rise against the [[government]] and make what is called a
revolution; whereupon somebody else, with or without legitimate
authority from the nation, vaults into the seat, issues his orders to
the bureaucracy, and everything goes on much as it did before; the
bureaucracy being unchanged, and nobody else being capable of taking
their place.

a very different spectacle is exhibited among a [[people]] accustomed to
transact their own [[business]]. in [[france]], a large part of the people
having been engaged in [[military]] service, many of whom have held at least
the rank of non-commissioned officers, there are in every popular
insurrection several persons [[person]] competent to take the lead, and improvise
some tolerable plan of action. what the french are in [[military]] affairs,
the americans are in every [[kind]] of civil [[business]]; let them be left
without a [[government]], every [[body]] of americans is able to improvise one,
and to carry on that or any other [[public]] [[business]] with a sufficient
amount of [[intelligence]], order, and decision. this is what every free
people ought to be: and a [[people]] capable of this is [[certain]] to be [[free]];
it will never let itself be enslaved by any [[man]] or [[body]] of [[men]] because
these are able to seize and pull the reins of the central
administration. no bureaucracy can [[hope]] to make such a [[people]] as this do
or undergo anything that they do not like. but where everything is done
through the bureaucracy, nothing to which the bureaucracy is really
adverse can be done at all. the [[constitution]] of such countries [[country]] is an
organisation of the [[experience]] and practical ability of the nation, into
a disciplined [[body]] for the [[purpose]] of governing the rest; and the more
perfect that organisation is in itself, the more successful in drawing
to itself and educating for itself the persons [[person]] of [[greatest]] capacity from
all ranks of the [[community]], the more complete is the bondage of all, the
members of the bureaucracy included. for the governors are as much the
slaves of their organisation and discipline, as the governed are of the
governors. a chinese mandarin is as much the tool and creature of a
despotism as the humblest cultivator. an [[individual]] jesuit is to the
utmost [[degree]] of abasement the [[slave]] of his order, though the order
itself exists for the collective [[power]] and importance of its members.

it is not, also, to be forgotten, that the absorption of all the
principal ability of the [[country]] into the governing [[body]] is fatal,
sooner or later, to the mental activity and progressiveness of the body
itself. banded together as they are--working a [[system]] which, like all
systems, necessarily proceeds in a [[great]] measure by fixed rules--the
official [[body]] are under the constant temptation of sinking into indolent
routine, or, if they now and then desert that mill-horse round, of
rushing into some half-examined crudity which has struck the fancy of
some leading member of the corps: and the sole check to these closely
allied, though seemingly opposite, tendencies, the only stimulus which
can keep the ability of the [[body]] itself up to a high standard, is
liability to the watchful criticism of [[equal]] ability outside the [[body]].
it is indispensable, therefore, that the means should [[exist]],
independently of the [[government]], of forming such ability, and furnishing
it with the opportunities and [[experience]] necessary for a correct
judgment of [[great]] practical affairs. if we would possess permanently a
skilful and efficient [[body]] of functionaries--above all, a [[body]] able to
originate and willing to adopt improvements; if we would not have our
bureaucracy degenerate into a pedantocracy, this [[body]] must not engross
all the occupations which form and cultivate the faculties required for
the [[government]] of [[mankind]].

to determine the point at which evils [[evil]], so formidable to [[human]] freedom
and advancement, begin, or rather at which they begin to predominate
over the benefits attending the collective application of the [[force]] of
society, under its recognised chiefs [[chief]], for the removal of the obstacles
which stand in the way of its well-being; to secure as much of the
advantages of centralised [[power]] and [[intelligence]], as can be had without
turning into governmental channels too [[great]] a proportion of the general
activity, is one of the most difficult and complicated questions [[question]] in the
art of [[government]]. it is, in a [[great]] measure, a [[question]] of detail, in
which many and various considerations must be kept in view, and no
absolute [[rule]] can be laid down. but i [[believe]] that the practical
principle in which safety resides, the ideal to be kept in view, the
standard by which to test all arrangements intended for overcoming the
difficulty, may be conveyed in these words: the [[greatest]] dissemination
of [[power]] consistent with efficiency; but the [[greatest]] possible
centralisation of information, and diffusion of it from the centre.
thus, in municipal administration, there would be, as in the new england
states, a very minute division among separate officers, chosen by the
localities, of all [[business]] which is not [[better]] left to the persons
directly interested; but besides this, there would be, in each
department of local affairs, a central superintendence, forming a branch
of the general [[government]]. the organ of this superintendence would
concentrate, as in a focus, the variety of information and experience
derived from the conduct of that branch of [[public]] [[business]] in all the
localities, from everything analogous which is done in foreign
countries, and from the general principles [[principle]] of [[political]] [[science]]. this
central organ should have a [[right]] to [[know]] all that is done, and its
special [[duty]] should be that of making the [[knowledge]] acquired in one
place available for others. emancipated from the petty prejudices and
narrow views of a locality by its elevated position and comprehensive
sphere of observation, its [[advice]] would naturally carry much [[authority]];
but its actual [[power]], as a permanent institution, should, i conceive, be
limited to compelling the local officers to obey the laws [[law]] laid down for
their guidance. in all things not provided for by general rules [[rule]], those
officers should be left to their own [[judgment]], under responsibility to
their constituents. for the violation of rules [[rule]], they should be
responsible to [[law]], and the rules [[rule]] themselves should be laid down by the
legislature; the central administrative [[authority]] only watching over
their execution, and if they were not properly carried into effect,
appealing, according to the [[nature]] of the case, to the tribunal to
enforce the [[law]], or to the constituencies to dismiss the functionaries
who had not executed it according to its spirit. such, in its general
conception, is the central superintendence which the [[poor]] [[law]] board is
intended to exercise over the administrators of the [[poor]] rate throughout
the [[country]]. whatever powers [[power]] the board exercises beyond this limit, were
right and necessary in that peculiar case, for the cure of rooted habits
of maladministration in matters deeply affecting not the localities
merely, but the whole [[community]]; since no locality has a [[moral]] [[right]] to
make itself by mismanagement a nest of pauperism, necessarily
overflowing into other localities, and impairing the [[moral]] and physical
condition of the whole labouring [[community]]. the powers [[power]] of administrative
coercion and subordinate legislation possessed by the [[poor]] [[law]] board
(but which, owing to the [[state]] of [[opinion]] on the [[subject]], are very
scantily exercised by them), though perfectly justifiable in a case of
first-rate national interest, would be wholly out of place in the
superintendence of interests purely local. but a central organ of
information and instruction for all the localities, would be equally
valuable in all departments of administration. a [[government]] cannot have
too much of the [[kind]] of activity which does not impede, but aids and
stimulates, [[individual]] exertion and [[development]]. the mischief begins
when, instead of calling forth the activity and powers [[power]] of individuals
and bodies [[body]], it substitutes its own activity for theirs; when, instead of
informing, advising, and, upon [[occasion]], denouncing, it makes them work
in fetters, or bids them stand aside and does their [[work]] instead of
them. the worth of a [[state]], in the long run, is the worth of the
individuals composing it; and a [[state]] which postpones the interests of
_their_ mental expansion and elevation, to a little more of
administrative [[skill]], or of that semblance of it which practice gives,
in the details of [[business]]; a [[state]] which dwarfs its [[men]], in order that
they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial
purposes, will find that with small [[men]] no [[great]] thing can really be
accomplished; and that the [[perfection]] of machinery to which it has
sacrificed everything, will in the end avail it nothing, for want of the
vital [[power]] which, in order that the machine might [[work]] more smoothly,
it has preferred to banish.
