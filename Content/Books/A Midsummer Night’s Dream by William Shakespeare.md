act i

scene i. [[athens]]. a room in the palace of theseus

 enter theseus, hippolyta, philostrate and attendants.

theseus.
now, [[fair]] hippolyta, our nuptial hour
draws on apace; four [[happy]] days bring in
another moon; but oh, methinks, how slow
this old moon wanes! she lingers my desires [[desire]],
like to a step-dame or a dowager,
long withering out a [[young]] man’s [[revenue]].

hippolyta.
four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
four nights will quickly [[dream]] away the [[time]];
and then the moon, like to a silver bow
new bent in [[heaven]], shall behold the night
of our solemnities.

theseus.
go, philostrate,
stir up the athenian [[youth]] to merriments;
awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
turn melancholy forth to funerals;
the pale companion is not for our pomp.

 [_exit philostrate._]

hippolyta, i woo’d thee with my [[sword]],
and won thy [[love]] doing thee injuries;
but i will wed thee in another key,
with pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.

 enter egeus, hermia, lysander and demetrius.

egeus.
happy be theseus, our renownèd duke!

theseus.
thanks, [[good]] egeus. what’s the news with thee?

egeus.
full of vexation come i, with complaint
against my child, my [[daughter]] hermia.
stand forth, demetrius. my [[noble]] [[lord]],
this [[man]] hath my [[consent]] to [[marry]] her.
stand forth, lysander. and, my gracious duke,
this [[man]] hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.
thou, thou, lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
and interchang’d love-tokens with my child.
thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
with feigning voice, verses of feigning [[love]];
and stol’n the impression of her fantasy
with bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,
knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers
of [[strong]] prevailment in unharden’d youth)
with cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s [[heart]],
turn’d her [[obedience]] (which is due to me)
to stubborn harshness. and, my gracious duke,
be it so she will not here before your grace
consent to [[marry]] with demetrius,
i beg the ancient [[privilege]] of [[athens]]:
as she is mine i may dispose of her;
which shall be either to this gentleman
or to her [[death]], according to our law
immediately provided in that case.

theseus.
what say you, hermia? be advis’d, [[fair]] maid.
to you your [[father]] should be as a [[god]];
one that compos’d your beauties [[beauty]], yea, and one
to whom you are but as a form in wax
by him imprinted, and within his power
to leave the figure, or disfigure it.
demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

hermia.
so is lysander.

theseus.
in himself he is.
but in this [[kind]], wanting your father’s voice,
the other must be held the worthier.

hermia.
i would my [[father]] look’d but with my [[eyes]].

theseus.
rather your [[eyes]] must with his [[judgment]] look.

hermia.
i do entreat your grace to pardon me.
i [[know]] not by what [[power]] i am made bold,
nor how it may concern my modesty
in such a presence here to plead my thoughts [[thought]]:
but i beseech your grace that i may know
the worst that may befall me in this case,
if i refuse to wed demetrius.

theseus.
either to [[die]] the [[death]], or to abjure
for ever the [[society]] of [[men]].
therefore, [[fair]] hermia, [[question]] your desires [[desire]],
know of your [[youth]], examine well your [[blood]],
whether, if you yield not to your father’s [[choice]],
you can endure the livery of a nun,
for aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,
to [[live]] a barren sister all your [[life]],
chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood
to undergo such maiden pilgrimage,
but earthlier [[happy]] is the rose distill’d
than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,
grows, lives [[life]], and dies, in [[single]] blessedness.

hermia.
so will i grow, so [[live]], so [[die]], my [[lord]],
ere i will yield my virgin patent up
unto his lordship, whose unwishèd yoke
my [[soul]] consents not to give sovereignty.

theseus.
take [[time]] to pause; and by the next new moon
the sealing-day betwixt my [[love]] and me
for everlasting bond of fellowship,
upon that day either prepare to die
for disobedience to your father’s will,
or else to wed demetrius, as he would,
or on diana’s altar to protest
for aye austerity and [[single]] [[life]].

demetrius.
relent, sweet hermia; and, lysander, yield
thy crazèd title to my [[certain]] [[right]].

lysander.
you have her father’s [[love]], demetrius.
let me have hermia’s. do you [[marry]] him.

egeus.
scornful lysander, true, he hath my [[love]];
and what is mine my [[love]] shall render him;
and she is mine, and all my [[right]] of her
i do estate unto demetrius.

lysander.
i am, my [[lord]], as well deriv’d as he,
as well possess’d; my [[love]] is more than his;
my fortunes [[fortune]] every way as fairly rank’d,
if not with vantage, as demetrius’;
and, which is more than all these boasts can be,
i am belov’d of beauteous hermia.
why should not i then prosecute my [[right]]?
demetrius, i’ll avouch it to his head,
made [[love]] to nedar’s [[daughter]], helena,
and won her [[soul]]; and she, sweet [[lady]], dotes,
devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
upon this spotted and inconstant [[man]].

theseus.
i must confess that i have heard so much,
and with demetrius [[thought]] to have spoke thereof;
but, being over-full of self-affairs,
my [[mind]] did lose it.—but, demetrius, come,
and come, egeus; you shall go with me.
i have some private schooling for you both.—
for you, [[fair]] hermia, look you arm yourself
to fit your fancies to your father’s will,
or else the [[law]] of [[athens]] yields you up
(which by no means we may extenuate)
to [[death]], or to a vow of [[single]] [[life]].
come, my hippolyta. what cheer, my [[love]]?
demetrius and egeus, go along;
i must employ you in some business
against our nuptial, and confer with you
of something nearly that concerns yourselves.

egeus.
with [[duty]] and [[desire]] we [[follow]] you.

 [_exeunt all but lysander and hermia._]

lysander.
how now, my [[love]]? why is your cheek so pale?
how [[chance]] the roses there do fade so fast?

hermia.
belike for want of rain, which i could well
beteem them from the tempest of my [[eyes]].

lysander.
ay me! for aught that i could ever [[read]],
could ever hear by tale or [[history]],
the course of true [[love]] never did run smooth.
but either it was different in blood—

hermia.
o cross! too high to be enthrall’d to low.

lysander.
or else misgraffèd in [[respect]] of years—

hermia.
o spite! too old to be engag’d to [[young]].

lysander.
or else it stood upon the [[choice]] of friends—

hermia.
o hell! to choose [[love]] by another’s eyes!

lysander.
or, if there were a sympathy in [[choice]],
war, [[death]], or sickness did lay siege to it,
making it momentany as a sound,
swift as a shadow, short as any [[dream]],
brief as the lightning in the collied night
that, in a spleen, unfolds both [[heaven]] and [[earth]],
and, ere a [[man]] hath [[power]] to say, ‘behold!’
the jaws of darkness do devour it up:
so quick bright things come to confusion.

hermia.
if then true lovers have ever cross’d,
it stands as an edict in [[destiny]].
then let us [[teach]] our [[trial]] patience,
because it is a customary cross,
as due to [[love]] as thoughts [[thought]] and dreams [[dream]] and sighs,
wishes and tears, [[poor]] fancy’s followers.

lysander.
a [[good]] persuasion; therefore, hear me, hermia.
i have a widow aunt, a dowager
of [[great]] [[revenue]], and she hath no child.
from [[athens]] is her house remote seven leagues,
and she respects [[respect]] me as her only [[son]].
there, gentle hermia, may i [[marry]] thee,
and to that place the sharp athenian law
cannot pursue us. if thou lovest me then,
steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;
and in the wood, a league without the town
(where i did meet thee once with helena
to do observance to a morn of may),
there will i stay for thee.

hermia.
my [[good]] lysander!
i swear to thee by cupid’s strongest bow,
by his [[best]] arrow with the golden head,
by the simplicity of venus’ doves,
by that which knitteth souls [[soul]] and prospers loves [[love]],
and by that [[fire]] which burn’d the [[carthage]] queen
when the false trojan under sail was seen,
by all the vows that ever [[men]] have broke
(in number more than ever [[women]] spoke),
in that same place thou hast appointed me,
tomorrow truly will i meet with thee.

lysander.
keep promise, [[love]]. look, here comes helena.

 enter helena.

hermia.
god speed [[fair]] helena! whither away?

helena.
call you me [[fair]]? that [[fair]] again unsay.
demetrius loves [[love]] your [[fair]]. o [[happy]] fair!
your [[eyes]] are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air
more tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,
when wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
sickness is catching. o were favour so,
yours would i catch, [[fair]] hermia, ere i go.
my ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
my tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.
were the [[world]] mine, demetrius being bated,
the rest i’d give to be to you translated.
o, [[teach]] me how you look, and with what art
you sway the motion of demetrius’ heart!

hermia.
i frown upon him, yet he loves [[love]] me still.

helena.
o that your frowns would [[teach]] my smiles such skill!

hermia.
i give him curses, yet he gives me [[love]].

helena.
o that my prayers could such affection move!

hermia.
the more i hate, the more he follows me.

helena.
the more i [[love]], the more he hateth me.

hermia.
his folly, helena, is no [[fault]] of mine.

helena.
none but your [[beauty]]; would that [[fault]] were mine!

hermia.
take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
lysander and myself will fly this place.
before the [[time]] i did lysander see,
seem’d [[athens]] as a paradise to me.
o, then, what graces in my [[love]] do dwell,
that he hath turn’d a [[heaven]] into hell!

lysander.
helen, to you our minds [[mind]] we will unfold:
tomorrow night, when phoebe doth behold
her silver visage in the watery glass,
decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
(a [[time]] that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),
through athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.

hermia.
and in the wood where often you and i
upon faint primrose beds were wont to [[lie]],
emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
there my lysander and myself shall meet,
and thence from [[athens]] turn away our [[eyes]],
to seek new [[friends]] and stranger companies.
farewell, sweet playfellow. [[pray]] thou for us,
and [[good]] [[luck]] grant thee thy demetrius!
keep word, lysander. we must starve our sight
from lovers’ food, till morrow deep midnight.

lysander.
i will, my hermia.

 [_exit hermia._]

helena, adieu.
as you on him, demetrius dote on you!

 [_exit lysander._]

helena.
how [[happy]] some o’er other some can be!
through [[athens]] i am [[thought]] as [[fair]] as she.
but what of that? demetrius thinks [[think]] not so;
he will not [[know]] what all but he do [[know]].
and as he errs, doting on hermia’s [[eyes]],
so i, admiring of his qualities.
things base and vile, holding no quantity,
love can transpose to form and [[dignity]].
love looks not with the [[eyes]], but with the [[mind]];
and therefore is wing’d cupid painted blind.
nor hath love’s [[mind]] of any [[judgment]] taste.
wings, and no [[eyes]], figure unheedy haste.
and therefore is [[love]] said to be a child,
because in [[choice]] he is so oft beguil’d.
as waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
so the boy [[love]] is perjur’d everywhere.
for, ere demetrius look’d on hermia’s eyne,
he hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;
and when this hail some heat from hermia [[felt]],
so he dissolv’d, and showers of oaths did melt.
i will go tell him of [[fair]] hermia’s flight.
then to the wood will he tomorrow night
pursue her; and for this intelligence
if i have thanks, it is a dear expense.
but herein mean i to enrich my [[pain]],
to have his sight thither and back again.

 [_exit helena._]


scene ii. the same. a room in a cottage

 enter quince, snug, bottom, flute, snout  and starveling.

quince.
is all our company here?

bottom.
you were [[best]] to call them generally, [[man]] by [[man]], according to the
scrip.

quince.
here is the scroll of every man’s name, which is [[thought]] fit through
all [[athens]], to play in our interlude before the duke and duchess, on
his wedding-day at night.

bottom.
first, [[good]] peter quince, say what the play treats on; then [[read]] the
names of the actors; and so grow to a point.

quince.
marry, our play is _the most lamentable comedy and most cruel [[death]] of
pyramus and thisbe_.

bottom.
a very [[good]] piece of [[work]], i assure you, and a merry. now, [[good]] peter
quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. masters, spread
yourselves.

quince.
answer, as i call you. nick bottom, the weaver.

bottom.
ready. name what part i am for, and proceed.

quince.
you, nick bottom, are set down for pyramus.

bottom.
what is pyramus—a lover, or a [[tyrant]]?

quince.
a lover, that kills himself most gallantly for [[love]].

bottom.
that will ask some tears in the true performing of it. if i do it, let
the audience look to their [[eyes]]. i will move storms; i will condole in
some measure. to the rest—yet my [[chief]] [[humour]] is for a [[tyrant]]. i could
play ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.

    the raging rocks
    and shivering shocks
    shall break the locks
           of prison gates,
    and phibbus’ car
    shall shine from far,
    and make and mar
           the foolish fates [[fate]].

this was lofty. now name the rest of the players. this is ercles’ vein,
a tyrant’s vein; a lover is more condoling.

quince.
francis flute, the bellows-mender.

flute.
here, peter quince.

quince.
flute, you must take thisbe on you.

flute.
what is thisbe? a wandering knight?

quince.
it is the [[lady]] that pyramus must [[love]].

flute.
nay, [[faith]], let not me play a woman. i have a beard coming.

quince.
that’s all one. you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small
as you will.

bottom.
and i may hide my face, let me play thisbe too. i’ll speak in a
monstrous little voice; ‘thisne, thisne!’—‘ah, pyramus, my lover dear!
thy thisbe dear! and [[lady]] dear!’

quince.
no, no, you must play pyramus; and, flute, you thisbe.

bottom.
well, proceed.

quince.
robin starveling, the tailor.

starveling.
here, peter quince.

quince.
robin starveling, you must play thisbe’s [[mother]].
tom snout, the tinker.

snout
here, peter quince.

quince.
you, pyramus’ [[father]]; myself, thisbe’s [[father]];
snug, the joiner, you, the lion’s part. and, i [[hope]] here is a play
fitted.

snug
have you the lion’s part written? [[pray]] you, if it be, give it me, for i
am slow of study.

quince.
you may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.

bottom.
let me play the lion too. i will roar that i will do any man’s heart
good to hear me. i will roar that i will make the duke say ‘let him
roar again, let him roar again.’

quince.
if you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the
ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.

all
that would hang us every mother’s [[son]].

bottom.
i grant you, [[friends]], if you should fright the ladies [[lady]] out of their
wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us. but i will
aggravate my voice so, that i will roar you as gently as any sucking
dove; i will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.

quince.
you can play no part but pyramus, for pyramus is a sweet-faced [[man]]; a
proper [[man]] as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely
gentleman-like [[man]]. therefore you must needs play pyramus.

bottom.
well, i will undertake it. what beard were i [[best]] to play it in?

quince.
why, what you will.

bottom.
i will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your
orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your
french-crown-colour beard, your [[perfect]] yellow.

quince.
some of your french crowns [[crown]] have no hair at all, and then you will play
bare-faced. but, masters, here are your parts, and i am to entreat you,
request you, and [[desire]] you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me
in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will
we rehearse, for if we meet in the [[city]], we shall be dogg’d with
company, and our devices known. in the meantime i will draw a bill of
properties, such as our play wants. i [[pray]] you fail me not.

bottom.
we will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and
courageously. take pains [[pain]], be [[perfect]]; adieu.

quince.
at the duke’s oak we meet.

bottom.
enough. hold, or cut bow-strings.

 [_exeunt._]


act ii

scene i. a wood near athens

 enter a fairy at one door, and puck at another.

puck.
how now, spirit! whither wander you?

fairy
    over hill, over dale,
        thorough bush, thorough brier,
    over park, over pale,
        thorough flood, thorough [[fire]],
    i do wander everywhere,
    swifter than the moon’s sphere;
    and i serve the fairy queen,
    to dew her orbs upon the green.
    the cowslips tall her pensioners be,
    in their gold coats spots you see;
    those be rubies, fairy favours,
    in those freckles [[live]] their savours.
i must go seek some dew-drops here,
and hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.
farewell, thou lob of spirits; i’ll be gone.
our queen and all her elves come here anon.

puck.
the [[king]] doth keep his revels here tonight;
take heed the queen come not within his sight,
for oberon is passing fell and wrath,
because that she, as her attendant, hath
a lovely boy, stol’n from an [[indian]] [[king]];
she never had so sweet a changeling.
and [[jealous]] oberon would have the child
knight of his train, to trace the forests wild:
but she perforce withholds the lovèd boy,
crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.
and now they never meet in grove or green,
by fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
but they do square; that all their elves for fear
creep into acorn cups, and hide them there.

fairy
either i mistake your shape and making quite,
or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
call’d robin goodfellow. are not you he
that frights the maidens of the villagery,
skim milk, and sometimes [[labour]] in the quern,
and bootless make the breathless housewife churn,
and sometime make the drink to bear no barm,
mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
those that hobgoblin call you, and sweet puck,
you do their [[work]], and they shall have [[good]] [[luck]].
are not you he?

puck.
thou speak’st aright;
i am that merry wanderer of the night.
i jest to oberon, and make him smile,
when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
neighing in likeness of a filly foal;
and sometime lurk i in a gossip’s bowl
in very likeness of a roasted crab,
and, when she drinks, against her lips i bob,
and on her withered dewlap pour the ale.
the wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
then slip i from her bum, down topples she,
and ‘tailor’ cries, and falls into a cough;
and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe
and waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear
a merrier hour was never wasted there.
but room, fairy. here comes oberon.

fairy
and here my mistress. would that he were gone!

 enter oberon at one door, with his train, and titania at another, with
 hers.

oberon.
ill met by moonlight, proud titania.

titania.
what, [[jealous]] oberon! fairies, skip hence;
i have forsworn his bed and company.

oberon.
tarry, rash wanton; am not i thy [[lord]]?

titania.
then i must be thy [[lady]]; but i know
when thou hast stol’n away from fairyland,
and in the shape of corin sat all day
playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
to amorous phillida. why art [[arts]] thou here,
come from the farthest steep of [[india]],
but that, forsooth, the bouncing amazon,
your buskin’d mistress and your warrior [[love]],
to theseus must be wedded; and you come
to give their bed joy and [[prosperity]]?

oberon.
how canst thou thus, for shame, titania,
glance at my credit with hippolyta,
knowing i [[know]] thy [[love]] to theseus?
didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
from perigenia, whom he ravished?
and make him with [[fair]] aegles break his [[faith]],
with ariadne and antiopa?

titania.
these are the forgeries of [[jealousy]]:
and never, since the middle summer’s spring,
met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
by pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook,
or on the beachèd margent of the sea,
to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
but with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our [[sport]].
therefore the winds, piping to us in [[vain]],
as in [[revenge]], have suck’d up from the sea
contagious fogs; which, falling in the [[land]],
hath every pelting river made so proud
that they have overborne their continents.
the ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in [[vain]],
the ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
hath rotted ere his [[youth]] attain’d a beard.
the fold stands empty in the drownèd field,
and crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
the nine-men’s-morris is fill’d up with mud,
and the quaint mazes in the wanton green,
for lack of tread, are undistinguishable.
the [[human]] mortals want their winter here.
no night is now with hymn or carol blest.
therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
pale in her anger, washes all the air,
that rheumatic diseases do abound.
and thorough this distemperature we see
the seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;
and on old hiems’ thin and icy crown
an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
is, as in mockery, set. the spring, the summer,
the childing autumn, angry winter, change
their wonted liveries; and the mazed [[world]],
by their increase, now knows [[know]] not which is which.
and this same progeny of evils [[evil]] comes
from our debate, from our dissension;
we are their parents and original.

oberon.
do you amend it, then. it lies [[lie]] in you.
why should titania cross her oberon?
i do but beg a little changeling boy
to be my henchman.

titania.
set your [[heart]] at rest;
the fairyland buys not the child of me.
his [[mother]] was a vot’ress of my order,
and in the spicèd [[indian]] air, by night,
full often hath she gossip’d by my side;
and sat with me on neptune’s yellow sands,
marking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood,
when we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive,
and grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
following (her womb then [[rich]] with my [[young]] squire),
would imitate, and sail upon the [[land]],
to fetch me trifles, and return again,
as from a [[voyage]], [[rich]] with merchandise.
but she, being mortal, of that boy did [[die]];
and for her sake do i rear up her boy,
and for her sake i will not part with him.

oberon.
how long within this wood intend you stay?

titania.
perchance till after theseus’ wedding-day.
if you will patiently dance in our round,
and see our moonlight revels, go with us;
if not, shun me, and i will spare your haunts.

oberon.
give me that boy and i will go with thee.

titania.
not for thy fairy [[kingdom]]. fairies, away.
we shall chide downright if i longer stay.

 [_exit titania with her train._]

oberon.
well, go thy way. thou shalt not from this grove
till i torment thee for this injury.—
my gentle puck, come hither. thou rememb’rest
since once i sat upon a promontory,
and heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back
uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
that the rude sea grew civil at her song
and [[certain]] stars shot madly from their spheres
to hear the sea-maid’s [[music]].

puck.
i [[remember]].

oberon.
that very [[time]] i saw, (but thou couldst not),
flying between the cold moon and the [[earth]],
cupid all arm’d: a [[certain]] aim he took
at a [[fair]] vestal, thronèd by the west,
and loos’d his love-shaft smartly from his bow
as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts [[heart]].
but i might see [[young]] cupid’s fiery shaft
quench’d in the chaste beams of the watery moon;
and the imperial votress passed on,
in maiden meditation, fancy-free.
yet mark’d i where the bolt of cupid fell:
it fell upon a little western flower,
before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,
and maidens call it love-in-idleness.
fetch me that flower, the herb i showed thee once:
the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
will make or [[man]] or woman madly dote
upon the next [[live]] creature that it sees.
fetch me this herb, and be thou here again
ere the leviathan can swim a league.

puck.
i’ll put a girdle round about the earth
in forty minutes.

 [_exit puck._]

oberon.
having once this juice,
i’ll watch titania when she is asleep,
and drop the liquor of it in her [[eyes]]:
the next thing then she waking looks upon
(be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
on meddling monkey, or on busy ape)
she shall pursue it with the [[soul]] of [[love]].
and ere i take this charm from off her sight
(as i can take it with another herb)
i’ll make her render up her page to me.
but who comes here? i am invisible;
and i will overhear their conference.

 enter demetrius, helena following him.

demetrius.
i [[love]] thee not, therefore pursue me not.
where is lysander and [[fair]] hermia?
the one i’ll slay, the other slayeth me.
thou told’st me they were stol’n into this wood,
and here am i, and wode within this wood
because i cannot meet with hermia.
hence, get thee gone, and [[follow]] me no more.

helena.
you draw me, you hard-hearted adamant,
but yet you draw not iron, for my heart
is true as steel. leave you your [[power]] to draw,
and i shall have no [[power]] to [[follow]] you.

demetrius.
do i entice you? do i speak you [[fair]]?
or rather do i not in plainest truth
tell you i do not, nor i cannot [[love]] you?

helena.
and even for that do i [[love]] you the more.
i am your spaniel; and, demetrius,
the more you beat me, i will fawn on you.
use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
unworthy as i am, to [[follow]] you.
what worser place can i beg in your [[love]],
(and yet a place of high [[respect]] with me)
than to be usèd as you use your dog?

demetrius.
tempt not too much the [[hatred]] of my spirit;
for i am sick when i do look on thee.

helena.
and i am sick when i look not on you.

demetrius.
you do impeach your modesty too much
to leave the [[city]] and commit yourself
into the hands of one that loves [[love]] you not,
to trust the opportunity of night.
and the ill counsel of a desert place,
with the [[rich]] worth of your virginity.

helena.
your [[virtue]] is my [[privilege]]: for that.
it is not night when i do see your face,
therefore i [[think]] i am not in the night;
nor doth this wood lack worlds [[world]] of company,
for you, in my [[respect]], are all the [[world]].
then how can it be said i am alone
when all the [[world]] is here to look on me?

demetrius.
i’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
and leave thee to the [[mercy]] of wild beasts.

helena.
the wildest hath not such a [[heart]] as you.
run when you will, the story shall be chang’d;
apollo flies, and daphne holds the chase;
the dove pursues the griffin, the mild hind
makes speed to catch the tiger. bootless speed,
when cowardice pursues and valour flies!

demetrius.
i will not stay thy questions [[question]]. let me go,
or if thou [[follow]] me, do not believe
but i shall do thee mischief in the wood.

helena.
ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
you do me mischief. fie, demetrius!
your wrongs [[wrong]] do set a scandal on my [[sex]].
we cannot [[fight]] for [[love]] as [[men]] may do.
we should be woo’d, and were not made to woo.

 [_exit demetrius._]

i’ll [[follow]] thee, and make a [[heaven]] of hell,
to [[die]] upon the hand i [[love]] so well.

 [_exit helena._]

oberon.
fare thee well, [[nymph]]. ere he do leave this grove,
thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy [[love]].

 enter puck.

hast thou the flower there? welcome, wanderer.

puck.
ay, there it is.

oberon.
i [[pray]] thee give it me.
i [[know]] a bank where the wild thyme blows,
where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
with sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine.
there sleeps titania sometime of the night,
lull’d in these flowers with dances and delight;
and there the snake throws her enamell’d skin,
weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.
and with the juice of this i’ll streak her [[eyes]],
and make her full of hateful fantasies.
take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
a sweet athenian [[lady]] is in love
with a disdainful [[youth]]. anoint his [[eyes]];
but do it when the next thing he espies
may be the [[lady]]. thou shalt [[know]] the man
by the athenian garments he hath on.
effect it with some [[care]], that he may prove
more fond on her than she upon her [[love]]:
and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.

puck.
fear not, my [[lord]], your servant shall do so.

 [_exeunt._]


scene ii. another part of the wood

 enter titania with her train.

titania.
come, now a roundel and a fairy [[song]];
then for the third part of a minute, hence;
some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds;
some [[war]] with reremice for their leathern wings,
to make my small elves coats; and some keep back
the clamorous owl, that nightly hoots and wonders
at our quaint spirits. sing me now asleep;
then to your offices, and let me rest.

fairies sing.

first fairy.
    you spotted snakes with double tongue,
       thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
    newts and blind-worms do no [[wrong]],
       come not near our fairy queen:

chorus.
    philomel, with melody,
    sing in our sweet lullaby:
lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby.
    never harm, nor spell, nor charm,
    come our lovely [[lady]] nigh;
    so [[good]] night, with lullaby.

first fairy.
    weaving spiders, come not here;
       hence, you long-legg’d spinners, hence.
    beetles black, approach not near;
       worm nor snail do no offence.

chorus.
    philomel with melody, &c.

second fairy.
hence away! now all is well.
one aloof stand sentinel.

 [_exeunt fairies. titania sleeps._]

 enter oberon.

oberon.
what thou seest when thou dost wake,

 [_squeezes the flower on  titania’s eyelids._]

do it for thy true [[love]] take;
love and languish for his sake.
be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
pard, or boar with bristled hair,
in thy eye that shall appear
when thou wak’st, it is thy dear.
wake when some vile thing is near.

 [_exit._]

 enter lysander and hermia.

lysander.
fair [[love]], you faint with wand’ring in the wood.
and, to speak troth, i have forgot our way.
we’ll rest us, hermia, if you [[think]] it [[good]],
and tarry for the comfort of the day.

hermia.
be it so, lysander: find you out a bed,
for i upon this bank will rest my head.

lysander.
one turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
one [[heart]], one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.

hermia.
nay, [[good]] lysander; for my sake, my dear,
lie further off yet, do not [[lie]] so near.

lysander.
o take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
love takes the meaning in love’s conference.
i mean that my [[heart]] unto yours is knit,
so that but one [[heart]] we can make of it:
two bosoms interchainèd with an oath,
so then two bosoms and a [[single]] troth.
then by your side no bed-room me deny;
for lying so, hermia, i do not [[lie]].

hermia.
lysander riddles very prettily.
now much beshrew my manners and my [[pride]],
if hermia meant to say lysander lied!
but, gentle friend, for [[love]] and courtesy
lie further off, in [[human]] modesty,
such separation as may well be said
becomes a [[virtuous]] bachelor and a maid,
so far be distant; and [[good]] night, sweet friend:
thy [[love]] ne’er alter till thy sweet [[life]] end!

lysander.
amen, amen, to that [[fair]] prayer say i;
and then end [[life]] when i end loyalty!
here is my bed. sleep give thee all his rest!

hermia.
with half that [[wish]] the wisher’s [[eyes]] be pressed!

 [_they sleep._]

 enter puck.

puck.
through the forest have i gone,
but athenian found i none,
on whose [[eyes]] i might approve
this flower’s [[force]] in stirring [[love]].
night and silence! who is here?
weeds of [[athens]] he doth wear:
this is he, my master said,
despisèd the athenian maid;
and here the maiden, sleeping sound,
on the dank and dirty ground.
pretty [[soul]], she durst not lie
near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
churl, upon thy [[eyes]] i throw
all the [[power]] this charm doth owe;
when thou wak’st let [[love]] forbid
sleep his seat on thy eyelid.
so awake when i am gone;
for i must now to oberon.

 [_exit._]

 enter demetrius and helena, running.

helena.
stay, though thou kill me, sweet demetrius.

demetrius.
i charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.

helena.
o, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.

demetrius.
stay, on thy peril; i alone will go.

 [_exit demetrius._]

helena.
o, i am out of breath in this fond chase!
the more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
happy is hermia, wheresoe’er she lies [[lie]],
for she hath blessèd and attractive [[eyes]].
how came her [[eyes]] so bright? not with salt tears.
if so, my [[eyes]] are oftener wash’d than hers.
no, no, i am as ugly as a bear,
for beasts that meet me run away for [[fear]]:
therefore no marvel though demetrius
do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine
made me compare with hermia’s sphery eyne?
but who is here? lysander, on the ground!
dead or asleep? i see no [[blood]], no wound.
lysander, if you [[live]], [[good]] sir, awake.

lysander.
[_waking._] and run through [[fire]] i will for thy sweet sake.
transparent helena! [[nature]] shows art [[arts]],
that through thy bosom makes me see thy [[heart]].
where is demetrius? o, how fit a word
is that vile name to perish on my sword!

helena.
do not say so, lysander, say not so.
what though he [[love]] your hermia? [[lord]], what though?
yet hermia still loves [[love]] you. then be content.

lysander.
content with hermia? no, i do repent
the tedious minutes i with her have spent.
not hermia, but helena i [[love]].
who will not [[change]] a raven for a dove?
the will of [[man]] is by his [[reason]] sway’d,
and [[reason]] says you are the worthier maid.
things growing are not ripe until their season;
so i, being [[young]], till now ripe not to [[reason]];
and touching now the point of [[human]] [[skill]],
reason becomes the marshal to my will,
and leads me to your [[eyes]], where i o’erlook
love’s stories, written in love’s richest [[book]].

helena.
wherefore was i to this keen mockery born?
when at your hands did i deserve this scorn?
is’t not enough, is’t not enough, [[young]] [[man]],
that i did never, no, nor never can
deserve a sweet look from demetrius’ eye,
but you must flout my insufficiency?
good troth, you do me [[wrong]], [[good]] sooth, you do,
in such disdainful manner me to woo.
but fare you well; perforce i must confess,
i [[thought]] you [[lord]] of more true gentleness.
o, that a [[lady]] of one [[man]] refus’d,
should of another therefore be abus’d!

 [_exit._]

lysander.
she sees not hermia. hermia, sleep thou there,
and never mayst thou come lysander near!
for, as a surfeit of the sweetest things
the deepest loathing to the stomach brings;
or as the heresies that [[men]] do leave
are hated most of those they did [[deceive]];
so thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
of all be hated, but the most of me!
and, all my powers [[power]], address your [[love]] and might
to [[honour]] helen, and to be her knight!

 [_exit._]

hermia.
[_starting._] [[help]] me, lysander, [[help]] me! do thy best
to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
ay me, for pity! what a [[dream]] was here!
lysander, look how i do quake with [[fear]].
methought a serpent [[eat]] my [[heart]] away,
and you sat smiling at his cruel prey.
lysander! what, removed? lysander! lord!
what, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
alack, where are you? speak, and if you hear;
speak, of all loves! i swoon almost with [[fear]].
no? then i well perceive you are not nigh.
either [[death]] or you i’ll find immediately.

 [_exit._]


act iii

scene i. the wood.

 the queen of fairies still lying asleep.

 enter bottom, quince, snout, starveling, snug and flute.

bottom.
are we all met?

quince.
pat, pat; and here’s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal.
this green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our
tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will do it before the
duke.

bottom.
peter quince?

quince.
what sayest thou, bully bottom?

bottom.
there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisbe that will never
please. first, pyramus must draw a [[sword]] to kill himself; which the
ladies cannot abide. how [[answer]] you that?

snout
by’r lakin, a parlous [[fear]].

starveling.
i [[believe]] we must leave the killing out, when all is done.

bottom.
not a whit; i have a device to make all well. write me a prologue, and
let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords [[sword]], and
that pyramus is not killed indeed; and for the more [[better]] assurance,
tell them that i pyramus am not pyramus but bottom the weaver. this
will put them out of [[fear]].

quince.
well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written in eight
and six.

bottom.
no, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.

snout
will not the ladies [[lady]] be afeard of the lion?

starveling.
i [[fear]] it, i promise you.

bottom.
masters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (god shield
us!) a lion among ladies [[lady]] is a most dreadful thing. for there is not a
more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to
it.

snout
therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.

bottom.
nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the
lion’s neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the
same defect: ‘ladies,’ or, ‘fair ladies [[lady]], i would [[wish]] you,’ or, ‘i
would request you,’ or, ’i would entreat you, not to [[fear]], not to
tremble: my [[life]] for yours. if you [[think]] i come hither as a lion, it
were [[pity]] of my [[life]]. no, i am no such thing; i am a [[man]] as other men
are’: and there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly
he is snug the joiner.

quince.
well, it shall be so. but there is two hard things: that is, to bring
the moonlight into a chamber, for you [[know]], pyramus and thisbe meet by
moonlight.

snout
doth the moon shine that night we play our play?

bottom.
a calendar, a calendar! look in the almanack; find out moonshine, find
out moonshine.

quince.
yes, it doth shine that night.

bottom.
why, then may you leave a casement of the [[great]] chamber window, where
we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.

quince.
ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and
say he comes to disfigure or to [[present]] the [[person]] of moonshine. then
there is another thing: we must have a wall in the [[great]] chamber; for
pyramus and thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a
wall.

snout
you can never bring in a wall. what say you, bottom?

bottom.
some [[man]] or other must [[present]] wall. and let him have some plaster, or
some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him
hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisbe
whisper.

quince.
if that may be, then all is well. come, sit down, every mother’s [[son]],
and rehearse your parts. pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
speech, enter into that brake; and so everyone according to his cue.

 enter puck behind.

puck.
what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,
so near the cradle of the fairy queen?
what, a play toward? i’ll be an auditor;
an actor too perhaps, if i see cause.

quince.
speak, pyramus.—thisbe, stand forth.

pyramus.
_thisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet_

quince.
odours, odours.

pyramus.
_. . . odours savours sweet.
so hath thy breath, my dearest thisbe dear.
but hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
and by and by i will to thee appear._

 [_exit._]

puck.
a stranger pyramus than e’er played here!

 [_exit._]

thisbe.
must i speak now?

quince.
ay, [[marry]], must you, for you must [[understand]] he goes but to see a noise
that he heard, and is to come again.

thisbe.
_most radiant pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely jew,
as true as truest horse, that yet would never tire,
i’ll meet thee, pyramus, at ninny’s tomb._

quince.
ninus’ tomb, man! why, you must not speak that yet. that you [[answer]] to
pyramus. you speak all your part at once, cues, and all.—pyramus enter!
your cue is [[past]]; it is ‘never tire.’

thisbe.
o, _as true as truest horse, that yet would never tire._

 enter puck and bottom with an ass’s head.

pyramus.
_if i were [[fair]], thisbe, i were only thine._

quince.
o monstrous! o strange! we are haunted. [[pray]], masters, fly, masters!
help!

 [_exeunt clowns._]

puck.
i’ll [[follow]] you. i’ll lead you about a round,
   through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier;
sometime a horse i’ll be, sometime a hound,
   a hog, a headless bear, sometime a [[fire]];
and neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
like horse, hound, hog, bear, [[fire]], at every turn.

 [_exit._]

bottom.
why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to make me afeard.

 enter snout.

snout
o bottom, thou art [[arts]] changed! what do i see on thee?

bottom.
what do you see? you see an ass-head of your own, do you?

 [_exit snout._]

 enter quince.

quince.
bless thee, bottom! bless thee! thou art [[arts]] translated.

 [_exit._]

bottom.
i see their knavery. this is to make an ass of me, to fright me, if
they could. but i will not stir from this place, do what they can. i
will walk up and down here, and i will sing, that they shall hear i am
not afraid.
[_sings._]
       the ousel cock, so black of hue,
          with orange-tawny bill,
       the throstle with his note so true,
          the wren with little quill.

titania.
[_waking._] what angel wakes me from my flowery bed?

bottom.
[_sings._]
       the finch, the sparrow, and the lark,
          the plain-song cuckoo gray,
       whose note full many a [[man]] doth mark,
          and dares not [[answer]] nay.
for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird? who would give
a bird the [[lie]], though he cry ‘cuckoo’ never so?

titania.
i [[pray]] thee, gentle mortal, sing again.
mine ear is much enamour’d of thy note.
so is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape;
and thy [[fair]] virtue’s [[force]] perforce doth move me,
on the first view, to say, to swear, i [[love]] thee.

bottom.
methinks, mistress, you should have little [[reason]] for that. and yet, to
say the [[truth]], [[reason]] and [[love]] keep little company together nowadays.
the more the [[pity]] that some honest neighbours will not make them
friends. nay, i can gleek upon [[occasion]].

titania.
thou art [[arts]] as [[wise]] as thou art [[arts]] beautiful.

bottom.
not so, neither; but if i had wit enough to get out of this wood, i
have enough to serve mine own turn.

titania.
out of this wood do not [[desire]] to go.
thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.
i am a spirit of no [[common]] rate.
the summer still doth tend upon my [[state]];
and i do [[love]] thee: therefore, go with me.
i’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee;
and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
and sing, while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep.
and i will purge thy mortal grossness so
that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.—
peaseblossom! cobweb! moth! and mustardseed!

 enter four fairies.

peaseblossom.
ready.


cobweb.
and i.


moth.
and i.


mustardseed.
and i.


all.
where shall we go?

titania.
be [[kind]] and courteous to this gentleman;
hop in his walks and gambol in his [[eyes]];
feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
with purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
the honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
and for night-tapers, crop their waxen thighs,
and [[light]] them at the fiery glow-worm’s [[eyes]],
to have my [[love]] to bed and to arise;
and pluck the wings from painted butterflies,
to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping [[eyes]].
nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.


peaseblossom.
hail, mortal!


cobweb.
hail!


moth.
hail!


mustardseed.
hail!

bottom.
i cry your worships [[mercy]], heartily.—i beseech your worship’s name.

cobweb.
cobweb.

bottom.
i shall [[desire]] you of more acquaintance, [[good]] master cobweb. if i cut
my finger, i shall make bold with you.—your name, honest gentleman?

peaseblossom.
peaseblossom.

bottom.
i [[pray]] you, commend me to mistress squash, your [[mother]], and to master
peascod, your [[father]]. [[good]] master peaseblossom, i shall [[desire]] you of
more acquaintance too.—your name, i beseech you, sir?

mustardseed.
mustardseed.

bottom.
good master mustardseed, i [[know]] your patience well. that same cowardly
giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house. i
promise you, your kindred hath made my [[eyes]] water ere now. i [[desire]] you
of more acquaintance, [[good]] master mustardseed.

titania.
come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
   the moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye,
and when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
   lamenting some enforced chastity.
tie up my love’s tongue, bring him silently.

 [_exeunt._]


scene ii. another part of the wood

 enter oberon.

oberon.
i wonder if titania be awak’d;
then, what it was that next came in her eye,
which she must dote on in extremity.

 enter puck.

here comes my messenger. how now, mad spirit?
what night-rule now about this haunted grove?

puck.
my mistress with a monster is in [[love]].
near to her close and consecrated bower,
while she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
a crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
that [[work]] for bread upon athenian stalls,
were met together to rehearse a play
intended for [[great]] theseus’ nuptial day.
the shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort
who pyramus presented in their [[sport]],
forsook his scene and enter’d in a brake.
when i did him at this advantage take,
an ass’s nole i fixed on his head.
anon, his thisbe must be answerèd,
and forth my mimic comes. when they him spy,
as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
rising and cawing at the gun’s report,
sever themselves and madly sweep the [[sky]],
so at his sight away his fellows fly,
and at our stamp, here o’er and o’er one falls;
he murder cries, and [[help]] from [[athens]] calls.
their sense thus [[weak]], lost with their fears [[fear]], thus [[strong]],
made senseless things begin to do them [[wrong]];
for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.
i [[led]] them on in this distracted [[fear]],
and left sweet pyramus translated there.
when in that moment, so it came to pass,
titania wak’d, and straightway lov’d an ass.

oberon.
this falls out [[better]] than i could devise.
but hast thou yet latch’d the athenian’s eyes
with the love-juice, as i did bid thee do?

puck.
i took him sleeping—that is finish’d too—
and the athenian woman by his side,
that, when he wak’d, of [[force]] she must be ey’d.

 enter demetrius and hermia.

oberon.
stand close. this is the same athenian.

puck.
this is the woman, but not this the [[man]].

demetrius.
o why rebuke you him that loves [[love]] you so?
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.

hermia.
now i but chide, but i should use thee worse,
for thou, i [[fear]], hast given me cause to curse.
if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep,
being o’er shoes in [[blood]], plunge in the deep,
and kill me too.
the sun was not so true unto the day
as he to me. would he have stol’n away
from sleeping hermia? i’ll [[believe]] as soon
this whole [[earth]] may be bor’d, and that the moon
may through the centre creep and so displease
her brother’s noontide with th’ antipodes.
it cannot be but thou hast murder’d him.
so should a murderer look, so [[dead]], so grim.

demetrius.
so should the murder’d look, and so should i,
pierc’d through the [[heart]] with your stern [[cruelty]].
yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
as yonder [[venus]] in her glimmering sphere.

hermia.
what’s this to my lysander? where is he?
ah, [[good]] demetrius, wilt thou give him me?

demetrius.
i had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

hermia.
out, dog! out, cur! thou driv’st me [[past]] the bounds
of maiden’s patience. hast thou slain him, then?
henceforth be never number’d among men!
o once tell true; tell true, even for my sake!
durst thou have look’d upon him, being awake,
and hast thou kill’d him sleeping? o brave touch!
could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
an adder did it; for with doubler tongue
than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.

demetrius.
you spend your passion on a mispris’d mood:
i am not guilty of lysander’s [[blood]];
nor is he [[dead]], for aught that i can tell.

hermia.
i [[pray]] thee, tell me then that he is well.

demetrius.
and if i could, what should i get therefore?

hermia.
a [[privilege]] never to see me more.
and from thy hated presence part i so:
see me no more, whether he be [[dead]] or no.

 [_exit._]

demetrius.
there is no following her in this fierce vein.
here, therefore, for a while i will remain.
so sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow
for debt that bankrupt sleep doth [[sorrow]] owe;
which now in some slight measure it will [[pay]],
if for his tender here i make some stay.

 [_lies down._]

oberon.
what hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite,
and laid the love-juice on some true-love’s sight.
of thy misprision must perforce ensue
some true [[love]] turn’d, and not a false turn’d true.

puck.
then [[fate]] o’er-rules, that, one [[man]] holding troth,
a million fail, confounding oath on oath.

oberon.
about the wood go swifter than the wind,
and helena of [[athens]] look thou find.
all fancy-sick she is, and pale of cheer
with sighs of [[love]], that costs the fresh [[blood]] dear.
by some illusion see thou bring her here;
i’ll charm his [[eyes]] against she do appear.

puck.
i go, i go; look how i go,
swifter than arrow from the tartar’s bow.

 [_exit._]

oberon.
    flower of this purple dye,
    hit with cupid’s archery,
    sink in apple of his eye.
    when his [[love]] he doth espy,
    let her shine as gloriously
    as the [[venus]] of the [[sky]].—
    when thou wak’st, if she be by,
    beg of her for remedy.

 enter puck.

puck.
    captain of our fairy band,
    helena is here at hand,
    and the [[youth]] mistook by me,
    pleading for a lover’s fee.
    shall we their fond pageant see?
    [[lord]], what fools [[fool]] these mortals be!

oberon.
    stand aside. the noise they make
    will cause demetrius to awake.

puck.
    then will two at once woo one.
    that must needs be [[sport]] alone;
    and those things do [[best]] please me
    that befall prepost’rously.

 enter lysander and helena.

lysander.
why should you [[think]] that i should woo in scorn?
scorn and derision never come in tears.
look when i vow, i weep; and vows so born,
in their nativity all [[truth]] appears.
how can these things in me seem scorn to you,
bearing the badge of [[faith]], to prove them true?

helena.
you do advance your cunning more and more.
when [[truth]] kills [[truth]], o devilish-holy fray!
these vows are hermia’s: will you give her o’er?
weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
will even weigh; and both as [[light]] as tales.

lysander.
i had no [[judgment]] when to her i swore.

helena.
nor none, in my [[mind]], now you give her o’er.

lysander.
demetrius loves [[love]] her, and he loves [[love]] not you.

demetrius.
[_waking._] o helen, [[goddess]], [[nymph]], [[perfect]], divine!
to what, my [[love]], shall i compare thine eyne?
crystal is muddy. o how ripe in show
thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
that pure congealèd [[white]], high taurus’ snow,
fann’d with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
when thou hold’st up thy hand. o, let me kiss
this princess of pure [[white]], this seal of bliss!

helena.
o spite! o hell! i see you all are bent
to set against me for your merriment.
if you were civil, and knew courtesy,
you would not do me thus much injury.
can you not hate me, as i [[know]] you do,
but you must join in souls [[soul]] to mock me too?
if you were [[men]], as [[men]] you are in show,
you would not use a gentle [[lady]] so;
to vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
when i am sure you hate me with your hearts [[heart]].
you both are rivals, and [[love]] hermia;
and now both rivals, to mock helena.
a trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
to conjure tears up in a [[poor]] maid’s eyes
with your derision! none of [[noble]] sort
would so offend a virgin, and extort
a [[poor]] soul’s patience, all to make you [[sport]].

lysander.
you are unkind, demetrius; be not so,
for you [[love]] hermia; this you [[know]] i [[know]].
and here, with all [[good]] will, with all my [[heart]],
in hermia’s [[love]] i yield you up my part;
and yours of helena to me bequeath,
whom i do [[love]] and will do till my [[death]].

helena.
never did mockers waste more idle breath.

demetrius.
lysander, keep thy hermia; i will none.
if e’er i lov’d her, all that [[love]] is gone.
my [[heart]] to her but as guest-wise sojourn’d;
and now to helen is it [[home]] return’d,
there to remain.

lysander.
helen, it is not so.

demetrius.
disparage not the [[faith]] thou dost not [[know]],
lest to thy peril thou aby it dear.
look where thy [[love]] comes; yonder is thy dear.

 enter hermia.

hermia.
dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
the ear more quick of apprehension makes;
wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
it pays [[pay]] the hearing double recompense.
thou art [[arts]] not by mine eye, lysander, found;
mine ear, i thank it, brought me to thy sound.
but why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

lysander.
why should he stay whom [[love]] doth press to go?

hermia.
what [[love]] could press lysander from my side?

lysander.
lysander’s [[love]], that would not let him bide,
fair helena, who more engilds the night
than all yon fiery oes and [[eyes]] of [[light]].
why seek’st thou me? could not this make thee know
the hate i bare thee made me leave thee so?

hermia.
you speak not as you [[think]]; it cannot be.

helena.
lo, she is one of this confederacy!
now i perceive they have conjoin’d all three
to [[fashion]] this false [[sport]] in spite of me.
injurious hermia, most ungrateful maid!
have you conspir’d, have you with these contriv’d,
to bait me with this foul derision?
is all the counsel that we two have shar’d,
the sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent,
when we have chid the hasty-footed time
for parting us—o, is all forgot?
all school-days’ [[friendship]], [[childhood]] innocence?
we, hermia, like two artificial gods,
have with our needles created both one flower,
both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
both warbling of one [[song]], both in one key,
as if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds [[mind]],
had been incorporate. so we grew together,
like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
but yet a union in partition,
two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
so, with two seeming bodies [[body]], but one [[heart]];
two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
due but to one, and crownèd with one crest.
and will you rent our ancient [[love]] asunder,
to join with [[men]] in scorning your [[poor]] friend?
it is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly.
our [[sex]], as well as i, may chide you for it,
though i alone do [[feel]] the injury.

hermia.
i am amazèd at your passionate words:
i scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.

helena.
have you not set lysander, as in scorn,
to [[follow]] me, and [[praise]] my [[eyes]] and face?
and made your other [[love]], demetrius,
who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
to call me [[goddess]], [[nymph]], [[divine]] and rare,
precious, celestial? wherefore speaks he this
to her he hates? and wherefore doth lysander
deny your [[love]], so [[rich]] within his [[soul]],
and tender me, forsooth, affection,
but by your setting on, by your [[consent]]?
what though i be not so in grace as you,
so hung upon with [[love]], so fortunate,
but miserable most, to [[love]] unlov’d?
this you should [[pity]] rather than despise.

hermia.
i [[understand]] not what you mean by this.

helena.
ay, do. persever, counterfeit [[sad]] looks,
make mouths upon me when i turn my back,
wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up.
this [[sport]], well carried, shall be chronicled.
if you have any [[pity]], grace, or manners,
you would not make me such an argument.
but fare ye well. ’tis partly my own [[fault]],
which [[death]], or absence, soon shall remedy.

lysander.
stay, gentle helena; hear my excuse;
my [[love]], my [[life]], my [[soul]], [[fair]] helena!

helena.
o excellent!

hermia.
sweet, do not scorn her so.

demetrius.
if she cannot entreat, i can compel.

lysander.
thou canst compel no more than she entreat;
thy threats have no more [[strength]] than her [[weak]] prayers.
helen, i [[love]] thee, by my [[life]] i do;
i swear by that which i will lose for thee
to prove him false that says i [[love]] thee not.

demetrius.
i say i [[love]] thee more than he can do.

lysander.
if thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.

demetrius.
quick, come.

hermia.
lysander, whereto tends all this?

lysander.
away, you ethiope!

demetrius.
no, no. he will
seem to break loose. take on as you would [[follow]],
but yet come not. you are a tame [[man]], go!

lysander.
hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
or i will shake thee from me like a serpent.

hermia.
why are you grown so rude? what [[change]] is this,
sweet [[love]]?

lysander.
thy [[love]]? out, tawny tartar, out!
out, loathèd medicine! o hated potion, hence!

hermia.
do you not jest?

helena.
yes, sooth, and so do you.

lysander.
demetrius, i will keep my word with thee.

demetrius.
i would i had your bond; for i perceive
a [[weak]] bond holds you; i’ll not trust your word.

lysander.
what, should i hurt her, strike her, kill her [[dead]]?
although i hate her, i’ll not harm her so.

hermia.
what, can you do me greater harm than hate?
hate me? wherefore? o me! what news, my [[love]]?
am not i hermia? are not you lysander?
i am as [[fair]] now as i was erewhile.
since night you lov’d me; yet since night you left me.
why then, you left me—o, the gods forbid!—
in earnest, shall i say?

lysander.
ay, by my [[life]];
and never did [[desire]] to see thee more.
therefore be out of [[hope]], of [[question]], of [[doubt]];
be [[certain]], nothing truer; ’tis no jest
that i do hate thee and [[love]] helena.

hermia.
o me! you juggler! you cankerblossom!
you thief of love! what! have you come by night
and stol’n my love’s [[heart]] from him?

helena.
fine, i’ faith!
have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
no touch of bashfulness? what, will you tear
impatient answers [[answer]] from my gentle tongue?
fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!

hermia.
puppet! why so? ay, that way goes the game.
now i perceive that she hath made compare
between our statures; she hath urg’d her height;
and with her personage, her tall personage,
her height, forsooth, she hath prevail’d with him.
and are you grown so high in his esteem
because i am so dwarfish and so low?
how low am i, thou painted maypole? speak,
how low am i? i am not yet so low
but that my nails can reach unto thine [[eyes]].

helena.
i [[pray]] you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
let her not hurt me. i was never curst;
i have no gift at all in shrewishness;
i am a [[right]] maid for my cowardice;
let her not strike me. you perhaps may [[think]],
because she is something lower than myself,
that i can match her.

hermia.
lower! hark, again.

helena.
good hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
i evermore did [[love]] you, hermia,
did ever keep your counsels, never wrong’d you,
save that, in [[love]] unto demetrius,
i told him of your stealth unto this wood.
he follow’d you; for [[love]] i follow’d him;
but he hath chid me hence, and threaten’d me
to strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
and now, so you will let me quiet go,
to [[athens]] will i bear my folly back,
and [[follow]] you no further. let me go:
you see how simple and how fond i am.

hermia.
why, get you gone. who is’t that hinders you?

helena.
a foolish [[heart]] that i leave here behind.

hermia.
what! with lysander?

helena.
with demetrius.

lysander.
be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, helena.

demetrius.
no, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

helena.
o, when she’s angry, she is keen and shrewd.
she was a vixen when she went to school,
and though she be but little, she is fierce.

hermia.
little again! nothing but low and little?
why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
let me come to her.

lysander.
get you gone, you dwarf;
you minimus, of hind’ring knot-grass made;
you bead, you acorn.

demetrius.
you are too officious
in her behalf that scorns your services.
let her alone. speak not of helena;
take not her part; for if thou dost intend
never so little show of [[love]] to her,
thou shalt aby it.

lysander.
now she holds me not.
now [[follow]], if thou dar’st, to try whose [[right]],
of thine or mine, is most in helena.

demetrius.
follow! nay, i’ll go with thee, cheek by jole.

 [_exeunt lysander and demetrius._]

hermia.
you, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
nay, go not back.

helena.
i will not trust you, i,
nor longer stay in your curst company.
your hands than mine are quicker for a fray.
my legs are longer though, to run away.

 [_exit._]

hermia.
i am amaz’d, and [[know]] not what to say.

 [_exit, pursuing helena._]

oberon.
this is thy negligence: still thou mistak’st,
or else commit’st thy knaveries willfully.

puck.
believe me, [[king]] of shadows, i mistook.
did not you tell me i should [[know]] the man
by the athenian garments he had on?
and so far blameless proves my enterprise
that i have ’nointed an athenian’s [[eyes]]:
and so far am i glad it so did sort,
as this their jangling i esteem a [[sport]].

oberon.
thou seest these lovers seek a place to [[fight]].
hie therefore, robin, overcast the night;
the starry welkin cover thou anon
with drooping fog, as black as acheron,
and lead these testy rivals so astray
as one come not within another’s way.
like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
then stir demetrius up with bitter [[wrong]];
and sometime rail thou like demetrius.
and from each other look thou lead them thus,
till o’er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.
then crush this herb into lysander’s eye,
whose liquor hath this [[virtuous]] [[property]],
to take from thence all error with his might
and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
when they next wake, all this derision
shall seem a [[dream]] and fruitless vision;
and back to [[athens]] shall the lovers wend,
with league whose date till [[death]] shall never end.
whiles i in this affair do thee employ,
i’ll to my queen, and beg her [[indian]] boy;
and then i will her charmèd eye release
from monster’s view, and all things shall be [[peace]].

puck.
my fairy [[lord]], this must be done with haste,
for night’s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast;
and yonder shines aurora’s harbinger,
at whose approach, ghosts wandering here and there
troop [[home]] to churchyards. damnèd spirits all,
that in cross-ways and floods have burial,
already to their wormy beds are gone;
for [[fear]] lest day should look their shames upon,
they wilfully themselves [[exile]] from [[light]],
and must for aye consort with black-brow’d night.

oberon.
but we are spirits of another sort:
i with the morning’s [[love]] have oft made [[sport]];
and, like a forester, the groves may tread
even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
opening on [[neptune]] with [[fair]] blessèd beams,
turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.
but, notwithstanding, haste, make no delay.
we may effect this [[business]] yet ere day.

 [_exit oberon._]

puck.
    up and down, up and down,
    i will lead them up and down.
    i am fear’d in field and town.
    goblin, lead them up and down.
here comes one.

 enter lysander.

lysander.
where art [[arts]] thou, proud demetrius? speak thou now.

puck.
here, villain, drawn and ready. where art [[arts]] thou?

lysander.
i will be with thee straight.

puck.
follow me then to plainer ground.

 [_exit lysander as following the voice._]

 enter demetrius.

demetrius.
lysander, speak again.
thou runaway, thou [[coward]], art [[arts]] thou fled?
speak. in some bush? where dost thou hide thy head?

puck.
thou [[coward]], art [[arts]] thou bragging to the stars,
telling the bushes that thou look’st for wars [[war]],
and wilt not come? come, recreant, come, thou child!
i’ll whip thee with a rod. he is defil’d
that draws a [[sword]] on thee.

demetrius.
yea, art [[arts]] thou there?

puck.
follow my voice; we’ll try no manhood here.

 [_exeunt._]

 enter lysander.

lysander.
he goes before me, and still dares me on;
when i come where he calls, then he is gone.
the villain is much lighter-heel’d than i:
i follow’d fast, but faster he did fly,
that fallen am i in dark uneven way,
and here will rest me.  come, thou gentle day!
[_lies down._] for if but once thou show me thy grey [[light]],
i’ll find demetrius, and [[revenge]] this spite.

 [_sleeps._]

 enter puck and demetrius.

puck.
ho, ho, ho! [[coward]], why com’st thou not?

demetrius.
abide me, if thou dar’st; for well i wot
thou runn’st before me, shifting every place,
and dar’st not stand, nor look me in the face.
where art [[arts]] thou?

puck.
come hither; i am here.

demetrius.
nay, then, thou mock’st me. thou shalt buy this dear
if ever i thy face by daylight see:
now go thy way. faintness constraineth me
to measure out my length on this cold bed.
by day’s approach look to be visited.

 [_lies down and sleeps._]

 enter helena.

helena.
o weary night, o long and tedious night,
    abate thy hours! shine, comforts, from the east,
that i may back to [[athens]] by daylight,
    from these that my [[poor]] company detest.
and sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye,
steal me awhile from mine own company.

 [_sleeps._]

puck.
    yet but three? come one more.
    two of both kinds [[kind]] makes up four.
    here she comes, curst and [[sad]].
    cupid is a knavish lad
    thus to make [[poor]] females mad.

 enter hermia.

hermia.
never so weary, never so in woe,
   bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers,
i can no further crawl, no further go;
   my legs can keep no pace with my desires [[desire]].
here will i rest me till the break of day.
heavens shield lysander, if they mean a fray!

 [_lies down._]

puck.
         on the ground
         sleep sound.
         i’ll apply
         to your eye,
       gentle lover, remedy.

 [_squeezing the juice on lysander’s eye._]

         when thou wak’st,
         thou tak’st
         true delight
         in the sight
       of thy former lady’s eye.
       and the [[country]] proverb known,
       that every [[man]] should take his own,
       in your waking shall be shown:
         jack shall have jill;
         nought shall go ill;
the [[man]] shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

 [_exit puck._]


act iv

scene i. the wood

 lysander, demetrius, helena and hermia still asleep.

 enter titania and bottom; peaseblossom, cobweb, moth, mustardseed and
 other fairies attending; oberon behind, unseen.

titania.
come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
   while i thy amiable cheeks do coy,
and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
   and kiss thy [[fair]] large ears, my gentle joy.

bottom.
where’s peaseblossom?

peaseblossom.
ready.

bottom.
scratch my head, peaseblossom. where’s monsieur cobweb?

cobweb.
ready.

bottom.
monsieur cobweb; [[good]] monsieur, get you your [[weapons]] in your hand and
kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
monsieur, bring me the honey-bag. do not fret yourself too much in the
action, monsieur; and, [[good]] monsieur, have a [[care]] the honey-bag break
not; i would be loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag, signior.
where’s monsieur mustardseed?

mustardseed.
ready.

bottom.
give me your neaf, monsieur mustardseed. [[pray]] you, leave your courtesy,
good monsieur.

mustardseed.
what’s your will?

bottom.
nothing, [[good]] monsieur, but to [[help]] cavalery cobweb to scratch. i must
to the barber’s, monsieur, for methinks i am marvellous hairy about the
face; and i am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, i must
scratch.

titania.
what, wilt thou hear some [[music]], my sweet [[love]]?

bottom.
i have a reasonable [[good]] ear in [[music]]. let us have the tongs and the
bones.


titania.
or say, sweet [[love]], what thou desirest to [[eat]].

bottom.
truly, a peck of provender; i could munch your [[good]] dry oats. methinks
i have a [[great]] [[desire]] to a bottle of hay: [[good]] hay, sweet hay, hath no
fellow.

titania.
i have a venturous fairy that shall seek
the squirrel’s hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.

bottom.
i had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. but, i [[pray]] you, let
none of your [[people]] stir me; i have an exposition of sleep come upon
me.

titania.
sleep thou, and i will wind thee in my arms.
fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.
so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
gently entwist, the female ivy so
enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
o, how i [[love]] thee! how i dote on thee!

 [_they sleep._]

 oberon advances. enter puck.

oberon.
welcome, [[good]] robin. seest thou this sweet sight?
her dotage now i do begin to [[pity]].
for, meeting her of late behind the wood,
seeking sweet favours for this hateful [[fool]],
i did upbraid her and fall out with her:
for she his hairy temples then had rounded
with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
and that same dew, which sometime on the buds
was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
stood now within the pretty flouriets’ [[eyes]],
like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
when i had at my [[pleasure]] taunted her,
and she in mild terms begg’d my patience,
i then did ask of her her changeling child;
which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
to bear him to my bower in fairyland.
and now i have the boy, i will undo
this hateful imperfection of her [[eyes]].
and, gentle puck, take this transformèd scalp
from off the head of this athenian swain,
that he awaking when the other do,
may all to [[athens]] back again repair,
and [[think]] no more of this night’s accidents
but as the fierce vexation of a [[dream]].
but first i will release the fairy queen.

 [_touching her [[eyes]] with an herb._]

    be as thou wast wont to be;
    see as thou was wont to see.
    dian’s bud o’er cupid’s flower
    hath such [[force]] and blessed [[power]].
now, my titania, wake you, my sweet queen.

titania.
my oberon, what visions have i seen!
methought i was enamour’d of an ass.

oberon.
there lies [[lie]] your [[love]].

titania.
how came these things to pass?
o, how mine [[eyes]] do loathe his visage now!

oberon.
silence awhile.—robin, take off this head.
titania, [[music]] call; and strike more dead
than [[common]] sleep, of all these five the sense.

titania.
music, ho, [[music]], such as charmeth sleep.

puck.
now when thou wak’st, with thine own fool’s [[eyes]] peep.

oberon.
sound, [[music]].

 [_still mucic._]

come, my queen, take hands with me,
and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
now thou and i are new in amity,
and will tomorrow midnight solemnly
dance in duke theseus’ house triumphantly,
and bless it to all [[fair]] [[prosperity]]:
there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
wedded, with theseus, all in jollity.

puck.
    fairy [[king]], attend and mark.
    i do hear the morning lark.

oberon.
    then, my queen, in [[silence]] [[sad]],
    trip we after night’s shade.
    we the globe can compass soon,
    swifter than the wand’ring moon.

titania.
    come, my [[lord]], and in our flight,
    tell me how it came this night
    that i sleeping here was found
    with these mortals on the ground.

 [_exeunt. horns sound within._]

 enter theseus, hippolyta, egeus and train.

theseus.
go, one of you, find out the forester;
for now our observation is perform’d;
and since we have the vaward of the day,
my [[love]] shall hear the [[music]] of my hounds.
uncouple in the western valley; let them go.
dispatch i say, and find the forester.

 [_exit an attendant._]

we will, [[fair]] queen, up to the mountain’s top,
and mark the musical confusion
of hounds and echo in conjunction.

hippolyta.
i was with hercules and cadmus once,
when in a wood of crete they bay’d the bear
with hounds of sparta. never did i hear
such gallant chiding; for, besides the groves,
the skies [[sky]], the fountains, every region near
seem’d all one mutual cry. i never heard
so musical a discord, such sweet thunder.

theseus.
my hounds are bred out of the spartan [[kind]],
so flew’d, so sanded; and their heads are hung
with ears that sweep away the morning dew;
crook-knee’d and dewlap’d like thessalian bulls;
slow in pursuit, but match’d in mouth like bells,
each under each. a cry more tuneable
was never holla’d to, nor cheer’d with horn,
in crete, in sparta, nor in thessaly.
judge when you hear.—but, soft, what nymphs [[nymph]] are these?

egeus.
my [[lord]], this is my [[daughter]] here asleep,
and this lysander; this demetrius is;
this helena, old nedar’s helena:
i wonder of their being here together.

theseus.
no [[doubt]] they rose up early to observe
the rite of may; and, hearing our intent,
came here in grace of our solemnity.
but speak, egeus; is not this the day
that hermia should give [[answer]] of her [[choice]]?

egeus.
it is, my [[lord]].

theseus.
go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.

 horns, and shout within. demetrius, lysander, hermia and helena wake
 and start up.

good morrow, [[friends]]. saint valentine is [[past]].
begin these wood-birds but to couple now?

lysander.
pardon, my [[lord]].

 he and the rest kneel to  theseus.

theseus.
i [[pray]] you all, stand up.
i [[know]] you two are rival enemies [[enemy]].
how comes this gentle concord in the [[world]],
that [[hatred]] is so far from jealousy
to sleep by hate, and [[fear]] no enmity?

lysander.
my [[lord]], i shall reply amazedly,
half sleep, half waking; but as yet, i swear,
i cannot truly say how i came here.
but, as i [[think]] (for truly would i speak)
and now i do bethink me, so it is:
i came with hermia hither. our intent
was to be gone from [[athens]], where we might be,
without the peril of the athenian [[law]].

egeus.
enough, enough, my [[lord]]; you have enough.
i beg the [[law]], the [[law]] upon his head.
they would have stol’n away, they would, demetrius,
thereby to have defeated you and me:
you of your [[wife]], and me of my [[consent]],
of my [[consent]] that she should be your [[wife]].

demetrius.
my [[lord]], [[fair]] helen told me of their stealth,
of this their [[purpose]] hither to this wood;
and i in fury hither follow’d them,
fair helena in fancy following me.
but, my [[good]] [[lord]], i wot not by what [[power]],
(but by some [[power]] it is) my [[love]] to hermia,
melted as the snow, seems to me now
as the remembrance of an idle gaud
which in my [[childhood]] i did dote upon;
and all the [[faith]], the [[virtue]] of my [[heart]],
the object and the [[pleasure]] of mine eye,
is only helena. to her, my [[lord]],
was i betroth’d ere i saw hermia.
but like a sickness did i loathe this food.
but, as in health, come to my [[natural]] taste,
now i do [[wish]] it, [[love]] it, long for it,
and will for evermore be true to it.

theseus.
fair lovers, you are fortunately met.
of this discourse we more will hear anon.
egeus, i will overbear your will;
for in the temple, by and by with us,
these couples shall eternally be knit.
and, for the morning now is something worn,
our purpos’d hunting shall be set aside.
away with us to [[athens]]. three and three,
we’ll hold a feast in [[great]] solemnity.
come, hippolyta.

 [_exeunt theseus, hippolyta, egeus and train._]

demetrius.
these things seem small and undistinguishable,
like far-off mountains turnèd into clouds.

hermia.
methinks i see these things with parted eye,
when everything seems double.

helena.
so methinks.
and i have found demetrius like a jewel,
mine own, and not mine own.

demetrius.
are you sure
that we are awake? it seems to me
that yet we sleep, we [[dream]]. do not you think
the duke was here, and bid us [[follow]] him?

hermia.
yea, and my [[father]].

helena.
and hippolyta.

lysander.
and he did bid us [[follow]] to the temple.

demetrius.
why, then, we are awake: let’s [[follow]] him,
and by the way let us recount our dreams [[dream]].

 [_exeunt._]

bottom.
[_waking._] when my cue comes, call me, and i will [[answer]]. my next is
‘most [[fair]] pyramus.’ heigh-ho! peter quince! flute, the bellows-mender!
snout, the tinker! starveling! [[god’s]] my life! stol’n hence, and left me
asleep! i have had a most rare vision. i have had a [[dream]], [[past]] the wit
of [[man]] to say what [[dream]] it was. [[man]] is but an ass if he go about to
expound this [[dream]]. methought i was—there is no [[man]] can tell what.
methought i was, and methought i had—but [[man]] is but a patched [[fool]] if
he will offer to say what methought i had. the eye of [[man]] hath not
heard, the ear of [[man]] hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste,
his tongue to conceive, nor his [[heart]] to report, what my [[dream]] was. i
will get peter quince to write a ballad of this [[dream]]: it shall be
called ‘bottom’s dream’, because it hath no bottom; and i will sing it
in the latter end of a play, before the duke. peradventure, to make it
the more gracious, i shall sing it at her [[death]].

 [_exit._]


scene ii. [[athens]]. a room in quince’s house

 enter quince, flute, snout and starveling.

quince.
have you sent to bottom’s house? is he come [[home]] yet?

starveling.
he cannot be heard of. out of [[doubt]] he is transported.

flute.
if he come not, then the play is marred. it goes not forward, doth it?

quince.
it is not possible. you have not a [[man]] in all [[athens]] able to discharge
pyramus but he.

flute.
no, he hath simply the [[best]] wit of any handicraft [[man]] in [[athens]].

quince.
yea, and the [[best]] [[person]] too, and he is a very paramour for a sweet
voice.


flute.
you must say paragon. a paramour is, [[god]] bless us, a thing of naught.

 enter snug.

snug
masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three
lords and ladies [[lady]] more [[married]]. if our [[sport]] had gone forward, we had
all been made [[men]].

flute.
o sweet bully bottom! thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his [[life]];
he could not have ’scaped sixpence a day. an the duke had not given him
sixpence a day for playing pyramus, i’ll be [[hanged]]. he would have
deserved it: sixpence a day in pyramus, or nothing.

 enter bottom.

bottom.
where are these lads? where are these hearts [[heart]]?

quince.
bottom! o most courageous day! o most [[happy]] hour!

bottom.
masters, i am to discourse wonders: but ask me not what; for if i tell
you, i am not true athenian. i will tell you everything, [[right]] as it
fell out.

quince.
let us hear, sweet bottom.

bottom.
not a word of me. all that i will tell you is, that the duke hath
dined. get your apparel together, [[good]] strings to your beards, new
ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every [[man]] look
o’er his part. for the short and the long is, our play is preferred. in
any case, let thisbe have clean linen; and let not him that plays the
lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws. and
most dear actors, [[eat]] no onions nor garlick, for we are to utter sweet
breath; and i do not [[doubt]] but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy.
no more words. away! go, away!

 [_exeunt._]


act v

scene i. [[athens]]. an apartment in the palace of theseus

 enter theseus, hippolyta, philostrate, lords [[lord]] and attendants.

hippolyta.
’tis [[strange]], my theseus, that these lovers speak of.

theseus.
more [[strange]] than true. i never may believe
these antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
more than cool [[reason]] ever comprehends.
the lunatic, the lover, and the poet
are of [[imagination]] all compact:
one sees more devils [[devil]] than vast hell can hold;
that is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
sees helen’s [[beauty]] in a brow of [[egypt]]:
the poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
doth glance from [[heaven]] to [[earth]], from [[earth]] to [[heaven]];
and as [[imagination]] bodies [[body]] forth
the forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen
turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
a local habitation and a name.
such tricks hath [[strong]] [[imagination]],
that if it would but apprehend some joy,
it comprehends some bringer of that joy.
or in the night, imagining some [[fear]],
how easy is a bush supposed a bear?

hippolyta.
but all the story of the night told over,
and all their minds [[mind]] transfigur’d so together,
more witnesseth than fancy’s images,
and grows to something of [[great]] constancy;
but, howsoever, [[strange]] and admirable.

 enter lovers: lysander, demetrius, hermia and helena.

theseus.
here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
joy, gentle [[friends]], joy and fresh days of love
accompany your hearts!

lysander.
more than to us
wait in your [[royal]] walks, your board, your bed!

theseus.
come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
to wear away this long [[age]] of three hours
between our after-supper and bed-time?
where is our usual manager of mirth?
what revels are in hand? is there no play
to ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
call philostrate.

philostrate.
here, mighty theseus.

theseus.
say, what abridgment have you for this evening?
what masque? what [[music]]? how shall we beguile
the lazy [[time]], if not with some delight?

philostrate.
there is a brief how many sports [[sport]] are ripe.
make [[choice]] of which your highness will see first.

 [_giving a paper._]

theseus.
[_reads_] ‘the [[battle]] with the centaurs, to be sung
by an athenian eunuch to the harp.’
we’ll none of that. that have i told my love
in [[glory]] of my kinsman hercules.
‘the riot of the tipsy bacchanals,
tearing the thracian singer in their rage?’
that is an old device, and it was play’d
when i from thebes came [[last]] a conqueror.
‘the thrice three muses mourning for the death
of learning, late deceas’d in beggary.’
that is some satire, keen and critical,
not sorting with a nuptial [[ceremony]].
‘a tedious brief scene of [[young]] pyramus
and his [[love]] thisbe; very tragical mirth.’
merry and tragical? tedious and brief?
that is hot ice and wondrous [[strange]] snow.
how shall we find the concord of this discord?

philostrate.
a play there is, my [[lord]], some ten words long,
which is as brief as i have known a play;
but by ten words, my [[lord]], it is too long,
which makes it tedious. for in all the play
there is not one word apt, one player fitted.
and tragical, my [[noble]] [[lord]], it is.
for pyramus therein doth kill himself,
which, when i saw rehears’d, i must confess,
made mine [[eyes]] water; but more merry tears
the passion of loud laughter never shed.

theseus.
what are they that do play it?

philostrate.
hard-handed [[men]] that [[work]] in [[athens]] here,
which never labour’d in their minds [[mind]] till now;
and now have toil’d their unbreath’d memories
with this same play against your nuptial.

theseus.
and we will hear it.

philostrate.
no, my [[noble]] [[lord]],
it is not for you: i have heard it over,
and it is nothing, nothing in the [[world]];
unless you can find [[sport]] in their intents,
extremely stretch’d and conn’d with cruel pain
to do you service.

theseus.
i will hear that play;
for never anything can be amiss
when simpleness and [[duty]] tender it.
go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies [[lady]].

 [_exit philostrate._]

hippolyta.
i [[love]] not to see wretchedness o’ercharged,
and [[duty]] in his service perishing.

theseus.
why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.

hippolyta.
he says they can do nothing in this [[kind]].

theseus.
the kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
our [[sport]] shall be to take what they mistake:
and what [[poor]] [[duty]] cannot do, [[noble]] respect
takes it in might, not [[merit]].
where i have come, [[great]] clerks have purposed
to greet me with premeditated welcomes;
where i have seen them shiver and look pale,
make periods in the midst of sentences,
throttle their practis’d accent in their fears [[fear]],
and, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
not paying me a welcome. trust me, sweet,
out of this [[silence]] yet i pick’d a welcome;
and in the modesty of fearful duty
i [[read]] as much as from the rattling tongue
of saucy and audacious eloquence.
love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
in least speak most to my capacity.

 enter philostrate.

philostrate.
so please your grace, the prologue is address’d.

theseus.
let him approach.

 flourish of trumpets. enter the prologue.

prologue
if we offend, it is with our [[good]] will.
that you should [[think]], we come not to offend,
but with [[good]] will.  to show our simple [[skill]],
that is the true beginning of our end.
consider then, we come but in despite.
we do not come, as minding to content you,
our true intent is.  all for your delight
we are not here.  that you should here repent you,
the actors are at hand, and, by their show,
you shall [[know]] all that you are like to [[know]].

theseus.
this fellow doth not stand upon points.

lysander.
he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows [[know]] not the stop. a
good [[moral]], my [[lord]]: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.

hippolyta.
indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder; a
sound, but not in [[government]].

theseus.
his [[speech]] was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all
disordered. who is next?

 enter pyramus and thisbe, wall, moonshine and lion as in dumb show.

prologue
gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
but wonder on, till [[truth]] make all things plain.
this [[man]] is pyramus, if you would [[know]];
this beauteous [[lady]] thisbe is [[certain]].
this [[man]], with lime and rough-cast, doth present
wall, that vile wall which did these lovers sunder;
and through wall’s chink, [[poor]] souls [[soul]], they are content
to whisper, at the which let no [[man]] wonder.
this [[man]], with lanthern, dog, and bush of thorn,
presenteth moonshine, for, if you will [[know]],
by moonshine did these lovers [[think]] no scorn
to meet at ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo.
this grisly beast (which lion hight by name)
the trusty thisbe, coming first by night,
did scare away, or rather did affright;
and as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
anon comes pyramus, sweet [[youth]], and tall,
and finds his trusty thisbe’s mantle slain;
whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
he bravely broach’d his boiling bloody breast;
and thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,
his dagger drew, and died. for all the rest,
let lion, moonshine, wall, and lovers twain,
at large discourse while here they do remain.

 [_exeunt prologue, pyramus, thisbe, lion and moonshine._]

theseus.
i wonder if the lion be to speak.

demetrius.
no wonder, my [[lord]]. one lion may, when many asses do.

wall.
in this same interlude it doth befall
that i, one snout by name, [[present]] a wall:
and such a wall as i would have you think
that had in it a crannied hole or chink,
through which the lovers, pyramus and thisbe,
did whisper often very secretly.
this loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show
that i am that same wall; the [[truth]] is so:
and this the cranny is, [[right]] and sinister,
through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.

theseus.
would you [[desire]] lime and hair to speak [[better]]?

demetrius.
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse, my [[lord]].

theseus.
pyramus draws near the wall; [[silence]].

 enter pyramus.

pyramus.
o grim-look’d night! o night with hue so black!
o night, which ever art [[arts]] when day is not!
o night, o night, alack, alack, alack,
i [[fear]] my thisbe’s promise is forgot!
and thou, o wall, o sweet, o lovely wall,
that stand’st between her father’s ground and mine;
thou wall, o wall, o sweet and lovely wall,
show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.

 [_wall holds up his fingers._]

thanks, courteous wall: jove shield thee well for this!
but what see i? no thisbe do i see.
o wicked wall, through whom i see no bliss,
curs’d be thy stones for thus deceiving me!

theseus.
the wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.

pyramus.
no, in [[truth]], sir, he should not. ‘deceiving me’ is thisbe’s cue: she
is to enter now, and i am to spy her through the wall. you shall see it
will fall pat as i told you. yonder she comes.

 enter thisbe.

thisbe.
o wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
for parting my [[fair]] pyramus and me.
my cherry lips have often kiss’d thy stones,
thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.

pyramus.
i see a voice; now will i to the chink,
to spy an i can hear my thisbe’s face.
thisbe?

thisbe.
my [[love]] thou art [[arts]], my [[love]] i [[think]].

pyramus.
think what thou wilt, i am thy lover’s grace;
and like limander am i trusty still.

thisbe.
and i like helen, till the fates [[fate]] me kill.

pyramus.
not shafalus to procrus was so true.

thisbe.
as shafalus to procrus, i to you.

pyramus.
o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.

thisbe.
i kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all.

pyramus.
wilt thou at ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?

thisbe.
’tide [[life]], ’tide [[death]], i come without delay.

wall.
thus have i, wall, my part discharged so;
and, being done, thus wall away doth go.

 [_exeunt wall, pyramus and thisbe._]

theseus.
now is the mural down between the two neighbours.

demetrius.
no remedy, my [[lord]], when walls are so wilful to hear without warning.

hippolyta.
this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard.

theseus.
the [[best]] in this [[kind]] are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if
imagination amend them.

hippolyta.
it must be your [[imagination]] then, and not theirs.

theseus.
if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass
for excellent [[men]]. here come two [[noble]] beasts in, a [[man]] and a lion.

 enter lion and moonshine.

lion.
you, ladies [[lady]], you, whose gentle hearts [[heart]] do fear
the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
may now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,
when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
then [[know]] that i, one snug the joiner, am
a lion fell, nor else no lion’s dam;
for if i should as lion come in strife
into this place, ’twere [[pity]] on my [[life]].

theseus.
a very gentle beast, and of a [[good]] [[conscience]].

demetrius.
the very [[best]] at a beast, my [[lord]], that e’er i saw.

lysander.
this lion is a very fox for his valour.

theseus.
true; and a goose for his discretion.

demetrius.
not so, my [[lord]], for his valour cannot carry his discretion, and the
fox carries the goose.

theseus.
his discretion, i am sure, cannot carry his valour; for the goose
carries not the fox. it is well; leave it to his discretion, and let us
listen to the moon.

moonshine.
this lanthorn doth the hornèd moon [[present]].

demetrius.
he should have worn the horns on his head.

theseus.
he is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the
circumference.

moonshine.
this lanthorn doth the hornèd moon [[present]];
myself the [[man]] i’ the moon do seem to be.

theseus.
this is the [[greatest]] error of all the rest; the [[man]] should be put into
the lantern. how is it else the [[man]] i’ the moon?

demetrius.
he dares not come there for the candle, for you see, it is already in
snuff.

hippolyta.
i am aweary of this moon. would he would change!

theseus.
it appears by his small [[light]] of discretion that he is in the wane; but
yet, in courtesy, in all [[reason]], we must stay the [[time]].

lysander.
proceed, moon.

moon
all that i have to say, is to tell you that the lantern is the moon; i
the [[man]] i’ the moon; this thorn-bush my thorn-bush; and this dog my
dog.

demetrius.
why, all these should be in the lantern, for all these are in the moon.
but [[silence]]; here comes thisbe.

 enter thisbe.

thisbe.
this is old ninny’s tomb. where is my [[love]]?

lion.
oh!

 [_the lion roars, thisbe runs off._]

demetrius.
well roared, lion.

theseus.
well run, thisbe.

hippolyta.
well shone, moon. truly, the moon shines with a [[good]] grace.

 [_the lion tears thisbe’s mantle, and exit._]

theseus.
well moused, lion.

demetrius.
and then came pyramus.

lysander.
and so the lion vanished.

 enter pyramus.

pyramus.
sweet moon, i thank thee for thy sunny beams;
i thank thee, moon, for shining now so bright;
for, by thy gracious golden, glittering gleams,
i trust to take of truest thisbe sight.
             but stay! o spite!
             but mark, [[poor]] knight,
         what dreadful dole is here!
             [[eyes]], do you see?
             how can it be?
         o dainty duck! o dear!
             thy mantle [[good]],
             what, stained with [[blood]]?
         approach, ye furies fell!
             o fates [[fate]], come, come;
             cut thread and thrum;
         quail, rush, conclude, and quell!

theseus.
this passion, and the [[death]] of a dear friend, would go near to make a
man look [[sad]].

hippolyta.
beshrew my [[heart]], but i [[pity]] the [[man]].

pyramus.
o wherefore, [[nature]], didst thou lions frame,
since lion vile hath here deflower’d my dear?
which is—no, no—which was the fairest dame
that liv’d, that lov’d, that lik’d, that look’d with cheer.
             come, tears, confound!
             out, [[sword]], and wound
         the pap of pyramus;
             ay, that left pap,
             where [[heart]] doth hop:
         thus [[die]] i, thus, thus, thus.
             now am i [[dead]],
             now am i fled;
         my [[soul]] is in the [[sky]].
             tongue, lose thy light!
             moon, take thy flight!
         now [[die]], [[die]], [[die]], [[die]], [[die]].

 [_dies. exit moonshine._]

demetrius.
no [[die]], but an ace, for him; for he is but one.

lysander.
less than an ace, [[man]]; for he is [[dead]], he is nothing.

theseus.
with the [[help]] of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass.

hippolyta.
how [[chance]] moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her
lover?


theseus.
she will find him by starlight.

 enter thisbe.

here she comes, and her passion ends the play.

hippolyta.
methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus. i [[hope]] she
will be brief.

demetrius.
a mote will turn the balance, which pyramus, which thisbe, is the
better: he for a [[man]], [[god]] warrant us; she for a woman, [[god]] bless us!

lysander.
she hath spied him already with those sweet [[eyes]].

demetrius.
and thus she means, _videlicet_—

thisbe.
             asleep, my [[love]]?
             what, [[dead]], my dove?
         o pyramus, arise,
             speak, speak. quite dumb?
             [[dead]], [[dead]]? a tomb
         must cover thy sweet [[eyes]].
             these lily lips,
             this cherry nose,
         these yellow cowslip cheeks,
             are gone, are gone!
             lovers, make moan;
         his [[eyes]] were green as leeks.
             o sisters three,
             come, come to me,
         with hands as pale as milk;
             lay them in gore,
             since you have shore
         with shears his thread of silk.
             tongue, not a word:
             come, trusty [[sword]],
         come, blade, my breast imbrue;
             and farewell, [[friends]].
             thus thisbe ends.
         adieu, adieu, adieu.

 [_dies._]

theseus.
moonshine and lion are left to bury the [[dead]].

demetrius.
ay, and wall too.

bottom.
no, i assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers [[father]]. will it
please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a bergomask dance between
two of our company?

theseus.
no epilogue, i [[pray]] you; for your play needs no excuse. never excuse;
for when the players are all [[dead]] there need none to be blamed. [[marry]],
if he that writ it had played pyramus, and [[hanged]] himself in thisbe’s
garter, it would have been a fine tragedy; and so it is, truly; and
very notably discharged. but come, your bergomask; let your epilogue
alone.

 [_here a dance of clowns._]

the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.
lovers, to bed; ’tis almost fairy [[time]].
i [[fear]] we shall outsleep the coming morn
as much as we this night have overwatch’d.
this palpable-gross play hath well beguil’d
the heavy gait of night. sweet [[friends]], to bed.
a fortnight hold we this solemnity
in nightly revels and new jollity.

 [_exeunt._]

 enter puck.

puck.
   now the hungry lion roars,
      and the wolf behowls the moon;
   whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
      all with weary task fordone.
   now the wasted brands do glow,
      whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
   puts the wretch that lies [[lie]] in woe
      in remembrance of a shroud.
   now it is the [[time]] of night
      that the graves, all gaping wide,
   every one lets forth his sprite,
      in the church-way paths to glide.
   and we fairies, that do run
      by the triple hecate’s team
   from the presence of the sun,
      following darkness like a [[dream]],
   now are frolic; not a mouse
      shall disturb this hallow’d house.
   i am sent with broom before,
      to sweep the dust behind the door.

 enter oberon and titania with their train.

oberon.
   through the house give glimmering [[light]],
        by the [[dead]] and drowsy [[fire]].
   every elf and fairy sprite
        hop as [[light]] as bird from brier,
   and this ditty after me,
   sing and dance it trippingly.

titania.
   first rehearse your [[song]] by rote,
        to each word a warbling note;
   hand in hand, with fairy grace,
   will we sing, and bless this place.

 [_song and dance._]

oberon.
   now, until the break of day,
   through this house each fairy stray.
   to the [[best]] bride-bed will we,
   which by us shall blessèd be;
   and the issue there create
   ever shall be fortunate.
   so shall all the couples three
   ever true in loving be;
   and the blots of nature’s hand
   shall not in their issue stand:
   never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,
   nor mark prodigious, such as are
   despised in nativity,
   shall upon their [[children]] be.
   with this field-dew consecrate,
   every fairy take his gait,
   and each several chamber bless,

puck.
   if we shadows have offended,
   [[think]] but this, and all is mended,
   that you have but slumber’d here
   while these visions did appear.
   and this [[weak]] and idle theme,
   no more yielding but a [[dream]],
   gentles, do not reprehend.
   if you pardon, we will mend.
   and, as i am an honest puck,
   if we have unearnèd luck
   now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,
   we will make amends ere long;
   else the puck a liar call.
   so, [[good]] night unto you all.
   give me your hands, if we be [[friends]],
   and robin shall restore amends.
