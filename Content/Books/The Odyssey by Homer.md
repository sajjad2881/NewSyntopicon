book i

tell me, o muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide
after he had sacked the famous town of troy. many cities [[city]] did he visit,
and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted;
moreover he [[suffered]] much by sea while trying to save his own life
and bring his [[men]] safely [[home]]; but do what he might he could not save
his [[men]], for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating
the cattle of the sun-god hyperion; so the [[god]] prevented them from
ever reaching [[home]]. tell me, too, about all these things, o daughter
of jove, from whatsoever source you may [[know]] them. 

so now all who escaped [[death]] in [[battle]] or by shipwreck had got safely
home except [[ulysses]], and he, though he was longing to return to his
wife and [[country]], was detained by the [[goddess]] calypso, who had got
him into a large cave and wanted to [[marry]] him. but as years went by,
there came a [[time]] when the gods settled that he should go back to
ithaca; even then, however, when he was among his own [[people]], his
troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun
to [[pity]] him except [[neptune]], who still persecuted him without ceasing
and would not let him get [[home]]. 

now [[neptune]] had gone off to the ethiopians, who are at the world's
end, and [[lie]] in two halves, the one looking west and the other east.
he had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was
enjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house
of olympian jove, and the sire of gods and [[men]] spoke first. at that
moment he was thinking of aegisthus, who had been killed by agamemnon's
son orestes; so he said to the other gods: 

"see now, how [[men]] lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing
but their own folly. look at aegisthus; he must needs make [[love]] to
agamemnon's [[wife]] unrighteously and then kill [[agamemnon]], though he
knew it would be the [[death]] of him; for i sent mercury to warn him
not to do either of these things, inasmuch as orestes would be sure
to take his [[revenge]] when he grew up and wanted to return [[home]]. mercury
told him this in all [[good]] will but he would not listen, and now he
has paid for everything in full." 

then minerva said, "father, [[son]] of saturn, [[king]] of kings [[king]], it served
aegisthus [[right]], and so it would any one else who does as he did;
but aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for [[ulysses]] that my
heart bleeds, when i [[think]] of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt
island, far away, [[poor]] [[man]], from all his [[friends]]. it is an island
covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess
lives there, [[daughter]] of the magician atlas, who looks after the bottom
of the ocean, and carries the [[great]] columns that keep [[heaven]] and earth
asunder. this [[daughter]] of atlas has got hold of [[poor]] unhappy [[ulysses]],
and keeps trying by every [[kind]] of blandishment to make him forget
his [[home]], so that he is tired of [[life]], and thinks [[think]] of nothing but how
he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. you, sir, take
no heed of this, and yet when [[ulysses]] was before troy did he not propitiate
you with many a burnt [[sacrifice]]? why then should you keep on being
so angry with him?" 

and jove said, "my child, what are you talking about? how can i forget
ulysses than whom there is no more capable [[man]] on [[earth]], nor more
liberal in his offerings to the [[immortal]] gods that [[live]] in [[heaven]]?
bear in [[mind]], however, that [[neptune]] is still furious with ulysses
for having blinded an eye of polyphemus [[king]] of the cyclopes. polyphemus
is [[son]] to [[neptune]] by the [[nymph]] thoosa, [[daughter]] to the sea-king phorcys;
therefore though he will not kill [[ulysses]] outright, he torments him
by preventing him from getting [[home]]. still, let us lay our heads together
and see how we can [[help]] him to return; [[neptune]] will then be pacified,
for if we are all of a [[mind]] he can hardly stand out against us."

and minerva said, "father, [[son]] of saturn, [[king]] of kings [[king]], if, then,
the gods now mean that [[ulysses]] should get [[home]], we should first send
mercury to the ogygian island to tell calypso that we have made up
our minds [[mind]] and that he is to return. in the meantime i will go to ithaca,
to put [[heart]] into ulysses' [[son]] telemachus; i will embolden him to
call the achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his
mother penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep
and oxen; i will also conduct him to sparta and to pylos, to see if
he can hear anything about the return of his dear father- for this
will make [[people]] speak well of him." 

so saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,
with which she can fly like the wind over [[land]] or sea; she grasped
the redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and [[strong]],
wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her,
and down she darted from the topmost summits of [[olympus]], whereon forthwith
she was in ithaca, at the gateway of ulysses' house, disguised as
a visitor, mentes, [[chief]] of the taphians, and she held a bronze spear
in her hand. there she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of
the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in
front of the house. men-servants and pages were bustling about to
wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some
cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again,
and some cutting up [[great]] quantities of meat. 

telemachus saw her long before any one else did. he was sitting moodily
among the suitors thinking about his brave [[father]], and how he would
send them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again
and be honoured as in days gone by. thus brooding as he sat among
them, he caught sight of minerva and went straight to the gate, for
he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance.
he took her [[right]] hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear.
"welcome," said he, "to our house, and when you have partaken of food
you shall tell us what you have come for." 

he [[led]] the way as he spoke, and minerva followed him. when they were
within he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a
strong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy
father, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which
he threw a cloth of damask. there was a footstool also for her feet,
and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors,
that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence,
and that he might ask her more freely about his [[father]]. 

a maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer
and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and
she drew a clean table beside them. an upper servant brought them
bread, and offered them many [[good]] things of what there was in the
house, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set
cups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and
poured it out for them. 

then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and
seats. forthwith [[men]] servants poured water over their hands, maids
went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with
wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the [[good]] things that
were before them. as soon as they had had enough to [[eat]] and drink
they wanted [[music]] and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments
of a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to phemius, whom they compelled
perforce to sing to them. as soon as he touched his lyre and began
to sing telemachus spoke low to minerva, with his head close to hers
that no [[man]] might hear. 

"i [[hope]], sir," said he, "that you will not be offended with what i
am going to say. singing comes cheap to those who do not [[pay]] for it,
and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones [[lie]] rotting in
some wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. if these [[men]] were
to see my [[father]] come back to ithaca they would [[pray]] for longer legs
rather than a longer purse, for [[money]] would not serve them; but he,
alas, has fallen on an ill [[fate]], and even when [[people]] do sometimes
say that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see
him again. and now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and
where you come from. tell me of your town and parents, what manner
of ship you came in, how your crew brought you to ithaca, and of what
nation they declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by
land. tell me also truly, for i want to [[know]], are you a stranger to
this house, or have you been here in my father's [[time]]? in the old
days we had many visitors for my [[father]] went about much himself."

and minerva answered, "i will tell you truly and particularly all
about it. i am mentes, [[son]] of anchialus, and i am [[king]] of the taphians.
i have come here with my ship and crew, on a [[voyage]] to [[men]] of a foreign
tongue being bound for temesa with a cargo of iron, and i shall bring
back copper. as for my ship, it lies [[lie]] over yonder off the open country
away from the town, in the harbour rheithron under the wooded mountain
neritum. our fathers [[father]] were [[friends]] before us, as old laertes will tell
you, if you will go and ask him. they say, however, that he never
comes to town now, and lives [[life]] by himself in the [[country]], faring hardly,
with an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when
he comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. they told me
your [[father]] was at [[home]] again, and that was why i came, but it seems
the gods are still keeping him back, for he is not [[dead]] yet not on
the mainland. it is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid
ocean, or a [[prisoner]] among savages who are detaining him against his
will i am no [[prophet]], and [[know]] very little about omens, but i speak
as it is borne in upon me from [[heaven]], and assure you that he will
not be away much longer; for he is a [[man]] of such resource that even
though he were in chains of iron he would find some means of getting
home again. but tell me, and tell me true, can [[ulysses]] really have
such a fine looking fellow for a [[son]]? you are indeed wonderfully like
him about the head and [[eyes]], for we were close [[friends]] before he set
sail for troy where the flower of all the argives went also. since
that [[time]] we have never either of us seen the other." 

"my [[mother]]," answered telemachus, tells me i am [[son]] to [[ulysses]], but
it is a [[wise]] child that knows [[know]] his own [[father]]. would that i were son
to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask
me, there is no more ill-starred [[man]] under [[heaven]] than he who they
tell me is my [[father]]." 

and minerva said, "there is no [[fear]] of your [[race]] dying out yet, while
penelope has such a fine [[son]] as you are. but tell me, and tell me
true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these
people? what is it all about? have you some banquet, or is there a
wedding in the family- for no one seems to be bringing any provisions
of his own? and the guests- how atrociously they are behaving; what
riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable
person who comes near them." 

"sir," said telemachus, "as regards your [[question]], so long as my father
was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their
displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more
closely than mortal [[man]] was ever yet hidden. i could have borne it
better even though he were [[dead]], if he had fallen with his [[men]] before
troy, or had died with [[friends]] around him when the days of his fighting
were done; for then the achaeans would have built a mound over his
ashes, and i should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the
storm-winds have spirited him away we [[know]] not wither; he is gone
without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and i inherit nothing
but dismay. nor does the matter end simply with [[grief]] for the loss
of my [[father]]; [[heaven]] has laid sorrows [[sorrow]] upon me of yet another [[kind]];
for the chiefs [[chief]] from all our islands, dulichium, same, and the woodland
island of zacynthus, as also all the principal [[men]] of ithaca itself,
are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to
my [[mother]], who will neither point blank say that she will not [[marry]],
nor yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate,
and before long will do so also with myself." 

"is that so?" exclaimed minerva, "then you do indeed want ulysses
home again. give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and
if he is the [[man]] he was when i first knew him in our house, drinking
and making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally
suitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. he was
then coming from ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows
from ilus, [[son]] of mermerus. ilus feared the ever-living gods and would
not give him any, but my [[father]] let him have some, for he was very
fond of him. if [[ulysses]] is the [[man]] he then was these suitors will
have a short shrift and a [[sorry]] wedding. 

"but there! it rests with [[heaven]] to determine whether he is to return,
and take his [[revenge]] in his own house or no; i would, however, urge
you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. take
my [[advice]], call the achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your
case before them, and call [[heaven]] to bear you witness. bid the suitors
take themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother's mind
is set on marrying again, let her go back to her [[father]], who will
find her a husband and provide her with all the [[marriage]] gifts that
so dear a [[daughter]] may expect. as for yourself, let me prevail upon
you to take the [[best]] ship you can get, with a crew of twenty [[men]],
and go in quest of your [[father]] who has so long been missing. some
one may tell you something, or (and [[people]] often hear things in this
way) some heaven-sent message may direct you. first go to pylos and
ask nestor; thence go on to sparta and visit menelaus, for he got
home [[last]] of all the achaeans; if you hear that your [[father]] is alive
and on his way [[home]], you can put up with the waste these suitors will
make for yet another twelve months. if on the other hand you hear
of his [[death]], come [[home]] at once, celebrate his [[funeral]] rites with
all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your [[mother]] marry
again. then, having done all this, [[think]] it well over in your mind
how, by [[fair]] means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own
house. you are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard
how [[people]] are singing orestes' praises [[praise]] for having killed his father's
murderer aegisthus? you are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your
mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. now, however, i must
go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if i keep
them waiting longer; [[think]] the matter over for yourself, and remember
what i have said to you." 

"sir," answered telemachus, "it has been very [[kind]] of you to talk
to me in this way, as though i were your own [[son]], and i will do all
you tell me; i [[know]] you want to be getting on with your [[voyage]], but
stay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself.
i will then give you a [[present]], and you shall go on your way rejoicing;
i will give you one of [[great]] [[beauty]] and value- a keepsake such as
only dear [[friends]] give to one another." 

minerva answered, "do not try to keep me, for i would be on my way
at once. as for any [[present]] you may be disposed to make me, keep it
till i come again, and i will take it [[home]] with me. you shall give
me a very [[good]] one, and i will give you one of no less value in return."

with these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had
given telemachus [[courage]], and had made him [[think]] more than ever about
his [[father]]. he [[felt]] the [[change]], wondered at it, and knew that the
stranger had been a [[god]], so he went straight to where the suitors
were sitting. 

phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in [[silence]] as
he told the [[sad]] tale of the return from troy, and the ills minerva
had laid upon the achaeans. penelope, [[daughter]] of icarius, heard his
song from her room upstairs, and came down by the [[great]] staircase,
not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. when she reached
the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the
roof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. she
held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.

"phemius," she cried, "you [[know]] many another feat of gods and heroes,
such as poets [[love]] to celebrate. sing the suitors some one of these,
and let them drink their wine in [[silence]], but cease this [[sad]] tale,
for it breaks my sorrowful [[heart]], and reminds me of my lost husband
whom i mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was [[great]] over all
hellas and middle argos." 

"mother," answered telemachus, "let the bard sing what he has a mind
to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is jove, not they,
who makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon [[mankind]] according to
his own [[good]] [[pleasure]]. this fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated
return of the danaans, for [[people]] always applaud the latest songs
most warmly. make up your [[mind]] to it and bear it; [[ulysses]] is not the
only [[man]] who never came back from troy, but many another went down
as well as he. go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your
daily duties [[duty]], your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants;
for [[speech]] is man's [[man]] matter, and mine above all others- for it is i
who am master here." 

she went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying
in her [[heart]]. then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,
she mourned her dear husband till minerva shed sweet sleep over her
eyes. but the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters,
and prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow. 

then telemachus spoke, "shameless," he cried, "and insolent suitors,
let us feast at our [[pleasure]] now, and let there be no brawling, for
it is a rare thing to hear a [[man]] with such a [[divine]] voice as phemius
has; but in the morning meet me in full assembly that i may give you
formal notice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and
turn about, at your own cost. if on the other hand you choose to persist
in spunging upon one [[man]], [[heaven]] [[help]] me, but jove shall reckon with
you in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be
no [[man]] to avenge you." 

the suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the
boldness of his [[speech]]. then, antinous, [[son]] of eupeithes, said, "the
gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may
jove never grant you to be [[chief]] in ithaca as your [[father]] was before
you." 

telemachus answered, "antinous, do not chide with me, but, [[god]] willing,
i will be [[chief]] too if i can. is this the worst [[fate]] you can think
of for me? it is no [[bad]] thing to be a [[chief]], for it brings both riches
and [[honour]]. still, now that [[ulysses]] is [[dead]] there are many [[great]] men
in ithaca both old and [[young]], and some other may take the lead among
them; nevertheless i will be [[chief]] in my own house, and will rule
those whom [[ulysses]] has won for me." 

then eurymachus, [[son]] of polybus, answered, "it rests with [[heaven]] to
decide who shall be [[chief]] among us, but you shall be master in your
own house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man
in ithaca shall do you [[violence]] nor rob you. and now, my [[good]] fellow,
i want to [[know]] about this stranger. what [[country]] does he come from?
of what [[family]] is he, and where is his estate? has he brought you
news about the return of your [[father]], or was he on [[business]] of his
own? he seemed a well-to-do [[man]], but he hurried off so suddenly that
he was gone in a moment before we could get to [[know]] him."

"my [[father]] is [[dead]] and gone," answered telemachus, "and even if some
rumour reaches me i put no more [[faith]] in it now. my [[mother]] does indeed
sometimes send for a soothsayer and [[question]] him, but i give his prophecyings
no heed. as for the stranger, he was mentes, [[son]] of anchialus, chief
of the taphians, an old friend of my father's." but in his [[heart]] he
knew that it had been the [[goddess]]. 

the suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening;
but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went [[home]] to bed each
in his own abode. telemachus's room was high up in a tower that looked
on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and full of
thought. a [[good]] old woman, euryclea, [[daughter]] of ops, the [[son]] of pisenor,
went before him with a couple of blazing torches. laertes had bought
her with his own [[money]] when she was quite [[young]]; he gave the worth
of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much [[respect]] to her in his household
as he did to his own wedded [[wife]], but he did not take her to his bed
for he feared his wife's resentment. she it was who now lighted telemachus
to his room, and she loved him [[better]] than any of the other women
in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. he opened
the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as he took off
his shirt he gave it to the [[good]] old woman, who folded it tidily up,
and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after which she went
out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt home
by means of the strap. but telemachus as he lay covered with a woollen
fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended [[voyage]] of the
counsel that minerva had given him. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book ii

now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, telemachus
rose and dressed himself. he bound his sandals on to his comely feet,
girded his [[sword]] about his shoulder, and left his room looking like
an [[immortal]] [[god]]. he at once sent the criers round to call the people
in assembly, so they called them and the [[people]] gathered thereon;
then, when they were got together, he went to the place of assembly
spear in hand- not alone, for his two hounds went with him. minerva
endowed him with a presence of such [[divine]] comeliness that all marvelled
at him as he went by, and when he took his place' in his father's
seat even the oldest councillors made way for him. 

aegyptius, a [[man]] bent double with [[age]], and of infinite [[experience]],
the first to speak his [[son]] antiphus had gone with [[ulysses]] to ilius,
land of [[noble]] steeds, but the savage cyclops had killed him when they
were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his [[last]] dinner for him,
he had three sons [[son]] left, of whom two still worked on their father's
land, while the third, eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless
their [[father]] could not get over the loss of antiphus, and was still
weeping for him when he began his [[speech]]. 

"men of ithaca," he said, "hear my words. from the day [[ulysses]] left
us there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then
can it be, whether old or [[young]], that finds it so necessary to convene
us? has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he [[wish]] to
warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of [[public]] moment?
i am sure he is an excellent [[person]], and i [[hope]] jove will grant him
his heart's [[desire]]." 

telemachus took this [[speech]] as of [[good]] omen and rose at once, for
he was bursting with what he had to say. he stood in the middle of
the assembly and the [[good]] herald pisenor brought him his staff. then,
turning to aegyptius, "sir," said he, "it is i, as you will shortly
learn, who have convened you, for it is i who am the most aggrieved.
i have not got wind of any host approaching about which i would warn
you, nor is there any matter of [[public]] moment on which i would speak.
my grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two [[great]] misfortunes
which have fallen upon my house. the first of these is the loss of
my excellent [[father]], who was [[chief]] among all you here [[present]], and
was like a [[father]] to every one of you; the second is much more serious,
and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. the sons [[son]] of all
the [[chief]] [[men]] among you are pestering my [[mother]] to [[marry]] them against
her will. they are afraid to go to her [[father]] icarius, asking him
to choose the one he likes [[best]], and to provide [[marriage]] gifts for
his [[daughter]], but day by day they keep hanging about my father's house,
sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and
never giving so much as a [[thought]] to the quantity of wine they drink.
no estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no [[ulysses]] to ward
off harm from our doors, and i cannot hold my own against them. i
shall never all my days be as [[good]] a [[man]] as he was, still i would
indeed defend myself if i had [[power]] to do so, for i cannot stand such
treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. have
respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to [[public]] [[opinion]].
fear, too, the wrath of [[heaven]], lest the gods should be displeased
and turn upon you. i [[pray]] you by jove and themis, who is the beginning
and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my [[friends]], and leave
me singlehanded- unless it be that my brave [[father]] [[ulysses]] did some
wrong to the achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by aiding
and abetting these suitors. moreover, if i am to be eaten out of house
and [[home]] at all, i had rather you did the eating yourselves, for i
could then take action against you to some [[purpose]], and serve you
with notices from house to house till i got paid in full, whereas
now i have no remedy." 

with this telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into
tears. every one was very [[sorry]] for him, but they all sat still and
no one ventured to make him an angry [[answer]], save only antinous, who
spoke thus: 

"telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw
the blame upon us suitors? it is your mother's [[fault]] not ours, for
she is a very artful woman. this three years [[past]], and close on four,
she has been driving us out of our minds [[mind]], by encouraging each one
of us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she
says. and then there was that other trick she played us. she set up
a [[great]] tambour frame in her room, and began to [[work]] on an enormous
piece of fine needlework. 'sweet hearts [[heart]],' said she, 'ulysses is indeed
dead, still do not press me to [[marry]] again immediately, wait- for
i would not have [[skill]] in needlework perish unrecorded- till i have
completed a pall for the hero laertes, to be in readiness against
the [[time]] when [[death]] shall take him. he is very [[rich]], and the women
of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.'

"this was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her
working on her [[great]] web all day long, but at night she would unpick
the stitches again by torchlight. she fooled us in this way for three
years and we never found her out, but as [[time]] wore on and she was
now in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing
told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her [[work]], so she
had to finish it whether she would or no. the suitors, therefore,
make you this [[answer]], that both you and the achaeans may understand-'send
your [[mother]] away, and bid her [[marry]] the [[man]] of her own and of her
father's choice'; for i do not [[know]] what will happen if she goes on
plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score
of the accomplishments minerva has taught her, and because she is
so clever. we never yet heard of such a woman; we [[know]] all about tyro,
alcmena, mycene, and the famous [[women]] of old, but they were nothing
to your [[mother]], any one of them. it was not [[fair]] of her to treat us
in that way, and as long as she continues in the [[mind]] with which heaven
has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up your estate;
and i do not see why she should [[change]], for she gets all the honour
and [[glory]], and it is you who [[pay]] for it, not she. [[understand]], then,
that we will not go back to our lands [[land]], neither here nor elsewhere,
till she has made her [[choice]] and [[married]] some one or other of us."

telemachus answered, "antinous, how can i drive the [[mother]] who bore
me from my father's house? my [[father]] is abroad and we do not know
whether he is alive or [[dead]]. it will be hard on me if i have to pay
icarius the large sum which i must give him if i insist on sending
his [[daughter]] back to him. not only will he deal rigorously with me,
but [[heaven]] will also punish me; for my [[mother]] when she leaves the
house will calf on the erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not
be a creditable thing to do, and i will have nothing to say to it.
if you choose to take offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere
at one another's houses at your own cost turn and turn about. if,
on the other hand, you elect to persist in spunging upon one [[man]],
heaven [[help]] me, but jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you
fall in my father's house there shall be no [[man]] to avenge you."

as he spoke jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and
they flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own
lordly flight. when they were [[right]] over the middle of the assembly
they wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and
glaring [[death]] into the [[eyes]] of them that were below; then, fighting
fiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right
over the town. the [[people]] wondered as they saw them, and [[asked]] each
other what an this might be; whereon halitherses, who was the best
prophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and
in all honesty, saying: 

"hear me, [[men]] of ithaca, and i speak more particularly to the suitors,
for i see mischief brewing for them. [[ulysses]] is not going to be away
much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out [[death]] and destruction,
not on them alone, but on many another of us who [[live]] in ithaca. let
us then be [[wise]] in [[time]], and put a stop to this wickedness before
he comes. let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will be better
for them, for i am not prophesying without due [[knowledge]]; everything
has happened to [[ulysses]] as i foretold when the argives set out for
troy, and he with them. i said that after going through much hardship
and losing all his [[men]] he should come [[home]] again in the twentieth
year and that no one would [[know]] him; and now all this is coming true."

eurymachus [[son]] of polybus then said, "go [[home]], old [[man]], and prophesy
to your own [[children]], or it may be worse for them. i can [[read]] these
omens myself much [[better]] than you can; birds are always flying about
in the sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything.
ulysses has died in a far [[country]], and it is a [[pity]] you are not dead
along with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel
to the anger of telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. i suppose
you [[think]] he will give you something for your [[family]], but i tell you-
and it shall surely be- when an old [[man]] like you, who should know
better, talks a [[young]] one over till he becomes troublesome, in the
first place his [[young]] friend will only fare so much the worse- he
will take nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this- and in
the next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you
will at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you. as for
telemachus, i warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother
back to her [[father]], who will find her a husband and provide her with
all the [[marriage]] gifts so dear a [[daughter]] may expect. till we shall
go on harassing him with our suit; for we [[fear]] no [[man]], and [[care]] neither
for him, with all his fine speeches [[speech]], nor for any fortune-telling of
yours. you may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hate
you the more. we shall go back and continue to [[eat]] up telemachus's
estate without paying him, till such [[time]] as his [[mother]] leaves off
tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of expectation,
each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare [[perfection]].
besides we cannot go after the other [[women]] whom we should [[marry]] in
due course, but for the way in which she treats us." 

then telemachus said, "eurymachus, and you other suitors, i shall
say no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people
of ithaca now [[know]] my story. give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty
men to take me hither and thither, and i will go to sparta and to
pylos in quest of my [[father]] who has so long been missing. some one
may tell me something, or (and [[people]] often hear things in this way)
some heaven-sent message may direct me. if i can hear of him as alive
and on his way [[home]] i will put up with the waste you suitors will
make for yet another twelve months. if on the other hand i hear of
his [[death]], i will return at once, celebrate his [[funeral]] rites with
all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make my [[mother]] marry
again." 

with these words he sat down, and mentor who had been a friend of
ulysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority
over the servants, rose to speak. he, then, plainly and in all honesty
addressed them thus: 

"hear me, [[men]] of ithaca, i [[hope]] that you may never have a [[kind]] and
well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably;
i [[hope]] that all your chiefs [[chief]] henceforward may be cruel and [[unjust]],
for there is not one of you but has forgotten [[ulysses]], who ruled you
as though he were your [[father]]. i am not half so angry with the suitors,
for if they choose to do [[violence]] in the naughtiness of their hearts [[heart]],
and wager their heads that [[ulysses]] will not return, they can take
the high hand and [[eat]] up his estate, but as for you others i am shocked
at the way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop
such scandalous goings on-which you could do if you chose, for you
are many and they are few." 

leiocritus, [[son]] of evenor, answered him saying, "mentor, what folly
is all this, that you should set the [[people]] to stay us? it is a hard
thing for one [[man]] to [[fight]] with many about his victuals. even though
ulysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house,
and do his [[best]] to oust us, his [[wife]], who wants him back so very badly,
would have small cause for rejoicing, and his [[blood]] would be upon
his own head if he fought against such [[great]] odds. there is no sense
in what you have been saying. now, therefore, do you [[people]] go about
your [[business]], and let his father's old [[friends]], mentor and halitherses,
speed this boy on his [[journey]], if he goes at all- which i do not think
he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes
and tells him something." 

on this he broke up the assembly, and every [[man]] went back to his own
abode, while the suitors returned to the house of [[ulysses]].

then telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in
the grey waves, and prayed to minerva. 

"hear me," he cried, "you [[god]] who visited me yesterday, and bade me
sail the seas in search of my [[father]] who has so long been missing.
i would obey you, but the achaeans, and more particularly the wicked
suitors, are hindering me that i cannot do so." 

as he thus prayed, minerva came close up to him in the likeness and
with the voice of mentor. "telemachus," said she, "if you are made
of the same stuff as your [[father]] you will be neither [[fool]] nor coward
henceforward, for [[ulysses]] never broke his word nor left his [[work]] half
done. if, then, you take after him, your [[voyage]] will not be fruitless,
but unless you have the [[blood]] of [[ulysses]] and of penelope in your veins
i see no likelihood of your succeeding. sons [[son]] are seldom as [[good]] men
as their fathers [[father]]; they are generally worse, not [[better]]; still, as
you are not going to be either [[fool]] or [[coward]] henceforward, and are
not entirely without some share of your father's [[wise]] discernment,
i look with [[hope]] upon your undertaking. but [[mind]] you never make common
cause with any of those foolish suitors, for they have neither sense
nor [[virtue]], and give no [[thought]] to [[death]] and to the doom that will
shortly fall on one and all of them, so that they shall perish on
the same day. as for your [[voyage]], it shall not be long delayed; your
father was such an old friend of mine that i will find you a ship,
and will come with you myself. now, however, return [[home]], and go about
among the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your [[voyage]];
see everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal,
which is the staff of [[life]], in leathern bags, while i go round the
town and beat up volunteers at once. there are many ships in ithaca
both old and new; i will run my eye over them for you and will choose
the [[best]]; we will get her ready and will put out to sea without delay."

thus spoke minerva [[daughter]] of jove, and telemachus lost no [[time]] in
doing as the [[goddess]] told him. he went moodily and found the suitors
flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. antinous came
up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own, saying,
"telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill [[blood]] neither in
word nor deed, but [[eat]] and drink with us as you used to do. the achaeans
will find you in everything- a ship and a picked crew to boot- so
that you can set sail for pylos at once and get news of your noble
father." 

"antinous," answered telemachus, "i cannot [[eat]] in [[peace]], nor take
pleasure of any [[kind]] with such [[men]] as you are. was it not enough that
you should waste so much [[good]] [[property]] of mine while i was yet a boy?
now that i am older and [[know]] more about it, i am also stronger, and
whether here among this [[people]], or by going to pylos, i will do you
all the harm i can. i shall go, and my going will not be in [[vain]] though,
thanks to you suitors, i have neither ship nor crew of my own, and
must be passenger not captain." 

as he spoke he snatched his hand from that of antinous. meanwhile
the others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeering
at him tauntingly as they did so. 

"telemachus," said one youngster, "means to be the [[death]] of us; i
suppose he thinks [[think]] he can bring [[friends]] to [[help]] him from pylos, or
again from sparta, where he seems bent on going. or will he go to
ephyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?"

another said, "perhaps if telemachus goes on board ship, he will be
like his [[father]] and perish far from his [[friends]]. in this case we should
have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his [[property]] amongst
us: as for the house we can let his [[mother]] and the [[man]] who marries
her have that." 

this was how they talked. but telemachus went down into the lofty
and spacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronze
lay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes
were kept in open chests. here, too, there was a store of fragrant
olive [[oil]], while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit
for a [[god]] to drink, were ranged against the wall in case [[ulysses]] should
come [[home]] again after all. the room was closed with well-made doors
opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper euryclea,
daughter of ops the [[son]] of pisenor, was in charge of everything both
night and day. telemachus called her to the store-room and said:

"nurse, draw me off some of the [[best]] wine you have, after what you
are keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, [[poor]] [[man]], he should
escape [[death]], and find his way [[home]] again after all. let me have twelve
jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn
leathern bags with barley meal- about twenty measures in all. get
these things put together at once, and say nothing about it. i will
take everything away this evening as soon as my [[mother]] has gone upstairs
for the night. i am going to sparta and to pylos to see if i can hear
anything about the return of my dear [[father]]. 

when euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him,
saying, "my dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that
into your head? where in the [[world]] do you want to go to- you, who
are the one [[hope]] of the house? your [[poor]] [[father]] is [[dead]] and gone in
some [[foreign]] [[country]] nobody knows [[know]] where, and as soon as your back
is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out
of the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves;
stay where you are among your own [[people]], and do not go wandering
and worrying your [[life]] out on the barren ocean." 

"fear not, nurse," answered telemachus, "my scheme is not without
heaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this
to my [[mother]], till i have been away some ten or twelve days, unless
she hears of my having gone, and asks you; for i do not want her to
spoil her [[beauty]] by crying." 

the old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she
had completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars,
and getting the barley meal into the bags, while telemachus went back
to the suitors. 

then minerva bethought her of another matter. she took his shape,
and went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet
at the ship by sundown. she went also to noemon [[son]] of phronius, and
asked him to let her have a ship- which he was very ready to do. when
the sun had set and darkness was over all the [[land]], she got the ship
into the water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally
carry, and stationed her at the end of the harbour. presently the
crew came up, and the [[goddess]] spoke encouragingly to each of them.

furthermore she went to the house of [[ulysses]], and threw the suitors
into a deep slumber. she caused their drink to fuddle them, and made
them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting
over their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their
eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. then she took the form and voice
of mentor, and called telemachus to come outside. 

"telemachus," said she, "the [[men]] are on board and at their oars, waiting
for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off."

on this she [[led]] the way, while telemachus followed in her steps. when
they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side,
and telemachus said, "now my [[men]], [[help]] me to get the stores on board;
they are all put together in the cloister, and my [[mother]] does not
know anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one."

with these words he [[led]] the way and the others followed after. when
they had brought the things as he told them, telemachus went on board,
minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel,
while telemachus sat beside her. then the [[men]] loosed the hawsers and
took their places on the benches. minerva sent them a [[fair]] wind from
the west, that whistled over the deep blue waves whereon telemachus
told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did
as he told them. they set the mast in its socket in the cross plank,
raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted
their [[white]] sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. as the sail
bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue water,
and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. then they
made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls to the
brim, and made drink offerings to the [[immortal]] gods that are from
everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed [[daughter]] of jove.

thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night
from dark till dawn. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book iii

but as the sun was rising from the [[fair]] sea into the firmament of
heaven to shed [[light]] on mortals and immortals [[immortal]], they reached pylos
the [[city]] of neleus. now the [[people]] of pylos were gathered on the sea
shore to offer [[sacrifice]] of black bulls to [[neptune]] [[lord]] of the earthquake.
there were nine guilds with five hundred [[men]] in each, and there were
nine bulls to each guild. as they were eating the inward meats and
burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of [[neptune]], telemachus
and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship to anchor,
and went ashore. 

minerva [[led]] the way and telemachus followed her. presently she said,
"telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have
taken this [[voyage]] to try and find out where your [[father]] is buried
and how he came by his end; so go straight up to nestor that we may
see what he has got to tell us. beg of him to speak the [[truth]], and
he will tell no lies [[lie]], for he is an excellent [[person]]." 

"but how, mentor," replied telemachus, "dare i go up to nestor, and
how am i to address him? i have never yet been used to holding long
conversations with [[people]], and am ashamed to begin questioning one
who is so much older than myself." 

"some things, telemachus," answered minerva, "will be suggested to
you by your own instinct, and [[heaven]] will prompt you further; for
i am assured that the gods have been with you from the [[time]] of your
birth until now." 

she then went quickly on, and telemachus followed in her steps till
they reached the place where the guilds of the pylian [[people]] were
assembled. there they found nestor sitting with his sons [[son]], while his
company round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces
of meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. when they
saw the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and
bade them take their places. nestor's [[son]] pisistratus at once offered
his hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins
that were lying on the sands near his [[father]] and his [[brother]] thrasymedes.
then he gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine
for them into a golden cup, handing it to minerva first, and saluting
her at the same [[time]]. 

"offer a prayer, sir," said he, "to [[king]] [[neptune]], for it is his feast
that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink-offering,
pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. i [[doubt]] not that
he too lifts his hands in prayer, for [[man]] cannot [[live]] without god
in the [[world]]. still he is younger than you are, and is much of an
age with myself, so i he handed i will give you the precedence."

as he spoke he handed her the cup. minerva [[thought]] it very [[right]] and
proper of him to have given it to herself first; she accordingly began
praying heartily to [[neptune]]. "o thou," she cried, "that encirclest
the [[earth]], vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call
upon thee. more especially we [[pray]] thee send down thy grace on nestor
and on his sons [[son]]; thereafter also make the rest of the pylian people
some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you.
lastly, grant telemachus and myself a [[happy]] issue, in [[respect]] of the
matter that has brought us in our to pylos." 

when she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to telemachus
and he prayed likewise. by and by, when the outer meats were roasted
and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every [[man]] his portion
and they all made an excellent dinner. as soon as they had had enough
to [[eat]] and drink, nestor, knight of gerene, began to speak.

"now," said he, "that our guests have done their dinner, it will be
best to ask them who they are. who, then, sir strangers, are you,
and from what port have you sailed? are you traders? or do you sail
the seas as rovers with your hand against every [[man]], and every man's
hand against you?" 

telemachus answered boldly, for minerva had given him [[courage]] to ask
about his [[father]] and get himself a [[good]] name. 

"nestor," said he, "son of neleus, [[honour]] to the achaean name, you
ask whence we come, and i will tell you. we come from ithaca under
neritum, and the matter about which i would speak is of private not
public import. i seek news of my unhappy [[father]] [[ulysses]], who is said
to have sacked the town of troy in company with yourself. we know
what [[fate]] befell each one of the other heroes who fought at troy,
but as regards [[ulysses]] [[heaven]] has hidden from us the [[knowledge]] even
that he is [[dead]] at all, for no one can certify us in what place he
perished, nor say whether he fell in [[battle]] on the mainland, or was
lost at sea amid the waves of amphitrite. therefore i am suppliant
at your knees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy
end, whether you saw it with your own [[eyes]], or heard it from some
other traveller, for he was a [[man]] born to trouble. do not soften things
out of any [[pity]] for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what
you saw. if my brave [[father]] [[ulysses]] ever did you [[loyal]] service, either
by word or deed, when you achaeans were harassed among the trojans,
bear it in [[mind]] now as in my favour and tell me truly all."

"my friend," answered nestor, "you recall a [[time]] of much [[sorrow]] to
my [[mind]], for the brave achaeans [[suffered]] much both at sea, while privateering
under achilles, and when fighting before the [[great]] [[city]] of [[king]] priam.
our [[best]] [[men]] all of them fell there- ajax, achilles, patroclus peer
of gods in counsel, and my own dear [[son]] antilochus, a [[man]] singularly
fleet of foot and in [[fight]] valiant. but we [[suffered]] much more than
this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? though
you were to stay here and [[question]] me for five years, or even six,
i could not tell you all that the achaeans [[suffered]], and you would
turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. nine long years did
we try every [[kind]] of stratagem, but the hand of [[heaven]] was against
us; during all this [[time]] there was no one who could compare with your
father in subtlety- if indeed you are his son- i can hardly believe
my eyes- and you talk just like him too- no one would say that people
of such different ages [[age]] could speak so much alike. he and i never had
any [[kind]] of difference from first to [[last]] neither in camp nor council,
but in singleness of [[heart]] and [[purpose]] we advised the argives how
all might be ordered for the [[best]]. 

"when however, we had sacked the [[city]] of priam, and were setting sail
in our ships as [[heaven]] had dispersed us, then jove saw fit to vex
the argives on their homeward [[voyage]]; for they had not all been either
wise or understanding, and hence many came to a [[bad]] end through the
displeasure of jove's [[daughter]] minerva, who brought about a quarrel
between the two sons [[son]] of atreus. 

"the sons [[son]] of atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be,
for it was sunset and the achaeans were heavy with wine. when they
explained why they had called- the [[people]] together, it seemed that
menelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased [[agamemnon]],
who [[thought]] that we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease
the anger of minerva. [[fool]] that he was, he might have known that he
would not prevail with her, for when the gods have made up their minds
they do not [[change]] them lightly. so the two stood bandying hard words,
whereon the achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the
air, and were of two minds [[mind]] as to what they should do. 

"that night we rested and nursed our anger, for jove was hatching
mischief against us. but in the morning some of us drew our ships
into the water and put our goods [[good]] with our [[women]] on board, while the
rest, about half in number, stayed behind with [[agamemnon]]. we- the
other half- embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven
had smoothed the sea. when we reached tenedos we offered sacrifices
to the gods, for we were longing to get [[home]]; cruel jove, however,
did not yet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel
in the course of which some among us turned their ships back again,
and sailed away under [[ulysses]] to make their [[peace]] with [[agamemnon]];
but i, and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for i
saw that mischief was brewing. the [[son]] of tydeus went on also with
me, and his crews with him. later on menelaus joined us at lesbos,
and found us making up our minds [[mind]] about our course- for we did not
know whether to go outside chios by the island of psyra, keeping this
to our left, or inside chios, over against the stormy headland of
mimas. so we [[asked]] [[heaven]] for a sign, and were shown one to the effect
that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across
the open sea to euboea. this we therefore did, and a [[fair]] wind sprang
up which gave us a quick passage during the night to geraestus, where
we offered many sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to [[neptune]] for having helped us so far
on our way. four days later diomed and his [[men]] stationed their ships
in argos, but i held on for pylos, and the wind never fell [[light]] from
the day when [[heaven]] first made it [[fair]] for me. 

"therefore, my dear [[young]] friend, i returned without hearing anything
about the others. i [[know]] neither who got [[home]] safely nor who were
lost but, as in [[duty]] bound, i will give you without reserve the reports
that have reached me since i have been here in my own house. they
say the myrmidons returned [[home]] safely under achilles' [[son]] neoptolemus;
so also did the valiant [[son]] of poias, philoctetes. idomeneus, again,
lost no [[men]] at sea, and all his followers who escaped [[death]] in the
field got safe [[home]] with him to crete. no matter how far out of the
world you [[live]], you will have heard of [[agamemnon]] and the [[bad]] end he
came to at the hands of aegisthus- and a fearful reckoning did aegisthus
presently [[pay]]. see what a [[good]] thing it is for a [[man]] to leave a son
behind him to do as orestes did, who killed false aegisthus the murderer
of his [[noble]] [[father]]. you too, then- for you are a tall, smart-looking
fellow- show your mettle and make yourself a name in story."

"nestor [[son]] of neleus," answered telemachus, "honour to the achaean
name, the achaeans applaud orestes and his name will [[live]] through
all [[time]] for he has avenged his [[father]] nobly. would that [[heaven]] might
grant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors,
who are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no
such [[happiness]] in store for me and for my [[father]], so we must bear
it as [[best]] we may." 

"my friend," said nestor, "now that you remind me, i [[remember]] to have
heard that your [[mother]] has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards
you and are making havoc of your estate. do you submit to this tamely,
or are [[public]] feeling and the voice of [[heaven]] against you? who knows
but what [[ulysses]] may come back after all, and [[pay]] these scoundrels
in full, either single-handed or with a [[force]] of achaeans behind him?
if minerva were to take as [[great]] a liking to you as she did to ulysses
when we were fighting before troy (for i never yet saw the gods so
openly fond of any one as minerva then was of your father), if she
would take as [[good]] [[care]] of you as she did of him, these wooers would
soon some of them him, forget their wooing." 

telemachus answered, "i can expect nothing of the [[kind]]; it would be
far too much to [[hope]] for. i dare not let myself [[think]] of it. even
though the gods themselves willed it no such [[good]] [[fortune]] could befall
me." 

on this minerva said, "telemachus, what are you talking about? heaven
has a long arm if it is minded to save a [[man]]; and if it were me, i
should not [[care]] how much i [[suffered]] before getting [[home]], provided
i could be safe when i was once there. i would rather this, than get
home quickly, and then be killed in my own house as [[agamemnon]] was
by the treachery of aegisthus and his [[wife]]. still, [[death]] is [[certain]],
and when a man's [[man]] hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no
matter how fond they are of him." 

"mentor," answered telemachus, "do not let us talk about it any more.
there is no [[chance]] of my father's ever coming back; the gods have
long since counselled his destruction. there is something else, however,
about which i should like to ask nestor, for he knows [[know]] much more than
any one else does. they say he has reigned for three generations [[generation]] so
that it is like talking to an [[immortal]]. tell me, therefore, nestor,
and tell me true; how did [[agamemnon]] come to [[die]] in that way? what
was menelaus doing? and how came false aegisthus to kill so far better
a [[man]] than himself? was menelaus away from achaean argos, voyaging
elsewhither among [[mankind]], that aegisthus took [[heart]] and killed [[agamemnon]]?"

"i will tell you truly," answered nestor, "and indeed you have yourself
divined how it all happened. if menelaus when he got back from troy
had found aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been
no barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was [[dead]], but he would
have been thrown outside the [[city]] to dogs and vultures, and not a
woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of [[great]] wickedness;
but we were over there, fighting hard at troy, and aegisthus who was
taking his ease quietly in the [[heart]] of argos, cajoled agamemnon's
wife clytemnestra with incessant [[flattery]]. 

"at first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for
she was of a [[good]] [[natural]] disposition; moreover there was a bard with
her, to whom [[agamemnon]] had given strict orders on setting out for
troy, that he was to keep guard over his [[wife]]; but when [[heaven]] had
counselled her destruction, aegisthus thus this bard off to a desert
island and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon- after
which she went willingly enough to the house of aegisthus. then he
offered many burnt sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to the gods, and decorated many temples
with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.

"meanwhile menelaus and i were on our way [[home]] from troy, on good
terms with one another. when we got to sunium, which is the point
of [[athens]], [[apollo]] with his painless shafts killed phrontis the steersman
of menelaus' ship (and never [[man]] knew [[better]] how to handle a vessel
in rough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in
his hand, and menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had
to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral
rites. presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed
on as far as the malean heads, jove counselled [[evil]] against him and
made it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. here he divided
his fleet and took the one half towards crete where the cydonians
dwell round about the waters of the river iardanus. there is a high
headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called
gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as phaestus the
sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arter phaestus
the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great
shelter. here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and
wrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. as for the
other five ships, they were taken by winds and seas to [[egypt]], where
menelaus gathered much gold and substance among [[people]] of an alien
speech. meanwhile aegisthus here at [[home]] plotted his [[evil]] deed. for
seven years after he had killed [[agamemnon]] he ruled in mycene, and
the [[people]] were [[obedient]] under him, but in the eighth year orestes
came back from [[athens]] to be his bane, and killed the murderer of his
father. then he celebrated the [[funeral]] rites of his [[mother]] and of
false aegisthus by a banquet to the [[people]] of argos, and on that very
day menelaus came [[home]], with as much treasure as his ships could carry.

"take my [[advice]] then, and do not go travelling about for long so far
from [[home]], nor leave your [[property]] with such dangerous [[people]] in your
house; they will [[eat]] up everything you have among them, and you will
have been on a fool's errand. still, i should advise you by all means
to go and visit menelaus, who has lately come off a [[voyage]] among such
distant peoples [[people]] as no [[man]] could ever [[hope]] to get back from, when the
winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds
cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so vast and terrible are
the seas that they must cross. go to him, therefore, by sea, and take
your own [[men]] with you; or if you would rather travel by [[land]] you can
have a chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons [[son]] who can
escort you to lacedaemon where menelaus lives [[life]]. beg of him to speak
the [[truth]], and he will tell you no lies [[lie]], for he is an excellent [[person]]."

as he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon minerva said,
"sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues
of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings
to [[neptune]], and the other immortals [[immortal]], and then go to bed, for it is
bed [[time]]. [[people]] should go away early and not keep late hours at a
religious festival." 

thus spoke the [[daughter]] of jove, and they obeyed her saying. [[men]] servants
poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the
mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving
every [[man]] his drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of the victims
into the [[fire]], and stood up to make their drink-offerings. when they
had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded,
minerva and telemachus were forgoing on board their ship, but nestor
caught them up at once and stayed them. 

"heaven and the [[immortal]] gods," he exclaimed, "forbid that you should
leave my house to go on board of a ship. do you [[think]] i am so poor
and short of clothes, or that i have so few cloaks and as to be unable
to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? let me
tell you i have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit
the [[son]] of my old friend [[ulysses]] to camp down on the deck of a ship-
not while i live- nor yet will my sons [[son]] after me, but they will keep
open house as have done." 

then minerva answered, "sir, you have spoken well, and it will be
much [[better]] that telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore,
shall return with you and sleep at your house, but i must go back
to give orders to my crew, and keep them in [[good]] [[heart]]. i am the only
older [[person]] among them; the rest are all [[young]] [[men]] of telemachus'
own [[age]], who have taken this [[voyage]] out of [[friendship]]; so i must return
to the ship and sleep there. moreover to-morrow i must go to the cauconians
where i have a large sum of [[money]] long owing to me. as for telemachus,
now that he is your guest, send him to lacedaemon in a chariot, and
let one of your sons [[son]] go with him. be pleased also to provide him with
your [[best]] and fleetest horses." 

when she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and
all marvelled as they beheld it. nestor was astonished, and took telemachus
by the hand. "my friend," said he, "i see that you are going to be
a [[great]] hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you
are still so [[young]]. this can have been none other of those who dwell
in [[heaven]] than jove's redoubtable [[daughter]], the trito-born, who showed
such favour towards your brave [[father]] among the argives." "holy queen,"
he continued, "vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my good
wife, and my [[children]]. in return, i will offer you in [[sacrifice]] a
broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought
by [[man]] under the yoke. i will gild her horns, and will offer her up
to you in [[sacrifice]]." 

thus did he [[pray]], and minerva heard his prayer. he then [[led]] the way
to his own house, followed by his sons [[son]] and sons-in-law. when they
had got there and had taken their places on the benches and seats,
he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when
the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. as he mixed
the wine, he prayed much and made drink-offerings to minerva, daughter
of aegis-bearing jove. then, when they had made their drink-offerings
and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home
to bed each in his own abode; but nestor put telemachus to sleep in
the room that was over the gateway along with pisistratus, who was
the only unmarried [[son]] now left him. as for himself, he slept in an
inner room of the house, with the queen his [[wife]] by his side.

now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, nestor
left his couch and took his seat on the benches of [[white]] and polished
marble that stood in front of his house. here aforetime sat neleus,
peer of gods in counsel, but he was now [[dead]], and had gone to the
house of [[hades]]; so nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand, as guardian
of the [[public]] weal. his sons [[son]] as they left their rooms gathered round
him, echephron, stratius, perseus, aretus, and thrasymedes; the sixth
son was pisistratus, and when telemachus joined them they made him
sit with them. nestor then addressed them. 

"my sons [[son]]," said he, "make haste to do as i shall bid you. i [[wish]] first
and foremost to propitiate the [[great]] [[goddess]] minerva, who manifested
herself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities. go, then, one
or other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer,
and come on here with it at once. another must go to telemachus's
ship, and invite all the crew, leaving two [[men]] only in charge of the
vessel. some one else will run and fetch laerceus the goldsmith to
gild the horns of the heifer. the rest, stay all of you where you
are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and
to fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. tell them also-
to bring me some clear spring water." 

on this they hurried off on their several errands. the heifer was
brought in from the plain, and telemachus's crew came from the ship;
the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he
worked his gold, and minerva herself came to the [[sacrifice]]. nestor
gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that
the [[goddess]] might have [[pleasure]] in their [[beauty]]. then stratius and
echephron brought her in by the horns; aretus fetched water from the
house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other
hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy thrasymedes stood by
with a sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while perseus held a
bucket. then nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the
barley meal, and he offered many a prayer to minerva as he threw a
lock from the heifer's head upon the [[fire]]. 

when they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal thrasymedes
dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut
through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters
and daughters-in-law of nestor, and his venerable [[wife]] eurydice (she
was eldest [[daughter]] to clymenus) screamed with delight. then they
lifted the heifer's head from off the ground, and pisistratus cut
her throat. when she had done bleeding and was quite [[dead]], they cut
her up. they cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them
round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the
top of them; then nestor laid them upon the wood [[fire]] and poured wine
over them, while the [[young]] [[men]] stood near him with five-pronged spits
in their hands. when the thighs were burned and they had tasted the
inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces
on the spits and toasted them over the [[fire]]. 

meanwhile lovely polycaste, nestor's youngest [[daughter]], washed telemachus.
when she had washed him and anointed him with [[oil]], she brought him
a [[fair]] mantle and shirt, and he looked like a [[god]] as he came from
the bath and took his seat by the side of nestor. when the outer meats
were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where
they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them
out their wine in cups of gold. as soon as they had had had enough
to [[eat]] and drink nestor said, "sons, put telemachus's horses to the
chariot that he may start at once." 

thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the
fleet horses to the chariot. the housekeeper packed them up a provision
of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons [[son]] of princes [[prince]]. then telemachus
got into the chariot, while pisistratus gathered up the reins and
took his seat beside him. he lashed the horses on and they flew forward
nothing loth into the open [[country]], leaving the high citadel of pylos
behind them. all that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon their
necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the [[land]]. then
they reached pherae where diocles lived, who was [[son]] to ortilochus
and grandson to alpheus. here they passed the night and diocles entertained
them hospitably. when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn; appeared,
they again yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under
the echoing gatehouse. pisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew
forward nothing loth; presently they came to the corn lands [[land]] of the
open [[country]], and in the course of [[time]] completed their [[journey]], so
well did their steeds take them. 

now when the sun had set and darkness was over the [[land]],

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book iv

they reached the low lying [[city]] of lacedaemon them where they drove
straight to the of abode menelaus [and found him in his own house,
feasting with his many clansmen in [[honour]] of the wedding of his [[son]],
and also of his [[daughter]], whom he was marrying to the [[son]] of that
valiant warrior achilles. he had given his [[consent]] and promised her
to him while he was still at troy, and now the gods were bringing
the [[marriage]] about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses
to the [[city]] of the myrmidons over whom achilles' [[son]] was reigning.
for his only [[son]] he had found a bride from sparta, [[daughter]] of alector.
this [[son]], megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven
vouchsafed helen no more [[children]] after she had borne hermione, who
was [[fair]] as golden [[venus]] herself. 

so the neighbours and kinsmen of menelaus were feasting and making
merry in his house. there was a bard also to sing to them and play
his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of
them when the [[man]] struck up with his tune.] 

telemachus and the [[son]] of nestor stayed their horses at the gate,
whereon eteoneus servant to menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw
them ran hurrying back into the house to tell his master. he went
close up to him and said, "menelaus, there are some strangers come
here, two [[men]], who look like sons [[son]] of jove. what are we to do? shall
we take their horses out, or tell them to find [[friends]] elsewhere as
they [[best]] can?" 

menelaus was very angry and said, "eteoneus, [[son]] of boethous, you
never used to be a [[fool]], but now you talk like a simpleton. take their
horses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have
supper; you and i have stayed often enough at other people's houses
before we got back here, where [[heaven]] grant that we may rest in peace
henceforward." 

so eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. they
took their sweating hands from under the yoke, made them fast to the
mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. then they
leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led
the way into the house. telemachus and pisistratus were astonished
when they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon;
then, when they had admired everything to their heart's content, they
went into the bath room and washed themselves. 

when the servants had washed them and anointed them with [[oil]], they
brought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats
by the side of menelaus. a maidservant brought them water in a beautiful
golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their
hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. an upper servant brought
them bread, and offered them many [[good]] things of what there was in
the house, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats
and set cups of gold by their side. 

menelaus then greeted them saying, "fall to, and welcome; when you
have done supper i shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such
men as you cannot have been lost. you must be descended from a line
of sceptre-bearing kings [[king]], for [[poor]] [[people]] do not have such sons [[son]] as
you are." 

on this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set
near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good
things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat
and drink, telemachus said to the [[son]] of nestor, with his head so
close that no one might hear, "look, pisistratus, [[man]] after my own
heart, see the gleam of bronze and gold- of amber, ivory, and silver.
everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of olympian
jove. i am lost in admiration." 

menelaus overheard him and said, "no one, my sons [[son]], can hold his own
with jove, for his house and everything about him is [[immortal]]; but
among mortal men- well, there may be another who has as much wealth
as i have, or there may not; but at all events i have travelled much
and have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before
i could get [[home]] with my fleet. i went to cyprus, phoenicia and the
egyptians; i went also to the ethiopians, the sidonians, and the erembians,
and to libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born,
and the sheep lamb down three times [[time]] a year. every one in that [[country]],
whether master or [[man]], has plenty of cheese, meat, and [[good]] milk,
for the ewes yield all the year round. but while i was travelling
and getting [[great]] riches [[rich]] among these [[people]], my [[brother]] was secretly
and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked [[wife]], so
that i have no [[pleasure]] in being [[lord]] of all this [[wealth]]. whoever
your parents may be they must have told you about all this, and of
my heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully and magnificently
furnished. would that i had only a third of what i now have so that
i had stayed at [[home]], and all those were living who perished on the
plain of troy, far from argos. i of grieve, as i sit here in my house,
for one and all of them. at times [[time]] i cry aloud for [[sorrow]], but presently
i leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of
it. yet grieve for these as i may, i do so for one [[man]] more than for
them all. i cannot even [[think]] of him without loathing both food and
sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one of all the achaeans
worked so hard or risked so much as he did. he took nothing by it,
and has left a legacy of [[sorrow]] to myself, for he has been gone a
long [[time]], and we [[know]] not whether he is alive or [[dead]]. his old [[father]],
his long-suffering [[wife]] penelope, and his [[son]] telemachus, whom he
left behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in [[grief]] on his account."

thus spoke menelaus, and the [[heart]] of telemachus yearned as he bethought
him of his [[father]]. tears fell from his [[eyes]] as he heard him thus mentioned,
so that he held his cloak before his face with both hands. when menelaus
saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own [[time]] for speaking,
or to ask him at once and find what it was all about. 

while he was thus in two minds [[mind]] helen came down from her high vaulted
and perfumed room, looking as lovely as diana herself. adraste brought
her a seat, alcippe a soft woollen rug while phylo fetched her the
silver work-box which alcandra [[wife]] of polybus had given her. polybus
lived in egyptian thebes, which is the richest [[city]] in the whole [[world]];
he gave menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and
ten [[talents]] of gold; besides all this, his [[wife]] gave helen some beautiful
presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work-box that ran
on wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. phylo now placed
this by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with
violet coloured wool was laid upon the top of it. then helen took
her seat, put her feet upon the footstool, and began to [[question]] her
husband. 

"do we [[know]], menelaus," said she, "the names of these strangers who
have come to visit us? shall i guess [[right]] or [[wrong]]?-but i cannot
help saying what i [[think]]. never yet have i seen either [[man]] or woman
so like somebody else (indeed when i look at him i hardly [[know]] what
to think) as this [[young]] [[man]] is like telemachus, whom [[ulysses]] left
as a baby behind him, when you achaeans went to troy with [[battle]] in
your hearts [[heart]], on account of my most shameless [[self]]." 

"my dear [[wife]]," replied menelaus, "i see the likeness just as you
do. his hands and feet are just like ulysses'; so is his hair, with
the shape of his head and the expression of his [[eyes]]. moreover, when
i was talking about [[ulysses]], and saying how much he had [[suffered]] on
my account, tears fell from his [[eyes]], and he hid his face in his mantle."

then pisistratus said, "menelaus, [[son]] of atreus, you are [[right]] in
thinking that this [[young]] [[man]] is telemachus, but he is very modest,
and is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one
whose conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. my [[father]],
nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to [[know]] whether
you could give him any counsel or suggestion. a [[son]] has always trouble
at [[home]] when his [[father]] has gone away leaving him without supporters;
and this is how telemachus is now placed, for his [[father]] is absent,
and there is no one among his own [[people]] to stand by him."

"bless my [[heart]]," replied menelaus, "then i am receiving a visit from
the [[son]] of a very dear friend, who [[suffered]] much hardship for my sake.
i had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when
heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. i should
have founded a [[city]] for him in argos, and built him a house. i should
have made him leave ithaca with his goods [[good]], his [[son]], and all his [[people]],
and should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities
that are [[subject]] to me. we should thus have seen one another continually,
and nothing but [[death]] could have interrupted so close and [[happy]] an
intercourse. i suppose, however, that [[heaven]] grudged us such great
good [[fortune]], for it has prevented the [[poor]] fellow from ever getting
home at all." 

thus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. helen wept,
telemachus wept, and so did menelaus, nor could pisistratus keep his
eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear [[brother]] antilochus
whom the [[son]] of bright dawn had killed. thereon he said to menelaus,

"sir, my [[father]] nestor, when we used to talk about you at [[home]], told
me you were a [[person]] of rare and excellent understanding. if, then,
it be possible, do as i would urge you. i am not fond of crying while
i am getting my supper. morning will come in due course, and in the
forenoon i [[care]] not how much i cry for those that are [[dead]] and gone.
this is all we can do for the [[poor]] things. we can only shave our heads
for them and wring the tears from our cheeks. i had a [[brother]] who
died at troy; he was by no means the worst [[man]] there; you are sure
to have known him- his name was antilochus; i never set [[eyes]] upon
him myself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and
in [[fight]] valiant." 

"your discretion, my friend," answered menelaus, "is beyond your years.
it is plain you take after your [[father]]. one can soon see when a man
is [[son]] to one whom [[heaven]] has blessed both as regards [[wife]] and offspring-
and it has blessed nestor from first to [[last]] all his days, giving
him a green old [[age]] in his own house, with sons [[son]] about him who are
both we disposed and valiant. we will put an end therefore to all
this weeping, and attend to our supper again. let water be poured
over our hands. telemachus and i can talk with one another fully in
the morning." 

on this asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands
and they laid their hands on the [[good]] things that were before them.

then jove's [[daughter]] helen bethought her of another matter. she drugged
the wine with an herb that banishes all [[care]], [[sorrow]], and ill [[humour]].
whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a [[single]] tear all the
rest of the day, not even though his [[father]] and [[mother]] both of them
drop down [[dead]], or he sees a [[brother]] or a [[son]] hewn in pieces before
his very [[eyes]]. this drug, of such [[sovereign]] [[power]] and [[virtue]], had
been given to helen by polydamna [[wife]] of thon, a woman of [[egypt]], where
there grow all sorts of herbs, some [[good]] to put into the mixing-bowl
and others poisonous. moreover, every one in the whole [[country]] is
a skilled physician, for they are of the [[race]] of paeeon. when helen
had put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve
the wine round, she said: 

"menelaus, [[son]] of atreus, and you my [[good]] [[friends]], sons [[son]] of honourable
men (which is as jove wills, for he is the giver both of [[good]] and
evil, and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen
while i tell you a tale in season. i cannot indeed name every single
one of the exploits of [[ulysses]], but i can say what he did when he
was before troy, and you achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties.
he covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in
rags, and entered the enemy's [[city]] looking like a menial or a beggar.
and quite different from what he did when he was among his own [[people]].
in this [[disguise]] he entered the [[city]] of troy, and no one said anything
to him. i alone recognized him and began to [[question]] him, but he was
too cunning for me. when, however, i had washed and anointed him and
had given him clothes, and after i had sworn a solemn oath not to
betray him to the trojans till he had got safely back to his own camp
and to the ships, he told me all that the achaeans meant to do. he
killed many trojans and got much information before he reached the
argive camp, for all which things the trojan [[women]] made lamentation,
but for my own part i was glad, for my [[heart]] was beginning to oam
after my [[home]], and i was unhappy about [[wrong]] that [[venus]] had done me
in taking me over there, away from my [[country]], my girl, and my lawful
wedded husband, who is indeed by no means deficient either in person
or understanding." 

then menelaus said, "all that you have been saying, my dear [[wife]],
is true. i have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes,
but i have never seen such another [[man]] as [[ulysses]]. what endurance
too, and what [[courage]] he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein
all the bravest of the argives were lying in wait to bring [[death]] and
destruction upon the trojans. at that moment you came up to us; some
god who wished well to the trojans must have set you on to it and
you had deiphobus with you. three times [[time]] did you go all round our hiding
place and pat it; you called our chiefs [[chief]] each by his own name, and
mimicked all our wives [[wife]] -diomed, [[ulysses]], and i from our seats inside
heard what a noise you made. diomed and i could not make up our minds
whether to spring out then and there, or to [[answer]] you from inside,
but [[ulysses]] held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except
anticlus, who was beginning to [[answer]] you, when [[ulysses]] clapped his
two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. it was this
that saved us all, for he muzzled anticlus till minerva took you away
again." 

"how [[sad]]," exclaimed telemachus, "that all this was of no avail to
save him, nor yet his own iron [[courage]]. but now, sir, be pleased to
send us all to bed, that we may [[lie]] down and enjoy the blessed boon
of sleep." 

on this helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that
was in the gatehouse, and to make them with [[good]] red rugs, and spread
coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to
wear. so the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds,
to which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. thus, then,
did telemachus and pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while
the [[son]] of atreus lay in an inner room with lovely helen by his side.

when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, menelaus
rose and dressed himself. he bound his sandals on to his comely feet,
girded his [[sword]] about his shoulders, and left his room looking like
an [[immortal]] [[god]]. then, taking a seat near telemachus he said:

"and what, telemachus, has [[led]] you to take this long sea [[voyage]] to
lacedaemon? are you on [[public]] or private [[business]]? tell me all about
it." 

"i have come, sir replied telemachus, "to see if you can tell me anything
about my [[father]]. i am being eaten out of house and [[home]]; my [[fair]] estate
is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing
great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying their
addresses to my [[mother]]. therefore, i am suppliant at your knees if
haply you may tell me about my father's melancholy end, whether you
saw it with your own [[eyes]], or heard it from some other traveller;
for he was a [[man]] born to trouble. do not soften things out of any
pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw.
if my brave [[father]] [[ulysses]] ever did you [[loyal]] service either by word
or deed, when you achaeans were harassed by the trojans, bear it in
mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all." 

menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. "so," he exclaimed,
"these cowards would usurp a brave man's [[man]] bed? a hind might as well
lay her new born [[young]] in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed
in the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back
to his lair will make short [[work]] with the pair of them- and so will
ulysses with these suitors. by [[father]] jove, minerva, and [[apollo]], if
ulysses is still the [[man]] that he was when he wrestled with philomeleides
in lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the achaeans cheered
him- if he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they
would have a short shrift and a [[sorry]] wedding. as regards your questions [[question]],
however, i will not prevaricate nor [[deceive]] you, but will tell you
without concealment all that the old [[man]] of the sea told me.

"i was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in [[egypt]],
for my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods
are very strict about having their dues. now off [[egypt]], about as far
as a ship can sail in a day with a [[good]] stiff breeze behind her, there
is an island called pharos- it has a [[good]] harbour from which vessels
can get out into open sea when they have taken in water- and the gods
becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of [[fair]] wind to
help me forward. we should have run clean out of provisions and my
men would have starved, if a [[goddess]] had not taken [[pity]] upon me and
saved me in the [[person]] of idothea, [[daughter]] to proteus, the old man
of the sea, for she had taken a [[great]] fancy to me. 

"she came to me one day when i was by myself, as i often was, for
the [[men]] used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in
the [[hope]] of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of
hunger. 'stranger,' said she, 'it seems to me that you like starving
in this way- at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you
stick here day after day, without even trying to get away though your
men are dying by inches.' 

"'let me tell you,' said i, 'whichever of the goddesses [[goddess]] you may happen
to be, that i am not staying here of my own accord, but must have
offended the gods that [[live]] in [[heaven]]. tell me, therefore, for the
gods [[know]] everything. which of the immortals [[immortal]] it is that is hindering
me in this way, and tell me also how i may sail the sea so as to reach
my [[home]].' 

"'stranger,' replied she, 'i will make it all quite clear to you.
there is an old [[immortal]] who lives [[life]] under the sea hereabouts and whose
name is proteus. he is an egyptian, and [[people]] say he is my [[father]];
he is neptune's head [[man]] and knows [[know]] every inch of ground all over the
bottom of the sea. if you can snare him and hold him tight, he will
tell you about your [[voyage]], what courses you are to take, and how
you are to sail the sea so as to reach your [[home]]. he will also tell
you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house both
good and [[bad]], while you have been away on your long and dangerous
journey.' 

"'can you show me,' said i, 'some stratagem by means of which i may
catch this old [[god]] without his suspecting it and finding me out? for
a [[god]] is not easily caught- not by a mortal [[man]].' 

"'stranger,' said she, 'i will make it all quite clear to you. about
the [[time]] when the sun shall have reached mid [[heaven]], the old [[man]] of
the sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the west wind that
furs the water over his head. as soon as he has come up he lies [[lie]] down,
and goes to sleep in a [[great]] sea cave, where the seals- halosydne's
chickens as they call them- come up also from the grey sea, and go
to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very [[strong]] and fish-like
smell do they bring with them. early to-morrow morning i will take
you to this place and will lay you in ambush. pick out, therefore,
the three [[best]] [[men]] you have in your fleet, and i will tell you all
the tricks that the old [[man]] will play you. 

"'first he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when
he has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go
to sleep among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. the moment you
see that he is asleep seize him; put forth all your [[strength]] and hold
him fast, for he will do his very utmost to get away from you. he
will turn himself into every [[kind]] of creature that goes upon the [[earth]],
and will become also both [[fire]] and water; but you must hold him fast
and grip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and
comes back to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may
slacken your hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the
gods it is that is angry with you, and what you must do to reach your
home over the seas.' 

"having so said she dived under the waves, whereon i turned back to
the place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart
was clouded with [[care]] as i went along. when i reached my ship we got
supper ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.

"when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, i took the
three [[men]] on whose prowess of all kinds [[kind]] i could most rely, and went
along by the sea-side, praying heartily to [[heaven]]. meanwhile the goddess
fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them
just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her [[father]]. then
she dug four pits for us to [[lie]] in, and sat down to wait till we should
come up. when we were close to her, she made us [[lie]] down in the pits
one after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. our ambuscade
would have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was
most distressing- who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could
help it?-but here, too, the [[goddess]] helped us, and [[thought]] of something
that gave us [[great]] relief, for she put some ambrosia under each man's
nostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals.

"we waited the whole morning and made the [[best]] of it, watching the
seals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon
the old [[man]] of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat
seals he went over them and counted them. we were among the first
he counted, and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down
to sleep as soon as he had done counting. then we rushed upon him
with a shout and seized him; on which he began at once with his old
tricks, and changed himself first into a lion with a [[great]] mane; then
all of a sudden he became a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next
moment he was running water, and then again directly he was a tree,
but we stuck to him and never lost hold, till at [[last]] the cunning
old creature became distressed, and said, which of the gods was it,
son of atreus, that hatched this plot with you for snaring me and
seizing me against my will? what do you want?' 

"'you [[know]] that yourself, old [[man]],' i answered, 'you will gain nothing
by trying to put me off. it is because i have been kept so long in
this island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. i am losing
all [[heart]]; tell me, then, for you gods [[know]] everything, which of the
immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how i may sail
the sea so as to reach my [[home]]?' 

"then,' he said, 'if you would finish your [[voyage]] and get [[home]] quickly,
you must offer sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to jove and to the rest of the gods before
embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your [[friends]],
and to your own house, till you have returned to the [[heaven]] fed stream
of [[egypt]], and offered holy hecatombs to the [[immortal]] gods that reign
in [[heaven]]. when you have done this they will let you finish your [[voyage]].'

"i was broken hearted when i heard that i must go back all that long
and terrible [[voyage]] to [[egypt]]; nevertheless, i answered, 'i will do
all, old [[man]], that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell
me true, whether all the achaeans whom nestor and i left behind us
when we set sail from troy have got [[home]] safely, or whether any one
of them came to a [[bad]] end either on board his own ship or among his
friends when the days of his fighting were done.' 

"'son of atreus,' he answered, 'why ask me? you had [[better]] not know
what i can tell you, for your [[eyes]] will surely fill when you have
heard my story. many of those about whom you ask are [[dead]] and gone,
but many still remain, and only two of the [[chief]] [[men]] among the achaeans
perished during their return [[home]]. as for what happened on the field
of battle- you were there yourself. a third achaean leader is still
at sea, alive, but hindered from returning. ajax was wrecked, for
neptune drove him on to the [[great]] rocks of gyrae; nevertheless, he
let him get safe out of the water, and in spite of all minerva's hatred
he would have escaped [[death]], if he had not ruined himself by boasting.
he said the gods could not drown him even though they had tried to
do so, and when [[neptune]] heard this large talk, he seized his trident
in his two brawny hands, and split the rock of gyrae in two pieces.
the base remained where it was, but the part on which ajax was sitting
fell headlong into the sea and carried ajax with it; so he drank salt
water and was drowned. 

"'your [[brother]] and his ships escaped, for juno protected him, but
when he was just about to reach the high promontory of malea, he was
caught by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against
his will, and drove him to the foreland where thyestes used to dwell,
but where aegisthus was then living. by and by, however, it seemed
as though he was to return safely after all, for the gods backed the
wind into its old quarter and they reached [[home]]; whereon agamemnon
kissed his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in
his own [[country]]. 

"'now there was a watchman whom aegisthus kept always on the watch,
and to whom he had promised two [[talents]] of gold. this [[man]] had been
looking out for a whole year to make sure that [[agamemnon]] did not give
him the slip and prepare [[war]]; when, therefore, this [[man]] saw agamemnon
go by, he went and told aegisthus who at once began to lay a plot
for him. he picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them
in ambuscade on one side the cloister, while on the opposite side
he prepared a banquet. then he sent his chariots and horsemen to [[agamemnon]],
and invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. he got him there,
all unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him
when the banquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the
shambles; not one of agamemnon's followers was left alive, nor yet
one of aegisthus', but they were all killed there in the cloisters.'

"thus spoke proteus, and i was broken hearted as i heard him. i sat
down upon the sands and wept; i [[felt]] as though i could no longer bear
to [[live]] nor look upon the [[light]] of the sun. presently, when i had
had my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old [[man]] of
the sea said, 'son of atreus, do not waste any more [[time]] in crying
so bitterly; it can do no manner of [[good]]; find your way [[home]] as fast
as ever you can, for aegisthus be still alive, and even though orestes
has beforehand with you in kilting him, you may yet come in for his
funeral.' 

"on this i took comfort in spite of all my [[sorrow]], and said, 'i [[know]],
then, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third [[man]] of
whom you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get [[home]]?
or is he [[dead]]? tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.'

"'the third [[man]],' he answered, 'is [[ulysses]] who dwells in ithaca. i
can see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph
calypso, who is keeping him [[prisoner]], and he cannot reach his home
for he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. as for your
own end, menelaus, you shall not [[die]] in argos, but the gods will take
you to the elysian plain, which is at the ends of the [[world]]. there
fair-haired rhadamanthus reigns, and [[men]] lead an easier [[life]] than
any where else in the [[world]], for in elysium there falls not rain,
nor hail, nor snow, but oceanus breathes ever with a west wind that
sings softly from the sea, and gives fresh [[life]] to all [[men]]. this will
happen to you because you have [[married]] helen, and are jove's son-in-law.'

"as he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon i turned back to the
ships with my companions, and my [[heart]] was clouded with [[care]] as i
went along. when we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night
was falling, and camped down upon the beach. when the child of morning,
rosy-fingered dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and
put our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves,
took our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars.
i again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of [[egypt]], and
offered hecatombs that were full and sufficient. when i had thus appeased
heaven's anger, i raised a barrow to the memory of [[agamemnon]] that
his name might [[live]] for ever, after which i had a quick passage [[home]],
for the gods sent me a [[fair]] wind. 

"and now for yourself- stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and
i will then speed you on your way. i will make you a [[noble]] present
of a chariot and three horses. i will also give you a beautiful chalice
that so long as you [[live]] you may [[think]] of me whenever you make a drink-offering
to the [[immortal]] gods." 

"son of atreus," replied telemachus, "do not press me to stay longer;
i should be contented to remain with you for another twelve months;
i find your conversation so delightful that i should never once wish
myself at [[home]] with my parents; but my crew whom i have left at pylos
are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. as for
any [[present]] you may be disposed to make me, i had rather that it should
he a piece of plate. i will take no horses back with me to ithaca,
but will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have much flat
ground in your [[kingdom]] where lotus thrives, as also meadowsweet and
wheat and barley, and oats with their [[white]] and spreading ears; whereas
in ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country
is more fit for goats than horses, and i like it the [[better]] for that.
none of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and
ithaca least of all." 

menelaus smiled and took telemachus's hand within his own. "what you
say," said he, "shows that you come of [[good]] [[family]]. i both can, and
will, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most
precious piece of plate in all my house. it is a mixing-bowl by vulcan's
own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold.
phaedimus, [[king]] of the sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit
which i paid him when i returned thither on my homeward [[journey]]. i
will make you a [[present]] of it." 

thus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king's house.
they brought sheep and wine, while their wives [[wife]] had put up bread for
them to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in
the courts]. 

meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at
a mark on the levelled ground in front of ulysses' house, and were
behaving with all their old insolence. antinous and eurymachus, who
were their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were
sitting together when noemon [[son]] of phronius came up and said to antinous,

"have we any [[idea]], antinous, on what day telemachus returns from pylos?
he has a ship of mine, and i want it, to cross over to elis: i have
twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not
yet broken in, and i want to bring one of them over here and break
him." 

they were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that
telemachus had not gone to the [[city]] of neleus. they [[thought]] he was
only away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with
the swineherd; so antinous said, "when did he go? tell me truly, and
what [[young]] [[men]] did he take with him? were they freemen or his own
bondsmen- for he might manage that too? tell me also, did you let
him have the ship of your own [[free]] will because he [[asked]] you, or did
he take it without yourleave?" 

"i lent it him," answered noemon, "what else could i do when a man
of his position said he was in a difficulty, and [[asked]] me to oblige
him? i could not possibly refuse. as for those who went with him they
were the [[best]] [[young]] [[men]] we have, and i saw mentor go on board as captain-
or some [[god]] who was exactly like him. i cannot [[understand]] it, for
i saw mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting
out for pylos." 

noemon then went back to his father's house, but antinous and eurymachus
were very angry. they told the others to leave off playing, and to
come and sit down along with themselves. when they came, antinous
son of eupeithes spoke in anger. his [[heart]] was black with rage, and
his [[eyes]] flashed [[fire]] as he said: 

"good heavens [[heaven]], this [[voyage]] of telemachus is a very serious matter;
we had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the [[young]] fellow
has got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. he will be
giving us trouble presently; may jove take him before he is full grown.
find me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty [[men]], and i will lie
in wait for him in the straits between ithaca and samos; he will then
rue the day that he set out to try and get news of his [[father]]."

thus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then
all of them went inside the buildings. 

it was not long ere penelope came to [[know]] what the suitors were plotting;
for a [[man]] servant, medon, overheard them from outside the outer court
as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell his mistress.
as he crossed the threshold of her room penelope said: "medon, what
have the suitors sent you here for? is it to tell the maids to leave
their master's [[business]] and cook dinner for them? i [[wish]] they may
neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else,
but let this be the very [[last]] [[time]], for the waste you all make of
my son's estate. did not your fathers [[father]] tell you when you were children
how [[good]] [[ulysses]] had been to them- never doing anything high-handed,
nor speaking harshly to anybody? kings [[king]] may say things sometimes, and
they may take a fancy to one [[man]] and dislike another, but ulysses
never did an [[unjust]] thing by anybody- which shows what [[bad]] hearts
you have, and that there is no such thing as gratitude left in this
world." 

then medon said, "i [[wish]], madam, that this were all; but they are
plotting something much more dreadful now- may [[heaven]] frustrate their
design. they are going to try and murder telemachus as he is coming
home from pylos and lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his
father." 

then penelope's [[heart]] sank within her, and for a long [[time]] she was
speechless; her [[eyes]] filled with tears, and she could find no utterance.
at [[last]], however, she said, "why did my [[son]] leave me? what business
had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the
ocean like sea-horses? does he want to [[die]] without leaving any one
behind him to keep up his name?" 

"i do not [[know]]," answered medon, "whether some [[god]] set him on to it,
or whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out
if his [[father]] was [[dead]], or alive and on his way [[home]]." 

then he went downstairs again, leaving penelope in an agony of [[grief]].
there were plenty of seats in the house, but she. had no [[heart]] for
sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor
of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both
old and [[young]], gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last
in a transport of [[sorrow]] she exclaimed, 

"my dears, [[heaven]] has been pleased to try me with more affliction
than any other woman of my [[age]] and [[country]]. first i lost my brave
and lion-hearted husband, who had every [[good]] quality under [[heaven]],
and whose name was [[great]] over all hellas and middle argos, and now
my darling [[son]] is at the [[mercy]] of the winds and waves, without my
having heard one word about his leaving [[home]]. you hussies, there was
not one of you would so much as [[think]] of giving me a call out of my
bed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. if
i had known he meant taking this [[voyage]], he would have had to give
it up, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse
behind him- one or other. now, however, go some of you and call old
dolius, who was given me by my [[father]] on my [[marriage]], and who is my
gardener. bid him go at once and tell everything to laertes, who may
be able to hit on some plan for enlisting [[public]] sympathy on our side,
as against those who are trying to exterminate his own [[race]] and that
of [[ulysses]]." 

then the dear old nurse euryclea said, "you may kill me, madam, or
let me [[live]] on in your house, whichever you please, but i will tell
you the real [[truth]]. i knew all about it, and gave him everything he
wanted in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn
oath that i would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days,
unless you [[asked]] or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did
not want you to spoil your [[beauty]] by crying. and now, madam, wash
your face, [[change]] your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer
prayers to minerva, [[daughter]] of aegis-bearing jove, for she can save
him even though he be in the jaws of [[death]]. do not trouble laertes:
he has trouble enough already. besides, i cannot [[think]] that the gods
hate [[die]] [[race]] of the [[race]] of the [[son]] of arceisius so much, but there
will be a [[son]] left to come up after him, and inherit both the house
and the [[fair]] fields that [[lie]] far all round it." 

with these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried
the tears from her [[eyes]]. penelope washed her face, changed her dress,
and went upstairs with her maids. she then put some bruised barley
into a basket and began praying to minerva. 

"hear me," she cried, "daughter of aegis-bearing jove, unweariable.
if ever [[ulysses]] while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep
or heifer, bear it in [[mind]] now as in my favour, and save my darling
son from the villainy of the suitors." 

she cried aloud as she spoke, and the [[goddess]] heard her prayer; meanwhile
the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister, and one
of them said: 

"the queen is preparing for her [[marriage]] with one or other of us.
little does she [[dream]] that her [[son]] has now been doomed to [[die]]."

this was what they said, but they did not [[know]] what was going to happen.
then antinous said, "comrades, let there be no loud talking, lest
some of it get carried inside. let us be up and do that in [[silence]],
about which we are all of a [[mind]]." 

he then chose twenty [[men]], and they went down to their. ship and to
the sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast
and sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted
thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the [[white]] sails aloft,
while their fine servants brought them their armour. then they made
the ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers,
and waited till night should fall. 

but penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to [[eat]] or drink,
and wondering whether her brave [[son]] would escape, or be overpowered
by the wicked suitors. like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen
hemming her in on every side she [[thought]] and [[thought]] till she sank
into a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of [[thought]] and motion.

then minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in
the likeness of penelope's sister iphthime [[daughter]] of icarius who
had [[married]] eumelus and lived in pherae. she told the vision to go
to the house of [[ulysses]], and to make penelope leave off crying, so
it came into her room by the hole through which the thong went for
pulling the door to, and hovered over her head, saying, 

"you are asleep, penelope: the gods who [[live]] at ease will not suffer
you to weep and be so [[sad]]. your [[son]] has done them no [[wrong]], so he
will yet come back to you." 

penelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,
"sister, why have you come here? you do not come very often, but i
suppose that is because you [[live]] such a long way off. am i, then,
to leave off crying and refrain from all the [[sad]] thoughts [[thought]] that torture
me? i, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every
good quality under [[heaven]], and whose name was [[great]] over all hellas
and middle argos; and now my darling [[son]] has gone off on board of
a ship- a foolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor
to going about among gatherings of [[men]]. i am even more anxious about
him than about my husband; i am all in a tremble when i [[think]] of him,
lest something should happen to him, either from the [[people]] among
whom he has gone, or by sea, for he has many enemies [[enemy]] who are plotting
against him, and are bent on killing him before he can return [[home]]."

then the vision said, "take [[heart]], and be not so much dismayed. there
is one gone with him whom many a [[man]] would be glad enough to have
stand by his side, i mean minerva; it is she who has compassion upon
you, and who has sent me to bear you this message." 

"then," said penelope, "if you are a [[god]] or have been sent here by
divine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one- is he
still alive, or is he already [[dead]] and in the house of [[hades]]?"

and the vision said, "i shall not tell you for [[certain]] whether he
is alive or [[dead]], and there is no use in idle conversation."

then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated
into thin air; but penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted,
so vivid had been her [[dream]]. 

meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the
sea, intent on murdering telemachus. now there is a rocky islet called
asteris, of no [[great]] size, in mid channel between ithaca and samos,
and there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can [[lie]].
here then the achaeans placed themselves in ambush. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book v

and now, as dawn rose from her couch beside tithonus- harbinger of
light alike to mortals and immortals- the gods met in council and
with them, jove the [[lord]] of thunder, who is their [[king]]. thereon minerva
began to tell them of the many sufferings of [[ulysses]], for she pitied
him away there in the house of the [[nymph]] calypso. 

"father jove," said she, "and all you other gods that [[live]] in everlasting
bliss, i [[hope]] there may never be such a thing as a [[kind]] and well-disposed
ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. i [[hope]] they will
be all henceforth cruel and [[unjust]], for there is not one of his subjects
but has forgotten [[ulysses]], who ruled them as though he were their
father. there he is, lying in [[great]] [[pain]] in an island where dwells
the [[nymph]] calypso, who will not let him go; and he cannot get back
to his own [[country]], for he can find neither ships nor sailors to take
him over the sea. furthermore, wicked [[people]] are now trying to murder
his only [[son]] telemachus, who is coming [[home]] from pylos and lacedaemon,
where he has been to see if he can get news of his [[father]]."

"what, my dear, are you talking about?" replied her [[father]], "did you
not send him there yourself, because you [[thought]] it would [[help]] ulysses
to get [[home]] and punish the suitors? besides, you are perfectly able
to [[protect]] telemachus, and to see him safely [[home]] again, while the
suitors have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him."

when he had thus spoken, he said to his [[son]] mercury, "mercury, you
are our messenger, go therefore and tell calypso we have decreed that
poor [[ulysses]] is to return [[home]]. he is to be convoyed neither by gods
nor [[men]], but after a perilous [[voyage]] of twenty days upon a raft he
is to reach fertile scheria, the [[land]] of the phaeacians, who are near
of kin to the gods, and will [[honour]] him as though he were one of ourselves.
they will send him in a ship to his own [[country]], and will give him
more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back from
troy, if he had had had all his prize [[money]] and had got [[home]] without
disaster. this is how we have settled that he shall return to his
country and his [[friends]]." 

thus he spoke, and mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of argus, did
as he was told. forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals
with which he could fly like the wind over [[land]] and sea. he took the
wand with which he seals men's [[eyes]] in sleep or wakes them just as
he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over pieria; then he swooped
down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose
waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and
corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray.
he flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at [[last]] he got to
the island which was his journey's end, he left the sea and went on
by [[land]] till he came to the cave where the [[nymph]] calypso lived.

he found her at [[home]]. there was a large [[fire]] burning on the hearth,
and one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and
sandal wood. as for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her
golden shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. round her
cave there was a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress
trees, wherein all kinds [[kind]] of [[great]] birds had built their nests- owls,
hawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupy their [[business]] in the
waters. a vine loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly
about the mouth of the cave; there were also four running rills of
water in channels cut pretty close together, and turned hither and
thither so as to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious herbage
over which they flowed. even a [[god]] could not [[help]] being charmed with
such a lovely spot, so mercury stood still and looked at it; but when
he had admired it sufficiently he went inside the cave. 

calypso knew him at once- for the gods all [[know]] each other, no matter
how far they [[live]] from one another- but [[ulysses]] was not within; he
was on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with
tears in his [[eyes]], groaning and breaking his [[heart]] for [[sorrow]]. calypso
gave mercury a seat and said: "why have you come to see me, mercury-
honoured, and ever welcome- for you do not visit me often? say what
you want; i will do it for be you at once if i can, and if it can
be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before
you. 

as she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and
mixed him some red nectar, so mercury ate and drank till he had had
enough, and then said: 

"we are speaking [[god]] and [[goddess]] to one another, one another, and
you ask me why i have come here, and i will tell you truly as you
would have me do. jove sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could
possibly want to come all this way over the sea where there are no
cities full of [[people]] to offer me sacrifices [[sacrifice]] or [[choice]] hecatombs?
nevertheless i had to come, for none of us other gods can cross jove,
nor transgress his orders. he says that you have here the most ill-starred
of alf those who fought nine years before the [[city]] of [[king]] priam and
sailed [[home]] in the tenth year after having sacked it. on their way
home they sinned against minerva, who raised both wind and waves against
them, so that all his brave companions perished, and he alone was
carried hither by wind and tide. jove says that you are to let this
by [[man]] go at once, for it is decreed that he shall not perish here,
far from his own [[people]], but shall return to his house and country
and see his [[friends]] again." 

calypso trembled with rage when she heard this, "you gods," she exclaimed,
to be ashamed of yourselves. you are always [[jealous]] and hate seeing
a [[goddess]] take a fancy to a mortal [[man]], and [[live]] with him in open
matrimony. so when rosy-fingered dawn made [[love]] to orion, you precious
gods were all of you furious till diana went and killed him in ortygia.
so again when ceres fell in [[love]] with iasion, and yielded to him in
a thrice ploughed fallow field, jove came to hear of it before so
long and killed iasion with his thunder-bolts. and now you are angry
with me too because i have a [[man]] here. i found the [[poor]] creature sitting
all alone astride of a keel, for jove had struck his ship with lightning
and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while
he himself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. i got fond
of him and cherished him, and had set my [[heart]] on making him [[immortal]],
so that he should never grow old all his days; still i cannot cross
jove, nor bring his counsels to nothing; therefore, if he insists
upon it, let the [[man]] go beyond the seas again; but i cannot send him
anywhere myself for i have neither ships nor [[men]] who can take him.
nevertheless i will readily give him such [[advice]], in all [[good]] [[faith]],
as will be likely to bring him safely to his own [[country]]."

"then send him away," said mercury, "or jove will be angry with you
and punish you"' 

on this he took his leave, and calypso went out to look for [[ulysses]],
for she had heard jove's message. she found him sitting upon the beach
with his [[eyes]] ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home-sickness;
for he had got tired of calypso, and though he was forced to sleep
with her in the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have
it so. as for the day [[time]], he spent it on the rocks and on the sea-shore,
weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon
the sea. calypso then went close up to him said: 

"my [[poor]] fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your
life out any longer. i am going to send you away of my own [[free]] will;
so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with
an upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. i will put
bread, wine, and water on board to save you from starving. i will
also give you clothes, and will send you a [[fair]] wind to take you [[home]],
if the gods in [[heaven]] so will it- for they [[know]] more about these things,
and can settle them [[better]] than i can." 

ulysses shuddered as he heard her. "now [[goddess]]," he answered, "there
is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help
me [[home]] when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on
a raft. not even a well-found ship with a [[fair]] wind could venture
on such a distant [[voyage]]: nothing that you can say or do shall mage
me go on board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean
me no mischief." 

calypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: "you [[know]] a
great deal," said she, "but you are quite [[wrong]] here. may [[heaven]] above
and [[earth]] below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river styx-
and this is the most solemn oath which a blessed [[god]] can take- that
i mean you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly
what i should do myself in your place. i am dealing with you quite
straightforwardly; my [[heart]] is not made of iron, and i am very sorry
for you." 

when she had thus spoken she [[led]] the way rapidly before him, and ulysses
followed in her steps; so the pair, [[goddess]] and [[man]], went on and on
till they came to calypso's cave, where [[ulysses]] took the seat that
mercury had just left. calypso set meat and drink before him of the
food that mortals [[eat]]; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar for
herself, and they laid their hands on the [[good]] things that were before
them. when they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink, calypso
spoke, saying: 

"ulysses, [[noble]] [[son]] of laertes, so you would start [[home]] to your own
land at once? [[good]] [[luck]] go with you, but if you could only [[know]] how
much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own
country, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and
let me make you [[immortal]], no matter how anxious you may be to see
this [[wife]] of yours, of whom you are thinking all the [[time]] day after
day; yet i flatter myself that at am no whit less tall or well-looking
than she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should
compare in [[beauty]] with an [[immortal]]." 

"goddess," replied [[ulysses]], "do not be angry with me about this. i
am quite aware that my [[wife]] penelope is nothing like so tall or so
beautiful as yourself. she is only a woman, whereas you are an [[immortal]].
nevertheless, i want to get [[home]], and can [[think]] of nothing else. if
some [[god]] wrecks me when i am on the sea, i will bear it and make the
best of it. i have had infinite trouble both by [[land]] and sea already,
so let this go with the rest." 

presently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired
into the inner part of the cave and went to bed. 

when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, [[ulysses]] put
on his shirt and cloak, while the [[goddess]] wore a dress of a light
gossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle
about her waist and a veil to cover her head. she at once set herself
to [[think]] how she could speed [[ulysses]] on his way. so she gave him a
great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides,
and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. she
also gave him a sharp adze, and then [[led]] the way to the far end of
the island where the largest trees grew- alder, poplar and pine, that
reached the sky- very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail [[light]] for
him in the water. then, when she had shown him where the [[best]] trees
grew, calypso went [[home]], leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished
doing. he cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring
them by [[rule]] in [[good]] workmanlike [[fashion]]. meanwhile calypso came back
with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers
together with bolts and rivets. he made the raft as broad as a skilled
shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he filed a deck on
top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. he also made a mast
with a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. he fenced the raft all
round with wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then
he threw on a quantity of wood. by and by calypso brought him some
linen to make the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making
them fast with braces and sheets. [[last]] of all, with the [[help]] of levers,
he drew the raft down into the water. 

in four days he had completed the whole [[work]], and on the fifth calypso
sent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean
clothes. she gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another
larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions,
and found him in much [[good]] meat. moreover, she made the wind fair
and warm for him, and gladly did [[ulysses]] spread his sail before it,
while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder.
he never closed his [[eyes]], but kept them fixed on the pleiads, on late-setting
bootes, and on the bear- which [[men]] also call the wain, and which turns
round and round where it is, facing orion, and alone never dipping
into the stream of oceanus- for calypso had told him to keep this
to his left. days seven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the
eighteenth the dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of
the phaeacian coast appeared, rising like a shield on the horizon.

but [[king]] [[neptune]], who was returning from the ethiopians, caught sight
of [[ulysses]] a long way off, from the mountains of the solymi. he could
see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged
his head and muttered to himself, saying, heavens [[heaven]], so the gods have
been changing their minds [[mind]] about [[ulysses]] while i was away in ethiopia,
and now he is close to the [[land]] of the phaeacians, where it is decreed
that he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. still,
he shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with it."

thereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred
it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows
till [[earth]], sea, and [[sky]] were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth
out of the heavens [[heaven]]. winds from east, south, north, and west fell upon
him all at the same [[time]], and a tremendous sea got up, so that ulysses'
heart began to fail him. "alas," he said to himself in his dismay,
"what ever will become of me? i am afraid calypso was [[right]] when she
said i should have trouble by sea before i got back [[home]]. it is all
coming true. how black is jove making [[heaven]] with his clouds, and
what a sea the winds are raising from every quarter at once. i am
now safe to perish. blest and thrice blest were those danaans who
fell before troy in the cause of the sons [[son]] of atreus. would that had
been killed on the day when the trojans were pressing me so sorely
about the [[dead]] [[body]] of achilles, for then i should have had due burial
and the achaeans would have honoured my name; but now it seems that
i shall come to a most pitiable end." 

as he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the
raft reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. he
let go the helm, and the [[force]] of the hurricane was so [[great]] that
it broke the mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into
the sea. for a long [[time]] [[ulysses]] was under water, and it was all he
could do to rise to the surface again, for the clothes calypso had
given him weighed him down; but at [[last]] he got his head above water
and spat out the bitter brine that was running down his face in streams.
in spite of all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft,
but swam as fast as he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed
on board again so as to escape drowning. the sea took the raft and
tossed it about as autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round
upon a road. it was as though the south, north, east, and west winds
were all playing battledore and shuttlecock with it at once.

when he was in this plight, ino [[daughter]] of cadmus, also called leucothea,
saw him. she had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been since raised
to the rank of a marine [[goddess]]. seeing in what [[great]] distress ulysses
now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull
from the waves, took her seat upon the raft. 

"my [[poor]] [[good]] [[man]]," said she, "why is [[neptune]] so furiously angry with
you? he is giving you a [[great]] deal of trouble, but for all his bluster
he will not kill you. you seem to be a sensible [[person]], do then as
i bid you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind, and swim
to the phaecian coast where [[better]] [[luck]] awaits you. and here, take
my veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can
come to no harm so long as you wear it. as soon as you touch land
take it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then
go away again." with these words she took off her veil and gave it
him. then she dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath
the dark blue waters. 

but [[ulysses]] did not [[know]] what to [[think]]. "alas," he said to himself
in his dismay, "this is only some one or other of the gods who is
luring me to ruin by advising me to will quit my raft. at any rate
i will not do so at [[present]], for the [[land]] where she said i should
be quit of all troubles seemed to be still a [[good]] way off. i know
what i will do- i am sure it will be best- no matter what happens
i will stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but
when the sea breaks her up i will swim for it; i do not see how i
can do any [[better]] than this." 

while he was thus in two minds [[mind]], [[neptune]] sent a terrible [[great]] wave
that seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke [[right]] over
the raft, which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry
chaff tossed about by a whirlwind. [[ulysses]] got astride of one plank
and rode upon it as if he were on horseback; he then took off the
clothes calypso had given him, bound ino's veil under his arms, and
plunged into the sea- meaning to swim on shore. [[king]] [[neptune]] watched
him as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying,
"'there now, swim up and down as you [[best]] can till you fall in with
well-to-do [[people]]. i do not [[think]] you will be able to say that i have
let you off too lightly." on this he lashed his horses and drove to
aegae where his palace is. 

but minerva resolved to [[help]] [[ulysses]], so she bound the ways of all
the winds except one, and made them [[lie]] quite still; but she roused
a [[good]] stiff breeze from the north that should lay the waters till
ulysses reached the [[land]] of the phaeacians where he would be safe.

thereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water,
with a heavy swell on the sea and [[death]] staring him in the face; but
when the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a [[dead]] calm
without so much as a breath of air stirring. as he rose on the swell
he looked eagerly ahead, and could see [[land]] quite near. then, as children
rejoice when their dear [[father]] begins to get [[better]] after having for
a long [[time]] borne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but
the gods deliver him from [[evil]], so was [[ulysses]] thankful when he again
saw [[land]] and trees, and swam on with all his [[strength]] that he might
once more set foot upon dry ground. when, however, he got within earshot,
he began to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the
swell still broke against them with a terrific roar. everything was
enveloped in spray; there were no harbours where a ship might ride,
nor shelter of any [[kind]], but only headlands, low-lying rocks, and
mountain tops. 

ulysses' [[heart]] now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to
himself, "alas, jove has let me see [[land]] after swimming so far that
i had given up all [[hope]], but i can find no landing place, for the
coast is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer
from the sea, with deep water close under them so that i cannot climb
out for want of foothold. i am afraid some [[great]] wave will lift me
off my legs and dash me against the rocks as i leave the water- which
would give me a [[sorry]] landing. if, on the other hand, i swim further
in search of some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry
me out to sea again sorely against my will, or [[heaven]] may send some
great monster of the deep to attack me; for amphitrite breeds many
such, and i [[know]] that [[neptune]] is very angry with me." 

while he was thus in two minds [[mind]] a wave caught him and took him with
such [[force]] against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn
to pieces if minerva had not shown him what to do. he caught hold
of the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with [[pain]] till
the wave retired, so he was saved that [[time]]; but presently the wave
came on again and carried him back with it far into the sea-tearing
his hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks
it from its bed, and the stones come up along with it even so did
the rocks tear the skin from his [[strong]] hands, and then the wave drew
him deep down under the water. 

here [[poor]] [[ulysses]] would have certainly perished even in spite of his
own [[destiny]], if minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about
him. he swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating
against the [[land]], and at the same [[time]] he kept looking towards the
shore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take
the waves aslant. by and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of
a river, and here he [[thought]] would be the [[best]] place, for there were
no rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. he [[felt]] that there
was a current, so he prayed inwardly and said: 

"hear me, o [[king]], whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of
the sea-god [[neptune]], for i approach you prayerfully. any one who has
lost his way has at all times [[time]] a claim even upon the gods, wherefore
in my distress i draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees
of your riverhood. have [[mercy]] upon me, o [[king]], for i declare myself
your suppliant." 

then the [[god]] stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm
before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. here
at [[last]] ulysses' knees and [[strong]] hands failed him, for the sea had
completely broken him. his [[body]] was all swollen, and his mouth and
nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither
breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,
when he had got his breath and came to himself again, he took off
the scarf that ino had given him and threw it back into the salt stream
of the river, whereon ino received it into her hands from the wave
that bore it towards her. then he left the river, laid himself down
among the rushes, and kissed the bounteous [[earth]]. 

"alas," he cried to himself in his dismay, "what ever will become
of me, and how is it all to end? if i stay here upon the river bed
through the long watches of the night, i am so exhausted that the
bitter cold and damp may make an end of me- for towards sunrise there
will be a keen wind blowing from off the river. if, on the other hand,
i climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some
thicket, i may escape the cold and have a [[good]] night's rest, but some
savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me." 

in the end he deemed it [[best]] to take to the woods, and he found one
upon some high ground not far from the water. there he crept beneath
two shoots of olive that grew from a [[single]] stock- the one an ungrafted
sucker, while the other had been grafted. no wind, however squally,
could break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun's rays
pierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow
into one another. [[ulysses]] crept under these and began to make himself
a bed to [[lie]] on, for there was a [[great]] litter of [[dead]] leaves lying
about- enough to make a covering for two or three [[men]] even in hard
winter weather. he was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself
down and heaped the leaves all round him. then, as one who lives [[life]] alone
in the [[country]], far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed
in the ashes to save himself from having to get a [[light]] elsewhere,
even so did [[ulysses]] cover himself up with leaves; and minerva shed
a sweet sleep upon his [[eyes]], closed his eyelids, and made him lose
all memories of his sorrows [[sorrow]]. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book vi

so here [[ulysses]] slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but minerva went
off to the [[country]] and [[city]] of the phaecians- a [[people]] who used to
live in the [[fair]] town of hypereia, near the lawless cyclopes. now
the cyclopes were stronger than they and plundered them, so their
king nausithous moved them thence and settled them in scheria, far
from all other [[people]]. he surrounded the [[city]] with a wall, built houses
and temples, and divided the lands [[land]] among his [[people]]; but he was dead
and gone to the house of [[hades]], and [[king]] alcinous, whose counsels
were inspired of [[heaven]], was now reigning. to his house, then, did
minerva hie in furtherance of the return of [[ulysses]]. 

she went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there
slept a girl who was as lovely as a [[goddess]], nausicaa, [[daughter]] to
king alcinous. two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very
pretty, one on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well-made
folding doors. minerva took the form of the famous sea captain dymas's
daughter, who was a bosom friend of nausicaa and just her own [[age]];
then, coming up to the girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered
over her head and said: 

"nausicaa, what can your [[mother]] have been about, to have such a lazy
daughter? here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are
going to be [[married]] almost immediately, and should not only be well
dressed yourself, but should find [[good]] clothes for those who attend
you. this is the way to get yourself a [[good]] name, and to make your
father and [[mother]] proud of you. suppose, then, that we make tomorrow
a washing day, and start at daybreak. i will come and [[help]] you so
that you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the
best [[young]] [[men]] among your own [[people]] are courting you, and you are
not going to remain a maid much longer. ask your [[father]], therefore,
to have a waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs,
robes, and girdles; and you can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter
for you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way from the
town." 

when she had said this minerva went away to [[olympus]], which they say
is the everlasting [[home]] of the gods. here no wind beats roughly, and
neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine
and in a [[great]] peacefulness of [[light]], wherein the blessed gods are
illumined for ever and ever. this was the place to which the goddess
went when she had given instructions to the girl. 

by and by morning came and woke nausicaa, who began wondering about
her [[dream]]; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell
her [[father]] and [[mother]] all about it, and found them in their own room.
her [[mother]] was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with
her maids around her, and she happened to catch her [[father]] just as
he was going out to attend a meeting of the town council, which the
phaeacian aldermen had convened. she stopped him and said:

"papa dear, could you manage to let me have a [[good]] big waggon? i want
to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. you are
the [[chief]] [[man]] here, so it is only [[right]] that you should have a clean
shirt when you attend meetings of the council. moreover, you have
five sons [[son]] at [[home]], two of them [[married]], while the other three are
good-looking bachelors; you [[know]] they always like to have clean linen
when they go to a dance, and i have been thinking about all this."

she did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like
to, but her [[father]] knew and said, "you shall have the mules, my [[love]],
and whatever else you have a [[mind]] for. be off with you, and the men
shall get you a [[good]] [[strong]] waggon with a [[body]] to it that will hold
all your clothes." 

on this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out,
harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the clothes
down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. her mother
prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of [[good]] things,
and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon, and
her [[mother]] gave her also a golden cruse of [[oil]], that she and her women
might anoint themselves. then she took the whip and reins and lashed
the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on the
road. they pulled without flagging, and carried not only nausicaa
and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were with her.

when they reached the water side they went to the washing-cisterns,
through which there ran at all times [[time]] enough pure water to wash any
quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. here they unharnessed the
mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that
grew by the water side. they took the clothes out of the waggon, put
them in the water, and vied with one another in treading them in the
pits to get the dirt out. after they had washed them and got them
quite clean, they laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had
raised a high beach of shingle, and set about washing themselves and
anointing themselves with olive [[oil]]. then they got their dinner by
the side of the stream, and waited for the sun to finish drying the
clothes. when they had done dinner they threw off the veils that covered
their heads and began to play at ball, while nausicaa sang for them.
as the huntress diana goes forth upon the mountains of taygetus or
erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer, and the wood-nymphs, daughters
of aegis-bearing jove, take their [[sport]] along with her (then is leto
proud at seeing her [[daughter]] stand a full head taller than the others,
and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so
did the girl outshine her handmaids. 

when it was [[time]] for them to start [[home]], and they were folding the
clothes and putting them into the waggon, minerva began to consider
how [[ulysses]] should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct
him to the [[city]] of the phaeacians. the girl, therefore, threw a ball
at one of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. on
this they all shouted, and the noise they made woke [[ulysses]], who sat
up in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.

"alas," said he to himself, "what [[kind]] of [[people]] have i come amongst?
are they cruel, savage, and uncivilized, or hospitable and humane?
i seem to hear the voices of [[young]] [[women]], and they sound like those
of the nymphs [[nymph]] that haunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows
of green grass. at any rate i am among a [[race]] of [[men]] and [[women]]. let
me try if i cannot manage to get a look at them." 

as he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough
covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. he looked like some
lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength
and defying both wind and rain; his [[eyes]] glare as he prowls in quest
of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even
into a well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep- even such
did [[ulysses]] seem to the [[young]] [[women]], as he drew near to them all naked
as he was, for he was in [[great]] want. on seeing one so unkempt and
so begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off along the spits
that jutted out into the sea, but the [[daughter]] of alcinous stood firm,
for minerva put [[courage]] into her [[heart]] and took away all [[fear]] from
her. she stood [[right]] in front of [[ulysses]], and he doubted whether he
should go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees
as a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her to give him some
clothes and show him the way to the town. in the end he deemed it
best to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offence
at his coming near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her
in honeyed and persuasive [[language]]. 

"o queen," he said, "i implore your aid- but tell me, are you a goddess
or are you a mortal woman? if you are a [[goddess]] and dwell in [[heaven]],
i can only conjecture that you are jove's [[daughter]] diana, for your
face and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are
a mortal and [[live]] on [[earth]], thrice [[happy]] are your [[father]] and mother-
thrice [[happy]], too, are your brothers [[brother]] and sisters; how proud and delighted
they must [[feel]] when they see so [[fair]] a scion as yourself going out
to a dance; most [[happy]], however, of all will he be whose wedding gifts
have been the richest, and who takes you to his own [[home]]. i never
yet saw any one so beautiful, neither [[man]] nor woman, and am lost in
admiration as i behold you. i can only compare you to a [[young]] palm
tree which i saw when i was at delos growing near the altar of apollo-
for i was there, too, with much [[people]] after me, when i was on that
journey which has been the source of all my troubles. never yet did
such a [[young]] plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and i admired
and wondered at it exactly as i now [[admire]] and wonder at yourself.
i dare not clasp your knees, but i am in [[great]] distress; yesterday
made the twentieth day that i had been tossing about upon the sea.
the winds and waves have taken me all the way from the ogygian island,
and now [[fate]] has flung me upon this coast that i may endure still
further suffering; for i do not [[think]] that i have yet come to the
end of it, but rather that [[heaven]] has still much [[evil]] in store for
me. 

"and now, o queen, have [[pity]] upon me, for you are the first person
i have met, and i [[know]] no one else in this [[country]]. show me the way
to your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither
to wrap your clothes in. may [[heaven]] grant you in all things your heart's
desire- husband, house, and a [[happy]], peaceful [[home]]; for there is nothing
better in this [[world]] than that [[man]] and [[wife]] should be of one mind
in a house. it discomfits their enemies [[enemy]], makes the hearts [[heart]] of their
friends glad, and they themselves [[know]] more about it than any one."

to this nausicaa answered, "stranger, you appear to be a sensible,
well-disposed [[person]]. there is no accounting for [[luck]]; jove gives
prosperity to [[rich]] and [[poor]] just as he chooses, so you must take what
he has seen fit to send you, and make the [[best]] of it. now, however,
that you have come to this our [[country]], you shall not want for clothes
nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably
look for. i will show you the way to the town, and will tell you the
name of our [[people]]; we are called phaeacians, and i am [[daughter]] to
alcinous, in whom the whole [[power]] of the [[state]] is vested."

then she called her maids and said, "stay where you are, you girls.
can you not see a [[man]] without running away from him? do you take him
for a robber or a murderer? neither he nor any one else can come here
to do us phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live
apart on a land's end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing
to do with any other [[people]]. this is only some [[poor]] [[man]] who has lost
his way, and we must be [[kind]] to him, for strangers and foreigners
in distress are under jove's protection, and will take what they can
get and be thankful; so, girls, give the [[poor]] fellow something to
eat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered
from the wind." 

on this the maids left off running away and began calling one another
back. they made [[ulysses]] sit down in the shelter as nausicaa had told
them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. they also brought him the
little golden cruse of [[oil]], and told him to go wash in the stream.
but [[ulysses]] said, "young [[women]], please to stand a little on one side
that i may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with
oil, for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of [[oil]] upon
it. i cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. i am ashamed
to strip before a number of good-looking [[young]] [[women]]." 

then they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while ulysses
washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back
and from his broad shoulders. when he had thoroughly washed himself,
and had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with [[oil]],
and put on the clothes which the girl had given him; minerva then
made him look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair
grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth
blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful
workman who has [[studied]] art [[arts]] of all kinds [[kind]] under vulcan and minerva
enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it- and his [[work]] is full
of [[beauty]]. then he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach,
looking quite [[young]] and handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration;
then she said to her maids: 

"hush, my dears, for i want to say something. i [[believe]] the gods who
live in [[heaven]] have sent this [[man]] to the phaeacians. when i first
saw him i [[thought]] him plain, but now his appearance is like that of
the gods who dwell in [[heaven]]. i should like my future husband to be
just such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want
to go away. however, give him something to [[eat]] and drink."

they did as they were told, and set food before [[ulysses]], who ate and
drank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any [[kind]].
meanwhile, nausicaa bethought her of another matter. she got the linen
folded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as
she took her seat, she called [[ulysses]]: 

"stranger," said she, "rise and let us be going back to the town;
i will introduce you at the house of my excellent [[father]], where i
can tell you that you will meet all the [[best]] [[people]] among the phaecians.
but be sure and do as i bid you, for you seem to be a sensible [[person]].
as long as we are going [[past]] the fields- and farm lands [[land]], [[follow]] briskly
behind the waggon along with the maids and i will lead the way myself.
presently, however, we shall come to the town, where you will find
a high wall running all round it, and a [[good]] harbour on either side
with a narrow entrance into the [[city]], and the ships will be drawn
up by the road side, for every one has a place where his own ship
can [[lie]]. you will see the market place with a temple of [[neptune]] in
the middle of it, and paved with large stones bedded in the [[earth]].
here [[people]] deal in ship's gear of all kinds [[kind]], such as cables and sails,
and here, too, are the places where oars are made, for the phaeacians
are not a nation of archers; they [[know]] nothing about bows and arrows,
but are a sea-faring folk, and [[pride]] themselves on their masts, oars,
and ships, with which they travel far over the sea. 

"i am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against
me later on; for the [[people]] here are very ill-natured, and some low
fellow, if he met us, might say, 'who is this fine-looking stranger
that is going about with nausicaa? where did she end him? i suppose
she is going to [[marry]] him. perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she
has taken from some [[foreign]] vessel, for we have no neighbours; or
some [[god]] has at [[last]] come down from [[heaven]] in [[answer]] to her prayers,
and she is going to [[live]] with him all the rest of her [[life]]. it would
be a [[good]] thing if she would take herself of i for sh and find a husband
somewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent
young phaeacians who are in with her.' this is the [[kind]] of disparaging
remark that would be made about me, and i could not [[complain]], for
i should myself be scandalized at seeing any other girl do the like,
and go about with [[men]] in spite of everybody, while her [[father]] and
mother were still alive, and without having been [[married]] in the face
of all the [[world]]. 

"if, therefore, you want my [[father]] to give you an escort and to help
you [[home]], do as i bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars
by the road side dedicated to minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow
all round it. here my [[father]] has a field of [[rich]] garden ground, about
as far from the town as a man' voice will carry. sit down there and
wait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach
my father's house. then, when you [[think]] we must have done this, come
into the town and ask the way to the house of my [[father]] alcinous.
you will have no difficulty in finding it; any child will point it
out to you, for no one else in the whole town has anything like such
a fine house as he has. when you have got [[past]] the gates and through
the outer court, go [[right]] across the inner court till you come to
my [[mother]]. you will find her sitting by the [[fire]] and spinning her
purple wool by firelight. it is a fine sight to see her as she leans
back against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind
her. close to her seat stands that of my [[father]], on which he sits
and topes like an [[immortal]] [[god]]. never [[mind]] him, but go up to my [[mother]],
and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get [[home]] quickly. if
you can gain her over, you may [[hope]] to see your own [[country]] again,
no matter how distant it may be." 

so saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.
the mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.
she was careful not to go too fast for [[ulysses]] and the maids who were
following on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with
judgement. as the sun was going down they came to the [[sacred]] grove
of minerva, and there [[ulysses]] sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter
of jove. 

"hear me," he cried, "daughter of aegis-bearing jove, unweariable,
hear me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when [[neptune]] was wrecking
me. now, therefore, have [[pity]] upon me and grant that i may find friends
and be hospitably received by the phaecians." 

thus did he [[pray]], and minerva heard his prayer, but she would not
show herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle [[neptune]],
who was still furious in his endeavors to prevent [[ulysses]] from getting
home. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book vii

thus, then, did [[ulysses]] wait and [[pray]]; but the girl drove on to the
town. when she reached her father's house she drew up at the gateway,
and her brothers- comely as the gods- gathered round her, took the
mules out of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while
she went to her own room, where an old servant, eurymedusa of apeira,
lit the [[fire]] for her. this old woman had been brought by sea from
apeira, and had been chosen as a prize for alcinous because he was
king over the phaecians, and the [[people]] obeyed him as though he were
a [[god]]. she had been nurse to nausicaa, and had now lit the [[fire]] for
her, and brought her supper for her into her own room. 

presently [[ulysses]] got up to go towards the town; and minerva shed
a thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud phaecians
who met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. then, as
he was just entering the town, she came towards him in the likeness
of a little girl carrying a pitcher. she stood [[right]] in front of him,
and [[ulysses]] said: 

"my dear, will you be so [[kind]] as to show me the house of [[king]] alcinous?
i am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not [[know]] one in
your town and [[country]]." 

then minerva said, "yes, [[father]] stranger, i will show you the house
you want, for alcinous lives [[life]] quite close to my own [[father]]. i will
go before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and
do not look at any [[man]], nor ask him questions [[question]]; for the [[people]] here
cannot abide strangers, and do not like [[men]] who come from some other
place. they are a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace
of [[neptune]] in ships that glide along like [[thought]], or as a bird in
the air." 

on this she [[led]] the way, and [[ulysses]] followed in her steps; but not
one of the phaecians could see him as he passed through the [[city]] in
the midst of them; for the [[great]] [[goddess]] minerva in her [[good]] will
towards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. he admired
their harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of
the [[city]], which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking,
and when they reached the king's house minerva said: 

"this is the house, [[father]] stranger, which you would have me show
you. you will find a number of [[great]] [[people]] sitting at table, but
do not be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a [[man]] is the more
likely he is to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. first
find the queen. her name is arete, and she comes of the same family
as her husband alcinous. they both descend originally from [[neptune]],
who was [[father]] to nausithous by periboea, a woman of [[great]] [[beauty]].
periboea was the youngest [[daughter]] of eurymedon, who at one [[time]] reigned
over the giants, but he ruined his ill-fated [[people]] and lost his own
life to boot. 

"neptune, however, lay with his [[daughter]], and she had a [[son]] by him,
the [[great]] nausithous, who reigned over the phaecians. nausithous had
two sons [[son]] rhexenor and alcinous; [[apollo]] killed the first of them while
he was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter
arete, whom alcinous [[married]], and honours [[honour]] as no other woman is honoured
of all those that keep house along with their husbands. 

"thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her
children, by alcinous himself, and by the whole [[people]], who look upon
her as a [[goddess]], and greet her whenever she goes about the [[city]],
for she is a thoroughly [[good]] woman both in head and [[heart]], and when
any [[women]] are [[friends]] of hers, she will [[help]] their husbands also to
settle their disputes. if you can gain her [[good]] will, you may have
every [[hope]] of seeing your [[friends]] again, and getting safely back to
your [[home]] and [[country]]." 

then minerva left scheria and went away over the sea. she went to
marathon and to the spacious streets of [[athens]], where she entered
the abode of erechtheus; but [[ulysses]] went on to the house of alcinous,
and he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold
of bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun
or moon. the walls on either side were of bronze from end to end,
and the cornice was of blue enamel. the doors were gold, and hung
on pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel
was silver and the hook of the door was of gold. 

on either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which vulcan,
with his consummate [[skill]], had fashioned expressly to keep watch over
the palace of [[king]] alcinous; so they were [[immortal]] and could never
grow old. seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from
one end to the other, with coverings of fine woven [[work]] which the
women of the house had made. here the [[chief]] persons [[person]] of the phaecians
used to sit and [[eat]] and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons;
and there were golden figures of [[young]] [[men]] with lighted torches in
their hands, raised on pedestals, to give [[light]] by night to those
who were at table. there are fifty maid servants in the house, some
of whom are always grinding [[rich]] yellow grain at the mill, while others
work at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go, backwards
and forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen
is so closely woven that it will turn [[oil]]. as the phaecians are the
best sailors in the [[world]], so their [[women]] excel all others in weaving,
for minerva has taught them all manner of useful [[arts]], and they are
very [[intelligent]]. 

outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about
four acres with a wall all round it. it is full of beautiful trees-
pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. there are luscious
figs also, and olives in full [[growth]]. the fruits never rot nor fail
all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so soft
that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. pear grows on pear,
apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for there
is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this, the
grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being
gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further
on have shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others
again are just changing colour. in the furthest part of the ground
there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all
the year round. two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts
throughout the whole garden, while the other is carried under the
ground of the outer court to the house itself, and the town's people
draw water from it. such, then, were the splendours with which the
gods had endowed the house of [[king]] alcinous. 

so here [[ulysses]] stood for a while and looked about him, but when he
had looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the
precincts of the house. there he found all the [[chief]] [[people]] among
the phaecians making their drink-offerings to mercury, which they
always did the [[last]] thing before going away for the night. he went
straight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness
in which minerva had enveloped him, till he reached arete and king
alcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and
at that moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became
visible. every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a [[man]] there,
but [[ulysses]] began at once with his petition. 

"queen arete," he exclaimed, "daughter of [[great]] rhexenor, in my distress
i humbly [[pray]] you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom
may [[heaven]] [[prosper]] with long [[life]] and [[happiness]], and may they leave
their possessions to their [[children]], and all the honours [[honour]] conferred
upon them by the state) to [[help]] me [[home]] to my own [[country]] as soon
as possible; for i have been long in trouble and away from my [[friends]]."

then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their
peace, till presently the old hero echeneus, who was an excellent
speaker and an elder among the phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty
addressed them thus: 

"alcinous," said he, "it is not creditable to you that a stranger
should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is
waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise
and take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants
mix some wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to jove
the [[lord]] of thunder, who takes all well-disposed suppliants under
his protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever
there may be in the house." 

when alcinous heard this he took [[ulysses]] by the hand, raised him from
the hearth, and bade him take the seat of laodamas, who had been sitting
beside him, and was his favourite [[son]]. a maid servant then brought
him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin
for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him;
an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many [[good]] things
of what there was in the house, and [[ulysses]] ate and drank. then alcinous
said to one of the servants, "pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand
it round that we may make drink-offerings to jove the [[lord]] of thunder,
who is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants." 

pontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving
every [[man]] his drink-offering. when they had made their offerings,
and had drunk each as much as he was minded, alcinous said:

"aldermen and town councillors of the phaeacians, hear my words. you
have had your supper, so now go [[home]] to bed. to-morrow morning i shall
invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial
banquet in [[honour]] of our guest; we can then discuss the [[question]] of
his escort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing
to his own [[country]] without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no
matter how distant it may be. we must see that he comes to no harm
while on his homeward [[journey]], but when he is once at [[home]] he will
have to take the [[luck]] he was born with for [[better]] or worse like other
people. it is possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals
who has come down from [[heaven]] to visit us; but in this case the gods
are departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made
themselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them hecatombs.
they come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves, and if
any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other of
them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the
gods as the cyclopes and the savage giants are." 

then [[ulysses]] said: "pray, alcinous, do not take any such notion into
your head. i have nothing of the [[immortal]] about me, neither in body
nor [[mind]], and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.
indeed, were i to tell you all that [[heaven]] has seen fit to lay upon
me, you would say that i was still worse off than they are. nevertheless,
let me sup in spite of [[sorrow]], for an empty stomach is a very importunate
thing, and thrusts itself on a man's [[man]] notice no matter how dire is
his distress. i am in [[great]] trouble, yet it insists that i shall eat
and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows [[sorrow]] and dwell only
on the due replenishing of itself. as for yourselves, do as you propose,
and at break of day set about helping me to get [[home]]. i shall be content
to [[die]] if i may first once more behold my [[property]], my bondsmen, and
all the greatness of my house." 

thus did he speak. every one approved his saying, and agreed that
he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. then
when they had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much
as he was minded they went [[home]] to bed every [[man]] in his own abode,
leaving [[ulysses]] in the cloister with arete and alcinous while the
servants were taking the things away after supper. arete was the first
to speak, for she recognized the shirt, cloak, and [[good]] clothes that
ulysses was wearing, as the [[work]] of herself and of her maids; so she
said, "stranger, before we go any further, there is a [[question]] i should
like to ask you. who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes?
did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?" 

and [[ulysses]] answered, "it would be a long story madam, were i to relate
in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of [[heaven]] has been
laid heavy upon me; but as regards your [[question]], there is an island
far away in the sea which is called 'the ogygian.' here dwells the
cunning and powerful [[goddess]] calypso, [[daughter]] of atlas. she lives
by herself far from all neighbours [[human]] or [[divine]]. [[fortune]], however,
me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for jove struck my ship with
his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. my brave comrades
were drowned every [[man]] of them, but i stuck to the keel and was carried
hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at [[last]] during
the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the ogygian
island where the [[great]] [[goddess]] calypso lives [[life]]. she took me in and treated
me with the utmost [[kindness]]; indeed she wanted to make me immortal
that i might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let
her do so. 

"i stayed with calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the
good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole [[time]]; but
at [[last]] when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her
own [[free]] will, either because jove had told her she must, or because
she had changed her [[mind]]. she sent me from her island on a raft, which
she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. moreover she gave
me [[good]] stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and
fair. days seven and ten did i sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth
i caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast-
and glad indeed was i to set [[eyes]] upon them. nevertheless there was
still much trouble in store for me, for at this point [[neptune]] would
let me go no further, and raised a [[great]] storm against me; the sea
was so terribly high that i could no longer keep to my raft, which
went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and i had to swim for it,
till wind and current brought me to your shores. 

"there i tried to [[land]], but could not, for it was a [[bad]] place and
the waves dashed me against the rocks, so i again took to the sea
and swam on till i came to a river that seemed the most likely landing
place, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind.
here, then, i got out of the water and gathered my senses together
again. night was coming on, so i left the river, and went into a thicket,
where i covered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven
sent me off into a very deep sleep. sick and [[sorry]] as i was i slept
among the leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon,
when i woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter's maid
servants playing upon the beach, and your [[daughter]] among them looking
like a [[goddess]]. i besought her aid, and she proved to be of an excellent
disposition, much more so than could be expected from so [[young]] a person-
for [[young]] [[people]] are apt to be thoughtless. she gave me plenty of
bread and wine, and when she had had me washed in the river she also
gave me the clothes in which you see me. now, therefore, though it
has pained me to do so, i have told you the whole [[truth]]."

then alcinous said, "stranger, it was very [[wrong]] of my [[daughter]] not
to bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that
she was the first [[person]] whose aid you [[asked]]." 

"pray do not scold her," replied [[ulysses]]; "she is not to blame. she
did tell me to [[follow]] along with the maids, but i was ashamed and
afraid, for i [[thought]] you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me.
every [[human]] being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable."

"stranger," replied alcinous, "i am not the [[kind]] of [[man]] to get angry
about nothing; it is always [[better]] to be reasonable; but by father
jove, minerva, and [[apollo]], now that i see what [[kind]] of [[person]] you
are, and how much you [[think]] as i do, i [[wish]] you would stay here, marry
my [[daughter]], and become my son-in-law. if you will stay i will give
you a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you
here against your own [[wish]], and that you may be sure of this i will
attend to-morrow to the matter of your escort. you can sleep during
the whole [[voyage]] if you like, and the [[men]] shall sail you over smooth
waters either to your own [[home]], or wherever you please, even though
it be a long way further off than euboea, which those of my people
who saw it when they took yellow-haired rhadamanthus to see tityus
the [[son]] of gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place- and yet they
did the whole [[voyage]] in a [[single]] day without distressing themselves,
and came back again afterwards. you will thus see how much my ships
excel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are."

then was [[ulysses]] glad and prayed aloud saying, "father jove, grant
that alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will [[win]] an imperishable
name among [[mankind]], and at the same [[time]] i shall return to my [[country]]."

thus did they converse. then arete told her maids to set a bed in
the room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with [[good]] red rugs,
and to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for
ulysses to wear. the maids thereon went out with torches in their
hands, and when they had made the bed they came up to [[ulysses]] and
said, "rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,"
and glad indeed was he to go to his rest. 

so [[ulysses]] slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;
but alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his
wife by his side. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book viii

now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, alcinous
and [[ulysses]] both rose, and alcinous [[led]] the way to the phaecian place
of assembly, which was near the ships. when they got there they sat
down side by side on a seat of polished stone, while minerva took
the form of one of alcinous' servants, and went round the town in
order to [[help]] [[ulysses]] to get [[home]]. she went up to the [[citizens]], man
by [[man]], and said, "aldermen and town councillors of the phaeacians,
come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has
just come off a long [[voyage]] to the house of [[king]] alcinous; he looks
like an [[immortal]] [[god]]." 

with these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked
to the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. every
one was struck with the appearance of [[ulysses]], for minerva had beautified
him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter
than he really was, that he might impress the phaecians favourably
as being a very remarkable [[man]], and might come off well in the many
trials of [[skill]] to which they would challenge him. then, when they
were got together, alcinous spoke: 

"hear me," said he, "aldermen and town councillors of the phaeacians,
that i may speak even as i am minded. this stranger, whoever he may
be, has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either east
or west. he wants an escort and wishes [[wish]] to have the matter settled.
let us then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before
him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to
complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. let us draw
a ship into the sea- one that has never yet made a voyage- and man
her with two and fifty of our smartest [[young]] sailors. then when you
have made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and
come to my house to prepare a feast. i will find you in everything.
i am giving will these instructions to the [[young]] [[men]] who will form
the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will
join me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters. i can take no
excuses, and we will have demodocus to sing to us; for there is no
bard like him whatever he may choose to sing about." 

alcinous then [[led]] the way, and the others followed after, while a
servant went to fetch demodocus. the fifty-two picked oarsmen went
to the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they
drew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound
the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in
due course, and spread the [[white]] sails aloft. they moored the vessel
a little way out from [[land]], and then came on shore and went to the
house of [[king]] alcinous. the outhouses, yards, and all the precincts
were filled with crowds of [[men]] in [[great]] multitudes both old and [[young]];
and alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and
two oxen. these they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent
banquet. 

a servant presently [[led]] in the famous bard demodocus, whom the muse
had dearly loved, but to whom she had given both [[good]] and [[evil]], for
though she had endowed him with a [[divine]] gift of [[song]], she had robbed
him of his eyesight. pontonous set a seat for him among the guests,
leaning it up against a bearing-post. he hung the lyre for him on
a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to [[feel]] for it with
his hands. he also set a [[fair]] table with a basket of victuals by his
side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was
so disposed. 

the company then laid their hands upon the [[good]] things that were before
them, but as soon as they had had enough to [[eat]] and drink, the muse
inspired demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially
a matter that was then in the mouths of all [[men]], to wit, the quarrel
between [[ulysses]] and achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped
on one another as they gat together at a banquet. but [[agamemnon]] was
glad when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for
apollo had foretold him this at pytho when he crossed the stone floor
to consult the oracle. here was the beginning of the [[evil]] that by
the will of jove fell both danaans and trojans. 

thus sang the bard, but [[ulysses]] drew his purple mantle over his head
and covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the phaeacians see
that he was weeping. when the bard left off singing he wiped the tears
from his [[eyes]], uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering
to the gods; but when the phaeacians pressed demodocus to sing further,
for they delighted in his lays, then [[ulysses]] again drew his mantle
over his head and wept bitterly. no one noticed his distress except
alcinous, who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that
he was heaving. so he at once said, "aldermen and town councillors
of the phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast, and
of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore
to the athletic sports [[sport]], so that our guest on his return [[home]] may be
able to tell his [[friends]] how much we surpass all other nations as
boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners." 

with these words he [[led]] the way, and the others followed after. a
servant hung demodocus's lyre on its peg for him, [[led]] him out of the
cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the
chief [[men]] of the phaeacians were going to see the sports [[sport]]; a crowd
of several thousands of [[people]] followed them, and there were many
excellent competitors for all the prizes. acroneos, ocyalus, elatreus,
nauteus, prymneus, anchialus, eretmeus, ponteus, proreus, thoon, anabesineus,
and amphialus [[son]] of polyneus [[son]] of tecton. there was also euryalus
son of naubolus, who was like [[mars]] himself, and was the [[best]] looking
man among the phaecians except laodamas. three sons [[son]] of alcinous, laodamas,
halios, and clytoneus, competed also. 

the foot races [[race]] came first. the course was set out for them from the
starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew
forward at the same moment. clytoneus came in first by a long way;
he left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that
a couple of mules can plough in a fallow field. they then turned to
the painful art [[arts]] of wrestling, and here euryalus proved to be the best
man. amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing
the disc there was no one who could approach elatreus. alcinous's
son laodamas was the [[best]] boxer, and he it was who presently said,
when they had all been diverted with the games, "let us ask the stranger
whether he excels in any of these sports [[sport]]; he seems very powerfully
built; his thighs, claves, hands, and neck are of prodigious [[strength]],
nor is he at all old, but he has [[suffered]] much lately, and there is
nothing like the sea for making havoc with a [[man]], no matter how strong
he is." 

"you are quite [[right]], laodamas," replied euryalus, "go up to your
guest and speak to him about it yourself." 

when laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd
and said to [[ulysses]], "i [[hope]], sir, that you will enter yourself for
some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of
them- and you must have gone in for many a one before now. there is
nothing that does any one so much credit all his [[life]] long as the
showing himself a proper [[man]] with his hands and feet. have a try therefore
at something, and banish all [[sorrow]] from your [[mind]]. your return home
will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water,
and the crew is found." 

ulysses answered, "laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind
is set rather on cares [[care]] than contests; i have been through infinite
trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king
and [[people]] to further me on my return [[home]]." 

then euryalus reviled him outright and said, "i gather, then, that
you are unskilled in any of the many sports [[sport]] that [[men]] generally delight
in. i suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about
in ships as captains or merchants, and who [[think]] of nothing but of
their outward freights and homeward cargoes. there does not seem to
be much of the athlete about you." 

"for shame, sir," answered [[ulysses]], fiercely, "you are an insolent
fellow- so true is it that the gods do not grace all [[men]] alike in
speech, [[person]], and understanding. one [[man]] may be of [[weak]] presence,
but [[heaven]] has adorned this with such a [[good]] conversation that he
charms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his
hearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows,
and wherever he goes he is looked up to. another may be as handsome
as a [[god]], but his [[good]] looks are not crowned with discretion. this
is your case. no [[god]] could make a finer looking fellow than you are,
but you are a [[fool]]. your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly
angry, and you are quite mistaken, for i excel in a [[great]] many athletic
exercises; indeed, so long as i had [[youth]] and [[strength]], i was among
the first athletes of the [[age]]. now, however, i am worn out by labour
and [[sorrow]], for i have gone through much both on the field of battle
and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite of all this i will
compete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick." 

so he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,
larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the phaeacians
when disc-throwing among themselves. then, swinging it back, he threw
it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as
he did so. the phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight
as it sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that
had been made yet. minerva, in the form of a [[man]], came and marked
the place where it had fallen. "a blind [[man]], sir," said she, "could
easily tell your mark by groping for it- it is so far ahead of any
other. you may make your [[mind]] easy about this contest, for no phaeacian
can come near to such a throw as yours." 

ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,
so he began to speak more pleasantly. "young [[men]]," said he, "come
up to that throw if you can, and i will throw another disc as heavy
or even heavier. if anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come
on, for i am exceedingly angry; i will box, wrestle, or run, i do
not [[care]] what it is, with any [[man]] of you all except laodamas, but
not with him because i am his guest, and one cannot compete with one's
own personal friend. at least i do not [[think]] it a prudent or a sensible
thing for a guest to challenge his host's [[family]] at any game, especially
when he is in a [[foreign]] [[country]]. he will cut the ground from under
his own feet if he does; but i make no exception as regards any one
else, for i want to have the matter out and [[know]] which is the best
man. i am a [[good]] hand at every [[kind]] of athletic [[sport]] known among
mankind. i am an excellent archer. in [[battle]] i am always the first
to bring a [[man]] down with my arrow, no matter how many more are taking
aim at him alongside of me. philoctetes was the only [[man]] who could
shoot [[better]] than i could when we achaeans were before troy and in
practice. i far excel every one else in the whole [[world]], of those
who still [[eat]] bread upon the face of the [[earth]], but i should not like
to shoot against the mighty [[dead]], such as hercules, or eurytus the
cechalian-men who could shoot against the gods themselves. this in
fact was how eurytus came prematurely by his end, for [[apollo]] was angry
with him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer. i
can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow. running
is the only point in [[respect]] of which i am afraid some of the phaecians
might beat me, for i have been brought down very low at sea; my provisions
ran short, and therefore i am still [[weak]]." 

they all held their [[peace]] except [[king]] alcinous, who began, "sir, we
have had much [[pleasure]] in hearing all that you have told us, from
which i [[understand]] that you are willing to show your prowess, as having
been displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to
you by one of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered
by any one who knows [[know]] how to talk with propriety. i [[hope]] you will apprehend
my meaning, and will explain to any be one of your [[chief]] [[men]] who may
be dining with yourself and your [[family]] when you get [[home]], that we
have an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds [[kind]]. we are
not particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers,
but we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. we
are extremely fond of [[good]] dinners, [[music]], and dancing; we also like
frequent changes [[change]] of linen, warm baths, and [[good]] beds, so now, please,
some of you who are the [[best]] dancers set about dancing, that our guest
on his return [[home]] may be able to tell his [[friends]] how much we surpass
all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, minstrels. demodocus
has left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of you and
fetch it for him." 

on this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king's house,
and the nine [[men]] who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. it
was their [[business]] to manage everything connected with the sports [[sport]],
so they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.
presently the servant came back with demodocus's lyre, and he took
his place in the midst of them, whereon the [[best]] [[young]] dancers in
the town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that [[ulysses]] was delighted
with the merry twinkling of their feet. 

meanwhile the bard began to sing the loves [[love]] of [[mars]] and [[venus]], and
how they first began their intrigue in the house of vulcan. [[mars]] made
venus many presents [[present]], and defiled [[king]] vulcan's [[marriage]] bed, so the
sun, who saw what they were about, told vulcan. vulcan was very angry
when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding
mischief, got his [[great]] anvil into its place, and began to forge some
chains which none could either unloose or break, so that they might
stay there in that place. when he had finished his snare he went into
his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like
cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the [[great]] beam of the ceiling.
not even a [[god]] could see them, so fine and subtle were they. as soon
as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he
were setting out for the [[fair]] [[state]] of lemnos, which of all places
in the [[world]] was the one he was most fond of. but [[mars]] kept no blind
look out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to his house,
burning with [[love]] for [[venus]]. 

now [[venus]] was just come in from a visit to her [[father]] jove, and was
about sitting down when [[mars]] came inside the house, an said as he
took her hand in his own, "let us go to the couch of vulcan: he is
not at [[home]], but is gone off to lemnos among the sintians, whose speech
is barbarous." 

she was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest,
whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning vulcan had spread
for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found
too late that they were in a trap. then vulcan came up to them, for
he had turned back before reaching lemnos, when his scout the sun
told him what was going on. he was in a furious passion, and stood
in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the
gods. 

"father jove," he cried, "and all you other blessed gods who live
for ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that
i will show you. jove's [[daughter]] [[venus]] is always dishonouring me because
i am lame. she is in [[love]] with [[mars]], who is handsome and clean built,
whereas i am a cripple- but my parents are to blame for that, not
i; they ought never to have begotten me. come and see the pair together
asleep on my bed. it makes me furious to look at them. they are very
fond of one another, but i do not [[think]] they will [[lie]] there longer
than they can [[help]], nor do i [[think]] that they will sleep much; there,
however, they shall stay till her [[father]] has repaid me the sum i gave
him for his baggage of a [[daughter]], who is [[fair]] but not honest."

on this the gods gathered to the house of vulcan. earth-encircling
neptune came, and mercury the bringer of [[luck]], and [[king]] [[apollo]], but
the goddesses [[goddess]] stayed at [[home]] all of them for shame. then the givers
of all [[good]] things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared
with inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning vulcan had
been, whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:

"ill deeds do not [[prosper]], and the [[weak]] confound the [[strong]]. see how
limping vulcan, lame as he is, has caught [[mars]] who is the fleetest
god in [[heaven]]; and now [[mars]] will be cast in heavy damages."

thus did they converse, but [[king]] [[apollo]] said to mercury, "messenger
mercury, giver of [[good]] things, you would not [[care]] how [[strong]] the chains
were, would you, if you could sleep with [[venus]]?" 

"king [[apollo]]," answered mercury, "i only [[wish]] i might get the [[chance]],
though there were three times [[time]] as many chains- and you might look on,
all of you, gods and goddesses [[goddess]], but would sleep with her if i could."

the [[immortal]] gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but neptune
took it all seriously, and kept on imploring vulcan to set [[mars]] free
again. "let him go," he cried, "and i will undertake, as you require,
that he shall [[pay]] you all the damages that are held reasonable among
the [[immortal]] gods." 

"do not," replied vulcan, "ask me to do this; a [[bad]] man's [[man]] bond is
bad security; what remedy could i enforce against you if [[mars]] should
go away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?"

"vulcan," said [[neptune]], "if [[mars]] goes away without paying his damages,
i will [[pay]] you myself." so vulcan answered, "in this case i cannot
and must not refuse you." 

thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were
free they scampered off, [[mars]] to thrace and laughter-loving venus
to cyprus and to paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant
with burnt offerings. here the graces hathed her, and anointed her
with [[oil]] of ambrosia such as the [[immortal]] gods make use of, and they
clothed her in raiment of the most enchanting [[beauty]]. 

thus sang the bard, and both [[ulysses]] and the seafaring phaeacians
were charmed as they heard him. 

then alcinous told laodamas and halius to dance alone, for there was
no one to compete with them. so they took a red ball which polybus
had made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw
it up towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground
and caught it with ease before it came down again. when they had done
throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance, and
at the same [[time]] kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one
another, while all the [[young]] [[men]] in the ring applauded and made a
great stamping with their feet. then [[ulysses]] said: 

"king alcinous, you said your [[people]] were the nimblest dancers in
the [[world]], and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. i was
astonished as i saw them." 

the [[king]] was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the phaecians "aldermen
and town councillors, our guest seems to be a [[person]] of singular judgement;
let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably
expect. there are twelve [[chief]] [[men]] among you, and counting myself
there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean cloak, a shirt,
and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in a lump down
at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with a light
heart. as for euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a
present too, for he has been rude." 

thus did he speak. the others all of them applauded his saying, and
sent their servants to fetch the presents [[present]]. then euryalus said, "king
alcinous, i will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require.
he shall have [[sword]], which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is
of silver. i will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into
which it fits. it will be worth a [[great]] deal to him." 

as he spoke he placed the [[sword]] in the hands of [[ulysses]] and said,
"good [[luck]] to you, [[father]] stranger; if anything has been said amiss
may the winds blow it away with them, and may [[heaven]] grant you a safe
return, for i [[understand]] you have been long away from [[home]], and have
gone through much hardship." 

to which [[ulysses]] answered, "good [[luck]] to you too my friend, and may
the gods grant you every [[happiness]]. i [[hope]] you will not miss the sword
you have given me along with your apology." 

with these words he girded the [[sword]] about his shoulders and towards
sundown the presents [[present]] began to make their appearance, as the servants
of the donors kept bringing them to the house of [[king]] alcinous; here
his sons [[son]] received them, and placed them under their mother's charge.
then alcinous [[led]] the way to the house and bade his guests take their
seats. 

"wife," said he, turning to queen arete, "go, fetch the [[best]] chest
we have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. also, set a copper
on the [[fire]] and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath;
see also to the careful packing of the presents [[present]] that the [[noble]] phaeacians
have made him; he will thus [[better]] enjoy both his supper and the singing
that will [[follow]]. i shall myself give him this golden goblet- which
is of exquisite workmanship- that he may be reminded of me for the
rest of his [[life]] whenever he makes a drink-offering to jove, or to
any of the gods." 

then arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the [[fire]] as fast
as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to
a clear [[fire]]; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water
became hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. meanwhile
arete brought a magnificent chest her own room, and inside it she
packed all the beautiful presents [[present]] of gold and raiment which the phaeacians
had brought. lastly she added a cloak and a [[good]] shirt from alcinous,
and said to [[ulysses]]: 

"see to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once,
for [[fear]] any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in
your ship." 

when [[ulysses]] heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast
with a bond that circe had taught him. he had done so before an upper
servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. he was very
glad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since
he left the house of calypso, who as long as he remained with her
had taken as [[good]] [[care]] of him as though he had been a [[god]]. when the
servants had done washing and anointing him with [[oil]], and had given
him a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the
guests who were sitting over their wine. lovely nausicaa stood by
one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof if the cloister, and
admired him as she saw him pass. "farewell stranger," said she, "do
not forget me when you are safe at [[home]] again, for it is to me first
that you owe a ransom for having saved your [[life]]." 

and [[ulysses]] said, "nausicaa, [[daughter]] of [[great]] alcinous, may jove
the mighty husband of juno, grant that i may reach my [[home]]; so shall
i bless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved
me." 

when he had said this, he seated himself beside alcinous. supper was
then served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. a servant [[led]] in
the favourite bard demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company,
near one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might
lean against it. then [[ulysses]] cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty
of fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant,
"take this piece of pork over to demodocus and tell him to [[eat]] it;
for all the [[pain]] his lays may cause me i will salute him none the
less; bards are honoured and respected throughout the [[world]], for the
muse teaches [[teach]] them their songs [[song]] and loves [[love]] them." 

the servant carried the pork in his fingers over to demodocus, who
took it and was very much pleased. they then laid their hands on the
good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had to
eat and drink, [[ulysses]] said to demodocus, "demodocus, there is no
one in the [[world]] whom i [[admire]] more than i do you. you must have studied
under the muse, jove's [[daughter]], and under [[apollo]], so accurately do
you sing the return of the achaeans with all their sufferings and
adventures. if you were not there yourself, you must have heard it
all from some one who was. now, however, [[change]] your [[song]] and tell
us of the wooden horse which epeus made with the assistance of minerva,
and which [[ulysses]] got by stratagem into the fort of troy after freighting
it with the [[men]] who afterwards sacked the [[city]]. if you will sing this
tale aright i will tell all the [[world]] how magnificently [[heaven]] has
endowed you." 

the bard inspired of [[heaven]] took up the story at the point where some
of the argives set [[fire]] to their tents and sailed away while others,
hidden within the horse, were waiting with [[ulysses]] in the trojan place
of assembly. for the trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their
fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it, and
were in three minds [[mind]] as to what they should do. some were for breaking
it up then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the
rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice;
while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation
for the gods. and this was how they settled it in the end, for the
city was doomed when it took in that horse, within which were all
the bravest of the argives waiting to bring [[death]] and destruction
on the trojans. anon he sang how the sons [[son]] of the achaeans issued from
the horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their ambuscade.
he sang how they over ran the [[city]] hither and thither and ravaged
it, and how [[ulysses]] went raging like [[mars]] along with menelaus to the
house of deiphobus. it was there that the [[fight]] raged most furiously,
nevertheless by minerva's [[help]] he was victorious. 

all this he told, but [[ulysses]] was overcome as he heard him, and his
cheeks were wet with tears. he wept as a woman weeps when she throws
herself on the [[body]] of her husband who has fallen before his own city
and [[people]], fighting bravely in defence of his [[home]] and [[children]].
she screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies [[lie]] gasping
for breath and dying, but her enemies [[enemy]] beat her from behind about the
back and shoulders, and carry her off into [[slavery]], to a [[life]] of labour
and [[sorrow]], and the [[beauty]] fades from her cheeks- even so piteously
did [[ulysses]] weep, but none of those [[present]] perceived his tears except
alcinous, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs
that he was heaving. the [[king]], therefore, at once rose and said:

"aldermen and town councillors of the phaeacians, let demodocus cease
his [[song]], for there are those [[present]] who do not seem to like it.
from the moment that we had done supper and demodocus began to sing,
our guest has been all the [[time]] groaning and lamenting. he is evidently
in [[great]] trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy
ourselves, hosts and guest alike. this will be much more as it should
be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents [[present]] that
we are making with so much [[good]] will, are wholly in his [[honour]], and
any one with even a moderate amount of [[right]] feeling knows [[know]] that he
ought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own [[brother]].

"therefore, sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor
reserve in the matter about which i shall ask you; it will be more
polite in you to give me a plain [[answer]]; tell me the name by which
your [[father]] and [[mother]] over yonder used to call you, and by which
you were known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. there is
no one, neither [[rich]] nor [[poor]], who is absolutely without any name
whatever, for people's fathers [[father]] and mothers [[mother]] give them names as soon
as they are born. tell me also your [[country]], nation, and [[city]], that
our ships may shape their [[purpose]] accordingly and take you there.
for the phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as
those of other nations have, but the ships themselves [[understand]] what
it is that we are thinking about and want; they [[know]] all the cities
and countries [[country]] in the whole [[world]], and can traverse the sea just as
well even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that there is
no danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm. still i do remember
hearing my [[father]] say that [[neptune]] was angry with us for being too
easy-going in the matter of giving [[people]] escorts. he said that one
of these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from
having escorted some one, and bury our [[city]] under a high mountain.
this is what my used to say, but whether the [[god]] will carry out his
threat or no is a matter which he will decide for himself.

"and now, tell me and tell me true. where have you been wandering,
and in what countries [[country]] have you travelled? tell us of the peoples [[people]] themselves,
and of their cities- who were hostile, savage and uncivilized, and
who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. tell us also why you
are made unhappy on hearing about the return of the argive danaans
from troy. the gods arranged all this, and sent them their misfortunes
in order that future generations [[generation]] might have something to sing about.
did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife's when you were before
troy? a son-in-law or father-in-law- which are the nearest relations
a [[man]] has outside his own flesh and [[blood]]? or was it some brave and
kindly-natured comrade- for a [[good]] friend is as dear to a [[man]] as his
own [[brother]]?" 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book ix

and [[ulysses]] answered, "king alcinous, it is a [[good]] thing to hear
a bard with such a [[divine]] voice as this [[man]] has. there is nothing
better or more delightful than when a whole [[people]] make merry together,
with the guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded
with bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his
cup for every [[man]]. this is indeed as [[fair]] a sight as a [[man]] can see.
now, however, since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows [[sorrow]],
and rekindle my own [[sad]] memories in [[respect]] of them, i do not know
how to begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the
hand of [[heaven]] has been laid heavily upon me. 

"firstly, then, i will tell you my name that you too may [[know]] it,
and one day, if i outlive this [[time]] of [[sorrow]], may become my there
guests though i [[live]] so far away from all of you. i am [[ulysses]] son
of laertes, reknowned among [[mankind]] for all manner of subtlety, so
that my fame ascends to [[heaven]]. i [[live]] in ithaca, where there is a
high mountain called neritum, covered with forests; and not far from
it there is a group of islands very near to one another- dulichium,
same, and the wooded island of zacynthus. it lies [[lie]] squat on the horizon,
all highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie
away from it towards dawn. it is a rugged island, but it breeds brave
men, and my [[eyes]] [[know]] none that they [[better]] [[love]] to look upon. the
goddess calypso kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me to marry
her, as did also the cunning aeaean [[goddess]] circe; but they could
neither of them persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man
than his own [[country]] and his parents, and however splendid a home
he may have in a [[foreign]] [[country]], if it be far from [[father]] or [[mother]],
he does not [[care]] about it. now, however, i will tell you of the many
hazardous adventures which by jove's will i met with on my return
from troy. 

"when i had set sail thence the wind took me first to ismarus, which
is the [[city]] of the cicons. there i sacked the town and put the people
to the [[sword]]. we took their wives [[wife]] and also much booty, which we divided
equitably amongst us, so that none might have [[reason]] to [[complain]].
i then said that we had [[better]] make off at once, but my [[men]] very foolishly
would not obey me, so they stayed there drinking much wine and killing
great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. meanwhile the cicons
cried out for [[help]] to other cicons who lived inland. these were more
in number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art [[arts]] of
war, for they could [[fight]], either from chariots or on foot as the
occasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as
leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand of [[heaven]] was against us,
so that we were hard pressed. they set the [[battle]] in array near the
ships, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another.
so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, we held our own
against them, though they were more in number than we; but as the
sun went down, towards the [[time]] when [[men]] loose their oxen, the cicons
got the [[better]] of us, and we lost half a dozen [[men]] from every ship
we had; so we got away with those that were left. 

"thence we sailed onward with [[sorrow]] in our hearts [[heart]], but glad to have
escaped [[death]] though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till
we had thrice invoked each one of the [[poor]] fellows who had perished
by the hands of the cicons. then jove raised the north wind against
us till it blew a hurricane, so that [[land]] and [[sky]] were hidden in thick
clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens [[heaven]]. we let the ships
run before the gale, but the [[force]] of the wind tore our sails to tatters,
so we took them down for [[fear]] of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest
towards the [[land]]. there we lay two days and two nights suffering much
alike from toil and distress of [[mind]], but on the morning of the third
day we again raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting
the wind and steersmen direct our ship. i should have got [[home]] at
that [[time]] unharmed had not the north wind and the currents been against
me as i was doubling cape malea, and set me off my course hard by
the island of cythera. 

"i was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the
sea, but on the tenth day we reached the [[land]] of the lotus-eater,
who [[live]] on a food that comes from a [[kind]] of flower. here we landed
to take in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the
shore near the ships. when they had eaten and drunk i sent two of
my company to see what manner of [[men]] the [[people]] of the place might
be, and they had a third [[man]] under them. they started at once, and
went about among the lotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave
them to [[eat]] of the lotus, which was so delicious that those who ate
of it left off caring about [[home]], and did not even want to go back
and say what had happened to them, but were for staying and munching
lotus with the lotus-eater without thinking further of their return;
nevertheless, though they wept bitterly i forced them back to the
ships and made them fast under the benches. then i told the rest to
go on board at once, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and
leave off wanting to get [[home]], so they took their places and smote
the grey sea with their oars. 

"we sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the land
of the lawless and inhuman cyclopes. now the cyclopes neither plant
nor plough, but trust in providence, and [[live]] on such wheat, barley,
and grapes as grow wild without any [[kind]] of tillage, and their wild
grapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. they
have no laws [[law]] nor assemblies of the [[people]], but [[live]] in caves on the
tops of high mountains; each is [[lord]] and master in his [[family]], and
they take no account of their neighbours. 

"now off their harbour there lies [[lie]] a wooded and fertile island not
quite close to the [[land]] of the cyclopes, but still not far. it is
overrun with wild goats, that breed there in [[great]] numbers and are
never disturbed by foot of [[man]]; for sportsmen- who as a [[rule]] will
suffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices- do
not go there, nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it
lies a wilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no
living thing upon it but only goats. for the cyclopes have no ships,
nor yet shipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot therefore
go from [[city]] to [[city]], or sail over the sea to one another's country
as [[people]] who have ships can do; if they had had these they would
have colonized the island, for it is a very [[good]] one, and would yield
everything in due season. there are meadows that in some places come
right down to the sea shore, well watered and full of luscious grass;
grapes would do there excellently; there is level [[land]] for ploughing,
and it would always yield heavily at harvest [[time]], for the soil is
deep. there is a [[good]] harbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet
anchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has to do is to beach
one's vessel and stay there till the wind becomes [[fair]] for putting
out to sea again. at the head of the harbour there is a spring of
clear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplars growing all
round it. 

"here we entered, but so dark was the night that some [[god]] must have
brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. a thick
mist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass of
clouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked
for it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore
before we found ourselves upon the [[land]] itself; when, however, we
had beached the ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped
upon the beach till daybreak. 

"when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, we admired
the island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs [[nymph]] jove's daughters
roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner.
on this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships,
and dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats.
heaven sent us excellent [[sport]]; i had twelve ships with me, and each
ship got nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong
day to the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill,- and we
had plenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full
when we sacked the [[city]] of the cicons, and this had not yet run out.
while we were feasting we kept turning our [[eyes]] towards the [[land]] of
the cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble
fires. we could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating
of their sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on
dark, we camped down upon the beach, and next morning i called a council.

"'stay here, my brave fellows,' said i, 'all the rest of you, while
i go with my ship and exploit these [[people]] myself: i want to see if
they are uncivilized savages, or a hospitable and humane [[race]].'

"i went on board, bidding my [[men]] to do so also and loose the hawsers;
so they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.
when we got to the [[land]], which was not far, there, on the face of
a cliff near the sea, we saw a [[great]] cave overhung with laurels. it
was a station for a [[great]] many sheep and goats, and outside there
was a large yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built into
the ground and of trees both pine and oak. this was the abode of a
huge monster who was then away from [[home]] shepherding his flocks. he
would have nothing to do with other [[people]], but [[led]] the [[life]] of an
outlaw. he was a horrid creature, not like a [[human]] being at all, but
resembling rather some crag that stands out boldly against the sky
on the top of a high mountain. 

"i told my [[men]] to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were,
all but the twelve [[best]] among them, who were to go along with myself.
i also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me
by maron, [[apollo]] [[son]] of euanthes, who was [[priest]] of [[apollo]] the patron
god of ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple.
when we were sacking the [[city]] we respected him, and spared his [[life]],
as also his [[wife]] and child; so he made me some presents [[present]] of [[great]] value-
seven [[talents]] of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars
of sweet wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavour. not a
man nor maid in the house knew about it, but only himself, his [[wife]],
and one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water
to one of wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was so
exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from drinking. i filled
a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet full of provisions
with me, for my [[mind]] misgave me that i might have to deal with some
savage who would be of [[great]] [[strength]], and would [[respect]] neither right
nor [[law]]. 

"we soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went
inside and took stock of all that we could see. his cheese-racks were
loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens
could hold. they were kept in separate flocks; first there were the
hoggets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very
young ones all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all
the vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which he milked, were swimming
with whey. when they saw all this, my [[men]] begged me to let them first
steal some cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; they would
then return, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and
sail away with them. it would have been indeed [[better]] if we had done
so but i would not listen to them, for i wanted to see the owner himself,
in the [[hope]] that he might give me a [[present]]. when, however, we saw
him my [[poor]] [[men]] found him ill to deal with. 

"we lit a [[fire]], offered some of the cheeses in [[sacrifice]], ate others
of them, and then sat waiting till the cyclops should come in with
his sheep. when he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry
firewood to [[light]] the [[fire]] for his supper, and this he flung with
such a noise on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for
fear at the far end of the cavern. meanwhile he drove all the ewes
inside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk, leaving
the males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. then he rolled
a huge stone to the mouth of the cave- so huge that two and twenty
strong four-wheeled waggons would not be enough to draw it from its
place against the doorway. when he had so done he sat down and milked
his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of them have
her own [[young]]. he curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker
strainers, but the other half he poured into bowls that he might drink
it for his supper. when he had got through with all his [[work]], he lit
the [[fire]], and then caught sight of us, whereon he said: 

"'strangers, who are you? where do sail from? are you traders, or
do you sail the as rovers, with your hands against every [[man]], and
every man's [[man]] hand against you?' 

"we were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous
form, but i managed to say, 'we are achaeans on our way [[home]] from
troy, but by the will of jove, and stress of weather, we have been
driven far out of our course. we are the [[people]] of [[agamemnon]], son
of atreus, who has won infinite renown throughout the whole [[world]],
by sacking so [[great]] a [[city]] and killing so many [[people]]. we therefore
humbly [[pray]] you to show us some hospitality, and otherwise make us
such presents [[present]] as visitors may reasonably expect. may your excellency
fear the wrath of [[heaven]], for we are your suppliants, and jove takes
all respectable travellers under his protection, for he is the avenger
of all suppliants and foreigners in distress.' 

"to this he gave me but a pitiless [[answer]], 'stranger,' said he, 'you
are a [[fool]], or else you [[know]] nothing of this [[country]]. talk to me,
indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? we cyclopes
do not [[care]] about jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever
so much stronger than they. i shall not spare either yourself or your
companions out of any regard for jove, unless i am in the [[humour]] for
doing so. and now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came
on shore. was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the
land?' 

"he said this to draw me out, but i was too cunning to be caught in
that way, so i answered with a [[lie]]; 'neptune,' said i, 'sent my ship
on to the rocks at the far end of your [[country]], and wrecked it. we
were driven on to them from the open sea, but i and those who are
with me escaped the jaws of [[death]].' 

"the cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of [[answer]], but with a
sudden clutch he gripped up two of my [[men]] at once and dashed them
down upon the ground as though they had been puppies. their brains
were shed upon the ground, and the [[earth]] was wet with their [[blood]].
then he tore them limb from limb and supped upon them. he gobbled
them up like a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails,
without leaving anything uneaten. as for us, we wept and lifted up
our hands to [[heaven]] on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not
know what else to do; but when the cyclops had filled his huge paunch,
and had washed down his meal of [[human]] flesh with a drink of neat milk,
he stretched himself full length upon the ground among his sheep,
and went to sleep. i was at first inclined to seize my [[sword]], draw
it, and drive it into his vitals, but i reflected that if i did we
should all certainly be lost, for we should never be able to shift
the stone which the monster had put in front of the door. so we stayed
sobbing and sighing where we were till morning came. 

"when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he again
lit his [[fire]], milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then
let each have her own [[young]] one; as soon as he had got through with
all his [[work]], he clutched up two more of my [[men]], and began eating
them for his morning's meal. presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled
the stone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once
put it back again- as easily as though he were merely clapping the
lid on to a quiver full of arrows. as soon as he had done so he shouted,
and cried 'shoo, shoo,' after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain;
so i was left to scheme some way of taking my [[revenge]] and covering
myself with [[glory]]. 

"in the end i deemed it would be the [[best]] plan to do as follows. the
cyclops had a [[great]] club which was lying near one of the sheep pens;
it was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it
for a staff as soon as it should be dry. it was so huge that we could
only compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large
burden, and able to venture out into open sea. i went up to this club
and cut off about six feet of it; i then gave this piece to the men
and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded
to do, and lastly i brought it to a point myself, charring the end
in the [[fire]] to make it harder. when i had done this i hid it under
dung, which was lying about all over the cave, and told the [[men]] to
cast lots which of them should venture along with myself to lift it
and bore it into the monster's eye while he was asleep. the lot fell
upon the very four whom i should have chosen, and i myself made five.
in the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and drove his
flocks into the cave- this [[time]] driving them all inside, and not leaving
any in the yards; i suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god
must have prompted him to do so. as soon as he had put the stone back
to its place against the door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his
goats all quite rightly, and then let each have her own [[young]] one;
when he had got through with all this [[work]], he gripped up two more
of my [[men]], and made his supper off them. so i went up to him with
an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands: 

"'look here, cyclops,' said i, you have been eating a [[great]] deal of
man's flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what
kind of liquor we had on board my ship. i was bringing it to you as
a drink-offering, in the [[hope]] that you would take compassion upon
me and further me on my way [[home]], whereas all you do is to go on ramping
and raving most intolerably. you ought to be ashamed yourself; how
can you expect [[people]] to come see you any more if you treat them in
this way?' 

"he then took the cup and drank. he was so delighted with the taste
of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'be so [[kind]],'
he said, 'as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once.
i want to make you a [[present]] that you will be glad to have. we have
wine even in this [[country]], for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens
them, but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.'

"i then gave him some more; three times [[time]] did i fill the bowl for him,
and three times [[time]] did he drain it without [[thought]] or heed; then, when
i saw that the wine had got into his head, i said to him as plausibly
as i could: 'cyclops, you ask my name and i will tell it you; give
me, therefore, the [[present]] you promised me; my name is noman; this
is what my [[father]] and [[mother]] and my [[friends]] have always called me.'

"but the cruel wretch said, 'then i will [[eat]] all noman's comrades
before noman himself, and will keep noman for the [[last]]. this is the
present that i will make him.' 

as he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.
his [[great]] neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon
him. presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets
of [[human]] flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk.
then i thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and
encouraged my [[men]] lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. when
the wood, green though it was, was about to blaze, i drew it out of
the [[fire]] glowing with heat, and my [[men]] gathered round me, for heaven
had filled their hearts [[heart]] with [[courage]]. we drove the sharp end of the
beam into the monster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight
i kept turning it round and round as though i were boring a hole in
a ship's plank with an auger, which two [[men]] with a wheel and strap
can keep on turning as long as they choose. even thus did we bore
the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling [[blood]] bubbled all
over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from the
burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of
the eye sputtered in the [[fire]]. as a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet
into cold water to temper it- for it is this that gives [[strength]] to
the iron- and it makes a [[great]] hiss as he does so, even thus did the
cyclops' eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells
made the cave ring again. we ran away in a fright, but he plucked
the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, and hurled it from
him in a frenzy of rage and [[pain]], shouting as he did so to the other
cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they gathered
from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and asked
what was the matter with him. 

"'what ails you, polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such a noise,
breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being
able to sleep? surely no [[man]] is carrying off your sheep? surely no
man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by [[force]]? 

"but polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, 'noman is killing
me by fraud! noman is killing me by force!' 

"'then,' said they, 'if no [[man]] is attacking you, you must be ill;
when jove makes [[people]] ill, there is no [[help]] for it, and you had better
pray to your [[father]] [[neptune]].' 

"then they went away, and i laughed inwardly at the [[success]] of my
clever stratagem, but the cyclops, groaning and in an agony of [[pain]],
felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from
the door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front
of it to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he [[thought]] i might
be foolish enough to attempt this. 

"as for myself i kept on puzzling to [[think]] how i could [[best]] save my
own [[life]] and those of my companions; i schemed and schemed, as one
who knows [[know]] that his [[life]] depends upon it, for the danger was very [[great]].
in the end i deemed that this plan would be the [[best]]. the male sheep
were well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so i bound them
noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which
the wicked monster used to sleep. there was to be a [[man]] under the
middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that
there were three sheep to each [[man]]. as for myself there was a ram
finer than any of the others, so i caught hold of him by the back,
esconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and flung on patiently
to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all the [[time]].

"thus, then, did we wait in [[great]] [[fear]] of [[mind]] till morning came,
but when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, the male
sheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about
the pens waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting;
but their master in spite of all his [[pain]] [[felt]] the backs of all the
sheep as they stood upright, without being sharp enough to find out
that the [[men]] were underneath their bellies. as the ram was going out,
last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty
self; polyphemus laid hold of it and said: 

"'my [[good]] ram, what is it that makes you the [[last]] to leave my cave
this morning? you are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but
lead the mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain,
and are the first to come [[home]] again at night; but now you lag last
of all. is it because you [[know]] your master has lost his eye, and are
sorry because that wicked noman and his horrid crew have got him down
in his drink and blinded him? but i will have his [[life]] yet. if you
could [[understand]] and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding,
and i would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all over
the cave. i should thus have some satisfaction for the harm a this
no-good noman has done me.' 

"as spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way
out from the cave and yards, i first got from under the ram's belly,
and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat,
by constantly heading them in the [[right]] direction we managed to drive
them down to the ship. the crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of
us who had escaped [[death]], but wept for the others whom the cyclops
had killed. however, i made signs to them by nodding and frowning
that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the
sheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took
their places, and smote the grey sea with their oars. then, when i
had got as far out as my voice would reach, i began to jeer at the
cyclops. 

"'cyclops,' said i, 'you should have taken [[better]] measure of your
man before eating up his comrades in your cave. you wretch, [[eat]] up
your visitors in your own house? you might have known that your sin
would find you out, and now jove and the other gods have punished
you.' 

"he got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from
off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that
it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. the sea quaked
as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried
us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. but
i snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my
men by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives [[life]], whereon
they laid out with a will. when we had got twice as far as we were
before, i was for jeering at the cyclops again, but the [[men]] begged
and prayed of me to hold my tongue. 

"'do not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough to provoke this savage creature
further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back
again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the [[death]] of us;
if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have pounded
our heads and our ship's timbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks
he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.'

"but i would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage,
'cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and
spoiled your [[beauty]], say it was the valiant warrior [[ulysses]], [[son]] of
laertes, who lives [[life]] in ithaca.' 

"on this he groaned, and cried out, 'alas, alas, then the old prophecy
about me is coming true. there was a [[prophet]] here, at one [[time]], a
man both brave and of [[great]] stature, telemus [[son]] of eurymus, who was
an excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the cyclopes till
he grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day,
and said i should lose my sight by the hand of [[ulysses]]. i have been
all along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman [[strength]],
whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant weakling, who has
managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come
here, then, [[ulysses]], that i may make you presents [[present]] to show my hospitality,
and urge [[neptune]] to [[help]] you forward on your journey- for neptune
and i are [[father]] and [[son]]. he, if he so will, shall heal me, which
no one else neither [[god]] nor [[man]] can do.' 

"then i said, 'i [[wish]] i could be as sure of killing you outright and
sending you down to the house of [[hades]], as i am that it will take
more than [[neptune]] to cure that eye of yours.' 

"on this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of [[heaven]] and prayed,
saying, 'hear me, [[great]] [[neptune]]; if i am indeed your own true-begotten
son, grant that [[ulysses]] may never reach his [[home]] alive; or if he must
get back to his [[friends]] at [[last]], let him do so late and in sore plight
after losing all his [[men]] [let him reach his [[home]] in another man's
ship and find trouble in his house.'] 

"thus did he [[pray]], and [[neptune]] heard his prayer. then he picked up
a rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with
prodigious [[force]]. it fell just short of the ship, but was within a
little of hitting the end of the rudder. the sea quaked as the rock
fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards
on our way towards the shore of the island. 

"when at [[last]] we got to the island where we had left the rest of our
ships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting
our return. we ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on
to the sea shore; we also landed the cyclops' sheep, and divided them
equitably amongst us so that none might have [[reason]] to [[complain]]. as
for the ram, my companions agreed that i should have it as an extra
share; so i sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones
to jove, who is the [[lord]] of all. but he heeded not my [[sacrifice]], and
only [[thought]] how he might [[destroy]] my ships and my comrades.

"thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted
our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came
on dark, we camped upon the beach. when the child of morning, rosy-fingered
dawn, appeared, i bade my [[men]] on board and loose the hawsers. then
they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; so
we sailed on with [[sorrow]] in our hearts [[heart]], but glad to have escaped death
though we had lost our comrades.

book x

thence we went on to the aeoli island where lives [[life]] aeolus [[son]] of hippotas,
dear to the [[immortal]] gods. it is an island that floats (as it were)
upon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. now, aeolus has
six daughters [[daughter]] and six lusty sons [[son]], so he made the sons [[son]] [[marry]] the daughters [[daughter]],
and they all [[live]] with their dear [[father]] and [[mother]], feasting and
enjoying every conceivable [[kind]] of luxury. all day long the atmosphere
of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats till it groans
again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well-made bedsteads,
each with his own [[wife]] between the blankets. these were the people
among whom we had now come. 

"aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions [[question]] all the
time about troy, the argive fleet, and the return of the achaeans.
i told him exactly how everything had happened, and when i said i
must go, and [[asked]] him to further me on my way, he made no sort of
difficulty, but set about doing so at once. moreover, he flayed me
a prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut
up in the hide as in a sack- for jove had made him captain over the
winds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his
own [[pleasure]]. he put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly
with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow
from any quarter. the west wind which was [[fair]] for us did he alone
let blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we were lost
through our own folly. 

"nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native
land showed on the horizon. we got so close in that we could see the
stubble fires [[fire]] burning, and i, being then [[dead]] beat, fell into a light
sleep, for i had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we
might get [[home]] the faster. on this the [[men]] fell to talking among themselves,
and said i was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that aeolus
had given me. 'bless my [[heart]],' would one turn to his neighbour, saying,
'how this [[man]] gets honoured and makes [[friends]] to whatever [[city]] or
country he may go. see what fine prizes he is taking [[home]] from troy,
while we, who have travelled just as far as he has, come back with
hands as empty as we set out with- and now aeolus has given him ever
so much more. quick- let us see what it all is, and how much gold
and silver there is in the sack he gave him.' 

"thus they talked and [[evil]] counsels prevailed. they loosed the sack,
whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried
us weeping out to sea and away from our own [[country]]. then i awoke,
and knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to [[live]] on and
make the [[best]] of it; but i bore it, covered myself up, and lay down
in the ship, while the [[men]] lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore
our fleet back to the aeolian island. 

"when we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard
by the ships. immediately after dinner i took a herald and one of
my [[men]] and went straight to the house of aeolus, where i found him
feasting with his [[wife]] and [[family]]; so we sat down as suppliants on
the threshold. they were astounded when they saw us and said, 'ulysses,
what brings you here? what [[god]] has been ill-treating you? we took
great pains [[pain]] to further you on your way [[home]] to ithaca, or wherever
it was that you wanted to go to.' 

"thus did they speak, but i answered sorrowfully, 'my [[men]] have undone
me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. my [[friends]], mend me this
mischief, for you can if you will.' 

"i spoke as movingly as i could, but they said nothing, till their
father answered, 'vilest of [[mankind]], get you gone at once out of the
island; him whom [[heaven]] hates will i in no [[wise]] [[help]]. be off, for
you come here as one abhorred of [[heaven]]. "and with these words he
sent me sorrowing from his door. 

"thence we sailed sadly on till the [[men]] were worn out with long and
fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to [[help]] them. six
days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached
the rocky stronghold of lamus- telepylus, the [[city]] of the laestrygonians,
where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked]
salutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this [[last]] answers
the salute. in that [[country]] a [[man]] who could do without sleep might
earn double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd,
for they [[work]] much the same by night as they do by day. 

"when we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep cliffs,
with a narrow entrance between two headlands. my captains took all
their ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for there
was never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead
calm. i kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the very
end of the point; then i climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but could
see no sign neither of [[man]] nor cattle, only some smoke rising from
the ground. so i sent two of my company with an attendant to find
out what sort of [[people]] the inhabitants were. 

"the [[men]] when they got on shore followed a level road by which the
people draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till
presently they met a [[young]] woman who had come outside to fetch water,
and who was [[daughter]] to a laestrygonian named antiphates. she was
going to the fountain artacia from which the [[people]] bring in their
water, and when my [[men]] had come close up to her, they [[asked]] her who
the [[king]] of that [[country]] might be, and over what [[kind]] of [[people]] he
ruled; so she directed them to her father's house, but when they got
there they found his [[wife]] to be a giantess as huge as a mountain,
and they were horrified at the sight of her. 

"she at once called her husband antiphates from the place of assembly,
and forthwith he set about killing my [[men]]. he snatched up one of them,
and began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other
two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. but antiphates
raised a hue and cry after them, and thousands of sturdy laestrygonians
sprang up from every quarter- ogres, not [[men]]. they threw vast rocks
at us from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and i heard
the horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and
the [[death]] cries of my [[men]], as the laestrygonians speared them like
fishes and took them [[home]] to [[eat]] them. while they were thus killing
my [[men]] within the harbour i drew my [[sword]], cut the cable of my own
ship, and told my [[men]] to row with alf their might if they too would
not fare like the rest; so they laid out for their lives [[life]], and we were
thankful enough when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks
they hurled at us. as for the others there was not one of them left.

"thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped [[death]], though we
had lost our comrades, and came to the aeaean island, where circe
lives a [[great]] and cunning [[goddess]] who is own sister to the magician
aeetes- for they are both [[children]] of the sun by perse, who is daughter
to oceanus. we brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word,
for some [[god]] guided us thither, and having landed we there for two
days and two nights, worn out in [[body]] and [[mind]]. when the morning of
the third day came i took my spear and my [[sword]], and went away from
the ship to reconnoitre, and see if i could discover signs of human
handiwork, or hear the sound of voices. climbing to the top of a high
look-out i espied the smoke of circe's house rising upwards amid a
dense forest of trees, and when i saw this i doubted whether, having
seen the smoke, i would not go on at once and find out more, but in
the end i deemed it [[best]] to go back to the ship, give the [[men]] their
dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself. 

"when i had nearly got back to the ship some [[god]] took [[pity]] upon my
solitude, and sent a fine antlered stag [[right]] into the middle of my
path. he was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the
river, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed i struck
him in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went
clean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life
went out of him. then i set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the
wound, and laid it down; i also gathered rough grass and rushes and
twisted them into a fathom or so of [[good]] stout rope, with which i
bound the four feet of the [[noble]] creature together; having so done
i hung him round my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon
my spear, for the stag was much too big for me to be able to carry
him on my shoulder, steadying him with one hand. as i threw him down
in front of the ship, i called the [[men]] and spoke cheeringly [[man]] by
man to each of them. 'look here my [[friends]],' said i, 'we are not going
to [[die]] so much before our [[time]] after all, and at any rate we will
not starve so long as we have got something to [[eat]] and drink on board.'
on this they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired
the stag, for he was indeed a splendid fellow. then, when they had
feasted their [[eyes]] upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands
and began to cook him for dinner. 

"thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed
there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and
it came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. when the child of morning,
fingered dawn, appeared, i called a council and said, 'my [[friends]],
we are in very [[great]] difficulties; listen therefore to me. we have
no [[idea]] where the sun either sets or rises, so that we do not even
know east from west. i see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must
try and find one. we are certainly on an island, for i went as high
as i could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to
the horizon; it lies [[lie]] low, but towards the middle i saw smoke rising
from out of a thick forest of trees.' 

"their hearts [[heart]] sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they
had been treated by the laestrygonian antiphates, and by the savage
ogre polyphemus. they wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was
nothing to be got by crying, so i divided them into two companies
and set a captain over each; i gave one company to eurylochus, while
i took command of the other myself. then we cast lots in a helmet,
and the lot fell upon eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two
men, and they wept, as also did we who were left behind.

"when they reached circe's house they found it built of cut stones,
on a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest.
there were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it- poor
bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged
into subjection. they did not attack my [[men]], but wagged their great
tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them.
as hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming from dinner-
for they [[know]] he will bring them something- even so did these wolves
and lions with their [[great]] claws fawn upon my [[men]], but the [[men]] were
terribly frightened at seeing such [[strange]] creatures. presently they
reached the gates of the goddess's house, and as they stood there
they could hear circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked
at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours
as no one but a [[goddess]] could weave. on this polites, whom i valued
and trusted more than any other of my [[men]], said, 'there is some one
inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place
resounds with it, let us call her and see whether she is woman or
goddess.' 

"they called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade
them enter. they, thinking no [[evil]], followed her, all except eurylochus,
who suspected mischief and stayed outside. when she had got them into
her house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess
with cheese, honey, meal, and pramnian but she drugged it with wicked
poisons to make them forget their homes [[home]], and when they had drunk she
turned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in
her pigsties. they were like pigs-head, hair, and all, and they grunted
just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they
remembered everything. 

"thus then were they shut up squealing, and circe threw them some
acorns and beech masts such as pigs [[eat]], but eurylochus hurried back
to tell me about the [[sad]] [[fate]] of our comrades. he was so overcome
with dismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to
do so; his [[eyes]] filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh,
till at [[last]] we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had
happened to the others. 

"'we went,' said he, as you told us, through the forest, and in the
middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place
that could be seen from far. there we found a woman, or else she was
a [[goddess]], working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the [[men]] shouted
to her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door,
and invited us in. the others did not suspect any mischief so they
followed her into the house, but i stayed where i was, for i thought
there might be some treachery. from that moment i saw them no more,
for not one of them ever came out, though i sat a long [[time]] watching
for them.' 

"then i took my [[sword]] of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; i
also took my bow, and told eurylochus to come back with me and show
me the way. but he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously,
saying, 'sir, do not [[force]] me to go with you, but let me stay here,
for i [[know]] you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even
return alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any
rate with the few that are left us, for we may still save our lives [[life]].'

"'stay where you are, then, 'answered i, 'eating and drinking at the
ship, but i must go, for i am most urgently bound to do so.'

"with this i left the ship and went up inland. when i got through
the charmed grove, and was near the [[great]] house of the enchantress
circe, i met mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a [[young]] man
in the hey-day of his [[youth]] and [[beauty]] with the down just coming upon
his face. he came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying,
'my [[poor]] unhappy [[man]], whither are you going over this mountain top,
alone and without knowing the way? your [[men]] are shut up in circe's
pigsties, like so many wild boars in their lairs. you surely do not
fancy that you can set them [[free]]? i can tell you that you will never
get back and will have to stay there with the rest of them. but never
mind, i will [[protect]] you and get you out of your difficulty. take
this herb, which is one of [[great]] [[virtue]], and keep it about you when
you go to circe's house, it will be a talisman to you against every
kind of mischief. 

"'and i will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that circe will
try to practise upon you. she will mix a mess for you to drink, and
she will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be
able to charm you, for the [[virtue]] of the herb that i shall give you
will prevent her spells from working. i will tell you all about it.
when circe strikes you with her wand, draw your [[sword]] and spring upon
her as though you were goings to kill her. she will then be frightened
and will [[desire]] you to go to bed with her; on this you must not point
blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions [[free]], and
to take [[good]] [[care]] also of yourself, but you make her swear solemnly
by all the blessed that she will plot no further mischief against
you, or else when she has got you naked she will unman you and make
you fit for nothing.' 

"as he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground an showed me what
it was like. the root was black, while the flower was as [[white]] as
milk; the gods call it moly, and mortal [[men]] cannot uproot it, but
the gods can do whatever they like. 

"then mercury went back to high [[olympus]] passing over the wooded island;
but i fared onward to the house of circe, and my [[heart]] was clouded
with [[care]] as i walked along. when i got to the gates i stood there
and called the [[goddess]], and as soon as she heard me she came down,
opened the door, and [[asked]] me to come in; so i followed her- much
troubled in my [[mind]]. she set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid
with silver, there was a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed
a mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it, for
she meant me mischief. when she had given it me, and i had drunk it
without its charming me, she struck she, struck me with her wand.
'there now,' she cried, 'be off to the pigsty, and make your lair
with the rest of them.' 

"but i rushed at her with my [[sword]] drawn as though i would kill her,
whereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke piteously,
saying, 'who and whence are you? from what place and [[people]] have you
come? how can it be that my drugs have no [[power]] to charm you? never
yet was any [[man]] able to stand so much as a taste of the herb i gave
you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than the
bold hero [[ulysses]], who mercury always said would come here some day
with his ship while on his way [[home]] form troy; so be it then; sheathe
your [[sword]] and let us go to bed, that we may make [[friends]] and learn
to trust each other.' 

"and i answered, 'circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with
you when you have just been turning all my [[men]] into pigs? and now
that you have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask
me to go to bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing.
i shall certainly not [[consent]] to go to bed with you unless you will
first take your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.'

"so she swore at once as i had told her, and when she had completed
her oath then i went to bed with her. 

"meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their
work. they are the [[children]] of the groves and fountains, and of the
holy waters that run down into the sea. one of them spread a fair
purple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. another
brought tables of silver up to the seats, and set them with baskets
of gold. a third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl
and put golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth she brought
in water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over a [[good]] [[fire]] which
she had lighted. when the water in the cauldron was boiling, she poured
cold into it till it was just as i liked it, and then she set me in
a bath and began washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders,
to take the tire and stiffness out of my limbs. as soon as she had
done washing me and anointing me with [[oil]], she arrayed me in a good
cloak and shirt and [[led]] me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with
silver; there was a footstool also under my feet. a maid servant then
brought me water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver
basin for me to wash my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me;
an upper servant brought me bread and offered me many things of what
there was in the house, and then circe bade me [[eat]], but i would not,
and sat without heeding what was before me, still moody and suspicious.

"when circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in [[great]] [[grief]],
she came to me and said, 'ulysses, why do you sit like that as though
you were dumb, gnawing at your own [[heart]], and refusing both meat and
drink? is it that you are still suspicious? you ought not to be, for
i have already sworn solemnly that i will not hurt you.'

"and i said, 'circe, no [[man]] with any sense of what is [[right]] can think
of either eating or drinking in your house until you have set his
friends [[free]] and let him see them. if you want me to [[eat]] and drink,
you must [[free]] my [[men]] and bring them to me that i may see them with
my own [[eyes]].' 

"when i had said this she went straight through the court with her
wand in her hand and opened the pigsty doors. my [[men]] came out like
so many prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among
them and anointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that
the [[bad]] drug had given them fell off, and they became [[men]] again, younger
than they were before, and much taller and [[better]] looking. they knew
me at once, seized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till
the whole house was filled with the sound of their hullabalooing,
and circe herself was so [[sorry]] for them that she came up to me and
said, 'ulysses, [[noble]] [[son]] of laertes, go back at once to the sea where
you have left your ship, and first draw it on to the [[land]]. then, hide
all your ship's gear and [[property]] in some cave, and come back here
with your [[men]].' 

"i agreed to this, so i went back to the sea shore, and found the
men at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. when they saw
me the silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves
break out and gambol round their mothers [[mother]], when they see them coming
home to be milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead
resounds with their lowing. they seemed as glad to see me as though
they had got back to their own rugged ithaca, where they had been
born and bred. 'sir,' said the affectionate creatures, 'we are as
glad to see you back as though we had got safe [[home]] to ithaca; but
tell us all about the [[fate]] of our comrades.' 

"i spoke comfortingly to them and said, 'we must draw our ship on
to the [[land]], and hide the ship's gear with all our [[property]] in some
cave; then come with me all of you as fast as you can to circe's house,
where you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst
of [[great]] abundance.' 

"on this the [[men]] would have come with me at once, but eurylochus tried
to hold them back and said, 'alas, [[poor]] wretches that we are, what
will become of us? rush not on your ruin by going to the house of
circe, who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall
have to keep guard over her house. [[remember]] how the cyclops treated
us when our comrades went inside his cave, and [[ulysses]] with them.
it was all through his sheer folly that those [[men]] lost their lives [[life]].'

"when i heard him i was in two minds [[mind]] whether or no to draw the keen
blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of
his being a near relation of my own; but the [[men]] interceded for him
and said, 'sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and mind
the ship, but take the rest of us with you to circe's house.'

"on this we all went inland, and eurylochus was not left behind after
all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand
that i had given him. 

"meanwhile circe had been seeing that the [[men]] who had been left behind
were washed and anointed with olive [[oil]]; she had also given them woollen
cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably
at dinner in her house. as soon as the [[men]] saw each other face to
face and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud till
the whole palace rang again. thereon circe came up to me and said,
'ulysses, [[noble]] [[son]] of laertes, tell your [[men]] to leave off crying;
i [[know]] how much you have all of you [[suffered]] at sea, and how ill you
have fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now,
so stay here, and [[eat]] and drink till you are once more as [[strong]] and
hearty as you were when you left ithaca; for at [[present]] you are weakened
both in [[body]] and [[mind]]; you keep all the [[time]] thinking of the hardships-
you have [[suffered]] during your travels, so that you have no more cheerfulness
left in you.' 

"thus did she speak and we assented. we stayed with circe for a whole
twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine.
but when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days
had come round, my [[men]] called me apart and said, 'sir, it is time
you began to [[think]] about going [[home]], if so be you are to be spared
to see your house and native [[country]] at all.' 

"thus did they speak and i assented. thereon through the livelong
day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine,
but when the sun went down and it came on dark the [[men]] laid themselves
down to sleep in the covered cloisters. i, however, after i had got
into bed with circe, besought her by her knees, and the [[goddess]] listened
to what i had got to say. 'circe,' said i, 'please to keep the promise
you made me about furthering me on my homeward [[voyage]]. i want to get
back and so do my [[men]], they are always pestering me with their complaints
as soon as ever your back is turned.' 

"and the [[goddess]] answered, 'ulysses, [[noble]] [[son]] of laertes, you shall
none of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there
is another [[journey]] which you have got to take before you can sail
homewards. you must go to the house of [[hades]] and of dread proserpine
to consult the ghost of the blind theban [[prophet]] teiresias whose reason
is still unshaken. to him alone has proserpine left his understanding
even in [[death]], but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.'

"i was dismayed when i heard this. i sat up in bed and wept, and would
gladly have lived no longer to see the [[light]] of the sun, but presently
when i was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, i said, 'and
who shall guide me upon this voyage- for the house of [[hades]] is a port
that no ship can reach.' 

"'you will want no guide,' she answered; 'raise you mast, set your
white sails, sit quite still, and the north wind will blow you there
of itself. when your ship has traversed the waters of oceanus, you
will reach the fertile shore of proserpine's [[country]] with its groves
of tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach
your ship upon the shore of oceanus, and go straight on to the dark
abode of [[hades]]. you will find it near the place where the rivers pyriphlegethon
and cocytus (which is a branch of the river styx) flow into acheron,
and you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers
run into one another. 

"'when you have reached this spot, as i now tell you, dig a trench
a cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a
drink-offering to all the [[dead]], first, honey mixed with milk, then
wine, and in the third place water-sprinkling [[white]] barley meal over
the whole. moreover you must offer many prayers to the [[poor]] feeble
ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to ithaca you will
sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the [[best]] you have, and will load
the pyre with [[good]] things. more particularly you must promise that
teiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all
your flocks. 

"'when you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers,
offer them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards erebus;
but yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards
the river. on this, many [[dead]] men's ghosts will come to you, and you
must tell your [[men]] to skin the two sheep that you have just killed,
and offer them as a burnt [[sacrifice]] with prayers to [[hades]] and to proserpine.
then draw your [[sword]] and sit there, so as to prevent any other poor
ghost from coming near the split [[blood]] before teiresias shall have
answered your questions [[question]]. the seer will presently come to you, and
will tell you about your voyage- what stages you are to make, and
how you are to sail the see so as to reach your [[home]].' 

"it was day-break by the [[time]] she had done speaking, so she dressed
me in my shirt and cloak. as for herself she threw a beautiful light
gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle
round her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. then i went
about among the [[men]] everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly
to each of them [[man]] by [[man]]: 'you must not [[lie]] sleeping here any longer,'
said i to them, 'we must be going, for circe has told me all about
it.' and this they did as i bade them. 

"even so, however, i did not get them away without misadventure. we
had with us a [[certain]] [[youth]] named elpenor, not very remarkable for
sense or [[courage]], who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top
away from the rest of the [[men]], to sleep off his liquor in the cool.
when he heard the noise of the [[men]] bustling about, he jumped up on
a sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so
he tumbled [[right]] off the roof and broke his neck, and his [[soul]] went
down to the house of [[hades]]. 

"when i had got the [[men]] together i said to them, 'you [[think]] you are
about to start [[home]] again, but circe has explained to me that instead
of this, we have got to go to the house of [[hades]] and proserpine to
consult the ghost of the theban [[prophet]] teiresias.' 

"the [[men]] were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves
on the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend
matters by crying. when we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting
our [[fate]], circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast
hard by the ship. she passed through the midst of us without our knowing
it, for who can see the comings and goings of a [[god]], if the [[god]] does
not [[wish]] to be seen?

book xi

then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into
the water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep
on board and took our places, weeping and in [[great]] distress of [[mind]].
circe, that [[great]] and cunning [[goddess]], sent us a [[fair]] wind that blew
dead aft and stayed steadily with us keeping our sails all the time
well filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear and
let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. all day long her sails
were full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went
down and darkness was over all the [[earth]], we got into the deep waters
of the river oceanus, where [[lie]] the [[land]] and [[city]] of the cimmerians
who [[live]] enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun
never pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of
the heavens [[heaven]], but the [[poor]] wretches [[live]] in one long melancholy night.
when we got there we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her,
and went along by the waters of oceanus till we came to the place
of which circe had told us. 

"here perimedes and eurylochus held the victims, while i drew my sword
and dug the trench a cubit each way. i made a drink-offering to all
the [[dead]], first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with
water, and i sprinkled [[white]] barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly
to the [[poor]] feckless ghosts, and promising them that when i got back
to ithaca i would [[sacrifice]] a barren heifer for them, the [[best]] i had,
and would load the pyre with [[good]] things. i also particularly promised
that teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the [[best]] in all
my flocks. when i had prayed sufficiently to the [[dead]], i cut the throats
of the two sheep and let the [[blood]] run into the trench, whereon the
ghosts came trooping up from erebus- brides, [[young]] bachelors, old
men worn out with toil, maids who had been crossed in [[love]], and brave
men who had been killed in [[battle]], with their armour still smirched
with [[blood]]; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench
with a [[strange]] [[kind]] of screaming sound that made me turn pale with
fear. when i saw them coming i told the [[men]] to be quick and flay the
carcasses of the two [[dead]] sheep and make burnt offerings of them,
and at the same [[time]] to repeat prayers to [[hades]] and to proserpine;
but i sat where i was with my [[sword]] drawn and would not let the poor
feckless ghosts come near the [[blood]] till teiresias should have answered
my questions [[question]]. 

"the first ghost 'that came was that of my comrade elpenor, for he
had not yet been laid beneath the [[earth]]. we had left his [[body]] unwaked
and unburied in circe's house, for we had had too much else to do.
i was very [[sorry]] for him, and cried when i saw him: 'elpenor,' said
i, 'how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness? you have
here on foot quicker than i have with my ship.' 

"'sir,' he answered with a groan, 'it was all [[bad]] [[luck]], and my own
unspeakable drunkenness. i was lying asleep on the top of circe's
house, and never [[thought]] of coming down again by the [[great]] staircase
but fell [[right]] off the roof and broke my neck, so my [[soul]] down to
the house of [[hades]]. and now i beseech you by all those whom you have
left behind you, though they are not here, by your [[wife]], by the father
who brought you up when you were a child, and by telemachus who is
the one [[hope]] of your house, do what i shall now ask you. i [[know]] that
when you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the aeaean
island. do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you,
or i may bring heaven's anger upon you; but burn me with whatever
armour i have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell
people in days to come what a [[poor]] unlucky fellow i was, and plant
over my grave the oar i used to row with when i was yet alive and
with my messmates.' and i said, 'my [[poor]] fellow, i will do all that
you have [[asked]] of me.' 

"thus, then, did we sit and hold [[sad]] talk with one another, i on the
one side of the trench with my [[sword]] held over the [[blood]], and the
ghost of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. then
came the ghost of my [[dead]] [[mother]] anticlea, [[daughter]] to autolycus.
i had left her alive when i set out for troy and was moved to tears
when i saw her, but even so, for all my [[sorrow]] i would not let her
come near the [[blood]] till i had [[asked]] my questions [[question]] of teiresias.

"then came also the ghost of theban teiresias, with his golden sceptre
in his hand. he knew me and said, 'ulysses, [[noble]] [[son]] of laertes,
why, [[poor]] [[man]], have you left the [[light]] of day and come down to visit
the [[dead]] in this [[sad]] place? stand back from the trench and withdraw
your [[sword]] that i may drink of the [[blood]] and [[answer]] your questions
truly.' 

"so i drew back, and sheathed my [[sword]], whereon when he had drank
of the [[blood]] he began with his prophecy. 

"you want to [[know]],' said he, 'about your return [[home]], but [[heaven]] will
make this hard for you. i do not [[think]] that you will escape the eye
of [[neptune]], who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having
blinded his [[son]]. still, after much suffering you may get [[home]] if you
can restrain yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the
thrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging
to the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything. if you leave these
flocks unharmed and [[think]] of nothing but of getting [[home]], you may
yet after much hardship reach ithaca; but if you harm them, then i
forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your [[men]].
even though you may yourself escape, you will return in [[bad]] plight
after losing all your [[men]], [in another man's [[man]] ship, and you will find
trouble in your house, which will be overrun by high-handed [[people]],
who are devouring your substance under the pretext of paying court
and making presents [[present]] to your [[wife]]. 

"'when you get [[home]] you will take your [[revenge]] on these suitors; and
after you have killed them by [[force]] or fraud in your own house, you
must take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to
a [[country]] where the [[people]] have never heard of the sea and do not
even mix salt with their food, nor do they [[know]] anything about ships,
and oars that are as the wings of a ship. i will give you this certain
token which cannot escape your notice. a wayfarer will meet you and
will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your
shoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice
a ram, a bull, and a boar to [[neptune]]. then go [[home]] and offer hecatombs
to an the gods in [[heaven]] one after the other. as for yourself, death
shall come to you from the sea, and your [[life]] shall ebb away very
gently when you are full of years and [[peace]] of [[mind]], and your people
shall bless you. all that i have said will come true].' 

"'this,' i answered, 'must be as it may please [[heaven]], but tell me
and tell me and tell me true, i see my [[poor]] mother's ghost close by
us; she is sitting by the [[blood]] without saying a word, and though
i am her own [[son]] she does not [[remember]] me and speak to me; tell me,
sir, how i can make her [[know]] me.' 

"'that,' said he, 'i can soon do any ghost that you let taste of the
blood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not
let them have any [[blood]] they will go away again.' 

"on this the ghost of teiresias went back to the house of [[hades]], for
his prophecyings had now been spoken, but i sat still where i was
until my [[mother]] came up and tasted the [[blood]]. then she knew me at
once and spoke fondly to me, saying, 'my [[son]], how did you come down
to this abode of darkness while you are still alive? it is a hard
thing for the living to see these places, for between us and them
there are [[great]] and terrible waters, and there is oceanus, which no
man can cross on foot, but he must have a [[good]] ship to take him. are
you all this [[time]] trying to find your way [[home]] from troy, and have
you never yet got back to ithaca nor seen your [[wife]] in your own house?'

"'mother,' said i, 'i was forced to come here to consult the ghost
of the theban [[prophet]] teiresias. i have never yet been near the achaean
land nor set foot on my native [[country]], and i have had nothing but
one long series of misfortunes from the very first day that i set
out with [[agamemnon]] for ilius, the [[land]] of [[noble]] steeds, to [[fight]] the
trojans. but tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you [[die]]? did
you have a long illness, or did [[heaven]] vouchsafe you a gentle easy
passage to eternity? tell me also about my [[father]], and the [[son]] whom
i left behind me; is my [[property]] still in their hands, or has some
one else got hold of it, who thinks [[think]] that i shall not return to claim
it? tell me again what my [[wife]] intends doing, and in what [[mind]] she
is; does she [[live]] with my [[son]] and guard my estate securely, or has
she made the [[best]] match she could and [[married]] again?' 

"my [[mother]] answered, 'your [[wife]] still remains in your house, but she
is in [[great]] distress of [[mind]] and spends her whole [[time]] in tears both
night and day. no one as yet has got possession of your fine [[property]],
and telemachus still holds your lands [[land]] undisturbed. he has to entertain
largely, as of course he must, considering his position as a magistrate,
and how every one invites him; your [[father]] remains at his old place
in the [[country]] and never goes near the town. he has no comfortable
bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in front of
the [[fire]] with the [[men]] and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when
the warm weather comes on again, he lies [[lie]] out in the vineyard on a
bed of vine leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground. he grieves continually
about your never having come [[home]], and suffers more and more as he
grows older. as for my own end it was in this [[wise]]: [[heaven]] did not
take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house, nor was i attacked
by any illness such as those that generally wear [[people]] out and kill
them, but my longing to [[know]] what you were doing and the [[force]] of
my affection for you- this it was that was the [[death]] of me.'

"then i tried to find some way of embracing my mother's ghost. thrice
i sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each time
she flitted from my embrace as it were a [[dream]] or phantom, and being
touched to the quick i said to her, 'mother, why do you not stay still
when i would embrace you? if we could throw our arms around one another
we might find [[sad]] comfort in the sharing of our sorrows [[sorrow]] even in the
house of [[hades]]; does proserpine want to lay a still further load of
grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?' 

"'my [[son]],' she answered, 'most ill-fated of all [[mankind]], it is not
proserpine that is beguiling you, but all [[people]] are like this when
they are [[dead]]. the sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together;
these perish in the fierceness of consuming [[fire]] as soon as [[life]] has
left the [[body]], and the [[soul]] flits away as though it were a [[dream]].
now, however, go back to the [[light]] of day as soon as you can, and
note all these things that you may tell them to your [[wife]] hereafter.'

"thus did we converse, and anon proserpine sent up the ghosts of the
wives and daughters [[daughter]] of all the most famous [[men]]. they gathered in crowds
about the [[blood]], and i considered how i might [[question]] them severally.
in the end i deemed that it would be [[best]] to draw the keen blade that
hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood
at once. so they came up one after the other, and each one as i questioned
her told me her [[race]] and lineage. 

"the first i saw was tyro. she was [[daughter]] of salmoneus and wife
of cretheus the [[son]] of aeolus. she fell in [[love]] with the river enipeus
who is much the most beautiful river in the whole [[world]]. once when
she was taking a walk by his side as usual, [[neptune]], disguised as
her lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue
wave arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and
god, whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.
when the [[god]] had accomplished the deed of [[love]], he took her hand in
his own and said, 'tyro, rejoice in all [[good]] will; the embraces of
the gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this
time twelve months. take [[great]] [[care]] of them. i am [[neptune]], so now
go [[home]], but hold your tongue and do not tell any one.' 

"then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore pelias and
neleus, who both of them served jove with all their might. pelias
was a [[great]] breeder of sheep and lived in iolcus, but the other lived
in pylos. the rest of her [[children]] were by cretheus, namely, aeson,
pheres, and amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.

"next to her i saw antiope, [[daughter]] to asopus, who could boast of
having slept in the arms of even jove himself, and who bore him two
sons amphion and zethus. these founded thebes with its seven gates,
and built a wall all round it; for [[strong]] though they were they could
not hold thebes till they had walled it. 

"then i saw alcmena, the [[wife]] of amphitryon, who also bore to jove
indomitable hercules; and megara who was [[daughter]] to [[great]] [[king]] creon,
and [[married]] the redoubtable [[son]] of amphitryon. 

"i also saw [[fair]] epicaste [[mother]] of [[king]] oedipodes whose awful lot
it was to [[marry]] her own [[son]] without suspecting it. he [[married]] her
after having killed his [[father]], but the gods proclaimed the whole
story to the [[world]]; whereon he remained [[king]] of thebes, in [[great]] grief
for the spite the gods had borne him; but epicaste went to the house
of the mighty jailor [[hades]], having [[hanged]] herself for [[grief]], and the
avenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother- to his ruing
bitterly thereafter. 

"then i saw chloris, whom neleus [[married]] for her [[beauty]], having given
priceless presents [[present]] for her. she was youngest [[daughter]] to amphion son
of iasus and [[king]] of minyan orchomenus, and was queen in pylos. she
bore nestor, chromius, and periclymenus, and she also bore that marvellously
lovely woman pero, who was wooed by all the [[country]] round; but neleus
would only give her to him who should raid the cattle of iphicles
from the grazing grounds of phylace, and this was a hard task. the
only [[man]] who would undertake to raid them was a [[certain]] excellent
seer, but the will of [[heaven]] was against him, for the rangers of the
cattle caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full
year had passed and the same season came round again, iphicles set
him at [[liberty]], after he had expounded all the oracles of [[heaven]].
thus, then, was the will of jove accomplished. 

"and i saw leda the [[wife]] of tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons [[son]],
castor breaker of horses, and pollux the mighty boxer. both these
heroes are lying under the [[earth]], though they are still alive, for
by a special dispensation of jove, they [[die]] and come to [[life]] again,
each one of them every other day throughout all [[time]], and they have
the rank of gods. 

"after her i saw iphimedeia [[wife]] of aloeus who boasted the embrace
of [[neptune]]. she bore two sons [[son]] otus and ephialtes, but both were short
lived. they were the finest [[children]] that were ever born in this [[world]],
and the [[best]] looking, orion only excepted; for at nine years old they
were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest.
they threatened to make [[war]] with the gods in [[olympus]], and tried to
set mount ossa on the top of mount [[olympus]], and mount pelion on the
top of ossa, that they might scale [[heaven]] itself, and they would have
done it too if they had been grown up, but [[apollo]], [[son]] of leto, killed
both of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their
cheeks or chin. 

"then i saw phaedra, and procris, and [[fair]] ariadne [[daughter]] of the
magician minos, whom theseus was carrying off from crete to [[athens]],
but he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so diana killed her
in the island of dia on account of what bacchus had said against her.

"i also saw maera and clymene and hateful eriphyle, who sold her own
husband for gold. but it would take me all night if i were to name
every [[single]] one of the wives [[wife]] and daughters [[daughter]] of heroes whom i saw,
and it is [[time]] for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew,
or here. as for my escort, [[heaven]] and yourselves will see to it."

here he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless
throughout the covered cloister. then arete said to them:

"what do you [[think]] of this [[man]], o phaecians? is he not tall and good
looking, and is he not clever? true, he is my own guest, but all of
you share in the distinction. do not he a hurry to send him away,
nor niggardly in the presents [[present]] you make to one who is in such great
need, for [[heaven]] has blessed all of you with [[great]] abundance."

then spoke the aged hero echeneus who was one of the oldest [[men]] among
them, "my [[friends]]," said he, "what our august queen has just said
to us is both reasonable and to the [[purpose]], therefore be persuaded
by it; but the decision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with
king alcinous." 

"the thing shall be done," exclaimed alcinous, "as surely as i still
live and reign over the phaeacians. our guest is indeed very anxious
to get [[home]], still we must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow,
by which [[time]] i shall be able to get together the whole sum that i
mean to give him. as regards- his escort it will be a matter for you
all, and mine above all others as the [[chief]] [[person]] among you."

and [[ulysses]] answered, "king alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay
here for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded
with your [[noble]] gifts, i should obey you gladly and it would redound
greatly to my advantage, for i should return fuller-handed to my own
people, and should thus be more respected and beloved by all who see
me when i get back to ithaca." 

"ulysses," replied alcinous, "not one of us who sees you has any idea
that you are a charlatan or a swindler. i [[know]] there are many people
going about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to
see through them, but there is a style about your [[language]] which assures
me of your [[good]] disposition. moreover you have told the story of your
own misfortunes, and those of the argives, as though you were a practised
bard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the mighty
heroes who went to troy at the same [[time]] with yourself, and perished
there. the evenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet
bed time- go on, therefore, with your [[divine]] story, for i could stay
here listening till to-morrow morning, so long as you will continue
to tell us of your adventures." 

"alcinous," answered [[ulysses]], "there is a [[time]] for making speeches [[speech]],
and a [[time]] for going to bed; nevertheless, since you so [[desire]], i
will not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of
my comrades who did not fall fighting with the trojans, but perished
on their return, through the treachery of a wicked woman.

"when proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions,
the ghost of [[agamemnon]] [[son]] of atreus came sadly up tome, surrounded
by those who had perished with him in the house of aegisthus. as soon
as he had tasted the [[blood]] he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched
out his arms towards me to embrace me; but he had no [[strength]] nor
substance any more, and i too wept and pitied him as i beheld him.
'how did you come by your [[death]],' said i, 'king [[agamemnon]]? did neptune
raise his winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did
your enemies [[enemy]] make an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting
or sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of their
wives and [[city]]?' 

"'ulysses,' he answered, 'noble [[son]] of laertes, was not lost at sea
in any storm of neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon
the mainland, but aegisthus and my wicked [[wife]] were the [[death]] of me
between them. he [[asked]] me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered
me most miserably as though i were a fat beast in a slaughter house,
while all around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for
the wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great
nobleman. you must have seen numbers of [[men]] killed either in a general
engagement, or in [[single]] combat, but you never saw anything so truly
pitiable as the way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing-bowl
and the loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with
our-blood. i heard priam's [[daughter]] cassandra scream as clytemnestra
killed her close beside me. i lay dying upon the [[earth]] with the sword
in my [[body]], and raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but
she slipped away from me; she would not even close my lips nor my
eyes when i was dying, for there is nothing in this [[world]] so cruel
and so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as
hers was. fancy murdering her own husband! i [[thought]] i was going to
be welcomed [[home]] by my [[children]] and my servants, but her abominable
crime has brought disgrace on herself and all [[women]] who shall come
after- even on the [[good]] ones.' 

"and i said, 'in [[truth]] jove has hated the house of atreus from first
to [[last]] in the matter of their women's counsels. see how many of us
fell for helen's sake, and now it seems that clytemnestra hatched
mischief against too during your absence.' 

"'be sure, therefore,' continued [[agamemnon]], 'and not be too friendly
even with your own [[wife]]. do not tell her all that you [[know]] perfectly
well yourself. tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about
the rest. not that your [[wife]], [[ulysses]], is likely to murder you, for
penelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent [[nature]]. we
left her a [[young]] bride with an infant at her breast when we set out
for troy. this child no [[doubt]] is now grown up happily to man's [[man]] estate,
and he and his [[father]] will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another
as it is [[right]] they should do, whereas my wicked [[wife]] did not even
allow me the [[happiness]] of looking upon my [[son]], but killed me ere i
could do so. furthermore i say- and lay my saying to your heart- do
not tell [[people]] when you are bringing your ship to ithaca, but steal
a march upon them, for after all this there is no trusting [[women]].
but now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news of my
son orestes? is he in orchomenus, or at pylos, or is he at sparta
with menelaus- for i presume that he is still living.' 

"and i said, 'agamemnon, why do you ask me? i do not [[know]] whether
your [[son]] is alive or [[dead]], and it is not [[right]] to talk when one does
not [[know]].' 

"as we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the
ghost of achilles came up to us with patroclus, antilochus, and ajax
who was the finest and goodliest [[man]] of all the danaans after the
son of peleus. the fleet descendant of aeacus knew me and spoke piteously,
saying, 'ulysses, [[noble]] [[son]] of laertes, what deed of daring will you
undertake next, that you venture down to the house of [[hades]] among
us silly [[dead]], who are but the ghosts of them that can [[labour]] no more?'

"and i said, 'achilles, [[son]] of peleus, foremost champion of the achaeans,
i came to consult teiresias, and see if he could advise me about my
return [[home]] to ithaca, for i have never yet been able to get near
the achaean [[land]], nor to set foot in my own [[country]], but have been
in trouble all the [[time]]. as for you, achilles, no one was ever yet
so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored
by all us argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are
here you are a [[great]] [[prince]] among the [[dead]]. do not, therefore, take
it so much to [[heart]] even if you are [[dead]].' 

"'say not a word,' he answered, 'in death's favour; i would rather
be a paid servant in a [[poor]] man's [[man]] house and be above ground than king
of kings [[king]] among the [[dead]]. but give me news about [[son]]; is he gone to
the wars [[war]] and will he be a [[great]] soldier, or is this not so? tell me
also if you have heard anything about my [[father]] peleus- does he still
rule among the myrmidons, or do they show him no [[respect]] throughout
hellas and phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? could
i but stand by his side, in the [[light]] of day, with the same strength
that i had when i killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of
troy- could i but be as i then was and go even for a short [[time]] to
my father's house, any one who tried to do him [[violence]] or supersede
him would soon me it.' 

"'i have heard nothing,' i answered, 'of peleus, but i can tell you
all about your [[son]] neoptolemus, for i took him in my own ship from
scyros with the achaeans. in our councils of [[war]] before troy he was
always first to speak, and his judgement was unerring. nestor and
i were the only two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting
on the plain of troy, he would never remain with the [[body]] of his [[men]],
but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valour. many
a [[man]] did he kill in battle- i cannot name every [[single]] one of those
whom he slew while fighting on the side of the argives, but will only
say how he killed that valiant hero eurypylus [[son]] of telephus, who
was the handsomest [[man]] i ever saw except memnon; many others also
of the ceteians fell around him by [[reason]] of a woman's bribes. moreover,
when all the bravest of the argives went inside the horse that epeus
had made, and it was left to me to settle when we should either open
the door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders
and [[chief]] [[men]] among the danaans were drying their [[eyes]] and quaking
in every limb, i never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from
his cheek; he was all the [[time]] urging me to break out from the horse-
grasping the handle of his [[sword]] and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing
fury against the foe. yet when we had sacked the [[city]] of priam he
got his handsome share of the prize [[money]] and went on board (such
is the [[fortune]] of war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown
spear nor in close combat, for the rage of [[mars]] is a matter of great
chance.' 

"when i had told him this, the ghost of achilles strode off across
a meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what i had said concerning
the prowess of his [[son]]. 

"the ghosts of other [[dead]] [[men]] stood near me and told me each his own
melancholy tale; but that of ajax [[son]] of telamon alone held aloof-
still angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about
the armour of achilles. thetis had offered it as a prize, but the
trojan prisoners [[prisoner]] and minerva were the judges [[judge]]. would that i had never
gained the day in such a contest, for it cost the [[life]] of ajax, who
was foremost of all the danaans after the [[son]] of peleus, alike in
stature and prowess. 

"when i saw him i tried to pacify him and said, 'ajax, will you not
forget and [[forgive]] even in [[death]], but must the judgement about that
hateful armour still rankle with you? it cost us argives dear enough
to lose such a tower of [[strength]] as you were to us. we mourned you
as much as we mourned achilles [[son]] of peleus himself, nor can the
blame be laid on anything but on the spite which jove bore against
the danaans, for it was this that made him counsel your destruction-
come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection, and
hear what i can tell you.' 

"he would not [[answer]], but turned away to erebus and to the other ghosts;
nevertheless, i should have made him talk to me in spite of his being
so angry, or i should have gone talking to him, only that there were
still others among the [[dead]] whom i [[desired]] to see. 

"then i saw minos [[son]] of jove with his golden sceptre in his hand
sitting in judgement on the [[dead]], and the ghosts were gathered sitting
and standing round him in the spacious house of [[hades]], to learn his
sentences upon them. 

"after him i saw huge orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the
ghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and
he had a [[great]] bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.

"and i saw tityus [[son]] of gaia stretched upon the plain and covering
some nine acres of ground. two vultures on either side of him were
digging their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat
them off with his hands, but could not; for he had violated jove's
mistress leto as she was going through panopeus on her way to pytho.

"i saw also the dreadful [[fate]] of tantalus, who stood in a lake that
reached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never
reach the water, for whenever the [[poor]] creature stooped to drink,
it dried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dry ground-
parched by the spite of [[heaven]]. there were tall trees, moreover, that
shed their fruit over his head- pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet
figs and juicy olives, but whenever the [[poor]] creature stretched out
his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back again to
the clouds. 

"and i saw sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone
with both his hands. with hands and feet he' tried to roll it up to
the top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over
on to the other side, its weight would be too much for him, and the
pitiless stone would come thundering down again on to the plain. then
he would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran
off him and the steam rose after him. 

"after him i saw mighty hercules, but it was his phantom only, for
he is feasting ever with the [[immortal]] gods, and has lovely hebe to
wife, who is [[daughter]] of jove and juno. the ghosts were screaming
round him like scared birds flying all whithers. he looked black as
night with his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string,
glaring around as though ever on the point of taking aim. about his
breast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellous
fashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming [[eyes]]; there
was also [[war]], [[battle]], and [[death]]. the [[man]] who made that belt, do what
he might, would never be able to make another like it. hercules knew
me at once when he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, my [[poor]] [[ulysses]],
noble [[son]] of laertes, are you too leading the same [[sorry]] [[kind]] of life
that i did when i was above ground? i was [[son]] of jove, but i went
through an infinity of suffering, for i became bondsman to one who
was far beneath me- a low fellow who set me all manner of labours [[labour]].
he once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound- for he did not think
he could find anything harder for me than this, but i got the hound
out of [[hades]] and brought him to him, for mercury and minerva helped
me.' 

"on this hercules went down again into the house of [[hades]], but i stayed
where i was in case some other of the mighty [[dead]] should come to me.
and i should have seen still other of them that are gone before, whom
i would fain have seen- theseus and pirithous glorious [[children]] of
the gods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered
such appalling cries, that i was panic stricken lest proserpine should
send up from the house of [[hades]] the head of that awful monster gorgon.
on this i hastened back to my ship and ordered my [[men]] to go on board
at once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places,
whereon the ship went down the stream of the river oceanus. we had
to row at first, but presently a [[fair]] wind sprang up. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book xii

"after we were clear of the river oceanus, and had got out into the
open sea, we went on till we reached the aeaean island where there
is dawn and sunrise as in other places. we then drew our ship on to
the sands and got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep
and waited till day should break. 

"then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, i
sent some [[men]] to circe's house to fetch the [[body]] of elpenor. we cut
firewood from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and
after we had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral
rites. when his [[body]] and armour had been burned to ashes, we raised
a cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed
the oar that he had been used to row with. 

"while we were doing all this, circe, who knew that we had got back
from the house of [[hades]], dressed herself and came to us as fast as
she could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread,
meat, and wine. then she stood in the midst of us and said, 'you have
done a bold thing in going down alive to the house of [[hades]], and you
will have died twice, to other people's once; now, then, stay here
for the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on with your voyage
at daybreak tomorrow morning. in the meantime i will tell ulysses
about your course, and will explain everything to him so as to prevent
your suffering from misadventure either by [[land]] or sea.'

"we agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong
day to the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it
came on dark, the [[men]] laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables
of the ship. then circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated
away from the others, while she reclined by my side and [[asked]] me all
about our adventures. 

"'so far so [[good]],' said she, when i had ended my story, 'and now pay
attention to what i am about to tell you- [[heaven]] itself, indeed, will
recall it to your recollection. first you will come to the sirens
who enchant all who come near them. if any one unwarily draws in too
close and hears the singing of the sirens, his [[wife]] and [[children]] will
never welcome him [[home]] again, for they sit in a green field and warble
him to [[death]] with the sweetness of their [[song]]. there is a [[great]] heap
of [[dead]] men's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting
off them. therefore pass these sirens by, and stop your men's ears
with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen
yourself, for you may get the [[men]] to bind you as you stand upright
on a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they must lash the rope's
ends to the mast itself, that you may have the [[pleasure]] of listening.
if you beg and [[pray]] the [[men]] to unloose you, then they must bind you
faster. 

"'when your crew have taken you [[past]] these sirens, i cannot give you
coherent directions as to which of two courses you are to take; i
will lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them
for yourself. on the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against
which the deep blue waves of amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the
blessed gods call these rocks the wanderers. here not even a bird
may pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to father
jove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and father
jove has to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever
yet came to these rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds
of [[fire]] are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies [[body]] of [[dead]] [[men]].
the only vessel that ever sailed and got through, was the famous argo
on her way from the house of aetes, and she too would have gone against
these [[great]] rocks, only that juno piloted her [[past]] them for the love
she bore to jason. 

"'of these two rocks the one reaches [[heaven]] and its peak is lost in
a dark cloud. this never leaves it, so that the top is never clear
not even in summer and early autumn. no [[man]] though he had twenty hands
and twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs
sheer up, as smooth as though it had been polished. in the middle
of it there is a large cavern, looking west and turned towards erebus;
you must take your ship this way, but the cave is so high up that
not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. inside it
scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be that
of a [[young]] hound, but in [[truth]] she is a dreadful monster and no one-
not even a god- could face her without being terror-struck. she has
twelve mis-shapen feet, and six necks of the most prodigious length;
and at the end of each neck she has a frightful head with three rows
of teeth in each, all set very close together, so that they would
crunch any one to [[death]] in a moment, and she sits deep within her
shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,
fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can
catch, of the thousands with which amphitrite teems. no ship ever
yet got [[past]] her without losing some [[men]], for she shoots out all her
heads at once, and carries off a [[man]] in each mouth. 

"'you will find the other rocks [[lie]] lower, but they are so close together
that there is not more than a bowshot between them. [a large fig tree
in full leaf grows upon it], and under it lies [[lie]] the sucking whirlpool
of charybdis. three times [[time]] in the day does she vomit forth her waters,
and three times [[time]] she sucks them down again; see that you be not there
when she is sucking, for if you are, [[neptune]] himself could not save
you; you must hug the scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you
can, for you had [[better]] lose six [[men]] than your whole crew.'

"'is there no way,' said i, 'of escaping charybdis, and at the same
time keeping scylla off when she is trying to harm my [[men]]?'

"'you dare-devil,' replied the [[goddess]], you are always wanting to
fight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even
by the immortals [[immortal]]. for scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage,
extreme, rude, cruel and invincible. there is no [[help]] for it; your
best [[chance]] will be to get by her as fast as ever you can, for if
you dawdle about her rock while you are putting on your armour, she
may catch you with a second cast of her six heads, and snap up another
half dozen of your [[men]]; so drive your ship [[past]] her at full speed,
and roar out lustily to crataiis who is scylla's dam, [[bad]] [[luck]] to
her; she will then stop her from making a second raid upon you.

"'you will now come to the thrinacian island, and here you will see
many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god-
seven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in
each flock. they do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number,
and they are tended by the goddesses [[goddess]] phaethusa and lampetie, who are
children of the sun-god hyperion by neaera. their [[mother]] when she
had borne them and had done suckling them sent them to the thrinacian
island, which was a long way off, to [[live]] there and look after their
father's flocks and herds. if you leave these flocks unharmed, and
think of nothing but getting [[home]], you may yet after much hardship
reach ithaca; but if you harm them, then i forewarn you of the destruction
both of your ship and of your comrades; and even though you may yourself
escape, you will return late, in [[bad]] plight, after losing all your
men.' 

"here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in [[heaven]],
whereon she returned inland. i then went on board and told my men
to loose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her,
took their places, and began to smite the grey sea with their oars.
presently the [[great]] and cunning [[goddess]] circe befriended us with a
fair wind that blew [[dead]] aft, and stayed steadily with us, keeping
our sails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's
gear, and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her. 

"then, being much troubled in [[mind]], i said to my [[men]], 'my [[friends]],
it is not [[right]] that one or two of us alone should [[know]] the prophecies
that circe has made me, i will therefore tell you about them, so that
whether we [[live]] or [[die]] we may do so with our [[eyes]] open. first she
said we were to keep clear of the sirens, who sit and sing most beautifully
in a field of flowers; but she said i might hear them myself so long
as no one else did. therefore, take me and bind me to the crosspiece
half way up the mast; bind me as i stand upright, with a bond so fast
that i cannot possibly break away, and lash the rope's ends to the
mast itself. if i beg and [[pray]] you to set me [[free]], then bind me more
tightly still.' 

"i had hardly finished telling everything to the [[men]] before we reached
the island of the two sirens, for the wind had been very favourable.
then all of a sudden it fell [[dead]] calm; there was not a breath of
wind nor a ripple upon the water, so the [[men]] furled the sails and
stowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened the water with
the foam they raised in rowing. meanwhile i look a large wheel of
wax and cut it up small with my [[sword]]. then i kneaded the wax in my
strong hands till it became soft, which it soon did between the kneading
and the rays of the sun-god [[son]] of hyperion. then i stopped the ears
of all my [[men]], and they bound me hands and feet to the mast as i stood
upright on the crosspiece; but they went on rowing themselves. when
we had got within earshot of the [[land]], and the ship was going at a
good rate, the sirens saw that we were getting in shore and began
with their singing. 

"'come here,' they sang, 'renowned [[ulysses]], [[honour]] to the achaean
name, and listen to our two voices. no one ever sailed [[past]] us without
staying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song- and he who listens
will go on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we [[know]] all the
ills that the gods laid upon the argives and trojans before troy,
and can tell you everything that is going to happen over the whole
world.' 

"they sang these words most musically, and as i longed to hear them
further i made by frowning to my [[men]] that they should set me [[free]];
but they quickened their stroke, and eurylochus and perimedes bound
me with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the
sirens' voices. then my [[men]] took the wax from their ears and unbound
me. 

"immediately after we had got [[past]] the island i saw a [[great]] wave from
which spray was rising, and i heard a loud roaring sound. the men
were so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole
sea resounded with the rushing of the waters, but the ship stayed
where it was, for the [[men]] had left off rowing. i went round, therefore,
and exhorted them [[man]] by [[man]] not to lose [[heart]]. 

"'my [[friends]],' said i, 'this is not the first [[time]] that we have been
in danger, and we are in nothing like so [[bad]] a case as when the cyclops
shut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my [[courage]] and [[wise]] counsel
saved us then, and we shall [[live]] to look back on all this as well.
now, therefore, let us all do as i say, trust in jove and row on with
might and main. as for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend
to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these
steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and
be over yonder before you [[know]] where you are, and you will be the
death of us.' 

"so they did as i told them; but i said nothing about the awful monster
scylla, for i knew the [[men]] would not on rowing if i did, but would
huddle together in the hold. in one thing only did i disobey circe's
strict instructions- i put on my armour. then seizing two [[strong]] spears
i took my stand on the ship is bows, for it was there that i expected
first to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my [[men]] so much
harm; but i could not make her out anywhere, though i strained my
eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over 

"then we entered the straits in [[great]] [[fear]] of [[mind]], for on the one
hand was scylla, and on the other dread charybdis kept sucking up
the salt water. as she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron
when it is boiling over upon a [[great]] [[fire]], and the spray reached the
top of the rocks on either side. when she began to suck again, we
could see the water all inside whirling round and round, and it made
a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. we could see the
bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the [[men]] were
at their wit's ends for [[fear]]. while we were taken up with this, and
were expecting each moment to be our [[last]], scylla pounced down suddenly
upon us and snatched up my six [[best]] [[men]]. i was looking at once after
both ship and [[men]], and in a moment i saw their hands and feet ever
so high above me, struggling in the air as scylla was carrying them
off, and i heard them call out my name in one [[last]] despairing cry.
as a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some jutting rock throws
bait into the water to [[deceive]] the [[poor]] little fishes, and spears
them with the ox's horn with which his spear is shod, throwing them
gasping on to the [[land]] as he catches them one by one- even so did
scylla [[land]] these panting creatures on her rock and munch them up
at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and stretched out their
hands to me in their mortal agony. this was the most sickening sight
that i saw throughout all my voyages. 

"when we had passed the [wandering] rocks, with scylla and terrible
charybdis, we reached the [[noble]] island of the sun-god, where were
the goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun hyperion. while still
at sea in my ship i could bear the cattle lowing as they came home
to the yards, and the sheep bleating. then i remembered what the blind
theban [[prophet]] teiresias had told me, and how carefully aeaean circe
had warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god. so being
much troubled i said to the [[men]], 'my [[men]], i [[know]] you are hard pressed,
but listen while i tell you the prophecy that teiresias made me, and
how carefully aeaean circe warned me to shun the island of the blessed
sun-god, for it was here, she said, that our worst danger would [[lie]].
head the ship, therefore, away from the island.' 

"the [[men]] were in despair at this, and eurylochus at once gave me an
insolent [[answer]]. 'ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are very
strong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron,
and now, though your [[men]] are exhausted with toil and want of sleep,
you will not let them [[land]] and cook themselves a [[good]] supper upon
this island, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly
on through the watches of the flying night. it is by night that the
winds blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should
one of those sudden squalls spring up from south west or west, which
so often wreck a vessel when our lords [[lord]] the gods are unpropitious?
now, therefore, let us obey the of night and prepare our supper here
hard by the ship; to-morrow morning we will go on board again and
put out to sea.' 

"thus spoke eurylochus, and the [[men]] approved his words. i saw that
heaven meant us a mischief and said, 'you [[force]] me to yield, for you
are many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his
solemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock
of sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a [[single]] head of either,
but will be satisfied with the food that circe has given us.'

"they all swore as i bade them, and when they had completed their
oath we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of
fresh water, and the [[men]] went ashore and cooked their suppers. as
soon as they had had enough to [[eat]] and drink, they began talking about
their [[poor]] comrades whom scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set
them weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a sound
sleep. 

"in the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their
places, jove raised a [[great]] gale of wind that flew a hurricane so
that [[land]] and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang
forth out of the heavens [[heaven]]. when the child of morning, rosy-fingered
dawn, appeared, we brought the ship to [[land]] and drew her into a cave
wherein the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and i called
the [[men]] together in council. 

"'my [[friends]],' said i, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let us
mind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for
it; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees
and gives ear to everything. and again they promised that they would
obey. 

"for a whole month the wind blew steadily from the south, and there
was no other wind, but only south and east. as long as corn and wine
held out the [[men]] did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when,
however, they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced
to go further afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking
whatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. one
day, therefore, i went up inland that i might [[pray]] [[heaven]] to show
me some means of getting away. when i had gone far enough to be clear
of all my [[men]], and had found a place that was well sheltered from
the wind, i washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in olympus
till by and by they sent me off into a sweet sleep. 

"meanwhile eurylochus had been giving [[evil]] counsel to the [[men]], 'listen
to me,' said he, 'my [[poor]] comrades. all deaths [[death]] are [[bad]] enough but
there is none so [[bad]] as famine. why should not we drive in the best
of these cows and offer them in [[sacrifice]] to the [[immortal]] rods? if
we ever get back to ithaca, we can build a fine temple to the sun-god
and enrich it with every [[kind]] of ornament; if, however, he is determined
to sink our ship out of [[revenge]] for these homed cattle, and the other
gods are of the same [[mind]], i for one would rather drink salt water
once for all and have done with it, than be starved to [[death]] by inches
in such a desert island as this is.' 

"thus spoke eurylochus, and the [[men]] approved his words. now the cattle,
so [[fair]] and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the [[men]], therefore
drove in the [[best]] of them, and they all stood round them saying their
prayers, and using [[young]] oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there
was no barley left. when they had done praying they killed the cows
and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the thigh bones, wrapped
them round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on
top of them. they had no wine with which to make drink-offerings over
the [[sacrifice]] while it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a little
water from [[time]] to [[time]] while the inward meats were being grilled;
then, when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward
meats, they cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits.

"by this [[time]] my deep sleep had left me, and i turned back to the
ship and to the sea shore. as i drew near i began to smell hot roast
meat, so i groaned out a prayer to the [[immortal]] gods. 'father jove,'
i exclaimed, 'and all you other gods who [[live]] in everlasting bliss,
you have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have
sent me; see what fine [[work]] these [[men]] of mine have been making in
my absence.' 

"meanwhile lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had
been killing his cows, whereon he flew into a [[great]] rage, and said
to the immortals [[immortal]], 'father jove, and all you other gods who [[live]] in
everlasting bliss, i must have vengeance on the crew of ulysses' ship:
they have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one thing
i loved to look upon, whether i was going up [[heaven]] or down again.
if they do not square accounts with me about my cows, i will go down
to [[hades]] and shine there among the [[dead]].' 

"'sun,' said jove, 'go on shining upon us gods and upon [[mankind]] over
the fruitful [[earth]]. i will shiver their ship into little pieces with
a bolt of [[white]] lightning as soon as they get out to sea.'

"i was told all this by calypso, who said she had heard it from the
mouth of mercury. 

"as soon as i got down to my ship and to the sea shore i rebuked each
one of the [[men]] separately, but we could see no way out of it, for
the cows were [[dead]] already. and indeed the gods began at once to show
signs and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about,
and the joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and the meat,
whether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.

"for six days my [[men]] kept driving in the [[best]] cows and feasting upon
them, but when jove the [[son]] of saturn had added a seventh day, the
fury of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts,
spread sail, and put out to sea. as soon as we were well away from
the island, and could see nothing but [[sky]] and sea, the [[son]] of saturn
raised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath
it. we not get on much further, for in another moment we were caught
by a terrific squall from the west that snapped the forestays of the
mast so that it fell aft, while all the ship's gear tumbled about
at the bottom of the vessel. the mast fell upon the head of the helmsman
in the ship's stern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to
pieces, and he fell overboard as though he were diving, with no more
life left in him. 

"then jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round
and round, and was filled with [[fire]] and brimstone as the lightning
struck it. the [[men]] all fell into the sea; they were carried about
in the water round the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but the
god presently deprived them of all [[chance]] of getting [[home]] again.

"i stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel
(which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in
the direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong
still hanging about it, and with this i lashed the mast and keel together,
and getting astride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to
take me. 

"[the gale from the west had now spent its [[force]], and the wind got
into the south again, which frightened me lest i should be taken back
to the terrible whirlpool of charybdis. this indeed was what actually
happened, for i was borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise
had reacfied the rock of scylla, and the whirlpool. she was then sucking
down the salt sea water, but i was carried aloft toward the fig tree,
which i caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. i could not plant
my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the roots were a long
way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too high,
too vast, and too far apart for me to reach them; so i hung patiently
on, waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft again-
and a very long while it seemed. a juryman is not more glad to get
home to supper, after having been long detained in court by troublesome
cases, than i was to see my raft beginning to [[work]] its way out of
the whirlpool again. at [[last]] i let go with my hands and feet, and
fell heavily into the sea, bard by my raft on to which i then got,
and began to row with my hands. as for scylla, the [[father]] of gods
and [[men]] would not let her get further sight of me- otherwise i should
have certainly been lost.] 

"hence i was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the
gods stranded me on the ogygian island, where dwells the [[great]] and
powerful [[goddess]] calypso. she took me in and was [[kind]] to me, but i
need say no more about this, for i told you and your [[noble]] [[wife]] all
about it yesterday, and i hate saying the same thing over and over
again." 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book xiii

thus did he speak, and they all held their [[peace]] throughout the covered
cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently alcinous
began to speak. 

"ulysses," said he, "now that you have reached my house i [[doubt]] not
you will get [[home]] without further misadventure no matter how much
you have [[suffered]] in the [[past]]. to you others, however, who come here
night after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard,
i would insist as follows. our guest has already packed up the clothes,
wrought gold, and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance;
let us now, therefore, [[present]] him further, each one of us, with a
large tripod and a cauldron. we will recoup ourselves by the levy
of a general rate; for private individuals [[individual]] cannot be expected to bear
the burden of such a handsome [[present]]." 

every one approved of this, and then they went [[home]] to bed each in
his own abode. when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared,
they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them.
alcinous went on board and saw everything so securely stowed under
the ship's benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the
rowers. then they went to the house of alcinous to get dinner, and
he sacrificed a bull for them in [[honour]] of jove who is the [[lord]] of
all. they set the steaks to grill and made an excellent dinner, after
which the inspired bard, demodocus, who was a favourite with every
one, sang to them; but [[ulysses]] kept on turning his [[eyes]] towards the
sun, as though to hasten his setting, for he was longing to be on
his way. as one who has been all day ploughing a fallow field with
a couple of oxen keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when
night comes that he may go and get it, for it is all his legs can
do to carry him, even so did [[ulysses]] rejoice when the sun went down,
and he at once said to the phaecians, addressing himself more particularly
to [[king]] alcinous: 

"sir, and all of you, farewell. make your drink-offerings and send
me on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's [[desire]] by
giving me an escort, and making me presents [[present]], which [[heaven]] grant that
i may turn to [[good]] account; may i find my admirable [[wife]] living in
peace among [[friends]], and may you whom i leave behind me give satisfaction
to your wives [[wife]] and [[children]]; may [[heaven]] vouchsafe you every [[good]] grace,
and may no [[evil]] thing come among your [[people]]." 

thus did he speak. his hearers all of them approved his saying and
agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably.
alcinous therefore said to his servant, "pontonous, mix some wine
and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to father
jove, and speed our guest upon his way." 

pontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others
each from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed gods that
live in [[heaven]], but [[ulysses]] rose and placed the double cup in the
hands of queen arete. 

"farewell, queen," said he, "henceforward and for ever, till [[age]] and
death, the [[common]] lot of [[mankind]], lay their hands upon you. i now
take my leave; be [[happy]] in this house with your [[children]], your [[people]],
and with [[king]] alcinous." 

as he spoke he crossed the threshold, and alcinous sent a [[man]] to conduct
him to his ship and to the sea shore. arete also sent some maid servants
with him- one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to carry his strong-box,
and a third with corn and wine. when they got to the water side the
crew took these things and put them on board, with all the meat and
drink; but for [[ulysses]] they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck
that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship. then he too
went on board and lay down without a word, but the crew took every
man his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone to which
it had been bound. thereon, when they began rowing out to sea, ulysses
fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber. 

the ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies
over the course when the horses [[feel]] the whip. her prow curveted as
it were the neck of a stallion, and a [[great]] wave of dark blue water
seethed in her wake. she held steadily on her course, and even a falcon,
swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her. thus, then,
she cut her way through the water. carrying one who was as cunning
as the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of all
that he had [[suffered]] both on the field of [[battle]] and by the waves
of the weary sea. 

when the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show.
the ship drew near to [[land]]. now there is in ithaca a haven of the
old merman phorcys, which lies [[lie]] between two points that break the line
of the sea and shut the harbour in. these shelter it from the storms
of wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a
ship may [[lie]] without being even moored. at the head of this harbour
there is a large olive tree, and at no distance a fine overarching
cavern [[sacred]] to the nymphs [[nymph]] who are called naiads. there are mixing-bowls
within it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive there. moreover,
there are [[great]] looms of stone on which the nymphs [[nymph]] weave their robes
of sea purple- very [[curious]] to see- and at all times [[time]] there is water
within it. it has two entrances, one facing north by which mortals
can go down into the cave, while the other comes from the south and
is more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the
way taken by the gods. 

into this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the place,
she had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length on to
the shore; when, however, they had landed, the first thing they did
was to lift [[ulysses]] with his rug and linen sheet out of the ship,
and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. then they took out
the presents [[present]] which minerva had persuaded the phaeacians to give him
when he was setting out on his [[voyage]] homewards. they put these all
together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear
some passer by might come and steal them before [[ulysses]] awoke; and
then they made the [[best]] of their way [[home]] again. 

but [[neptune]] did not forget the threats with which he had already threatened
ulysses, so he took counsel with jove. "father jove," said he, "i
shall no longer be held in any sort of [[respect]] among you gods, if
mortals like the phaeacians, who are my own flesh and [[blood]], show
such small regard for me. i said i would [[ulysses]] get [[home]] when he
had [[suffered]] sufficiently. i did not say that he should never get
home at all, for i knew you had already nodded your head about it,
and promised that he should do so; but now they have brought him in
a ship fast asleep and have landed him in ithaca after loading him
with more magnificent presents [[present]] of bronze, gold, and raiment than he
would ever have brought back from troy, if he had had his share of
the spoil and got [[home]] without misadventure." 

and jove answered, "what, o [[lord]] of the earthquake, are you talking
about? the gods are by no means wanting in [[respect]] for you. it would
be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are.
as regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence
and treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself
to deal with him as you may [[think]] proper, so do just as you please."

"i should have done so at once," replied [[neptune]], "if i were not anxious
to avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, i should
like to wreck the phaecian ship as it is returning from its escort.
this will stop them from escorting [[people]] in future; and i should
also like to bury their [[city]] under a huge mountain." 

"my [[good]] friend," answered jove, "i should recommend you at the very
moment when the [[people]] from the [[city]] are watching the ship on her
way, to turn it into a rock near the [[land]] and looking like a ship.
this will astonish everybody, and you can then bury their [[city]] under
the mountain." 

when earth-encircling [[neptune]] heard this he went to scheria where
the phaecians [[live]], and stayed there till the ship, which was making
rapid way, had got close-in. then he went up to it, turned it into
stone, and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it
in the ground. after this he went away. 

the phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would
turn towards his neighbour, saying, "bless my [[heart]], who is it that
can have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port?
we could see the whole of her only moment ago." 

this was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and alcinous
said, "i [[remember]] now the old prophecy of my [[father]]. he said that
neptune would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over
the sea, and would one day wreck a phaeacian ship as it was returning
from an escort, and bury our [[city]] under a high mountain. this was
what my old [[father]] used to say, and now it is all coming true. now
therefore let us all do as i say; in the first place we must leave
off giving [[people]] escorts when they come here, and in the next let
us [[sacrifice]] twelve picked bulls to [[neptune]] that he may have mercy
upon us, and not bury our [[city]] under the high mountain." when the
people heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls.

thus did the chiefs [[chief]] and rulers of the phaecians to [[king]] [[neptune]], standing
round his altar; and at the same [[time]] [[ulysses]] woke up once more upon
his own soil. he had been so long away that he did not [[know]] it again;
moreover, jove's [[daughter]] minerva had made it a foggy day, so that
people might not [[know]] of his having come, and that she might tell
him everything without either his [[wife]] or his fellow [[citizens]] and
friends recognizing him until he had taken his [[revenge]] upon the wicked
suitors. everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him- the
long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the goodly
trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native
land. so he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried
aloud despairingly. 

"alas," he exclaimed, "among what manner of [[people]] am i fallen? are
they savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane? where shall
i put all this treasure, and which way shall i go? i [[wish]] i had stayed
over there with the phaeacians; or i could have gone to some other
great [[chief]] who would have been [[good]] to me and given me an escort.
as it is i do not [[know]] where to put my treasure, and i cannot leave
it here for [[fear]] somebody else should get hold of it. in [[good]] truth
the chiefs [[chief]] and rulers of the phaeacians have not been dealing fairly
by me, and have left me in the [[wrong]] [[country]]; they said they would
take me back to ithaca and they have not done so: may jove the protector
of suppliants chastise them, for he watches over everybody and punishes
those who do [[wrong]]. still, i suppose i must count my goods [[good]] and see
if the crew have gone off with any of them." 

he counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his
clothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about
not being in his own [[country]], and wandered up and down by the shore
of the sounding sea bewailing his hard [[fate]]. then minerva came up
to him disguised as a [[young]] shepherd of delicate and princely mien,
with a [[good]] cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals
on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. [[ulysses]] was glad
when he saw her, and went straight up to her. 

"my friend," said he, "you are the first [[person]] whom i have met with
in this [[country]]; i salute you, therefore, and beg you to be will disposed
towards me. [[protect]] these my goods [[good]], and myself too, for i embrace
your knees and [[pray]] to you as though you were a [[god]]. tell me, then,
and tell me truly, what [[land]] and [[country]] is this? who are its inhabitants?
am i on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?"

minerva answered, "stranger, you must be very simple, or must have
come from somewhere a long way off, not to [[know]] what [[country]] this
is. it is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows [[know]] it east and
west. it is rugged and not a [[good]] driving [[country]], but it is by no
means a bid island for what there is of it. it grows any quantity
of corn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it
breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds [[kind]] of timber grow here, and there
are watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name
of ithaca is known even as far as troy, which i [[understand]] to be a
long way off from this achaean [[country]]." 

ulysses was glad at finding himself, as minerva told him, in his own
country, and he began to [[answer]], but he did not speak the [[truth]], and
made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his [[heart]].

"i heard of ithaca," said he, "when i was in crete beyond the seas,
and now it seems i have reached it with all these treasures. i have
left as much more behind me for my [[children]], but am flying because
i killed orsilochus [[son]] of idomeneus, the fleetest runner in crete.
i killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils i had got from
troy with so much trouble and danger both on the field of [[battle]] and
by the waves of the weary sea; he said i had not served his father
loyally at troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent
ruler, so i lay in wait for him and with one of my followers by the
road side, and speared him as he was coming into town from the [[country]].
my it was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore,
that i had killed him, but as soon as i had done so i went to a ship
and besought the owners, who were phoenicians, to take me on board
and set me in pylos or in elis where the epeans [[rule]], giving them
as much spoil as satisfied them. they meant no guile, but the wind
drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither
by night. it was all we could do to get inside the harbour, and none
of us said a word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all
went on shore and lay down just as we were. i was very tired and fell
asleep directly, so they took my goods [[good]] out of the ship, and placed
them beside me where i was lying upon the sand. then they sailed away
to sidonia, and i was left here in [[great]] distress of [[mind]]."

such was his story, but minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand.
then she took the form of a woman, [[fair]], stately, and [[wise]], "he must
be indeed a shifty lying fellow," said she, "who could surpass you
in all manner of craft even though you had a [[god]] for your antagonist.
dare-devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can
you not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now
that you are in your own [[country]] again? we will say no more, however,
about this, for we can both of us [[deceive]] upon occasion- you are the
most accomplished counsellor and orator among all [[mankind]], while i
for diplomacy and subtlety have no [[equal]] among the gods. did you not
know jove's [[daughter]] minerva- me, who have been ever with you, who
kept watch over you in all your troubles, and who made the phaeacians
take so [[great]] a liking to you? and now, again, i am come here to talk
things over with you, and [[help]] you to hide the treasure i made the
phaeacians give you; i want to tell you about the troubles that await
you in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell no one,
neither [[man]] nor woman, that you have come [[home]] again. bear everything,
and put up with every man's [[man]] insolence, without a word." 

and [[ulysses]] answered, "a [[man]], [[goddess]], may [[know]] a [[great]] deal, but
you are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets
you it is a hard matter for him to [[know]] whether it is you or not.
this much, however, i [[know]] exceedingly well; you were very [[kind]] to
me as long as we achaeans were fighting before troy, but from the
day on which we went on board ship after having sacked the [[city]] of
priam, and [[heaven]] dispersed us- from that day, minerva, i saw no more
of you, and cannot ever [[remember]] your coming to my ship to [[help]] me
in a difficulty; i had to wander on sick and [[sorry]] till the gods delivered
me from [[evil]] and i reached the [[city]] of the phaeacians, where you encouraged
me and took me into the town. and now, i beseech you in your father's
name, tell me the [[truth]], for i do not [[believe]] i am really back in
ithaca. i am in some other [[country]] and you are mocking me and deceiving
me in all you have been saying. tell me then truly, have i really
got back to my own [[country]]?" 

"you are always taking something of that sort into your head," replied
minerva, "and that is why i cannot desert you in your afflictions;
you are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. any one but yourself on returning
from so long a [[voyage]] would at once have gone [[home]] to see his wife
and [[children]], but you do not seem to [[care]] about asking after them
or hearing any news about them till you have exploited your [[wife]],
who remains at [[home]] vainly grieving for you, and having no [[peace]] night
or day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. as for my not coming
near you, i was never uneasy about you, for i was [[certain]] you would
get back safely though you would lose all your [[men]], and i did not
wish to quarrel with my uncle [[neptune]], who never forgave you for having
blinded his [[son]]. i will now, however, point out to you the [[lie]] of
the [[land]], and you will then perhaps [[believe]] me. this is the haven
of the old merman phorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at
the head of it; [near it is the cave [[sacred]] to the naiads;] here too
is the overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable
hecatomb to the nymphs [[nymph]], and this is the wooded mountain neritum."

as she spoke the [[goddess]] dispersed the mist and the [[land]] appeared.
then [[ulysses]] rejoiced at finding himself again in his own [[land]], and
kissed the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the
nymphs, saying, "naiad nymphs [[nymph]], daughters [[daughter]] of jove, i made sure that
i was never again to see you, now therefore i greet you with all loving
salutations, and i will bring you offerings as in the old days, if
jove's redoubtable [[daughter]] will grant me [[life]], and bring my [[son]] to
manhood." 

"take [[heart]], and do not trouble yourself about that," rejoined minerva,
"let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave,
where they will be quite safe. let us see how we can [[best]] manage it
all." 

therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding
places, while [[ulysses]] brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze,
and [[good]] clothing which the phaecians had given him. they stowed everything
carefully away, and minerva set a stone against the door of the cave.
then the two sat down by the root of the [[great]] olive, and consulted
how to compass the destruction of the wicked suitors. 

"ulysses," said minerva, "noble [[son]] of laertes, [[think]] how you can
lay hands on these disreputable [[people]] who have been lording it in
your house these three years, courting your [[wife]] and making wedding
presents to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving
hope and sending your encouraging messages to every one of them, but
meaning the very opposite of all she says' 

and [[ulysses]] answered, "in [[good]] [[truth]], [[goddess]], it seems i should have
come to much the same [[bad]] end in my own house as [[agamemnon]] did, if
you had not given me such timely information. advise me how i shall
best avenge myself. stand by my side and put your [[courage]] into my
heart as on the day when we loosed troy's [[fair]] diadem from her brow.
help me now as you did then, and i will [[fight]] three hundred [[men]], if
you, [[goddess]], will be with me." 

"trust me for that," said she, "i will not lose sight of you when
once we set about it, and i would imagine that some of those who are
devouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their
blood and brains. i will begin by disguising you so that no human
being shall [[know]] you; i will cover your [[body]] with wrinkles; you shall
lose all your yellow hair; i will clothe you in a garment that shall
fill all who see it with loathing; i will blear your fine [[eyes]] for
you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors,
of your [[wife]], and of the [[son]] whom you left behind you. then go at
once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been always
well affected towards you, and is devoted to penelope and your [[son]];
you will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is called raven
by the fountain arethusa, where they are fattening on beechmast and
spring water after their manner. stay with him and find out how things
are going, while i proceed to sparta and see your [[son]], who is with
menelaus at lacedaemon, where he has gone to try and find out whether
you are still alive." 

"but why," said [[ulysses]], "did you not tell him, for you knew all about
it? did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds [[kind]] of hardship
while others are eating up his estate?" 

minerva answered, "never [[mind]] about him, i sent him that he might
be well spoken of for having gone. he is in no sort of difficulty,
but is staying quite comfortably with menelaus, and is surrounded
with abundance of every [[kind]]. the suitors have put out to sea and
are lying in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can
get [[home]]. i do not much [[think]] they will succeed, but rather that some
of those who are now eating up your estate will first find a grave
themselves." 

as she spoke minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with
wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over
his whole [[body]]; she bleared his [[eyes]], which were naturally very fine
ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about
him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also
gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished
him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for
him to sling it over his shoulder. 

when the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess
went straight to lacedaemon to fetch telemachus. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book xiv

ulysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the
wooded [[country]] and over the crest of the mountain till he reached
the place where minerva had said that he would find the swineherd,
who was the most thrifty servant he had. he found him sitting in front
of his hut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which
could be seen from far. he had made them spacious and [[fair]] to see,
with a [[free]] ran for the pigs all round them; he had built them during
his master's absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,
without saying anything to penelope or laertes, and he had fenced
them on top with thorn bushes. outside the yard he had run a strong
fence of oaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while
inside [[lie]] had built twelve sties near one another for the sows to
lie in. there were fifty pigs wallowing in each sty, all of them breeding
sows; but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for
the suitors kept on eating them, and [[die]] swineherd had to send them
the [[best]] he had continually. there were three hundred and sixty boar
pigs, and the herdsman's four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves,
slept always with them. the swineherd was at that moment cutting out
a pair of sandals from a [[good]] stout ox hide. three of his [[men]] were
out herding the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the
fourth to town with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors
that they might [[sacrifice]] it and have their fill of meat.

when the hounds saw [[ulysses]] they set up a furious barking and flew
at him, but [[ulysses]] was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold
of the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn
by them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox
hide, rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the
dogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them. then he said to
ulysses, "old [[man]], the dogs were likely to have made short [[work]] of
you, and then you would have got me into trouble. the gods have given
me quite enough worries without that, for i have lost the [[best]] of
masters, and am in continual [[grief]] on his account. i have to attend
swine for other [[people]] to [[eat]], while he, if he yet lives [[life]] to see the
light of day, is starving in some distant [[land]]. but come inside, and
when you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me where you come
from, and all about your misfortunes." 

on this the swineherd [[led]] the way into the hut and bade him sit down.
he strewed a [[good]] thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top
of this he threw the shaggy chamois skin- a [[great]] thick one- on which
he used to sleep by night. [[ulysses]] was pleased at being made thus
welcome, and said "may jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you
your heart's [[desire]] in return for the [[kind]] way in which you have received
me." 

to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "stranger, though a still
poorer [[man]] should come here, it would not be [[right]] for me to insult
him, for all strangers and beggars are from jove. you must take what
you can get and be thankful, for servants [[live]] in [[fear]] when they have
young lords [[lord]] for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for
heaven has hindered the return of him who would have been always good
to me and given me something of my own- a house, a piece of [[land]],
a [[good]] looking [[wife]], and all else that a liberal master allows a servant
who has worked hard for him, and whose [[labour]] the gods have prospered
as they have mine in the situation which i hold. if my master had
grown old here he would have done [[great]] things by me, but he is gone,
and i [[wish]] that helen's whole [[race]] were utterly destroyed, for she
has been the [[death]] of many a [[good]] [[man]]. it was this matter that took
my master to ilius, the [[land]] of [[noble]] steeds, to [[fight]] the trojans
in the cause of kin [[agamemnon]]." 

as he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the sties where
the [[young]] sucking pigs were penned. he picked out two which he brought
back with him and sacrificed. he singed them, cut them up, and spitted
on them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it
before [[ulysses]], hot and still on the spit, whereon [[ulysses]] sprinkled
it over with [[white]] barley meal. the swineherd then mixed wine in a
bowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite [[ulysses]] told him to begin.

"fall to, stranger," said he, "on a dish of servant's pork. the fat
pigs have to go to the suitors, who [[eat]] them up without shame or scruple;
but the blessed gods [[love]] not such shameful doings, and [[respect]] those
who do what is lawful and [[right]]. even the fierce free-booters who
go raiding on other people's [[land]], and jove gives them their spoil-
even they, when they have filled their ships and got [[home]] again live
conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but some god
seems to have told these [[people]] that [[ulysses]] is [[dead]] and gone; they
will not, therefore, go back to their own homes [[home]] and make their offers
of [[marriage]] in the usual way, but waste his estate by [[force]], without
fear or stint. not a day or night comes out of [[heaven]], but they sacrifice
not one victim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for
he was exceedingly [[rich]]. no other [[great]] [[man]] either in ithaca or on
the mainland is as [[rich]] as he was; he had as much as twenty [[men]] put
together. i will tell you what he had. there are twelve herds of cattle
upon the mainland, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also twelve
droves of pigs, while his own [[men]] and hired strangers feed him twelve
widely spreading herds of goats. here in ithaca he runs even large
flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in the
charge of excellent goatherds. each one of these sends the suitors
the [[best]] goat in the flock every day. as for myself, i am in charge
of the pigs that you see here, and i have to keep picking out the
best i have and sending it to them." 

this was his story, but [[ulysses]] went on eating and drinking ravenously
without a word, brooding his [[revenge]]. when he had eaten enough and
was satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,
filled it with wine, and gave it to [[ulysses]], who was pleased, and
said as he took it in his hands, "my friend, who was this master of
yours that bought you and paid for you, so [[rich]] and so powerful as
you tell me? you say he perished in the cause of [[king]] [[agamemnon]]; tell
me who he was, in case i may have met with such a [[person]]. jove and
the other gods [[know]], but i may be able to give you news of him, for
i have travelled much." 

eumaeus answered, "old [[man]], no traveller who comes here with news
will get ulysses' [[wife]] and [[son]] to [[believe]] his story. nevertheless,
tramps in want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of
lies, and not a word of [[truth]]; every one who finds his way to ithaca
goes to my mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them
in, makes much of them, and asks them all manner of questions [[question]], crying
all the [[time]] as [[women]] will when they have lost their husbands. and
you too, old [[man]], for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up
a very pretty story. but the wolves and birds of prey have long since
torn [[ulysses]] to pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and
his bones are lying buried deep in sand upon some [[foreign]] shore; he
is [[dead]] and gone, and a [[bad]] [[business]] it is for all his friends- for
me especially; go where i may i shall never find so [[good]] a master,
not even if i were to go [[home]] to my [[mother]] and [[father]] where i was
bred and born. i do not so much [[care]], however, about my parents now,
though i should dearly like to see them again in my own [[country]]; it
is the loss of [[ulysses]] that grieves me most; i cannot speak of him
without reverence though he is here no longer, for he was very fond
of me, and took such [[care]] of me that whereever he may be i shall always
honour his memory." 

"my friend," replied [[ulysses]], "you are very positive, and very hard
of [[belief]] about your master's coming [[home]] again, nevertheless i will
not merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. do not give me
anything for my news till he has actually come, you may then give
me a shirt and cloak of [[good]] wear if you will. i am in [[great]] want,
but i will not take anything at all till then, for i hate a [[man]], even
as i hate hell [[fire]], who lets his [[poverty]] tempt him into lying. i
swear by [[king]] jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth
of [[ulysses]] to which i have now come, that all will surely happen as
i have said it will. [[ulysses]] will return in this [[self]] same year; with
the end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here
to do vengeance on all those who are ill treating his [[wife]] and [[son]]."

to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "old [[man]], you will neither
get paid for bringing [[good]] news, nor will [[ulysses]] ever come [[home]];
drink you wine in [[peace]], and let us talk about something else. do
not keep on reminding me of all this; it always pains [[pain]] me when any
one speaks about my honoured master. as for your oath we will let
it alone, but i only [[wish]] he may come, as do penelope, his old father
laertes, and his [[son]] telemachus. i am terribly unhappy too about this
same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare
to be no worse [[man]], face and figure, than his [[father]], but some one,
either [[god]] or [[man]], has been unsettling his [[mind]], so he has gone off
to pylos to try and get news of his [[father]], and the suitors are lying
in wait for him as he is coming [[home]], in the [[hope]] of leaving the house
of arceisius without a name in ithaca. but let us say no more about
him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape if the [[son]] of saturn
holds his hand over him to [[protect]] him. and now, old [[man]], tell me
your own story; tell me also, for i want to [[know]], who you are and
where you come from. tell me of your town and parents, what manner
of ship you came in, how crew brought you to ithaca, and from what
country they professed to come- for you cannot have come by [[land]]."

and [[ulysses]] answered, "i will tell you all about it. if there were
meat and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing
to do but to [[eat]] and drink while the others go to their [[work]], i could
easily talk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the
story of the sorrows [[sorrow]] with which it has pleased [[heaven]] to visit me.

"i am by birth a cretan; my [[father]] was a well-to-do [[man]], who had many
sons born in [[marriage]], whereas i was the [[son]] of a [[slave]] whom he had
purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my [[father]] castor [[son]] of hylax
(whose lineage i claim, and who was held in the highest [[honour]] among
the cretans for his [[wealth]], [[prosperity]], and the valour of his sons)
put me on the same level with my brothers [[brother]] who had been born in wedlock.
when, however, [[death]] took him to the house of [[hades]], his sons [[son]] divided
his estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding
and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to [[marry]] into
a [[rich]] [[family]], for i was not given to bragging, or shirking on the
field of [[battle]]. it is all over now; still, if you look at the straw
you can see what the ear was, for i have had trouble enough and to
spare. [[mars]] and minerva made me doughty in [[war]]; when i had picked
my [[men]] to surprise the [[enemy]] with an ambuscade i never gave death
so much as a [[thought]], but was the first to leap forward and spear
all whom i could overtake. such was i in [[battle]], but i did not care
about farm [[work]], nor the frugal [[home]] [[life]] of those who would bring
up [[children]]. my delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows-
things that most [[men]] shudder to [[think]] of; but one [[man]] likes one thing
and another another, and this was what i was most naturally inclined
to. before the achaeans went to troy, nine times [[time]] was i in command
of [[men]] and ships on [[foreign]] service, and i amassed much [[wealth]]. i
had my pick of the spoil in the first instance, and much more was
allotted to me later on. 

"my house grew apace and i became a [[great]] [[man]] among the cretans, but
when jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many perished,
the [[people]] required me and idomeneus to lead their ships to troy,
and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing so.
there we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked the
city of priam and sailed [[home]] again as [[heaven]] dispersed us. then it
was that jove devised [[evil]] against me. i spent but one month happily
with my [[children]], [[wife]], and [[property]], and then i conceived the idea
of making a descent on [[egypt]], so i fitted out a fine fleet and manned
it. i had nine ships, and the [[people]] flocked to fill them. for six
days i and my [[men]] made feast, and i found them many victims both for
sacrifice to the gods and for themselves, but on the seventh day we
went on board and set sail from crete with a [[fair]] north wind behind
us though we were going down a river. nothing went ill with any of
our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but sat where we were
and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. on the fifth
day we reached the river aegyptus; there i stationed my ships in the
river, bidding my [[men]] stay by them and keep guard over them while
i sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.

"but the [[men]] disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged
the [[land]] of the [[egyptians]], killing the [[men]], and taking their wives
and [[children]] captive. the alarm was soon carried to the [[city]], and
when they heard the [[war]] cry, the [[people]] came out at daybreak till
the plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the
gleam of armour. then jove spread panic among my [[men]], and they would
no longer face the [[enemy]], for they found themselves surrounded. the
egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced
labour for them. jove, however, put it in my [[mind]] to do thus- and
i [[wish]] i had died then and there in [[egypt]] instead, for there was much
sorrow in store for me- i took off my helmet and shield and dropped
my spear from my hand; then i went straight up to the king's chariot,
clasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared my [[life]], bade
me get into his chariot, and took me weeping to his own [[home]]. many
made at me with their ashen spears and tried to kil me in their fury,
but the [[king]] protected me, for he feared the wrath of jove the protector
of strangers, who punishes those who do [[evil]]. 

"i stayed there for seven years and got together much [[money]] among
the [[egyptians]], for they all gave me something; but when it was now
going on for eight years there came a [[certain]] phoenician, a cunning
rascal, who had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this
man talked me over into going with him to phoenicia, where his house
and his possessions lay. i stayed there for a whole twelve months,
but at the end of that [[time]] when months and days had gone by till
the same season had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound
for libya, on a pretence that i was to take a cargo along with him
to that place, but really that he might sell me as a [[slave]] and take
the [[money]] i fetched. i suspected his intention, but went on board
with him, for i could not [[help]] it. 

"the ship ran before a fresh north wind till we had reached the sea
that lies [[lie]] between crete and libya; there, however, jove counselled
their destruction, for as soon as we were well out from crete and
could see nothing but sea and [[sky]], he raised a black cloud over our
ship and the sea grew dark beneath it. then jove let fly with his
thunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was filled with
fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. the [[men]] fell all into
the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking
like so many sea-gulls, but the [[god]] presently deprived them of all
chance of getting [[home]] again. i was all dismayed; jove, however, sent
the ship's mast within my reach, which saved my [[life]], for i clung
to it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. nine days did i drift
but in the darkness of the tenth night a [[great]] wave bore me on to
the thesprotian coast. there pheidon [[king]] of the thesprotians entertained
me hospitably without charging me anything at all for his [[son]] found
me when i was nearly [[dead]] with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised
me by the hand, took me to his father's house and gave me clothes
to wear. 

"there it was that i heard news of [[ulysses]], for the [[king]] told me he
had entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on
his homeward [[journey]]. he showed me also the treasure of gold, and
wrought iron that [[ulysses]] had got together. there was enough to keep
his [[family]] for ten generations [[generation]], so much had he left in the house of
king pheidon. but the [[king]] said [[ulysses]] had gone to dodona that he
might learn jove's [[mind]] from the god's high oak tree, and [[know]] whether
after so long an absence he should return to ithaca openly, or in
secret. moreover the [[king]] swore in my presence, making drink-offerings
in his own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side,
and the crew found, that should take him to his own [[country]]. he sent
me off however before [[ulysses]] returned, for there happened to be a
thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of dulichium,
and he told those in charge of her to be sure and take me safely to
king acastus. 

"these [[men]] hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to
the very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out
from [[land]] they resolved on selling me as a [[slave]]. they stripped me
of the shirt and cloak that i was wearing, and gave me instead the
tattered old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall,
they reached the tilled lands [[land]] of ithaca, and there they bound me with
a [[strong]] rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore to get supper
by the sea side. but the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having
drawn my rags over my head i slid down the rudder into the sea, where
i struck out and swam till i was well clear of them, and came ashore
near a thick wood in which i lay concealed. they were very angry at
my having escaped and went searching about for me, till at [[last]] they
thought it was no further use and went back to their ship. the gods,
having hidden me thus easily, then took me to a [[good]] man's [[man]] door- for
it seems that i am not to [[die]] yet awhile." 

to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "poor unhappy stranger,
i have found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting,
but that part about [[ulysses]] is not [[right]]; and you will never get me
to [[believe]] it. why should a [[man]] like you go about telling lies [[lie]] in
this way? i [[know]] all about the return of my master. the gods one and
all of them detest him, or they would have taken him before troy,
or let him [[die]] with [[friends]] around him when the days of his fighting
were done; for then the achaeans would have built a mound over his
ashes and his [[son]] would have been heir to his renown, but now the
storm winds have spirited him away we [[know]] not whither. 

"as for me i [[live]] out of the way here with the pigs, and never go
to the town unless when penelope sends for me on the arrival of some
news about [[ulysses]]. then they all sit round and ask questions [[question]], both
those who grieve over the king's absence, and those who rejoice at
it because they can [[eat]] up his [[property]] without paying for it. for
my own part i have never cared about asking anyone else since the
time when i was taken in by an aetolian, who had killed a [[man]] and
come a long way till at [[last]] he reached my station, and i was very
kind to him. he said he had seen [[ulysses]] with idomeneus among the
cretans, refitting his ships which had been damaged in a gale. he
said [[ulysses]] would return in the following summer or autumn with his
men, and that he would bring back much [[wealth]]. and now you, you unfortunate
old [[man]], since [[fate]] has brought you to my door, do not try to flatter
me in this way with [[vain]] hopes [[hope]]. it is not for any such [[reason]] that
i shall treat you kindly, but only out of [[respect]] for jove the god
of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you." 

ulysses answered, "i see that you are of an unbelieving [[mind]]; i have
given you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make
a bargain, and call all the gods in [[heaven]] to witness it. if your
master comes [[home]], give me a cloak and shirt of [[good]] wear, and send
me to dulichium where i want to go; but if he does not come as i say
he will, set your [[men]] on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder
precepice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the [[country]] telling
lies." 

"and a pretty figure i should cut then," replied eumaeus, both now
and hereafter, if i were to kill you after receiving you into my hut
and showing you hospitality. i should have to say my prayers in good
earnest if i did; but it is just supper [[time]] and i [[hope]] my [[men]] will
come in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper."

thus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with
the pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their sties, and
a tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them.
but eumaeus called to his [[men]] and said, "bring in the [[best]] pig you
have, that i may [[sacrifice]] for this stranger, and we will take toll
of him ourselves. we have had trouble enough this long [[time]] feeding
pigs, while others reap the fruit of our [[labour]]." 

on this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a
fine fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. eumaeus
did not forget the gods, for he was a [[man]] of [[good]] principles [[principle]], so the
first thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig's face and throw
them into the [[fire]], praying to all the gods as he did so that ulysses
might return [[home]] again. then he clubbed the pig with a billet of
oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and
stunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. then they
cut it up, and eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint
on to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid
upon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces
upon the spits and roasted them till they were done; when they had
taken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser in a heap.
the swineherd, who was a most equitable [[man]], then stood up to give
every one his share. he made seven portions; one of these he set apart
for mercury the [[son]] of maia and the nymphs [[nymph]], praying to them as he
did so; the others he dealt out to the [[men]] [[man]] by [[man]]. he gave ulysses
some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial [[honour]],
and [[ulysses]] was much pleased. "i [[hope]], eumaeus," said he, "that jove
will be as well disposed towards you as i am, for the [[respect]] you
are showing to an outcast like myself." 

to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "eat, my [[good]] fellow, and
enjoy your supper, such as it is. [[god]] grants this, and withholds that,
just as he thinks [[think]] [[right]], for he can do whatever he chooses."

as he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice
to the [[immortal]] gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put the
cup in the hands of [[ulysses]], and sat down to his own portion. mesaulius
brought them their bread; the swineherd had bought this [[man]] on his
own account from among the taphians during his master's absence, and
had paid for him with his own [[money]] without saying anything either
to his mistress or laertes. they then laid their hands upon the good
things that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat
and drink, mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they
all went to bed after having made a hearty supper. 

now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon.
it poured without ceasing, and the wind blew [[strong]] from the west,
which is a wet quarter, so [[ulysses]] [[thought]] he would see whether eumaeus,
in the excellent [[care]] he took of him, would take off his own cloak
and give it him, or make one of his [[men]] give him one. "listen to me,"
said he, "eumaeus and the rest of you; when i have said a prayer i
will tell you something. it is the wine that makes me talk in this
way; wine will make even a [[wise]] [[man]] fall to singing; it will make
him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had [[better]] leave
unspoken; still, as i have begun, i will go on. would that i were
still [[young]] and [[strong]] as when we got up an ambuscade before troy.
menelaus and [[ulysses]] were the leaders, but i was in command also,
for the other two would have it so. when we had come up to the wall
of the [[city]] we crouched down beneath our armour and lay there under
cover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew about the swamp.
it came on to freeze with a north wind blowing; the snow fell small
and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick with rime.
the others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough
with their shields about their shoulders, but i had carelessly left
my cloak behind me, not thinking that i should be too cold, and had
gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. when the night was two-thirds
through and the stars had shifted their their places, i nudged ulysses
who was close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me his ear.

"'ulysses,' said i, 'this cold will be the [[death]] of me, for i have
no cloak; some [[god]] fooled me into setting off with nothing on but
my shirt, and i do not [[know]] what to do.' 

"ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following
plan: 

"'keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hear you.'
then he raised his head on his elbow. 

"'my [[friends]],' said he, 'i have had a [[dream]] from [[heaven]] in my sleep.
we are a long way from the ships; i [[wish]] some one would go down and
tell [[agamemnon]] to send us up more [[men]] at once.' 

"on this thoas [[son]] of andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running
to the ships, whereon i took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough
till morning. would that i were still [[young]] and [[strong]] as i was in
those days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak
both out of [[good]] will and for the [[respect]] due to a brave soldier;
but now [[people]] look down upon me because my clothes are shabby."

and eumaeus answered, "old [[man]], you have told us an excellent story,
and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the
present, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else
that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning
you have to shake your own old rags about your [[body]] again, for we
have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every [[man]] has only
one. when ulysses' [[son]] comes [[home]] again he will give you both cloak
and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go." 

with this he got up and made a bed for [[ulysses]] by throwing some goatskins
and sheepskins on the ground in front of the [[fire]]. here [[ulysses]] lay
down, and eumaeus covered him over with a [[great]] heavy cloak that he
kept for a [[change]] in case of extraordinarily [[bad]] weather.

thus did [[ulysses]] sleep, and the [[young]] [[men]] slept beside him. but the
swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready
to go and [[ulysses]] was glad to see that he looked after his property
during his master's absence. first he slung his [[sword]] over his brawny
shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. he also took
the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of attack
from [[men]] or dogs. thus equipped he went to his rest where the pigs
were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from
the north wind.

book xv

but minerva went to the [[fair]] [[city]] of lacedaemon to tell ulysses'
son that he was to return at once. she found him and pisistratus sleeping
in the forecourt of menelaus's house; pisistratus was fast asleep,
but telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy
father, so minerva went close up to him and said: 

"telemachus, you should not remain so far away from [[home]] any longer,
nor leave your [[property]] with such dangerous [[people]] in your house;
they will [[eat]] up everything you have among them, and you will have
been on a fool's errand. ask menelaus to send you [[home]] at once if
you [[wish]] to find your excellent [[mother]] still there when you get back.
her [[father]] and brothers [[brother]] are already urging her to [[marry]] eurymachus,
who has given her more than any of the others, and has been greatly
increasing his wedding presents [[present]]. i [[hope]] nothing valuable may have
been taken from the house in spite of you, but you [[know]] what women
are- they always want to do the [[best]] they can for the [[man]] who marries
them, and never give another [[thought]] to the [[children]] of their first
husband, nor to their [[father]] either when he is [[dead]] and done with.
go [[home]], therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable
woman servant that you have, until it shall please [[heaven]] to send
you a [[wife]] of your own. let me tell you also of another matter which
you had [[better]] attend to. the [[chief]] [[men]] among the suitors are lying
in wait for you in the strait between ithaca and samos, and they mean
to kill you before you can reach [[home]]. i do not much [[think]] they will
succeed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up
your [[property]] will find a grave themselves. sail night and day, and
keep your ship well away from the islands; the [[god]] who watches over
you and protects you will send you a [[fair]] wind. as soon as you get
to ithaca send your ship and [[men]] on to the town, but yourself go straight
to the swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is well disposed towards
you, stay with him, therefore, for the night, and then send him to
penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from pylos."

then she went back to [[olympus]]; but telemachus stirred pisistratus
with his heel to rouse him, and said, "wake up pisistratus, and yoke
the horses to the chariot, for we must set off [[home]]." 

but pisistratus said, "no matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive
in the dark. it will be morning soon; wait till menelaus has brought
his presents [[present]] and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good-bye
to us in the usual way. so long as he lives [[life]] a guest should never forget
a host who has shown him [[kindness]]." 

as he spoke day began to break, and menelaus, who had already risen,
leaving helen in bed, came towards them. when telemachus saw him he
put on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a [[great]] cloak over his
shoulders, and went out to meet him. "menelaus," said he, "let me
go back now to my own [[country]], for i want to get [[home]]." 

and menelaus answered, "telemachus, if you insist on going i will
not detain you. not like to see a host either too fond of his guest
or too rude to him. moderation is [[best]] in all things, and not letting
a [[man]] go when he wants to do so is as [[bad]] as telling him to go if
he would like to stay. one should treat a guest well as long as he
is in the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. wait, then,
till i can get your beautiful presents [[present]] into your chariot, and till
you have yourself seen them. i will tell the [[women]] to prepare a sufficient
dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once
more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting
out on such a long [[journey]]. if, moreover, you have a fancy for making
a tour in hellas or in the peloponnese, i will yoke my horses, and
will conduct you myself through all our principal cities [[city]]. no one will
send us away empty handed; every one will give us something- a bronze
tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup." 

"menelaus," replied telemachus, "i want to go [[home]] at once, for when
i came away i left my [[property]] without protection, and [[fear]] that while
looking for my [[father]] i shall come to ruin myself, or find that something
valuable has been stolen during my absence." 

when menelaus heard this he immediately told his [[wife]] and servants
to prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house.
at this moment eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had
just got up; so menelaus told him to [[light]] the [[fire]] and cook some
meat, which he at once did. then menelaus went down into his fragrant
store room, not alone, but helen went too, with megapenthes. when
he reached the place where the treasures of his house were kept, he
selected a double cup, and told his [[son]] megapenthes to bring also
a silver mixing-bowl. meanwhile helen went to the chest where she
kept the lovely dresses which she had made with her own hands, and
took out one that was largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery;
it glittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest.
then they all came back through the house again till they got to telemachus,
and menelaus said, "telemachus, may jove, the mighty husband of juno,
bring you safely [[home]] according to your [[desire]]. i will now present
you with the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house.
it is a mixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid
with gold, and it is the [[work]] of vulcan. phaedimus [[king]] of the sidonians
made me a [[present]] of it in the course of a visit that i paid him while
i was on my return [[home]]. i should like to give it to you."

with these words he placed the double cup in the hands of telemachus,
while megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl and set it before
him. hard by stood lovely helen with the robe ready in her hand.

"i too, my [[son]]," said she, "have something for you as a keepsake from
the hand of helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day.
till then, get your dear [[mother]] to keep it for you; thus may you go
back rejoicing to your own [[country]] and to your [[home]]." 

so saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly.
then pisistratus put the presents [[present]] into the chariot, and admired them
all as he did so. presently menelaus took telemachus and pisistratus
into the house, and they both of them sat down to table. a maid servant
brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into
a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean
table beside them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered
them many [[good]] things of what there was in the house. eteoneus carved
the meat and gave them each their portions, while megapenthes poured
out the wine. then they laid their hands upon the [[good]] things that
were before them, but as soon as they had had had enough to [[eat]] and
drink telemachus and pisistratus yoked the horses, and took their
places in the chariot. they drove out through the inner gateway and
under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, and menelaus came
after them with a golden goblet of wine in his [[right]] hand that they
might make a drink-offering before they set out. he stood in front
of the horses and pledged them, saying, "farewell to both of you;
see that you tell nestor how i have treated you, for he was as kind
to me as any [[father]] could be while we achaeans were fighting before
troy." 

"we will be sure, sir," answered telemachus, "to tell him everything
as soon as we see him. i [[wish]] i were as [[certain]] of finding ulysses
returned when i get back to ithaca, that i might tell him of the very
great [[kindness]] you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents
i am taking with me." 

as he was thus speaking a bird flew on his [[right]] hand- an eagle with
a [[great]] [[white]] goose in its talons which it had carried off from the
farm yard- and all the [[men]] and [[women]] were running after it and shouting.
it came quite close up to them and flew away on their [[right]] hands
in front of the horses. when they saw it they were glad, and their
hearts took comfort within them, whereon pisistratus said, "tell me,
menelaus, has [[heaven]] sent this omen for us or for you?" 

menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper [[answer]] for him
to make, but helen was too quick for him and said, "i will [[read]] this
matter as [[heaven]] has put it in my [[heart]], and as i [[doubt]] not that it
will come to pass. the eagle came from the mountain where it was bred
and has its nest, and in like manner [[ulysses]], after having travelled
far and [[suffered]] much, will return to take his revenge- if indeed
he is not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors."

"may jove so grant it," replied telemachus; "if it should prove to
be so, i will make vows to you as though you were a [[god]], even when
i am at [[home]]." 

as he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed
through the town towards the open [[country]]. they swayed the yoke upon
their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and
darkness was over all the [[land]]. then they reached pherae, where diocles
lived who was [[son]] of ortilochus, the [[son]] of alpheus. there they passed
the night and were treated hospitably. when the child of morning,
rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their
places in the chariot. they drove out through the inner gateway and
under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. then pisistratus lashed
his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came
to pylos, and then telemachus said: 

"pisistratus, i [[hope]] you will promise to do what i am going to ask
you. you [[know]] our fathers [[father]] were old [[friends]] before us; moreover, we
are both of an [[age]], and this [[journey]] has brought us together still
more closely; do not, therefore, take me [[past]] my ship, but leave me
there, for if i go to your father's house he will try to keep me in
the warmth of his [[good]] will towards me, and i must go [[home]] at once."

pisistratus [[thought]] how he should do as he was [[asked]], and in the end
he deemed it [[best]] to turn his horses towards the ship, and put menelaus's
beautiful presents [[present]] of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel.
then he said, "go on board at once and tell your [[men]] to do so also
before i can reach [[home]] to tell my [[father]]. i [[know]] how obstinate he
is, and am sure he will not let you go; he will come down here to
fetch you, and he will not go back without you. but he will be very
angry." 

with this he drove his goodly steeds back to the [[city]] of the pylians
and soon reached his [[home]], but telemachus called the [[men]] together
and gave his orders. "now, my [[men]]," said he, "get everything in order
on board the ship, and let us set out [[home]]." 

thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. but
as telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to minerva
in the ship's stern, there came to him a [[man]] from a distant [[country]],
a seer, who was flying from argos because he had killed a [[man]]. he
was descended from melampus, who used to [[live]] in pylos, the [[land]] of
sheep; he was [[rich]] and owned a [[great]] house, but he was driven into
exile by the [[great]] and powerful [[king]] neleus. neleus seized his goods
and held them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner
in the house of [[king]] phylacus, and in much distress of [[mind]] both on
account of the [[daughter]] of neleus and because he was haunted by a
great [[sorrow]] that dread erinyes had laid upon him. in the end, however,
he escaped with his [[life]], drove the cattle from phylace to pylos,
avenged the [[wrong]] that had been done him, and gave the [[daughter]] of
neleus to his [[brother]]. then he left the [[country]] and went to argos,
where it was ordained that he should reign over much [[people]]. there
he [[married]], established himself, and had two famous sons [[son]] antiphates
and mantius. antiphates became [[father]] of oicleus, and oicleus of amphiaraus,
who was dearly loved both by jove and by [[apollo]], but he did not live
to old [[age]], for he was killed in thebes by [[reason]] of a woman's gifts.
his sons [[son]] were alcmaeon and amphilochus. mantius, the other [[son]] of
melampus, was [[father]] to polypheides and cleitus. aurora, throned in
gold, carried off cleitus for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell
among the immortals [[immortal]], but [[apollo]] made polypheides the [[greatest]] seer
in the whole [[world]] now that amphiaraus was [[dead]]. he quarrelled with
his [[father]] and went to [[live]] in hyperesia, where he remained and prophesied
for all [[men]]. 

his [[son]], theoclymenus, it was who now came up to telemachus as he
was making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. "friend'" said
he, "now that i find you sacrificing in this place, i beseech you
by your sacrifices [[sacrifice]] themselves, and by the [[god]] to whom you make them,
i [[pray]] you also by your own head and by those of your followers, tell
me the [[truth]] and nothing but the [[truth]]. who and whence are you? tell
me also of your town and parents." 

telemachus said, "i will [[answer]] you quite truly. i am from ithaca,
and my [[father]] is 'ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. but he
has come to some miserable end. therefore i have taken this ship and
got my crew together to see if i can hear any news of him, for he
has been away a long [[time]]." 

"i too," answered theoclymenus, am an [[exile]], for i have killed a man
of my own [[race]]. he has many brothers [[brother]] and kinsmen in argos, and they
have [[great]] [[power]] among the argives. i am flying to escape [[death]] at
their hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the
earth. i am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship
that they may not kill me, for i [[know]] they are in pursuit."

"i will not refuse you," replied telemachus, "if you [[wish]] to join
us. come, therefore, and in ithaca we will treat you hospitably according
to what we have." 

on this he received theoclymenus' spear and laid it down on the deck
of the ship. he went on board and sat in the stern, bidding theoclymenus
sit beside him; then the [[men]] let go the hawsers. telemachus told them
to catch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. they
set the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made
it fast with the forestays, and they hoisted their [[white]] sails with
sheets of twisted ox hide. minerva sent them a [[fair]] wind that blew
fresh and [[strong]] to take the ship on her course as fast as possible.
thus then they passed by crouni and chalcis. 

presently the sun set and darkness was over all the [[land]]. the vessel
made a quick pass sage to pheae and thence on to elis, where the epeans
rule. telemachus then headed her for the flying islands, wondering
within himself whether he should escape [[death]] or should be taken [[prisoner]].

meanwhile [[ulysses]] and the swineherd were eating their supper in the
hut, and the [[men]] supped with them. as soon as they had had to eat
and drink, [[ulysses]] began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether
he would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the
station or pack him off to the [[city]]; so he said: 

"eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow i want to go away and begin begging
about the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your [[men]].
give me your [[advice]] therefore, and let me have a [[good]] guide to go
with me and show me the way. i will go the round of the [[city]] begging
as i needs must, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece
of bread. i should like also to go to the house of [[ulysses]] and bring
news of her husband to queen penelope. i could then go about among
the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give me
a dinner. i should soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts
of ways. listen and [[believe]] when i tell you that by the blessing of
mercury who gives grace and [[good]] name to the works [[work]] of all [[men]], there
is no one living who would make a more handy servant than i should-
to put fresh wood on the [[fire]], chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine,
and do all those services that [[poor]] [[men]] have to do for their betters."

the swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. "heaven
help me," he exclaimed, "what ever can have put such a notion as that
into your head? if you go near the suitors you will be undone to a
certainty, for their [[pride]] and insolence reach the very heavens [[heaven]]. they
would never [[think]] of taking a [[man]] like you for a servant. their servants
are all [[young]] [[men]], well dressed, wearing [[good]] cloaks and shirts, with
well looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables are kept
quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. stay where
you are, then; you are not in anybody's way; i do not [[mind]] your being
here, no more do any of the others, and when telemachus comes home
he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you
want to go." 

ulysses answered, "i [[hope]] you may be as dear to the gods as you are
to me, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble;
there is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp; still,
when [[men]] have once got low down in the [[world]] they will go through
a [[great]] deal on behalf of their miserable bellies. since however you
press me to stay here and await the return of telemachus, tell about
ulysses' [[mother]], and his [[father]] whom he left on the threshold of old
age when he set out for troy. are they still living or are they already
dead and in the house of [[hades]]?" 

"i will tell you all about them," replied eumaeus, "laertes is still
living and prays [[heaven]] to let him depart peacefully his own house,
for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his [[son]], and also
about the [[death]] of his [[wife]], which [[grieved]] him greatly and aged him
more than anything else did. she came to an unhappy end through sorrow
for her [[son]]: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me
come to such an end as she did. as long as she was still living, though
she was always grieving, i used to like seeing her and asking her
how she did, for she brought me up along with her [[daughter]] ctimene,
the youngest of her [[children]]; we were boy and girl together, and she
made little difference between us. when, however, we both grew up,
they sent ctimene to same and received a splendid dowry for her. as
for me, my mistress gave me a [[good]] shirt and cloak with a pair of
sandals for my feet, and sent me off into the [[country]], but she was
just as fond of me as ever. this is all over now. still it has pleased
heaven to [[prosper]] my [[work]] in the situation which i now hold. i have
enough to [[eat]] and drink, and can find something for any respectable
stranger who comes here; but there is no getting a [[kind]] word or deed
out of my mistress, for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked
people. servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk
with her; they like to have something to [[eat]] and drink at the house,
and something too to take back with them into the [[country]]. this is
what will keep servants in a [[good]] [[humour]]." 

ulysses answered, "then you must have been a very little fellow, eumaeus,
when you were taken so far away from your [[home]] and parents. tell me,
and tell me true, was the [[city]] in which your [[father]] and [[mother]] lived
sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies [[enemy]] carry you off when you were
alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for
whatever your master gave them?" 

"stranger," replied eumaeus, "as regards your [[question]]: sit still,
make yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. the
nights are now at their longest; there is plenty of [[time]] both for
sleeping and sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed
till bed [[time]], too much sleep is as [[bad]] as too little; if any one
of the others wishes [[wish]] to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can
then take my master's pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning.
we two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one
another stories about our misfortunes; for when a [[man]] has suffered
much, and been buffeted about in the [[world]], he takes [[pleasure]] in recalling
the memory of sorrows [[sorrow]] that have long gone by. as regards your [[question]],
then, my tale is as follows: 

"you may have heard of an island called syra that lies [[lie]] over above
ortygia, where the [[land]] begins to turn round and look in another direction.
it is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is [[good]], with much pasture
fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine and wheat. dearth
never comes there, nor are the [[people]] plagued by any sickness, but
when they grow old [[apollo]] comes with diana and kills them with his
painless shafts. it contains two communities [[community]], and the whole country
is divided between these two. my [[father]] ctesius [[son]] of ormenus, a
man comparable to the gods, reigned over both. 

"now to this place there came some cunning traders from phoenicia
(for the phoenicians are [[great]] mariners) in a ship which they had
freighted with gewgaws of all kinds [[kind]]. there happened to be a phoenician
woman in my father's house, very tall and comely, and an excellent
servant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing
near their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman
can resist, no matter how [[good]] she may be by [[nature]]. the [[man]] who had
seduced her [[asked]] her who she was and where she came from, and on
this she told him her father's name. 'i come from sidon,' said she,
'and am [[daughter]] to arybas, a [[man]] rolling in [[wealth]]. one day as i
was coming into the town from the [[country]] some taphian pirates seized
me and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the [[man]] who
owns this house, and he gave them their price for me.' 

"the [[man]] who had seduced her then said, 'would you like to come along
with us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?
they are both alive and are said to be well off.' 

"'i will do so gladly,' answered she, 'if you [[men]] will first swear
me a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.'

"they all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their
oath the woman said, 'hush; and if any of your [[men]] meets me in the
street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for [[fear]] some one
should go and tell my master, in which case he would suspect something.
he would put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep
your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can,
and send me word when you have done loading. i will bring as much
gold as i can lay my hands on, and there is something else also that
i can do towards paying my fare. i am nurse to the [[son]] of the good
man of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. i
will carry him off in your ship, and you will get a [[great]] deal of
money for him if you take him and sell him in [[foreign]] parts.'

"on this she went back to the house. the phoenicians stayed a whole
year till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,
and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the
woman. their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father's
house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it;
and while my [[mother]] and the servants had it in their hands admiring
it and bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and
then went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led
me out of the house. in the fore part of the house she saw the tables
set with the cups of guests who had been feasting with my [[father]],
as being in attendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting
of the [[public]] assembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried
them off in the bosom of her dress, while i followed her, for i knew
no [[better]]. the sun was now set, and darkness was over all the [[land]],
so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour,
where the phoenician ship was lying. when they had got on board they
sailed their ways over the sea, taking us with them, and jove sent
then a [[fair]] wind; six days did we sail both night and day, but on
the seventh day diana struck the woman and she fell heavily down into
the ship's hold as though she were a sea gull alighting on the water;
so they threw her overboard to the seals and fishes, and i was left
all sorrowful and alone. presently the winds and waves took the ship
to ithaca, where laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and thus
it was that ever i came to set [[eyes]] upon this [[country]]." 

ulysses answered, "eumaeus, i have heard the story of your misfortunes
with the most lively interest and [[pity]], but jove has given you good
as well as [[evil]], for in spite of everything you have a [[good]] master,
who sees that you always have enough to [[eat]] and drink; and you lead
a [[good]] [[life]], whereas i am still going about begging my way from city
to [[city]]." 

thus did they converse, and they had only a very little [[time]] left
for sleep, for it was soon daybreak. in the meantime telemachus and
his crew were nearing [[land]], so they loosed the sails, took down the
mast, and rowed the ship into the harbour. they cast out their mooring
stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,
mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. as soon as they had had enough
to [[eat]] and drink telemachus said, "take the ship on to the town, but
leave me here, for i want to look after the herdsmen on one of my
farms. in the evening, when i have seen all i want, i will come down
to the [[city]], and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble i will
give you all a [[good]] dinner with meat and wine." 

then theoclymenus said, 'and what, my dear [[young]] friend, is to become
of me? to whose house, among all your [[chief]] [[men]], am i to repair? or
shall i go straight to your own house and to your [[mother]]?"

"at any other [[time]]," replied telemachus, "i should have bidden you
go to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at
the [[present]] moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for
i shall be away, and my [[mother]] will not see you; she does not often
show herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in
an upper chamber, out of their way; but i can tell you a [[man]] whose
house you can go to- i mean eurymachus the [[son]] of polybus, who is
held in the highest estimation by every one in ithaca. he is much
the [[best]] [[man]] and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying
court to my [[mother]] and trying to take ulysses' place. jove, however,
in [[heaven]] alone knows [[know]] whether or no they will come to a [[bad]] end before
the [[marriage]] takes place." 

as he was speaking a bird flew by upon his [[right]] hand- a hawk, apollo's
messenger. it held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore
them off, fell to the ground midway between telemachus and the ship.
on this theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.
"telemachus," said he, "that bird did not fly on your [[right]] hand without
having been sent there by some [[god]]. as soon as i saw it i knew it
was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there
will be no house in ithaca more [[royal]] than your own." 

"i [[wish]] it may prove so," answered telemachus. "if it does, i will
show you so much [[good]] will and give you so many presents [[present]] that all
who meet you will congratulate you." 

then he said to his friend piraeus, "piraeus, [[son]] of clytius, you
have throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all
those who have accompanied me to pylos; i [[wish]] you would take this
stranger to your own house and entertain him hospitably till i can
come for him." 

and piraeus answered, "telemachus, you may stay away as long as you
please, but i will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack
of hospitality." 

as he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose
the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. but telemachus
bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head
of sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. then they loosed the
hawsers, thrust the ship off from [[land]], and made on towards the city
as they had been told to do, while telemachus strode on as fast as
he could, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds
of swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who
was so devoted a servant to his master. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book xvi

meanwhile [[ulysses]] and the swineherd had lit a [[fire]] in the hut and
were were getting breakfast ready at daybreak for they had sent the
men out with the pigs. when telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark,
but fawned upon him, so [[ulysses]], hearing the sound of feet and noticing
that the dogs did not bark, said to eumaeus: 

"eumaeus, i hear footsteps; i suppose one of your [[men]] or some one
of your acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning urn
him and not barking." 

the words were hardly out of his mouth before his [[son]] stood at the
door. eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing
wine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. he kissed
his head and both his beautiful [[eyes]], and wept for joy. a [[father]] could
not be more delighted at the return of an only [[son]], the child of his
old [[age]], after ten years' absence in a [[foreign]] [[country]] and after having
gone through much hardship. he embraced him, kissed him all over as
though he had come back from the [[dead]], and spoke fondly to him saying:

"so you are come, telemachus, [[light]] of my [[eyes]] that you are. when
i heard you had gone to pylos i made sure i was never going to see
you any more. come in, my dear child, and sit down, that i may have
a [[good]] look at you now you are [[home]] again; it is not very often you
come into the [[country]] to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to
the town generally. i suppose you [[think]] it [[better]] to keep an eye on
what the suitors are doing." 

"so be it, old friend," answered telemachus, "but i am come now because
i want to see you, and to learn whether my [[mother]] is still at her
old [[home]] or whether some one else has [[married]] her, so that the bed
of [[ulysses]] is without bedding and covered with cobwebs."

"she is still at the house," replied eumaeus, "grieving and breaking
her [[heart]], and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually."

as spoke he took telemachus' spear, whereon he crossed the stone threshold
and came inside. [[ulysses]] rose from his seat to give him place as he
entered, but telemachus checked him; "sit down, stranger." said he,
"i can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay
it for me." 

ulysses went back to his own place, and eumaeus strewed some green
brushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for telemachus
to sit upon. then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat,
the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he filled
the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. he mixed wine also
in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing [[ulysses]]. then they
laid their hands on the [[good]] things that were before them, and as
soon as they had had enough to [[eat]] and drink telemachus said to eumaeus,
"old friend, where does this stranger come from? how did his crew
bring him to ithaca, and who were they?-for assuredly he did not come
here by land"' 

to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "my [[son]], i will tell you
the real [[truth]]. he says he is a cretan, and that he has been a great
traveller. at this moment he is running away from a thesprotian ship,
and has refuge at my station, so i will put him into your hands. do
whatever you like with him, only [[remember]] that he is your suppliant."

"i am very much distressed," said telemachus, "by what you have just
told me. how can i take this stranger into my house? i am as yet [[young]],
and am not [[strong]] enough to hold my own if any [[man]] attacks me. my
mother cannot make up her [[mind]] whether to stay where she is and look
after the house out of [[respect]] for [[public]] [[opinion]] and the memory of
her husband, or whether the [[time]] is now come for her to take the best
man of those who are wooing her, and the one who will make her the
most advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to your station
i will find him a cloak and shirt of [[good]] wear, with a [[sword]] and sandals,
and will send him wherever he wants to go. or if you like you can
keep him here at the station, and i will send him clothes and food
that he may be no burden on you and on your [[men]]; but i will not have
him go near the suitors, for they are very insolent, and are sure
to ill-treat him in a way that would greatly grieve me; no matter
how valiant a [[man]] may be he can do nothing against numbers, for they
will be too [[strong]] for him." 

then [[ulysses]] said, "sir, it is [[right]] that i should say something myself.
i am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way
in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a [[man]] as you
are. tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some
god set your [[people]] against you? may you not [[complain]] of your brothers-
for it is to these that a [[man]] may look for support, however great
his quarrel may be? i [[wish]] i were as [[young]] as you are and in my present
mind; if i were [[son]] to [[ulysses]], or, indeed, [[ulysses]] himself, i would
rather some one came and cut my head off, but i would go to the house
and be the bane of every one of these [[men]]. if they were too many for
me- i being single-handed- i would rather [[die]] fighting in my own house
than see such disgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly
maltreated, and [[men]] dragging the [[women]] servants about the house in
an unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no
purpose for an end that shall never be accomplished." 

and telemachus answered, "i will tell you truly everything. there
is no emnity between me and my [[people]], nor can i [[complain]] of brothers [[brother]],
to whom a [[man]] may look for support however [[great]] his quarrel may be.
jove has made us a [[race]] of only sons [[son]]. laertes was the only [[son]] of
arceisius, and [[ulysses]] only [[son]] of laertes. i am myself the only son
of [[ulysses]] who left me behind him when he went away, so that i have
never been of any use to him. hence it comes that my house is in the
hands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs [[chief]] from all the neighbouring
islands, dulichium, same, zacynthus, as also all the principal men
of ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying
court to my [[mother]], who will neither say point blank that she will
not [[marry]], nor yet bring matters to an end, so they are making havoc
of my estate, and before long will do so with myself into the bargain.
the issue, however, rests with [[heaven]]. but do you, old friend eumaeus,
go at once and tell penelope that i am safe and have returned from
pylos. tell it to herself alone, and then come back here without letting
any one else [[know]], for there are many who are plotting mischief against
me." 

"i [[understand]] and heed you," replied eumaeus; "you need instruct me
no further, only i am going that way say whether i had not better
let [[poor]] laertes [[know]] that you are returned. he used to superintend
the [[work]] on his farm in spite of his bitter [[sorrow]] about [[ulysses]],
and he would [[eat]] and drink at will along with his servants; but they
tell me that from the day on which you set out for pylos he has neither
eaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his farm,
but sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones."

"more's the [[pity]]," answered telemachus, "i am [[sorry]] for him, but we
must leave him to himself just now. if [[people]] could have everything
their own way, the first thing i should choose would be the return
of my [[father]]; but go, and give your message; then make haste back
again, and do not turn out of your way to tell laertes. tell my mother
to send one of her [[women]] secretly with the news at once, and let him
hear it from her." 

thus did he urge the swineherd; eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,
bound them to his feet, and started for the town. minerva watched
him well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a
woman- [[fair]], stately, and [[wise]]. she stood against the side of the
entry, and revealed herself to [[ulysses]], but telemachus could not see
her, and knew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves
be seen by everybody. [[ulysses]] saw her, and so did the dogs, for they
did not bark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of
the yards. she nodded her head and motioned to [[ulysses]] with her eyebrows;
whereon he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall
of the yards. then she said to him: 

"ulysses, [[noble]] [[son]] of laertes, it is now [[time]] for you to tell your
son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for
the destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. i will
not be long in joining you, for i too am eager for the fray."

as she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. first she threw
a [[fair]] clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him
younger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,
filled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. then she
went away and [[ulysses]] came back inside the hut. his [[son]] was astounded
when he saw him, and turned his [[eyes]] away for [[fear]] he might be looking
upon a [[god]]. 

"stranger," said he, "how suddenly you have changed from what you
were a moment or two ago. you are dressed differently and your colour
is not the same. are you some one or other of the gods that [[live]] in
heaven? if so, be propitious to me till i can make you due sacrifice
and offerings of wrought gold. have [[mercy]] upon me." 

and [[ulysses]] said, "i am no [[god]], why should you take me for one? i
am your [[father]], on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at
the hands of lawless [[men]]." 

as he spoke he kissed his [[son]], and a tear fell from his cheek on to
the ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. but telemachus
could not yet [[believe]] that it was his [[father]], and said: 

"you are not my [[father]], but some [[god]] is flattering me with [[vain]] hopes
that i may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal [[man]] could of himself
contrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young
at a moment's notice, unless a [[god]] were with him. a second ago you
were old and all in rags, and now you are like some [[god]] come down
from [[heaven]]." 

ulysses answered, "telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably
astonished at my being really here. there is no other [[ulysses]] who
will come hereafter. such as i am, it is i, who after long wandering
and much hardship have got [[home]] in the twentieth year to my own [[country]].
what you wonder at is the [[work]] of the redoubtable [[goddess]] minerva,
who does with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases.
at one moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next i am a young
man with [[good]] clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods
who [[live]] in [[heaven]] to make any [[man]] look either [[rich]] or [[poor]]."

as he spoke he sat down, and telemachus threw his arms about his father
and wept. they were both so much moved that they cried aloud like
eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their
half fledged [[young]] by peasants. thus piteously did they weep, and
the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if telemachus had
not suddenly said, "in what ship, my dear [[father]], did your crew bring
you to ithaca? of what nation did they declare themselves to be- for
you cannot have come by [[land]]?" 

"i will tell you the [[truth]], my [[son]]," replied [[ulysses]]. "it was the
phaeacians who brought me here. they are [[great]] sailors, and are in
the habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. they
took me over the sea while i was fast asleep, and landed me in ithaca,
after giving me many presents [[present]] in bronze, gold, and raiment. these
things by heaven's [[mercy]] are lying concealed in a cave, and i am now
come here on the suggestion of minerva that we may consult about killing
our enemies [[enemy]]. first, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with
their number, that i may learn who, and how many, they are. i can
then turn the matter over in my [[mind]], and see whether we two can fight
the whole [[body]] of them ourselves, or whether we must find others to
help us." 

to this telemachus answered, "father, i have always heard of your
renown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of
is a very [[great]] one: i am awed at the mere [[thought]] of it; two men
cannot stand against many and brave ones. there are not ten suitors
only, nor twice ten, but ten many times [[time]] over; you shall learn their
number at once. there are fifty-two chosen youths [[youth]] from dulichium,
and they have six servants; from same there are twenty-four; twenty
young achaeans from zacynthus, and twelve from ithaca itself, all
of them well born. they have with them a servant medon, a bard, and
two [[men]] who can carve at table. if we face such numbers as this, you
may have bitter cause to rue your coming, and your [[revenge]]. see whether
you cannot [[think]] of some one who would be willing to come and help
us." 

"listen to me," replied [[ulysses]], "and [[think]] whether minerva and her
father jove may seem sufficient, or whether i am to try and find some
one else as well." 

"those whom you have named," answered telemachus, "are a couple of
good allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have
power over both gods and [[men]]." 

"these two," continued [[ulysses]], "will not keep long out of the fray,
when the suitors and we join [[fight]] in my house. now, therefore, return
home early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as before.
later on the swineherd will bring me to the [[city]] disguised as a miserable
old beggar. if you see them ill-treating me, steel your [[heart]] against
my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of the house,
or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently trying
to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to you,
for the day of their reckoning is at hand. furthermore i say, and
lay my saying to your [[heart]], when minerva shall put it in my [[mind]],
i will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect
all the armour that is in the house and hide it in the [[strong]] store
room. make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing
it; say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke,
inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when [[ulysses]] went away, but
has become soiled and begrimed with soot. add to this more particularly
that you are afraid jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine,
and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both
banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people
to use them. but leave a [[sword]] and a spear apiece for yourself and
me, and a couple oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any
moment; jove and minerva will then soon quiet these [[people]]. there
is also another matter; if you are indeed my [[son]] and my [[blood]] runs
in your veins, let no one [[know]] that [[ulysses]] is within the house- neither
laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even
penelope herself. let you and me exploit the [[women]] alone, and let
us also make [[trial]] of some other of the [[men]] servants, to see who is
on our side and whose hand is against us." 

"father," replied telemachus, "you will come to [[know]] me by and by,
and when you do you will find that i can keep your counsel. i do not
think, however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either
of us. [[think]] it over. it will take us a long [[time]] to go the round
of the farms and exploit the [[men]], and all the [[time]] the suitors will
be wasting your estate with impunity and without compunction. prove
the [[women]] by all means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless,
but i am not in favour of going round and trying the [[men]]. we can attend
to that later on, if you really have some sign from jove that he will
support you." 

thus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought telemachus
and his crew from pylos had reached the town of ithaca. when they
had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the [[land]]; their
servants came and took their armour from them, and they left all the
presents at the house of clytius. then they sent a servant to tell
penelope that telemachus had gone into the [[country]], but had sent the
ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.
this servant and eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the
same errand of going to tell penelope. when they reached the house,
the servant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the
waiting [[women]], "your [[son]], madam, is now returned from pylos"; but
eumaeus went close up to penelope, and said privately that her son
had given bidden him tell her. when he had given his message he left
the house with its outbuildings and went back to his pigs again.

the suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they
went outside the [[great]] wall that ran round the outer court, and held
a council near the main entrance. eurymachus, [[son]] of polybus, was
the first to speak. 

"my [[friends]]," said he, "this [[voyage]] of telemachus's is a very serious
matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. now, however,
let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send
after the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can."

he had hardly done speaking when amphinomus turned in his place and
saw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails,
and putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others,
"we need not send them any message, for they are here. some [[god]] must
have told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake
her. 

on this they rose and went to the water side. the crew then drew the
ship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they
went up in a [[body]] to the place of assembly, but they would not let
any one old or [[young]] sit along with them, and antinous, [[son]] of eupeithes,
spoke first. 

"good heavens [[heaven]]," said he, "see how the gods have saved this [[man]] from
destruction. we kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all
day long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep,
but waited in the ship all night till morning in the [[hope]] of capturing
and killing him; but some [[god]] has conveyed him [[home]] in spite of us.
let us consider how we can make an end of him. he must not escape
us; our affair is never likely to come off while is alive, for he
is very shrewd, and [[public]] feeling is by no means all on our side.
we must make haste before he can call the achaeans in assembly; he
will lose no [[time]] in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and
will tell all the [[world]] how we plotted to kill him, but failed to
take him. the [[people]] will not like this when they come to [[know]] of
it; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from our own
country into [[exile]]. let us try and lay hold of him either on his farm
away from the town, or on the road hither. then we can divide up his
property amongst us, and let his [[mother]] and the [[man]] who marries her
have the house. if this does not please you, and you [[wish]] telemachus
to [[live]] on and hold his father's [[property]], then we must not gather
here and [[eat]] up his goods [[good]] in this way, but must make our offers to
penelope each from his own house, and she can [[marry]] the [[man]] who will
give the most for her, and whose lot it is to [[win]] her." 

they all held their [[peace]] until amphinomus rose to speak. he was the
son of nisus, who was [[son]] to [[king]] aretias, and he was foremost among
all the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of
dulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to penelope
than that of any of the other for he was a [[man]] of [[good]] [[natural]] disposition.
"my [[friends]]," said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly,
"i am not in favour of killing telemachus. it is a heinous thing to
kill one who is of [[noble]] [[blood]]. let us first take counsel of the gods,
and if the oracles of jove advise it, i will both [[help]] to kill him
myself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade
us, i would have you hold your hands." 

thus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose forthwith
and went to the house of [[ulysses]] where they took their accustomed
seats. 

then penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors.
she knew of the plot against telemachus, for the servant medon had
overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore
to the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors
she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister
holding a veil before her face, and rebuked antinous saying:

"antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best
speaker and counsellor of any [[man]] your own [[age]] in ithaca, but you
are nothing of the [[kind]]. madman, why should you try to compass the
death of telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness
is jove himself? it is not [[right]] for you to plot thus against one
another. do you not [[remember]] how your [[father]] fled to this house in
fear of the [[people]], who were enraged against him for having gone with
some taphian pirates and plundered the thesprotians who were at peace
with us? they wanted to tear him in pieces and [[eat]] up everything he
had, but [[ulysses]] stayed their hands although they were infuriated,
and now you devour his [[property]] without paying for it, and break my
heart by his wooing his [[wife]] and trying to kill his [[son]]. leave off
doing so, and stop the others also." 

to this eurymachus [[son]] of polybus answered, "take [[heart]], queen penelope
daughter of icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters.
the [[man]] is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon
your [[son]] telemachus, while i yet [[live]] to look upon the face of the
earth. i say- and it shall surely be- that my spear shall be reddened
with his [[blood]]; for many a [[time]] has [[ulysses]] taken me on his knees,
held wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands.
therefore telemachus is much the dearest friend i have, and has nothing
to [[fear]] from the hands of us suitors. of course, if [[death]] comes to
him from the gods, he cannot escape it." he said this to quiet her,
but in reality he was plotting against telemachus. 

then penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till minerva
shed sleep over her [[eyes]]. in the evening eumaeus got back to ulysses
and his [[son]], who had just sacrificed a [[young]] pig of a year old and
were ready; helping one another to get supper ready; minerva therefore
came up to [[ulysses]], turned him into an old [[man]] with a stroke of her
wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for [[fear]] that the swineherd
might recognize him and not keep the secret, but go and tell penelope.

telemachus was the first to speak. "so you have got back, eumaeus,"
said he. "what is the news of the town? have the suitors returned,
or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way [[home]]?"

"i did not [[think]] of asking about that," replied eumaeus, "when i was
in the town. i [[thought]] i would give my message and come back as soon
as i could. i met a [[man]] sent by those who had gone with you to pylos,
and he was the first to tell the new your [[mother]], but i can say what
i saw with my own [[eyes]]; i had just got on to the crest of the hill
of mercury above the town when i saw a ship coming into harbour with
a number of [[men]] in her. they had many shields and spears, and i thought
it was the suitors, but i cannot be sure." 

on hearing this telemachus smiled to his [[father]], but so that eumaeus
could not see him. 

then, when they had finished their [[work]] and the meal was ready, they
ate it, and every [[man]] had his full share so that all were satisfied.
as soon as they had had enough to [[eat]] and drink, they laid down to
rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.

book xvii

when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, telemachus
bound on his sandals and took a [[strong]] spear that suited his hands,
for he wanted to go into the [[city]]. "old friend," said he to the swineherd,
"i will now go to the town and show myself to my [[mother]], for she will
never leave off grieving till she has seen me. as for this unfortunate
stranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who
will give him a drink and a piece of bread. i have trouble enough
of my own, and cannot be burdened with other [[people]]. if this makes
him angry so much the worse for him, but i like to say what i mean."

then [[ulysses]] said, "sir, i do not want to stay here; a beggar can
always do [[better]] in town than [[country]], for any one who likes can give
him something. i am too old to [[care]] about remaining here at the beck
and call of a master. therefore let this [[man]] do as you have just told
him, and take me to the town as soon as i have had a warm by the [[fire]],
and the day has got a little heat in it. my clothes are wretchedly
thin, and this frosty morning i shall be perished with cold, for you
say the [[city]] is some way off." 

on this telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge
upon the when he reached [[home]] he stood his spear against a bearing-post
of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and
went inside. 

nurse euryclea saw him long before any one else did. she was putting
the fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up
to him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and
shoulders with their kisses. penelope came out of her room looking
like diana or [[venus]], and wept as she flung her arms about her [[son]].
she kissed his forehead and both his beautiful [[eyes]], "light of my
eyes," she cried as she spoke fondly to him, "so you are come home
again; i made sure i was never going to see you any more. to think
of your having gone off to pylos without saying anything about it
or obtaining my [[consent]]. but come, tell me what you saw."

"do not scold me, [[mother]],' answered telemachus, "nor vex me, seeing
what a narrow escape i have had, but wash your face, [[change]] your dress,
go upstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs
to all the gods if jove will only grant us our [[revenge]] upon the suitors.
i must now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has
come back with me from pylos. i sent him on with my crew, and told
piraeus to take him [[home]] and look after him till i could come for
him myself." 

she heeded her son's words, washed her face, changed her dress, and
vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would
only vouchsafe her [[revenge]] upon the suitors. 

telemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand-
not alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. minerva endowed him
with a presence of such [[divine]] comeliness that all marvelled at him
as he went by, and the suitors gathered round him with [[fair]] words
in their mouths and malice in their hearts [[heart]]; but he avoided them, and
went to sit with mentor, antiphus, and halitherses, old [[friends]] of
his father's house, and they made him tell them all that had happened
to him. then piraeus came up with theoclymenus, whom he had escorted
through the town to the place of assembly, whereon telemachus at once
joined them. piraeus was first to speak: "telemachus," said he, "i
wish you would send some of your [[women]] to my house to take awa the
presents menelaus gave you." 

"we do not [[know]], piraeus," answered telemachus, "what may happen.
if the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my [[property]] among
them, i would rather you had the presents [[present]] than that any of those people
should get hold of them. if on the other hand i manage to kill them,
i shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents [[present]]."

with these words he took theoclymenus to his own house. when they
got there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into
the baths, and washed themselves. when the maids had washed and anointed
them, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats
at table. a maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden
ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands;
and she drew a clean table beside them. an upper servant brought them
bread and offered them many [[good]] things of what there was in the house.
opposite them sat penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the bearing-posts
of the cloister, and spinning. then they laid their hands on the good
things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to
eat and drink penelope said: 

"telemachus, i shall go upstairs and [[lie]] down on that [[sad]] couch, which
i have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day [[ulysses]] set
out for troy with the sons [[son]] of atreus. you failed, however, to make
it clear to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether
or no you had been able to hear anything about the return of your
father." 

"i will tell you then [[truth]]," replied her [[son]]. "we went to pylos and
saw nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably
as though i were a [[son]] of his own who had just returned after a long
absence; so also did his sons [[son]]; but he said he had not heard a word
from any [[human]] being about [[ulysses]], whether he was alive or [[dead]].
he sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to menelaus. there
i saw helen, for whose sake so many, both argives and trojans, were
in heaven's [[wisdom]] doomed to suffer. menelaus [[asked]] me what it was
that had brought me to lacedaemon, and i told him the whole [[truth]],
whereon he said, 'so, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man's
bed? a hind might as well lay her new-born [[young]] in the lair of a
lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell.
the lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short [[work]] with
the pair of them, and so will [[ulysses]] with these suitors. by father
jove, minerva, and [[apollo]], if [[ulysses]] is still the [[man]] that he was
when he wrestled with philomeleides in lesbos, and threw him so heavily
that all the greeks [[greek]] cheered him- if he is still such, and were to
come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry
wedding. as regards your [[question]], however, i will not prevaricate
nor [[deceive]] you, but what the old [[man]] of the sea told me, so much
will i tell you in full. he said he could see [[ulysses]] on an island
sorrowing bitterly in the house of the [[nymph]] calypso, who was keeping
him [[prisoner]], and he could not reach his [[home]], for he had no ships
nor sailors to take him over the sea.' this was what menelaus told
me, and when i had heard his story i came away; the gods then gave
me a [[fair]] wind and soon brought me safe [[home]] again." 

with these words he moved the [[heart]] of penelope. then theoclymenus
said to her: 

"madam, [[wife]] of [[ulysses]], telemachus does not [[understand]] these things;
listen therefore to me, for i can [[divine]] them surely, and will hide
nothing from you. may jove the [[king]] of [[heaven]] be my witness, and the
rites of hospitality, with that hearth of [[ulysses]] to which i now come,
that [[ulysses]] himself is even now in ithaca, and, either going about
the [[country]] or staying in one place, is enquiring into all these evil
deeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. i saw an omen
when i was on the ship which meant this, and i told telemachus about
it." 

"may it be even so," answered penelope; "if your words come true,
you shall have such gifts and such [[good]] will from me that all who
see you shall congratulate you." 

thus did they converse. meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs,
or aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of
the house, and behaving with all their old insolence. but when it
was now [[time]] for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come
into the town from all the [[country]] round, with their shepherds as
usual, then medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited
upon them at table, said, "now then, my [[young]] masters, you have had
enough [[sport]], so come inside that we may get dinner ready. dinner
is not a [[bad]] thing, at dinner [[time]]." 

they left their sports [[sport]] as he told them, and when they were within
the house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside,
and then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of
them fat and well grown. thus they made ready for their meal. in the
meantime [[ulysses]] and the swineherd were about starting for the town,
and the swineherd said, "stranger, i suppose you still want to go
to town to-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part
i should have liked you to stay here as a station hand, but i must
do as my master tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding
from one's master is a very serious thing. let us then be off, for
it is now broad day; it will be night again directly and then you
will find it colder." 

"i [[know]], and [[understand]] you," replied [[ulysses]]; "you need say no more.
let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it
to walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one."

as he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders,
by the cord from which it hung, and eumaeus gave him a stick to his
liking. the two then started, leaving the station in charge of the
dogs and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd [[led]] the way and
his master followed after, looking like some broken-down old tramp
as he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. when
they had got over the rough steep ground and were nearing the [[city]],
they reached the fountain from which the [[citizens]] drew their water.
this had been made by ithacus, neritus, and polyctor. there was a
grove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and
the clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, while above
the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs [[nymph]], at which all wayfarers
used to [[sacrifice]]. here melanthius [[son]] of dolius overtook them as
he was driving down some goats, the [[best]] in his flock, for the suitors'
dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. when he saw eumaeus
and [[ulysses]] he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly [[language]],
which made [[ulysses]] very angry. 

"there you go," cried he, "and a precious pair you are. see how heaven
brings birds of the same feather to one another. where, [[pray]], master
swineherd, are you taking this [[poor]] miserable object? it would make
any one sick to see such a creature at table. a fellow like this never
won a prize for anything in his [[life]], but will go about rubbing his
shoulders against every man's [[man]] door post, and begging, not for swords
and cauldrons like a [[man]], but only for a few scraps not worth begging
for. if you would give him to me for a hand on my station, he might
do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids,
and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but
he has taken to [[bad]] ways and will not go about any [[kind]] of [[work]]; he
will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over, to feed his insatiable
belly. i say, therefore and it shall surely be- if he goes near ulysses'
house he will get his head broken by the stools they will fling at
him, till they turn him out." 

on this, as he passed, he gave [[ulysses]] a kick on the hip out of pure
wantonness, but [[ulysses]] stood firm, and did not budge from the path.
for a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at melanthius and kill
him with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains
out; he resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check,
but the swineherd looked straight at melanthius and rebuked him, lifting
up his hands and praying to [[heaven]] as he did so. 

"fountain nymphs [[nymph]]," he cried, "children of jove, if ever [[ulysses]] burned
you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my
prayer that [[heaven]] may send him [[home]]. he would soon put an end to
the swaggering threats with which such [[men]] as you go about insulting
people-gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin
through [[bad]] shepherding." 

then melanthius the goatherd answered, "you ill-conditioned cur, what
are you talking about? some day or other i will put you on board ship
and take you to a [[foreign]] [[country]], where i can sell you and pocket
the [[money]] you will fetch. i [[wish]] i were as sure that [[apollo]] would
strike telemachus [[dead]] this very day, or that the suitors would kill
him, as i am that [[ulysses]] will never come [[home]] again." 

with this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went
quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. when he
got there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite
eurymachus, who liked him [[better]] than any of the others. the servants
brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread
before him that he might [[eat]]. presently [[ulysses]] and the swineherd
came up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of [[music]], for phemius
was just beginning to sing to the suitors. then [[ulysses]] took hold
of the swineherd's hand, and said: 

"eumaeus, this house of [[ulysses]] is a very fine place. no matter how
far you go you will find few like it. one building keeps following
on after another. the outer court has a wall with battlements all
round it; the doors are double folding, and of [[good]] workmanship; it
would be a hard matter to take it by [[force]] of arms. i perceive, too,
that there are many [[people]] banqueting within it, for there is a smell
of roast meat, and i hear a sound of [[music]], which the gods have made
to go along with feasting." 

then eumaeus said, "you have perceived aright, as indeed you generally
do; but let us [[think]] what will be our [[best]] course. will you go inside
first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you
wait here and let me go in first? but do not wait long, or some one
may you loitering about outside, and throw something at you. consider
this matter i [[pray]] you." 

and [[ulysses]] answered, "i [[understand]] and heed. go in first and leave
me here where i am. i am quite used to being beaten and having things
thrown at me. i have been so much buffeted about in [[war]] and by sea
that i am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. but a
man cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy
which gives much trouble to all [[men]]; it is because of this that ships
are fitted out to sail the seas, and to make [[war]] upon other [[people]]."

as they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised
his head and pricked up his ears. this was argos, whom [[ulysses]] had
bred before setting out for troy, but he had never had any [[work]] out
of him. in the old days he used to be taken out by the [[young]] [[men]] when
they went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his
master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow
dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the [[men]] should come
and draw it away to manure the [[great]] close; and he was full of fleas.
as soon as he saw [[ulysses]] standing there, he dropped his ears and
wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. when
ulysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear from
his [[eyes]] without eumaeus seeing it, and said: 

"eumaeus, what a [[noble]] hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:
his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he
only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept
merely for show?" 

"this hound," answered eumaeus, "belonged to him who has died in a
far [[country]]. if he were what he was when [[ulysses]] left for troy, he
would soon show you what he could do. there was not a wild beast in
the forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks.
but now he has fallen on [[evil]] times [[time]], for his master is [[dead]] and gone,
and the [[women]] take no [[care]] of him. servants never do their [[work]] when
their master's hand is no longer over them, for jove takes half the
goodness out of a [[man]] when he makes a [[slave]] of him." 

as he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the
suitors were, but argos died as soon as he had recognized his master.

telemachus saw eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned
him to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat
lying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the
suitors; he picked it up, brought it to telemachus's table, and sat
down opposite him. then the servant brought him his portion, and gave
him bread from the bread-basket. 

immediately afterwards [[ulysses]] came inside, looking like a [[poor]] miserable
old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags.
he sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading
from the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood
which the carpenter had skillfully planed, and had made to join truly
with [[rule]] and line. telemachus took a whole loaf from the bread-basket,
with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and said to eumaeus,
"take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round of the suitors,
and beg from them; a beggar must not be shamefaced." 

so eumaeus went up to him and said, "stranger, telemachus sends you
this, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for
beggars must not be shamefaced." 

ulysses answered, "may [[king]] jove grant all [[happiness]] to telemachus,
and fulfil the [[desire]] of his [[heart]]." 

then with both hands he took what telemachus had sent him, and laid
it on the dirty old wallet at his feet. he went on eating it while
the bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left
off. the suitors applauded the bard, whereon minerva went up to ulysses
and prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors,
that he might see what [[kind]] of [[people]] they were, and tell the good
from the [[bad]]; but come what might she was not going to save a single
one of them. [[ulysses]], therefore, went on his round, going from left
to [[right]], and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real
beggar. some of them pitied him, and were [[curious]] about him, asking
one another who he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd
melanthius said, "suitors of my [[noble]] mistress, i can tell you something
about him, for i have seen him before. the swineherd brought him here,
but i [[know]] nothing about the [[man]] himself, nor where he comes from."

on this antinous began to [[abuse]] the swineherd. "you precious idiot,"
he cried, "what have you brought this [[man]] to town for? have we not
tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?
do you [[think]] it a small thing that such [[people]] gather here to waste
your master's [[property]] and must you needs bring this [[man]] as well?"

and eumaeus answered, "antinous, your birth is [[good]] but your words
evil. it was no doing of mine that he came here. who is likely to
invite a stranger from a [[foreign]] [[country]], unless it be one of those
who can do [[public]] service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter,
or a bard who can charm us with his such [[men]] are welcome all the world
over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him.
you are always harder on ulysses' servants than any of the other suitors
are, and above all on me, but i do not [[care]] so long as telemachus
and penelope are alive and here." 

but telemachus said, "hush, do not [[answer]] him; antinous has the bitterest
tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse."

then turning to antinous he said, "antinous, you take as much care
of my interests as though i were your [[son]]. why should you want to
see this stranger turned out of the house? [[heaven]] forbid; take' something
and give it him yourself; i do not grudge it; i bid you take it. never
mind my [[mother]], nor any of the other servants in the house; but i
know you will not do what i say, for you are more fond of eating things
yourself than of giving them to other [[people]]." 

"what do you mean, telemachus," replied antinous, "by this swaggering
talk? if all the suitors were to give him as much as i will, he would
not come here again for another three months." 

as he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from
under the table, and made as though he would throw it at [[ulysses]],
but the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet
with bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold
and [[eat]] what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to antinous
and said: 

"sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest [[man]] here;
you seem to be a [[chief]], foremost among them all; therefore you should
be the [[better]] giver, and i will tell far and wide of your bounty.
i too was a [[rich]] [[man]] once, and had a fine house of my own; in those
days i gave to many a tramp such as i now am, no matter who he might
be nor what he wanted. i had any number of servants, and all the other
things which [[people]] have who [[live]] well and are accounted wealthy,
but it pleased jove to take all away from me. he sent me with a band
of roving robbers to [[egypt]]; it was a long [[voyage]] and i was undone
by it. i stationed my bade ships in the river aegyptus, and bade my
men stay by them and keep guard over them, while sent out scouts to
reconnoitre from every point of vantage. 

"but the [[men]] disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged
the [[land]] of the [[egyptians]], killing the [[men]], and taking their wives
and [[children]] captives. the alarm was soon carried to the [[city]], and
when they heard the war-cry, the [[people]] came out at daybreak till
the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam
of armour. then jove spread panic among my [[men]], and they would no
longer face the [[enemy]], for they found themselves surrounded. the egyptians
killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced [[labour]] for
them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them, to take
to cyprus, dmetor by name, [[son]] of iasus, who was a [[great]] [[man]] in cyprus.
thence i am come hither in a [[state]] of [[great]] misery." 

then antinous said, "what [[god]] can have sent such a pestilence to plague
us during our dinner? get out, into the open part of the court, or
i will give you [[egypt]] and cyprus over again for your insolence and
importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given
you lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to
be [[free]] with other people's [[property]] when there is plenty of it."

on this [[ulysses]] began to move off, and said, "your looks, my fine
sir, are [[better]] than your breeding; if you were in your own house
you would not spare a [[poor]] [[man]] so much as a pinch of salt, for though
you are in another man's [[man]], and surrounded with abundance, you cannot
find it in you to give him even a piece of bread." 

this made antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, "you
shall [[pay]] for this before you get clear of the court." with these
words he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the [[right]] shoulder-blade
near the top of his back. [[ulysses]] stood firm as a rock and the blow
did not even stagger him, but he shook his head in [[silence]] as he brooded
on his [[revenge]]. then he went back to the threshold and sat down there,
laying his well-filled wallet at his feet. 

"listen to me," he cried, "you suitors of queen penelope, that i may
speak even as i am minded. a [[man]] knows [[know]] neither ache nor [[pain]] if he
gets hit while fighting for his [[money]], or for his sheep or his cattle;
and even so antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable
belly, which is always getting [[people]] into trouble. still, if the
poor have gods and avenging deities at all, i [[pray]] them that antinous
may come to a [[bad]] end before his [[marriage]]." 

"sit where you are, and [[eat]] your victuals in [[silence]], or be off elsewhere,"
shouted antinous. "if you say more i will have you dragged hand and
foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you alive."

the other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young
men said, "antinous, you did ill in striking that [[poor]] wretch of a
tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god-
and we [[know]] the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people
from [[foreign]] countries [[country]], and travel about the [[world]] to see who do amiss
and who righteously." 

thus said the suitors, but antinous paid them no heed. meanwhile telemachus
was furious about the blow that had been given to his [[father]], and
though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in [[silence]] and brooded
on his [[revenge]]. 

now when penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the banqueting-cloister,
she said before her maids, "would that [[apollo]] would so strike you,
antinous," and her waiting woman eurynome answered, "if our prayers
were answered not one of the suitors would ever again see the sun
rise." then penelope said, "nurse, i hate every [[single]] one of them,
for they mean nothing but mischief, but i hate antinous like the darkness
of [[death]] itself. a [[poor]] unfortunate tramp has come begging about the
house for sheer want. every one else has given him something to put
in his wallet, but antinous has hit him on the [[right]] shoulder-blade
with a footstool." 

thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in
the meantime [[ulysses]] was getting his dinner. then she called for the
swineherd and said, "eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here,
i want to see him and ask him some questions [[question]]. he seems to have travelled
much, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband."

to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "if these achaeans, madam,
would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the [[history]] of his
adventures. i had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,
which was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,
and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. if he had
been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole [[world]], on whose
lips all hearers hang entranced, i could not have been more charmed
as i sat in my hut and listened to him. he says there is an old friendship
between his house and that of [[ulysses]], and that he comes from crete
where the descendants of minos [[live]], after having been driven hither
and thither by every [[kind]] of misfortune; he also declares that he
has heard of [[ulysses]] as being alive and near at hand among the thesprotians,
and that he is bringing [[great]] [[wealth]] [[home]] with him." 

"call him here, then," said penelope, "that i too may hear his story.
as for the suitors, let them take their [[pleasure]] indoors or out as
they will, for they have nothing to fret about. their corn and wine
remain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume
them, while they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing
our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving
so much as a [[thought]] to the quantity of wine they drink. no estate
can stand such recklessness, for we have now no [[ulysses]] to protect
us. if he were to come again, he and his [[son]] would soon have their
revenge." 

as she spoke telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded
with it. penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to eumaeus,
"go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my [[son]] sneezed just
as i was speaking? this can only mean that all the suitors are going
to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape. furthermore i
say, and lay my saying to your [[heart]]: if i am satisfied that the stranger
is speaking the [[truth]] i shall give him a shirt and cloak of [[good]] wear."

when eumaeus heard this he went straight to [[ulysses]] and said, "father
stranger, my mistress penelope, [[mother]] of telemachus, has sent for
you; she is in [[great]] [[grief]], but she wishes [[wish]] to hear anything you can
tell her about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking
the [[truth]], she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very
things that you are most in want of. as for bread, you can get enough
of that to fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting
those give that will." 

"i will tell penelope," answered [[ulysses]], "nothing but what is strictly
true. i [[know]] all about her husband, and have been partner with him
in affliction, but i am afraid of passing. through this crowd of cruel
suitors, for their [[pride]] and insolence reach [[heaven]]. just now, moreover,
as i was going about the house without doing any harm, a [[man]] gave
me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither telemachus nor any one
else defended me. tell penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait
till sundown. let her give me a seat close up to the [[fire]], for my
clothes are worn very thin- you [[know]] they are, for you have seen them
ever since i first [[asked]] you to [[help]] me- she can then ask me about
the return of her husband." 

the swineherd went back when he heard this, and penelope said as she
saw him cross the threshold, "why do you not bring him here, eumaeus?
is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming
inside the house at all? beggars should not be shamefaced."

to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "the stranger is quite
reasonable. he is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any
one else would do. he asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be
much [[better]], madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when
you can hear him and talk to him as you will." 

"the [[man]] is no [[fool]]," answered penelope, "it would very likely be
as he says, for there are no such abominable [[people]] in the whole world
as these [[men]] are." 

when she had done speaking eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he
had explained everything. then he went up to telemachus and said in
his ear so that none could overhear him, "my dear sir, i will now
go back to the pigs, to see after your [[property]] and my own [[business]].
you will look to what is going on here, but above all be careful to
keep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. may
jove bring them to a [[bad]] end before they do us a mischief."

"very well," replied telemachus, "go [[home]] when you have had your dinner,
and in the morning come here with the victims we are to sacrifice
for the day. leave the rest to [[heaven]] and me." 

on this eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his
dinner he left the courts and the cloister with the [[men]] at table,
and went back to his pigs. as for the suitors, they presently began
to amuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting
on towards evening.

book xviii

now there came a [[certain]] [[common]] tramp who used to go begging all
over the [[city]] of ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton
and drunkard. this [[man]] had no [[strength]] nor stay in him, but he was
a [[great]] hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his mother
gave him, was arnaeus, but the [[young]] [[men]] of the place called him irus,
because he used to run errands for any one who would send him. as
soon as he came he began to insult [[ulysses]], and to try and drive him
out of his own house. 

"be off, old [[man]]," he cried, "from the doorway, or you shall be dragged
out neck and heels. do you not see that they are all giving me the
wink, and wanting me to turn you out by [[force]], only i do not like
to do so? get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to blows."

ulysses frowned on him and said, "my friend, i do you no manner of
harm; [[people]] give you a [[great]] deal, but i am not [[jealous]]. there is
room enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge
me things that are not yours to give. you seem to be just such another
tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us [[better]] [[luck]] by
and by. do not, however, talk too much about fighting or you will
incense me, and old though i am, i shall cover your mouth and chest
with [[blood]]. i shall have more [[peace]] to-morrow if i do, for you will
not come to the house of [[ulysses]] any more." 

irus was very angry and answered, "you filthy glutton, you run on
trippingly like an old fish-fag. i have a [[good]] [[mind]] to lay both hands
about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar's
tusks. get ready, therefore, and let these [[people]] here stand by and
look on. you will never be able to [[fight]] one who is so much younger
than yourself." 

thus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front
of the doorway, and when antinous saw what was going on he laughed
heartily and said to the others, "this is the finest [[sport]] that you
ever saw; [[heaven]] never yet sent anything like it into this house.
the stranger and irus have quarreled and are going to [[fight]], let us
set them on to do so at once." 

the suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged
tramps. "listen to me," said antinous, "there are some goats' paunches
down at the [[fire]], which we have filled with [[blood]] and fat, and set
aside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the
better [[man]] shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be [[free]] of our
table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all."

the others all agreed, but [[ulysses]], to throw them off the scent, said,
"sirs, an old [[man]] like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold
his own against a [[young]] one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on,
though i [[know]] it can only end in my getting a drubbing. you must swear,
however that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour irus and
secure him the [[victory]]." 

they swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath
telemachus put in a word and said, "stranger, if you have a [[mind]] to
settle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. whoever
strikes you will have to [[fight]] more than one. i am host, and the other
chiefs, antinous and eurymachus, both of them [[men]] of understanding,
are of the same [[mind]] as i am." 

every one assented, and [[ulysses]] girded his old rags about his loins,
thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and
his mighty arms; but minerva came up to him and made his limbs even
stronger still. the suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one
would turn towards his neighbour saying, "the stranger has brought
such a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left
of irus." 

irus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded
him by [[force]], and brought him [into the open part of the court] in
such a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. antinous scolded
him and said, "you swaggering bully, you ought never to have been
born at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creature
as this tramp is. i say, therefore- and it shall surely be- if he
beats you and proves himself the [[better]] [[man]], i shall pack you off
on board ship to the mainland and send you to [[king]] echetus, who kills
every one that comes near him. he will cut off your nose and ears,
and draw out your entrails for the dogs to [[eat]]." 

this frightened irus still more, but they brought him into the middle
of the court, and the two [[men]] raised their hands to [[fight]]. then ulysses
considered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an
end of him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter
blow that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best
to give the lighter blow for [[fear]] the achaeans should begin to suspect
who he was. then they began to [[fight]], and irus hit [[ulysses]] on the
right shoulder; but [[ulysses]] gave irus a blow on the neck under the
ear that broke in the bones of his skull, and the [[blood]] came gushing
out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth
and kicking on the ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and
nearly died of laughter, as [[ulysses]] caught hold of him by the foot
and dragged him into the outer court as far as the gate-house. there
he propped him up against the wall and put his staff in his hands.
"sit here," said he, "and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful
creature, and if you try to make yourself [[king]] of the beggars any
more you shall fare still worse." 

then he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, over his
shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down
upon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing
and saluting him, "may jove, and all the other gods," said they, 'grant
you whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity of
this insatiable tramp. we will take him over to the mainland presently,
to [[king]] echetus, who kills every one that comes near him."

ulysses hailed this as of [[good]] omen, and antinous set a [[great]] goat's
paunch before him filled with [[blood]] and fat. amphinomus took two loaves
out of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he
did so in a golden goblet of wine. "good [[luck]] to you," he said, "father
stranger, you are very badly off at [[present]], but i [[hope]] you will have
better times [[time]] by and by." 

to this [[ulysses]] answered, "amphinomus, you seem to be a [[man]] of good
understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose [[son]] you are.
i have heard your [[father]] well spoken of; he is nisus of dulichium,
a [[man]] both brave and wealthy. they tell me you are his [[son]], and you
appear to be a considerable [[person]]; listen, therefore, and take heed
to what i am saying. [[man]] is the vainest of all creatures that have
their being upon [[earth]]. as long as [[heaven]] vouchsafes him health and
strength, he thinks [[think]] that he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even
when the blessed gods bring [[sorrow]] upon him, he bears it as he needs
must, and makes the [[best]] of it; for [[god]] almighty gives [[men]] their daily
minds day by day. i [[know]] all about it, for i was a [[rich]] [[man]] once,
and did much [[wrong]] in the stubbornness of my [[pride]], and in the confidence
that my [[father]] and my brothers [[brother]] would support me; therefore let a man
fear [[god]] in all things always, and take the [[good]] that [[heaven]] may see
fit to send him without vainglory. consider the infamy of what these
suitors are doing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing
dishonour to the [[wife]], of one who is [[certain]] to return some day, and
that, too, not long hence. nay, he will be here soon; may [[heaven]] send
you [[home]] quietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of
his coming, for once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly."

with these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk he
put the gold cup again into the hands of amphinomus, who walked away
serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded [[evil]]. but even so he
did not escape destruction, for minerva had doomed him fall by the
hand of telemachus. so he took his seat again at the place from which
he had come. 

then minerva put it into the [[mind]] of penelope to show herself to the
suitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and
win still further [[honour]] from her [[son]] and husband. so she feigned
a mocking laugh and said, "eurynome, i have changed my and have a
fancy to show myself to the suitors although i detest them. i should
like also to give my [[son]] a hint that he had [[better]] not have anything
more to do with them. they speak fairly enough but they mean mischief."

"my dear child," answered eurynome, "all that you have said is true,
go and tell your [[son]] about it, but first wash yourself and anoint
your face. do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears;
it is not [[right]] that you should grieve so incessantly; for telemachus,
whom you always prayed that you might [[live]] to see with a beard, is
already grown up." 

"i [[know]], eurynome," replied penelope, "that you mean well, but do
not try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for [[heaven]] robbed
me of all my [[beauty]] on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell
autonoe and hippodamia that i want them. they must be with me when
i am in the cloister; i am not going among the [[men]] alone; it would
not be proper for me to do so." 

on this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go to
their mistress. in the meantime minerva bethought her of another matter,
and sent penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on her
couch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. then the [[goddess]] shed
grace and [[beauty]] over her that all the achaeans might [[admire]] her.
she washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that [[venus]] wears
when she goes dancing with the graces; she made her taller and of
a more commanding figure, while as for her [[complexion]] it was whiter
than sawn ivory. when minerva had done all this she went away, whereon
the maids came in from the women's room and woke penelope with the
sound of their talking. 

"what an exquisitely delicious sleep i have been having," said she,
as she passed her hands over her face, "in spite of all my misery.
i [[wish]] diana would let me [[die]] so sweetly now at this very moment,
that i might no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband,
who possessed every [[kind]] of [[good]] quality and was the most distinguished
man among the achaeans." 

with these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but
attended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she
stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,
holding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either
side of her. as they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and
became so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might
win her for his own bed fellow. 

"telemachus," said she, addressing her [[son]], "i [[fear]] you are no longer
so discreet and well conducted as you used to be. when you were younger
you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are grown
up, though a stranger to look at you would take you for the [[son]] of
a well-to-do [[father]] as far as size and [[good]] looks go, your conduct
is by no means what it should be. what is all this disturbance that
has been going on, and how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully
ill-treated? what would have happened if he had [[suffered]] serious injury
while a suppliant in our house? surely this would have been very discreditable
to you." 

"i am not surprised, my dear [[mother]], at your displeasure," replied
telemachus, "i [[understand]] all about it and [[know]] when things are not
as they should be, which i could not do when i was younger; i cannot,
however, behave with [[perfect]] propriety at all times [[time]]. first one and
then another of these wicked [[people]] here keeps driving me out of my
mind, and i have no one to stand by me. after all, however, this fight
between irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant
it to do, for the stranger got the [[best]] of it. i [[wish]] [[father]] jove,
minerva, and [[apollo]] would break the neck of every one of these wooers
of yours, some inside the house and some out; and i [[wish]] they might
all be as limp as irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court.
see how he nods his head like a drunken [[man]]; he has had such a thrashing
that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his [[home]], wherever
that may be, for has no [[strength]] left in him." 

thus did they converse. eurymachus then came up and said, "queen penelope,
daughter of icarius, if all the achaeans in iasian argos could see
you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house
by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole
world both as regards personal [[beauty]] and [[strength]] of understanding."

to this penelope replied, "eurymachus, [[heaven]] robbed me of all my
beauty whether of face or figure when the argives set sail for troy
and my dear husband with them. if he were to return and look after
my affairs, i should both be more respected and show a [[better]] presence
to the [[world]]. as it is, i am [[oppressed]] with [[care]], and with the afflictions
which [[heaven]] has seen fit to heap upon me. my husband foresaw it all,
and when he was leaving [[home]] he took my [[right]] wrist in his hand- 'wife,
'he said, 'we shall not all of us come safe [[home]] from troy, for the
trojans [[fight]] well both with bow and spear. they are excellent also
at fighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight
sooner than this. i [[know]] not, therefore, whether [[heaven]] will send
me back to you, or whether i may not fall over there at troy. in the
meantime do you look after things here. take [[care]] of my [[father]] and
mother as at [[present]], and even more so during my absence, but when
you see our [[son]] growing a beard, then [[marry]] whom you will, and leave
this your [[present]] [[home]]. this is what he said and now it is all coming
true. a night will come when i shall have to yield myself to a marriage
which i detest, for jove has taken from me all [[hope]] of [[happiness]].
this further [[grief]], moreover, cuts me to the very [[heart]]. you suitors
are not wooing me after the custom of my [[country]]. when [[men]] are courting
a woman who they [[think]] will be a [[good]] [[wife]] to them and who is of noble
birth, and when they are each trying to [[win]] her for himself, they
usually bring oxen and sheep to feast the [[friends]] of the [[lady]], and
they make her magnificent presents [[present]], instead of eating up other people's
property without paying for it." 

this was what she said, and [[ulysses]] was glad when he heard her trying
to get presents [[present]] out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair
words which he knew she did not mean. 

then antinous said, "queen penelope, [[daughter]] of icarius, take as
many presents [[present]] as you please from any one who will give them to you;
it is not well to refuse a [[present]]; but we will not go about our business
nor stir from where we are, till you have [[married]] the [[best]] [[man]] among
us whoever he may be." 

the others applauded what antinous had said, and each one sent his
servant to bring his [[present]]. antinous's [[man]] returned with a large
and lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. it had twelve beautifully
made brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. eurymachus
immediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads
that gleamed like sunlight. eurydamas's two [[men]] returned with some
earrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened most
beautifully; while [[king]] pisander [[son]] of polyctor gave her a necklace
of the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful
present of some [[kind]]. 

then the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought
the presents [[present]] after her. meanwhile the suitors took to singing and
dancing, and stayed till evening came. they danced and sang till it
grew dark; they then brought in three braziers to give [[light]], and
piled them up with chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torches
from them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. then ulysses
said: 

"maids, servants of [[ulysses]] who has so long been absent, go to the
queen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick
wool. i will hold the [[light]] for all these [[people]]. they may stay till
morning, but shall not beat me, for i can stand a [[great]] deal."

the maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty melantho
began to gibe at him contemptuously. she was [[daughter]] to dolius, but
had been brought up by penelope, who used to give her toys to play
with, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all
this she showed no consideration for the sorrows [[sorrow]] of her mistress,
and used to misconduct herself with eurymachus, with whom she was
in [[love]]. 

"poor wretch," said she, "are you gone clean out of your [[mind]]? go
and sleep in some smithy, or place of [[public]] gossips, instead of chattering
here. are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters-
so many of them too? has the wine been getting into your head, or
do you always babble in this way? you seem to have lost your wits
because you beat the tramp irus; take [[care]] that a [[better]] [[man]] than
he does not come and cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding
out of the house." 

"vixen," replied [[ulysses]], scowling at her, "i will go and tell telemachus
what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb from limb."

with these words he scared the [[women]], and they went off into the body
of the house. they trembled all aver, for they [[thought]] he would do
as he said. but [[ulysses]] took his stand near the burning braziers,
holding up torches and looking at the people- brooding the while on
things that should surely come to pass. 

but minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their insolence,
for she wanted [[ulysses]] to become even more bitter against them; she
therefore set eurymachus [[son]] of polybus on to gibe at him, which made
the others laugh. "listen to me," said he, "you suitors of queen penelope,
that i may speak even as i am minded. it is not for nothing that this
man has come to the house of [[ulysses]]; i [[believe]] the [[light]] has not
been coming from the torches, but from his own head- for his hair
is all gone, every bit of it." 

then turning to [[ulysses]] he said, "stranger, will you [[work]] as a servant,
if i send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? can you
build a stone fence, or plant trees? i will have you fed all the year
round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. will you go, then?
not you; for you have got into [[bad]] ways, and do not want to [[work]];
you had rather fill your belly by going round the [[country]] begging."

"eurymachus," answered [[ulysses]], "if you and i were to [[work]] one against
the other in early summer when the days are at their longest- give
me a [[good]] scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which
will fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when
the mowing grass is about. or if you will plough against me, let us
each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of [[great]] [[strength]] and
endurance: turn me into a four acre field, and see whether you or
i can drive the straighter furrow. if, again, [[war]] were to break out
this day, give me a shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting
well upon my temples- you would find me foremost in the fray, and
would cease your gibes about my belly. you are insolent and cruel,
and [[think]] yourself a [[great]] [[man]] because you [[live]] in a little [[world]],
ind that a [[bad]] one. if [[ulysses]] comes to his own again, the doors of
his house are wide, but you will find them narrow when you try to
fly through them." 

eurymachus was furious at all this. he scowled at him and cried, "you
wretch, i will soon [[pay]] you out for daring to say such things to me,
and in [[public]] too. has the wine been getting into your head or do
you always babble in this way? you seem to have lost your wits because
you beat the tramp irus. with this he caught hold of a footstool,
but [[ulysses]] sought protection at the knees of amphinomus of dulichium,
for he was afraid. the stool hit the cupbearer on his [[right]] hand and
knocked him down: the [[man]] fell with a cry flat on his back, and his
wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. the suitors in the covered cloister
were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his neighbour, saying,
"i [[wish]] the stranger had gone somewhere else, [[bad]] [[luck]] to hide, for
all the trouble he gives us. we cannot permit such disturbance about
a beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail we shall have no more
pleasure at our banquet." 

on this telemachus came forward and said, "sirs, are you mad? can
you not carry your meat and your liquor decently? some [[evil]] spirit
has possessed you. i do not [[wish]] to drive any of you away, but you
have had your suppers, and the sooner you all go [[home]] to bed the [[better]]."

the suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his [[speech]];
but amphinomus the [[son]] of nisus, who was [[son]] to aretias, said, "do
not let us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no [[answer]].
neither let us do [[violence]] to the stranger nor to any of ulysses'
servants. let the cupbearer go round with the drink-offerings, that
we may make them and go [[home]] to our rest. as for the stranger, let
us leave telemachus to deal with him, for it is to his house that
he has come." 

thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so mulius of
dulichium, servant to amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water
and handed it round to each of them [[man]] by [[man]], whereon they made
their drink-offerings to the blessed gods: then, when they had made
their drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded, they
took their several ways each of them to his own abode.

book xix

ulysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby
with minerva's [[help]] he might be able to kill the suitors. presently
he said to telemachus, "telemachus, we must get the armour together
and take it down inside. make some excuse when the suitors ask you
why you have removed it. say that you have taken it to be out of the
way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when ulysses
went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. add to this
more particularly that you are afraid jove may set them on to quarrel
over their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may
disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes
tempts [[people]] to use them." 

telemachus approved of what his [[father]] had said, so he called nurse
euryclea and said, "nurse, shut the [[women]] up in their room, while
i take the armour that my [[father]] left behind him down into the store
room. no one looks after it now my [[father]] is gone, and it has got
all smirched with soot during my own boyhood. i want to take it down
where the smoke cannot reach it." 

"i [[wish]], child," answered euryclea, "that you would take the management
of the house into your own hands altogether, and look after all the
property yourself. but who is to go with you and [[light]] you to the
store room? the maids would have so, but you would not let them.

"the stranger," said telemachus, "shall show me a [[light]]; when people
eat my bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from."

euryclea did as she was told, and bolted the [[women]] inside their room.
then [[ulysses]] and his [[son]] made all haste to take the helmets, shields,
and spears inside; and minerva went before them with a gold lamp in
her hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon telemachus
said, "father, my [[eyes]] behold a [[great]] marvel: the walls, with the
rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow
as with a flaming [[fire]]. surely there is some [[god]] here who has come
down from [[heaven]]." 

"hush," answered [[ulysses]], "hold your [[peace]] and ask no questions [[question]], for
this is the manner of the gods. get you to your bed, and leave me
here to talk with your [[mother]] and the maids. your [[mother]] in her grief
will ask me all sorts of questions [[question]]." 

on this telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner
court, to the room in which he always slept. there he lay in his bed
till morning, while [[ulysses]] was left in the cloister pondering on
the means whereby with minerva's [[help]] he might be able to kill the
suitors. 

then penelope came down from her room looking like [[venus]] or diana,
and they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near
the [[fire]] in her accustomed place. it had been made by icmalius and
had a footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was
covered with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came
from the women's room to join her. they set about removing the tables
at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away the bread
that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. they emptied
the embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to
give both [[light]] and heat; but melantho began to rail at [[ulysses]] a
second [[time]] and said, "stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging
about the house all night and spying upon the [[women]]? be off, you wretch,
outside, and [[eat]] your supper there, or you shall be driven out with
a firebrand." 

ulysses scowled at her and answered, "my [[good]] woman, why should you
be so angry with me? is it because i am not clean, and my clothes
are all in rags, and because i am obliged to go begging about after
the manner of tramps and beggars generall? i too was a [[rich]] [[man]] once,
and had a fine house of my own; in those days i gave to many a tramp
such as i now am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. i
had any number of servants, and all the other things which people
have who [[live]] well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased jove
to take all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come
to lose that [[pride]] and place in which you now wanton above your fellows;
have a [[care]] lest you get out of favour with your mistress, and lest
ulysses should come [[home]], for there is still a [[chance]] that he may
do so. moreover, though he be [[dead]] as you [[think]] he is, yet by apollo's
will he has left a [[son]] behind him, telemachus, who will note anything
done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no longer in his
boyhood." 

penelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, "impudent
baggage, said she, "i see how abominably you are behaving, and you
shall smart for it. you knew perfectly well, for i told you myself,
that i was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband,
for whose sake i am in such continual [[sorrow]]." 

then she said to her head waiting woman eurynome, "bring a seat with
a fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his
story, and listens to what i have to say. i [[wish]] to ask him some questions [[question]]."

eurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as
soon as [[ulysses]] had sat down penelope began by saying, "stranger,
i shall first ask you who and whence are you? tell me of your town
and parents." 

"madam;" answered [[ulysses]], "who on the face of the whole [[earth]] can
dare to chide with you? your fame reaches the firmament of heaven
itself; you are like some blameless [[king]], who upholds [[righteousness]],
as the monarch over a [[great]] and valiant nation: the [[earth]] yields its
wheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring
forth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by [[reason]] of his virtues [[virtue]],
and his [[people]] do [[good]] deeds under him. nevertheless, as i sit here
in your house, ask me some other [[question]] and do not seek to know
my [[race]] and [[family]], or you will recall memories that will yet more
increase my [[sorrow]]. i am full of heaviness, but i ought not to sit
weeping and wailing in another person's house, nor is it well to be
thus grieving continually. i shall have one of the servants or even
yourself complaining of me, and saying that my [[eyes]] swim with tears
because i am heavy with wine." 

then penelope answered, "stranger, [[heaven]] robbed me of all [[beauty]],
whether of face or figure, when the argives set sail for troy and
my dear husband with them. if he were to return and look after my
affairs i should be both more respected and should show a [[better]] presence
to the [[world]]. as it is, i am [[oppressed]] with [[care]], and with the afflictions
which [[heaven]] has seen fit to heap upon me. the chiefs [[chief]] from all our
islands- dulichium, same, and zacynthus, as also from ithaca itself,
are wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. i can therefore
show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to [[people]] who
say that they are skilled artisans, but am all the [[time]] brokenhearted
about [[ulysses]]. they want me to [[marry]] again at once, and i have to
invent stratagems in order to [[deceive]] them. in the first place heaven
put it in my [[mind]] to set up a [[great]] tambour-frame in my room, and
to begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. then i
said to them, 'sweethearts, [[ulysses]] is indeed [[dead]], still, do not
press me to [[marry]] again immediately; wait- for i would not have my
skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till i have finished making
a pall for the hero laertes, to be ready against the [[time]] when death
shall take him. he is very [[rich]], and the [[women]] of the place will talk
if he is laid out without a pall.' this was what i said, and they
assented; whereon i used to keep working at my [[great]] web all day long,
but at night i would unpick the stitches again by torch [[light]]. i fooled
them in this way for three years without their finding it out, but
as [[time]] wore on and i was now in my fourth year, in the waning of
moons, and many days had been accomplished, those good-for-nothing
hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who broke in upon me
and caught me; they were very angry with me, so i was forced to finish
my [[work]] whether i would or no. and now i do not see how i can find
any further shift for getting out of this [[marriage]]. my parents are
putting [[great]] pressure upon me, and my [[son]] chafes at the ravages the
suitors are making upon his estate, for he is now old enough to understand
all about it and is perfectly able to look after his own affairs,
for [[heaven]] has blessed him with an excellent disposition. still, notwithstanding
all this, tell me who you are and where you come from- for you must
have had [[father]] and [[mother]] of some sort; you cannot be the [[son]] of
an oak or of a rock." 

then [[ulysses]] answered, "madam, [[wife]] of [[ulysses]], since you persist
in asking me about my [[family]], i will [[answer]], no matter what it costs
me: [[people]] must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as
long as i have, and [[suffered]] as much among as many peoples [[people]]. nevertheless,
as regards your [[question]] i will tell you all you ask. there is a fair
and fruitful island in mid-ocean called crete; it is thickly peopled
and there are nine cities [[city]] in it: the [[people]] speak many different languages
which overlap one another, for there are achaeans, brave eteocretans,
dorians of three-fold [[race]], and [[noble]] pelasgi. there is a [[great]] town
there, cnossus, where minos reigned who every nine years had a conference
with jove himself. minos was [[father]] to deucalion, whose [[son]] i am,
for deucalion had two sons [[son]] idomeneus and myself. idomeneus sailed
for troy, and i, who am the younger, am called aethon; my [[brother]],
however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two; hence
it was in crete that i saw [[ulysses]] and showed him hospitality, for
the winds took him there as he was on his way to troy, carrying him
out of his course from cape malea and leaving him in amnisus off the
cave of ilithuia, where the harbours are difficult to enter and he
could hardly find shelter from the winds that were then xaging. as
soon as he got there he went into the town and [[asked]] for idomeneus,
claiming to be his old and valued friend, but idomeneus had already
set sail for troy some ten or twelve days earlier, so i took him to
my own house and showed him every [[kind]] of hospitality, for i had abundance
of everything. moreover, i fed the [[men]] who were with him with barley
meal from the [[public]] store, and got subscriptions of wine and oxen
for them to [[sacrifice]] to their heart's content. they stayed with me
twelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the north so strong
that one could hardly keep one's feet on [[land]]. i suppose some unfriendly
god had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the wind dropped,
and they got away." 

many a plausible tale did [[ulysses]] further tell her, and penelope wept
as she listened, for her [[heart]] was melted. as the snow wastes upon
the mountain tops when the winds from south east and west have breathed
upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even
so did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all
the [[time]] sitting by her side. [[ulysses]] [[felt]] for her and was for her,
but he kept his [[eyes]] as hard as or iron without letting them so much
as quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. then, when she
had relieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said:
"now, stranger, i shall put you to the test and see whether or no
you really did entertain my husband and his [[men]], as you say you did.
tell me, then, how he was dressed, what [[kind]] of a [[man]] he was to look
at, and so also with his companions." 

"madam," answered [[ulysses]], "it is such a long [[time]] ago that i can
hardly say. twenty years are come and gone since he left my [[home]],
and went elsewhither; but i will tell you as well as i can recollect.
ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened
by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. on the face of this
there was a device that showed a dog holding a spotted fawn between
his fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground.
every one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done
in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the
fawn was struggling convulsively to escape. as for the shirt that
he wore next his skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the
skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration
of all the [[women]] who beheld it. furthermore i say, and lay my saying
to your [[heart]], that i do not [[know]] whether [[ulysses]] wore these clothes
when he left [[home]], or whether one of his companions had given them
to him while he was on his [[voyage]]; or possibly some one at whose house
he was staying made him a [[present]] of them, for he was a [[man]] of many
friends and had few equals [[equal]] among the achaeans. i myself gave him a
sword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with
a shirt that went down to his feet, and i sent him on board his ship
with every mark of [[honour]]. he had a servant with him, a little older
than himself, and i can tell you what he was like; his shoulders were
hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair. his name was eurybates,
and [[ulysses]] treated him with greater familiarity than he did any of
the others, as being the most like-minded with himself."

penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable
proofs that [[ulysses]] laid before her; and when she had again found
relief in tears she said to him, "stranger, i was already disposed
to [[pity]] you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome
in my house. it was i who gave [[ulysses]] the clothes you speak of. i
took them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and i gave
him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. alas! i shall never
welcome him [[home]] again. it was by an ill [[fate]] that he ever set out
for that detested [[city]] whose very name i cannot bring myself even
to mention." 

then [[ulysses]] answered, "madam, [[wife]] of [[ulysses]], do not disfigure yourself
further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though i can hardly
blame you for doing so. a woman who has loved her husband and borne
him [[children]], would naturally be [[grieved]] at losing him, even though
he were a worse [[man]] than [[ulysses]], who they say was like a [[god]]. still,
cease your tears and listen to what i can tell i will hide nothing
from you, and can say with [[perfect]] [[truth]] that i have lately heard
of [[ulysses]] as being alive and on his way [[home]]; he is among the thesprotians,
and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has begged from
one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were lost as
they were leaving the thrinacian island, for jove and the sun-god
were angry with him because his [[men]] had slaughtered the sun-god's
cattle, and they were all drowned to a [[man]]. but [[ulysses]] stuck to the
keel of the ship and was drifted on to the [[land]] of the phaecians,
who are near of kin to the immortals [[immortal]], and who treated him as though
he had been a [[god]], giving him many presents [[present]], and wishing to escort
him [[home]] safe and sound. in [[fact]] [[ulysses]] would have been here long
ago, had he not [[thought]] [[better]] to go from [[land]] to [[land]] gathering [[wealth]];
for there is no [[man]] living who is so wily as he is; there is no one
can compare with him. pheidon [[king]] of the thesprotians told me all
this, and he swore to me- making drink-offerings in his house as he
did so- that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who
would take [[ulysses]] to his own [[country]]. he sent me off first, for there
happened to be a thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island
of dulichium, but he showed me all treasure [[ulysses]] had got together,
and he had enough lying in the house of [[king]] pheidon to keep his family
for ten generations [[generation]]; but the [[king]] said [[ulysses]] had gone to dodona
that he might learn jove's [[mind]] from the high oak tree, and [[know]] whether
after so long an absence he should return to ithaca openly or in secret.
so you may [[know]] he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at
hand and cannot remain away from [[home]] much longer; nevertheless i
will confirm my words with an oath, and call jove who is the first
and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of ulysses
to which i have now come, that all i have spoken shall surely come
to pass. [[ulysses]] will return in this [[self]] same year; with the end
of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here."

"may it be even so," answered penelope; "if your words come true you
shall have such gifts and such [[good]] will from me that all who see
you shall congratulate you; but i [[know]] very well how it will be. ulysses
will not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely
as that [[ulysses]] ever was, there are now no longer any such masters
in the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further
them on their way [[home]]. and now, you maids, wash his feet for him,
and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may
be warm and quiet till morning. then, at day break wash him and anoint
him again, that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with
telemachus. it shall be the worse for any one of these hateful people
who is uncivil to him; like it or not, he shall have no more to do
in this house. for how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether or
no i am superior to others of my [[sex]] both in goodness of [[heart]] and
understanding, if i let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad?
men [[live]] but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal hardly,
people [[wish]] them ill so long as they are alive, and speak contemptuously
of them when they are [[dead]], but he that is righteous and deals righteously,
the [[people]] tell of his [[praise]] among all lands [[land]], and many shall call
him blessed." 

ulysses answered, "madam, i have foresworn rugs and blankets from
the day that i left the snowy ranges of crete to go on shipboard.
i will [[lie]] as i have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. night
after night have i passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited
for morning. nor, again, do i like having my feet washed; i shall
not let any of the [[young]] hussies about your house touch my feet; but,
if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as
much trouble as i have, i will allow her to wash them." 

to this penelope said, "my dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet
came to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with
such admirable propriety as you do. there happens to be in the house
a most respectable old woman- the same who received my [[poor]] dear husband
in her arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. she
is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet." "come here," said
she, "euryclea, and wash your master's age-mate; i suppose ulysses'
hands and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble
ages all of us dreadfully fast." 

on these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she
began to weep and made lamentation saying, "my dear child, i cannot
think whatever i am to do with you. i am [[certain]] no one was ever more
god-fearing than yourself, and yet jove hates you. no one in the whole
world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs
when you prayed you might come to a green old [[age]] yourself and see
your [[son]] grow up to take after you; yet see how he has prevented you
alone from ever getting back to your own [[home]]. i have no [[doubt]] the
women in some [[foreign]] palace which [[ulysses]] has got to are gibing at
him as all these sluts here have been gibing you. i do not wonder
at your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which
they have insulted you; i will wash your feet myself gladly enough,
as penelope has said that i am to do so; i will wash them both for
penelope's sake and for your own, for you have raised the most lively
feelings of compassion in my [[mind]]; and let me say this moreover, which
pray attend to; we have had all kinds [[kind]] of strangers in distress come
here before now, but i make bold to say that no one ever yet came
who was so like [[ulysses]] in figure, voice, and feet as you are."

"those who have seen us both," answered [[ulysses]], "have always said
we were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.

then the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash
his feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till
the bath was warm enough. [[ulysses]] sat by the [[fire]], but ere long he
turned away from the [[light]], for it occurred to him that when the old
woman had hold of his leg she would recognize a [[certain]] scar which
it bore, whereon the whole [[truth]] would come out. and indeed as soon
as she began washing her master, she at once knew the scar as one
that had been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on mount
parnassus with his excellent grandfather autolycus- who was the most
accomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world- and with the sons
of autolycus. mercury himself had endowed him with this gift, for
he used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him, so he took
pleasure in his companionship. it happened once that autolycus had
gone to ithaca and had found the child of his [[daughter]] just born.
as soon as he had done supper euryclea set the infant upon his knees
and said, you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wished
that you might have one." 

'son-in-law and [[daughter]]," replied autolycus, "call the child thus:
i am highly displeased with a large number of [[people]] in one place
and another, both [[men]] and [[women]]; so name the child 'ulysses,' or the
child of anger. when he grows up and comes to visit his mother's family
on mount parnassus, where my possessions [[lie]], i will make him a present
and will send him on his way rejoicing." 

ulysses, therefore, went to parnassus to get the presents [[present]] from autolycus,
who with his sons [[son]] shook hands with him and gave him welcome. his grandmother
amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head, and both
his beautiful [[eyes]], while autolycus [[desired]] his sons [[son]] to get dinner
ready, and they did as he told them. they brought in a five year old
bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints; these they
then cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted
them sufficiently and served the portions round. thus through the
livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and every
man had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun
set and it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of
sleep. 

when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, the sons
of autolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and [[ulysses]] went
too. they climbed the wooded slopes of parnassus and soon reached
its breezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon
the fields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of oceanus, they
came to a mountain dell. the dogs were in front searching for the
tracks of the beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons
of autolycus, among whom was [[ulysses]], close behind the dogs, and he
had a long spear in his hand. here was the lair of a huge boar among
some thick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get
through it, nor could the sun's rays pierce it, and the ground underneath
lay thick with fallen leaves. the boar heard the noise of the men's
feet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up
to him, so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck,
and stood at bay with [[fire]] flashing from his [[eyes]]. [[ulysses]] was the
first to raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the
boar was too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him
above the knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach
the bone. as for the boar, [[ulysses]] hit him on the [[right]] shoulder,
and the point of the spear went [[right]] through him, so that he fell
groaning in the dust until the [[life]] went out of him. the sons [[son]] of autolycus
busied themselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound ulysses'
wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went
home as fast as they could. but when autolycus and his sons [[son]] had thoroughly
healed [[ulysses]], they made him some splendid presents [[present]], and sent him
back to ithaca with much mutual [[good]] will. when he got back, his father
and [[mother]] were rejoiced to see him, and [[asked]] him all about it, and
how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how the boar
had ripped him when he was out hunting with autolycus and his sons
on mount parnassus. 

as soon as euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had
well hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at once. the
leg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that
all the water was spilt on the ground; euryclea's [[eyes]] between her
joy and her [[grief]] filled with tears, and she could not speak, but
she caught [[ulysses]] by the beard and said, "my dear child, i am sure
you must be [[ulysses]] himself, only i did not [[know]] you till i had actually
touched and handled you." 

as she spoke she looked towards penelope, as though wanting to tell
her that her dear husband was in the house, but penelope was unable
to look in that direction and observe what was going on, for minerva
had diverted her attention; so [[ulysses]] caught euryclea by the throat
with his [[right]] hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said,
"nurse, do you [[wish]] to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your
own breast, now that after twenty years of wandering i am at last
come to my own [[home]] again? since it has been borne in upon you by
heaven to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about
it any one else in the house, for if you do i tell you- and it shall
surely be- that if [[heaven]] grants me to take the lives [[life]] of these suitors,
i will not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when i am killing
the other [[women]]." 

"my child," answered euryclea, "what are you talking about? you know
very well that nothing can either bend or break me. i will hold my
tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and
lay my saying to your [[heart]], when [[heaven]] has delivered the suitors
into your hand, i will give you a list of the [[women]] in the house who
have been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless." 

and [[ulysses]] answered, "nurse, you ought not to speak in that way;
i am well able to form my own [[opinion]] about one and all of them; hold
your tongue and leave everything to [[heaven]]." 

as he said this euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,
for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and
anointed him with [[oil]], [[ulysses]] drew his seat nearer to the [[fire]] to
warm himself, and hid the scar under his rags. then penelope began
talking to him and said: 

"stranger, i should like to speak with you briefly about another matter.
it is indeed nearly bed time- for those, at least, who can sleep in
spite of [[sorrow]]. as for myself, [[heaven]] has given me a [[life]] of such
unmeasurable woe, that even by day when i am attending to my duties
and looking after the servants, i am still weeping and lamenting during
the whole [[time]]; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed,
i [[lie]] awake thinking, and my [[heart]] comes a prey to the most incessant
and cruel tortures. as the dun nightingale, [[daughter]] of pandareus,
sings in the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and
with many a plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed
her own child itylus, [[son]] of [[king]] zethus, even so does my [[mind]] toss
and turn in its uncertainty whether i ought to stay with my [[son]] here,
and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house,
out of regard to [[public]] [[opinion]] and the memory of my late husband,
or whether it is not now [[time]] for me to go with the [[best]] of these
suitors who are wooing me and making me such magnificent presents [[present]].
as long as my [[son]] was still [[young]], and unable to [[understand]], he would
not hear of my leaving my husband's house, but now that he is full
grown he begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way in
which the suitors are eating up his [[property]]. listen, then, to a dream
that i have had and interpret it for me if you can. i have twenty
geese about the house that [[eat]] mash out of a trough, and of which
i am exceedingly fond. i dreamed that a [[great]] eagle came swooping
down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into the neck of each
of them till he had killed them all. presently he soared off into
the [[sky]], and left them lying [[dead]] about the yard; whereon i wept in
my room till all my maids gathered round me, so piteously was i grieving
because the eagle had killed my geese. then he came back again, and
perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with [[human]] voice, and
told me to leave off crying. 'be of [[good]] [[courage]],' he said, 'daughter
of icarius; this is no [[dream]], but a vision of [[good]] omen that shall
surely come to pass. the geese are the suitors, and i am no longer
an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who will
bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.' on this i woke, and when
i looked out i saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual."

"this [[dream]], madam," replied [[ulysses]], "can admit but of one interpretation,
for had not [[ulysses]] himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? the
death of the suitors is portended, and not one [[single]] one of them
will escape." 

and penelope answered, "stranger, dreams [[dream]] are very [[curious]] and unaccountable
things, and they do not by any means invariably come true. there are
two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed; the one
is of horn, and the other ivory. those that come through the gate
of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean something
to those that see them. i do not [[think]], however, that my own dream
came through the gate of horn, though i and my [[son]] should be most
thankful if it proves to have done so. furthermore i say- and lay
my saying to your heart- the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened
day that is to sever me from the house of [[ulysses]], for i am about
to hold a tournament of axes. my husband used to set up twelve axes
in the court, one in front of the other, like the stays upon which
a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot an arrow
through the whole twelve. i shall make the suitors try to do the same
thing, and whichever of them can string the bow most easily, and send
his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will i [[follow]], and quit
this house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in [[wealth]].
but even so, i [[doubt]] not that i shall [[remember]] it in my dreams [[dream]]."

then [[ulysses]] answered, "madam [[wife]] of [[ulysses]], you need not defer
your tournament, for [[ulysses]] will return ere ever they can string
the bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the
iron." 

to this penelope said, "as long, sir, as you will sit here and talk
to me, i can have no [[desire]] to go to bed. still, [[people]] cannot do
permanently without sleep, and [[heaven]] has appointed us dwellers on
earth a [[time]] for all things. i will therefore go upstairs and recline
upon that couch which i have never ceased to flood with my tears from
the day [[ulysses]] set out for the [[city]] with a hateful name."

she then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by
her maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till minerva
shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.

book xx

ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock's hide, on
the top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had
eaten, and eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself
down. there, then, [[ulysses]] lay wakefully brooding upon the way in
which he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the [[women]] who had
been in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the
house giggling and laughing with one another. this made [[ulysses]] very
angry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every [[single]] one
of them then and there, or to let them sleep one more and [[last]] time
with the suitors. his [[heart]] growled within him, and as a bitch with
puppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did
his [[heart]] growl with anger at the [[evil]] deeds that were being done:
but he beat his breast and said, "heart, be still, you had worse than
this to bear on the day when the terrible cyclops ate your brave companions;
yet you bore it in [[silence]] till your cunning got you safe out of the
cave, though you made sure of being killed." 

thus he chided with his [[heart]], and checked it into endurance, but
he tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of [[blood]] and fat in
front of a hot [[fire]], doing it first on one side and then on the other,
that he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn
himself about from side to side, thinking all the [[time]] how, single
handed as he was, he should contrive to kill so large a [[body]] of men
as the wicked suitors. but by and by minerva came down from heaven
in the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, "my
poor unhappy [[man]], why do you [[lie]] awake in this way? this is your house:
your [[wife]] is safe inside it, and so is your [[son]] who is just such a
young [[man]] as any [[father]] may be proud of." 

"goddess," answered [[ulysses]], "all that you have said is true, but
i am in some [[doubt]] as to how i shall be able to kill these wicked
suitors [[single]] handed, seeing what a number of them there always are.
and there is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable.
supposing that with jove's and your assistance i succeed in killing
them, i must ask you to consider where i am to escape to from their
avengers when it is all over." 

"for shame," replied minerva, "why, any one else would trust a worse
ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less
wise than i am. am i not a [[goddess]], and have i not protected you throughout
in all your troubles? i tell you plainly that even though there were
fifty bands of [[men]] surrounding us and eager to kill us, you should
take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you. but
go to sleep; it is a very [[bad]] thing to [[lie]] awake all night, and you
shall be out of your troubles before long." 

as she spoke she shed sleep over his [[eyes]], and then went back to [[olympus]].

while [[ulysses]] was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that
eased the burden of his sorrows [[sorrow]], his admirable [[wife]] awoke, and sitting
up in her bed began to cry. when she had relieved herself by weeping
she prayed to diana saying, "great [[goddess]] diana, [[daughter]] of jove,
drive an arrow into my [[heart]] and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch
me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the
mouths of overflowing oceanus, as it did the daughters [[daughter]] of pandareus.
the daughters [[daughter]] of pandareus lost their [[father]] and [[mother]], for the gods
killed them, so they were left orphans. but [[venus]] took [[care]] of them,
and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. juno taught them to
excel all [[women]] in [[beauty]] of form and understanding; diana gave them
an imposing presence, and minerva endowed them with every [[kind]] of
accomplishment; but one day when [[venus]] had gone up to [[olympus]] to see
jove about getting them [[married]] (for well does he [[know]] both what shall
happen and what not happen to every one) the storm winds came and
spirited them away to become handmaids to the dread erinyes. even
so i [[wish]] that the gods who [[live]] in [[heaven]] would hide me from mortal
sight, or that [[fair]] diana might strike me, for i would fain go even
beneath the [[sad]] [[earth]] if i might do so still looking towards ulysses
only, and without having to yield myself to a worse [[man]] than he was.
besides, no matter how much [[people]] may grieve by day, they can put
up with it so long as they can sleep at night, for when the [[eyes]] are
closed in slumber [[people]] forget [[good]] and ill alike; whereas my misery
haunts me even in my dreams [[dream]]. this very night methought there was one
lying by my side who was like [[ulysses]] as he was when he went away
with his host, and i rejoiced, for i believed that it was no [[dream]],
but the very [[truth]] itself." 

on this the day broke, but [[ulysses]] heard the sound of her weeping,
and it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and
was by his side. then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on
which he had lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he
took the bullock's hide out into the open. he lifted up his hands
to [[heaven]], and prayed, saying "father jove, since you have seen fit
to bring me over [[land]] and sea to my own [[home]] after all the afflictions
you have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one
or other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me
have another sign of some [[kind]] from outside." 

thus did he [[pray]]. jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high
up among the from the splendour of [[olympus]], and [[ulysses]] was glad when
he heard it. at the same [[time]] within the house, a miller-woman from
hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another
sign. there were twelve miller-women whose [[business]] it was to grind
wheat and barley which are the staff of [[life]]. the others had ground
their task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet
finished, for she was not so [[strong]] as they were, and when she heard
the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.
"father jove," said she, "you who [[rule]] over [[heaven]] and [[earth]], you
have thundered from a clear [[sky]] without so much as a cloud in it,
and this means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of
me your [[poor]] servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very
last day that the suitors dine in the house of [[ulysses]]. they have
worn me out with the [[labour]] of grinding meal for them, and i hope
they may never have another dinner anywhere at all." 

ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman's
speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should
avenge himself on the suitors. 

then the other maids in the house rose and lit the [[fire]] on the hearth;
telemachus also rose and put on his clothes. he girded his [[sword]] about
his shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, and took a doughty
spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold
of the cloister and said to euryclea, "nurse, did you make the stranger
comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him shift
for himself?- for my [[mother]], [[good]] woman though she is, has a way of
paying [[great]] attention to second-rate [[people]], and of neglecting others
who are in reality much [[better]] [[men]]." 

"do not find [[fault]] child," said euryclea, "when there is no one to
find [[fault]] with. the stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he
liked: your [[mother]] did ask him if he would take any more bread and
he said he would not. when he wanted to go to bed she told the servants
to make one for him, but he said he was re such wretched outcast that
he would not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having
an undressed bullock's hide and some sheepskins put for him in the
cloister and i threw a cloak over him myself." 

then telemachus went out of the court to the place where the achaeans
were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was
not alone, for his two dogs went with him. but euryclea called the
maids and said, "come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and
sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the
seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean
out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and for water from the fountain
at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early,
for it is a feast day." 

thus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them
went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily
to [[work]] about the house. the [[men]] who were in attendance on the suitors
also came up and began chopping firewood. by and by the [[women]] returned
from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three
best pigs he could pick out. these he let feed about the premises,
and then he said good-humouredly to [[ulysses]], "stranger, are the suitors
treating you any [[better]] now, or are they as insolent as ever?"

"may [[heaven]]," answered [[ulysses]], "requite to them the wickedness with
which they deal high-handedly in another man's [[man]] house without any sense
of shame." 

thus did they converse; meanwhile melanthius the goatherd came up,
for he too was bringing in his [[best]] goats for the suitors' dinner;
and he had two shepherds with him. they tied the goats up under the
gatehouse, and then melanthius began gibing at [[ulysses]]. "are you still
here, stranger," said he, "to pester [[people]] by begging about the house?
why can you not go elsewhere? you and i shall not come to an understanding
before we have given each other a taste of our fists. you beg without
any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the achaeans,
as well as here?" 

ulysses made no [[answer]], but bowed his head and brooded. then a third
man, philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer
and some goats. these were brought over by the boatmen who are there
to take [[people]] over when any one comes to them. so philoetius made
his heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went
up to the swineherd. "who, swineherd," said he, "is this stranger
that is lately come here? is he one of your [[men]]? what is his [[family]]?
where does he come from? [[poor]] fellow, he looks as if he had been some
great [[man]], but the gods give [[sorrow]] to whom they will- even to kings
if it so pleases them 

as he spoke he went up to [[ulysses]] and saluted him with his [[right]] hand;
"good day to you, [[father]] stranger," said he, "you seem to be very
poorly off now, but i [[hope]] you will have [[better]] times [[time]] by and by. father
jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. we are your own [[children]],
yet you show us no [[mercy]] in all our misery and afflictions. a sweat
came over me when i saw this [[man]], and my [[eyes]] filled with tears, for
he reminds me of [[ulysses]], who i [[fear]] is going about in just such rags
as this man's [[man]] are, if indeed he is still among the living. if he is
already [[dead]] and in the house of [[hades]], then, alas! for my [[good]] master,
who made me his stockman when i was quite [[young]] among the cephallenians,
and now his cattle are countless; no one could have done [[better]] with
them than i have, for they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless
i have to keep bringing them in for others to [[eat]], who take no heed
of his [[son]] though he is in the house, and [[fear]] not the wrath of [[heaven]],
but are already eager to divide ulysses' [[property]] among them because
he has been away so long. i have often thought- only it would not
be [[right]] while his [[son]] is living- of going off with the cattle to
some [[foreign]] [[country]]; [[bad]] as this would be, it is still harder to
stay here and be ill-treated about other people's herds. my position
is intolerable, and i should long since have run away and put myself
under the protection of some other [[chief]], only that i [[believe]] my poor
master will yet return, and send all these suitors flying out of the
house." 

"stockman," answered [[ulysses]], "you seem to be a very well-disposed
person, and i can see that you are a [[man]] of sense. therefore i will
tell you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by jove, the chief
of all gods, and by that hearth of [[ulysses]] to which i am now come,
ulysses shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so
minded you shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here."

"if jove were to bring this to pass," replied the stockman, "you should
see how i would do my very utmost to [[help]] him." 

and in like manner eumaeus prayed that [[ulysses]] might return [[home]].

thus did they converse. meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot
to murder telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand-
an eagle with a dove in its talons. on this amphinomus said, "my [[friends]],
this plot of ours to murder telemachus will not succeed; let us go
to dinner instead." 

the others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on
the benches and seats. they sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and
the heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them
round. they mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd
gave every [[man]] his cup, while philoetius handed round the bread in
the breadbaskets, and melanthius poured them out their wine. then
they laid their hands upon the [[good]] things that were before them.

telemachus purposely made [[ulysses]] sit in the part of the cloister
that was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a
little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought
to him, with his wine in a gold cup. "sit there," said he, "and drink
your wine among the [[great]] [[people]]. i will put a stop to the gibes and
blows of the suitors, for this is no [[public]] house, but belongs to
ulysses, and has passed from him to me. therefore, suitors, keep your
hands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be mischief."

the suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his [[speech]];
then antinous said, "we do not like such [[language]] but we will put
up with it, for telemachus is threatening us in [[good]] earnest. if jove
had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now."

thus spoke antinous, but telemachus heeded him not. meanwhile the
heralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the [[city]], and the
achaeans gathered under the shady grove of [[apollo]]. 

then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every
man his portion, and feasted to their hearts' content; those who waited
at table gave [[ulysses]] exactly the same portion as the others had,
for telemachus had told them to do so. 

but minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence,
for she wanted [[ulysses]] to become still more bitter against them. now
there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was ctesippus,
and who came from same. this [[man]], confident in his [[great]] [[wealth]], was
paying court to the [[wife]] of [[ulysses]], and said to the suitors, "hear
what i have to say. the stranger has already had as large a portion
as any one else; this is well, for it is not [[right]] nor reasonable
to ill-treat any guest of telemachus who comes here. i will, however,
make him a [[present]] on my own account, that he may have something to
give to the bath-woman, or to some other of ulysses' servants."

as he spoke he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket in which
it lay, and threw it at [[ulysses]], but [[ulysses]] turned his head a little
aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly sardinian [[fashion]] as he did
so, and it hit the wall, not him. on this telemachus spoke fiercely
to ctesippus, "it is a [[good]] thing for you," said he, "that the stranger
turned his head so that you missed him. if you had hit him i should
have run you through with my spear, and your [[father]] would have had
to see about getting you buried rather than [[married]] in this house.
so let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for i am
grown up now to the [[knowledge]] of [[good]] and [[evil]] and [[understand]] what
is going on, instead of being the child that i have been heretofore.
i have long seen you killing my sheep and making [[free]] with my corn
and wine: i have put up with this, for one [[man]] is no match for many,
but do me no further [[violence]]. still, if you [[wish]] to kill me, kill
me; i would far rather [[die]] than see such disgraceful scenes day after
day- guests insulted, and [[men]] dragging the [[women]] servants about the
house in an unseemly way." 

they all held their [[peace]] till at [[last]] agelaus [[son]] of damastor said,
"no one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay
it, for it is quite reasonable. leave off, therefore, ill-treating
the stranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house;
i would say, however, a friendly word to telemachus and his [[mother]],
which i trust may commend itself to both. 'as long,' i would say,
'as you had ground for hoping that [[ulysses]] would one day come [[home]],
no one could [[complain]] of your waiting and suffering the suitors to
be in your house. it would have been [[better]] that he should have returned,
but it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore
talk all this quietly over with your [[mother]], and tell her to marry
the [[best]] [[man]], and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer.
thus you will yourself be able to manage your own [[inheritance]], and
to [[eat]] and drink in [[peace]], while your [[mother]] will look after some
other man's [[man]] house, not yours."' 

to this telemachus answered, "by jove, agelaus, and by the sorrows
of my unhappy [[father]], who has either perished far from ithaca, or
is wandering in some distant [[land]], i throw no obstacles in the way
of my mother's [[marriage]]; on the contrary i urge her to choose whomsoever
she will, and i will give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but
i dare not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against
her own wishes [[wish]]. [[heaven]] forbid that i should do this." 

minerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set
their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.
their meat became smeared with [[blood]]; their [[eyes]] filled with tears,
and their hearts [[heart]] were heavy with forebodings. theoclymenus saw this
and said, "unhappy [[men]], what is it that ails you? there is a shroud
of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet
with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams
drip [[blood]]; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are
full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted
out of [[heaven]], and a blighting gloom is over all the [[land]]."

thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. eurymachus
then said, "this stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses.
servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark
here." 

but theoclymenus said, "eurymachus, you need not send any one with
me. i have [[eyes]], ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing
of an understanding [[mind]]. i will take these out of the house with
me, for i see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you
men who are insulting [[people]] and plotting ill deeds in the house of
ulysses will be able to escape." 

he left the house as he spoke, and went back to piraeus who gave him
welcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking
telemachus fly laughing at the strangers. one insolent fellow said
to him, "telemachus, you are not [[happy]] in your guests; first you have
this importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no
skill for [[work]] or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and
now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as a [[prophet]].
let me persuade you, for it will be much [[better]], to put them on board
ship and send them off to the sicels to sell for what they will bring."

telemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his [[father]],
expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.

meanwhile the [[daughter]] of icarius, [[wise]] penelope, had had had a rich
seat placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could
hear what every one was saying. the dinner indeed had been prepared
amid merriment; it had been both [[good]] and abundant, for they had sacrificed
many victims; but the supper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived
more gruesome than the meal which a [[goddess]] and a brave [[man]] were soon
to lay before them- for they had brought their doom upon themselves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book xxi

minerva now put it in penelope's [[mind]] to make the suitors try their
skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves,
as a means of bringing about their destruction. she went upstairs
and got the store room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle
of ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store room at the
end of the house, where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and
wrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver
full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he
had met in lacedaemon- iphitus the [[son]] of eurytus. the two fell in
with one another in messene at the house of ortilochus, where ulysses
was staying in order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole
people; for the messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from
ithaca, and had sailed away with them and with their shepherds. in
quest of these [[ulysses]] took a long [[journey]] while still quite [[young]],
for his [[father]] and the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover
them. iphitus had gone there also to try and get back twelve brood
mares that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running with
them. these mares were the [[death]] of him in the end, for when he went
to the house of jove's [[son]], mighty hercules, who performed such prodigies
of valour, hercules to his shame killed him, though he was his guest,
for he feared not heaven's vengeance, nor yet respected his own table
which he had set before iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything,
and kept the mares himself. it was when claiming these that iphitus
met [[ulysses]], and gave him the bow which mighty eurytus had been used
to carry, and which on his [[death]] had been left by him to his [[son]].
ulysses gave him in return a [[sword]] and a spear, and this was the beginning
of a fast [[friendship]], although they never visited at one another's
houses, for jove's [[son]] hercules killed iphitus ere they could do so.
this bow, then, given him by iphitus, had not been taken with him
by [[ulysses]] when he sailed for troy; he had used it so long as he had
been at [[home]], but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from
a valued friend. 

penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store room; the
carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to
get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and
hung the doors. she loosed the strap from the handle of the door,
put in the key, and drove it straight [[home]] to shoot back the bolts
that held the doors; these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing
in a meadow, and penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where
the chests stood in which the [[fair]] linen and clothes were laid by
along with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow
with its bow case from the peg on which it hung. she sat down with
it on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case,
and when her tears had relieved her, she went to the cloister where
the suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly
arrows that were inside it. along with her came her maidens, bearing
a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her husband had
won as prizes. when she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the
bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil
before her face, and with a maid on either side of her. then she said:

"listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality
of this house because its owner has been long absent, and without
other pretext than that you want to [[marry]] me; this, then, being the
prize that you are contending for, i will bring out the mighty bow
of [[ulysses]], and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and
send his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will i follow
and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding
in [[wealth]]. but even so i [[doubt]] not that i shall [[remember]] it in my
dreams." 

as she spoke, she told eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron
before the suitors, and eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she
had bidden him. hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master's
bow, but antinous scolded them. "you [[country]] louts," said he, "silly
simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows [[sorrow]] of your mistress by
crying in this way? she has enough to grieve her in the loss of her
husband; sit still, therefore, and [[eat]] your dinners in [[silence]], or
go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. we suitors
shall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find
it no [[light]] matter to string such a bow as this is. there is not a
man of us all who is such another as [[ulysses]]; for i have seen him
and [[remember]] him, though i was then only a child." 

this was what he said, but all the [[time]] he was expecting to be able
to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in [[fact]] he was
to be the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of
ulysses, whom he was dishonouring in his own house- egging the others
on to do so also. 

then telemachus spoke. "great heavens!" he exclaimed, "jove must have
robbed me of my senses. here is my dear and excellent [[mother]] saying
she will quit this house and [[marry]] again, yet i am laughing and enjoying
myself as though there were nothing happening. but, suitors, as the
contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. it is for a woman
whose peer is not to be found in pylos, argos, or mycene, nor yet
in ithaca nor on the mainland. you [[know]] this as well as i do; what
need have i to speak in [[praise]] of my [[mother]]? come on, then, make no
excuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or
no. i too will make [[trial]] of it, for if i can string it and shoot
through the iron, i shall not suffer my [[mother]] to quit this house
with a stranger, not if i can [[win]] the prizes which my [[father]] won before
me." 

as he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from
him, and took his [[sword]] from his shoulder. first he set the axes in
a row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had wade straight
by line. then he stamped the [[earth]] tight round them, and everyone
was surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though he had never
seen anything of the [[kind]] before. this done, he went on to the pavement
to make [[trial]] of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all
his might to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though
he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. he was
trying for the fourth [[time]], and would have strung it had not ulysses
made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. so he said:

"alas! i shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or i am
too [[young]], and have not yet reached my full [[strength]] so as to be able
to hold my own if any one attacks me. you others, therefore, who are
stronger than i, make [[trial]] of the bow and get this contest settled."

on this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that
led into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the
bow. then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and antinous
said: 

"come on each of you in his turn, going towards the [[right]] from the
place at which the. cupbearer begins when he is handing round the
wine." 

the rest agreed, and leiodes [[son]] of oenops was the first to rise.
he was sacrificial [[priest]] to the suitors, and sat in the corner near
the mixing-bowl. he was the only [[man]] who hated their [[evil]] deeds and
was indignant with the others. he was now the first to take the bow
and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his [[trial]], but he
could not string the bow, for his hands were [[weak]] and unused to hard
work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors,
"my [[friends]], i cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shall
take the [[life]] and [[soul]] out of many a [[chief]] among us, for it is better
to [[die]] than to [[live]] after having missed the prize that we have so
long striven for, and which has brought us so long together. some
one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may [[marry]] penelope,
but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo and make bridal
offerings to some other woman, and let penelope [[marry]] whoever makes
her the [[best]] offer and whose lot it is to [[win]] her." 

on this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, with
the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. then he took his seat
again on the seat from which he had risen; and antinous rebuked him
saying: 

"leiodes, what are you talking about? your words are monstrous and
intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. shall, then, this
bow take the [[life]] of many a [[chief]] among us, merely because you cannot
bend it yourself? true, you were not born to be an archer, but there
are others who will soon string it." 

then he said to melanthius the goatherd, "look sharp, [[light]] a fire
in the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring
us also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. let
us warm the bow and grease it we will then make [[trial]] of it again,
and bring the contest to an end." 

melanthius lit the [[fire]], and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside
it. he also brought a [[great]] ball of lard from what they had in the
house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made [[trial]] of it,
but they were none of them nearly [[strong]] enough to string it. nevertheless
there still remained antinous and eurymachus, who were the ringleaders
among the suitors and much the foremost among them all. 

then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and
ulysses followed them. when they had got outside the gates and the
outer yard, [[ulysses]] said to them quietly: 

"stockman, and you swineherd, i have something in my [[mind]] which i
am in [[doubt]] whether to say or no; but i [[think]] i will say it. what
manner of [[men]] would you be to stand by [[ulysses]], if some [[god]] should
bring him back here all of a sudden? say which you are disposed to
do- to side with the suitors, or with [[ulysses]]?" 

"father jove," answered the stockman, "would indeed that you might
so ordain it. if some [[god]] were but to bring [[ulysses]] back, you should
see with what might and main i would [[fight]] for him." 

in like words eumaeus prayed to all the gods that [[ulysses]] might return;
when, therefore, he saw for [[certain]] what [[mind]] they were of, ulysses
said, "it is i, [[ulysses]], who am here. i have [[suffered]] much, but at
last, in the twentieth year, i am come back to my own [[country]]. i find
that you two alone of all my servants are glad that i should do so,
for i have not heard any of the others praying for my return. to you
two, therefore, will i unfold the [[truth]] as it shall be. if heaven
shall deliver the suitors into my hands, i will find wives [[wife]] for both
of you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall
be to me as though you were brothers [[brother]] and [[friends]] of telemachus. i
will now give you convincing proofs that you may [[know]] me and be assured.
see, here is the scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when i
was out hunting on mount parnassus with the sons [[son]] of autolycus."

as he spoke he drew his rags aside from the [[great]] scar, and when they
had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about [[ulysses]],
threw their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, while
ulysses kissed their hands and faces in return. the sun would have
gone down upon their mourning if [[ulysses]] had not checked them and
said: 

"cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us,
and tell those who a are within. when you go in, do so separately,
not both together; i will go first, and do you [[follow]] afterwards;
let this moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of
them try to prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do
you, therefore, eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying
it about, and tell the [[women]] to close the doors of their apartment.
if they hear any groaning or uproar as of [[men]] fighting about the house,
they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they
are at their [[work]]. and i charge you, philoetius, to make fast the
doors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once."

when he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat
that he had left. presently, his two servants followed him inside.

at this moment the bow was in the hands of eurymachus, who was warming
it by the [[fire]], but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly
grieved. he heaved a deep sigh and said, "i grieve for myself and
for us all; i grieve that i shall have to forgo the [[marriage]], but
i do not [[care]] nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other
women in ithaca and elsewhere; what i [[feel]] most is the [[fact]] of our
being so inferior to [[ulysses]] in [[strength]] that we cannot string his
bow. this will disgrace us in the [[eyes]] of those who are yet unborn."

"it shall not be so, eurymachus," said antinous, "and you [[know]] it
yourself. to-day is the feast of [[apollo]] throughout all the [[land]]; who
can string a bow on such a day as this? put it on one side- as for
the axes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come
to the house and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his
cups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of
the bow; we will tell melanthius to bring us in some goats to-morrow-
the [[best]] he has; we can then offer thigh bones to [[apollo]] the mighty
archer, and again make [[trial]] of the bow, so as to bring the contest
to an end." 

the rest approved his words, and thereon [[men]] servants poured water
over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls
with wine and water and handed it round after giving every [[man]] his
drink-offering. then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk
each as much as he [[desired]], [[ulysses]] craftily said: 

"suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that i may speak even as
i am minded. i appeal more especially to eurymachus, and to antinous
who has just spoken with so much [[reason]]. cease shooting for the present
and leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let [[heaven]] give
victory to whom it will. for the moment, however, give me the bow
that i may prove the [[power]] of my hands among you all, and see whether
i still have as much [[strength]] as i used to have, or whether travel
and neglect have made an end of it." 

this made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the
bow; antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, "wretched creature,
you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole [[body]]; you ought
to [[think]] yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your
betters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others
have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. no other
beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves;
the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all
those drink immoderately. it was wine that inflamed the centaur eurytion
when he was staying with peirithous among the lapithae. when the wine
had got into his head he went mad and did ill deeds about the house
of peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so
they rushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged
him through the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed,
and bore the burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. henceforth,
therefore, there was [[war]] between [[mankind]] and the centaurs, but he
brought it upon himself through his own drunkenness. in like manner
i can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you string the bow:
you will find no [[mercy]] from any one here, for we shall at once ship
you off to [[king]] echetus, who kills every one that comes near him:
you will never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting
into a quarrel with [[men]] younger than yourself." 

penelope then spoke to him. "antinous," said she, "it is not right
that you should ill-treat any guest of telemachus who comes to this
house. if the stranger should prove [[strong]] enough to string the mighty
bow of [[ulysses]], can you suppose that he would take me [[home]] with him
and make me his [[wife]]? even the [[man]] himself can have no such [[idea]] in
his [[mind]]: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would
be out of all [[reason]]." 

"queen penelope," answered eurymachus, "we do not suppose that this
man will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid
lest some of the baser sort, [[men]] or [[women]] among the achaeans, should
go gossiping about and say, 'these suitors are a feeble folk; they
are paying court to the [[wife]] of a brave [[man]] whose bow not one of them
was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house
strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.' this is what
will be said, and it will be a scandal against us." 

"eurymachus," penelope answered, "people who persist in eating up
the estate of a [[great]] chieftain and dishonouring his house must not
expect others to [[think]] well of them. why then should you [[mind]] if men
talk as you [[think]] they will? this stranger is [[strong]] and well-built,
he says moreover that he is of [[noble]] birth. give him the bow, and
let us see whether he can string it or no. i say- and it shall surely
be- that if [[apollo]] vouchsafes him the [[glory]] of stringing it, i will
give him a cloak and shirt of [[good]] wear, with a javelin to keep off
dogs and robbers, and a sharp [[sword]]. i will also give him sandals,
and will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go." 

then telemachus said, "mother, i am the only [[man]] either in ithaca
or in the islands that are over against elis who has the [[right]] to
let any one have the bow or to refuse it. no one shall [[force]] me one
way or the other, not even though i choose to make the stranger a
present of the bow outright, and let him take it away with him. go,
then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties [[duty]], your
loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. this bow is
a man's [[man]] matter, and mine above all others, for it is i who am master
here." 

she went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying
in her [[heart]]. then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,
she mourned her dear husband till minerva sent sweet sleep over her
eyelids. 

the swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to [[ulysses]],
but the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters,
and one of them said, "you idiot, where are you taking the bow to?
are you out of your wits? if [[apollo]] and the other gods will grant
our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little
place, and worry you to [[death]]." 

eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the
bow down then and there, but telemachus shouted out at him from the
other side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, "father eumaeus,
bring the bow on in spite of them, or [[young]] as i am i will pelt you
with stones back to the [[country]], for i am the [[better]] [[man]] of the two.
i [[wish]] i was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house
as i am than you, i would soon send some of them off sick and [[sorry]],
for they mean mischief." 

thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put
them in a [[better]] [[humour]] with telemachus; so eumaeus brought the bow
on and placed it in the hands of [[ulysses]]. when he had done this, he
called euryclea apart and said to her, "euryclea, telemachus says
you are to close the doors of the women's apartments. if they hear
any groaning or uproar as of [[men]] fighting about the house, they are
not to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at
their [[work]]." 

euryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women's apartments.

meanwhile philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of
the outer court. there was a ship's cable of byblus fibre lying in
the gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in
again, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on [[ulysses]],
who had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way
about, and proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating
into its two horns during his absence. then would one turn towards
his neighbour saying, "this is some tricky old bow-fancier; either
he has got one like it at [[home]], or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike
style does the old vagabond handle it." 

another said, "i [[hope]] he may be no more successful in other things
than he is likely to be in stringing this bow." 

but [[ulysses]], when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung
it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes
the twisted gut fast at both ends. then he took it in his [[right]] hand
to prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the
twittering of a swallow. the suitors were dismayed, and turned colour
as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, jove thundered loudly
as a sign, and the [[heart]] of [[ulysses]] rejoiced as he heard the omen
that the [[son]] of scheming saturn had sent him. 

he took an arrow that was lying upon the table- for those which the
achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver-
he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the
arrow and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. when he
had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes
of the axes from the first onwards till it had gone [[right]] through
them, and into the outer courtyard. then he said to telemachus:

"your guest has not disgraced you, telemachus. i did not miss what
i aimed at, and i was not long in stringing my bow. i am still [[strong]],
and not as the suitors twit me with being. now, however, it is time
for the achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight,
and then otherwise to disport themselves with [[song]] and dance which
are the crowning ornaments of a banquet." 

as he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and telemachus girded
on his [[sword]], grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father's
seat. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book xxii

then [[ulysses]] tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement
with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. he shed the arrows on
to the ground at his feet and said, "the mighty contest is at an end.
i will now see whether [[apollo]] will vouchsafe it to me to hit another
mark which no [[man]] has yet hit." 

on this he aimed a deadly arrow at antinous, who was about to take
up a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in
his hands. he had no [[thought]] of death- who amongst all the revellers
would [[think]] that one [[man]], however brave, would stand alone among so
many and kill him? the arrow struck antinous in the throat, and the
point went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup
dropped from his hand, while a thick stream of [[blood]] gushed from his
nostrils. he kicked the table from him and upset the things on it,
so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over
on to the ground. the suitors were in an uproar when they saw that
a [[man]] had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of them from
their seats and looked everywhere towards the walls, but there was
neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked [[ulysses]] very angrily. "stranger,"
said they, "you shall [[pay]] for shooting [[people]] in this way: om yi you
shall see no other contest; you are a doomed [[man]]; he whom you have
slain was the foremost [[youth]] in ithaca, and the vultures shall devour
you for having killed him." 

thus they spoke, for they [[thought]] that he had killed antinous by mistake,
and did not perceive that [[death]] was hanging over the head of every
one of them. but [[ulysses]] glared at them and said: 

"dogs, did you [[think]] that i should not come back from troy? you have
wasted my substance, have forced my [[women]] servants to [[lie]] with you,
and have wooed my [[wife]] while i was still living. you have feared neither
cod nor [[man]], and now you shall [[die]]." 

they turned pale with [[fear]] as he spoke, and every [[man]] looked round
about to see whither he might fly for safety, but eurymachus alone
spoke. 

"if you are [[ulysses]]," said he, "then what you have said is just. we
have done much [[wrong]] on your lands [[land]] and in your house. but antinous
who was the head and front of the offending lies [[lie]] low already. it was
all his doing. it was not that he wanted to [[marry]] penelope; he did
not so much [[care]] about that; what he wanted was something quite different,
and jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son
and to be [[chief]] [[man]] in ithaca. now, therefore, that he has met the
death which was his due, spare the lives [[life]] of your [[people]]. we will make
everything [[good]] among ourselves, and [[pay]] you in full for all that
we have eaten and drunk. each one of us shall [[pay]] you a fine worth
twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your
heart is softened. until we have done this no one can [[complain]] of
your being enraged against us." 

ulysses again glared at him and said, "though you should give me all
that you have in the [[world]] both now and all that you ever shall have,
i will not stay my hand till i have paid all of you in full. you must
fight, or fly for your lives [[life]]; and fly, not a [[man]] of you shall."

their hearts [[heart]] sank as they heard him, but eurymachus again spoke saying:

"my [[friends]], this [[man]] will give us no quarter. he will stand where
he is and shoot us down till he has killed every [[man]] among us. let
us then show [[fight]]; draw your swords [[sword]], and hold up the tables to shield
you from his arrows. let us have at him with a rush, to drive him
from the pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town,
and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting."

as he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides,
and with a loud cry sprang towards [[ulysses]], but [[ulysses]] instantly
shot an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed
itself in his liver. he dropped his [[sword]] and fell doubled up over
his table. the cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as
he smote the [[earth]] with his forehead in the agonies of [[death]], and
he kicked the stool with his feet until his [[eyes]] were closed in darkness.

then amphinomus drew his [[sword]] and made straight at [[ulysses]] to try
and get him away from the door; but telemachus was too quick for him,
and struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders
and went [[right]] through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground
and struck the [[earth]] with his forehead. then telemachus sprang away
from him, leaving his spear still in the [[body]], for he feared that
if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the achaeans might come up
and hack at him with his [[sword]], or knock him down, so he set off at
a run, and immediately was at his father's side. then he said:

"father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet
for your temples. i will arm myself as well, and will bring other
armour for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had [[better]] be armed."

"run and fetch them," answered [[ulysses]], "while my arrows hold out,
or when i am alone they may get me away from the door." 

telemachus did as his [[father]] said, and went off to the store room
where the armour was kept. he chose four shields, eight spears, and
four brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. he brought them with all
speed to his [[father]], and armed himself first, while the stockman and
the swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places near
ulysses. meanwhile [[ulysses]], as long as his arrows lasted, had been
shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another:
when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end
wall of the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick
about his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought
with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he
grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears. 

now there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of the pavement
there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed
by a well-made door. [[ulysses]] told philoetius to stand by this door
and guard it, for only one [[person]] could attack it at a [[time]]. but agelaus
shouted out, "cannot some one go up to the trap door and tell the
people what is going on? [[help]] would come at once, and we should soon
make an end of this [[man]] and his shooting." 

"this may not be, agelaus," answered melanthius, "the mouth of the
narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court.
one brave [[man]] could prevent any number from getting in. but i know
what i will do, i will bring you arms from the store room, for i am
sure it is there that [[ulysses]] and his [[son]] have put them."

on this the goatherd melanthius went by back passages to the store
room of [[ulysses]], house. there he chose twelve shields, with as many
helmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give
them to the suitors. ulysses' [[heart]] began to fail him when he saw
the suitors putting on their armour and brandishing their spears.
he saw the greatness of the danger, and said to telemachus, "some
one of the [[women]] inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may
be melanthius." 

telemachus answered, "the [[fault]], [[father]], is mine, and mine only; i
left the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out
than i have. go, eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one
of the [[women]] who is doing this, or whether, as i suspect, it is melanthius
the [[son]] of dolius." 

thus did they converse. meanwhile melanthius was again going to the
store room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said
to [[ulysses]] who was beside him, "ulysses, [[noble]] [[son]] of laertes, it
is that scoundrel melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to
the store room. say, shall i kill him, if i can get the [[better]] of
him, or shall i bring him here that you may take your own revenge
for all the many wrongs [[wrong]] that he has done in your house?"

ulysses answered, "telemachus and i will hold these suitors in check,
no matter what they do; go back both of you and bind melanthius' hands
and feet behind him. throw him into the store room and make the door
fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his [[body]], and string him
close up to the rafters from a high bearing-post, that he may linger
on in an agony." 

thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to
the store room, which they entered before melanthius saw them, for
he was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room,
so the two took their stand on either side of the door and waited.
by and by melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old
dry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by laertes when
he was [[young]], but which had been long since thrown aside, and the
straps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him
back by the hair, and threw him struggling to the ground. they bent
his hands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with
a painful bond as [[ulysses]] had told them; then they fastened a noose
about his [[body]] and strung him up from a high pillar till he was close
up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, o swineherd eumaeus,
saying, "melanthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as you
deserve. you will [[know]] very well when morning comes from the streams
of oceanus, and it is [[time]] for you to be driving in your goats for
the suitors to feast on." 

there, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on
their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take
their places by the side of [[ulysses]]; whereon the four [[men]] stood in
the cloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were
in the [[body]] of the court were still both brave and many. then jove's
daughter minerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form
of mentor. [[ulysses]] was glad when he saw her and said, "mentor, lend
me your [[help]], and forget not your old comrade, nor the many [[good]] turns
he has done you. besides, you are my age-mate." 

but all the [[time]] he [[felt]] sure it was minerva, and the suitors from
the other side raised an uproar when they saw her. agelaus was the
first to reproach her. "mentor," he cried, "do not let [[ulysses]] beguile
you into siding with him and fighting the suitors. this is what we
will do: when we have killed these [[people]], [[father]] and [[son]], we will
kill you too. you shall [[pay]] for it with your head, and when we have
killed you, we will take all you have, in doors or out, and bring
it into hotch-pot with ulysses' [[property]]; we will not let your sons
live in your house, nor your daughters [[daughter]], nor shall your widow continue
to [[live]] in the [[city]] of ithaca." 

this made minerva still more furious, so she scolded [[ulysses]] very
angrily. "ulysses," said she, "your [[strength]] and prowess are no longer
what they were when you fought for nine long years among the trojans
about the [[noble]] [[lady]] helen. you killed many a [[man]] in those days, and
it was through your stratagem that priam's [[city]] was taken. how comes
it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your
own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house? come
on, my [[good]] fellow, stand by my side and see how mentor, [[son]] of alcinous
shall [[fight]] your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him."

but she would not give him full [[victory]] as yet, for she wished still
further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave [[son]], so she
flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat
upon it in the form of a swallow. 

meanwhile agelaus [[son]] of damastor, eurynomus, amphimedon, demoptolemus,
pisander, and polybus [[son]] of polyctor bore the brunt of the fight
upon the suitors' side; of all those who were still fighting for their
lives they were by far the most valiant, for the others had already
fallen under the arrows of [[ulysses]]. agelaus shouted to them and said,
"my [[friends]], he will soon have to leave off, for mentor has gone away
after having done nothing for him but brag. they are standing at the
doors unsupported. do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw
your spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory
by killing him. when he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the
others." 

they threw their spears as he bade them, but minerva made them all
of no effect. one hit the door post; another went against the door;
the pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they
had avoided all the spears of the suitors [[ulysses]] said to his own
men, "my [[friends]], i should say we too had [[better]] let drive into the
middle of them, or they will [[crown]] all the harm they have done us
by us outright." 

they therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.
ulysses killed demoptolemus, telemachus euryades, eumaeus elatus,
while the stockman killed pisander. these all bit the dust, and as
the others drew back into a corner [[ulysses]] and his [[men]] rushed forward
and regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies [[body]] of the [[dead]].

the suitors now aimed a second [[time]], but again minerva made their
weapons for the most part without effect. one hit a bearing-post of
the cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft
of another struck the wall. still, amphimedon just took a piece of
the top skin from off telemachus's wrist, and ctesippus managed to
graze eumaeus's shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and
fell to the ground. then [[ulysses]] and his [[men]] let drive into the crowd
of suitors. [[ulysses]] hit eurydamas, telemachus amphimedon, and eumaeus
polybus. after this the stockman hit ctesippus in the breast, and
taunted him saying, "foul-mouthed [[son]] of polytherses, do not be so
foolish as to talk wickedly another [[time]], but let [[heaven]] direct your
speech, for the gods are far stronger than [[men]]. i make you a present
of this [[advice]] to repay you for the foot which you gave [[ulysses]] when
he was begging about in his own house." 

thus spoke the stockman, and [[ulysses]] struck the [[son]] of damastor with
a spear in close [[fight]], while telemachus hit leocritus [[son]] of evenor
in the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell
forward full on his face upon the ground. then minerva from her seat
on the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts [[heart]] of the suitors
quailed. they fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle
maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their
longest. as eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains
swoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground,
and kill them, for they cannot either [[fight]] or fly, and lookers on
enjoy the sport- even so did [[ulysses]] and his [[men]] fall upon the suitors
and smite them on every side. they made a horrible groaning as their
brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with their [[blood]].

leiodes then caught the knees of [[ulysses]] and said, "ulysses i beseech
you have [[mercy]] upon me and spare me. i never wronged any of the women
in your house either in word or deed, and i tried to stop the others.
i saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for
their folly. i was their sacrificing [[priest]]; if you kill me, i shall
die without having done anything to deserve it, and shall have got
no thanks for all the [[good]] that i did." 

ulysses looked sternly at him and answered, "if you were their sacrificing
priest, you must have prayed many a [[time]] that it might be long before
i got [[home]] again, and that you might [[marry]] my [[wife]] and have children
by her. therefore you shall [[die]]." 

with these words he picked up the [[sword]] that agelaus had dropped when
he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. then he
struck leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling
in the dust while he was yet speaking. 

the minstrel phemius [[son]] of terpes- he who had been forced by the
suitors to sing to them- now tried to save his [[life]]. he was standing
near towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. he did
not [[know]] whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar
of jove that was in the outer court, and on which both laertes and
ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to
go straight up to [[ulysses]] and embrace his knees, but in the end he
deemed it [[best]] to embrace ulysses' knees. so he laid his lyre on the
ground the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded seat;
then going up to [[ulysses]] he caught hold of his knees and said, "ulysses,
i beseech you have [[mercy]] on me and spare me. you will be [[sorry]] for
it afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both for gods and men
as i can. i make all my lays myself, and [[heaven]] visits me with every
kind of inspiration. i would sing to you as though you were a [[god]],
do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. your own son
telemachus will tell you that i did not want to frequent your house
and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many
and too [[strong]] for me, so they made me." 

telemachus heard him, and at once went up to his [[father]]. "hold!" he
cried, "the [[man]] is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will medon too,
who was always [[good]] to me when i was a boy, unless philoetius or eumaeus
has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you were
raging about the court." 

medon caught these words of telemachus, for he was crouching under
a seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly
flayed heifer's hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to telemachus,
and laid hold of his knees. 

"here i am, my dear sir," said he, "stay your hand therefore, and
tell your [[father]], or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors
for having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful
to yourself." 

ulysses smiled at him and answered, "fear not; telemachus has saved
your [[life]], that you may [[know]] in future, and tell other [[people]], how
greatly [[better]] [[good]] deeds [[prosper]] than [[evil]] ones. go, therefore, outside
the cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way of the slaughter-
you and the bard- while i finish my [[work]] here inside." 

the pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat
down by jove's [[great]] altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting
that they would be killed. then [[ulysses]] searched the whole court carefully
over, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living,
but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their [[blood]].
they were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea,
and thrown upon the beach to [[lie]] gasping for water till the heat of
the sun makes an end of them. even so were the suitors lying all huddled
up one against the other. 

then [[ulysses]] said to telemachus, "call nurse euryclea; i have something
to say to her." 

telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room. "make
haste," said he, "you old woman who have been set over all the other
women in the house. come outside; my [[father]] wishes [[wish]] to speak to you."

when euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women's room
and came out, following telemachus. she found [[ulysses]] among the corpses
bespattered with [[blood]] and filth like a lion that has just been devouring
an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so that
he is a fearful sight; even so was [[ulysses]] besmirched from head to
foot with gore. when she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of
blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw that a great
deed had been done; but [[ulysses]] checked her, "old woman," said he,
"rejoice in [[silence]]; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise
about it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over [[dead]] [[men]]. heaven's doom
and their own [[evil]] deeds have brought these [[men]] to destruction, for
they respected no [[man]] in the whole [[world]], neither [[rich]] nor [[poor]], who
came near them, and they have come to a [[bad]] end as a [[punishment]] for
their wickedness and folly. now, however, tell me which of the women
in the house have misconducted themselves, and who are [[innocent]]."

"i will tell you the [[truth]], my [[son]]," answered euryclea. "there are
fifty [[women]] in the house whom we [[teach]] to do things, such as carding
wool, and all kinds [[kind]] of household [[work]]. of these, twelve in all have
misbehaved, and have been wanting in [[respect]] to me, and also to penelope.
they showed no disrespect to telemachus, for he has only lately grown
and his [[mother]] never permitted him to give orders to the female servants;
but let me go upstairs and tell your [[wife]] all that has happened, for
some [[god]] has been sending her to sleep." 

"do not wake her yet," answered [[ulysses]], "but tell the [[women]] who have
misconducted themselves to come to me." 

euryclea left the cloister to tell the [[women]], and make them come to
ulysses; in the meantime he called telemachus, the stockman, and the
swineherd. "begin," said he, "to remove the [[dead]], and make the women
help you. then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables
and seats. when you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters,
take the [[women]] into the space between the domed room and the wall
of the outer court, and run them through with your swords [[sword]] till they
are quite [[dead]], and have forgotten all about [[love]] and the way in which
they used to [[lie]] in secret with the suitors." 

on this the [[women]] came down in a [[body]], weeping and wailing bitterly.
first they carried the [[dead]] bodies [[body]] out, and propped them up against
one another in the gatehouse. [[ulysses]] ordered them about and made
them do their [[work]] quickly, so they had to carry the bodies [[body]] out. when
they had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges
and water, while telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood
and dirt from the ground, and the [[women]] carried it all away and put
it out of doors. then when they had made the whole place quite clean
and orderly, they took the [[women]] out and hemmed them in the narrow
space between the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so
that they could not get away: and telemachus said to the other two,
"i shall not let these [[women]] [[die]] a clean [[death]], for they were insolent
to me and my [[mother]], and used to sleep with the suitors."

so saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of the bearing-posts
that supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around
the building, at a [[good]] height, lest any of the women's feet should
touch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that
has been set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their
nest, and a terrible [[fate]] awaits them, even so did the [[women]] have
to put their heads in nooses one after the other and [[die]] most miserably.
their feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.

as for melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner
court. there they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his
vitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they
cut off his hands and his feet. 

when they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went
back into the house, for all was now over; and [[ulysses]] said to the
dear old nurse euryclea, "bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution,
and fetch [[fire]] also that i may burn it, and purify the cloisters.
go, moreover, and tell penelope to come here with her attendants,
and also all the maid servants that are in the house." 

"all that you have said is true," answered euryclea, "but let me bring
you some clean clothes- a shirt and cloak. do not keep these rags
on your back any longer. it is not [[right]]." 

"first [[light]] me a [[fire]]," replied [[ulysses]]. 
she brought the [[fire]] and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and ulysses
thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts.
then she went inside to call the [[women]] and tell them what had happened;
whereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands,
and pressed round [[ulysses]] to embrace him, kissing his head and shoulders
and taking hold of his hands. it made him [[feel]] as if he should like
to weep, for he remembered every one of them.

book xxiii

euryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her
dear husband had come [[home]]. her aged knees became [[young]] again and
her feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent
over her head to speak to her. "wake up penelope, my dear child,"
she exclaimed, "and see with your own [[eyes]] something that you have
been wanting this long [[time]] [[past]]. [[ulysses]] has at [[last]] indeed come
home again, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble
in his house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his [[son]]."

"my [[good]] nurse," answered penelope, "you must be mad. the gods sometimes
send some very sensible [[people]] out of their minds [[mind]], and make foolish
people become sensible. this is what they must have been doing to
you; for you always used to be a reasonable [[person]]. why should you
thus mock me when i have trouble enough already- talking such nonsense,
and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of
my [[eyes]] and closed them? i have never slept so soundly from the day
my [[poor]] husband went to that [[city]] with the ill-omened name. go back
again into the women's room; if it had been any one else, who had
woke me up to bring me such absurd news i should have sent her away
with a severe scolding. as it is, your [[age]] shall [[protect]] you."

"my dear child," answered euryclea, "i am not mocking you. it is quite
true as i tell you that [[ulysses]] is come [[home]] again. he was the stranger
whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister. telemachus
knew all the [[time]] that he was come back, but kept his father's secret
that he might have his [[revenge]] on all these wicked [[people]].

then penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round euryclea,
and wept for joy. "but my dear nurse," said she, "explain this to
me; if he has really come [[home]] as you say, how did he manage to overcome
the wicked suitors [[single]] handed, seeing what a number of them there
always were?" 

"i was not there," answered euryclea, "and do not [[know]]; i only heard
them groaning while they were being killed. we sat crouching and huddled
up in a corner of the women's room with the doors closed, till your
son came to fetch me because his [[father]] sent him. then i found ulysses
standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all round
him, one on top of the other. you would have enjoyed it if you could
have seen him standing there all bespattered with [[blood]] and filth,
and looking just like a lion. but the corpses are now all piled up
in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and [[ulysses]] has lit a
great [[fire]] to purify the house with sulphur. he has sent me to call
you, so come with me that you may both be [[happy]] together after all;
for now at [[last]] the [[desire]] of your [[heart]] has been fulfilled; your
husband is come [[home]] to find both [[wife]] and [[son]] alive and well, and
to take his [[revenge]] in his own house on the suitors who behaved so
badly to him." 

"'my dear nurse," said penelope, "do not exult too confidently over
all this. you [[know]] how delighted every one would be to see ulysses
come home- more particularly myself, and the [[son]] who has been born
to both of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. it is some
god who is angry with the suitors for their [[great]] wickedness, and
has made an end of them; for they respected no [[man]] in the whole [[world]],
neither [[rich]] nor [[poor]], who came near them, who came near them, and
they have come to a [[bad]] end in consequence of their [[iniquity]]. ulysses
is [[dead]] far away from the achaean [[land]]; he will never return home
again." 

then nurse euryclea said, "my child, what are you talking about? but
you were all hard of [[belief]] and have made up your [[mind]] that your husband
is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own [[fire]] side
at this very moment. besides i can give you another proof; when i
was washing him i perceived the scar which the wild boar gave him,
and i wanted to tell you about it, but in his [[wisdom]] he would not
let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and i
will make this bargain with you- if i am deceiving you, you may have
me killed by the most cruel [[death]] you can [[think]] of." 

"my dear nurse," said penelope, "however [[wise]] you may be you can hardly
fathom the counsels of the gods. nevertheless, we will go in search
of my [[son]], that i may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man
who has killed them." 

on this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she
considered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband
and [[question]] him, or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace
him. when, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister,
she sat down opposite [[ulysses]] by the [[fire]], against the wall at right
angles [to that by which she had entered], while [[ulysses]] sat near
one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and waiting to
see what his [[wife]] would say to him when she saw him. for a long time
she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. at one moment she looked
him full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his
shabby clothes and failed to recognize him, till telemachus began
to reproach her and said: 

"mother- but you are so hard that i cannot call you by such a name-
why do you keep away from my [[father]] in this way? why do you not sit
by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions [[question]]? no
other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come
back to her after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through
so much; but your [[heart]] always was as hard as a stone." 

penelope answered, "my [[son]], i am so lost in astonishment that i can
find no words in which either to ask questions [[question]] or to [[answer]] them.
i cannot even look him straight in the face. still, if he really is
ulysses come back to his own [[home]] again, we shall get to understand
one another [[better]] by and by, for there are tokens with which we two
are alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others."

ulysses smiled at this, and said to telemachus, "let your [[mother]] put
me to any proof she likes; she will make up her [[mind]] about it presently.
she rejects me for the moment and believes [[belief]] me to be somebody else,
because i am covered with dirt and have such [[bad]] clothes on; let us,
however, consider what we had [[better]] do next. when one [[man]] has killed
another, even though he was not one who would leave many [[friends]] to
take up his quarrel, the [[man]] who has killed him must still say good
bye to his [[friends]] and fly the [[country]]; whereas we have been killing
the stay of a whole town, and all the picked [[youth]] of ithaca. i would
have you consider this matter." 

"look to it yourself, [[father]]," answered telemachus, "for they say
you are the wisest counsellor in the [[world]], and that there is no other
mortal [[man]] who can compare with you. we will [[follow]] you with right
good will, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength
holds out." 

"i will say what i [[think]] will be [[best]]," answered [[ulysses]]. "first wash
and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room
and dress; phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre,
so that if [[people]] outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some
one going along the street happens to notice it, they may [[think]] there
is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the [[death]] of the suitors
will get about in the town, before we can escape to the woods upon
my own [[land]]. once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven
vouchsafes us shall seem wisest." 

thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. first they washed
and put their shirts on, while the [[women]] got ready. then phemius took
his lyre and set them all longing for sweet [[song]] and stately dance.
the house re-echoed with the sound of [[men]] and [[women]] dancing, and the
people outside said, "i suppose the queen has been getting married
at [[last]]. she ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to
protect her husband's [[property]] until he comes [[home]]." 

this was what they said, but they did not [[know]] what it was that had
been happening. the upper servant eurynome washed and anointed ulysses
in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while minerva made
him look taller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow
thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth
blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a
skilful workman who has [[studied]] art [[arts]] of all kinds [[kind]] under vulcan or minerva-
and his [[work]] is full of beauty- enriches a piece of silver plate by
gilding it. he came from the bath looking like one of the immortals [[immortal]],
and sat down opposite his [[wife]] on the seat he had left. "my dear,"
said he, "heaven has endowed you with a [[heart]] more unyielding than
woman ever yet had. no other woman could bear to keep away from her
husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence,
and after having gone through so much. but come, nurse, get a bed
ready for me; i will sleep alone, for this woman has a [[heart]] as hard
as iron." 

"my dear," answered penelope, "i have no [[wish]] to set myself up, nor
to depreciate you; but i am not struck by your appearance, for i very
well [[remember]] what [[kind]] of a [[man]] you were when you set sail from ithaca.
nevertheless, euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that
he himself built. bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding
upon it with fleeces, [[good]] coverlets, and blankets." 

she said this to try him, but [[ulysses]] was very angry and said, "wife,
i am much displeased at what you have just been saying. who has been
taking my bed from the place in which i left it? he must have found
it a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some
god came and helped him to shift it. there is no [[man]] living, however
strong and in his prime, who could move it from its place, for it
is a marvellous curiosity which i made with my very own hands. there
was a [[young]] olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full
vigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post. i built my room round
this with [[strong]] walls of stone and a roof to cover them, and i made
the doors [[strong]] and well-fitting. then i cut off the top boughs of
the olive tree and left the stump standing. this i dressed roughly
from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter's tools well
and skilfully, straightening my [[work]] by drawing a line on the wood,
and making it into a bed-prop. i then bored a hole down the middle,
and made it the centre-post of my bed, at which i worked till i had
finished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this i stretched
a hide of crimson leather from one side of it to the other. so you
see i [[know]] all about it, and i [[desire]] to learn whether it is still
there, or whether any one has been removing it by cutting down the
olive tree at its roots." 

when she heard the sure proofs [[ulysses]] now gave her, she fairly broke
down. she flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck,
and kissed him. "do not be angry with me [[ulysses]]," she cried, "you,
who are the wisest of [[mankind]]. we have [[suffered]], both of us. heaven
has denied us the [[happiness]] of spending our [[youth]], and of growing
old, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that i did
not embrace you thus as soon as i saw you. i have been shuddering
all the [[time]] through [[fear]] that someone might come here and deceive
me with a lying story; for there are many very wicked [[people]] going
about. jove's [[daughter]] helen would never have yielded herself to a
man from a [[foreign]] [[country]], if she had known that the sons [[son]] of achaeans
would come after her and bring her back. [[heaven]] put it in her heart
to do [[wrong]], and she gave no [[thought]] to that [[sin]], which has been the
source of all our sorrows [[sorrow]]. now, however, that you have convinced me
by showing that you [[know]] all about our bed (which no [[human]] being has
ever seen but you and i and a [[single]] maid servant, the [[daughter]] of
actor, who was given me by my [[father]] on my [[marriage]], and who keeps
the doors of our room) hard of [[belief]] though i have been i can mistrust
no longer." 

then [[ulysses]] in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and
faithful [[wife]] to his bosom. as the sight of [[land]] is welcome to men
who are swimming towards the shore, when [[neptune]] has wrecked their
ship with the fury of his winds and waves- a few alone reach the [[land]],
and these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves
on firm ground and out of danger- even so was her husband welcome
to her as she looked upon him, and she could not tear her two fair
arms from about his neck. indeed they would have gone on indulging
their [[sorrow]] till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not minerva determined
otherwise, and held night back in the far west, while she would not
suffer dawn to leave oceanus, nor to yoke the two steeds lampus and
phaethon that bear her onward to break the day upon [[mankind]].

at [[last]], however, [[ulysses]] said, "wife, we have not yet reached the
end of our troubles. i have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo.
it is long and difficult, but i must go through with it, for thus
the shade of teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when i
went down into [[hades]] to ask about my return and that of my companions.
but now let us go to bed, that we may [[lie]] down and enjoy the blessed
boon of sleep." 

"you shall go to bed as soon as you please," replied penelope, "now
that the gods have sent you [[home]] to your own [[good]] house and to your
country. but as [[heaven]] has put it in your [[mind]] to speak of it, tell
me about the task that lies [[lie]] before you. i shall have to hear about
it later, so it is [[better]] that i should be told at once."

"my dear," answered [[ulysses]], "why should you press me to tell you?
still, i will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it.
i do not like it myself, for teiresias bade me travel far and wide,
carrying an oar, till i came to a [[country]] where the [[people]] have never
heard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food. they know
nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. he
gave me this [[certain]] token which i will not hide from you. he said
that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing
shovel that i had on my shoulder. on this, i was to fix my oar in
the ground and [[sacrifice]] a ram, a bull, and a boar to [[neptune]]; after
which i was to go [[home]] and offer hecatombs to all the gods in [[heaven]],
one after the other. as for myself, he said that [[death]] should come
to me from the sea, and that my [[life]] should ebb away very gently when
i was full of years and [[peace]] of [[mind]], and my [[people]] should bless
me. all this, he said, should surely come to pass." 

and penelope said, "if the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier
time in your old [[age]], you may [[hope]] then to have some respite from
misfortune." 

thus did they converse. meanwhile eurynome and the nurse took torches
and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid
them, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving
the bed chamber woman eurynome to show [[ulysses]] and penelope to bed
by torch [[light]]. when she had conducted them to their room she went
back, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.
telemachus, philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and
made the [[women]] leave off also. they then laid themselves down to sleep
in the cloisters. 

when [[ulysses]] and penelope had had their fill of [[love]] they fell talking
with one another. she told him how much she had had to bear in seeing
the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so
many sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many casks of
wine. [[ulysses]] in his turn told her what he had [[suffered]], and how much
trouble he had himself given to other [[people]]. he told her everything,
and she was so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till
he had ended his whole story. 

he began with his [[victory]] over the cicons, and how he thence reached
the fertile [[land]] of the lotus-eaters. he told her all about the cyclops
and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave
comrades; how he then went on to aeolus, who received him hospitably
and furthered him on his way, but even so he was not to reach [[home]],
for to his [[great]] [[grief]] a hurricane carried him out to sea again; how
he went on to the laestrygonian [[city]] telepylos, where the [[people]] destroyed
all his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only.
then he told of cunning circe and her craft, and how he sailed to
the chill house of [[hades]], to consult the ghost of the theban prophet
teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother
who bore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard
the wondrous singing of the sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks
and terrible charybdis and to scylla, whom no [[man]] had ever yet passed
in safety; how his [[men]] then ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how
jove therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, so that all
his [[men]] perished together, himself alone being left alive; how at
last he reached the ogygian island and the [[nymph]] calypso, who kept
him there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to [[marry]] her, in
which case she intended making him [[immortal]] so that he should never
grow old, but she could not persuade him to let her do so; and how
after much suffering he had found his way to the phaeacians, who had
treated him as though he had been a [[god]], and sent him back in a ship
to his own [[country]] after having given him gold, bronze, and raiment
in [[great]] abundance. this was the [[last]] thing about which he told her,
for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden of his
sorrows. 

then minerva bethought her of another matter. when she deemed that
ulysses had had both of his [[wife]] and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned
dawn rise out of oceanus that she might shed [[light]] upon [[mankind]]. on
this, [[ulysses]] rose from his comfortable bed and said to penelope,
"wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here,
in lamenting my absence, and i in being prevented from getting home
though i was longing all the [[time]] to do so. now, however, that we
have at [[last]] come together, take [[care]] of the [[property]] that is in the
house. as for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten,
i will take many myself by [[force]] from other [[people]], and will compel
the achaeans to make [[good]] the rest till they shall have filled all
my yards. i am now going to the wooded lands [[land]] out in the [[country]] to
see my [[father]] who has so long been [[grieved]] on my account, and to yourself
i will give these instructions, though you have little need of them.
at sunrise it will at once get abroad that i have been killing the
suitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there with your [[women]]. see
nobody and ask no questions [[question]]." 

as he spoke he girded on his armour. then he roused telemachus, philoetius,
and eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also. this they
did, and armed themselves. when they had done so, they opened the
gates and sallied forth, [[ulysses]] leading the way. it was now daylight,
but minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and [[led]] them quickly
out of the town.

book xxiv

then mercury of cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in
his hand he held the [[fair]] golden wand with which he seals men's eyes
in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the
ghosts and [[led]] them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind
him. as bats fly squealing in the hollow of some [[great]] cave, when
one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even
so did the ghosts whine and squeal as mercury the healer of sorrow
led them down into the dark abode of [[death]]. when they had passed the
waters of oceanus and the rock leucas, they came to the gates of the
sun and the [[land]] of dreams [[dream]], whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel
where dwell the souls [[soul]] and shadows of them that can [[labour]] no more.

here they found the ghost of achilles [[son]] of peleus, with those of
patroclus, antilochus, and ajax, who was the finest and handsomest
man of all the danaans after the [[son]] of peleus himself. 

they gathered round the ghost of the [[son]] of peleus, and the ghost
of [[agamemnon]] joined them, sorrowing bitterly. round him were gathered
also the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of
aeisthus; and the ghost of achilles spoke first. 

"son of atreus," it said, "we used to say that jove had loved you
better from first to [[last]] than any other hero, for you were captain
over many and brave [[men]], when we were all fighting together before
troy; yet the hand of [[death]], which no mortal can escape, was laid
upon you all too early. [[better]] for you had you fallen at troy in the
hey-day of your renown, for the achaeans would have built a mound
over your ashes, and your [[son]] would have been heir to your [[good]] name,
whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end."

"happy [[son]] of peleus," answered the ghost of [[agamemnon]], "for having
died at troy far from argos, while the bravest of the trojans and
the achaeans fell round you fighting for your [[body]]. there you lay
in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now
of your chivalry. we fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should
we ever have left off if jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us.
then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid
you on your bed and cleansed your [[fair]] skin with warm water and with
ointments. the danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about
you. your [[mother]], when she heard, came with her [[immortal]] nymphs [[nymph]] from
out of the sea, and the sound of a [[great]] wailing went forth over the
waters so that the achaeans quaked for [[fear]]. they would have fled
panic-stricken to their ships had not [[wise]] old nestor whose counsel
was ever truest checked them saying, 'hold, argives, fly not sons
of the achaeans, this is his [[mother]] coming from the sea with her immortal
nymphs to view the [[body]] of her [[son]].' 

"thus he spoke, and the achaeans feared no more. the daughters [[daughter]] of
the old [[man]] of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed
you in [[immortal]] raiment. the nine muses also came and lifted up their
sweet voices in lament- calling and answering one another; there was
not an argive but wept for [[pity]] of the dirge they chaunted. days and
nights seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals [[immortal]], but on
the eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep
with many an ox did we slay in [[sacrifice]] around you. you were burnt
in raiment of the gods, with [[rich]] resins and with honey, while heroes,
horse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were burning,
with the tramp as of a [[great]] multitude. but when the flames of heaven
had done their [[work]], we gathered your [[white]] bones at daybreak and
laid them in ointments and in pure wine. your [[mother]] brought us a
golden vase to hold them- gift of bacchus, and [[work]] of vulcan himself;
in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of patroclus who
had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those of antilochus,
who had been closer to you than any other of your comrades now that
patroclus was no more. 

"over these the host of the argives built a [[noble]] tomb, on a point
jutting out over the open hellespont, that it might be seen from far
out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born
hereafter. your [[mother]] begged prizes from the gods, and offered them
to be contended for by the noblest of the achaeans. you must have
been [[present]] at the [[funeral]] of many a hero, when the [[young]] [[men]] gird
themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the [[death]] of some
great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed thetis
offered in your [[honour]]; for the gods loved you well. thus even in
death your fame, achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives
evermore among all [[mankind]]. but as for me, what solace had i when
the days of my fighting were done? for jove willed my destruction
on my return, by the hands of aegisthus and those of my wicked [[wife]]."

thus did they converse, and presently mercury came up to them with
the ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by [[ulysses]]. the ghosts
of [[agamemnon]] and achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went
up to them at once. the ghost of [[agamemnon]] recognized amphimedon son
of melaneus, who lived in ithaca and had been his host, so it began
to talk to him. 

"amphimedon," it said, "what has happened to all you fine [[young]] men-
all of an [[age]] too- that you are come down here under the ground? one
could pick no finer [[body]] of [[men]] from any [[city]]. did [[neptune]] raise his
winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies
make an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or
sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of their wives [[wife]] and [[city]]?
answer my [[question]], for i have been your guest. do you not remember
how i came to your house with menelaus, to persuade [[ulysses]] to join
us with his ships against troy? it was a whole month ere we could
resume our [[voyage]], for we had hard [[work]] to persuade [[ulysses]] to come
with us." 

and the ghost of amphimedon answered, "agamemnon, [[son]] of atreus, king
of [[men]], i [[remember]] everything that you have said, and will tell you
fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.
ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his [[wife]], who did
not say point blank that she would not [[marry]], nor yet bring matters
to an end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this, then, was
the trick she played us. she set up a [[great]] tambour frame in her room
and began to [[work]] on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'sweethearts,'
said she, 'ulysses is indeed [[dead]], still, do not press me to marry
again immediately; wait- for i would not have my [[skill]] in needlework
perish unrecorded- till i have completed a pall for the hero laertes,
against the [[time]] when [[death]] shall take him. he is very [[rich]], and the
women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' this
is what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working
upon her [[great]] web all day long, but at night she would unpick the
stitches again by torchlight. she fooled us in this way for three
years without our finding it out, but as [[time]] wore on and she was
now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many days had been
accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us,
and we caught her in the act of undoing her [[work]], so she had to finish
it whether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had
made, after she had had it washed, its splendour was as that of the
sun or moon. 

"then some malicious [[god]] conveyed [[ulysses]] to the upland farm where
his swineherd lives [[life]]. thither presently came also his [[son]], returning
from a [[voyage]] to pylos, and the two came to the town when they had
hatched their plot for our destruction. telemachus came first, and
then after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came [[ulysses]], clad in
rags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar.
he came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older
ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. he endured
both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his
own house; but when the will of aegis-bearing jove inspired him, he
and telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting
the doors behind them. then he cunningly made his [[wife]] offer his bow
and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors;
and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string
the bow- nor nearly do so. when it was about to reach the hands of
ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him,
no matter what he might say, but telemachus insisted on his having
it. when he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent
his arrow through the iron. then he stood on the floor of the cloister
and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. first
he killed antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly
his deadly darts and they fell thick on one another. it was plain
that some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us
with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous
sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the ground
seethed with our [[blood]]. this, [[agamemnon]], is how we came by our end,
and our bodies [[body]] are lying still un-cared for in the house of [[ulysses]],
for our [[friends]] at [[home]] do not yet [[know]] what has happened, so that
they cannot lay us out and wash the black [[blood]] from our wounds, making
moan over us according to the offices due to the departed."

"happy [[ulysses]], [[son]] of laertes," replied the ghost of [[agamemnon]], "you
are indeed blessed in the possession of a [[wife]] endowed with such rare
excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded [[lord]] as
penelope the [[daughter]] of icarius. the fame, therefore, of her virtue
shall never [[die]], and the immortals [[immortal]] shall compose a [[song]] that shall
be welcome to all [[mankind]] in [[honour]] of the constancy of penelope.
how far otherwise was the wickedness of the [[daughter]] of tyndareus
who killed her lawful husband; her [[song]] shall be hateful among [[men]],
for she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the [[good]] ones."

thus did they converse in the house of [[hades]] deep down within the
bowels of the [[earth]]. meanwhile [[ulysses]] and the others passed out of
the town and soon reached the [[fair]] and well-tilled farm of laertes,
which he had reclaimed with infinite [[labour]]. here was his house, with
a lean-to running all round it, where the slaves [[slave]] who worked for him
slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old sicel
woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. when ulysses
got there, he said to his [[son]] and to the other two: 

"go to the house, and kill the [[best]] pig that you can find for dinner.
meanwhile i want to see whether my [[father]] will [[know]] me, or fail to
recognize me after so long an absence." 

he then took off his armour and gave it to eumaeus and philoetius,
who went straight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard
to make [[trial]] of his [[father]]. as he went down into the [[great]] orchard,
he did not see dolius, nor any of his sons [[son]] nor of the other bondsmen,
for they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard,
at the place where the old [[man]] had told them; he therefore found his
father alone, hoeing a vine. he had on a dirty old shirt, patched
and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to
save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he
had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone.
when [[ulysses]] saw him so worn, so old and full of [[sorrow]], he stood
still under a tall pear tree and began to weep. he doubted whether
to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having come [[home]],
or whether he should first [[question]] him and see what he would say.
in the end he deemed it [[best]] to be crafty with him, so in this mind
he went up to his [[father]], who was bending down and digging about a
plant. 

"i see, sir," said [[ulysses]], "that you are an excellent gardener- what
pains you take with it, to be sure. there is not a [[single]] plant, not
a fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace
of your attention. i trust, however, that you will not be offended
if i say that you take [[better]] [[care]] of your garden than of yourself.
you are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. it cannot be because
you are idle that your master takes such [[poor]] [[care]] of you, indeed
your face and figure have nothing of the [[slave]] about them, and proclaim
you of [[noble]] birth. i should have said that you were one of those
who should wash well, [[eat]] well, and [[lie]] soft at night as old [[men]] have
a [[right]] to do; but tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you,
and in whose garden are you working? tell me also about another matter.
is this place that i have come to really ithaca? i met a [[man]] just
now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience
to hear my story out when i was asking him about an old friend of
mine, whether he was still living, or was already [[dead]] and in the
house of [[hades]]. [[believe]] me when i tell you that this [[man]] came to my
house once when i was in my own [[country]] and never yet did any stranger
come to me whom i liked [[better]]. he said that his [[family]] came from
ithaca and that his [[father]] was laertes, [[son]] of arceisius. i received
him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance of my house,
and when he went away i gave him all customary presents [[present]]. i gave him
seven [[talents]] of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with flowers
chased upon it. i gave him twelve [[light]] cloaks, and as many pieces
of tapestry; i also gave him twelve cloaks of [[single]] fold, twelve
rugs, twelve [[fair]] mantles, and an [[equal]] number of shirts. to all this
i added four [[good]] looking [[women]] skilled in all useful [[arts]], and i
let him take his [[choice]]." 

his [[father]] shed tears and answered, "sir, you have indeed come to
the [[country]] that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of
wicked [[people]]. all this [[wealth]] of presents [[present]] has been given to no [[purpose]].
if you could have found your friend here alive in ithaca, he would
have entertained you hospitably and would have required your presents
amply when you left him- as would have been only [[right]] considering
what you have already given him. but tell me, and tell me true, how
many years is it since you entertained this guest- my unhappy [[son]],
as ever was? alas! he has perished far from his own [[country]]; the fishes
of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and
wild beasts of some continent. neither his [[mother]], nor i his [[father]],
who were his parents, could throw our arms about him and wrap him
in his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly dowered [[wife]] penelope
bewail her husband as was [[natural]] upon his [[death]] bed, and close his
eyes according to the offices due to the departed. but now, tell me
truly for i want to [[know]]. who and whence are you- tell me of your
town and parents? where is the ship lying that has brought you and
your [[men]] to ithaca? or were you a passenger on some other man's [[man]] ship,
and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left you?"

"i will tell you everything," answered [[ulysses]], "quite truly. i come
from alybas, where i have a fine house. i am [[son]] of [[king]] apheidas,
who is the [[son]] of polypemon. my own name is eperitus; [[heaven]] drove
me off my course as i was leaving sicania, and i have been carried
here against my will. as for my ship it is lying over yonder, off
the open [[country]] outside the town, and this is the fifth year since
ulysses left my [[country]]. [[poor]] fellow, yet the omens were [[good]] for
him when he left me. the birds all flew on our [[right]] hands, and both
he and i rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope
that we should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents [[present]]."

a dark cloud of [[sorrow]] fell upon laertes as he listened. he filled
both hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his
grey head, groaning heavily as he did so. the [[heart]] of [[ulysses]] was
touched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his [[father]]; then
he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying,
"i am he, [[father]], about whom you are asking- i have returned after
having been away for twenty years. but cease your sighing and lamentation-
we have no [[time]] to lose, for i should tell you that i have been killing
the suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes."

"if you really are my [[son]] [[ulysses]]," replied laertes, "and have come
back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity
as shall convince me." 

"first observe this scar," answered [[ulysses]], "which i got from a boar's
tusk when i was hunting on mount parnassus. you and my [[mother]] had
sent me to autolycus, my mother's [[father]], to receive the presents
which when he was over here he had promised to give me. furthermore
i will point out to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me,
and i [[asked]] you all about them as i followed you round the garden.
we went over them all, and you told me their names and what they all
were. you gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty
fig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there
was corn planted between each row, and they yield grapes of every
kind when the heat of [[heaven]] has been laid heavy upon them."

laertes' [[strength]] failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which
his [[son]] had given him. he threw his arms about him, and [[ulysses]] had
to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon
as he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, "o
father jove, then you gods are still in [[olympus]] after all, if the
suitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly. nevertheless,
i am much afraid that i shall have all the townspeople of ithaca up
here directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout
the cities [[city]] of the cephallenians." 

ulysses answered, "take [[heart]] and do not trouble yourself about that,
but let us go into the house hard by your garden. i have already told
telemachus, philoetius, and eumaeus to go on there and get dinner
ready as soon as possible." 

thus conversing the two made their way towards the house. when they
got there they found telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd
cutting up meat and mixing wine with water. then the old sicel woman
took laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with [[oil]]. she
put him on a [[good]] cloak, and minerva came up to him and gave him a
more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter than before.
when he came back his [[son]] was surprised to see him looking so like
an [[immortal]], and said to him, "my dear [[father]], some one of the gods
has been making you much taller and better-looking." 

laertes answered, "would, by [[father]] jove, minerva, and [[apollo]], that
i were the [[man]] i was when i ruled among the cephallenians, and took
nericum, that [[strong]] fortress on the foreland. if i were still what
i then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on,
i should have been able to stand by you and [[help]] you against the suitors.
i should have killed a [[great]] many of them, and you would have rejoiced
to see it." 

thus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their
work and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his
proper place on the benches and seats. then they began eating; by
and by old dolius and his sons [[son]] left their [[work]] and came up, for their
mother, the sicel woman who looked after laertes now that he was growing
old, had been to fetch them. when they saw [[ulysses]] and were certain
it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but [[ulysses]] scolded
them good-naturedly and said, "sit down to your dinner, old [[man]], and
never [[mind]] about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for
some [[time]] and have been waiting for you." 

then dolius put out both his hands and went up to [[ulysses]]. "sir,"
said he, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, "we
have long been wishing you [[home]]: and now [[heaven]] has restored you to
us after we had given up hoping. all hail, therefore, and may the
gods [[prosper]] you. but tell me, does penelope already [[know]] of your
return, or shall we send some one to tell her?" 

"old [[man]]," answered [[ulysses]], "she knows [[know]] already, so you need not trouble
about that." on this he took his seat, and the sons [[son]] of dolius gathered
round [[ulysses]] to give him greeting and embrace him one after the other;
then they took their seats in due order near dolius their [[father]].

while they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, rumour went
round the town, and noised abroad the terrible [[fate]] that had befallen
the suitors; as soon, therefore, as the [[people]] heard of it they gathered
from every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of [[ulysses]].
they took the [[dead]] away, buried every [[man]] his own, and put the bodies
of those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for
the fishermen to take each of them to his own place. they then met
angrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got together
eupeithes rose to speak. he was overwhelmed with [[grief]] for the death
of his [[son]] antinous, who had been the first [[man]] killed by [[ulysses]],
so he said, weeping bitterly, "my friend, this [[man]] has done the achaeans
great [[wrong]]. he took many of our [[best]] [[men]] away with him in his fleet,
and he has lost both ships and [[men]]; now, moreover, on his return he
has been killing all the foremost [[men]] among the cephallenians. let
us be up and doing before he can get away to pylos or to elis where
the epeans [[rule]], or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards.
it will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder
of our sons [[son]] and brothers [[brother]]. for my own part i should have no mote pleasure
in [[life]], but had rather [[die]] at once. let us be up, then, and after
them, before they can cross over to the mainland." 

he wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. but medon and the bard
phemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of [[ulysses]].
every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle
of the assembly, and medon said, "hear me, [[men]] of ithaca. ulysses
did not do these things against the will of [[heaven]]. i myself saw an
immortal [[god]] take the form of mentor and stand beside him. this god
appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously
about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick
on one another." 

on this pale [[fear]] laid hold of them, and old halitherses, [[son]] of mastor,
rose to speak, for he was the only [[man]] among them who knew both past
and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,

"men of ithaca, it is all your own [[fault]] that things have turned out
as they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to mentor, when
we bade you check the folly of your sons [[son]] who were doing much wrong
in the wantonness of their hearts- wasting the substance and dishonouring
the [[wife]] of a chieftain who they [[thought]] would not return. now, however,
let it be as i say, and do as i tell you. do not go out against [[ulysses]],
or you may find that you have been drawing down [[evil]] on your own heads."

this was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and
at once left the assembly. but the rest stayed where they were, for
the [[speech]] of halitherses displeased them, and they sided with eupeithes;
they therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed
themselves, they met together in front of the [[city]], and eupeithes
led them on in their folly. he [[thought]] he was going to avenge the
murder of his [[son]], whereas in [[truth]] he was never to return, but was
himself to perish in his attempt. 

then minerva said to jove, "father, [[son]] of saturn, [[king]] of kings [[king]],
answer me this question- what do you propose to do? will you set them
fighting still further, or will you make [[peace]] between them?"

and jove answered, "my child, why should you ask me? was it not by
your own arrangement that [[ulysses]] came [[home]] and took his [[revenge]] upon
the suitors? do whatever you like, but i will tell you what i think
will be most reasonable arrangement. now that [[ulysses]] is revenged,
let them swear to a solemn covenant, in [[virtue]] of which he shall continue
to [[rule]], while we cause the others to [[forgive]] and forget the massacre
of their sons [[son]] and brothers [[brother]]. let them then all become [[friends]] as heretofore,
and let [[peace]] and plenty reign." 

this was what minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she
darted from off the topmost summits of [[olympus]]. 

now when laertes and the others had done dinner, [[ulysses]] began by
saying, "some of you go out and see if they are not getting close
up to us." so one of dolius's sons [[son]] went as he was bid. standing on
the threshold he could see them all quite near, and said to [[ulysses]],
"here they are, let us put on our armour at once." 

they put on their armour as fast as they could- that is to say [[ulysses]],
his three [[men]], and the six sons [[son]] of dolius. laertes also and dolius
did the same- warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. when
they had all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied
forth, [[ulysses]] leading the way. 

then jove's [[daughter]] minerva came up to them, having assumed the form
and voice of mentor. [[ulysses]] was glad when he saw her, and said to
his [[son]] telemachus, "telemachus, now that are about to [[fight]] in an
engagement, which will show every man's [[man]] mettle, be sure not to disgrace
your [[ancestors]], who were eminent for their [[strength]] and [[courage]] all
the [[world]] over." 

"you say truly, my dear [[father]]," answered telemachus, "and you shall
see, if you will, that i am in no [[mind]] to disgrace your [[family]]."

laertes was delighted when he heard this. "good heavens [[heaven]], he exclaimed,
"what a day i am enjoying: i do indeed rejoice at it. my [[son]] and grandson
are vying with one another in the matter of valour." 

on this minerva came close up to him and said, "son of arceisius-
best friend i have in the world- [[pray]] to the blue-eyed damsel, and
to jove her [[father]]; then poise your spear and hurl it." 

as she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed
to her he poised his spear and hurled it. he hit eupeithes' helmet,
and the spear went [[right]] through it, for the helmet stayed it not,
and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
meantime [[ulysses]] and his [[son]] fell the front line of the foe and smote
them with their swords [[sword]] and spears; indeed, they would have killed
every one of them, and prevented them from ever getting [[home]] again,
only minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. "men
of ithaca," she cried, cease this dreadful [[war]], and settle the matter
at once without further bloodshed." 

on this pale [[fear]] seized every one; they were so frightened that their
arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound
of the goddess's voice, and they fled back to the [[city]] for their lives [[life]].
but [[ulysses]] gave a [[great]] cry, and gathering himself together swooped
down like a soaring eagle. then the [[son]] of saturn sent a thunderbolt
of [[fire]] that fell just in front of minerva, so she said to [[ulysses]],
"ulysses, [[noble]] [[son]] of laertes, stop this warful strife, or jove will
be angry with you." 

thus spoke minerva, and [[ulysses]] obeyed her gladly. then minerva assumed
the form and voice of mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace
between the two contending parties.
