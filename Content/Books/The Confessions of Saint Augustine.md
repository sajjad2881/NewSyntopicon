great art [[arts]] thou, o [[lord]], and greatly to be praised; [[great]] is thy [[power]],
and thy [[wisdom]] infinite. and thee would [[man]] [[praise]]; [[man]], but a particle
of thy creation; [[man]], that bears about him his [[mortality]], the witness of
his [[sin]], the witness that thou resistest the proud: yet would [[man]] praise
thee; he, but a particle of thy creation. thou awakest us to delight in
thy [[praise]]; for thou madest us for thyself, and our [[heart]] is restless,
until it repose in thee. grant me, [[lord]], to [[know]] and [[understand]] which is
first, to call on thee or to [[praise]] thee? and, again, to [[know]] thee or
to call on thee? for who can call on thee, not knowing thee? for he that
knoweth thee not, may call on thee as other than thou art [[arts]]. or, is it
rather, that we call on thee that we may [[know]] thee? but how shall they
call on him in whom they have not believed? or how shall they believe
without a preacher? and they that seek the [[lord]] shall [[praise]] him: for
they that seek shall find him, and they that find shall [[praise]] him.
i will seek thee, [[lord]], by calling on thee; and will call on thee,
believing in thee; for to us hast thou been preached. my [[faith]], [[lord]],
shall call on thee, which thou hast given me, wherewith thou hast
inspired me, through the incarnation of thy [[son]], through the ministry of
the preacher.

and how shall i call upon my [[god]], my [[god]] and [[lord]], since, when i call
for him, i shall be calling him to myself? and what room is there within
me, whither my [[god]] can come into me? whither can [[god]] come into me, god
who made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]? is there, indeed, o [[lord]] my [[god]], aught in me
that can contain thee? do then [[heaven]] and [[earth]], which thou hast made,
and wherein thou hast made me, contain thee? or, because nothing which
exists could [[exist]] without thee, doth therefore whatever exists contain
thee? since, then, i too [[exist]], why do i seek that thou shouldest enter
into me, who were not, wert thou not in me? why? because i am not gone
down in hell, and yet thou art [[arts]] there also. for if i go down into hell,
thou art [[arts]] there. i could not be then, o my [[god]], could not be at all,
wert thou not in me; or, rather, unless i were in thee, of whom are all
things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things? even so, [[lord]],
even so. whither do i call thee, since i am in thee? or whence canst
thou enter into me? for whither can i go beyond [[heaven]] and [[earth]], that
thence my [[god]] should come into me, who hath said, i fill the [[heaven]] and
the [[earth]].

do the [[heaven]] and [[earth]] then contain thee, since thou fillest them? or
dost thou fill them and yet overflow, since they do not contain thee?
and whither, when the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]] are filled, pourest thou
forth the remainder of thyself? or hast thou no need that aught contain
thee, who containest all things, since what thou fillest thou fillest
by containing it? for the vessels which thou fillest uphold thee not,
since, though they were broken, thou wert not poured out. and when thou
art poured out on us, thou art [[arts]] not cast down, but thou upliftest us;
thou art [[arts]] not dissipated, but thou gatherest us. but thou who fillest
all things, fillest thou them with thy whole [[self]]? or, since all things
cannot contain thee wholly, do they contain part of thee? and all at
once the same part? or each its own part, the greater more, the smaller
less? and is, then one part of thee greater, another less? or, art [[arts]] thou
wholly every where, while nothing contains thee wholly?

what art [[arts]] thou then, my [[god]]? what, but the [[lord]] [[god]]? for who is lord
but the [[lord]]? or who is [[god]] save our [[god]]? most highest, most [[good]], most
potent, most omnipotent; most merciful, yet most just; most hidden,
yet most [[present]]; most beautiful, yet most [[strong]], stable, yet
incomprehensible; unchangeable, yet all-changing; never new, never old;
all-renewing, and bringing [[age]] upon the proud, and they [[know]] it not;
ever working, ever at rest; still gathering, yet nothing lacking;
supporting, filling, and overspreading; creating, nourishing, and
maturing; seeking, yet having all things. thou lovest, without passion;
art [[jealous]], without [[anxiety]]; repentest, yet grievest not; art [[arts]] angry,
yet serene; changest thy works [[work]], thy [[purpose]] unchanged; receivest again
what thou findest, yet didst never lose; never in need, yet rejoicing
in gains; never covetous, yet exacting usury. thou receivest over and
above, that thou mayest owe; and who hath aught that is not thine? thou
payest debts, owing nothing; remittest debts, losing nothing. and what
had i now said, my [[god]], my [[life]], my holy joy? or what saith any [[man]] when
he speaks of thee? yet woe to him that speaketh not, since mute are even
the most eloquent.

oh! that i might repose on thee! oh! that thou wouldest enter into my
heart, and inebriate it, that i may forget my ills, and embrace thee,
my sole good! what art [[arts]] thou to me? in thy [[pity]], [[teach]] me to utter it.
or what am i to thee that thou demandest my [[love]], and, if i give it not,
art wroth with me, and threatenest me with grievous woes? is it then a
slight woe to [[love]] thee not? oh! for thy mercies' sake, tell me, o lord
my [[god]], what thou art [[arts]] unto me. say unto my [[soul]], i am thy salvation. so
speak, that i may hear. behold, [[lord]], my [[heart]] is before thee; open thou
the ears thereof, and say unto my [[soul]], i am thy salvation. after this
voice let me haste, and take hold on thee. hide not thy face from me.
let me die--lest i die--only let me see thy face.

narrow is the mansion of my [[soul]]; enlarge thou it, that thou mayest
enter in. it is ruinous; repair thou it. it has that within which must
offend thine [[eyes]]; i confess and [[know]] it. but who shall cleanse it? or
to whom should i cry, save thee? [[lord]], cleanse me from my secret faults [[fault]],
and spare thy servant from the [[power]] of the [[enemy]]. i [[believe]], and
therefore do i speak. [[lord]], thou knowest. have i not confessed against
myself my transgressions unto thee, and thou, my [[god]], hast forgiven the
iniquity of my [[heart]]? i contend not in [[judgment]] with thee, who art [[arts]] the
truth; i [[fear]] to [[deceive]] myself; lest mine [[iniquity]] [[lie]] unto itself.
therefore i contend not in [[judgment]] with thee; for if thou, [[lord]],
shouldest mark iniquities, o [[lord]], who shall abide it?

yet suffer me to speak unto thy [[mercy]], me, dust and ashes. yet suffer me
to speak, since i speak to thy [[mercy]], and not to scornful [[man]]. thou too,
perhaps, despisest me, yet wilt thou return and have compassion upon me.
for what would i say, o [[lord]] my [[god]], but that i [[know]] not whence i
came into this dying [[life]] (shall i call it?) or living [[death]]. then
immediately did the comforts of thy compassion take me up, as i heard
(for i [[remember]] it not) from the parents of my flesh, out of whose
substance thou didst sometime [[fashion]] me. thus there received me the
comforts of woman's milk. for neither my [[mother]] nor my nurses stored
their own breasts for me; but thou didst bestow the food of my infancy
through them, according to thine ordinance, whereby thou distributest
thy riches [[rich]] through the hidden springs of all things. thou also gavest me
to [[desire]] no more than thou gavest; and to my nurses willingly to give
me what thou gavest them. for they, with a heaven-taught affection,
willingly gave me what they abounded with from thee. for this my good
from them, was [[good]] for them. nor, indeed, from them was it, but through
them; for from thee, o [[god]], are all [[good]] things, and from my [[god]] is all
my health. this i since learned, thou, through these thy gifts, within
me and without, proclaiming thyself unto me. for then i knew but to
suck; to repose in what pleased, and cry at what offended my flesh;
nothing more.

afterwards i began to smile; first in sleep, then waking: for so it
was told me of myself, and i believed it; for we see the like in other
infants, though of myself i [[remember]] it not. thus, little by little, i
became conscious where i was; and to have a [[wish]] to express my wishes
to those who could content them, and i could not; for the wishes [[wish]] were
within me, and they without; nor could they by any sense of theirs enter
within my spirit. so i flung about at random limbs and voice, making
the few signs i could, and such as i could, like, though in [[truth]] very
little like, what i wished. and when i was not presently obeyed (my
wishes being hurtful or unintelligible), then i was indignant with my
elders for not submitting to me, with those owing me no service, for
not serving me; and avenged myself on them by tears. such have i learnt
infants to be from observing them; and that i was myself such, they, all
unconscious, have shown me [[better]] than my nurses who knew it.

and, lo! my infancy died long since, and i [[live]]. but thou, [[lord]], who for
ever livest, and in whom nothing dies: for before the foundation of the
worlds, and before all that can be called "before," thou art [[arts]], and art
god and [[lord]] of all which thou hast created: in thee abide, fixed
for ever, the first causes of all things unabiding; and of all things
changeable, the springs abide in thee unchangeable: and in thee [[live]] the
eternal reasons [[reason]] of all things unreasoning and temporal. say, [[lord]], to
me, thy suppliant; say, all-pitying, to me, thy pitiable one; say, did
my infancy succeed another [[age]] of mine that died before it? was it
that which i spent within my mother's womb? for of that i have heard
somewhat, and have myself seen [[women]] with child? and what before that
life again, o [[god]] my joy, was i any where or any [[body]]? for this have i
none to tell me, neither [[father]] nor [[mother]], nor [[experience]] of others,
nor mine own memory. dost thou mock me for asking this, and bid me
praise thee and acknowledge thee, for that i do [[know]]?

i acknowledge thee, [[lord]] of [[heaven]] and [[earth]], and [[praise]] thee for my
first rudiments of being, and my infancy, whereof i [[remember]] nothing;
for thou hast appointed that [[man]] should from others guess much as to
himself; and [[believe]] much on the [[strength]] of [[weak]] females. even then i
had being and [[life]], and (at my infancy's close) i could seek for signs
whereby to make known to others my sensations. whence could such a being
be, save from thee, [[lord]]? shall any be his own artificer? or can there
elsewhere be derived any vein, which may stream essence and [[life]] into
us, save from thee, o [[lord]], in whom essence and [[life]] are one? for thou
thyself art [[arts]] supremely essence and [[life]]. for thou art [[arts]] most high, and art
not changed, neither in thee doth to-day come to a close; yet in thee
doth it come to a close; because all such things also are in thee. for
they had no way to pass away, unless thou upheldest them. and since
thy years fail not, thy years are one to-day. how many of ours and
our fathers' years have flowed away through thy "to-day," and from it
received the measure and the mould of such being as they had; and still
others shall flow away, and so receive the mould of their [[degree]] of
being. but thou art [[arts]] still the same, and all things of tomorrow, and all
beyond, and all of yesterday, and all behind it, thou hast done to-day.
what is it to me, though any comprehend not this? let him also rejoice
and say, what thing is this? let him rejoice even thus! and be content
rather by not discovering to discover thee, than by discovering not to
discover thee.

hear, o [[god]]. alas, for man's [[man]] sin! so saith [[man]], and thou pitiest him;
for thou madest him, but [[sin]] in him thou madest not. who remindeth me of
the sins [[sin]] of my infancy? for in thy sight none is pure from [[sin]], not even
the infant whose [[life]] is but a day upon the [[earth]]. who remindeth me?
doth not each little infant, in whom i see what of myself i remember
not? what then was my [[sin]]? was it that i hung upon the breast and cried?
for should i now so do for food suitable to my [[age]], justly should i be
laughed at and reproved. what i then did was worthy reproof; but since
i could not [[understand]] reproof, custom and [[reason]] forbade me to be
reproved. for those habits, when grown, we root out and cast away. now
no [[man]], though he prunes, wittingly casts away what is [[good]]. or was
it then [[good]], even for a while, to cry for what, if given, would hurt?
bitterly to resent, that persons [[person]] [[free]], and its own elders, yea, the very
authors of its birth, served it not? that many besides, wiser than it,
obeyed not the nod of its [[good]] [[pleasure]]? to do its [[best]] to strike and
hurt, because commands were not obeyed, which had been obeyed to its
hurt? the weakness then of infant limbs, not its will, is its innocence.
myself have seen and known even a baby envious; it could not speak, yet
it turned pale and looked bitterly on its foster-brother. who knows [[know]] not
this? mothers [[mother]] and nurses tell you that they allay these things by i know
not what remedies. is that too innocence, when the fountain of milk
is flowing in [[rich]] abundance, not to endure one to share it, though
in extremest need, and whose very [[life]] as yet depends thereon? we bear
gently with all this, not as being no or slight evils [[evil]], but because they
will disappear as years increase; for, though tolerated now, the very
same tempers are utterly intolerable when found in riper years.

thou, then, o [[lord]] my [[god]], who gavest [[life]] to this my infancy,
furnishing thus with senses (as we see) the frame thou gavest,
compacting its limbs, ornamenting its proportions, and, for its general
good and safety, implanting in it all vital functions, thou commandest
me to [[praise]] thee in these things, to confess unto thee, and sing unto
thy name, thou most highest. for thou art [[arts]] [[god]], almighty and [[good]], even
hadst thou done nought but only this, which none could do but thou:
whose unity is the mould of all things; who out of thy own fairness
makest all things [[fair]]; and orderest all things by thy [[law]]. this age
then, [[lord]], whereof i have no remembrance, which i take on others' word,
and guess from other infants that i have passed, true though the guess
be, i am yet loth to count in this [[life]] of mine which i [[live]] in this
world. for no less than that which i spent in my mother's womb, is it
hid from me in the shadows of forgetfulness. but if i was shapen in
iniquity, and in [[sin]] did my [[mother]] conceive me, where, i beseech thee, o
my [[god]], where, [[lord]], or when, was i thy servant guiltless? but, lo! that
period i pass by; and what have i now to do with that, of which i can
recall no vestige?

passing hence from infancy, i came to boyhood, or rather it came to me,
displacing infancy. nor did that depart,--(for whither went it?)--and
yet it was no more. for i was no longer a speechless infant, but a
speaking boy. this i [[remember]]; and have since observed how i learned to
speak. it was not that my elders taught me words (as, soon after, other
learning) in any set method; but i, longing by cries and broken accents
and various motions of my limbs to express my thoughts [[thought]], that so i might
have my will, and yet unable to express all i willed, or to whom i
willed, did myself, by the understanding which thou, my [[god]], gavest me,
practise the sounds in my memory. when they named any thing, and as they
spoke turned towards it, i saw and remembered that they called what they
would point out by the name they uttered. and that they meant this
thing and no other was plain from the motion of their [[body]], the natural
language, as it were, of all nations, expressed by the countenance,
glances of the eye, gestures of the limbs, and tones of the voice,
indicating the affections of the [[mind]], as it pursues, possesses,
rejects, or shuns. and thus by constantly hearing words, as they
occurred in various sentences, i collected gradually for what they
stood; and having broken in my mouth to these signs, i thereby gave
utterance to my will. thus i exchanged with those about me these current
signs of our wills, and so launched deeper into the stormy intercourse
of [[human]] [[life]], yet depending on parental [[authority]] and the beck of
elders.

o [[god]] my [[god]], what miseries and mockeries did i now [[experience]], when
obedience to my teachers was proposed to me, as proper in a boy, in
order that in this [[world]] i might [[prosper]], and excel in tongue-science,
which should serve to the "praise of [[men]]," and to deceitful riches [[rich]]. next
i was put to school to get learning, in which i (poor wretch) knew not
what use there was; and yet, if idle in learning, i was beaten. for this
was judged [[right]] by our forefathers; and many, passing the same course
before us, framed for us weary paths, through which we were fain to
pass; multiplying toil and [[grief]] upon the sons [[son]] of adam. but, [[lord]], we
found that [[men]] called upon thee, and we learnt from them to [[think]] of
thee (according to our powers) as of some [[great]] one, who, though hidden
from our senses, couldest hear and [[help]] us. for so i began, as a boy, to
pray to thee, my aid and refuge; and broke the fetters of my tongue to
call on thee, praying thee, though small, yet with no small earnestness,
that i might not be beaten at school. and when thou heardest me not (not
thereby giving me over to folly), my elders, yea my very parents, who
yet wished me no ill, mocked my stripes, my then [[great]] and grievous ill.

is there, [[lord]], any of [[soul]] so [[great]], and cleaving to thee with so
intense affection (for a sort of stupidity will in a way do it); but
is there any one who, from cleaving devoutly to thee, is endued with so
great a spirit, that he can [[think]] as lightly of the racks and hooks and
other torments (against which, throughout all lands [[land]], [[men]] call on thee
with extreme dread), mocking at those by whom they are feared most
bitterly, as our parents mocked the torments which we [[suffered]] in
boyhood from our masters? for we feared not our torments less; nor
prayed we less to thee to escape them. and yet we sinned, in writing or
reading or studying less than was exacted of us. for we wanted not, o
lord, memory or capacity, whereof thy will gave enough for our [[age]]; but
our sole delight was play; and for this we were punished by those who
yet themselves were doing the like. but elder folks' idleness is called
"business"; that of boys, being really the same, is punished by those
elders; and none commiserates either boys or [[men]]. for will any of sound
discretion approve of my being beaten as a boy, because, by playing a
ball, i made less [[progress]] in studies which i was to learn, only that,
as a [[man]], i might play more unbeseemingly? and what else did he who beat
me? who, if worsted in some trifling discussion with his fellow-tutor,
was more embittered and [[jealous]] than i when beaten at ball by a
play-fellow?

and yet, i sinned herein, o [[lord]] [[god]], the creator and disposer of all
things in [[nature]], of [[sin]] the disposer only, o [[lord]] my [[god]], i sinned in
transgressing the commands of my parents and those of my masters. for
what they, with whatever motive, would have me learn, i might afterwards
have put to [[good]] use. for i disobeyed, not from a [[better]] [[choice]], but
from [[love]] of play, loving the [[pride]] of [[victory]] in my contests, and to
have my ears tickled with lying fables, that they might itch the more;
the same curiosity flashing from my [[eyes]] more and more, for the shows
and games of my elders. yet those who give these shows are in such
esteem, that almost all [[wish]] the same for their [[children]], and yet are
very willing that they should be beaten, if those very games detain them
from the studies, whereby they would have them attain to be the givers
of them. look with [[pity]], [[lord]], on these things, and deliver us who call
upon thee now; deliver those too who call not on thee yet, that they may
call on thee, and thou mayest deliver them.

  as a boy, then, i had already heard of an eternal [[life]], promised
us through the [[humility]] of the [[lord]] our [[god]] stooping to our [[pride]]; and
even from the womb of my [[mother]], who greatly hoped in thee, i was sealed
with the mark of his cross and salted with his salt. thou sawest, [[lord]],
how while yet a boy, being seized on a [[time]] with sudden oppression of
the stomach, and like near to death--thou sawest, my [[god]] (for thou wert
my keeper), with what eagerness and what [[faith]] i sought, from the pious
care of my [[mother]] and thy [[church]], the [[mother]] of us all, the baptism of
thy [[christ]], my [[god]] and [[lord]]. whereupon the [[mother]] of my flesh, being
much troubled (since, with a [[heart]] pure in thy [[faith]], she even more
lovingly travailed in birth of my salvation), would in eager haste
have provided for my consecration and cleansing by the health-giving
sacraments, confessing thee, [[lord]] [[jesus]], for the remission of sins [[sin]],
unless i had suddenly recovered. and so, as if i must needs be
again polluted should i [[live]], my cleansing was deferred, because the
defilements of [[sin]] would, after that washing, bring greater and more
perilous guilt. i then already believed: and my [[mother]], and the whole
household, except my [[father]]: yet did not he prevail over the [[power]] of my
mother's piety in me, that as he did not yet [[believe]], so neither
should i. for it was her earnest [[care]] that thou my [[god]], rather than he,
shouldest be my [[father]]; and in this thou didst aid her to prevail over
her husband, whom she, the [[better]], obeyed, therein also obeying thee,
who hast so commanded.

  i beseech thee, my [[god]], i would fain [[know]], if so thou willest, for
what [[purpose]] my baptism was then deferred? was it for my [[good]] that the
rein was laid loose, as it were, upon me, for me to [[sin]]? or was it not
laid loose? if not, why does it still echo in our ears on all sides,
"let him alone, let him do as he will, for he is not yet baptised?" but
as to bodily health, no one says, "let him be worse wounded, for he is
not yet healed." how much [[better]] then, had i been at once healed; and
then, by my friends' and my own, my soul's recovered health had been
kept safe in thy keeping who gavest it. [[better]] truly. but how many and
great waves of temptation seemed to hang over me after my boyhood! these
my [[mother]] foresaw; and preferred to expose to them the clay whence i
might afterwards be moulded, than the very cast, when made.

  in boyhood itself, however (so much less dreaded for me than youth),
i loved not study, and hated to be forced to it. yet i was forced; and
this was well done towards me, but i did not well; for, unless forced, i
had not learnt. but no one doth well against his will, even though what
he doth, be well. yet neither did they well who forced me, but what was
well came to me from thee, my [[god]]. for they were regardless how i should
employ what they forced me to learn, except to satiate the insatiate
desires of a wealthy beggary, and a shameful [[glory]]. but thou, by whom
the very hairs of our head are numbered, didst use for my [[good]] the error
of all who urged me to learn; and my own, who would not learn, thou
didst use for my punishment--a fit penalty for one, so small a boy and
so [[great]] a sinner. so by those who did not well, thou didst well for me;
and by my own [[sin]] thou didst justly punish me. for thou hast commanded,
and so it is, that every inordinate affection should be its own
punishment.

but why did i so much hate the [[greek]], which i [[studied]] as a boy? i do not
yet fully [[know]]. for the latin i loved; not what my first masters, but
what the so-called grammarians taught me. for those first lessons,
reading, writing and arithmetic, i [[thought]] as [[great]] a burden and penalty
as any [[greek]]. and yet whence was this too, but from the [[sin]] and vanity
of this [[life]], because i was flesh, and a breath that passeth away and
cometh not again? for those first lessons were [[better]] certainly, because
more [[certain]]; by them i obtained, and still retain, the [[power]] of reading
what i find written, and myself writing what i will; whereas in the
others, i was forced to learn the wanderings of one [[aeneas]], forgetful of
my own, and to weep for [[dead]] dido, because she killed herself for [[love]];
the while, with dry [[eyes]], i endured my miserable [[self]] dying among these
things, far from thee, o [[god]] my [[life]].

for what more miserable than a miserable being who commiserates not
himself; weeping the [[death]] of dido for [[love]] to [[aeneas]], but weeping not
his own [[death]] for want of [[love]] to thee, o [[god]]. thou [[light]] of my [[heart]],
thou bread of my inmost [[soul]], thou [[power]] who givest vigour to my [[mind]],
who quickenest my thoughts [[thought]], i loved thee not. i committed fornication
against thee, and all around me thus fornicating there echoed "well
done! well done!" for the [[friendship]] of this [[world]] is fornication
against thee; and "well done! well done!" echoes on till one is ashamed
not to be thus a [[man]]. and for all this i wept not, i who wept for dido
slain, and "seeking by the [[sword]] a stroke and wound extreme," myself
seeking the while a worse extreme, the extremest and lowest of thy
creatures, having forsaken thee, [[earth]] passing into the [[earth]]. and
if forbid to [[read]] all this, i was [[grieved]] that i might not [[read]] what
grieved me. madness like this is [[thought]] a higher and a richer learning,
than that by which i learned to [[read]] and write.

but now, my [[god]], cry thou aloud in my [[soul]]; and let thy [[truth]] tell me,
"not so, not so. far [[better]] was that first study." for, lo, i would
readily forget the wanderings of [[aeneas]] and all the rest, rather than
how to [[read]] and write. but over the entrance of the grammar school is a
vail drawn! true; yet is this not so much an emblem of aught recondite,
as a cloak of error. let not those, whom i no longer [[fear]], cry out
against me, while i confess to thee, my [[god]], whatever my [[soul]] will, and
acquiesce in the condemnation of my [[evil]] ways, that i may [[love]] thy
good ways. let not either buyers or sellers of grammar-learning cry out
against me. for if i [[question]] them whether it be true that [[aeneas]] came
on a [[time]] to [[carthage]], as the poet tells, the less learned will reply
that they [[know]] not, the more learned that he never did. but should i ask
with what letters the name "aeneas" is written, every one who has
learnt this will [[answer]] me aright, as to the signs which [[men]] have
conventionally settled. if, again, i should ask which might be forgotten
with least detriment to the concerns of [[life]], reading and writing or
these poetic fictions? who does not foresee what all must [[answer]] who
have not wholly forgotten themselves? i sinned, then, when as a boy i
preferred those empty to those more profitable studies, or rather loved
the one and hated the other. "one and one, two"; "two and two, four";
this was to me a hateful singsong: "the wooden horse lined with
armed [[men]]," and "the burning of troy," and "creusa's shade and sad
similitude," were the [[choice]] spectacle of my vanity.

why then did i hate the [[greek]] classics, which have the like tales? for
homer also curiously wove the like fictions, and is most sweetly [[vain]],
yet was he bitter to my boyish taste. and so i suppose would virgil
be to grecian [[children]], when forced to learn him as i was [[homer]].
difficulty, in [[truth]], the difficulty of a [[foreign]] tongue, dashed, as it
were, with gall all the sweetness of grecian fable. for not one word of
it did i [[understand]], and to make me [[understand]] i was urged vehemently
with cruel threats and punishments [[punishment]]. [[time]] was also (as an infant) i
knew no latin; but this i learned without [[fear]] or suffering, by mere
observation, amid the caresses of my nursery and jests of [[friends]],
smiling and sportively encouraging me. this i learned without any
pressure of [[punishment]] to urge me on, for my [[heart]] urged me to give
birth to its conceptions, which i could only do by learning words not of
those who taught, but of those who talked with me; in whose ears also i
gave birth to the thoughts [[thought]], whatever i conceived. no [[doubt]], then, that
a [[free]] curiosity has more [[force]] in our learning these things, than a
frightful enforcement. only this enforcement restrains the rovings of
that [[freedom]], through thy laws [[law]], o my [[god]], thy laws [[law]], from the master's
cane to the martyr's trials, being able to temper for us a wholesome
bitter, recalling us to thyself from that deadly [[pleasure]] which lures us
from thee.

hear, [[lord]], my prayer; let not my [[soul]] faint under thy discipline, nor
let me faint in confessing unto thee all thy mercies, whereby thou
hast drawn me out of all my most [[evil]] ways, that thou mightest become a
delight to me above all the allurements which i once pursued; that i may
most entirely [[love]] thee, and clasp thy hand with all my affections, and
thou mayest yet rescue me from every temptation, even unto the end. for
lo, o [[lord]], my [[king]] and my [[god]], for thy service be whatever useful
thing my [[childhood]] learned; for thy service, that i speak, write, [[read]],
reckon. for thou didst grant me thy discipline, while i was learning
vanities; and my [[sin]] of delighting in those vanities thou hast forgiven.
in them, indeed, i learnt many a useful word, but these may as well be
learned in things not [[vain]]; and that is the safe path for the steps of
youth.

but woe is thee, thou torrent of [[human]] custom! who shall stand against
thee? how long shalt thou not be dried up? how long roll the sons [[son]] of eve
into that huge and hideous ocean, which even they scarcely overpass who
climb the cross? did not i [[read]] in thee of jove the thunderer and the
adulterer? both, doubtless, he could not be; but so the feigned thunder
might countenance and pander to real adultery. and now which of our
gowned masters lends a sober ear to one who from their own school cries
out, "these were homer's fictions, transferring things [[human]] to the
gods; would he had brought down things [[divine]] to us!" yet more truly had
he said, "these are indeed his fictions; but attributing a [[divine]] nature
to wicked [[men]], that crimes might be no longer crimes, and whoso commits
them might seem to imitate not abandoned [[men]], but the celestial gods."

and yet, thou hellish torrent, into thee are cast the sons [[son]] of [[men]] with
rich rewards [[reward]], for compassing such learning; and a [[great]] solemnity is
made of it, when this is going on in the forum, within sight of laws
appointing a salary beside the scholar's payments; and thou lashest
thy rocks and roarest, "hence words are learnt; hence eloquence; most
necessary to gain your ends, or maintain opinions [[opinion]]." as if we should have
never known such words as "golden shower," "lap," "beguile," "temples
of the heavens [[heaven]]," or others in that passage, unless terence had brought
a lewd [[youth]] upon the stage, setting up [[jupiter]] as his [[example]] of
seduction.

         "viewing a picture, where the tale was drawn,
         of jove's descending in a golden shower
         to danae's lap a woman to beguile."

and then mark how he excites himself to [[lust]] as by celestial [[authority]]:

         "and what [[god]]?  [[great]] jove,
         who shakes heaven's highest temples with his thunder,

         and i, [[poor]] mortal [[man]], not do the same!
         i did it, and with all my [[heart]] i did it."

not one whit more easily are the words learnt for all this vileness;
but by their means the vileness is committed with less shame. not that
i blame the words, being, as it were, [[choice]] and precious vessels; but
that wine of error which is drunk to us in them by intoxicated teachers;
and if we, too, drink not, we are beaten, and have no sober [[judge]] to
whom we may appeal. yet, o my [[god]] (in whose presence i now without hurt
may [[remember]] this), all this unhappily i learnt willingly with great
delight, and for this was pronounced a hopeful boy.

bear with me, my [[god]], while i say somewhat of my wit, thy gift, and on
what dotages i wasted it. for a task was set me, troublesome enough to
my [[soul]], upon terms of [[praise]] or shame, and [[fear]] of stripes, to speak
the words of juno, as she raged and mourned that she could not

        "this trojan [[prince]] from latinum turn."

which words i had heard that juno never uttered; but we were forced to
go astray in the footsteps of these poetic fictions, and to say in prose
much what he expressed in verse. and his speaking was most applauded, in
whom the [[passions]] of rage and [[grief]] were most preeminent, and clothed
in the most fitting [[language]], maintaining the [[dignity]] of the [[character]].
what is it to me, o my true [[life]], my [[god]], that my declamation was
applauded above so many of my own [[age]] and class? is not all this smoke
and wind? and was there nothing else whereon to exercise my wit and
tongue? thy praises [[praise]], [[lord]], thy praises [[praise]] might have stayed the yet tender
shoot of my [[heart]] by the prop of thy scriptures [[scripture]]; so had it not trailed
away amid these empty trifles, a defiled prey for the fowls of the air.
for in more ways than one do [[men]] [[sacrifice]] to the rebellious angels.

but what marvel that i was thus carried away to vanities, and went out
from thy presence, o my [[god]], when [[men]] were set before me as models, who,
if in relating some action of theirs, in itself not ill, they committed
some barbarism or solecism, being censured, were abashed; but when
in [[rich]] and adorned and well-ordered discourse they related their own
disordered [[life]], being bepraised, they gloried? these things thou seest,
lord, and holdest thy [[peace]]; long-suffering, and plenteous in [[mercy]] and
truth. wilt thou hold thy [[peace]] for ever? and even now thou drawest out
of this horrible gulf the [[soul]] that seeketh thee, that thirsteth for
thy pleasures [[pleasure]], whose [[heart]] saith unto thee, i have sought thy face; thy
face, [[lord]], will i seek. for darkened affections is removal from thee.
for it is not by our feet, or [[change]] of place, that [[men]] leave thee, or
return unto thee. or did that thy younger [[son]] look out for horses or
chariots, or ships, fly with visible wings, or [[journey]] by the motion of
his limbs, that he might in a far [[country]] waste in riotous living all
thou gavest at his departure? a loving [[father]], when thou gavest, and
more loving unto him, when he returned empty. so then in lustful, that
is, in darkened affections, is the true distance from thy face.

behold, o [[lord]] [[god]], yea, behold patiently as thou art [[arts]] wont how carefully
the sons [[son]] of [[men]] observe the covenanted rules [[rule]] of letters and syllables
received from those who spake before them, neglecting the eternal
covenant of everlasting salvation received from thee. insomuch, that
a teacher or learner of the hereditary laws [[law]] of pronunciation will more
offend [[men]] by speaking without the aspirate, of a "uman being," in
despite of the laws [[law]] of grammar, than if he, a "human being," hate a
"human being" in despite of thine. as if any [[enemy]] could be more hurtful
than the [[hatred]] with which he is incensed against him; or could wound
more deeply him whom he persecutes, than he wounds his own [[soul]] by his
enmity. assuredly no [[science]] of letters can be so innate as the record
of [[conscience]], "that he is doing to another what from another he would
be loth to suffer." how deep are thy ways, o [[god]], thou only [[great]],
that sittest silent on high and by an unwearied [[law]] dispensing penal
blindness to lawless desires [[desire]]. in quest of the fame of eloquence, a man
standing before a [[human]] [[judge]], surrounded by a [[human]] throng, declaiming
against his [[enemy]] with fiercest [[hatred]], will take heed most watchfully,
lest, by an error of the tongue, he murder the word "human being"; but
takes no heed, lest, through the fury of his spirit, he murder the real
human being.

this was the [[world]] at whose gate unhappy i lay in my boyhood; this
the stage where i had feared more to commit a barbarism, than having
committed one, to envy those who had not. these things i speak and
confess to thee, my [[god]]; for which i had [[praise]] from them, whom i then
thought it all [[virtue]] to please. for i saw not the abyss of vileness,
wherein i was cast away from thine [[eyes]]. before them what more foul than
i was already, displeasing even such as myself? with innumerable lies
deceiving my tutor, my masters, my parents, from [[love]] of play, eagerness
to see [[vain]] shows and restlessness to imitate them! thefts also i
committed, from my parents' cellar and table, enslaved by greediness, or
that i might have to give to boys, who sold me their play, which all
the while they liked no less than i. in this play, too, i often
sought unfair conquests, conquered myself meanwhile by [[vain]] [[desire]] of
preeminence. and what could i so ill endure, or, when i detected it,
upbraided i so fiercely, as that i was doing to others? and for which
if, detected, i was upbraided, i chose rather to quarrel than to yield.
and is this the innocence of boyhood? not so, [[lord]], not so; i cry thy
mercy, my [[god]]. for these very sins [[sin]], as riper years succeed, these very
sins are transferred from tutors and masters, from nuts and balls and
sparrows, to magistrates and kings [[king]], to gold and manors and slaves [[slave]], just
as severer punishments [[punishment]] displace the cane. it was the low stature then of
childhood which thou our [[king]] didst commend as an emblem of lowliness,
when thou saidst, of such is the [[kingdom]] of [[heaven]].

yet, [[lord]], to thee, the creator and governor of the [[universe]], most
excellent and most [[good]], thanks were due to thee our [[god]], even hadst
thou destined for me boyhood only. for even then i was, i lived, and
felt; and had an implanted providence over my well-being--a trace of
that mysterious unity whence i was derived; i guarded by the inward
sense the entireness of my senses, and in these minute pursuits, and in
my thoughts [[thought]] on things minute, i learnt to delight in [[truth]], i hated to
be deceived, had a vigorous memory, was gifted with [[speech]], was
soothed by [[friendship]], avoided [[pain]], baseness, ignorance. in so small a
creature, what was not wonderful, not admirable? but all are gifts of
my [[god]]: it was not i who gave them me; and [[good]] these are, and these
together are myself. [[good]], then, is he that made me, and he is my [[good]];
and before him will i exult for every [[good]] which of a boy i had. for it
was my [[sin]], that not in him, but in his creatures-myself and others--i
sought for pleasures [[pleasure]], sublimities, truths [[truth]], and so fell headlong into
sorrows, confusions, errors. thanks be to thee, my joy and my glory
and my confidence, my [[god]], thanks be to thee for thy gifts; but do thou
preserve them to me. for so wilt thou preserve me, and those things
shall be enlarged and perfected which thou hast given me, and i myself
shall be with thee, since even to be thou hast given me.




book ii


i will now call to [[mind]] my [[past]] foulness, and the carnal corruptions of
my [[soul]]; not because i [[love]] them, but that i may [[love]] thee, o my [[god]].
for [[love]] of thy [[love]] i do it; reviewing my most wicked ways in the very
bitterness of my remembrance, that thou mayest grow sweet unto me (thou
sweetness never failing, thou blissful and assured sweetness); and
gathering me again out of that my dissipation, wherein i was torn
piecemeal, while turned from thee, the one [[good]], i lost myself among a
multiplicity of things. for i even burnt in my [[youth]] heretofore, to be
satiated in things below; and i dared to grow wild again, with these
various and shadowy loves [[love]]: my [[beauty]] consumed away, and i stank in thine
eyes; pleasing myself, and desirous to please in the [[eyes]] of [[men]].

and what was it that i delighted in, but to [[love]], and be loved? but
i kept not the measure of [[love]], of [[mind]] to [[mind]], friendship's bright
boundary: but out of the muddy concupiscence of the flesh, and the
bubblings of [[youth]], mists fumed up which beclouded and overcast my
heart, that i could not discern the clear brightness of [[love]] from the
fog of lustfulness. both did confusedly boil in me, and hurried my
unstayed [[youth]] over the precipice of unholy desires [[desire]], and sunk me in a
gulf of flagitiousnesses. thy wrath had gathered over me, and i knew it
not. i was grown deaf by the clanking of the chain of my [[mortality]], the
punishment of the [[pride]] of my [[soul]], and i strayed further from thee,
and thou lettest me alone, and i was tossed about, and wasted, and
dissipated, and i boiled over in my fornications, and thou heldest thy
peace, o thou my tardy joy! thou then heldest thy [[peace]], and i wandered
further and further from thee, into more and more fruitless seed-plots
of sorrows [[sorrow]], with a proud dejectedness, and a restless weariness.

oh! that some one had then attempered my disorder, and turned to account
the fleeting beauties [[beauty]] of these, the extreme points of thy creation! had
put a bound to their pleasureableness, that so the tides of my youth
might have cast themselves upon the [[marriage]] shore, if they could not be
calmed, and kept within the object of a [[family]], as thy [[law]] prescribes,
o [[lord]]: who this way formest the offspring of this our [[death]], being
able with a gentle hand to blunt the thorns which were excluded from thy
paradise? for thy omnipotency is not far from us, even when we be far
from thee. else ought i more watchfully to have heeded the voice from
the clouds: nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh, but i
spare you. and it is [[good]] for a [[man]] not to touch a woman. and, he that
is unmarried thinketh of the things of the [[lord]], how he may please the
lord; but he that is [[married]] careth for the things of this [[world]], how he
may please his [[wife]].

to these words i should have listened more attentively, and being
severed for the [[kingdom]] of heaven's sake, had more happily awaited thy
embraces; but i, [[poor]] wretch, foamed like a troubled sea, following the
rushing of my own tide, forsaking thee, and exceeded all thy limits; yet
i escaped not thy scourges. for what mortal can? for thou wert ever with
me mercifully rigorous, and besprinkling with most bitter alloy all my
unlawful pleasures [[pleasure]]: that i might seek pleasures [[pleasure]] without alloy. but where
to find such, i could not discover, save in thee, o [[lord]], who teachest
by [[sorrow]], and woundest us, to heal; and killest us, lest we [[die]] from
thee. where was i, and how far was i exiled from the delights of thy
house, in that sixteenth year of the [[age]] of my flesh, when the madness
of [[lust]] (to which [[human]] shamelessness giveth [[free]] licence, though
unlicensed by thy laws) took the [[rule]] over me, and i resigned myself
wholly to it? my [[friends]] meanwhile took no [[care]] by [[marriage]] to save my
fall; their only [[care]] was that i should learn to speak excellently, and
be a persuasive orator.

for that year were my studies intermitted: whilst after my return from
madaura (a neighbour [[city]], whither i had journeyed to learn grammar and
rhetoric), the expenses for a further [[journey]] to [[carthage]] were being
provided for me; and that rather by the resolution than the means of my
father, who was but a [[poor]] freeman of thagaste. to whom tell i this? not
to thee, my [[god]]; but before thee to mine own [[kind]], even to that small
portion of [[mankind]] as may [[light]] upon these writings of mine. and to what
purpose? that whosoever reads this, may [[think]] out of what depths we are
to cry unto thee. for what is nearer to thine ears than a confessing
heart, and a [[life]] of [[faith]]? who did not extol my [[father]], for that beyond
the ability of his means, he would furnish his [[son]] with all necessaries
for a far [[journey]] for his studies' sake? for many far abler citizens
did no such thing for their [[children]]. but yet this same [[father]] had no
concern how i grew towards thee, or how chaste i were; so that i were
but copious in [[speech]], however barren i were to thy [[culture]], o [[god]], who
art the only true and [[good]] [[lord]] of thy field, my [[heart]].

but while in that my sixteenth year i lived with my parents, leaving all
school for a while (a season of idleness being interposed through the
narrowness of my parents' fortunes), the briers of unclean desires [[desire]] grew
rank over my head, and there was no hand to root them out. when that my
father saw me at the baths, now growing towards manhood, and endued
with a restless youthfulness, he, as already hence anticipating his
descendants, gladly told it to my [[mother]]; rejoicing in that tumult of
the senses wherein the [[world]] forgetteth thee its creator, and becometh
enamoured of thy creature, instead of thyself, through the fumes of that
invisible wine of its self-will, turning aside and bowing down to the
very basest things. but in my mother's breast thou hadst already begun
thy temple, and the foundation of thy holy habitation, whereas my
father was as yet but a catechumen, and that but recently. she then was
startled with a holy [[fear]] and trembling; and though i was not as yet
baptised, feared for me those crooked ways in which they walk who turn
their back to thee, and not their face.

woe is me! and dare i say that thou heldest thy [[peace]], o my [[god]], while i
wandered further from thee? didst thou then indeed hold thy [[peace]] to me?
and whose but thine were these words which by my [[mother]], thy faithful
one, thou sangest in my ears? nothing whereof sunk into my [[heart]], so as
to do it. for she wished, and i [[remember]] in private with [[great]] anxiety
warned me, "not to commit fornication; but especially never to defile
another man's [[man]] [[wife]]." these seemed to me womanish advices, which i should
blush to obey. but they were thine, and i knew it not: and i thought
thou wert silent and that it was she who spake; by whom thou wert not
silent unto me; and in her wast despised by me, her [[son]], the [[son]] of thy
handmaid, thy servant. but i knew it not; and ran headlong with such
blindness, that amongst my equals [[equal]] i was ashamed of a less shamelessness,
when i heard them boast of their flagitiousness, yea, and the more
boasting, the more they were degraded: and i took [[pleasure]], not only in
the [[pleasure]] of the deed, but in the [[praise]]. what is worthy of dispraise
but [[vice]]? but i made myself worse than i was, that i might not be
dispraised; and when in any thing i had not sinned as the abandoned
ones, i would say that i had done what i had not done, that i might not
seem contemptible in proportion as i was [[innocent]]; or of less account,
the more chaste.

behold with what companions i walked the streets of [[babylon]], and
wallowed in the mire thereof, as if in a bed of spices and precious
ointments. and that i might cleave the faster to its very centre, the
invisible [[enemy]] trod me down, and seduced me, for that i was easy to be
seduced. neither did the [[mother]] of my flesh (who had now fled out of
the centre of [[babylon]], yet went more slowly in the skirts thereof as
she advised me to chastity, so heed what she had heard of me from her
husband, as to restrain within the bounds of conjugal affection, if it
could not be pared away to the quick) what she [[felt]] to be pestilent
at [[present]] and for the future dangerous. she heeded not this, for she
feared lest a [[wife]] should prove a clog and hindrance to my hopes [[hope]]. not
those hopes [[hope]] of the [[world]] to come, which my [[mother]] reposed in thee; but
the [[hope]] of learning, which both my parents were too desirous i should
attain; my [[father]], because he had next to no [[thought]] of thee, and of
me but [[vain]] conceits; my [[mother]], because she accounted that those
usual courses of learning would not only be no hindrance, but even some
furtherance towards attaining thee. for thus i conjecture, recalling, as
well as i may, the disposition of my parents. the reins, meantime, were
slackened to me, beyond all temper of due severity, to spend my [[time]] in
sport, yea, even unto dissoluteness in whatsoever i affected. and in all
was a mist, intercepting from me, o my [[god]], the brightness of thy [[truth]];
and mine [[iniquity]] burst out as from very fatness.

theft is punished by thy [[law]], o [[lord]], and the [[law]] written in the hearts
of [[men]], which [[iniquity]] itself effaces not. for what thief will abide a
thief? not even a [[rich]] thief, one stealing through want. yet i lusted to
thieve, and did it, compelled by no [[hunger]], nor [[poverty]], but through a
cloyedness of well-doing, and a pamperedness of [[iniquity]]. for i stole
that, of which i had enough, and much [[better]]. nor cared i to enjoy what
i stole, but joyed in the theft and [[sin]] itself. a pear tree there was
near our vineyard, laden with fruit, tempting neither for colour nor
taste. to shake and rob this, some lewd [[young]] fellows of us went, late
one night (having according to our pestilent custom prolonged our sports
in the streets till then), and took huge loads, not for our eating, but
to fling to the very hogs, having only tasted them. and this, but to
do what we liked only, because it was misliked. behold my [[heart]], o
god, behold my [[heart]], which thou hadst [[pity]] upon in the bottom of the
bottomless pit. now, behold, let my [[heart]] tell thee what it sought
there, that i should be gratuitously [[evil]], having no temptation to ill,
but the ill itself. it was foul, and i loved it; i loved to perish,
i loved mine own [[fault]], not that for which i was faulty, but my fault
itself. foul [[soul]], falling from thy firmament to utter destruction; not
seeking aught through the shame, but the shame itself!

for there is an attractiveness in beautiful bodies [[body]], in gold and silver,
and all things; and in bodily touch, sympathy hath much influence, and
each other sense hath his proper object answerably tempered. worldy
honour hath also its grace, and the [[power]] of overcoming, and of mastery;
whence springs also the thirst of [[revenge]]. but yet, to obtain all these,
we may not depart from thee, o [[lord]], nor decline from thy [[law]]. the life
also which here we [[live]] hath its own enchantment, through a certain
proportion of its own, and a correspondence with all things beautiful
here below. [[human]] [[friendship]] also is endeared with a sweet tie, by
reason of the unity formed of many souls [[soul]]. upon [[occasion]] of all these,
and the like, is [[sin]] committed, while through an immoderate inclination
towards these goods [[good]] of the lowest order, the [[better]] and higher are
forsaken,--thou, our [[lord]] [[god]], thy [[truth]], and thy [[law]]. for these lower
things have their delights, but not like my [[god]], who made all things;
for in him doth the righteous delight, and he is the joy of the upright
in [[heart]].

when, then, we ask why a crime was done, we [[believe]] it not, unless it
appear that there might have been some [[desire]] of obtaining some of those
which we called lower goods [[good]], or a [[fear]] of losing them. for they are
beautiful and comely; although compared with those higher and beatific
goods, they be abject and low. a [[man]] hath murdered another; why? he
loved his [[wife]] or his estate; or would rob for his own livelihood; or
feared to lose some such things by him; or, wronged, was on [[fire]] to be
revenged. would any commit murder upon no cause, delighted simply in
murdering? who would [[believe]] it? for as for that furious and savage [[man]],
of whom it is said that he was gratuitously [[evil]] and cruel, yet is the
cause assigned; "lest" (saith he) "through idleness hand or [[heart]] should
grow inactive." and to what end? that, through that practice of guilt,
he might, having taken the [[city]], attain to honours [[honour]], [[empire]], riches [[rich]], and
be freed from [[fear]] of the laws [[law]], and his embarrassments from domestic
needs, and [[consciousness]] of villainies. so then, not even catiline
himself loved his own villainies, but something else, for whose sake he
did them.

what then did wretched i so [[love]] in thee, thou theft of mine, thou deed
of darkness, in that sixteenth year of my [[age]]? lovely thou wert not,
because thou wert theft. but art [[arts]] thou any thing, that thus i speak to
thee? [[fair]] were the pears we stole, because they were thy creation, thou
fairest of all, creator of all, thou [[good]] [[god]]; [[god]], the [[sovereign]] good
and my true [[good]]. [[fair]] were those pears, but not them did my wretched
soul [[desire]]; for i had store of [[better]], and those i gathered, only that
i might steal. for, when gathered, i flung them away, my only feast
therein being my own [[sin]], which i was pleased to enjoy. for if aught
of those pears came within my mouth, what sweetened it was the [[sin]].
and now, o [[lord]] my [[god]], i enquire what in that theft delighted me; and
behold it hath no loveliness; i mean not such loveliness as in justice
and [[wisdom]]; nor such as is in the [[mind]] and memory, and senses, and
animal [[life]] of [[man]]; nor yet as the stars are glorious and beautiful in
their orbs; or the [[earth]], or sea, full of embryo-life, replacing by its
birth that which decayeth; nay, nor even that false and shadowy beauty
which belongeth to deceiving vices [[vice]].

for so doth [[pride]] imitate exaltedness; whereas thou alone art [[arts]] god
exalted over all. [[ambition]], what seeks it, but honours [[honour]] and [[glory]]?
whereas thou alone art [[arts]] to be honoured above all, and glorious for
evermore. the [[cruelty]] of the [[great]] would fain be feared; but who is
to be feared but [[god]] alone, out of whose [[power]] what can be wrested or
withdrawn? when, or where, or whither, or by whom? the tendernesses of
the wanton would fain be counted [[love]]: yet is nothing more tender than
thy charity; nor is aught loved more healthfully than that thy [[truth]],
bright and beautiful above all. curiosity makes semblance of a desire
of [[knowledge]]; whereas thou supremely knowest all. yea, ignorance
and foolishness itself is cloaked under the name of simplicity and
uninjuriousness; because nothing is found more [[single]] than thee: and
what less injurious, since they are his own works [[work]] which injure the
sinner? yea, sloth would fain be at rest; but what stable rest besides
the [[lord]]? luxury affects to be called plenty and abundance; but thou art
the fulness and never-failing plenteousness of incorruptible pleasures [[pleasure]].
prodigality presents [[present]] a shadow of liberality: but thou art [[arts]] the most
overflowing giver of all [[good]]. covetousness would possess many things;
and thou possessest all things. envy disputes for excellency: what more
excellent than thou? anger seeks [[revenge]]: who revenges more justly
than thou? [[fear]] startles at things unwonted and sudden, which endangers
things beloved, and takes forethought for their safety; but to thee what
unwonted or sudden, or who separateth from thee what thou lovest? or
where but with thee is unshaken safety? [[grief]] pines away for things
lost, the delight of its desires [[desire]]; because it would have nothing taken
from it, as nothing can from thee.

thus doth the [[soul]] commit fornication, when she turns from thee, seeking
without thee, what she findeth not pure and untainted, till she returns
to thee. thus all pervertedly imitate thee, who remove far from thee,
and lift themselves up against thee. but even by thus imitating thee,
they imply thee to be the creator of all [[nature]]; whence there is no
place whither altogether to retire from thee. what then did i [[love]] in
that theft? and wherein did i even corruptly and pervertedly imitate my
lord? did i [[wish]] even by stealth to do contrary to thy [[law]], because
by [[power]] i could not, so that being a [[prisoner]], i might mimic a maimed
liberty by doing with impunity things unpermitted me, a darkened
likeness of thy omnipotency? behold, thy servant, fleeing from his [[lord]],
and obtaining a shadow. o rottenness, o monstrousness of [[life]], and depth
of death! could i like what i might not, only because i might not?

what shall i render unto the [[lord]], that, whilst my memory recalls these
things, my [[soul]] is not affrighted at them? i will [[love]] thee, o [[lord]],
and thank thee, and confess unto thy name; because thou hast forgiven me
these so [[great]] and heinous deeds of mine. to thy grace i ascribe it, and
to thy [[mercy]], that thou hast melted away my sins [[sin]] as it were ice. to thy
grace i ascribe also whatsoever i have not done of [[evil]]; for what might
i not have done, who even loved a [[sin]] for its own sake? yea, all i
confess to have been forgiven me; both what evils [[evil]] i committed by my own
wilfulness, and what by thy guidance i committed not. what [[man]] is
he, who, weighing his own infirmity, dares to ascribe his purity and
innocency to his own [[strength]]; that so he should [[love]] thee the less, as
if he had less needed thy [[mercy]], whereby thou remittest sins [[sin]] to those
that turn to thee? for whosoever, called by thee, followed thy voice,
and avoided those things which he reads me recalling and confessing
of myself, let him not scorn me, who being sick, was cured by that
physician, through whose aid it was that he was not, or rather was less,
sick: and for this let him [[love]] thee as much, yea and more; since by
whom he sees me to have been recovered from such deep consumption of
sin, by him he sees himself to have been from the like consumption of
sin preserved.

what fruit had i then (wretched man!) in those things, of the
remembrance whereof i am now ashamed? especially, in that theft which
i loved for the theft's sake; and it too was nothing, and therefore the
more miserable i, who loved it. yet alone i had not done it: such was i
then, i [[remember]], alone i had never done it. i loved then in it also
the company of the accomplices, with whom i did it? i did not then love
nothing else but the theft, yea rather i did [[love]] nothing else; for that
circumstance of the company was also nothing. what is, in [[truth]]? who can
teach me, save he that enlighteneth my [[heart]], and discovereth its
dark corners? what is it which hath come into my [[mind]] to enquire, and
discuss, and consider? for had i then loved the pears i stole,
and wished to enjoy them, i might have done it alone, had the bare
commission of the theft sufficed to attain my [[pleasure]]; nor needed
i have inflamed the itching of my desires [[desire]] by the excitement of
accomplices. but since my [[pleasure]] was not in those pears, it was in the
offence itself, which the company of fellow-sinners occasioned.

what then was this feeling? for of a [[truth]] it was too foul: and woe was
me, who had it. but yet what was it? who can [[understand]] his errors? it
was the [[sport]], which as it were tickled our hearts [[heart]], that we beguiled
those who little [[thought]] what we were doing, and much disliked it. why
then was my delight of such sort that i did it not alone? because none
doth ordinarily laugh alone? ordinarily no one; yet laughter sometimes
masters [[men]] alone and singly when no one whatever is with them, if
anything very ludicrous presents [[present]] itself to their senses or [[mind]]. yet
i had not done this alone; alone i had never done it. behold my [[god]],
before thee, the vivid remembrance of my [[soul]]; alone, i had never
committed that theft wherein what i stole pleased me not, but that
i stole; nor had it alone liked me to do it, nor had i done it. o
friendship too unfriendly! thou incomprehensible inveigler of the [[soul]],
thou greediness to do mischief out of mirth and wantonness, thou thirst
of others' loss, without [[lust]] of my own gain or [[revenge]]: but when it is
said, "let's go, let's do it," we are ashamed not to be shameless.

who can disentangle that twisted and intricate knottiness? foul is it: i
hate to [[think]] on it, to look on it. but thee i long for, o righteousness
and innocency, beautiful and comely to all pure [[eyes]], and of a
satisfaction unsating. with thee is rest entire, and [[life]] imperturbable.
whoso enters into thee, enters into the joy of his [[lord]]: and shall not
fear, and shall do excellently in the all-excellent. i sank away from
thee, and i wandered, o my [[god]], too much astray from thee my stay, in
these days of my [[youth]], and i became to myself a barren [[land]].




book iii


to [[carthage]] i came, where there sang all around me in my ears a cauldron
of unholy loves [[love]]. i loved not yet, yet i loved to [[love]], and out of a
deep-seated want, i hated myself for wanting not. i sought what i might
love, in [[love]] with loving, and safety i hated, and a way without snares.
for within me was a famine of that inward food, thyself, my [[god]]; yet,
through that famine i was not hungered; but was without all longing for
incorruptible sustenance, not because filled therewith, but the more
empty, the more i loathed it. for this cause my [[soul]] was sickly and full
of sores, it miserably cast itself forth, desiring to be scraped by the
touch of objects of sense. yet if these had not a [[soul]], they would not
be objects of [[love]]. to [[love]] then, and to be beloved, was sweet to
me; but more, when i obtained to enjoy the [[person]] i loved, i defiled,
therefore, the spring of [[friendship]] with the filth of concupiscence, and
i beclouded its brightness with the hell of lustfulness; and thus
foul and unseemly, i would fain, through exceeding vanity, be fine
and courtly. i fell headlong then into the [[love]] wherein i longed to be
ensnared. my [[god]], my [[mercy]], with how much gall didst thou out of thy
great goodness besprinkle for me that sweetness? for i was both beloved,
and secretly arrived at the bond of enjoying; and was with joy fettered
with sorrow-bringing bonds, that i might be scourged with the iron
burning rods of [[jealousy]], and suspicions, and fears [[fear]], and angers, and
quarrels.

stage-plays also carried me away, full of images of my miseries, and of
fuel to my [[fire]]. why is it, that [[man]] desires [[desire]] to be made [[sad]], beholding
doleful and tragical things, which yet himself would no means suffer?
yet he desires [[desire]] as a spectator to [[feel]] [[sorrow]] at them, and this very
sorrow is his [[pleasure]]. what is this but a miserable madness? for a man
is the more affected with these actions, the less [[free]] he is from such
affections. howsoever, when he suffers in his own [[person]], it uses to be
styled misery: when he compassionates others, then it is [[mercy]]. but what
sort of compassion is this for feigned and scenical [[passions]]? for the
auditor is not called on to relieve, but only to grieve: and he applauds
the actor of these fictions the more, the more he grieves. and if the
calamities of those persons [[person]] (whether of old times [[time]], or mere fiction)
be so acted, that the spectator is not moved to tears, he goes away
disgusted and criticising; but if he be moved to passion, he stays
intent, and weeps for joy.

are griefs then too loved? verily all [[desire]] joy. or whereas no man
likes to be miserable, is he yet pleased to be merciful? which because
it cannot be without passion, for this [[reason]] alone are [[passions]] loved?
this also springs from that vein of [[friendship]]. but whither goes that
vein? whither flows it? wherefore runs it into that torrent of pitch
bubbling forth those monstrous tides of foul lustfulness, into which it
is wilfully changed and transformed, being of its own will precipitated
and corrupted from its heavenly clearness? shall compassion then be
put away? by no means. be griefs then sometimes loved. but beware of
uncleanness, o my [[soul]], under the guardianship of my [[god]], the [[god]] of our
fathers, who is to be praised and exalted above all for ever, beware of
uncleanness. for i have not now ceased to [[pity]]; but then in the theatres
i rejoiced with lovers when they wickedly enjoyed one another, although
this was imaginary only in the play. and when they lost one another, as
if very compassionate, i sorrowed with them, yet had my delight in both.
but now i much more [[pity]] him that rejoiceth in his wickedness, than him
who is [[thought]] to suffer hardship, by missing some pernicious [[pleasure]],
and the loss of some miserable felicity. this certainly is the truer
mercy, but in it [[grief]] delights not. for though he that grieves for the
miserable, be commended for his office of charity; yet had he, who is
genuinely compassionate, rather there were nothing for him to grieve
for. for if [[good]] will be ill willed (which can never be), then may
he, who truly and sincerely commiserates, [[wish]] there might be some
miserable, that he might commiserate. some [[sorrow]] may then be allowed,
none loved. for thus dost thou, o [[lord]] [[god]], who lovest souls [[soul]] far more
purely than we, and hast more incorruptibly [[pity]] on them, yet are
wounded with no sorrowfulness. and who is sufficient for these things?

but i, miserable, then loved to grieve, and sought out what to grieve
at, when in another's and that feigned and personated misery, that
acting [[best]] pleased me, and attracted me the most vehemently, which
drew tears from me. what marvel that an unhappy sheep, straying from
thy flock, and impatient of thy keeping, i became infected with a foul
disease? and hence the [[love]] of griefs; not such as should sink deep into
me; for i loved not to suffer, what i loved to look on; but such as upon
hearing their fictions should lightly scratch the surface; upon which,
as on envenomed nails, followed inflamed swelling, impostumes, and a
putrefied sore. my [[life]] being such, was it [[life]], o my [[god]]?

and thy faithful [[mercy]] hovered over me afar. upon how grievous
iniquities consumed i myself, pursuing a sacrilegious curiosity, that
having forsaken thee, it might bring me to the [[treacherous]] abyss, and
the beguiling service of devils [[devil]], to whom i sacrificed my [[evil]] actions,
and in all these things thou didst scourge me! i dared even, while thy
solemnities were celebrated within the walls of thy [[church]], to [[desire]],
and to compass a [[business]] deserving [[death]] for its fruits, for which thou
scourgedst me with grievous punishments [[punishment]], though nothing to my [[fault]],
o thou my exceeding [[mercy]], my [[god]], my refuge from those terrible
destroyers, among whom i wandered with a stiff neck, withdrawing
further from thee, loving mine own ways, and not thine; loving a vagrant
liberty.

those studies also, which were accounted commendable, had a view to
excelling in the courts of litigation; the more bepraised, the craftier.
such is men's blindness, glorying even in their blindness. and now i
was [[chief]] in the rhetoric school, whereat i joyed proudly, and i swelled
with arrogancy, though (lord, thou knowest) far quieter and altogether
removed from the subvertings of those "subverters" (for this ill-omened
and devilish name was the very badge of gallantry) among whom i lived,
with a shameless shame that i was not even as they. with them i lived,
and was sometimes delighted with their [[friendship]], whose doings i ever
did abhor--i.e., their "subvertings," wherewith they wantonly persecuted
the modesty of strangers, which they disturbed by a gratuitous jeering,
feeding thereon their malicious birth. nothing can be liker the very
actions of devils [[devil]] than these. what then could they be more truly called
than "subverters"? themselves subverted and altogether perverted first,
the deceiving spirits secretly deriding and seducing them, wherein
themselves delight to jeer at and [[deceive]] others.

among such as these, in that unsettled [[age]] of mine, learned i books
of eloquence, wherein i [[desired]] to be eminent, out of a damnable and
vainglorious end, a joy in [[human]] vanity. in the ordinary course of
study, i fell upon a [[certain]] [[book]] of cicero, whose [[speech]] almost all
admire, not so his [[heart]]. this [[book]] of his contains an exhortation
to [[philosophy]], and is called "hortensius." but this [[book]] altered my
affections, and turned my prayers to thyself o [[lord]]; and made me have
other purposes [[purpose]] and desires [[desire]]. every [[vain]] [[hope]] at once became worthless to
me; and i longed with an incredibly burning [[desire]] for an immortality of
wisdom, and began now to arise, that i might return to thee. for not
to sharpen my tongue (which thing i seemed to be purchasing with my
mother's allowances, in that my nineteenth year, my [[father]] being dead
two years before), not to sharpen my tongue did i employ that [[book]]; nor
did it infuse into me its style, but its matter.

how did i burn then, my [[god]], how did i burn to re-mount from earthly
things to thee, nor knew i what thou wouldest do with me? for with thee
is [[wisdom]]. but the [[love]] of [[wisdom]] is in [[greek]] called "philosophy,"
with which that [[book]] inflamed me. some there be that seduce through
philosophy, under a [[great]], and smooth, and honourable name colouring and
disguising their own errors: and almost all who in that and former ages
were such, are in that [[book]] censured and set forth: there also is
made plain that wholesome [[advice]] of thy spirit, by thy [[good]] and devout
servant: beware lest any [[man]] spoil you through [[philosophy]] and vain
deceit, after the tradition of [[men]], after the rudiments of the [[world]],
and not after [[christ]]. for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead
bodily. and since at that [[time]] (thou, o [[light]] of my [[heart]], knowest)
apostolic [[scripture]] was not known to me, i was delighted with that
exhortation, so far only, that i was thereby strongly roused, and
kindled, and inflamed to [[love]], and seek, and obtain, and hold, and
embrace not this or that sect, but [[wisdom]] itself whatever it were; and
this alone checked me thus unkindled, that the name of [[christ]] was not
in it. for this name, according to thy [[mercy]], o [[lord]], this name of
my saviour thy [[son]], had my tender [[heart]], even with my mother's milk,
devoutly drunk in and deeply treasured; and whatsoever was without that
name, though never so learned, polished, or true, took not entire hold
of me.

i resolved then to bend my [[mind]] to the holy scriptures [[scripture]], that i might see
what they were. but behold, i see a thing not understood by the proud,
nor laid open to [[children]], lowly in access, in its recesses lofty, and
veiled with mysteries; and i was not such as could enter into it, or
stoop my neck to [[follow]] its steps. for not as i now speak, did i feel
when i turned to those scriptures [[scripture]]; but they seemed to me unworthy to be
compared to the stateliness of tully: for my swelling [[pride]] shrunk from
their lowliness, nor could my sharp wit pierce the interior thereof. yet
were they such as would grow up in a little one. but i disdained to be a
little one; and, swollen with [[pride]], took myself to be a [[great]] one.

therefore i fell among [[men]] proudly doting, exceeding carnal and prating,
in whose mouths were the snares of the [[devil]], limed with the mixture of
the syllables of thy name, and of our [[lord]] [[jesus]] [[christ]], and of the holy
ghost, the paraclete, our comforter. these names departed not out of
their mouth, but so far forth as the sound only and the noise of the
tongue, for the [[heart]] was void of [[truth]]. yet they cried out "truth,
truth," and spake much thereof to me, yet it was not in them: but they
spake falsehood, not of thee only (who truly art [[arts]] truth), but even of
those elements of this [[world]], thy creatures. and i indeed ought to have
passed by even [[philosophers]] who spake [[truth]] concerning them, for love
of thee, my [[father]], supremely [[good]], [[beauty]] of all things beautiful.
o [[truth]], [[truth]], how inwardly did even then the marrow of my [[soul]] pant
after thee, when they often and diversely, and in many and huge books [[book]],
echoed of thee to me, though it was but an echo? and these were the
dishes wherein to me, hungering after thee, they, instead of thee,
served up the sun and moon, beautiful works [[work]] of thine, but yet thy works [[work]],
not thyself, no nor thy first works [[work]]. for thy [[spiritual]] works [[work]] are before
these corporeal works [[work]], celestial though they be, and shining. but i
hungered and thirsted not even after those first works [[work]] of thine, but
after thee thyself, the [[truth]], in whom is no variableness, neither
shadow of turning: yet they still set before me in those dishes,
glittering fantasies, than which [[better]] were it to [[love]] this very sun
(which is real to our sight at least), than those fantasies which by
our [[eyes]] [[deceive]] our [[mind]]. yet because i [[thought]] them to be thee, i fed
thereon; not eagerly, for thou didst not in them taste to me as thou
art; for thou wast not these emptinesses, nor was i nourished by them,
but exhausted rather. food in sleep shows very like our food awake; yet
are not those asleep nourished by it, for they are asleep. but those
were not even any way like to thee, as thou hast now spoken to me; for
those were corporeal fantasies, false bodies [[body]], than which these true
bodies, celestial or terrestrial, which with our fleshly sight we
behold, are far more [[certain]]: these things the beasts and birds discern
as well as we, and they are more [[certain]] than when we fancy them. and
again, we do with more certainty fancy them, than by them conjecture
other vaster and infinite bodies [[body]] which have no being. such empty husks
was i then fed on; and was not fed. but thou, my soul's [[love]], in looking
for whom i fail, that i may become [[strong]], art [[arts]] neither those bodies
which we see, though in [[heaven]]; nor those which we see not there; for
thou hast created them, nor dost thou account them among the chiefest of
thy works [[work]]. how far then art [[arts]] thou from those fantasies of mine, fantasies
of bodies [[body]] which altogether are not, than which the images of those
bodies, which are, are far more [[certain]], and more [[certain]] still the
bodies themselves, which yet thou art [[arts]] not; no, nor yet the [[soul]], which
is the [[life]] of the bodies [[body]]. so then, [[better]] and more [[certain]] is the life
of the bodies [[body]] than the bodies [[body]]. but thou art [[arts]] the [[life]] of souls [[soul]], the life
of lives [[life]], having [[life]] in thyself; and changest not, [[life]] of my [[soul]].

where then wert thou then to me, and how far from me? far verily was i
straying from thee, barred from the very husks of the swine, whom with
husks i fed. for how much [[better]] are the fables of poets and grammarians
than these snares? for verses, and poems, and "medea flying," are more
profitable truly than these men's five elements, variously disguised,
answering to five dens of darkness, which have no being, yet slay the
believer. for verses and poems i can turn to true food, and "medea
flying," though i did sing, i maintained not; though i heard it sung,
i believed not: but those things i did [[believe]]. woe, woe, by what steps
was i brought down to the depths of hell! toiling and turmoiling through
want of [[truth]], since i sought after thee, my [[god]] (to thee i confess
it, who hadst [[mercy]] on me, not as yet confessing), not according to the
understanding of the [[mind]], wherein thou willedst that i should excel
the beasts, but according to the sense of the flesh. but thou wert more
inward to me than my most inward part; and higher than my highest. i
lighted upon that bold woman, simple and knoweth nothing, shadowed out
in solomon, sitting at the door, and saying, [[eat]] ye bread of secrecies
willingly, and drink ye stolen waters which are sweet: she seduced me,
because she found my [[soul]] dwelling abroad in the eye of my flesh, and
ruminating on such food as through it i had devoured.

for other than this, that which really is i knew not; and was, as it
were through sharpness of wit, persuaded to assent to foolish deceivers,
when they [[asked]] me, "whence is [[evil]]?" "is [[god]] bounded by a bodily shape,
and has hairs and nails?" "are they to be esteemed righteous who had
many wives [[wife]] at once, and did kill [[men]], and [[sacrifice]] living creatures?"
at which i, in my ignorance, was much troubled, and departing from the
truth, seemed to myself to be making towards it; because as yet i knew
not that [[evil]] was nothing but a privation of [[good]], until at [[last]] a thing
ceases altogether to be; which how should i see, the sight of whose eyes
reached only to bodies [[body]], and of my [[mind]] to a phantasm? and i knew not god
to be a spirit, not one who hath parts extended in length and breadth,
or whose being was bulk; for every bulk is less in a part than in the
whole: and if it be infinite, it must be less in such part as is defined
by a [[certain]] space, than in its infinitude; and so is not wholly every
where, as spirit, as [[god]]. and what that should be in us, by which we
were like to [[god]], and might be rightly said to be after the image of
god, i was altogether ignorant.

nor knew i that true inward [[righteousness]] which judgeth not according
to custom, but out of the most rightful [[law]] of [[god]] almighty, whereby
the ways of places and times [[time]] were disposed according to those times [[time]] and
places; itself meantime being the same always and every where, not one
thing in one place, and another in another; according to which [[abraham]],
and isaac, and jacob, and [[moses]], and [[david]], were righteous, and all
those commended by the mouth of [[god]]; but were judged unrighteous by
silly [[men]], judging out of man's [[man]] [[judgment]], and measuring by their own
petty habits, the [[moral]] habits of the whole [[human]] [[race]]. as if in an
armory, one ignorant what were adapted to each part should cover his
head with greaves, or seek to be shod with a helmet, and [[complain]] that
they fitted not: or as if on a day when [[business]] is publicly stopped in
the afternoon, one were angered at not being allowed to keep open shop,
because he had been in the forenoon; or when in one house he observeth
some servant take a thing in his hand, which the butler is not suffered
to meddle with; or something permitted out of doors, which is forbidden
in the dining-room; and should be angry, that in one house, and one
family, the same thing is not allotted every where, and to all. even
such are they who are fretted to hear something to have been lawful
for righteous [[men]] formerly, which now is not; or that [[god]], for certain
temporal respects [[respect]], commanded them one thing, and these another, obeying
both the same [[righteousness]]: whereas they see, in one [[man]], and one day,
and one house, different things to be fit for different members, and
a thing formerly lawful, after a [[certain]] [[time]] not so; in one corner
permitted or commanded, but in another rightly forbidden and punished.
is [[justice]] therefore various or mutable? no, but the times [[time]], over which
it presides, flow not evenly, because they are times [[time]]. but [[men]] whose days
are few upon the [[earth]], for that by their senses they cannot harmonise
the causes of things in former ages [[age]] and other nations, which they had
not [[experience]] of, with these which they have [[experience]] of, whereas in
one and the same [[body]], day, or [[family]], they easily see what is fitting
for each member, and season, part, and [[person]]; to the one they take
exceptions, to the other they submit.

these things i then knew not, nor observed; they struck my sight on all
sides, and i saw them not. i indited verses, in which i might not place
every foot every where, but differently in different metres; nor even in
any one metre the self-same foot in all places. yet the art [[arts]] itself, by
which i indited, had not different principles [[principle]] for these different cases,
but comprised all in one. still i saw not how that [[righteousness]], which
good and holy [[men]] obeyed, did far more excellently and sublimely contain
in one all those things which [[god]] commanded, and in no part varied;
although in varying times [[time]] it prescribed not every thing at once, but
apportioned and enjoined what was fit for each. and i in my blindness,
censured the holy fathers [[father]], not only wherein they made use of things
present as [[god]] commanded and inspired them, but also wherein they were
foretelling things to come, as [[god]] was revealing in them.

can it at any [[time]] or place be [[unjust]] to [[love]] [[god]] with all his [[heart]],
with all his [[soul]], and with all his [[mind]]; and his neighbour as himself?
therefore are those foul offences which be against [[nature]], to be every
where and at all times [[time]] detested and punished; such as were those of the
men of sodom: which should all nations commit, they should all stand
guilty of the same crime, by the [[law]] of [[god]], which hath not so made men
that they should so [[abuse]] one another. for even that intercourse which
should be between [[god]] and us is violated, when that same [[nature]], of
which he is author, is polluted by perversity of [[lust]]. but those
actions which are offences against the customs of [[men]], are to be avoided
according to the customs severally prevailing; so that a thing agreed
upon, and confirmed, by custom or [[law]] of any [[city]] or nation, may not be
violated at the lawless [[pleasure]] of any, whether native or foreigner.
for any part which harmoniseth not with its whole, is offensive. but
when [[god]] commands a thing to be done, against the customs or compact of
any [[people]], though it were never by them done heretofore, it is to be
done; and if intermitted, it is to be restored; and if never ordained,
is now to be ordained. for lawful if it be for a [[king]], in the state
which he reigns over, to command that which no one before him, nor he
himself heretofore, had commanded, and to obey him cannot be against the
common weal of the [[state]] (nay, it were against it if he were not obeyed,
for to obey princes [[prince]] is a general compact of [[human]] society); how much
more unhesitatingly ought we to obey [[god]], in all which he commands, the
ruler of all his creatures! for as among the powers [[power]] in man's [[man]] [[society]],
the greater [[authority]] is obeyed in preference to the lesser, so must god
above all.

so in acts of [[violence]], where there is a [[wish]] to hurt, whether by
reproach or injury; and these either for [[revenge]], as one [[enemy]] against
another; or for some [[profit]] belonging to another, as the robber to
the traveller; or to avoid some [[evil]], as towards one who is feared; or
through envy, as one less fortunate to one more so, or one well thriven
in any thing, to him whose being on a par with himself he fears [[fear]], or
grieves at, or for the mere [[pleasure]] at another's [[pain]], as spectators
of gladiators, or deriders and mockers of others. these be the heads
of [[iniquity]] which spring from the [[lust]] of the flesh, of the eye, or of
rule, either singly, or two combined, or all together; and so do men
live ill against the three, and seven, that psaltery of of ten strings,
thy ten commandments, o [[god]], most high, and most sweet. but what foul
offences can there be against thee, who canst not be defiled? or
what acts of [[violence]] against thee, who canst not be harmed? but thou
avengest what [[men]] commit against themselves, seeing also when they sin
against thee, they do wickedly against their own souls [[soul]], and iniquity
gives itself the [[lie]], by corrupting and perverting their [[nature]], which
thou hast created and ordained, or by an immoderate use of things
allowed, or in burning in things unallowed, to that use which is against
nature; or are found guilty, raging with [[heart]] and tongue against thee,
kicking against the pricks; or when, bursting the pale of [[human]] [[society]],
they boldly joy in self-willed combinations or divisions, according as
they have any object to gain or [[subject]] of offence. and these things are
done when thou art [[arts]] forsaken, o fountain of [[life]], who art [[arts]] the only and
true creator and governor of the [[universe]], and by a self-willed [[pride]],
any one false thing is selected therefrom and loved. so then by a
humble devoutness we return to thee; and thou cleansest us from our
evil habits, and art [[arts]] merciful to their sins [[sin]] who confess, and hearest the
groaning of the [[prisoner]], and loosest us from the chains which we made
for ourselves, if we lift not up against thee the horns of an unreal
liberty, suffering the loss of all, through covetousness of more, by
loving more our own private [[good]] than thee, the [[good]] of all.

amidst these offences of foulness and [[violence]], and so many iniquities,
are sins [[sin]] of [[men]], who are on the whole making proficiency; which by those
that [[judge]] rightly, are, after the [[rule]] of [[perfection]], discommended, yet
the persons [[person]] commended, upon [[hope]] of future fruit, as in the green blade
of growing corn. and there are some, resembling offences of foulness or
violence, which yet are no sins [[sin]]; because they offend neither thee, our
lord [[god]], nor [[human]] [[society]]; when, namely, things fitting for a given
period are obtained for the service of [[life]], and we [[know]] not whether out
of a [[lust]] of having; or when things are, for the sake of correction, by
constituted [[authority]] punished, and we [[know]] not whether out of a [[lust]] of
hurting. many an action then which in men's sight is disapproved, is
by thy testimony approved; and many, by [[men]] praised, are (thou being
witness) condemned: because the show of the action, and the [[mind]] of the
doer, and the unknown exigency of the period, severally vary. but when
thou on a sudden commandest an unwonted and unthought of thing, yea,
although thou hast sometime forbidden it, and still for the [[time]] hidest
the [[reason]] of thy command, and it be against the ordinance of some
society of [[men]], who doubts [[doubt]] but it is to be done, seeing that society
of [[men]] is just which serves thee? but blessed are they who [[know]] thy
commands! for all things were done by thy servants; either to show forth
something needful for the [[present]], or to foreshow things to come.

these things i being ignorant of, scoffed at those thy holy servants and
prophets. and what gained i by scoffing at them, but to be scoffed at by
thee, being insensibly and step by step drawn on to those follies, as
to [[believe]] that a fig-tree wept when it was plucked, and the tree, its
mother, shed milky tears? which fig notwithstanding (plucked by some
other's, not his own, guilt) had some manichaean saint eaten, and
mingled with his bowels, he should breathe out of it angels, yea, there
shall burst forth particles of divinity, at every moan or groan in his
prayer, which particles of the most high and true [[god]] had remained bound
in that fig, unless they had been set at [[liberty]] by the teeth or belly
of some "elect" saint! and i, miserable, believed that more [[mercy]] was
to be shown to the fruits of the [[earth]] than [[men]], for whom they were
created. for if any one an hungered, not a manichaean, should ask for
any, that morsel would seem as it were condemned to [[capital]] [[punishment]],
which should be given him.

and thou sentest thine hand from above, and drewest my [[soul]] out of that
profound darkness, my [[mother]], thy faithful one, weeping to thee for me,
more than mothers [[mother]] weep the bodily deaths [[death]] of their [[children]]. for she,
by that [[faith]] and spirit which she had from thee, discerned the death
wherein i lay, and thou heardest her, o [[lord]]; thou heardest her, and
despisedst not her tears, when streaming down, they watered the ground
under her [[eyes]] in every place where she prayed; yea thou heardest her.
for whence was that [[dream]] whereby thou comfortedst her; so that she
allowed me to [[live]] with her, and to [[eat]] at the same table in the
house, which she had begun to shrink from, abhorring and detesting
the blasphemies of my error? for she saw herself standing on a certain
wooden [[rule]], and a shining [[youth]] coming towards her, cheerful and
smiling upon her, herself grieving, and overwhelmed with [[grief]]. but he
having (in order to instruct, as is their wont not to be instructed)
enquired of her the causes of her [[grief]] and daily tears, and she
answering that she was bewailing my perdition, he bade her rest
contented, and told her to look and observe, "that where she was, there
was i also." and when she looked, she saw me standing by her in the same
rule. whence was this, but that thine ears were towards her [[heart]]? o
thou [[good]] omnipotent, who so carest for every one of us, as if thou
caredst for him only; and so for all, as if they were but one!

whence was this also, that when she had told me this vision, and i would
fain bend it to mean, "that she rather should not despair of being one
day what i was"; she presently, without any hesitation, replies: "no;
for it was not told me that, 'where he, there thou also'; but 'where
thou, there he also'?" i confess to thee, o [[lord]], that to the [[best]] of my
remembrance (and i have oft spoken of this), that thy [[answer]], through
my waking [[mother]],--that she was not perplexed by the plausibility of my
false interpretation, and so quickly saw what was to be seen, and which
i certainly had not perceived before she spake,--even then moved me more
than the [[dream]] itself, by which a joy to the holy woman, to be fulfilled
so long after, was, for the consolation of her [[present]] anguish, so long
before foresignified. for almost nine years passed, in which i wallowed
in the mire of that deep pit, and the darkness of falsehood, often
assaying to rise, but dashed down the more grievously. all which time
that chaste, godly, and sober widow (such as thou lovest), now more
cheered with [[hope]], yet no whit relaxing in her weeping and mourning,
ceased not at all hours of her devotions to bewail my case unto thee.
and her prayers entered into thy presence; and yet thou sufferedst me to
be yet involved and reinvolved in that darkness.

thou gavest her meantime another [[answer]], which i call to [[mind]]; for much
i pass by, hasting to those things which more press me to confess unto
thee, and much i do not [[remember]]. thou gavest her then another [[answer]],
by a [[priest]] of thine, a [[certain]] bishop brought up in thy [[church]],
and well [[studied]] in thy books [[book]]. whom when this woman had entreated to
vouchsafe to converse with me, refute my errors, unteach me ill things,
and [[teach]] me [[good]] things (for this he was wont to do, when he found
persons fitted to receive it), he refused, wisely, as i afterwards
perceived. for he answered, that i was yet unteachable, being puffed
up with the novelty of that heresy, and had already perplexed divers
unskilful persons [[person]] with captious questions [[question]], as she had told him: "but
let him alone a while" (saith he), "only [[pray]] [[god]] for him, he will of
himself by reading find what that error is, and how [[great]] its impiety."
at the same [[time]] he told her, how himself, when a little one, had by his
seduced [[mother]] been consigned over to the manichees, and had not
only [[read]], but frequently copied out almost all, their books [[book]], and had
(without any argument or proof from any one) seen how much that sect was
to be avoided; and had avoided it. which when he had said, and she would
not be satisfied, but urged him more, with entreaties and many tears,
that he would see me and discourse with me; he, a little displeased at
her importunity, saith, "go thy ways and [[god]] bless thee, for it is not
possible that the [[son]] of these tears should perish." which [[answer]] she
took (as she often mentioned in her conversations with me) as if it had
sounded from [[heaven]].




book iv


for this space of nine years (from my nineteenth year to my
eight-and-twentieth) we lived seduced and seducing, deceived and
deceiving, in divers lusts; openly, by sciences [[science]] which they call liberal;
secretly, with a false-named [[religion]]; here proud, there [[superstitious]],
every where [[vain]]. here, hunting after the emptiness of popular [[praise]],
down even to theatrical applauses, and poetic prizes, and strifes for
grassy garlands, and the follies of shows, and the intemperance of
desires. there, desiring to be cleansed from these defilements, by
carrying food to those who were called "elect" and "holy," out of which,
in the workhouse of their stomachs, they should forge for us angels
and gods, by whom we might be cleansed. these things did i [[follow]], and
practise with my [[friends]], deceived by me, and with me. let the arrogant
mock me, and such as have not been, to their soul's health, stricken and
cast down by thee, o my [[god]]; but i would still confess to thee mine own
shame in thy [[praise]]. suffer me, i beseech thee, and give me grace to go
over in my [[present]] remembrance the wanderings of my forepassed [[time]],
and to offer unto thee the [[sacrifice]] of thanksgiving. for what am i to
myself without thee, but a guide to mine own downfall? or what am i even
at the [[best]], but an infant sucking the milk thou givest, and feeding
upon thee, the food that perisheth not? but what sort of [[man]] is any [[man]],
seeing he is but a [[man]]? let now the [[strong]] and the mighty laugh at us,
but let us [[poor]] and needy confess unto thee.

in those years i taught rhetoric, and, overcome by cupidity, made sale
of a loquacity to overcome by. yet i preferred (lord, thou knowest)
honest scholars (as they are accounted), and these i, without artifice,
taught artifices, not to be practised against the [[life]] of the guiltless,
though sometimes for the [[life]] of the guilty. and thou, o [[god]], from afar
perceivedst me stumbling in that slippery course, and amid much smoke
sending out some sparks of faithfulness, which i showed in that my
guidance of such as loved vanity, and sought after leasing, myself their
companion. in those years i had one,--not in that which is called
lawful [[marriage]], but whom i had found out in a wayward passion, void of
understanding; yet but one, remaining faithful even to her; in whom i
in my own case experienced what difference there is betwixt the
self-restraint of the marriage-covenant, for the sake of issue, and
the bargain of a lustful [[love]], where [[children]] are born against their
parents' will, although, once born, they constrain [[love]].

i [[remember]] also, that when i had settled to enter the lists for a
theatrical prize, some wizard [[asked]] me what i would give him to [[win]]; but
i, detesting and abhorring such foul mysteries, answered, "though the
garland were of imperishable gold, i would not suffer a fly to be
killed to gain me it." for he was to kill some living creatures in his
sacrifices, and by those honours [[honour]] to invite the devils [[devil]] to favour me. but
this ill also i rejected, not out of a pure [[love]] for thee, o [[god]] of my
heart; for i knew not how to [[love]] thee, who knew not how to conceive
aught beyond a material brightness. and doth not a [[soul]], sighing after
such fictions, commit fornication against thee, trust in things unreal,
and feed the wind? still i would not forsooth have sacrifices [[sacrifice]] offered
to devils [[devil]] for me, to whom i was sacrificing myself by that superstition.
for what else is it to feed the wind, but to feed them, that is by going
astray to become their [[pleasure]] and derision?

those impostors then, whom they style mathematicians, i consulted
without scruple; because they seemed to use no [[sacrifice]], nor to [[pray]] to
any spirit for their divinations: which art [[arts]], however, [[christian]] and
true piety consistently rejects and condemns. for, it is a [[good]] thing to
confess unto thee, and to say, have [[mercy]] upon me, heal my [[soul]], for i
have sinned against thee; and not to [[abuse]] thy [[mercy]] for a licence to
sin, but to [[remember]] the lord's words, behold, thou art [[arts]] made whole, sin
no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. all which wholesome advice
they [[labour]] to [[destroy]], saying, "the cause of thy [[sin]] is inevitably
determined in heaven"; and "this did [[venus]], or saturn, or mars":
that [[man]], forsooth, flesh and [[blood]], and proud [[corruption]], might be
blameless; while the creator and ordainer of [[heaven]] and the stars is
to bear the blame. and who is he but our [[god]]? the very sweetness and
well-spring of [[righteousness]], who renderest to every [[man]] according to
his works [[work]]: and a broken and contrite [[heart]] wilt thou not despise.

there was in those days a [[wise]] [[man]], very skilful in physic, and renowned
therein, who had with his own proconsular hand put the agonistic garland
upon my distempered head, but not as a physician: for this disease thou
only curest, who resistest the proud, and givest grace to the humble.
but didst thou fail me even by that old [[man]], or forbear to heal my [[soul]]?
for having become more acquainted with him, and hanging assiduously and
fixedly on his [[speech]] (for though in simple terms, it was vivid, lively,
and earnest), when he had gathered by my discourse that i was given to
the books [[book]] of nativity-casters, he kindly and fatherly advised me to cast
them away, and not fruitlessly bestow a [[care]] and diligence, necessary
for useful things, upon these vanities; saying, that he had in his
earliest years [[studied]] that art [[arts]], so as to make it the profession whereby
he should [[live]], and that, understanding hippocrates, he could soon have
understood such a study as this; and yet he had given it over, and taken
to physic, for no other [[reason]] but that he found it utterly false;
and he, a grave [[man]], would not get his living by deluding [[people]]. "but
thou," saith he, "hast rhetoric to maintain thyself by, so that thou
followest this of [[free]] [[choice]], not of necessity: the more then oughtest
thou to give me credit herein, who laboured to acquire it so perfectly
as to get my living by it alone." of whom when i had demanded, how then
could many true things be foretold by it, he answered me (as he could)
"that the [[force]] of [[chance]], diffused throughout the whole order of
things, brought this about. for if when a [[man]] by haphazard opens the
pages of some poet, who sang and [[thought]] of something wholly different,
a verse oftentimes fell out, wondrously agreeable to the present
business: it were not to be wondered at, if out of the [[soul]] of [[man]],
unconscious what takes place in it, by some higher instinct an answer
should be given, by hap, not by art [[arts]], corresponding to the [[business]] and
actions of the demander."

and thus much, either from or through him, thou conveyedst to me, and
tracedst in my memory, what i might hereafter examine for myself. but at
that [[time]] neither he, nor my dearest nebridius, a [[youth]] singularly good
and of a holy [[fear]], who derided the whole [[body]] of divination, could
persuade me to cast it aside, the [[authority]] of the authors swaying me
yet more, and as yet i had found no [[certain]] proof (such as i sought)
whereby it might without all [[doubt]] appear, that what had been truly
foretold by those consulted was the result of haphazard, not of the art
of the star-gazers.

in those years when i first began to [[teach]] rhetoric in my native town,
i had made one my friend, but too dear to me, from a [[community]] of
pursuits, of mine own [[age]], and, as myself, in the first opening flower
of [[youth]]. he had grown up of a child with me, and we had been both
school-fellows and play-fellows. but he was not yet my friend as
afterwards, nor even then, as true [[friendship]] is; for true it cannot be,
unless in such as thou cementest together, cleaving unto thee, by that
love which is shed abroad in our hearts [[heart]] by the holy ghost, which is
given unto us. yet was it but too sweet, ripened by the warmth of
kindred studies: for, from the true [[faith]] (which he as a [[youth]] had
not soundly and thoroughly imbibed), i had warped him also to those
superstitious and pernicious fables, for which my [[mother]] bewailed me.
with me he now erred in [[mind]], nor could my [[soul]] be without him. but
behold thou wert close on the steps of thy fugitives, at once [[god]] of
vengeance, and fountain of mercies, turning us to thyself by wonderful
means; thou tookest that [[man]] out of this [[life]], when he had scarce filled
up one whole year of my [[friendship]], sweet to me above all sweetness of
that my [[life]].

who can recount all thy praises [[praise]], which he hath [[felt]] in his one [[self]]?
what diddest thou then, my [[god]], and how unsearchable is the abyss of
thy judgments [[judgment]]? for long, sore sick of a fever, he lay senseless in
a death-sweat; and his recovery being despaired of, he was baptised,
unknowing; myself meanwhile little regarding, and presuming that his
soul would retain rather what it had received of me, not what was
wrought on his unconscious [[body]]. but it proved far otherwise: for he was
refreshed, and restored. forthwith, as soon as i could speak with him
(and i could, so soon as he was able, for i never left him, and we hung
but too much upon each other), i essayed to jest with him, as though he
would jest with me at that baptism which he had received, when utterly
absent in [[mind]] and feeling, but had now understood that he had received.
but he so shrunk from me, as from an [[enemy]]; and with a wonderful and
sudden [[freedom]] bade me, as i would continue his friend, forbear such
language to him. i, all astonished and amazed, suppressed all my
emotions till he should grow well, and his health were [[strong]] enough for
me to deal with him as i would. but he was taken away from my frenzy,
that with thee he might be preserved for my comfort; a few days after in
my absence, he was attacked again by the fever, and so departed.

at this [[grief]] my [[heart]] was utterly darkened; and whatever i beheld was
death. my native [[country]] was a torment to me, and my father's house a
strange unhappiness; and whatever i had shared with him, wanting him,
became a distracting torture. mine [[eyes]] sought him every where, but he
was not granted them; and i hated all places, for that they had not him;
nor could they now tell me, "he is coming," as when he was alive and
absent. i became a [[great]] riddle to myself, and i [[asked]] my [[soul]], why she
was so [[sad]], and why she disquieted me sorely: but she knew not what to
answer me. and if i said, trust in [[god]], she very rightly obeyed me not;
because that most dear friend, whom she had lost, was, being [[man]], both
truer and [[better]] than that phantasm she was bid to trust in. only tears
were sweet to me, for they succeeded my friend, in the dearest of my
affections.

and now, [[lord]], these things are passed by, and [[time]] hath assuaged my
wound. may i learn from thee, who art [[arts]] [[truth]], and approach the ear of my
heart unto thy mouth, that thou mayest tell me why weeping is sweet to
the miserable? hast thou, although [[present]] every where, cast away our
misery far from thee? and thou abidest in thyself, but we are tossed
about in divers trials. and yet unless we mourned in thine ears, we
should have no [[hope]] left. whence then is sweet fruit gathered from the
bitterness of [[life]], from groaning, tears, sighs, and complaints? doth
this sweeten it, that we [[hope]] thou hearest? this is true of prayer, for
therein is a longing to approach unto thee. but is it also in [[grief]] for
a thing lost, and the [[sorrow]] wherewith i was then overwhelmed? for i
neither hoped he should return to [[life]] nor did i [[desire]] this with my
tears; but i wept only and [[grieved]]. for i was miserable, and had lost my
joy. or is weeping indeed a bitter thing, and for very loathing of the
things which we before enjoyed, does it then, when we shrink from them,
please us?

but what speak i of these things? for now is no [[time]] to [[question]], but to
confess unto thee. wretched i was; and wretched is every [[soul]] bound by
the [[friendship]] of perishable things; he is torn asunder when he loses
them, and then he feels [[feel]] the wretchedness which he had ere yet he lost
them. so was it then with me; i wept most bitterly, and found my repose
in bitterness. thus was i wretched, and that wretched [[life]] i held dearer
than my friend. for though i would willingly have changed it, yet was i
more unwilling to part with it than with him; yea, i [[know]] not whether i
would have parted with it even for him, as is related (if not feigned)
of pylades and orestes, that they would gladly have died for each other
or together, not to [[live]] together being to them worse than [[death]]. but in
me there had arisen some unexplained feeling, too contrary to this, for
at once i loathed exceedingly to [[live]] and feared to [[die]]. i suppose, the
more i loved him, the more did i hate, and [[fear]] (as a most cruel enemy)
death, which had bereaved me of him: and i imagined it would speedily
make an end of all [[men]], since it had [[power]] over him. thus was it with
me, i [[remember]]. behold my [[heart]], o my [[god]], behold and see into me; for
well i [[remember]] it, o my [[hope]], who cleansest me from the impurity of
such affections, directing mine [[eyes]] towards thee, and plucking my feet
out of the snare. for i wondered that others, [[subject]] to [[death]], did
live, since he whom i loved, as if he should never [[die]], was [[dead]]; and i
wondered yet more that myself, who was to him a second [[self]], could [[live]],
he being [[dead]]. well said one of his friend, "thou half of my soul";
for i [[felt]] that my [[soul]] and his [[soul]] were "one [[soul]] in two bodies": and
therefore was my [[life]] a [[horror]] to me, because i would not [[live]] halved.
and therefore perchance i feared to [[die]], lest he whom i had much loved
should [[die]] wholly.

o madness, which knowest not how to [[love]] [[men]], like men! o foolish man
that i then was, enduring impatiently the lot of man! i fretted then,
sighed, wept, was distracted; had neither rest nor counsel. for i bore
about a shattered and bleeding [[soul]], impatient of being borne by me, yet
where to repose it, i found not. not in calm groves, not in games and
music, nor in fragrant spots, nor in [[curious]] banquetings, nor in the
pleasures of the bed and the couch; nor (finally) in books [[book]] or poesy,
found it repose. all things looked ghastly, yea, the very [[light]];
whatsoever was not what he was, was revolting and hateful, except
groaning and tears. for in those alone found i a little refreshment. but
when my [[soul]] was withdrawn from them a huge load of misery weighed
me down. to thee, o [[lord]], it ought to have been raised, for thee to
lighten; i knew it; but neither could nor would; the more, since, when i
thought of thee, thou wert not to me any solid or substantial thing. for
thou wert not thyself, but a mere phantom, and my error was my [[god]]. if
i offered to discharge my load thereon, that it might rest, it glided
through the void, and came rushing down again on me; and i had remained
to myself a hapless spot, where i could neither be, nor be from thence.
for whither should my [[heart]] flee from my [[heart]]? whither should i
flee from myself? whither not [[follow]] myself? and yet i fled out of my
country; for so should mine [[eyes]] less look for him, where they were not
wont to see him. and thus from thagaste, i came to [[carthage]].

times lose no [[time]]; nor do they roll idly by; through our senses they
work [[strange]] operations on the [[mind]]. behold, they went and came day by
day, and by coming and going, introduced into my [[mind]] other imaginations
and other remembrances; and little by little patched me up again with my
old [[kind]] of delights, unto which that my [[sorrow]] gave way. and yet there
succeeded, not indeed other griefs, yet the causes of other griefs. for
whence had that former [[grief]] so easily reached my very inmost [[soul]], but
that i had poured out my [[soul]] upon the dust, in loving one that must
die, as if he would never [[die]]? for what restored and refreshed me
chiefly was the solaces of other [[friends]], with whom i did [[love]], what
instead of thee i loved; and this was a [[great]] fable, and protracted [[lie]],
by whose adulterous stimulus, our [[soul]], which lay itching in our ears,
was being defiled. but that fable would not [[die]] to me, so oft as any of
my [[friends]] died. there were other things which in them did more take my
mind; to talk and jest together, to do [[kind]] offices by turns; to read
together honied books [[book]]; to play the [[fool]] or be earnest together; to
dissent at times [[time]] without discontent, as a [[man]] might with his own [[self]];
and even with the seldomness of these dissentings, to season our more
frequent consentings; sometimes to [[teach]], and sometimes learn; long for
the absent with [[impatience]]; and welcome the coming with joy. these and
the like expressions, proceeding out of the hearts [[heart]] of those that loved
and were loved again, by the countenance, the tongue, the [[eyes]], and
a thousand pleasing gestures, were so much fuel to melt our souls
together, and out of many make but one.

this is it that is loved in [[friends]]; and so loved, that a man's
conscience condemns itself, if he [[love]] not him that loves [[love]] him again, or
love not again him that loves [[love]] him, looking for nothing from his person
but indications of his [[love]]. hence that mourning, if one [[die]], and
darkenings of sorrows [[sorrow]], that steeping of the [[heart]] in tears, all
sweetness turned to bitterness; and upon the loss of [[life]] of the dying,
the [[death]] of the living. blessed whoso loveth thee, and his friend in
thee, and his [[enemy]] for thee. for he alone loses none dear to him, to
whom all are dear in him who cannot be lost. and who is this but our
god, the [[god]] that made [[heaven]] and [[earth]], and filleth them, because by
filling them he created them? thee none loseth, but who leaveth. and
who leaveth thee, whither goeth or whither fleeth he, but from thee
well-pleased, to thee displeased? for where doth he not find thy [[law]] in
his own [[punishment]]? and thy [[law]] is [[truth]], and [[truth]] thou.

turn us, o [[god]] of hosts, show us thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
for whithersoever the [[soul]] of [[man]] turns itself, unless toward thee, it
is riveted upon sorrows [[sorrow]], yea though it is riveted on things beautiful.
and yet they, out of thee, and out of the [[soul]], were not, unless they
were from thee. they rise, and set; and by rising, they begin as it were
to be; they grow, that they may be perfected; and perfected, they wax
old and wither; and all grow not old, but all wither. so then when they
rise and tend to be, the more quickly they grow that they may be, so
much the more they haste not to be. this is the [[law]] of them. thus much
has thou allotted them, because they are portions of things, which
exist not all at once, but by passing away and succeeding, they together
complete that [[universe]], whereof they are portions. and even thus is our
speech completed by signs giving forth a sound: but this again is not
perfected unless one word pass away when it hath sounded its part, that
another may succeed. out of all these things let my [[soul]] [[praise]] thee,
o [[god]], creator of all; yet let not my [[soul]] be riveted unto these things
with the glue of [[love]], through the senses of the [[body]]. for they go
whither they were to go, that they might not be; and they rend her with
pestilent longings, because she longs to be, yet loves [[love]] to repose in what
she loves [[love]]. but in these things is no place of repose; they abide not,
they flee; and who can [[follow]] them with the senses of the flesh? yea,
who can grasp them, when they are hard by? for the sense of the flesh is
slow, because it is the sense of the flesh; and thereby is it bounded.
it sufficeth for that it was made for; but it sufficeth not to stay
things running their course from their appointed starting-place to the
end appointed. for in thy word, by which they are created, they hear
their decree, "hence and hitherto."

be not foolish, o my [[soul]], nor become deaf in the ear of thine heart
with the tumult of thy folly. hearken thou too.

the word itself calleth thee to return: and there is the place of rest
imperturbable, where [[love]] is not forsaken, if itself forsaketh not.
behold, these things pass away, that others may replace them, and so
this lower [[universe]] be completed by all his parts. but do i depart any
whither? saith the word of [[god]]. there fix thy dwelling, trust there
whatsoever thou hast thence, o my [[soul]], at least now thou art [[arts]] tired out
with vanities. entrust [[truth]], whatsoever thou hast from the [[truth]], and
thou shalt lose nothing; and thy decay shall bloom again, and all thy
diseases be healed, and thy mortal parts be reformed and renewed, and
bound around thee: nor shall they lay thee whither themselves descend;
but they shall stand fast with thee, and abide for ever before [[god]], who
abideth and standeth fast for ever.

why then be perverted and [[follow]] thy flesh? be it converted and follow
thee. whatever by her thou hast sense of, is in part; and the whole,
whereof these are parts, thou knowest not; and yet they delight thee.
but had the sense of thy flesh a capacity for comprehending the whole,
and not itself also, for thy [[punishment]], been justly restricted to
a part of the whole, thou wouldest, that whatsoever existeth at this
present, should pass away, that so the whole might [[better]] please thee.
for what we speak also, by the same sense of the flesh thou hearest; yet
wouldest not thou have the syllables stay, but fly away, that others may
come, and thou hear the whole. and so ever, when any one thing is made
up of many, all of which do not [[exist]] together, all collectively would
please more than they do severally, could all be perceived collectively.
but far [[better]] than these is he who made all; and he is our [[god]], nor
doth he pass away, for neither doth aught succeed him.

if bodies [[body]] please thee, [[praise]] [[god]] on [[occasion]] of them, and turn back
thy [[love]] upon their maker; lest in these things which please thee, thou
displease. if souls [[soul]] please thee, be they loved in [[god]]: for they too are
mutable, but in him are they firmly stablished; else would they pass,
and pass away. in him then be they beloved; and carry unto him along
with thee what souls [[soul]] thou canst, and say to them, "him let us [[love]], him
let us [[love]]: he made these, nor is he far off. for he did not make them,
and so depart, but they are of him, and in him. see there he is, where
truth is loved. he is within the very [[heart]], yet hath the [[heart]] strayed
from him. go back into your [[heart]], ye transgressors, and cleave fast to
him that made you. stand with him, and ye shall stand fast. rest in him,
and ye shall be at rest. whither go ye in rough ways? whither go ye?
the [[good]] that you [[love]] is from him; but it is [[good]] and pleasant through
reference to him, and justly shall it be embittered, because unjustly is
any thing loved which is from him, if he be forsaken for it. to what end
then would ye still and still walk these difficult and toilsome ways?
there is no rest, where ye seek it. seek what ye seek; but it is not
there where ye seek. ye seek a blessed [[life]] in the [[land]] of [[death]]; it is
not there. for how should there be a blessed [[life]] where [[life]] itself is
not?

"but our true [[life]] came down hither, and bore our [[death]], and slew him,
out of the abundance of his own [[life]]: and he thundered, calling aloud to
us to return hence to him into that secret place, whence he came forth
to us, first into the virgin's womb, wherein he espoused the human
creation, our mortal flesh, that it might not be for ever mortal, and
thence like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, rejoicing as a giant
to run his course. for he lingered not, but ran, calling aloud by words,
deeds, [[death]], [[life]], descent, ascension; crying aloud to us to return
unto him. and he departed from our [[eyes]], that we might return into our
heart, and there find him. for he departed, and lo, he is here. he would
not be long with us, yet left us not; for he departed thither, whence
he never parted, because the [[world]] was made by him. and in this world
he was, and into this [[world]] he came to save sinners, unto whom my soul
confesseth, and he healeth it, for it hath sinned against him. o ye sons
of [[men]], how long so slow of [[heart]]? even now, after the descent of life
to you, will ye not ascend and [[live]]? but whither ascend ye, when ye are
on high, and set your mouth against the heavens [[heaven]]? descend, that ye may
ascend, and ascend to [[god]]. for ye have fallen, by ascending against
him." tell them this, that they may weep in the valley of tears, and
so carry them up with thee unto [[god]]; because out of his spirit thou
speakest thus unto them, if thou speakest, burning with the [[fire]] of
charity.

these things i then knew not, and i loved these lower beauties [[beauty]], and i
was sinking to the very depths, and to my [[friends]] i said, "do we love
any thing but the beautiful? what then is the beautiful? and what is
beauty? what is it that attracts and wins us to the things we [[love]]? for
unless there were in them a grace and [[beauty]], they could by no
means draw us unto them." and i marked and perceived that in bodies
themselves, there was a [[beauty]], from their forming a sort of whole, and
again, another from apt and mutual correspondence, as of a part of
the [[body]] with its whole, or a shoe with a foot, and the like. and this
consideration sprang up in my [[mind]], out of my inmost [[heart]], and i wrote
"on the [[fair]] and fit," i [[think]], two or three books [[book]]. thou knowest, o
lord, for it is gone from me; for i have them not, but they are strayed
from me, i [[know]] not how.

but what moved me, o [[lord]] my [[god]], to dedicate these books [[book]] unto hierius,
an orator of [[rome]], whom i knew not by face, but loved for the fame
of his learning which was eminent in him, and some words of his i had
heard, which pleased me? but more did he please me, for that he pleased
others, who highly extolled him, amazed that out of a syrian, first
instructed in [[greek]] eloquence, should afterwards be formed a wonderful
latin orator, and one most learned in things pertaining unto [[philosophy]].
one is commended, and, unseen, he is loved: doth this [[love]] enter the
heart of the hearer from the mouth of the commender? not so. but by one
who loveth is another kindled. for hence he is loved who is commended,
when the commender is believed to extol him with an unfeigned [[heart]];
that is, when one that loves [[love]] him, praises [[praise]] him.

for so did i then [[love]] [[men]], upon the [[judgment]] of [[men]], not thine, o my
god, in whom no [[man]] is deceived. but yet why not for qualities, like
those of a famous charioteer, or fighter with beasts in the theatre,
known far and wide by a vulgar popularity, but far otherwise, and
earnestly, and so as i would be myself commended? for i would not be
commended or loved, as actors are (though i myself did commend and love
them), but had rather be unknown, than so known; and even hated, than
so loved. where now are the impulses to such various and divers kinds [[kind]] of
loves laid up in one [[soul]]? why, since we are equally [[men]], do i love
in another what, if i did not hate, i should not spurn and cast from
myself? for it holds not, that as a [[good]] horse is loved by him, who
would not, though he might, be that horse, therefore the same may be
said of an actor, who shares our [[nature]]. do i then [[love]] in a [[man]], what i
hate to be, who am a [[man]]? [[man]] himself is a [[great]] deep, whose very hairs
thou numberest, o [[lord]], and they fall not to the ground without thee.
and yet are the hairs of his head easier to be numbered than his
feelings, and the beatings of his [[heart]].

but that orator was of that sort whom i loved, as wishing to be myself
such; and i erred through a swelling [[pride]], and was tossed about with
every wind, but yet was steered by thee, though very secretly. and
whence do i [[know]], and whence do i confidently confess unto thee, that
i had loved him more for the [[love]] of his commenders, than for the very
things for which he was commended? because, had he been unpraised, and
these self-same [[men]] had dispraised him, and with dispraise and contempt
told the very same things of him, i had never been so kindled and
excited to [[love]] him. and yet the things had not been other, nor he
himself other; but only the feelings of the relators. see where the
impotent [[soul]] lies [[lie]] along, that is not yet stayed up by the solidity
of truth! just as the gales of tongues blow from the breast of the
opinionative, so is it carried this way and that, driven forward and
backward, and the [[light]] is overclouded to it, and the [[truth]] unseen. and
lo, it is before us. and it was to me a [[great]] matter, that my discourse
and labours [[labour]] should be known to that [[man]]: which should he approve, i were
the more kindled; but if he disapproved, my empty [[heart]], void of thy
solidity, had been wounded. and yet the "fair and fit," whereon i wrote
to him, i dwelt on with [[pleasure]], and surveyed it, and admired it,
though none joined therein.

but i saw not yet, whereon this weighty matter turned in thy [[wisdom]],
o thou omnipotent, who only doest wonders; and my [[mind]] ranged through
corporeal forms; and "fair," i defined and distinguished what is so
in itself, and "fit," whose [[beauty]] is in correspondence to some other
thing: and this i supported by corporeal examples [[example]]. and i turned to
the [[nature]] of the [[mind]], but the false notion which i had of spiritual
things, let me not see the [[truth]]. yet the [[force]] of [[truth]] did of itself
flash into mine [[eyes]], and i turned away my panting [[soul]] from incorporeal
substance to lineaments, and colours, and bulky magnitudes. and not
being able to see these in the [[mind]], i [[thought]] i could not see my [[mind]].
and whereas in [[virtue]] i loved [[peace]], and in viciousness i abhorred
discord; in the first i observed a unity, but in the other, a sort
of division. and in that unity i conceived the [[rational]] [[soul]], and the
nature of [[truth]] and of the [[chief]] [[good]] to consist; but in this division
i miserably imagined there to be some unknown substance of irrational
life, and the [[nature]] of the [[chief]] [[evil]], which should not only be a
substance, but real [[life]] also, and yet not derived from thee, o my [[god]],
of whom are all things. and yet that first i called a monad, as it had
been a [[soul]] without [[sex]]; but the latter a duad;--anger, in deeds of
violence, and in flagitiousness, [[lust]]; not knowing whereof i spake. for
i had not known or learned that neither was [[evil]] a substance, nor our
soul that [[chief]] and unchangeable [[good]].

for as deeds of [[violence]] arise, if that emotion of the [[soul]] be
corrupted, whence vehement action springs, stirring itself insolently
and unrulily; and lusts, when that affection of the [[soul]] is ungoverned,
whereby carnal pleasures [[pleasure]] are drunk in, so do errors and false opinions
defile the conversation, if the reasonable [[soul]] itself be corrupted; as
it was then in me, who knew not that it must be enlightened by another
light, that it may be partaker of [[truth]], seeing itself is not that
nature of [[truth]]. for thou shalt [[light]] my candle, o [[lord]] my [[god]], thou
shalt enlighten my darkness: and of thy fulness have we all received,
for thou art [[arts]] the true [[light]] that lighteth every [[man]] that cometh into the
world; for in thee there is no variableness, neither shadow of [[change]].

but i pressed towards thee, and was thrust from thee, that i might taste
of [[death]]: for thou resistest the proud. but what prouder, than for me
with a [[strange]] madness to maintain myself to be that by [[nature]] which
thou art [[arts]]? for whereas i was [[subject]] to [[change]] (so much being manifest
to me, my very [[desire]] to become [[wise]], being the [[wish]], of worse to become
better), yet chose i rather to imagine thee [[subject]] to [[change]], and
myself not to be that which thou art [[arts]]. therefore i was repelled by thee,
and thou resistedst my [[vain]] stiffneckedness, and i imagined corporeal
forms, and, myself flesh, i accused flesh; and, a wind that passeth
away, i returned not to thee, but i passed on and on to things which
have no being, neither in thee, nor in me, nor in the [[body]]. neither were
they created for me by thy [[truth]], but by my vanity devised out of
things corporeal. and i was wont to ask thy faithful little ones, my
fellow-citizens (from whom, unknown to myself, i stood exiled), i was
wont, prating and foolishly, to ask them, "why then doth the [[soul]] err
which [[god]] created?" but i would not be [[asked]], "why then doth god
err?" and i maintained that thy unchangeable substance did err upon
constraint, rather than confess that my changeable substance had gone
astray voluntarily, and now, in [[punishment]], lay in error.

i was then some six or seven and twenty years old when i wrote those
volumes; revolving within me corporeal fictions, buzzing in the ears
of my [[heart]], which i turned, o sweet [[truth]], to thy inward melody,
meditating on the "fair and fit," and longing to stand and hearken to
thee, and to rejoice greatly at the bridegroom's voice, but could not;
for by the voices of mine own errors, i was hurried abroad, and through
the weight of my own [[pride]], i was sinking into the lowest pit. for thou
didst not make me to hear joy and gladness, nor did the bones exult
which were not yet humbled.

and what did it [[profit]] me, that scarce twenty years old, a [[book]] of
aristotle, which they call the ten predicaments, falling into my hands
(on whose very name i hung, as on something [[great]] and [[divine]], so often
as my rhetoric master of [[carthage]], and others, accounted learned,
mouthed it with cheeks bursting with pride), i [[read]] and understood it
unaided? and on my conferring with others, who said that they scarcely
understood it with very able tutors, not only orally explaining it, but
drawing many things in sand, they could tell me no more of it than i had
learned, reading it by myself. and the [[book]] appeared to me to speak very
clearly of substances, such as "man," and of their qualities, as the
figure of a [[man]], of what sort it is; and stature, how many feet high;
and his relationship, whose [[brother]] he is; or where placed; or when
born; or whether he stands or sits; or be shod or armed; or does, or
suffers anything; and all the innumerable things which might be ranged
under these nine predicaments, of which i have given some specimens, or
under that [[chief]] predicament of substance.

what did all this further me, seeing it even hindered me? when,
imagining whatever was, was comprehended under those ten predicaments,
i essayed in such [[wise]] to [[understand]], o my [[god]], thy wonderful and
unchangeable unity also, as if thou also hadst been subjected to thine
own greatness or [[beauty]]; so that (as in bodies) they should [[exist]] in
thee, as their [[subject]]: whereas thou thyself art [[arts]] thy greatness and
beauty; but a [[body]] is not [[great]] or [[fair]] in that it is a [[body]], seeing
that, though it were less [[great]] or [[fair]], it should notwithstanding be
a [[body]]. but it was falsehood which of thee i conceived, not [[truth]],
fictions of my misery, not the realities of thy blessedness. for thou
hadst commanded, and it was done in me, that the [[earth]] should bring
forth briars and thorns to me, and that in the sweat of my brows i
should [[eat]] my bread.

and what did it [[profit]] me, that all the books [[book]] i could procure of the
so-called liberal [[arts]], i, the vile [[slave]] of vile affections, [[read]] by
myself, and understood? and i delighted in them, but knew not whence
came all, that therein was true or [[certain]]. for i had my back to the
light, and my face to the things enlightened; whence my face, with which
i discerned the things enlightened, itself was not enlightened.
whatever was written, either on rhetoric, or [[logic]], geometry, [[music]],
and arithmetic, by myself without much difficulty or any instructor,
i understood, thou knowest, o [[lord]] my [[god]]; because both quickness of
understanding, and acuteness in discerning, is thy gift: yet did i not
thence [[sacrifice]] to thee. so then it served not to my use, but rather
to my perdition, since i went about to get so [[good]] a portion of my
substance into my own keeping; and i kept not my [[strength]] for thee, but
wandered from thee into a far [[country]], to spend it upon harlotries. for
what profited me [[good]] abilities, not employed to [[good]] uses? for i felt
not that those [[arts]] were attained with [[great]] difficulty, even by the
studious and talented, until i attempted to explain them to such; when
he most excelled in them who followed me not altogether slowly.

but what did this further me, imagining that thou, o [[lord]] [[god]], the
truth, wert a vast and bright [[body]], and i a fragment of that [[body]]?
perverseness too great! but such was i. nor do i blush, o my [[god]], to
confess to thee thy mercies towards me, and to call upon thee, who
blushed not then to profess to [[men]] my blasphemies, and to bark against
thee. what profited me then my nimble wit in those sciences [[science]] and all
those most knotty volumes, unravelled by me, without aid from human
instruction; seeing i erred so foully, and with such sacrilegious
shamefulness, in the doctrine of piety? or what hindrance was a far
slower wit to thy little ones, since they departed not far from thee,
that in the nest of thy [[church]] they might securely be fledged, and
nourish the wings of charity, by the food of a sound [[faith]]. o [[lord]] our
god, under the shadow of thy wings let us [[hope]]; [[protect]] us, and carry
us. thou wilt carry us both when little, and even to hoar hairs wilt
thou carry us; for our firmness, when it is thou, then is it firmness;
but when our own, it is infirmity. our [[good]] ever lives [[life]] with thee;
from which when we turn away, we are turned aside. let us now, o [[lord]],
return, that we may not be overturned, because with thee our [[good]] lives
without any decay, which [[good]] art [[arts]] thou; nor need we [[fear]], lest there
be no place whither to return, because we fell from it: for through our
absence, our mansion fell not--thy eternity.




book v


accept the [[sacrifice]] of my confessions from the ministry of my tongue,
which thou hast formed and stirred up to confess unto thy name. heal
thou all my bones, and let them say, o [[lord]], who is like unto thee? for
he who confesses to thee doth not [[teach]] thee what takes place within
him; seeing a closed [[heart]] closes not out thy eye, nor can man's
hard-heartedness thrust back thy hand: for thou dissolvest it at thy
will in [[pity]] or in vengeance, and nothing can hide itself from thy heat.
but let my [[soul]] [[praise]] thee, that it may [[love]] thee; and let it confess
thy own mercies to thee, that it may [[praise]] thee. thy whole creation
ceaseth not, nor is silent in thy praises [[praise]]; neither the spirit of man
with voice directed unto thee, nor creation animate or inanimate, by the
voice of those who meditate thereon: that so our souls [[soul]] may from their
weariness arise towards thee, leaning on those things which thou hast
created, and passing on to thyself, who madest them wonderfully; and
there is refreshment and true [[strength]].

let the restless, the godless, depart and flee from thee; yet thou seest
them, and dividest the darkness. and behold, the [[universe]] with them is
fair, though they are foul. and how have they injured thee? or how have
they disgraced thy [[government]], which, from the [[heaven]] to this lowest
earth, is just and [[perfect]]? for whither fled they, when they fled from
thy presence? or where dost not thou find them? but they fled, that they
might not see thee seeing them, and, blinded, might stumble against thee
(because thou forsakest nothing thou hast made); that the [[unjust]], i say,
might stumble upon thee, and justly be hurt; withdrawing themselves from
thy gentleness, and stumbling at thy uprightness, and falling upon their
own ruggedness. ignorant, in [[truth]], that thou art [[arts]] every where, whom no
place encompasseth! and thou alone art [[arts]] near, even to those that remove
far from thee. let them then be turned, and seek thee; because not as
they have forsaken their creator, hast thou forsaken thy creation. let
them be turned and seek thee; and behold, thou art [[arts]] there in their [[heart]],
in the [[heart]] of those that confess to thee, and cast themselves upon
thee, and weep in thy bosom, after all their rugged ways. then dost
thou gently wipe away their tears, and they weep the more, and joy
in weeping; even for that thou, [[lord]],--not [[man]] of flesh and [[blood]],
but--thou, [[lord]], who madest them, re-makest and comfortest them. but
where was i, when i was seeking thee? and thou wert before me, but i had
gone away from thee; nor did i find myself, how much less thee!

i would lay open before my [[god]] that nine-and-twentieth year of mine
age. there had then come to [[carthage]] a [[certain]] bishop of the manichees,
faustus by name, a [[great]] snare of the [[devil]], and many were entangled
by him through that lure of his smooth [[language]]: which though i did
commend, yet could i separate from the [[truth]] of the things which i was
earnest to learn: nor did i so much regard the service of oratory as the
science which this faustus, so praised among them, set before me to
feed upon. fame had before bespoken him most knowing in all valuable
learning, and exquisitely skilled in the liberal sciences [[science]]. and since i
had [[read]] and well remembered much of the [[philosophers]], i compared some
things of theirs with those long fables of the manichees, and found the
former the more probable; even although they could only prevail so far
as to make [[judgment]] of this lower [[world]], the [[lord]] of it they could by
no means find out. for thou art [[arts]] [[great]], o [[lord]], and hast [[respect]] unto the
humble, but the proud thou beholdest afar off. nor dost thou draw near,
but to the contrite in [[heart]], nor art [[arts]] found by the proud, no, not though
by [[curious]] [[skill]] they could number the stars and the sand, and measure
the starry heavens [[heaven]], and track the courses of the planets.

for with their understanding and wit, which thou bestowedst on them,
they search out these things; and much have they found out; and
foretold, many years before, eclipses of those luminaries, the sun
and moon,--what day and hour, and how many digits,--nor did their
calculation fail; and it came to pass as they foretold; and they wrote
down the rules [[rule]] they had found out, and these are [[read]] at this day, and
out of them do others foretell in what year and month of the year, and
what day of the month, and what hour of the day, and what part of its
light, moon or sun is to be eclipsed, and so it shall be, as it is
foreshowed. at these things [[men]], that [[know]] not this art [[arts]], marvel and are
astonished, and they that [[know]] it, exult, and are puffed up; and by
an ungodly [[pride]] departing from thee, and failing of thy [[light]], they
foresee a failure of the sun's [[light]], which shall be, so long before,
but see not their own, which is. for they search not religiously whence
they have the wit, wherewith they search out this. and finding that thou
madest them, they give not themselves up to thee, to preserve what thou
madest, nor [[sacrifice]] to thee what they have made themselves; nor slay
their own soaring imaginations [[imagination]], as fowls of the air, nor their own
diving curiosities (wherewith, like the fishes of the sea, they wander
over the unknown paths of the abyss), nor their own luxuriousness, as
beasts of the field, that thou, [[lord]], a consuming [[fire]], mayest burn up
those [[dead]] cares [[care]] of theirs, and re-create themselves immortally.

but they knew not the way, thy word, by whom thou madest these things
which they number, and themselves who number, and the sense whereby
they perceive what they number, and the understanding, out of which they
number; or that of thy [[wisdom]] there is no number. but the only begotten
is himself made unto us [[wisdom]], and [[righteousness]], and sanctification,
and was numbered among us, and paid tribute unto caesar. they knew not
this way whereby to descend to him from themselves, and by him ascend
unto him. they knew not this way, and deemed themselves exalted amongst
the stars and shining; and behold, they fell upon the [[earth]], and their
foolish [[heart]] was darkened. they discourse many things truly concerning
the creature; but [[truth]], artificer of the creature, they seek not
piously, and therefore find him not; or if they find him, knowing him
to be [[god]], they glorify him not as [[god]], neither are thankful, but
become [[vain]] in their imaginations [[imagination]], and profess themselves to be [[wise]],
attributing to themselves what is thine; and thereby with most perverse
blindness, study to impute to thee what is their own, forging lies [[lie]] of
thee who art [[arts]] the [[truth]], and changing the [[glory]] of uncorruptible god
into an image made like corruptible [[man]], and to birds, and four-footed
beasts, and creeping things, changing thy [[truth]] into a [[lie]], and
worshipping and serving the creature more than the creator.

yet many truths [[truth]] concerning the creature retained i from these [[men]], and
saw the [[reason]] thereof from calculations, the succession of times [[time]], and
the visible testimonies of the stars; and compared them with the saying
of manichaeus, which in his frenzy he had written most largely on these
subjects; but discovered not any account of the solstices, or equinoxes,
or the eclipses of the greater lights [[light]], nor whatever of this sort i
had learned in the books [[book]] of secular [[philosophy]]. but i was commanded to
believe; and yet it corresponded not with what had been established by
calculations and my own sight, but was quite contrary.

doth then, o [[lord]] [[god]] of [[truth]], whoso knoweth these things, therefore
please thee? surely unhappy is he who knoweth all these, and knoweth not
thee: but [[happy]] whoso knoweth thee, though he [[know]] not these. and whoso
knoweth both thee and them is not the happier for them, but for thee
only, if, knowing thee, he glorifies thee as [[god]], and is thankful, and
becomes not [[vain]] in his imaginations [[imagination]]. for as he is [[better]] off who knows
how to possess a tree, and return thanks to thee for the use thereof,
although he [[know]] not how many cubits high it is, or how wide it spreads,
than he that can measure it, and count all its boughs, and neither owns
it, nor knows [[know]] or loves [[love]] its creator: so a believer, whose all this world
of [[wealth]] is, and who having nothing, yet possesseth all things, by
cleaving unto thee, whom all things serve, though he [[know]] not even
the circles of the [[great]] bear, yet is it folly to [[doubt]] but he is in a
better [[state]] than one who can measure the heavens [[heaven]], and number the stars,
and poise the elements, yet neglecteth thee who hast made all things in
number, weight, and measure.

but yet who bade that manichaeus write on these things also, [[skill]] in
which was no element of piety? for thou hast said to [[man]], behold
piety and [[wisdom]]; of which he might be ignorant, though he had perfect
knowledge of these things; but these things, since, knowing not, he most
impudently dared to [[teach]], he plainly could have no [[knowledge]] of piety.
for it is vanity to make profession of these worldly things even when
known; but [[confession]] to thee is piety. wherefore this wanderer to this
end spake much of these things, that convicted by those who had truly
learned them, it might be manifest what understanding he had in the
other abstruser things. for he would not have himself meanly [[thought]] of,
but went about to persuade [[men]], "that the holy ghost, the comforter and
enricher of thy faithful ones, was with plenary [[authority]] personally
within him." when then he was found out to have taught falsely of the
heaven and stars, and of the motions of the sun and moon (although these
things pertain not to the doctrine of religion), yet his sacrilegious
presumption would become evident enough, seeing he delivered things
which not only he knew not, but which were falsified, with so mad a
vanity of [[pride]], that he sought to ascribe them to himself, as to a
divine [[person]].

for when i hear any [[christian]] [[brother]] ignorant of these things, and
mistaken on them, i can patiently behold such a [[man]] holding his [[opinion]];
nor do i see that any ignorance as to the position or [[character]] of the
corporeal creation can injure him, so long as he doth not [[believe]] any
thing unworthy of thee, o [[lord]], the creator of all. but it doth injure
him, if he imagine it to pertain to the form of the doctrine of piety,
and will yet affirm that too stiffly whereof he is ignorant. and yet
is even such an infirmity, in the infancy of [[faith]], borne by our mother
charity, till the new-born may grow up unto a [[perfect]] [[man]], so as not
to be carried about with every wind of doctrine. but in him who in such
wise presumed to be the teacher, source, guide, [[chief]] of all whom he
could so persuade, that whoso followed him [[thought]] that he followed,
not a mere [[man]], but thy holy spirit; who would not [[judge]] that so great
madness, when once convicted of having taught any thing false, were
to be detested and utterly rejected? but i had not as yet clearly
ascertained whether the vicissitudes of longer and shorter days and
nights, and of day and night itself, with the eclipses of the greater
lights, and whatever else of the [[kind]] i had [[read]] of in other books [[book]],
might be explained consistently with his sayings; so that, if they by
any means might, it should still remain a [[question]] to me whether it
were so or no; but i might, on account of his reputed [[sanctity]], rest my
credence upon his [[authority]].

and for almost all those nine years, wherein with unsettled [[mind]] i had
been their disciple, i had longed but too intensely for the coming of
this faustus. for the rest of the sect, whom by [[chance]] i had lighted
upon, when unable to solve my objections about these things, still held
out to me the coming of this faustus, by conference with whom these
and greater difficulties, if i had them, were to be most readily and
abundantly cleared. when then he came, i found him a [[man]] of pleasing
discourse, and who could speak fluently and in [[better]] terms, yet still
but the self-same things which they were wont to say. but what availed
the utmost neatness of the cup-bearer to my thirst for a more precious
draught? mine ears were already cloyed with the like, nor did they seem
to me therefore [[better]], because [[better]] said; nor therefore true, because
eloquent; nor the [[soul]] therefore [[wise]], because the face was comely,
and the [[language]] graceful. but they who held him out to me were no good
judges of things; and therefore to them he appeared understanding and
wise, because in words pleasing. i [[felt]] however that another sort of
people were suspicious even of [[truth]], and refused to assent to it, if
delivered in a smooth and copious discourse. but thou, o my [[god]], hadst
already taught me by wonderful and secret ways, and therefore i believe
that thou taughtest me, because it is [[truth]], nor is there besides thee
any teacher of [[truth]], where or whencesoever it may shine upon us. of
thyself therefore had i now learned, that neither ought any thing to
seem to be spoken truly, because eloquently; nor therefore falsely,
because the utterance of the lips is inharmonious; nor, again, therefore
true, because rudely delivered; nor therefore false, because the
language is [[rich]]; but that [[wisdom]] and folly are as wholesome and
unwholesome food; and adorned or unadorned phrases as courtly or country
vessels; either [[kind]] of meats may be served up in either [[kind]] of dishes.

that greediness then, wherewith i had of so long [[time]] expected that [[man]],
was delighted verily with his action and feeling when disputing, and his
choice and readiness of words to clothe his ideas [[idea]]. i was then delighted,
and, with many others and more than they, did i [[praise]] and extol him.
it troubled me, however, that in the assembly of his auditors, i was not
allowed to put in and communicate those questions [[question]] that troubled me,
in familiar converse with him. which when i might, and with my friends
began to engage his ears at such times [[time]] as it was not unbecoming for him
to discuss with me, and had brought forward such things as moved me; i
found him first utterly ignorant of liberal sciences [[science]], save grammar, and
that but in an ordinary way. but because he had [[read]] some of tully's
orations, a very few books [[book]] of seneca, some things of the poets, and such
few volumes of his own sect as were written in latin and neatly, and
was daily practised in speaking, he acquired a [[certain]] eloquence, which
proved the more pleasing and seductive because under the guidance of a
good wit, and with a [[kind]] of [[natural]] gracefulness. is it not thus, as i
recall it, o [[lord]] my [[god]], thou [[judge]] of my [[conscience]]? before thee is
my [[heart]], and my remembrance, who didst at that [[time]] direct me by the
hidden mystery of thy providence, and didst set those shameful errors of
mine before my face, that i might see and hate them.

for after it was clear that he was ignorant of those [[arts]] in which i
thought he excelled, i began to despair of his opening and solving the
difficulties which perplexed me (of which indeed however ignorant, he
might have held the truths [[truth]] of piety, had he not been a manichee). for
their books [[book]] are fraught with prolix fables, of the [[heaven]], and stars,
sun, and moon, and i now no longer [[thought]] him able satisfactorily to
decide what i much [[desired]], whether, on comparison of these things with
the calculations i had elsewhere [[read]], the account given in the books [[book]] of
manichaeus were preferable, or at least as [[good]]. which when i proposed
to be considered and discussed, he, so far modestly, shrunk from the
burthen. for he knew that he knew not these things, and was not ashamed
to confess it. for he was not one of those talking persons [[person]], many of whom
i had endured, who undertook to [[teach]] me these things, and said nothing.
but this [[man]] had a [[heart]], though not [[right]] towards thee, yet neither
altogether [[treacherous]] to himself. for he was not altogether ignorant of
his own ignorance, nor would he rashly be entangled in a dispute, whence
he could neither retreat nor extricate himself fairly. even for this i
liked him the [[better]]. for fairer is the modesty of a candid [[mind]], than
the [[knowledge]] of those things which i [[desired]]; and such i found him, in
all the more difficult and subtile questions [[question]].

my zeal for the writings of manichaeus being thus blunted, and
despairing yet more of their other teachers, seeing that in divers
things which perplexed me, he, so renowned among them, had so turned
out; i began to engage with him in the study of that literature, on
which he also was much set (and which as rhetoric-reader i was at that
time teaching [[young]] students at carthage), and to [[read]] with him, either
what himself [[desired]] to hear, or such as i judged fit for his genius.
but all my efforts whereby i had purposed to advance in that sect,
upon [[knowledge]] of that [[man]], came utterly to an end; not that i detached
myself from them altogether, but as one finding nothing [[better]], i had
settled to be content meanwhile with what i had in whatever way fallen
upon, unless by [[chance]] something more eligible should dawn upon me.
thus, that faustus, to so many a snare of [[death]], had now neither willing
nor witting it, begun to loosen that wherein i was taken. for thy hands,
o my [[god]], in the secret [[purpose]] of thy providence, did not forsake my
soul; and out of my mother's heart's [[blood]], through her tears night and
day poured out, was a [[sacrifice]] offered for me unto thee; and thou didst
deal with me by wondrous ways. thou didst it, o my [[god]]: for the steps
of a [[man]] are ordered by the [[lord]], and he shall dispose his way. or how
shall we obtain salvation, but from thy hand, re-making what it made?

thou didst deal with me, that i should be persuaded to go to [[rome]], and
to [[teach]] there rather, what i was teaching at [[carthage]]. and how i was
persuaded to this, i will not neglect to confess to thee; because herein
also the deepest recesses of thy [[wisdom]], and thy most [[present]] [[mercy]] to
us, must be considered and confessed. i did not [[wish]] therefore to go to
rome, because higher gains and higher dignities were warranted me by my
friends who persuaded me to this (though even these things had at that
time an influence over my mind), but my [[chief]] and almost only reason
was, that i heard that [[young]] [[men]] [[studied]] there more peacefully, and were
kept quiet under a restraint of more regular discipline; so that they
did not, at their pleasures [[pleasure]], petulantly rush into the school of
one whose pupils they were not, nor were even admitted without his
permission. whereas at [[carthage]] there reigns among the scholars a most
disgraceful and unruly licence. they burst in audaciously, and
with gestures almost frantic, disturb all order which any one hath
established for the [[good]] of his scholars. divers outrages they commit,
with a wonderful stolidity, punishable by [[law]], did not custom uphold
them; that custom evincing them to be the more miserable, in that they
now do as lawful what by thy eternal [[law]] shall never be lawful; and they
think they do it unpunished, whereas they are punished with the very
blindness whereby they do it, and suffer incomparably worse than what
they do. the manners then which, when a student, i would not make my
own, i was fain as a teacher to endure in others: and so i was well
pleased to go where, all that knew it, assured me that the like was not
done. but thou, my refuge and my portion in the [[land]] of the living;
that i might [[change]] my earthly dwelling for the salvation of my [[soul]],
at [[carthage]] didst goad me, that i might thereby be torn from it; and at
rome didst proffer me allurements, whereby i might be drawn thither,
by [[men]] in [[love]] with a dying [[life]], the one doing frantic, the other
promising [[vain]], things; and, to [[correct]] my steps, didst secretly use
their and my own perverseness. for both they who disturbed my quiet were
blinded with a disgraceful frenzy, and they who invited me elsewhere
savoured of [[earth]]. and i, who here detested real misery, was there
seeking unreal [[happiness]].

but why i went hence, and went thither, thou knewest, o [[god]], yet
showedst it neither to me, nor to my [[mother]], who grievously bewailed my
journey, and followed me as far as the sea. but i deceived her, holding
me by [[force]], that either she might keep me back or go with me, and i
feigned that i had a friend whom i could not leave, till he had a fair
wind to sail. and i lied to my [[mother]], and such a [[mother]], and escaped:
for this also hast thou mercifully forgiven me, preserving me, thus full
of execrable defilements, from the waters of the sea, for the water of
thy grace; whereby when i was cleansed, the streams of my mother's eyes
should be dried, with which for me she daily watered the ground under
her face. and yet refusing to return without me, i scarcely persuaded
her to stay that night in a place hard by our ship, where was an oratory
in memory of the blessed cyprian. that night i privily departed, but she
was not behind in weeping and prayer. and what, o [[lord]], was she with so
many tears asking of thee, but that thou wouldest not suffer me to sail?
but thou, in the depth of thy counsels and hearing the main point of her
desire, regardest not what she then [[asked]], that thou mightest make me
what she ever [[asked]]. the wind blew and swelled our sails, and withdrew
the shore from our sight; and she on the morrow was there, frantic with
sorrow, and with complaints and groans filled thine ears, who didst then
disregard them; whilst through my desires [[desire]], thou wert hurrying me to end
all [[desire]], and the earthly part of her affection to me was chastened
by the allotted scourge of sorrows [[sorrow]]. for she loved my being with her, as
mothers do, but much more than many; and she knew not how [[great]] joy thou
wert about to [[work]] for her out of my absence. she knew not; therefore
did she weep and wail, and by this agony there appeared in her the
inheritance of eve, with [[sorrow]] seeking what in [[sorrow]] she had brought
forth. and yet, after accusing my treachery and hardheartedness, she
betook herself again to intercede to thee for me, went to her wonted
place, and i to [[rome]].

and lo, there was i received by the scourge of bodily sickness, and i
was going down to hell, carrying all the sins [[sin]] which i had committed,
both against thee, and myself, and others, many and grievous, over and
above that bond of original [[sin]], whereby we all [[die]] in adam. for
thou hadst not forgiven me any of these things in [[christ]], nor had he
abolished by his cross the enmity which by my sins [[sin]] i had incurred with
thee. for how should he, by the crucifixion of a phantasm, which i
believed him to be? so true, then, was the [[death]] of my [[soul]], as that
of his flesh seemed to me false; and how true the [[death]] of his [[body]],
so false was the [[life]] of my [[soul]], which did not [[believe]] it. and now the
fever heightening, i was parting and departing for ever. for had i then
parted hence, whither had i departed, but into [[fire]] and torments, such
as my misdeeds deserved in the [[truth]] of thy appointment? and this she
knew not, yet in absence prayed for me. but thou, everywhere [[present]],
heardest her where she was, and, where i was, hadst compassion upon me;
that i should recover the health of my [[body]], though frenzied as yet
in my sacrilegious [[heart]]. for i did not in all that danger [[desire]] thy
baptism; and i was [[better]] as a boy, when i begged it of my mother's
piety, as i have before recited and confessed. but i had grown up to my
own shame, and i madly scoffed at the prescripts of thy medicine, who
wouldest not suffer me, being such, to [[die]] a double [[death]]. with which
wound had my mother's [[heart]] been pierced, it could never be healed. for
i cannot express the affection she bore to me, and with how much more
vehement anguish she was now in [[labour]] of me in the spirit, than at her
childbearing in the flesh.

i see not then how she should have been healed, had such a [[death]] of mine
stricken through the bowels of her [[love]]. and where would have been those
her so [[strong]] and unceasing prayers, unintermitting to thee alone? but
wouldest thou, [[god]] of mercies, despise the contrite and humbled [[heart]] of
that chaste and sober widow, so frequent in almsdeeds, so full of duty
and service to thy saints, no day intermitting the oblation at thine
altar, twice a day, morning and evening, without any intermission,
coming to thy [[church]], not for idle tattlings and old wives' fables; but
that she might hear thee in thy discourses, and thou her in her prayers.
couldest thou despise and reject from thy aid the tears of such an one,
wherewith she begged of thee not gold or silver, nor any mutable or
passing [[good]], but the salvation of her son's [[soul]]? thou, by whose gift
she was such? never, [[lord]]. yea, thou wert at hand, and wert hearing and
doing, in that order wherein thou hadst determined before that it should
be done. far be it that thou shouldest [[deceive]] her in thy visions and
answers, some whereof i have, some i have not mentioned, which she laid
up in her faithful [[heart]], and ever praying, urged upon thee, as
thine own handwriting. for thou, because thy [[mercy]] endureth for ever,
vouchsafest to those to whom thou forgivest all of their debts, to
become also a debtor by thy promises.

thou recoveredst me then of that sickness, and healedst the [[son]] of thy
handmaid, for the [[time]] in [[body]], that he might [[live]], for thee to bestow
upon him a [[better]] and more abiding health. and even then, at [[rome]], i
joined myself to those deceiving and deceived "holy ones"; not with
their disciples only (of which number was he, in whose house i had
fallen sick and recovered); but also with those whom they call "the
elect." for i still [[thought]] "that it was not we that [[sin]], but that i
know not what other [[nature]] sinned in us"; and it delighted my [[pride]], to
be [[free]] from blame; and when i had done any [[evil]], not to confess i had
done any, that thou mightest heal my [[soul]] because it had sinned against
thee: but i loved to excuse it, and to accuse i [[know]] not what other
thing, which was with me, but which i was not. but in [[truth]] it was
wholly i, and mine impiety had divided me against myself: and that sin
was the more incurable, whereby i did not [[judge]] myself a sinner; and
execrable [[iniquity]] it was, that i had rather have thee, thee, o god
almighty, to be overcome in me to my destruction, than myself of thee to
salvation. not as yet then hadst thou set a watch before my mouth, and a
door of safe keeping around my lips, that my [[heart]] might not turn
aside to wicked speeches [[speech]], to make excuses of sins [[sin]], with [[men]] that work
iniquity; and, therefore, was i still [[united]] with their elect.

but now despairing to make proficiency in that false doctrine, even
those things (with which if i should find no [[better]], i had resolved to
rest contented) i now held more laxly and carelessly. for there half
arose a [[thought]] in me that those [[philosophers]], whom they call academics,
were wiser than the rest, for that they held [[men]] ought to doubt
everything, and laid down that no [[truth]] can be comprehended by [[man]]:
for so, not then understanding even their meaning, i also was clearly
convinced that they [[thought]], as they are commonly reported. yet did i
freely and openly discourage that host of mine from that over-confidence
which i perceived him to have in those fables, which the books [[book]] of
manichaeus are full of. yet i lived in more familiar [[friendship]] with
them, than with others who were not of this heresy. nor did i maintain
it with my ancient eagerness; still my intimacy with that sect (rome
secretly harbouring many of them) made me slower to seek any other way:
especially since i despaired of finding the [[truth]], from which they had
turned me aside, in thy [[church]], o [[lord]] of [[heaven]] and [[earth]], creator of
all things visible and invisible: and it seemed to me very unseemly to
believe thee to have the shape of [[human]] flesh, and to be bounded by the
bodily lineaments of our members. and because, when i wished to [[think]] on
my [[god]], i knew not what to [[think]] of, but a mass of bodies [[body]] (for what was
not such did not seem to me to be anything), this was the [[greatest]], and
almost only cause of my inevitable error.

for hence i believed [[evil]] also to be some such [[kind]] of substance, and
to have its own foul and hideous bulk; whether gross, which they called
earth, or thin and subtile (like the [[body]] of the air), which they
imagine to be some malignant [[mind]], creeping through that [[earth]]. and
because a piety, such as it was, constrained me to [[believe]] that the good
god never created any [[evil]] [[nature]], i conceived two masses, contrary
to one another, both unbounded, but the [[evil]] narrower, the [[good]] more
expansive. and from this pestilent beginning, the other sacrilegious
conceits followed on me. for when my [[mind]] endeavoured to recur to the
catholic [[faith]], i was driven back, since that was not the catholic faith
which i [[thought]] to be so. and i seemed to myself more reverential, if i
believed of thee, my [[god]] (to whom thy mercies confess out of my mouth),
as unbounded, at least on other sides, although on that one where the
mass of [[evil]] was opposed to thee, i was constrained to confess thee
bounded; than if on all sides i should imagine thee to be bounded by the
form of a [[human]] [[body]]. and it seemed to me [[better]] to [[believe]] thee to have
created no [[evil]] (which to me ignorant seemed not some only, but a bodily
substance, because i could not conceive of [[mind]] unless as a subtile
body, and that diffused in definite spaces), than to [[believe]] the nature
of [[evil]], such as i conceived it, could come from thee. yea, and our
saviour himself, thy only begotten, i believed to have been reached
forth (as it were) for our salvation, out of the mass of thy most lucid
substance, so as to [[believe]] nothing of him, but what i could imagine in
my vanity. his [[nature]] then, being such, i [[thought]] could not be born
of the virgin [[mary]], without being mingled with the flesh: and how that
which i had so figured to myself could be mingled, and not defiled, i
saw not. i feared therefore to [[believe]] him born in the flesh, lest
i should be forced to [[believe]] him defiled by the flesh. now will thy
spiritual ones mildly and lovingly smile upon me, if they shall read
these my confessions. yet such was i.

furthermore, what the manichees had criticised in thy scriptures [[scripture]], i
thought could not be defended; yet at times [[time]] verily i had a [[wish]] to
confer upon these several points with some one very well skilled in
those books [[book]], and to make [[trial]] what he [[thought]] thereon; for the words
of one helpidius, as he spoke and disputed face to face against the
said manichees, had begun to stir me even at [[carthage]]: in that he
had produced things out of the scriptures [[scripture]], not easily withstood, the
manichees' [[answer]] whereto seemed to me [[weak]]. and this [[answer]] they
liked not to give publicly, but only to us in private. it was, that the
scriptures of the new testament had been corrupted by i [[know]] not whom,
who wished to engraff the [[law]] of the [[jews]] upon the [[christian]] [[faith]]: yet
themselves produced not any uncorrupted copies. but i, conceiving of
things corporeal only, was mainly held down, vehemently [[oppressed]] and
in a manner suffocated by those "masses"; panting under which after the
breath of thy [[truth]], i could not breathe it pure and untainted.

i began then diligently to practise that for which i came to [[rome]], to
teach rhetoric; and first, to gather some to my house, to whom, and
through whom, i had begun to be known; when lo, i found other offences
committed in [[rome]], to which i was not exposed in [[africa]]. true, those
"subvertings" by profligate [[young]] [[men]] were not here practised, as was
told me: but on a sudden, said they, to avoid paying their
master's stipend, a number of youths [[youth]] plot together, and remove to
another;--breakers of [[faith]], who for [[love]] of [[money]] hold [[justice]] cheap.
these also my [[heart]] hated, though not with a [[perfect]] [[hatred]]: for
perchance i hated them more because i was to suffer by them, than
because they did things utterly unlawful. of a [[truth]] such are base
persons, and they go a whoring from thee, loving these fleeting
mockeries of things temporal, and filthy lucre, which fouls the hand
that grasps it; hugging the fleeting [[world]], and despising thee, who
abidest, and recallest, and forgivest the adulteress [[soul]] of [[man]], when
she returns to thee. and now i hate such depraved and crooked persons [[person]],
though i [[love]] them if corrigible, so as to prefer to [[money]] the learning
which they acquire, and to learning, thee, o [[god]], the [[truth]] and fulness
of assured [[good]], and most pure [[peace]]. but then i rather for my own sake
misliked them [[evil]], than liked and wished them [[good]] for thine.

when therefore they of milan had sent to [[rome]] to the prefect of the
city, to furnish them with a rhetoric reader for their [[city]], and sent
him at the [[public]] expense, i made application (through those very
persons, intoxicated with manichaean vanities, to be freed wherefrom
i was to go, neither of us however knowing it) that symmachus, then
prefect of the [[city]], would try me by setting me some [[subject]], and so
send me. to milan i came, to ambrose the bishop, known to the whole
world as among the [[best]] of [[men]], thy devout servant; whose eloquent
discourse did then plentifully dispense unto thy [[people]] the flour of thy
wheat, the gladness of thy [[oil]], and the sober inebriation of thy wine.
to him was i unknowing [[led]] by thee, that by him i might knowingly be
led to thee. that [[man]] of [[god]] received me as a [[father]], and showed me an
episcopal [[kindness]] on my coming. thenceforth i began to [[love]] him, at
first indeed not as a teacher of the [[truth]] (which i utterly despaired
of in thy church), but as a [[person]] [[kind]] towards myself. and i listened
diligently to him preaching to the [[people]], not with that intent i ought,
but, as it were, trying his eloquence, whether it answered the fame
thereof, or flowed fuller or lower than was reported; and i hung on his
words attentively; but of the matter i was as a careless and scornful
looker-on; and i was delighted with the sweetness of his discourse,
more recondite, yet in manner less winning and harmonious, than that of
faustus. of the matter, however, there was no comparison; for the one
was wandering amid manichaean delusions, the other teaching salvation
most soundly. but salvation is far from sinners, such as i then stood
before him; and yet was i drawing nearer by little and little, and
unconsciously.

for though i took no pains [[pain]] to learn what he spake, but only to hear how
he spake (for that empty [[care]] alone was left me, despairing of a way,
open for [[man]], to thee), yet together with the words which i would
choose, came also into my [[mind]] the things which i would refuse; for
i could not separate them. and while i opened my [[heart]] to admit "how
eloquently he spake," there also entered "how truly he spake"; but this
by degrees [[degree]]. for first, these things also had now begun to appear to
me capable of defence; and the catholic [[faith]], for which i had thought
nothing could be said against the manichees' objections, i now thought
might be maintained without shamelessness; especially after i had heard
one or two places of the old testament resolved, and ofttimes "in a
figure," which when i understood literally, i was slain spiritually.
very many places then of those books [[book]] having been explained, i now blamed
my despair, in believing that no [[answer]] could be given to such as hated
and scoffed at the [[law]] and the prophets [[prophet]]. yet did i not therefore then
see that the catholic way was to be held, because it also could find
learned maintainers, who could at large and with some show of reason
answer objections; nor that what i held was therefore to be condemned,
because both sides could be maintained. for the catholic cause seemed to
me in such sort not vanquished, as still not as yet to be victorious.

hereupon i earnestly bent my [[mind]], to see if in any way i could by any
certain proof convict the manichees of falsehood. could i once have
conceived a [[spiritual]] substance, all their strongholds had been beaten
down, and cast utterly out of my [[mind]]; but i could not. notwithstanding,
concerning the frame of this [[world]], and the whole of [[nature]], which the
senses of the flesh can reach to, as i more and more considered and
compared things, i judged the tenets of most of the [[philosophers]] to have
been much more probable. so then after the manner of the academics (as
they are supposed) doubting of every thing, and wavering between all, i
settled so far, that the manichees were to be abandoned; judging that,
even while doubting, i might not continue in that sect, to which i
already preferred some of the [[philosophers]]; to which philosophers
notwithstanding, for that they were without the saving name of [[christ]],
i utterly refused to commit the cure of my sick [[soul]]. i determined
therefore so long to be a catechumen in the catholic [[church]], to which
i had been commended by my parents, till something [[certain]] should dawn
upon me, whither i might steer my course.




book vi


o thou, my [[hope]] from my [[youth]], where wert thou to me, and whither wert
thou gone? hadst not thou created me, and separated me from the beasts
of the field, and fowls of the air? thou hadst made me wiser, yet did i
walk in darkness, and in slippery places, and sought thee abroad out of
myself, and found not the [[god]] of my [[heart]]; and had come into the depths
of the sea, and distrusted and despaired of ever finding [[truth]]. my
mother had now come to me, resolute through piety, following me over sea
and [[land]], in all perils confiding in thee. for in perils of the sea, she
comforted the very mariners (by whom passengers unacquainted with the
deep, use rather to be comforted when troubled), assuring them of a safe
arrival, because thou hadst by a vision assured her thereof. she found
me in grievous peril, through despair of ever finding [[truth]]. but when
i had discovered to her that i was now no longer a manichee, though
not yet a catholic [[christian]], she was not overjoyed, as at something
unexpected; although she was now assured concerning that part of my
misery, for which she bewailed me as one [[dead]], though to be reawakened
by thee, carrying me forth upon the bier of her thoughts [[thought]], that thou
mightest say to the [[son]] of the widow, [[young]] [[man]], i say unto thee, arise;
and he should revive, and begin to speak, and thou shouldest deliver him
to his [[mother]]. her [[heart]] then was shaken with no tumultuous exultation,
when she heard that what she daily with tears [[desired]] of thee was
already in so [[great]] part realised; in that, though i had not yet
attained the [[truth]], i was rescued from falsehood; but, as being assured,
that thou, who hadst promised the whole, wouldest one day give the rest,
most calmly, and with a [[heart]] full of confidence, she replied to me,
"she believed in [[christ]], that before she departed this [[life]], she should
see me a catholic believer." thus much to me. but to thee, fountain
of mercies, poured she forth more copious prayers and tears, that thou
wouldest hasten thy [[help]], and enlighten my darkness; and she hastened
the more eagerly to the [[church]], and hung upon the lips of ambrose,
praying for the fountain of that water, which springeth up unto life
everlasting. but that [[man]] she loved as an angel of [[god]], because she knew
that by him i had been brought for the [[present]] to that doubtful [[state]] of
faith i now was in, through which she anticipated most confidently that
i should pass from sickness unto health, after the access, as it were,
of a sharper fit, which physicians call "the crisis."

when then my [[mother]] had once, as she was wont in afric, brought to the
churches built in memory of the saints, [[certain]] cakes, and bread and
wine, and was forbidden by the door-keeper; so soon as she knew that the
bishop had forbidden this, she so piously and obediently embraced
his wishes [[wish]], that i myself wondered how readily she censured her own
practice, rather than discuss his prohibition. for wine-bibbing did not
lay siege to her spirit, nor did [[love]] of wine provoke her to [[hatred]] of
the [[truth]], as it doth too many (both [[men]] and women), who revolt at a
lesson of sobriety, as [[men]] well-drunk at a draught mingled with
water. but she, when she had brought her basket with the accustomed
festival-food, to be but tasted by herself, and then given away, never
joined therewith more than one small cup of wine, diluted according to
her own abstemious habits, which for courtesy she would taste. and if
there were many churches [[church]] of the departed saints that were to be honoured
in that manner, she still carried round that same one cup, to be
used every where; and this, though not only made very watery, but
unpleasantly heated with carrying about, she would distribute to those
about her by small sips; for she sought there devotion, not [[pleasure]].
so soon, then, as she found this custom to be forbidden by that famous
preacher and most pious prelate, even to those that would use it
soberly, lest so an [[occasion]] of excess might be given to the drunken;
and for these, as it were, anniversary [[funeral]] solemnities did much
resemble the superstition of the gentiles, she most willingly forbare
it: and for a basket filled with fruits of the [[earth]], she had learned to
bring to the churches [[church]] of the martyrs a breast filled with more
purified petitions, and to give what she could to the [[poor]]; that so
the communication of the lord's [[body]] might be there rightly celebrated,
where, after the [[example]] of his passion, the martyrs had been sacrificed
and crowned. but yet it seems to me, o [[lord]] my [[god]], and thus thinks [[think]] my
heart of it in thy sight, that perhaps she would not so readily have
yielded to the cutting off of this custom, had it been forbidden by
another, whom she loved not as ambrose, whom, for my salvation,
she loved most entirely; and he her again, for her most religious
conversation, whereby in [[good]] works [[work]], so fervent in spirit, she was
constant at [[church]]; so that, when he saw me, he often burst forth into
her praises [[praise]]; congratulating me that i had such a [[mother]]; not knowing
what a [[son]] she had in me, who doubted of all these things, and imagined
the way to [[life]] could not be found out.

nor did i yet groan in my prayers, that thou wouldest [[help]] me; but
my spirit was wholly intent on learning, and restless to dispute. and
ambrose himself, as the [[world]] counts [[happy]], i esteemed a [[happy]] [[man]], whom
personages so [[great]] held in such [[honour]]; only his celibacy seemed to me
a painful course. but what [[hope]] he bore within him, what struggles he
had against the temptations which beset his very excellencies, or what
comfort in adversities, and what sweet joys thy bread had for the hidden
mouth of his spirit, when chewing the cud thereof, i neither could
conjecture, nor had experienced. nor did he [[know]] the tides of my
feelings, or the abyss of my danger. for i could not ask of him, what
i would as i would, being shut out both from his ear and [[speech]] by
multitudes of busy [[people]], whose weaknesses he served. with whom when he
was not taken up (which was but a little time), he was either refreshing
his [[body]] with the sustenance absolutely necessary, or his [[mind]] with
reading. but when he was reading, his eye glided over the pages, and
his [[heart]] searched out the sense, but his voice and tongue were at rest.
ofttimes when we had come (for no [[man]] was forbidden to enter, nor was it
his wont that any who came should be announced to him), we saw him thus
reading to himself, and never otherwise; and having long sat silent
(for who durst intrude on one so intent?) we were fain to depart,
conjecturing that in the small interval which he obtained, [[free]] from the
din of others' [[business]], for the recruiting of his [[mind]], he was loth to
be taken off; and perchance he dreaded lest if the author he [[read]] should
deliver any thing obscurely, some attentive or perplexed hearer should
desire him to expound it, or to discuss some of the harder questions [[question]]; so
that his [[time]] being thus spent, he could not turn over so many volumes
as he [[desired]]; although the preserving of his voice (which a very little
speaking would weaken) might be the truer [[reason]] for his reading to
himself. but with what intent soever he did it, certainly in such a man
it was [[good]].

i however certainly had no opportunity of enquiring what i wished of
that so holy oracle of thine, his breast, unless the thing might be
answered briefly. but those tides in me, to be poured out to him,
required his full leisure, and never found it. i heard him indeed every
lord's day, rightly expounding the word of [[truth]] among the [[people]]; and
i was more and more convinced that all the knots of those crafty
calumnies, which those our deceivers had knit against the [[divine]] books [[book]],
could be unravelled. but when i understood withal, that "man created
by thee, after thine own image," was not so understood by thy spiritual
sons, whom of the catholic [[mother]] thou hast born again through grace,
as though they believed and conceived of thee as bounded by [[human]] shape
(although what a [[spiritual]] substance should be i had not even a faint or
shadowy notion); yet, with joy i blushed at having so many years barked
not against the catholic [[faith]], but against the fictions of carnal
imaginations. for so rash and impious had i been, that what i ought by
enquiring to have learned, i had pronounced on, condemning. for thou,
most high, and most near; most secret, and most [[present]]; who hast not
limbs some larger, some smaller, but art [[arts]] wholly every where, and no
where in space, art [[arts]] not of such corporeal shape, yet hast thou made man
after thine own image; and behold, from head to foot is he contained in
space.

ignorant then how this thy image should subsist, i should have knocked
and proposed the [[doubt]], how it was to be believed, not insultingly
opposed it, as if believed. [[doubt]], then, what to hold for [[certain]],
the more sharply gnawed my [[heart]], the more ashamed i was, that so long
deluded and deceived by the promise of certainties, i had with childish
error and vehemence, prated of so many uncertainties. for that they were
falsehoods became clear to me later. however i was [[certain]] that they
were uncertain, and that i had formerly accounted them [[certain]], when
with a blind contentiousness, i accused thy catholic [[church]], whom i now
discovered, not indeed as yet to [[teach]] truly, but at least not to teach
that for which i had grievously censured her. so i was confounded, and
converted: and i joyed, o my [[god]], that the one only [[church]], the [[body]] of
thine only [[son]] (wherein the name of [[christ]] had been put upon me as an
infant), had no taste for infantine conceits; nor in her sound doctrine
maintained any tenet which should confine thee, the creator of all, in
space, however [[great]] and large, yet bounded every where by the limits of
a [[human]] form.

i joyed also that the old scriptures [[scripture]] of the [[law]] and the prophets [[prophet]] were
laid before me, not now to be perused with that eye to which before they
seemed absurd, when i reviled thy holy ones for so thinking, whereas
indeed they [[thought]] not so: and with joy i heard ambrose in his sermons
to the [[people]], oftentimes most diligently recommend this text for a
rule, the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth [[life]]; whilst he drew
aside the mystic veil, laying open spiritually what, according to the
letter, seemed to [[teach]] something unsound; teaching herein nothing that
offended me, though he taught what i knew not as yet, whether it were
true. for i kept my [[heart]] from assenting to any thing, fearing to fall
headlong; but by hanging in suspense i was the worse killed. for i
wished to be as assured of the things i saw not, as i was that seven and
three are ten. for i was not so mad as to [[think]] that even this could not
be comprehended; but i [[desired]] to have other things as clear as this,
whether things corporeal, which were not [[present]] to my senses, or
spiritual, whereof i knew not how to conceive, except corporeally. and
by believing might i have been cured, that so the eyesight of my soul
being cleared, might in some way be directed to thy [[truth]], which abideth
always, and in no part faileth. but as it happens that one who has tried
a [[bad]] physician, fears [[fear]] to trust himself with a [[good]] one, so was it with
the health of my [[soul]], which could not be healed but by believing, and
lest it should [[believe]] falsehoods, refused to be cured; resisting thy
hands, who hast prepared the medicines of [[faith]], and hast applied
them to the diseases of the whole [[world]], and given unto them so great
authority.

being [[led]], however, from this to prefer the catholic doctrine, i felt
that her proceeding was more unassuming and honest, in that she required
to be believed things not demonstrated (whether it was that they could
in themselves be demonstrated but not to [[certain]] persons [[person]], or could not
at all be), whereas among the manichees our credulity was mocked by a
promise of [[certain]] [[knowledge]], and then so many most fabulous and
absurd things were imposed to be believed, because they could not be
demonstrated. then thou, o [[lord]], little by little with most tender and
most merciful hand, touching and composing my [[heart]], didst persuade
me--considering what innumerable things i believed, which i saw not, nor
was [[present]] while they were done, as so many things in secular [[history]],
so many reports of places and of cities [[city]], which i had not seen; so many
of [[friends]], so many of physicians, so many continually of other [[men]],
which unless we should [[believe]], we should do nothing at all in this
life; lastly, with how unshaken an assurance i believed of what
parents i was born, which i could not [[know]], had i not believed upon
hearsay--considering all this, thou didst persuade me, that not they who
believed thy books [[book]] (which thou hast established in so [[great]] authority
among almost all nations), but they who believed them not, were to be
blamed; and that they were not to be heard, who should say to me, "how
knowest thou those scriptures [[scripture]] to have been imparted unto [[mankind]] by the
spirit of the one true and most true [[god]]?" for this very thing was
of all most to be believed, since no contentiousness of blasphemous
questionings, of all that multitude which i had [[read]] in the
self-contradicting [[philosophers]], could wring this [[belief]] from me,
"that thou art" whatsoever thou wert (what i knew not), and "that the
government of [[human]] things belongs to thee."

this i believed, sometimes more strongly, more weakly otherwhiles; yet i
ever believed both that thou wert, and hadst a [[care]] of us; though i was
ignorant, both what was to be [[thought]] of thy substance, and what way led
or [[led]] back to thee. since then we were too [[weak]] by abstract reasonings
to find out [[truth]]: and for this very cause needed the [[authority]] of holy
writ; i had now begun to [[believe]] that thou wouldest never have given
such excellency of [[authority]] to that writ in all lands [[land]], hadst thou not
willed thereby to be believed in, thereby sought. for now what things,
sounding strangely in the [[scripture]], were wont to offend me, having
heard divers of them expounded satisfactorily, i referred to the depth
of the mysteries, and its [[authority]] appeared to me the more venerable,
and more worthy of [[religious]] credence, in that, while it lay open to all
to [[read]], it reserved the majesty of its mysteries within its profounder
meaning, stooping to all in the [[great]] plainness of its words and
lowliness of its style, yet calling forth the intensest application of
such as are not [[light]] of [[heart]]; that so it might receive all in its open
bosom, and through narrow passages waft over towards thee some few, yet
many more than if it stood not aloft on such a height of [[authority]], nor
drew multitudes within its bosom by its holy lowliness. these things
i [[thought]] on, and thou wert with me; i sighed, and thou heardest me; i
wavered, and thou didst guide me; i wandered through the broad way of
the [[world]], and thou didst not forsake me.

i panted after honours [[honour]], gains, [[marriage]]; and thou deridedst me. in these
desires i underwent most bitter crosses, thou being the more gracious,
the less thou sufferedst aught to grow sweet to me, which was not thou.
behold my [[heart]], o [[lord]], who wouldest i should [[remember]] all this, and
confess to thee. let my [[soul]] cleave unto thee, now that thou hast freed
it from that fast-holding birdlime of [[death]]. how wretched was it! and
thou didst irritate the feeling of its wound, that forsaking all else,
it might be converted unto thee, who art [[arts]] above all, and without whom all
things would be nothing; be converted, and be healed. how miserable was
i then, and how didst thou deal with me, to make me [[feel]] my misery on
that day, when i was preparing to recite a panegyric of the [[emperor]],
wherein i was to utter many a [[lie]], and lying, was to be applauded by
those who knew i lied, and my [[heart]] was panting with these anxieties,
and boiling with the feverishness of consuming thoughts [[thought]]. for, passing
through one of the streets of milan, i observed a [[poor]] beggar, then, i
suppose, with a full belly, joking and joyous: and i sighed, and spoke
to the [[friends]] around me, of the many sorrows [[sorrow]] of our frenzies; for that
by all such efforts of ours, as those wherein i then toiled dragging
along, under the goading of [[desire]], the burthen of my own wretchedness,
and, by dragging, augmenting it, we yet looked to arrive only at that
very joyousness whither that beggar-man had arrived before us, who
should never perchance attain it. for what he had obtained by means of a
few begged pence, the same was i plotting for by many a toilsome turning
and winding; the joy of a temporary felicity. for he verily had not the
true joy; but yet i with those my ambitious designs was seeking one much
less true. and certainly he was joyous, i anxious; he void of [[care]], i
full of fears [[fear]]. but should any ask me, had i rather be merry or fearful?
i would [[answer]] merry. again, if he [[asked]] had i rather be such as he was,
or what i then was? i should choose to be myself, though worn with cares
and fears [[fear]]; but out of [[wrong]] [[judgment]]; for, was it the [[truth]]? for i ought
not to prefer myself to him, because more learned than he, seeing i
had no joy therein, but sought to please [[men]] by it; and that not to
instruct, but simply to please. wherefore also thou didst break my bones
with the staff of thy correction.

away with those then from my [[soul]] who say to her, "it makes a difference
whence a man's [[man]] joy is. that beggar-man joyed in drunkenness; thou
desiredst to joy in [[glory]]." what [[glory]], [[lord]]? that which is not in
thee. for even as his was no true joy, so was that no true [[glory]]: and
it overthrew my [[soul]] more. he that very night should digest his
drunkenness; but i had slept and risen again with mine, and was to sleep
again, and again to rise with it, how many days, thou, [[god]], knowest. but
"it doth make a difference whence a man's [[man]] joy is." i [[know]] it, and the
joy of a faithful [[hope]] lieth incomparably beyond such vanity. yea, and
so was he then beyond me: for he verily was the happier; not only for
that he was thoroughly drenched in mirth, i disembowelled with cares [[care]]:
but he, by [[fair]] wishes [[wish]], had gotten wine; i, by lying, was seeking for
empty, swelling [[praise]]. much to this [[purpose]] said i then to my [[friends]]:
and i often marked in them how it fared with me; and i found it went ill
with me, and [[grieved]], and doubled that very ill; and if any prosperity
smiled on me, i was loth to catch at it, for almost before i could grasp
it, it flew away.

these things we, who were living as [[friends]] together, bemoaned together,
but chiefly and most familiarly did i speak thereof with alypius and
nebridius, of whom alypius was born in the same town with me, of persons
of [[chief]] rank there, but younger than i. for he had [[studied]] under me,
both when i first lectured in our town, and afterwards at [[carthage]], and
he loved me much, because i seemed to him [[kind]], and learned; and i him,
for his [[great]] towardliness to [[virtue]], which was eminent enough in one of
no greater years. yet the whirlpool of carthaginian habits (amongst whom
those idle spectacles are hotly followed) had drawn him into the
madness of the circus. but while he was miserably tossed therein, and
i, professing rhetoric there, had a [[public]] school, as yet he used not my
teaching, by [[reason]] of some unkindness risen betwixt his [[father]] and me.
i had found then how deadly he doted upon the circus, and was deeply
grieved that he seemed likely, nay, or had thrown away so [[great]] promise:
yet had i no means of advising or with a sort of constraint reclaiming
him, either by the [[kindness]] of a friend, or the [[authority]] of a master.
for i supposed that he [[thought]] of me as did his [[father]]; but he was not
such; laying aside then his father's [[mind]] in that matter, he began to
greet me, come sometimes into my lecture room, hear a little, and be
gone.

i however had forgotten to deal with him, that he should not, through
a blind and headlong [[desire]] of [[vain]] pastimes, undo so [[good]] a wit. but
thou, o [[lord]], who guidest the course of all thou hast created, hadst
not forgotten him, who was one day to be among thy [[children]], priest
and dispenser of thy sacrament; and that his amendment might plainly be
attributed to thyself, thou effectedst it through me, unknowingly. for
as one day i sat in my accustomed place, with my scholars before me,
he entered, greeted me, sat down, and applied his [[mind]] to what i
then handled. i had by [[chance]] a passage in hand, which while i was
explaining, a likeness from the circensian races [[race]] occurred to me, as
likely to make what i would convey pleasanter and plainer, seasoned
with biting mockery of those whom that madness had enthralled; [[god]], thou
knowest that i then [[thought]] not of curing alypius of that infection. but
he took it wholly to himself, and [[thought]] that i said it simply for his
sake. and whence another would have taken [[occasion]] of offence with me,
that right-minded [[youth]] took as a ground of being offended at himself,
and loving me more fervently. for thou hadst said it long ago, and put
it into thy [[book]], rebuke a [[wise]] [[man]] and he will [[love]] thee. but i had
not rebuked him, but thou, who employest all, knowing or not knowing, in
that order which thyself knowest (and that order is just), didst of my
heart and tongue make burning coals, by which to set on [[fire]] the
hopeful [[mind]], thus languishing, and so cure it. let him be silent in thy
praises, who considers not thy mercies, which confess unto thee out of
my inmost [[soul]]. for he upon that [[speech]] burst out of that pit so deep,
wherein he was wilfully plunged, and was blinded with its wretched
pastimes; and he shook his [[mind]] with a [[strong]] self-command; whereupon
all the filths of the circensian pastimes flew off from him, nor came he
again thither. upon this, he prevailed with his unwilling [[father]] that he
might be my scholar. he gave way, and gave in. and alypius beginning
to be my hearer again, was involved in the same superstition with me,
loving in the manichees that show of continency which he supposed true
and unfeigned. whereas it was a senseless and seducing continency,
ensnaring precious souls [[soul]], unable as yet to reach the depth of [[virtue]],
yet readily beguiled with the surface of what was but a shadowy and
counterfeit [[virtue]].

he, not forsaking that secular course which his parents had charmed him
to pursue, had gone before me to [[rome]], to study [[law]], and there he was
carried away incredibly with an incredible eagerness after the shows of
gladiators. for being utterly averse to and detesting spectacles, he was
one day by [[chance]] met by divers of his acquaintance and fellow-students
coming from dinner, and they with a familiar [[violence]] haled him,
vehemently refusing and resisting, into the amphitheatre, during these
cruel and deadly shows, he thus protesting: "though you hale my [[body]] to
that place, and there set me, can you [[force]] me also to turn my [[mind]] or
my [[eyes]] to those shows? i shall then be absent while [[present]], and
so shall overcome both you and them." they, hearing this, [[led]] him on
nevertheless, desirous perchance to try that very thing, whether he
could do as he said. when they were come thither, and had taken their
places as they could, the whole place kindled with that savage pastime.
but he, closing the passage of his [[eyes]], forbade his [[mind]] to range
abroad after such [[evil]]; and would he had stopped his ears also! for in
the [[fight]], when one fell, a mighty cry of the whole [[people]] striking him
strongly, overcome by curiosity, and as if prepared to despise and be
superior to it whatsoever it were, even when seen, he opened his [[eyes]],
and was stricken with a deeper wound in his [[soul]] than the other, whom he
desired to behold, was in his [[body]]; and he fell more miserably than he
upon whose fall that mighty noise was raised, which entered through his
ears, and unlocked his [[eyes]], to make way for the striking and beating
down of a [[soul]], bold rather than resolute, and the weaker, in that it
had presumed on itself, which ought to have relied on thee. for so soon
as he saw that [[blood]], he therewith drunk down savageness; nor turned
away, but fixed his eye, drinking in frenzy, unawares, and was delighted
with that guilty [[fight]], and intoxicated with the bloody pastime. nor was
he now the [[man]] he came, but one of the throng he came unto, yea, a true
associate of theirs that brought him thither. why say more? he beheld,
shouted, kindled, carried thence with him the madness which should goad
him to return not only with them who first drew him thither, but also
before them, yea and to draw in others. yet thence didst thou with a
most [[strong]] and most merciful hand pluck him, and taughtest him to have
confidence not in himself, but in thee. but this was after.

but this was already being laid up in his memory to be a medicine
hereafter. so was that also, that when he was yet studying under me at
carthage, and was thinking over at mid-day in the market-place what he
was to say by [[heart]] (as scholars use to practise), thou sufferedst him
to be apprehended by the officers of the market-place for a thief. for
no other cause, i deem, didst thou, our [[god]], suffer it, but that he who
was hereafter to prove so [[great]] a [[man]], should already begin to learn
that in judging of causes, [[man]] was not readily to be condemned by man
out of a rash credulity. for as he was walking up and down by himself
before the judgment-seat, with his note-book and pen, lo, a [[young]] [[man]], a
lawyer, the real thief, privily bringing a hatchet, got in, unperceived
by alypius, as far as the leaden gratings which fence in the
silversmiths' shops, and began to cut away the lead. but the noise of
the hatchet being heard, the silversmiths beneath began to make a stir,
and sent to apprehend whomever they should find. but he, hearing their
voices, ran away, leaving his hatchet, fearing to be taken with it.
alypius now, who had not seen him enter, was aware of his going, and
saw with what speed he made away. and being desirous to [[know]] the matter,
entered the place; where finding the hatchet, he was standing, wondering
and considering it, when behold, those that had been sent, find him
alone with the hatchet in his hand, the noise whereof had startled and
brought them thither. they seize him, hale him away, and gathering the
dwellers in the market-place together, boast of having taken a notorious
thief, and so he was being [[led]] away to be taken before the [[judge]].

but thus far was alypius to be instructed. for forthwith, o [[lord]], thou
succouredst his innocency, whereof thou alone wert witness. for as he
was being [[led]] either to prison or to [[punishment]], a [[certain]] architect met
them, who had the [[chief]] charge of the [[public]] buildings. glad they
were to meet him especially, by whom they were wont to be suspected of
stealing the goods [[good]] lost out of the marketplace, as though to show him at
last by whom these thefts were committed. he, however, had divers times
seen alypius at a [[certain]] senator's house, to whom he often went to pay
his respects [[respect]]; and recognising him immediately, took him aside by the
hand, and enquiring the [[occasion]] of so [[great]] a calamity, heard the whole
matter, and bade all [[present]], amid much uproar and threats, to go with
him. so they came to the house of the [[young]] [[man]] who had done the
deed. there, before the door, was a boy so [[young]] as to be likely, not
apprehending any harm to his master, to disclose the whole. for he
had attended his master to the market-place. whom so soon as alypius
remembered, he told the architect: and he showing the hatchet to the
boy, [[asked]] him "whose that was?" "ours," quoth he presently: and being
further questioned, he discovered every thing. thus the crime being
transferred to that house, and the multitude ashamed, which had begun
to insult over alypius, he who was to be a dispenser of thy word, and an
examiner of many causes in thy [[church]], went away [[better]] experienced and
instructed.

him then i had found at [[rome]], and he clave to me by a most [[strong]] tie,
and went with me to milan, both that he might not leave me, and might
practise something of the [[law]] he had [[studied]], more to please his parents
than himself. there he had thrice sat as assessor, with an uncorruptness
much wondered at by others, he wondering at others rather who could
prefer gold to honesty. his [[character]] was tried besides, not only with
the bait of covetousness, but with the goad of [[fear]]. at [[rome]] he was
assessor to the count of the italian treasury. there was at that [[time]] a
very powerful senator, to whose favours many stood indebted, many much
feared. he would needs, by his usual [[power]], have a thing allowed him
which by the laws [[law]] was unallowed. alypius resisted it: a bribe was
promised; with all his [[heart]] he scorned it: threats were held out; he
trampled upon them: all wondering at so unwonted a spirit, which neither
desired the [[friendship]], nor feared the enmity of one so [[great]] and so
mightily renowned for innumerable means of doing [[good]] or [[evil]]. and the
very [[judge]], whose councillor alypius was, although also unwilling
it should be, yet did not openly refuse, but put the matter off upon
alypius, alleging that he would not allow him to do it: for in [[truth]] had
the [[judge]] done it, alypius would have decided otherwise. with this one
thing in the way of learning was he well-nigh seduced, that he might
have books [[book]] copied for him at praetorian prices, but consulting [[justice]],
he altered his deliberation for the [[better]]; esteeming equity whereby he
was hindered more gainful than the [[power]] whereby he were allowed. these
are slight things, but he that is faithful in little, is faithful also
in much. nor can that any how be void, which proceeded out of the mouth
of thy [[truth]]: if ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon,
who will commit to your trust true riches [[rich]]? and if ye have not been
faithful in that which is another man's [[man]], who shall give you that which
is your own? he being such, did at that [[time]] cleave to me, and with me
wavered in [[purpose]], what course of [[life]] was to be taken.

nebridius also, who having left his native [[country]] near [[carthage]], yea
and [[carthage]] itself, where he had much lived, leaving his excellent
family-estate and house, and a [[mother]] behind, who was not to [[follow]] him,
had come to milan, for no other [[reason]] but that with me he might [[live]] in
a most ardent search after [[truth]] and [[wisdom]]. like me he sighed, like
me he wavered, an ardent searcher after true [[life]], and a most acute
examiner of the most difficult questions [[question]]. thus were there the mouths
of three indigent persons [[person]], sighing out their wants one to another, and
waiting upon thee that thou mightest give them their meat in due season.
and in all the bitterness which by thy [[mercy]] followed our worldly
affairs, as we looked towards the end, why we should suffer all this,
darkness met us; and we turned away groaning, and saying, how long shall
these things be? this too we often said; and so saying forsook them not,
for as yet there dawned nothing [[certain]], which these forsaken, we might
embrace.

and i, viewing and reviewing things, most wondered at the length of time
from that my nineteenth year, wherein i had begun to kindle with the
desire of [[wisdom]], settling when i had found her, to abandon all the
empty hopes [[hope]] and lying frenzies of [[vain]] desires [[desire]]. and lo, i was now in
my thirtieth year, sticking in the same mire, greedy of enjoying things
present, which passed away and wasted my [[soul]]; while i said to myself,
"tomorrow i shall find it; it will appear manifestly and i shall grasp
it; lo, faustus the manichee will come, and clear every thing! o you
great [[men]], ye academicians, it is true then, that no certainty can
be attained for the ordering of life! nay, let us search the more
diligently, and despair not. lo, things in the ecclesiastical books
are not absurd to us now, which sometimes seemed absurd, and may be
otherwise taken, and in a [[good]] sense. i will take my stand, where, as
a child, my parents placed me, until the clear [[truth]] be found out. but
where shall it be sought or when? ambrose has no leisure; we have no
leisure to [[read]]; where shall we find even the books [[book]]? whence, or when
procure them? from whom borrow them? let set times [[time]] be appointed, and
certain hours be ordered for the health of our [[soul]]. [[great]] [[hope]] has
dawned; the catholic [[faith]] teaches [[teach]] not what we [[thought]], and vainly
accused it of; her instructed members hold it profane to [[believe]] [[god]] to
be bounded by the figure of a [[human]] [[body]]: and do we [[doubt]] to 'knock,'
that the rest 'may be opened'? the forenoons our scholars take up; what
do we during the rest? why not this? but when then [[pay]] we court to our
great [[friends]], whose favour we need? when compose what we may sell
to scholars? when refresh ourselves, unbending our minds [[mind]] from this
intenseness of [[care]]?

"perish every thing, dismiss we these empty vanities, and betake
ourselves to the one search for truth! [[life]] is [[vain]], [[death]] uncertain; if
it steals upon us on a sudden, in what [[state]] shall we depart hence?
and where shall we learn what here we have neglected? and shall we not
rather suffer the [[punishment]] of this negligence? what, if [[death]] itself
cut off and end all [[care]] and feeling? then must this be ascertained.
but [[god]] forbid this! it is no [[vain]] and empty thing, that the excellent
dignity of the [[authority]] of the [[christian]] [[faith]] hath overspread the
whole [[world]]. never would such and so [[great]] things be by [[god]] wrought for
us, if with the [[death]] of the [[body]] the [[life]] of the [[soul]] came to an end.
wherefore delay then to abandon worldly hopes [[hope]], and give ourselves wholly
to seek after [[god]] and the blessed [[life]]? but wait! even those things are
pleasant; they have some, and no small sweetness. we must not lightly
abandon them, for it were a shame to return again to them. see, it is
no [[great]] matter now to obtain some station, and then what should we more
wish for? we have store of powerful [[friends]]; if nothing else offer, and
we be in much haste, at least a presidentship may be given us: and a
wife with some [[money]], that she increase not our charges: and this shall
be the bound of [[desire]]. many [[great]] [[men]], and most worthy of imitation,
have given themselves to the study of [[wisdom]] in the [[state]] of [[marriage]]."

while i went over these things, and these winds shifted and drove my
heart this way and that, [[time]] passed on, but i delayed to turn to the
lord; and from day to day deferred to [[live]] in thee, and deferred not
daily to [[die]] in myself. loving a [[happy]] [[life]], i feared it in its own
abode, and sought it, by fleeing from it. i [[thought]] i should be too
miserable, unless folded in female arms; and of the medicine of thy
mercy to cure that infirmity i [[thought]] not, not having tried it. as for
continency, i supposed it to be in our own [[power]] (though in myself i did
not find that power), being so foolish as not to [[know]] what is written,
none can be continent unless thou give it; and that thou wouldest give
it, if with inward groanings i did knock at thine ears, and with a
settled [[faith]] did cast my [[care]] on thee.

alypius indeed kept me from marrying; alleging that so could we by no
means with undistracted leisure [[live]] together in the [[love]] of [[wisdom]], as
we had long [[desired]]. for himself was even then most pure in this point,
so that it was wonderful; and that the more, since in the outset of his
youth he had entered into that course, but had not stuck fast therein;
rather had he [[felt]] remorse and revolting at it, living thenceforth until
now most continently. but i opposed him with the examples [[example]] of those who
as [[married]] [[men]] had cherished [[wisdom]], and served [[god]] acceptably, and
retained their [[friends]], and loved them faithfully. of whose greatness of
spirit i was far short; and bound with the disease of the flesh, and its
deadly sweetness, drew along my chain, dreading to be loosed, and as if
my wound had been fretted, put back his [[good]] persuasions, as it were the
hand of one that would unchain me. moreover, by me did the serpent
speak unto alypius himself, by my tongue weaving and laying in his
path pleasurable snares, wherein his [[virtuous]] and [[free]] feet might be
entangled.

for when he wondered that i, whom he esteemed not slightly, should stick
so fast in the birdlime of that [[pleasure]], as to [[protest]] (so oft as we
discussed it) that i could never lead a [[single]] [[life]]; and urged in my
defence when i saw him wonder, that there was [[great]] difference between
his momentary and scarce-remembered [[knowledge]] of that [[life]], which so
he might easily despise, and my continued acquaintance whereto if the
honourable name of [[marriage]] were added, he ought not to wonder why i
could not contemn that course; he began also to [[desire]] to be [[married]];
not as overcome with [[desire]] of such [[pleasure]], but out of curiosity. for
he would fain [[know]], he said, what that should be, without which my [[life]],
to him so pleasing, would to me seem not [[life]] but a [[punishment]]. for his
mind, [[free]] from that chain, was amazed at my thraldom; and through that
amazement was going on to a [[desire]] of trying it, thence to the trial
itself, and thence perhaps to sink into that bondage whereat he
wondered, seeing he was willing to make a covenant with [[death]]; and he
that loves [[love]] danger, shall fall into it. for whatever [[honour]] there be in
the office of well-ordering a [[married]] [[life]], and a [[family]], moved us but
slightly. but me for the most part the habit of satisfying an insatiable
appetite tormented, while it held me captive; him, an admiring wonder
was leading captive. so were we, until thou, o most high, not forsaking
our dust, commiserating us miserable, didst come to our [[help]], by
wondrous and secret ways.

continual effort was made to have me [[married]]. i wooed, i was
promised, chiefly through my mother's pains [[pain]], that so once [[married]], the
health-giving baptism might cleanse me, towards which she rejoiced
that i was being daily fitted, and observed that her prayers, and thy
promises, were being fulfilled in my [[faith]]. at which [[time]] verily, both
at my request and her own longing, with [[strong]] cries of [[heart]] she
daily begged of thee, that thou wouldest by a vision discover unto her
something concerning my future [[marriage]]; thou never wouldest. she saw
indeed [[certain]] [[vain]] and fantastic things, such as the energy of the
human spirit, busied thereon, brought together; and these she told me
of, not with that confidence she was wont, when thou showedst her any
thing, but slighting them. for she could, she said, through a certain
feeling, which in words she could not express, discern betwixt thy
revelations, and the dreams [[dream]] of her own [[soul]]. yet the matter was pressed
on, and a maiden [[asked]] in [[marriage]], two years under the fit [[age]]; and, as
pleasing, was waited for.

and many of us [[friends]] conferring about, and detesting the turbulent
turmoils of [[human]] [[life]], had debated and now almost resolved on living
apart from [[business]] and the bustle of [[men]]; and this was to be thus
obtained; we were to bring whatever we might severally procure, and
make one household of all; so that through the [[truth]] of our friendship
nothing should belong especially to any; but the whole thus derived from
all, should as a whole belong to each, and all to all. we [[thought]] there
might be some often persons [[person]] in this [[society]]; some of whom were very
rich, especially romanianus our townsman, from [[childhood]] a very familiar
friend of mine, whom the grievous perplexities of his affairs had
brought up to court; who was the most earnest for this project; and
therein was his voice of [[great]] weight, because his ample estate far
exceeded any of the rest. we had settled also that two annual officers,
as it were, should provide all things necessary, the rest being
undisturbed. but when we began to consider whether the wives [[wife]], which
some of us already had, others hoped to have, would allow this, all that
plan, which was being so well moulded, fell to pieces in our hands, was
utterly dashed and cast aside. thence we betook us to sighs, and groans,
and our steps to [[follow]] the broad and beaten ways of the [[world]]; for many
thoughts were in our [[heart]], but thy counsel standeth for ever. out
of which counsel thou didst deride ours, and preparedst thine own;
purposing to give us meat in due season, and to fill our souls [[soul]] with
blessing.

meanwhile my sins [[sin]] were being multiplied, and my concubine being torn
from my side as a hindrance to my [[marriage]], my [[heart]] which clave unto
her was torn and wounded and bleeding. and she returned to afric, vowing
unto thee never to [[know]] any other [[man]], leaving with me my [[son]] by her.
but unhappy i, who could not imitate a very woman, impatient of delay,
inasmuch as not till after two years was i to obtain her i sought not
being so much a lover of [[marriage]] as a [[slave]] to [[lust]], procured another,
though no [[wife]], that so by the servitude of an enduring custom, the
disease of my [[soul]] might be kept up and carried on in its vigour, or
even augmented, into the dominion of [[marriage]]. nor was that my wound
cured, which had been made by the cutting away of the former, but after
inflammation and most acute [[pain]], it mortified, and my pains [[pain]] became less
acute, but more desperate.

to thee be [[praise]], [[glory]] to thee, fountain of mercies. i was becoming
more miserable, and thou nearer. thy [[right]] hand was continually ready to
pluck me out of the mire, and to wash me thoroughly, and i knew it
not; nor did anything call me back from a yet deeper gulf of carnal
pleasures, but the [[fear]] of [[death]], and of thy [[judgment]] to come; which
amid all my changes [[change]], never departed from my breast. and in my disputes
with my [[friends]] alypius and nebridius of the [[nature]] of [[good]] and [[evil]], i
held that epicurus had in my [[mind]] won the palm, had i not believed that
after [[death]] there remained a [[life]] for the [[soul]], and places of requital
according to men's deserts, which epicurus would not [[believe]]. and i
asked, "were we [[immortal]], and to [[live]] in perpetual bodily [[pleasure]],
without [[fear]] of losing it, why should we not be [[happy]], or what else
should we seek?" not knowing that [[great]] misery was involved in this very
thing, that, being thus sunk and blinded, i could not discern that light
of excellence and [[beauty]], to be embraced for its own sake, which the eye
of flesh cannot see, and is seen by the inner [[man]]. nor did i, unhappy,
consider from what source it sprung, that even on these things, foul as
they were, i with [[pleasure]] discoursed with my [[friends]], nor could i,
even according to the notions i then had of [[happiness]], be [[happy]] without
friends, amid what abundance soever of carnal pleasures [[pleasure]]. and yet these
friends i loved for themselves only, and i [[felt]] that i was beloved of
them again for myself only.

o crooked paths! woe to the audacious [[soul]], which hoped, by forsaking
thee, to gain some [[better]] thing! turned it hath, and turned again, upon
back, sides, and belly, yet all was painful; and thou alone rest.
and behold, thou art [[arts]] at hand, and deliverest us from our wretched
wanderings, and placest us in thy way, and dost comfort us, and say,
"run; i will carry you; yea i will bring you through; there also will i
carry you."




book vii


deceased was now that my [[evil]] and abominable [[youth]], and i was passing
into early manhood; the more defiled by [[vain]] things as i grew in years,
who could not imagine any substance, but such as is wont to be seen with
these [[eyes]]. i [[thought]] not of thee, o [[god]], under the figure of a human
body; since i began to hear aught of [[wisdom]], i always avoided this; and
rejoiced to have found the same in the [[faith]] of our [[spiritual]] [[mother]],
thy catholic [[church]]. but what else to conceive of thee i knew not. and
i, a [[man]], and such a [[man]], sought to conceive of thee the [[sovereign]],
only, true [[god]]; and i did in my inmost [[soul]] [[believe]] that thou wert
incorruptible, and uninjurable, and unchangeable; because though not
knowing whence or how, yet i saw plainly, and was sure, that that which
may be corrupted must be inferior to that which cannot; what could not
be injured i preferred unhesitatingly to what could receive injury; the
unchangeable to things [[subject]] to [[change]]. my [[heart]] passionately cried
out against all my phantoms, and with this one blow i sought to beat
away from the eye of my [[mind]] all that unclean troop which buzzed around
it. and lo, being scarce put off, in the twinkling of an eye they
gathered again thick about me, flew against my face, and beclouded
it; so that though not under the form of the [[human]] [[body]], yet was i
constrained to conceive of thee (that incorruptible, uninjurable, and
unchangeable, which i preferred before the corruptible, and injurable,
and changeable) as being in space, whether infused into the [[world]], or
diffused infinitely without it. because whatsoever i conceived, deprived
of this space, seemed to me nothing, yea altogether nothing, not even
a void, as if a [[body]] were taken out of its place, and the place should
remain empty of any [[body]] at all, of [[earth]] and water, air and [[heaven]], yet
would it remain a void place, as it were a spacious nothing.

i then being thus gross-hearted, nor clear even to myself, whatsoever
was not extended over [[certain]] spaces, nor diffused, nor condensed, nor
swelled out, or did not or could not receive some of these dimensions,
i [[thought]] to be altogether nothing. for over such forms as my [[eyes]] are
wont to range, did my [[heart]] then range: nor yet did i see that this same
notion of the [[mind]], whereby i formed those very images, was not of this
sort, and yet it could not have formed them, had not itself been some
great thing. so also did i endeavour to conceive of thee, [[life]] of my
life, as vast, through infinite spaces on every side penetrating
the whole mass of the [[universe]], and beyond it, every way, through
unmeasurable boundless spaces; so that the [[earth]] should have thee, the
heaven have thee, all things have thee, and they be bounded in thee, and
thou bounded nowhere. for that as the [[body]] of this air which is above
the [[earth]], hindereth not the [[light]] of the sun from passing through it,
penetrating it, not by bursting or by cutting, but by filling it wholly:
so i [[thought]] the [[body]] not of [[heaven]], air, and sea only, but of the earth
too, pervious to thee, so that in all its parts, the [[greatest]] as the
smallest, it should admit thy presence, by a secret inspiration, within
and without, directing all things which thou hast created. so i guessed,
only as unable to conceive aught else, for it was false. for thus should
a greater part of the [[earth]] contain a greater portion of thee, and a
less, a lesser: and all things should in such sort be full of thee,
that the [[body]] of an elephant should contain more of thee, than that of
a sparrow, by how much larger it is, and takes up more room; and thus
shouldest thou make the several portions of thyself [[present]] unto the
several portions of the [[world]], in fragments, large to the large,
petty to the petty. but such art [[arts]] not thou. but not as yet hadst thou
enlightened my darkness.

it was enough for me, [[lord]], to oppose to those deceived deceivers, and
dumb praters, since thy word sounded not out of them;--that was enough
which long ago, while we were yet at [[carthage]], nebridius used to
propound, at which all we that heard it were staggered: "that said
nation of darkness, which the manichees are wont to set as an opposing
mass over against thee, what could it have done unto thee, hadst thou
refused to [[fight]] with it? for, if they answered, 'it would have
done thee some hurt,' then shouldest thou be [[subject]] to injury and
corruption: but it could do thee no hurt,' then was no [[reason]] brought
for thy fighting with it; and fighting in such [[wise]], as that a certain
portion or member of thee, or offspring of thy very substance, should be
mingled with opposed powers [[power]], and natures [[nature]] not created by thee, and be
by them so far corrupted and changed to the worse, as to be turned
from [[happiness]] into misery, and need assistance, whereby it might be
extricated and purified; and that this offspring of thy substance was
the [[soul]], which being enthralled, defiled, corrupted, thy word, [[free]],
pure, and whole, might relieve; that word itself being still corruptible
because it was of one and the same substance. so then, should they
affirm thee, whatsoever thou art [[arts]], that is, thy substance whereby
thou art [[arts]], to be incorruptible, then were all these sayings false and
execrable; but if corruptible, the very statement showed it to be false
and revolting." this argument then of nebridius sufficed against those
who deserved wholly to be vomited out of the overcharged stomach; for
they had no escape, without horrible blasphemy of [[heart]] and tongue, thus
thinking and speaking of thee.

but i also as yet, although i held and was firmly persuaded that thou
our [[lord]] the true [[god]], who madest not only our souls [[soul]], but our bodies [[body]],
and not only our souls [[soul]] and bodies [[body]], but all beings, and all things, wert
undefilable and unalterable, and in no [[degree]] mutable; yet understood i
not, clearly and without difficulty, the cause of [[evil]]. and yet whatever
it were, i perceived it was in such [[wise]] to be sought out, as should not
constrain me to [[believe]] the immutable [[god]] to be mutable, lest i should
become that [[evil]] i was seeking out. i sought it out then, thus far free
from [[anxiety]], [[certain]] of the untruth of what these held, from whom i
shrunk with my whole [[heart]]: for i saw, that through enquiring the origin
of [[evil]], they were filled with [[evil]], in that they preferred to think
that thy substance did suffer ill than their own did commit it.

and i strained to perceive what i now heard, that free-will was the
cause of our doing ill, and thy just [[judgment]] of our suffering ill. but
i was not able clearly to discern it. so then endeavouring to draw my
soul's vision out of that deep pit, i was again plunged therein, and
endeavouring often, i was plunged back as often. but this raised me a
little into thy [[light]], that i knew as well that i had a will, as that i
lived: when then i did will or nill any thing, i was most sure that no
other than myself did will and nill: and i all but saw that there
was the cause of my [[sin]]. but what i did against my will, i saw that
i [[suffered]] rather than did, and i judged not to be my [[fault]], but my
punishment; whereby, however, holding thee to be just, i speedily
confessed myself to be not unjustly punished. but again i said, who made
me? did not my [[god]], who is not only [[good]], but goodness itself? whence
then came i to will [[evil]] and nill [[good]], so that i am thus justly
punished? who set this in me, and ingrafted into me this plant of
bitterness, seeing i was wholly formed by my most sweet [[god]]? if the
devil were the author, whence is that same [[devil]]? and if he also by his
own perverse will, of a [[good]] angel became a [[devil]], whence, again, came
in him that [[evil]] will whereby he became a [[devil]], seeing the whole nature
of angels was made by that most [[good]] creator? by these thoughts [[thought]] i was
again sunk down and choked; yet not brought down to that hell of error
(where no [[man]] confesseth unto thee), to [[think]] rather that thou dost
suffer ill, than that [[man]] doth it.

for i was in such [[wise]] striving to find out the rest, as one who had
already found that the incorruptible must needs be [[better]] than the
corruptible: and thee therefore, whatsoever thou wert, i confessed to
be incorruptible. for never [[soul]] was, nor shall be, able to conceive any
thing which may be [[better]] than thou, who art [[arts]] the [[sovereign]] and the
best [[good]]. but since most truly and certainly, the incorruptible is
preferable to the corruptible (as i did now prefer it), then, wert thou
not incorruptible, i could in [[thought]] have arrived at something better
than my [[god]]. where then i saw the incorruptible to be preferable to the
corruptible, there ought i to seek for thee, and there observe "wherein
evil itself was"; that is, whence [[corruption]] comes, by which thy
substance can by no means be impaired. for [[corruption]] does no ways
impair our [[god]]; by no will, by no necessity, by no unlooked-for [[chance]]:
because he is [[god]], and what he wills is [[good]], and himself is that
good; but to be corrupted is not [[good]]. nor art [[arts]] thou against thy will
constrained to any thing, since thy will is not greater than thy [[power]].
but greater should it be, were thyself greater than thyself. for the
will and [[power]] of [[god]] is [[god]] himself. and what can be unlooked-for by
thee, who knowest all things? nor is there any [[nature]] in things, but
thou knowest it. and what should we more say, "why that substance which
god is should not be corruptible," seeing if it were so, it should not
be [[god]]?

and i sought "whence is [[evil]]," and sought in an [[evil]] way; and saw not
the [[evil]] in my very search. i set now before the sight of my spirit
the whole creation, whatsoever we can see therein (as sea, [[earth]], air,
stars, trees, mortal creatures); yea, and whatever in it we do not see,
as the firmament of [[heaven]], all angels moreover, and all the spiritual
inhabitants thereof. but these very beings, as though they were
bodies, did my fancy dispose in place, and i made one [[great]] mass of thy
creation, distinguished as to the kinds [[kind]] of bodies [[body]]; some, real bodies [[body]],
some, what myself had feigned for spirits. and this mass i made huge,
not as it was (which i could not know), but as i [[thought]] convenient, yet
every way finite. but thee, o [[lord]], i imagined on every part environing
and penetrating it, though every way infinite: as if there were a sea,
every where, and on every side, through unmeasured space, one only
boundless sea, and it contained within it some sponge, huge, but
bounded; that sponge must needs, in all its parts, be filled from that
unmeasurable sea: so conceived i thy creation, itself finite, full of
thee, the infinite; and i said, behold [[god]], and behold what [[god]] hath
created; and [[god]] is [[good]], yea, most mightily and incomparably better
than all these: but yet he, the [[good]], created them [[good]]; and see how
he environeth and fulfils them. where is [[evil]] then, and whence, and how
crept it in hither? what is its root, and what its seed? or hath it no
being? why then [[fear]] we and avoid what is not? or if we [[fear]] it idly,
then is that very [[fear]] [[evil]], whereby the [[soul]] is thus idly goaded and
racked. yea, and so much a greater [[evil]], as we have nothing to [[fear]], and
yet do [[fear]]. therefore either is that [[evil]] which we [[fear]], or else evil
is, that we [[fear]]. whence is it then? seeing [[god]], the [[good]], hath created
all these things [[good]]. he indeed, the greater and chiefest [[good]], hath
created these lesser goods [[good]]; still both creator and created, all are
good. whence is [[evil]]? or, was there some [[evil]] matter of which he made,
and formed, and ordered it, yet left something in it which he did not
convert into [[good]]? why so then? had he no might to turn and [[change]] the
whole, so that no [[evil]] should remain in it, seeing he is all-mighty?
lastly, why would he make any thing at all of it, and not rather by
the same all-mightiness cause it not to be at all? or, could it then be
against his will? or if it were from eternity, why [[suffered]] he it so to
be for infinite spaces of times [[time]] [[past]], and was pleased so long after to
make something out of it? or if he were suddenly pleased now to effect
somewhat, this rather should the all-mighty have effected, that this
evil matter should not be, and he alone be, the whole, true, [[sovereign]],
and infinite [[good]]. or if it was not [[good]] that he who was [[good]] should not
also frame and create something that were [[good]], then, that [[evil]] matter
being taken away and brought to nothing, he might form [[good]] matter,
whereof to create all things. for he should not be all-mighty, if he
might not create something [[good]] without the aid of that matter which
himself had not created. these thoughts [[thought]] i revolved in my miserable
heart, overcharged with most gnawing cares [[care]], lest i should [[die]] ere i had
found the [[truth]]; yet was the [[faith]] of thy [[christ]], our [[lord]] and saviour,
professed in the [[church]] catholic, firmly fixed in my [[heart]], in many
points, indeed, as yet unformed, and fluctuating from the [[rule]] of
doctrine; yet did not my [[mind]] utterly leave it, but rather daily took in
more and more of it.

by this [[time]] also had i rejected the lying divinations and impious
dotages of the astrologers. let thine own mercies, out of my very
inmost [[soul]], confess unto thee for this also, o my [[god]]. for thou, thou
altogether (for who else calls us back from the [[death]] of all errors,
save the [[life]] which cannot [[die]], and the [[wisdom]] which needing no light
enlightens the minds [[mind]] that need it, whereby the [[universe]] is directed,
down to the whirling leaves of trees?)--thou madest provision for my
obstinacy wherewith i struggled against vindicianus, an acute old [[man]],
and nebridius, a [[young]] [[man]] of admirable [[talents]]; the first vehemently
affirming, and the latter often (though with some doubtfulness) saying,
"that there was no such art [[arts]] whereby to foresee things to come, but that
men's conjectures were a sort of lottery, and that out of many things
which they said should come to pass, some actually did, unawares to them
who spake it, who stumbled upon it, through their oft speaking."
thou providedst then a friend for me, no negligent consulter of the
astrologers; nor yet well skilled in those [[arts]], but (as i said) a
curious consulter with them, and yet knowing something, which he said
he had heard of his [[father]], which how far it went to overthrow the
estimation of that art [[arts]], he knew not. this [[man]] then, firminus by name,
having had a liberal [[education]], and well taught in rhetoric, consulted
me, as one very dear to him, what, according to his so-called
constellations, i [[thought]] on [[certain]] affairs of his, wherein his worldly
hopes had risen, and i, who had herein now begun to incline towards
nebridius' [[opinion]], did not altogether refuse to conjecture, and tell
him what came into my unresolved [[mind]]; but added, that i was now almost
persuaded that these were but empty and ridiculous follies. thereupon he
told me that his [[father]] had been very [[curious]] in such books [[book]], and had
a friend as earnest in them as himself, who with joint study and
conference fanned the flame of their affections to these toys, so that
they would observe the moments whereat the very dumb animals, which bred
about their houses, gave birth, and then observed the relative position
of the heavens [[heaven]], thereby to make fresh experiments in this so-called art [[arts]].
he said then that he had heard of his [[father]], that what [[time]] his mother
was about to give birth to him, firminus, a woman-servant of that friend
of his father's was also with child, which could not escape her master,
who took [[care]] with most exact diligence to [[know]] the births of his very
puppies. and so it was that (the one for his [[wife]], and the other for his
servant, with the most careful observation, reckoning days, hours,
nay, the lesser divisions of the hours) both were delivered at the same
instant; so that both were constrained to allow the same constellations,
even to the minutest points, the one for his [[son]], the other for his
new-born [[slave]]. for so soon as the [[women]] began to be in [[labour]], they
each gave notice to the other what was fallen out in their houses, and
had messengers ready to send to one another so soon as they had notice
of the actual birth, of which they had easily provided, each in his own
province, to give instant [[intelligence]]. thus then the messengers of
the respective parties met, he averred, at such an [[equal]] distance from
either house that neither of them could make out any difference in the
position of the stars, or any other minutest points; and yet firminus,
born in a high estate in his parents' house, ran his course through
the gilded paths of [[life]], was increased in riches [[rich]], raised to honours [[honour]];
whereas that [[slave]] continued to serve his masters, without any
relaxation of his yoke, as firminus, who knew him, told me.

upon hearing and believing these things, told by one of such
credibility, all that my [[resistance]] gave way; and first i endeavoured to
reclaim firminus himself from that curiosity, by telling him that upon
inspecting his constellations, i ought if i were to predict truly, to
have seen in them parents eminent among their neighbours, a [[noble]] family
in its own [[city]], high birth, [[good]] [[education]], liberal learning. but if
that servant had consulted me upon the same constellations, since they
were his also, i ought again (to tell him too truly) to see in them
a lineage the most abject, a slavish condition, and every thing else
utterly at variance with the former. whence then, if i spake the [[truth]],
i should, from the same constellations, speak diversely, or if i
spake the same, speak falsely: thence it followed most certainly that
whatever, upon consideration of the constellations, was spoken truly,
was spoken not out of art [[arts]], but [[chance]]; and whatever spoken falsely, was
not out of ignorance in the art [[arts]], but the failure of the [[chance]].

an opening thus made, ruminating with myself on the like things, that
no one of those dotards (who lived by such a [[trade]], and whom i longed
to attack, and with derision to confute) might urge against me that
firminus had informed me falsely, or his [[father]] him; i bent my thoughts
on those that are born twins, who for the most part come out of the womb
so near one to other, that the small interval (how much [[force]] soever
in the [[nature]] of things folk may pretend it to have) cannot be noted
by [[human]] observation, or be at all expressed in those figures which the
astrologer is to inspect, that he may pronounce truly. yet they cannot
be true: for looking into the same figures, he must have predicted the
same of esau and jacob, whereas the same happened not to them. therefore
he must speak falsely; or if truly, then, looking into the same figures,
he must not give the same [[answer]]. not by art [[arts]], then, but by [[chance]], would
he speak truly. for thou, o [[lord]], most righteous ruler of the [[universe]],
while consulters and consulted [[know]] it not, dost by thy hidden
inspiration effect that the consulter should hear what, according to the
hidden deservings of souls [[soul]], he ought to hear, out of the unsearchable
depth of thy just [[judgment]], to whom let no [[man]] say, what is this? why
that? let him not so say, for he is [[man]].

now then, o my helper, hadst thou loosed me from those fetters: and i
sought "whence is [[evil]]," and found no way. but thou sufferedst me not by
any fluctuations of [[thought]] to be carried away from the [[faith]] whereby i
believed thee both to be, and thy substance to be unchangeable, and that
thou hast a [[care]] of, and wouldest [[judge]] [[men]], and that in [[christ]], thy
son, our [[lord]], and the holy scriptures [[scripture]], which the [[authority]] of thy
catholic [[church]] pressed upon me, thou hadst set the way of man's
salvation, to that [[life]] which is to be after this [[death]]. these things
being safe and immovably settled in my [[mind]], i sought anxiously "whence
was [[evil]]?" what were the pangs of my teeming [[heart]], what groans, o my
god! yet even there were thine ears open, and i knew it not; and when
in [[silence]] i vehemently sought, those silent contritions of my [[soul]] were
strong cries unto thy [[mercy]]. thou knewest what i [[suffered]], and no [[man]].
for, what was that which was thence through my tongue distilled into the
ears of my most familiar [[friends]]? did the whole tumult of my [[soul]], for
which neither [[time]] nor utterance sufficed, reach them? yet went up the
whole to thy hearing, all which i roared out from the groanings of my
heart; and my [[desire]] was before thee, and the [[light]] of mine [[eyes]] was not
with me: for that was within, i without: nor was that confined to place,
but i was intent on things contained in place, but there found i no
resting-place, nor did they so receive me, that i could say, "it is
enough," "it is well": nor did they yet suffer me to turn back, where
it might be well enough with me. for to these things was i superior, but
inferior to thee; and thou art [[arts]] my true joy when subjected to thee, and
thou hadst subjected to me what thou createdst below me. and this was
the true temperament, and middle region of my safety, to remain in
thy image, and by serving thee, [[rule]] the [[body]]. but when i rose proudly
against thee, and ran against the [[lord]] with my neck, with the thick
bosses of my buckler, even these inferior things were set above me, and
pressed me down, and no where was there respite or space of breathing.
they met my sight on all sides by heaps and [[troops]], and in [[thought]] the
images thereof presented themselves unsought, as i would return to
thee, as if they would say unto me, "whither goest thou, unworthy
and defiled?" and these things had grown out of my wound; for thou
"humbledst the proud like one that is wounded," and through my own
swelling was i separated from thee; yea, my pride-swollen face closed up
mine [[eyes]].

but thou, [[lord]], abidest for ever, yet not for ever art [[arts]] thou angry with
us; because thou pitiest our dust and ashes, and it was pleasing in thy
sight to reform my deformities; and by inward goads didst thou rouse me,
that i should be ill at ease, until thou wert manifested to my inward
sight. thus, by the secret hand of thy medicining was my swelling
abated, and the troubled and bedimmed eyesight of my [[mind]], by the
smarting anointings of healthful sorrows [[sorrow]], was from day to day healed.

and thou, willing first to show me how thou resistest the proud, but
givest grace unto the humble, and by how [[great]] an act of thy [[mercy]] thou
hadst traced out to [[men]] the way of [[humility]], in that thy word was made
flesh, and dwelt among [[men]]:--thou procuredst for me, by means of one
puffed up with most unnatural [[pride]], [[certain]] books [[book]] of the platonists,
translated from [[greek]] into latin. and therein i [[read]], not indeed in the
very words, but to the very same [[purpose]], enforced by many and divers
reasons, that in the beginning was the word, and the word was with [[god]],
and the word was [[god]]: the same was in the beginning with [[god]]: all things
were made by him, and without him was nothing made: that which was made
by him is [[life]], and the [[life]] was the [[light]] of [[men]], and the [[light]] shineth
in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. and that the soul
of [[man]], though it bears witness to the [[light]], yet itself is not that
light; but the word of [[god]], being [[god]], is that true [[light]] that lighteth
every [[man]] that cometh into the [[world]]. and that he was in the [[world]], and
the [[world]] was made by him, and the [[world]] knew him not. but, that he came
unto his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him,
to them gave he [[power]] to become the sons [[son]] of [[god]], as many as believed in
his name; this i [[read]] not there.

again i [[read]] there, that [[god]] the word was born not of flesh nor of
blood, nor of the will of [[man]], nor of the will of the flesh, but of [[god]].
but that the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, i [[read]] not there.
for i traced in those books [[book]] that it was many and divers ways said, that
the [[son]] was in the form of the [[father]], and [[thought]] it not robbery to be
equal with [[god]], for that naturally he was the same substance. but that
he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the
likeness of [[men]], and found in [[fashion]] as a [[man]], humbled himself, and
became [[obedient]] unto [[death]], and that the [[death]] of the cross: wherefore
god exalted him from the [[dead]], and gave him a name above every name,
that at the name of [[jesus]] every knee should how, of things in [[heaven]],
and things in [[earth]], and things under the [[earth]]; and that every tongue
should confess that the [[lord]] [[jesus]] [[christ]] is in the [[glory]] of [[god]] the
father; those books [[book]] have not. for that before all times [[time]] and above all
times thy only-begotten [[son]] remaineth unchangeable, co-eternal with
thee, and that of his fulness souls [[soul]] receive, that they may be blessed;
and that by participation of [[wisdom]] abiding in them, they are renewed,
so as to be [[wise]], is there. but that in due [[time]] he died for the
ungodly; and that thou sparedst not thine only [[son]], but deliveredst him
for us all, is not there. for thou hiddest these things from the [[wise]],
and revealedst them to babes; that they that [[labour]] and are heavy laden
might come unto him, and he refresh them, because he is meek and lowly
in [[heart]]; and the meek he directeth in [[judgment]], and the gentle he
teacheth his ways, beholding our lowliness and trouble, and forgiving
all our sins [[sin]]. but such as are lifted up in the lofty walk of some
would-be sublimer learning, hear not him, saying, learn of me, for i am
meek and lowly in [[heart]], and ye shall find rest to your souls [[soul]]. although
they knew [[god]], yet they glorify him not as [[god]], nor are thankful,
but wax [[vain]] in their thoughts [[thought]]; and their foolish [[heart]] is darkened;
professing that they were [[wise]], they became fools [[fool]].

and therefore did i [[read]] there also, that they had changed the [[glory]] of
thy incorruptible [[nature]] into idols and divers shapes, into the likeness
of the image of corruptible [[man]], and birds, and beasts, and creeping
things; namely, into that egyptian food for which esau lost his
birthright, for that thy first-born [[people]] worshipped the head of a
four-footed beast instead of thee; turning in [[heart]] back towards [[egypt]];
and bowing thy image, their own [[soul]], before the image of a calf that
eateth hay. these things found i here, but i fed not on them. for it
pleased thee, o [[lord]], to take away the reproach of diminution from
jacob, that the elder should serve the younger: and thou calledst the
gentiles into thine [[inheritance]]. and i had come to thee from among the
gentiles; and i set my [[mind]] upon the gold which thou willedst thy people
to take from [[egypt]], seeing thine it was, wheresoever it were. and to the
athenians thou saidst by thy apostle, that in thee we [[live]], move, and
have our being, as one of their own poets had said. and verily these
books came from thence. but i set not my [[mind]] on the idols of [[egypt]],
whom they served with thy gold, who changed the [[truth]] of [[god]] into a [[lie]],
and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator.

and being thence admonished to return to myself, i entered even into my
inward [[self]], thou being my guide: and able i was, for thou wert become
my helper. and i entered and beheld with the eye of my [[soul]] (such as
it was), above the same eye of my [[soul]], above my [[mind]], the light
unchangeable. not this ordinary [[light]], which all flesh may look upon,
nor as it were a greater of the same [[kind]], as though the brightness of
this should be manifold brighter, and with its greatness take up all
space. not such was this [[light]], but other, yea, far other from these.
nor was it above my [[soul]], as [[oil]] is above water, nor yet as [[heaven]] above
earth: but above to my [[soul]], because it made me; and i below it, because
i was made by it. he that knows [[know]] the [[truth]], knows [[know]] what that [[light]] is;
and he that knows [[know]] it, knows [[know]] eternity. [[love]] knoweth it. o [[truth]] who art
eternity! and [[love]] who art [[arts]] truth! and eternity who art [[arts]] love! thou art
my [[god]], to thee do i sigh night and day. thee when i first knew, thou
liftedst me up, that i might see there was what i might see, and that i
was not yet such as to see. and thou didst beat back the weakness of my
sight, streaming forth thy beams of [[light]] upon me most strongly, and i
trembled with [[love]] and awe: and i perceived myself to be far off from
thee, in the region of unlikeness, as if i heard this thy voice from on
high: "i am the food of grown [[men]], grow, and thou shalt feed upon me;
nor shalt thou convert me, like the food of thy flesh into thee, but
thou shalt be converted into me." and i learned, that thou for iniquity
chastenest [[man]], and thou madest my [[soul]] to consume away like a spider.
and i said, "is [[truth]] therefore nothing because it is not diffused
through space finite or infinite?" and thou criedst to me from afar:
"yet verily, i am that i am." and i heard, as the [[heart]] heareth, nor had
i room to [[doubt]], and i should sooner [[doubt]] that i [[live]] than that truth
is not, which is clearly seen, being understood by those things which
are made. and i beheld the other things below thee, and i perceived that
they neither altogether are, nor altogether are not, for they are, since
they are from thee, but are not, because they are not what thou art [[arts]]. for
that truly is which remains unchangeably. it is [[good]] then for me to hold
fast unto [[god]]; for if i remain not in him, i cannot in myself; but he
remaining in himself, reneweth all things. and thou art [[arts]] the [[lord]] my [[god]],
since thou standest not in need of my goodness.

and it was manifested unto me, that those things be [[good]] which yet are
corrupted; which neither were they sovereignly [[good]], nor unless they
were [[good]] could be corrupted: for if sovereignly [[good]], they were
incorruptible, if not [[good]] at all, there were nothing in them to be
corrupted. for [[corruption]] injures, but unless it diminished goodness, it
could not injure. either then [[corruption]] injures not, which cannot be;
or which is most [[certain]], all which is corrupted is deprived of [[good]].
but if they be deprived of all [[good]], they shall cease to be. for if they
shall be, and can now no longer be corrupted, they shall be [[better]] than
before, because they shall abide incorruptibly. and what more monstrous
than to affirm things to become [[better]] by losing all their [[good]]?
therefore, if they shall be deprived of all [[good]], they shall no longer
be. so long therefore as they are, they are [[good]]: therefore whatsoever
is, is [[good]]. that [[evil]] then which i sought, whence it is, is not any
substance: for were it a substance, it should be [[good]]. for either
it should be an incorruptible substance, and so a [[chief]] [[good]]: or
a corruptible substance; which unless it were [[good]], could not be
corrupted. i perceived therefore, and it was manifested to me that thou
madest all things [[good]], nor is there any substance at all, which thou
madest not; and for that thou madest not all things [[equal]], therefore are
all things; because each is [[good]], and altogether very [[good]], because our
god made all things very [[good]].

and to thee is nothing whatsoever [[evil]]: yea, not only to thee, but also
to thy creation as a whole, because there is nothing without, which may
break in, and [[corrupt]] that order which thou hast appointed it. but in
the parts thereof some things, because unharmonising with other some,
are accounted [[evil]]: whereas those very things harmonise with others,
and are [[good]]; and in themselves are [[good]]. and all these things which
harmonise not together, do yet with the inferior part, which we call
earth, having its own cloudy and windy [[sky]] harmonising with it. far be
it then that i should say, "these things should not be": for should i
see nought but these, i should indeed long for the [[better]]; but still
must even for these alone [[praise]] thee; for that thou art [[arts]] to be praised,
do show from the [[earth]], dragons, and all deeps, [[fire]], hail, snow,
ice, and stormy wind, which fulfil thy word; mountains, and all hills,
fruitful trees, and all cedars; beasts, and all cattle, creeping things,
and flying fowls; kings [[king]] of the [[earth]], and all [[people]], princes [[prince]], and all
judges of the [[earth]]; [[young]] [[men]] and maidens, old [[men]] and [[young]], praise
thy name. but when, from [[heaven]], these [[praise]] thee, [[praise]] thee, our
god, in the heights all thy angels, all thy hosts, sun and moon, all the
stars and [[light]], the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]], and the waters that be above the
heavens, [[praise]] thy name; i did not now long for things [[better]], because
i conceived of all: and with a sounder [[judgment]] i apprehended that the
things above were [[better]] than these below, but altogether [[better]] than
those above by themselves.

there is no soundness in them, whom aught of thy creation displeaseth:
as neither in me, when much which thou hast made, displeased me. and
because my [[soul]] durst not be displeased at my [[god]], it would fain not
account that thine, which displeased it. hence it had gone into the
opinion of two substances, and had no rest, but talked idly. and
returning thence, it had made to itself a [[god]], through infinite measures
of all space; and [[thought]] it to be thee, and placed it in its [[heart]];
and had again become the temple of its own idol, to thee abominable. but
after thou hadst soothed my head, unknown to me, and closed mine eyes
that they should not behold vanity, i ceased somewhat of my former [[self]],
and my frenzy was lulled to sleep; and i awoke in thee, and saw thee
infinite, but in another way, and this sight was not derived from the
flesh.

and i looked back on other things; and i saw that they owed their being
to thee; and were all bounded in thee: but in a different way; not as
being in space; but because thou containest all things in thine hand
in thy [[truth]]; and all things are true so far as they nor is there any
falsehood, unless when that is [[thought]] to be, which is not. and i saw
that all things did harmonise, not with their places only, but with
their seasons. and that thou, who only art [[arts]] eternal, didst not begin to
work after innumerable spaces of times [[time]] spent; for that all spaces of
times, both which have passed, and which shall pass, neither go nor
come, but through thee, working and abiding.

and i perceived and found it nothing [[strange]], that bread which is
pleasant to a healthy palate is loathsome to one distempered: and to
sore [[eyes]] [[light]] is offensive, which to the sound is delightful. and thy
righteousness displeaseth the wicked; much more the viper and reptiles,
which thou hast created [[good]], fitting in with the inferior portions of
thy creation, with which the very wicked also fit in; and that the more,
by how much they be unlike thee; but with the superior creatures, by how
much they become more like to thee. and i enquired what [[iniquity]] was,
and found it to be no substance, but the perversion of the will, turned
aside from thee, o [[god]], the supreme, towards these lower things, and
casting out its bowels, and puffed up outwardly.

and i wondered that i now loved thee, and no phantasm for thee. and
yet did i not press on to enjoy my [[god]]; but was borne up to thee by thy
beauty, and soon borne down from thee by mine own weight, sinking with
sorrow into these inferior things. this weight was carnal custom. yet
dwelt there with me a remembrance of thee; nor did i any way [[doubt]] that
there was one to whom i might cleave, but that i was not yet such as to
cleave to thee: for that the [[body]] which is corrupted presseth down the
soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the [[mind]] that museth upon
many things. and most [[certain]] i was, that thy invisible works [[work]] from the
creation of the [[world]] are clearly seen, being understood by the things
that are made, even thy eternal [[power]] and godhead. for examining whence
it was that i admired the [[beauty]] of bodies [[body]] celestial or terrestrial;
and what aided me in judging soundly on things mutable, and pronouncing,
"this ought to be thus, this not"; examining, i say, whence it was that
i so judged, seeing i did so [[judge]], i had found the unchangeable and
true eternity of [[truth]] above my changeable [[mind]]. and thus by degrees
i passed from bodies [[body]] to the [[soul]], which through the bodily senses
perceives; and thence to its inward faculty, to which the bodily senses
represent things external, whitherto reach the faculties of beasts; and
thence again to the reasoning faculty, to which what is received from
the senses of the [[body]], is referred to be judged. which finding
itself also to be in me a thing variable, raised itself up to its
own understanding, and drew away my thoughts [[thought]] from the [[power]] of habit,
withdrawing itself from those [[troops]] of contradictory phantasms; that so
it might find what that [[light]] was whereby it was bedewed, when, without
all doubting, it cried out, "that the unchangeable was to be preferred
to the changeable"; whence also it knew that unchangeable, which, unless
it had in some way known, it had had no sure ground to prefer it to the
changeable. and thus with the flash of one trembling glance it arrived
at that which is. and then i saw thy invisible things understood by
the things which are made. but i could not fix my gaze thereon; and my
infirmity being struck back, i was thrown again on my wonted habits,
carrying along with me only a loving memory thereof, and a longing for
what i had, as it were, perceived the odour of, but was not yet able to
feed on.

then i sought a way of obtaining [[strength]] sufficient to enjoy thee; and
found it not, until i embraced that mediator betwixt [[god]] and [[men]], the
man [[christ]] [[jesus]], who is over all, [[god]] blessed for evermore, calling
unto me, and saying, i am the way, the [[truth]], and the [[life]], and mingling
that food which i was unable to receive, with our flesh. for, the word
was made flesh, that thy [[wisdom]], whereby thou createdst all things,
might provide milk for our infant [[state]]. for i did not hold to my lord
jesus [[christ]], i, humbled, to the humble; nor knew i yet whereto his
infirmity would guide us. for thy word, the eternal [[truth]], far above the
higher parts of thy creation, raises up the subdued unto itself: but
in this lower [[world]] built for itself a lowly habitation of our clay,
whereby to abase from themselves such as would be subdued, and bring
them over to himself; allaying their swelling, and fomenting their [[love]];
to the end they might go on no further in self-confidence, but rather
consent to become [[weak]], seeing before their feet the divinity [[weak]] by
taking our coats of skin; and wearied, might cast themselves down upon
it, and it rising, might lift them up.

but i [[thought]] otherwise; conceiving only of my [[lord]] [[christ]] as of a man
of excellent [[wisdom]], whom no one could be equalled unto; especially,
for that being wonderfully born of a virgin, he seemed, in conformity
therewith, through the [[divine]] [[care]] for us, to have attained that great
eminence of [[authority]], for an ensample of despising things temporal for
the obtaining of immortality. but what mystery there lay in "the word
was made flesh," i could not even imagine. only i had learnt out of what
is delivered to us in writing of him that he did [[eat]], and drink, sleep,
walk, rejoiced in spirit, was sorrowful, discoursed; that flesh did not
cleave by itself unto thy word, but with the [[human]] [[soul]] and [[mind]]. all
know this who [[know]] the unchangeableness of thy word, which i now knew,
as far as i could, nor did i at all [[doubt]] thereof. for, now to move the
limbs of the [[body]] by will, now not, now to be moved by some affection,
now not, now to deliver [[wise]] sayings through [[human]] signs, now to keep
silence, belong to [[soul]] and [[mind]] [[subject]] to variation. and should these
things be falsely written of him, all the rest also would risk the
charge, nor would there remain in those books [[book]] any saving [[faith]] for
mankind. since then they were written truly, i acknowledged a perfect
man to be in [[christ]]; not the [[body]] of a [[man]] only, nor, with the [[body]], a
sensitive [[soul]] without a [[rational]], but very [[man]]; whom, not only as being
a form of [[truth]], but for a [[certain]] [[great]] excellence of [[human]] [[nature]] and
a more [[perfect]] participation of [[wisdom]], i judged to be preferred before
others. but alypius imagined the catholics to [[believe]] [[god]] to be so
clothed with flesh, that besides [[god]] and flesh, there was no [[soul]] at all
in [[christ]], and did not [[think]] that a [[human]] [[mind]] was ascribed to him. and
because he was well persuaded that the actions recorded of him could
only be performed by a vital and a [[rational]] creature, he moved the more
slowly towards the [[christian]] [[faith]]. but understanding afterwards that
this was the error of the apollinarian heretics, he joyed in and was
conformed to the catholic [[faith]]. but somewhat later, i confess, did i
learn how in that saying, the word was made flesh, the catholic truth
is distinguished from the falsehood of photinus. for the rejection of
heretics makes the tenets of thy [[church]] and sound doctrine to stand out
more clearly. for there must also be heresies, that the approved may be
made manifest among the [[weak]].

but having then [[read]] those books [[book]] of the platonists, and thence been
taught to search for incorporeal [[truth]], i saw thy invisible things,
understood by those things which are made; and though cast back, i
perceived what that was which through the darkness of my [[mind]] i was
hindered from contemplating, being assured "that thou wert, and wert
infinite, and yet not diffused in space, finite or infinite; and that
thou truly art [[arts]] who art [[arts]] the same ever, in no part nor motion varying;
and that all other things are from thee, on this most sure ground alone,
that they are." of these things i was assured, yet too unsure to enjoy
thee. i prated as one well skilled; but had i not sought thy way in
christ our saviour, i had proved to be, not skilled, but killed. for now
i had begun to [[wish]] to seem [[wise]], being filled with mine own [[punishment]],
yet i did not mourn, but rather scorn, puffed up with [[knowledge]]. for
where was that charity building upon the foundation of [[humility]], which
is [[christ]] [[jesus]]? or when should these books [[book]] [[teach]] me it? upon these, i
believe, thou therefore willedst that i should fall, before i studied
thy scriptures [[scripture]], that it might be imprinted on my memory how i was
affected by them; and that afterwards when my spirits were tamed through
thy books [[book]], and my wounds touched by thy healing fingers, i might discern
and distinguish between presumption and [[confession]]; between those who
saw whither they were to go, yet saw not the way, and the way that
leadeth not to behold only but to dwell in the beatific [[country]]. for
had i first been formed in thy holy scriptures [[scripture]], and hadst thou in the
familiar use of them grown sweet unto me, and had i then fallen upon
those other volumes, they might perhaps have withdrawn me from the solid
ground of piety, or, had i continued in that healthful frame which i had
thence imbibed, i might have [[thought]] that it might have been obtained by
the study of those books [[book]] alone.

most eagerly then did i seize that venerable writing of thy spirit; and
chiefly the apostle paul. whereupon those difficulties vanished away,
wherein he once seemed to me to contradict himself, and the text of his
discourse not to agree with the testimonies of the [[law]] and the prophets [[prophet]].
and the face of that pure word appeared to me one and the same; and i
learned to rejoice with trembling. so i began; and whatsoever truth
i had [[read]] in those other books [[book]], i found here amid the [[praise]] of thy
grace; that whoso sees, may not so [[glory]] as if he had not received, not
only what he sees, but also that he sees (for what hath he, which he
hath not received?), and that he may be not only admonished to behold
thee, who art [[arts]] ever the same, but also healed, to hold thee; and that he
who cannot see afar off, may yet walk on the way, whereby he may arrive,
and behold, and hold thee. for, though a [[man]] be delighted with the law
of [[god]] after the inner [[man]], what shall he do with that other [[law]] in his
members which warreth against the [[law]] of his [[mind]], and bringeth him
into captivity to the [[law]] of [[sin]] which is in his members? for, thou art
righteous, o [[lord]], but we have sinned and committed [[iniquity]], and have
done wickedly, and thy hand is grown heavy upon us, and we are justly
delivered over unto that ancient sinner, the [[king]] of [[death]]; because
he persuaded our will to be like his will whereby he abode not in thy
truth. what shall wretched [[man]] do? who shall deliver him from the body
of his [[death]], but only thy grace, through [[jesus]] [[christ]] our [[lord]], whom
thou hast begotten co-eternal, and formedst in the beginning of thy
ways, in whom the [[prince]] of this [[world]] found nothing worthy of [[death]],
yet killed he him; and the handwriting, which was contrary to us, was
blotted out? this those writings contain not. those pages [[present]] not
the image of this piety, the tears of [[confession]], thy [[sacrifice]], a
troubled spirit, a broken and a contrite [[heart]], the salvation of the
people, the bridal [[city]], the earnest of the holy ghost, the cup of our
redemption. no [[man]] sings there, shall not my [[soul]] be submitted unto [[god]]?
for of him cometh my salvation. for he is my [[god]] and my salvation, my
guardian, i shall no more be moved. no one there hears him call, come
unto me, all ye that [[labour]]. they scorn to learn of him, because he is
meek and lowly in [[heart]]; for these things hast thou hid from the wise
and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. for it is one thing,
from the mountain's shaggy top to see the [[land]] of [[peace]], and to find no
way thither; and in [[vain]] to essay through ways unpassable, opposed and
beset by fugitives and deserters, under their captain the lion and the
dragon: and another to keep on the way that leads thither, guarded by
the host of the heavenly general; where they spoil not who have deserted
the heavenly [[army]]; for they avoid it, as very torment. these things did
wonderfully sink into my bowels, when i [[read]] that least of thy [[apostles]],
and had meditated upon thy works [[work]], and trembled exceedingly.




book viii


o my [[god]], let me, with thanksgiving, [[remember]], and confess unto thee thy
mercies on me. let my bones be bedewed with thy [[love]], and let them say
unto thee, who is like unto thee, o [[lord]]? thou hast broken my bonds in
sunder, i will offer unto thee the [[sacrifice]] of thanksgiving. and how
thou hast broken them, i will declare; and all who [[worship]] thee, when
they hear this, shall say, "blessed be the [[lord]], in [[heaven]] and in [[earth]],
great and wonderful is his name." thy words had stuck fast in my [[heart]],
and i was hedged round about on all sides by thee. of thy eternal [[life]] i
was now [[certain]], though i saw it in a figure and as through a glass. yet
i had ceased to [[doubt]] that there was an incorruptible substance, whence
was all other substance; nor did i now [[desire]] to be more [[certain]] of
thee, but more steadfast in thee. but for my temporal [[life]], all was
wavering, and my [[heart]] had to be purged from the old leaven. the way,
the saviour himself, well pleased me, but as yet i shrunk from going
through its straitness. and thou didst put into my [[mind]], and it seemed
good in my [[eyes]], to go to simplicianus, who seemed to me a [[good]] servant
of thine; and thy grace shone in him. i had heard also that from his
very [[youth]] he had lived most devoted unto thee. now he was grown into
years; and by [[reason]] of so [[great]] [[age]] spent in such zealous following of
thy ways, he seemed to me likely to have learned much [[experience]]; and
so he had. out of which store i wished that he would tell me (setting
before him my anxieties) which were the fittest way for one in my case
to walk in thy paths.

for, i saw the [[church]] full; and one went this way, and another that way.
but i was displeased that i [[led]] a secular [[life]]; yea now that my desires
no longer inflamed me, as of old, with hopes [[hope]] of [[honour]] and [[profit]],
a very grievous burden it was to undergo so heavy a bondage. for, in
comparison of thy sweetness, and the [[beauty]] of thy house which i loved,
those things delighted me no longer. but still i was enthralled with
the [[love]] of woman; nor did the apostle forbid me to [[marry]], although he
advised me to something [[better]], chiefly wishing that all [[men]] were as
himself was. but i being [[weak]], chose the more indulgent place; and
because of this alone, was tossed up and down in all beside, faint and
wasted with withering cares [[care]], because in other matters i was constrained
against my will to conform myself to a [[married]] [[life]], to which i was
given up and enthralled. i had heard from the mouth of the [[truth]],
that there were some eunuchs which had made themselves eunuchs for the
kingdom of heaven's sake: but, saith he, let him who can receive it,
receive it. surely [[vain]] are all [[men]] who are ignorant of [[god]], and could
not out of the [[good]] things which are seen, find out him who is [[good]]. but
i was no longer in that vanity; i had surmounted it; and by the common
witness of all thy creatures had found thee our creator, and thy word,
god with thee, and together with thee one [[god]], by whom thou createdst
all things. there is yet another [[kind]] of ungodly, who knowing [[god]],
glorified him not as [[god]], neither were thankful. into this also had
i fallen, but thy [[right]] hand upheld me, and took me thence, and thou
placedst me where i might recover. for thou hast said unto [[man]], behold,
the [[fear]] of the [[lord]] is [[wisdom]], and, [[desire]] not to seem [[wise]]; because
they who affirmed themselves to be [[wise]], became fools [[fool]]. but i had now
found the goodly pearl, which, selling all that i had, i ought to have
bought, and i hesitated.

to simplicianus then i went, the [[father]] of ambrose (a bishop now) in
receiving thy grace, and whom ambrose truly loved as a [[father]]. to him i
related the mazes of my wanderings. but when i mentioned that i had read
certain books [[book]] of the platonists, which victorinus, sometime rhetoric
professor of [[rome]] (who had died a [[christian]], as i had heard), had
translated into latin, he testified his joy that i had not fallen upon
the writings of other [[philosophers]], full of fallacies and deceits, after
the rudiments of this [[world]], whereas the platonists many ways [[led]] to the
belief in [[god]] and his word. then to exhort me to the [[humility]] of
christ, hidden from the [[wise]], and revealed to little ones, he spoke of
victorinus himself, whom while at [[rome]] he had most intimately known: and
of him he related what i will not conceal. for it contains [[great]] praise
of thy grace, to be confessed unto thee, how that aged [[man]], most learned
and skilled in the liberal sciences [[science]], and who had [[read]], and weighed
so many works [[work]] of the [[philosophers]]; the instructor of so many noble
senators, who also, as a monument of his excellent discharge of his
office, had (which [[men]] of this [[world]] esteem a high honour) both deserved
and obtained a statue in the roman forum; he, to that [[age]] a worshipper
of idols, and a partaker of the sacrilegious rites, to which almost all
the nobility of [[rome]] were given up, and had inspired the [[people]] with the
love of

         anubis, barking deity, and all
         the monster gods of every [[kind]], who fought
         'gainst [[neptune]], [[venus]], and minerva:

whom [[rome]] once conquered, now adored, all which the aged victorinus had
with thundering eloquence so many years defended;--he now blushed not
to be the child of thy [[christ]], and the new-born babe of thy fountain;
submitting his neck to the yoke of [[humility]], and subduing his forehead
to the reproach of the cross.

o [[lord]], [[lord]], which hast bowed the heavens [[heaven]] and come down, touched the
mountains and they did smoke, by what means didst thou convey thyself
into that breast? he used to [[read]] (as simplicianus said) the holy
scripture, most studiously sought and searched into all the christian
writings, and said to simplicianus (not openly, but privately and as
a friend), "understand that i am already a [[christian]]." whereto he
answered, "i will not [[believe]] it, nor will i rank you among christians [[christian]],
unless i see you in the [[church]] of [[christ]]." the other, in banter,
replied, "do walls then make christians [[christian]]?" and this he often said, that
he was already a [[christian]]; and simplicianus as often made the same
answer, and the conceit of the "walls" was by the other as often
renewed. for he feared to offend his [[friends]], proud daemon-worshippers,
from the height of whose babylonian [[dignity]], as from cedars of libanus,
which the [[lord]] had not yet broken down, he supposed the weight of enmity
would fall upon him. but after that by reading and earnest [[thought]] he
had gathered firmness, and feared to be denied by [[christ]] before the holy
angels, should he now be afraid to confess him before [[men]], and appeared
to himself guilty of a heavy offence, in being ashamed of the sacraments
of the [[humility]] of thy word, and not being ashamed of the sacrilegious
rites of those proud daemons, whose [[pride]] he had imitated and their
rites adopted, he became bold-faced against vanity, and shame-faced
towards the [[truth]], and suddenly and unexpectedly said to simplicianus
(as himself told me), "go we to the [[church]]; i [[wish]] to be made a
christian." but he, not containing himself for joy, went with him. and
having been admitted to the first sacrament and become a catechumen, not
long after he further gave in his name, that he might be regenerated by
baptism, [[rome]] wondering, the [[church]] rejoicing. the proud saw, and were
wroth; they gnashed with their teeth, and melted away. but the lord
god was the [[hope]] of thy servant, and he regarded not vanities and lying
madness.

to conclude, when the hour was come for making profession of his faith
(which at [[rome]] they, who are about to approach to thy grace, deliver,
from an elevated place, in the sight of all the faithful, in a set
form of words committed to memory), the presbyters, he said, offered
victorinus (as was done to such as seemed likely through bashfulness to
be alarmed) to make his profession more privately: but he chose rather
to profess his salvation in the presence of the holy multitude. "for
it was not salvation that he taught in rhetoric, and yet that he had
publicly professed: how much less then ought he, when pronouncing thy
word, to dread thy meek flock, who, when delivering his own words,
had not feared a mad multitude!" when, then, he went up to make his
profession, all, as they knew him, whispered his name one to another
with the voice of congratulation. and who there knew him not? and there
ran a low murmur through all the mouths of the rejoicing multitude,
victorinus! victorinus! sudden was the burst of rapture, that they saw
him; suddenly were they hushed that they might hear him. he pronounced
the true [[faith]] with an excellent boldness, and all wished to draw him
into their very [[heart]]; yea by their [[love]] and joy they drew him thither,
such were the hands wherewith they drew him.

good god! what takes place in [[man]], that he should more rejoice at the
salvation of a [[soul]] despaired of, and freed from greater peril, than if
there had always been [[hope]] of him, or the danger had been less? for so
thou also, merciful [[father]], dost more rejoice over one penitent than
over ninety-nine just persons [[person]] that need no repentance. and with much
joyfulness do we hear, so often as we hear with what joy the sheep which
had strayed is brought back upon the shepherd's shoulder, and the groat
is restored to thy treasury, the neighbours rejoicing with the woman
who found it; and the joy of the solemn service of thy house forceth
to tears, when in thy house it is [[read]] of thy younger [[son]], that he was
dead, and liveth again; had been lost, and is found. for thou rejoicest
in us, and in thy holy angels, holy through holy charity. for thou art
ever the same; for all things which abide not the same nor for ever,
thou for ever knowest in the same way.

what then takes place in the [[soul]], when it is more delighted at finding
or recovering the things it loves [[love]], than if it had ever had them? yea,
and other things witness hereunto; and all things are full of witnesses,
crying out, "so is it." the conquering commander triumpheth; yet had he
not conquered unless he had fought; and the more peril there was in the
battle, so much the more joy is there in the triumph. the storm tosses
the sailors, threatens shipwreck; all wax pale at approaching [[death]];
sky and sea are calmed, and they are exceeding joyed, as having been
exceeding afraid. a friend is sick, and his pulse threatens danger; all
who long for his recovery are sick in [[mind]] with him. he is restored,
though as yet he walks not with his former [[strength]]; yet there is such
joy, as was not, when before he walked sound and [[strong]]. yea, the very
pleasures of [[human]] [[life]] [[men]] acquire by difficulties, not those only
which fall upon us unlooked for, and against our wills, but even by
self-chosen, and pleasure-seeking trouble. eating and drinking have no
pleasure, unless there precede the pinching of [[hunger]] and thirst. [[men]],
given to drink, [[eat]] [[certain]] salt meats, to procure a troublesome heat,
which the drink allaying, causes [[pleasure]]. it is also ordered that the
affianced bride should not at once be given, lest as a husband he should
hold cheap whom, as betrothed, he sighed not after.

this [[law]] holds in foul and accursed joy; this in permitted and lawful
joy; this in the very purest [[perfection]] of [[friendship]]; this, in him who
was [[dead]], and lived again; had been lost and was found. every where the
greater joy is ushered in by the greater [[pain]]. what means this, o lord
my [[god]], whereas thou art [[arts]] everlastingly joy to thyself, and some things
around thee evermore rejoice in thee? what means this, that this portion
of things thus ebbs and flows alternately displeased and reconciled?
is this their allotted measure? is this all thou hast assigned to them,
whereas from the highest heavens [[heaven]] to the lowest [[earth]], from the beginning
of the [[world]] to the end of ages [[age]], from the angel to the worm, from the
first motion to the [[last]], thou settest each in its place, and realisest
each in their season, every thing [[good]] after its [[kind]]? woe is me! how
high art [[arts]] thou in the highest, and how deep in the deepest! and thou
never departest, and we scarcely return to thee.

up, [[lord]], and do; stir us up, and recall us; kindle and draw us;
inflame, grow sweet unto us, let us now [[love]], let us run. do not many,
out of a deeper hell of blindness than victorinus, return to thee,
approach, and are enlightened, receiving that [[light]], which they who
receive, receive [[power]] from thee to become thy sons [[son]]? but if they be less
known to the nations, even they that [[know]] them, joy less for them. for
when many joy together, each also has more exuberant joy for that they
are kindled and inflamed one by the other. again, because those known to
many, influence the more towards salvation, and lead the way with many
to [[follow]]. and therefore do they also who preceded them much rejoice in
them, because they rejoice not in them alone. for far be it, that in thy
tabernacle the persons [[person]] of the [[rich]] should be accepted before the [[poor]],
or the [[noble]] before the ignoble; seeing rather thou hast chosen the weak
things of the [[world]] to confound the [[strong]]; and the base things of this
world, and the things despised hast thou chosen, and those things which
are not, that thou mightest bring to nought things that are. and yet
even that least of thy [[apostles]], by whose tongue thou soundedst forth
these words, when through his warfare, paulus the proconsul, his pride
conquered, was made to pass under the easy yoke of thy [[christ]], and
became a provincial of the [[great]] [[king]]; he also for his former name saul,
was pleased to be called paul, in testimony of so [[great]] a [[victory]]. for
the [[enemy]] is more overcome in one, of whom he hath more hold; by whom
he hath hold of more. but the proud he hath more hold of, through their
nobility; and by them, of more through their [[authority]]. by how much the
more welcome then the [[heart]] of victorinus was esteemed, which the devil
had held as an impregnable possession, the tongue of victorinus,
with which mighty and keen weapon he had slain many; so much the more
abundantly ought thy sons [[son]] to rejoice, for that our [[king]] hath bound the
strong [[man]], and they saw his vessels taken from him and cleansed, and
made meet for thy [[honour]]; and become serviceable for the [[lord]], unto
every [[good]] [[work]].

but when that [[man]] of thine, simplicianus, related to me this of
victorinus, i was on [[fire]] to imitate him; for for this very end had
he related it. but when he had subjoined also, how in the days of the
emperor julian a [[law]] was made, whereby christians [[christian]] were forbidden to
teach the liberal sciences [[science]] or oratory; and how he, obeying this [[law]],
chose rather to give over the wordy school than thy word, by which
thou makest eloquent the tongues of the dumb; he seemed to me not more
resolute than blessed, in having thus found opportunity to wait on thee
only. which thing i was sighing for, bound as i was, not with another's
irons, but by my own iron will. my will the [[enemy]] held, and thence had
made a chain for me, and bound me. for of a forward will, was a lust
made; and a [[lust]] served, became custom; and custom not resisted, became
necessity. by which links, as it were, joined together (whence i called
it a chain) a hard bondage held me enthralled. but that new will which
had begun to be in me, freely to serve thee, and to [[wish]] to enjoy thee,
o [[god]], the only assured pleasantness, was not yet able to overcome my
former wilfulness, strengthened by [[age]]. thus did my two wills, one new,
and the other old, one carnal, the other [[spiritual]], struggle within me;
and by their discord, undid my [[soul]].

thus, i understood, by my own [[experience]], what i had [[read]], how the flesh
lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. myself
verily either way; yet more myself, in that which i approved in myself,
than in that which in myself i disapproved. for in this [[last]], it was now
for the more part not myself, because in much i rather endured against
my will, than acted willingly. and yet it was through me that custom had
obtained this [[power]] of warring against me, because i had come willingly,
whither i willed not. and who has any [[right]] to speak against it, if just
punishment [[follow]] the sinner? nor had i now any longer my former plea,
that i therefore as yet hesitated to be above the [[world]] and serve thee,
for that the [[truth]] was not altogether ascertained to me; for now it too
was. but i still under service to the [[earth]], refused to [[fight]] under thy
banner, and feared as much to be freed of all incumbrances, as we should
fear to be encumbered with it. thus with the baggage of this present
world was i held down pleasantly, as in sleep: and the thoughts [[thought]] wherein
i meditated on thee were like the efforts of such as would awake, who
yet overcome with a heavy drowsiness, are again drenched therein. and as
no one would sleep for ever, and in all men's sober [[judgment]] waking is
better, yet a [[man]] for the most part, feeling a heavy lethargy in all his
limbs, defers to shake off sleep, and though half displeased, yet, even
after it is [[time]] to rise, with [[pleasure]] yields to it, so was i assured
that much [[better]] were it for me to give myself up to thy charity, than
to give myself over to mine own cupidity; but though the former course
satisfied me and gained the mastery, the latter pleased me and held me
mastered. nor had i any thing to [[answer]] thee calling to me, awake,
thou that sleepest, and arise from the [[dead]], and [[christ]] shall give thee
light. and when thou didst on all sides show me that what thou saidst
was true, i, convicted by the [[truth]], had nothing at all to [[answer]], but
only those dull and drowsy words, "anon, anon," "presently," "leave
me but a little." but "presently, presently," had no [[present]], and my
"little while" went on for a long while; in [[vain]] i delighted in thy
law according to the inner [[man]], when another [[law]] in my members rebelled
against the [[law]] of my [[mind]], and [[led]] me captive under the [[law]] of sin
which was in my members. for the [[law]] of [[sin]] is the [[violence]] of custom,
whereby the [[mind]] is drawn and holden, even against its will; but
deservedly, for that it willingly fell into it. who then should deliver
me thus wretched from the [[body]] of this [[death]], but thy grace only,
through [[jesus]] [[christ]] our [[lord]]?

and how thou didst deliver me out of the bonds of [[desire]], wherewith i
was bound most straitly to carnal concupiscence, and out of the drudgery
of worldly things, i will now declare, and confess unto thy name, o
lord, my helper and my redeemer. amid increasing [[anxiety]], i was doing
my wonted [[business]], and daily sighing unto thee. i attended thy [[church]],
whenever [[free]] from the [[business]] under the burden of which i groaned.
alypius was with me, now after the third sitting released from his law
business, and awaiting to whom to sell his counsel, as i sold the skill
of speaking, if indeed teaching can impart it. nebridius had now, in
consideration of our [[friendship]], consented to [[teach]] under verecundus, a
citizen and a grammarian of milan, and a very intimate friend of us all;
who urgently [[desired]], and by the [[right]] of [[friendship]] challenged from our
company, such faithful aid as he greatly needed. nebridius then was not
drawn to this by any [[desire]] of advantage (for he might have made much
more of his learning had he so willed), but as a most [[kind]] and gentle
friend, he would not be wanting to a [[good]] office, and slight our
request. but he acted herein very discreetly, shunning to become known
to personages [[great]] according to this [[world]], avoiding the distraction
of [[mind]] thence ensuing, and desiring to have it [[free]] and at leisure, as
many hours as might be, to seek, or [[read]], or hear something concerning
wisdom.

upon a day then, nebridius being absent (i recollect not why), lo, there
came to see me and alypius, one pontitianus, our countryman so far as
being an african, in high office in the emperor's court. what he would
with us, i [[know]] not, but we sat down to converse, and it happened that
upon a table for some game, before us, he observed a [[book]], took, opened
it, and contrary to his expectation, found it the apostle paul; for he
thought it some of those books [[book]] which i was wearing myself in teaching.
whereat smiling, and looking at me, he expressed his joy and wonder that
he had on a sudden found this [[book]], and this only before my [[eyes]]. for he
was a [[christian]], and baptised, and often bowed himself before thee our
god in the [[church]], in frequent and continued prayers. when then i had
told him that i bestowed very [[great]] pains [[pain]] upon those scriptures [[scripture]], a
conversation arose (suggested by his account) on antony the egyptian
monk: whose name was in high [[reputation]] among thy servants, though to
that hour unknown to us. which when he discovered, he dwelt the more
upon that [[subject]], informing and wondering at our ignorance of one so
eminent. but we stood amazed, hearing thy wonderful works [[work]] most fully
attested, in times [[time]] so recent, and almost in our own, wrought in the true
faith and [[church]] catholic. we all wondered; we, that they were so [[great]],
and he, that they had not reached us.

thence his discourse turned to the flocks in the monasteries, and their
holy ways, a sweet-smelling savour unto thee, and the fruitful deserts
of the wilderness, whereof we knew nothing. and there was a monastery
at milan, full of [[good]] brethren [[brother]], without the [[city]] walls, under the
fostering [[care]] of ambrose, and we knew it not. he went on with his
discourse, and we listened in intent [[silence]]. he told us then how one
afternoon at triers, when the [[emperor]] was taken up with the circensian
games, he and three others, his companions, went out to walk in gardens
near the [[city]] walls, and there as they happened to walk in pairs, one
went apart with him, and the other two wandered by themselves; and
these, in their wanderings, lighted upon a [[certain]] cottage, inhabited
by [[certain]] of thy servants, [[poor]] in spirit, of whom is the kingdom
of [[heaven]], and there they found a little [[book]] containing the [[life]] of
antony. this one of them began to [[read]], [[admire]], and kindle at it; and
as he [[read]], to meditate on taking up such a [[life]], and giving over his
secular service to serve thee. and these two were of those whom they
style agents for the [[public]] affairs. then suddenly, filled with a holy
love, and a sober shame, in anger with himself cast his [[eyes]] upon his
friend, saying, "tell me, i [[pray]] thee, what would we attain by all these
labours of ours? what aim we at? what serve we for? can our hopes [[hope]] in
court rise higher than to be the emperor's favourites? and in this, what
is there not brittle, and full of perils? and by how many perils arrive
we at a greater peril? and when arrive we thither? but a friend of [[god]],
if i [[wish]] it, i become now at once." so spake he. and in [[pain]] with the
travail of a new [[life]], he turned his [[eyes]] again upon the [[book]], and
read on, and was changed inwardly, where thou sawest, and his [[mind]] was
stripped of the [[world]], as soon appeared. for as he [[read]], and rolled up
and down the waves of his [[heart]], he stormed at himself a while, then
discerned, and determined on a [[better]] course; and now being thine, said
to his friend, "now have i broken loose from those our hopes [[hope]], and am
resolved to serve [[god]]; and this, from this hour, in this place, i begin
upon. if thou likest not to imitate me, oppose not." the other answered,
he would cleave to him, to partake so glorious a [[reward]], so glorious
a service. thus both being now thine, were building the tower at the
necessary cost, the forsaking all that they had, and following thee.
then pontitianus and the other with him, that had walked in other parts
of the garden, came in search of them to the same place; and finding
them, reminded them to return, for the day was now far spent. but they
relating their resolution and [[purpose]], and how that will was begun and
settled in them, begged them, if they would not join, not to molest
them. but the others, though nothing altered from their former selves,
did yet bewail themselves (as he affirmed), and piously congratulated
them, recommending themselves to their prayers; and so, with hearts
lingering on the [[earth]], went away to the palace. but the other two,
fixing their [[heart]] on [[heaven]], remained in the cottage. and both had
affianced brides, who when they heard hereof, also dedicated their
virginity unto [[god]].

such was the story of pontitianus; but thou, o [[lord]], while he was
speaking, didst turn me round towards myself, taking me from behind my
back where i had placed me, unwilling to observe myself; and setting
me before my face, that i might see how foul i was, how crooked and
defiled, bespotted and ulcerous. and i beheld and stood aghast; and
whither to flee from myself i found not. and if i sought to turn mine
eye from off myself, he went on with his relation, and thou again didst
set me over against myself, and thrustedst me before my [[eyes]], that i
might find out mine [[iniquity]], and hate it. i had known it, but made as
though i saw it not, winked at it, and forgot it.

but now, the more ardently i loved those whose healthful affections i
heard of, that they had resigned themselves wholly to thee to be cured,
the more did i abhor myself, when compared with them. for many of my
years (some twelve) had now run out with me since my nineteenth, when,
upon the reading of cicero's hortensius, i was stirred to an earnest
love of [[wisdom]]; and still i was deferring to reject mere earthly
felicity, and give myself to search out that, whereof not the finding
only, but the very search, was to be preferred to the treasures and
kingdoms of the [[world]], though already found, and to the pleasures [[pleasure]] of the
body, though spread around me at my will. but i wretched, most wretched,
in the very commencement of my early [[youth]], had begged chastity of thee,
and said, "give me chastity and continency, only not yet." for i feared
lest thou shouldest hear me soon, and soon cure me of the disease
of concupiscence, which i wished to have satisfied, rather than
extinguished. and i had wandered through crooked ways in a sacrilegious
superstition, not indeed assured thereof, but as preferring it to the
others which i did not seek religiously, but opposed maliciously.

and i had [[thought]] that i therefore deferred from day to day to reject
the hopes [[hope]] of this [[world]], and [[follow]] thee only, because there did not
appear aught [[certain]], whither to direct my course. and now was the day
come wherein i was to be laid bare to myself, and my [[conscience]] was
to upbraid me. "where art [[arts]] thou now, my tongue? thou saidst that for an
uncertain [[truth]] thou likedst not to cast off the baggage of vanity; now,
it is [[certain]], and yet that burden still oppresseth thee, while they who
neither have so worn themselves out with seeking it, nor for often years
and more have been thinking thereon, have had their shoulders lightened,
and received wings to fly away." thus was i gnawed within, and
exceedingly confounded with a horrible shame, while pontitianus was so
speaking. and he having brought to a close his tale and the business
he came for, went his way; and i into myself. what said i not against
myself? with what scourges of condemnation lashed i not my [[soul]], that it
might [[follow]] me, striving to go after thee! yet it drew back; refused,
but excused not itself. all arguments were spent and confuted; there
remained a mute shrinking; and she feared, as she would [[death]], to be
restrained from the flux of that custom, whereby she was wasting to
death.

then in this [[great]] contention of my inward dwelling, which i had
strongly raised against my [[soul]], in the chamber of my [[heart]], troubled in
mind and countenance, i turned upon alypius. "what ails us?" i exclaim:
"what is it? what heardest thou? the unlearned start up and take heaven
by [[force]], and we with our learning, and without [[heart]], lo, where we
wallow in flesh and blood! are we ashamed to [[follow]], because others
are gone before, and not ashamed not even to [[follow]]?" some such words i
uttered, and my fever of [[mind]] tore me away from him, while he, gazing on
me in astonishment, kept [[silence]]. for it was not my wonted tone; and my
forehead, cheeks, [[eyes]], colour, tone of voice, spake my [[mind]] more than
the words i uttered. a little garden there was to our lodging, which we
had the use of, as of the whole house; for the master of the house, our
host, was not living there. thither had the tumult of my breast hurried
me, where no [[man]] might hinder the hot contention wherein i had engaged
with myself, until it should end as thou knewest, i knew not. only i
was healthfully distracted and dying, to [[live]]; knowing what [[evil]] thing i
was, and not knowing what [[good]] thing i was shortly to become. i retired
then into the garden, and alypius, on my steps. for his presence did not
lessen my privacy; or how could he forsake me so disturbed? we sate down
as far removed as might be from the house. i was troubled in spirit,
most vehemently indignant that i entered not into thy will and covenant,
o my [[god]], which all my bones cried out unto me to enter, and praised it
to the skies [[sky]]. and therein we enter not by ships, or chariots, or feet,
no, move not so far as i had come from the house to that place where we
were sitting. for, not to go only, but to go in thither was nothing else
but to will to go, but to will resolutely and thoroughly; not to turn
and toss, this way and that, a maimed and half-divided will, struggling,
with one part sinking as another rose.

lastly, in the very fever of my irresoluteness, i made with my [[body]] many
such motions as [[men]] sometimes would, but cannot, if either they have not
the limbs, or these be bound with bands, weakened with infirmity, or
any other way hindered. thus, if i tore my hair, beat my forehead, if
locking my fingers i clasped my knee; i willed, i did it. but i might
have willed, and not done it; if the [[power]] of motion in my limbs had not
obeyed. so many things then i did, when "to will" was not in itself "to
be able"; and i did not what both i longed incomparably more to do, and
which soon after, when i should will, i should be able to do; because
soon after, when i should will, i should will thoroughly. for in these
things the ability was one with the will, and to will was to do; and yet
was it not done: and more easily did my [[body]] obey the weakest willing of
my [[soul]], in moving its limbs at its nod, than the [[soul]] obeyed itself to
accomplish in the will alone this its momentous will.

whence is this monstrousness? and to what end? let thy [[mercy]] gleam that
i may ask, if so be the secret penalties of [[men]], and those darkest
pangs of the sons [[son]] of adam, may perhaps [[answer]] me. whence is this
monstrousness? and to what end? the [[mind]] commands the [[body]], and it obeys
instantly; the [[mind]] commands itself, and is resisted. the [[mind]] commands
the hand to be moved; and such readiness is there, that command is
scarce distinct from [[obedience]]. yet the [[mind]] is [[mind]], the hand is [[body]].
the [[mind]] commands the [[mind]], its own [[self]], to will, and yet it doth not.
whence this monstrousness? and to what end? it commands itself, i say,
to will, and would not command, unless it willed, and what it commands
is not done. but it willeth not entirely: therefore doth it not command
entirely. for so far forth it commandeth, as it willeth: and, so far
forth is the thing commanded, not done, as it willeth not. for the will
commandeth that there be a will; not another, but itself. but it doth
not command entirely, therefore what it commandeth, is not. for were
the will entire, it would not even command it to be, because it would
already be. it is therefore no monstrousness partly to will, partly to
nill, but a disease of the [[mind]], that it doth not wholly rise, by truth
upborne, borne down by custom. and therefore are there two wills, for
that one of them is not entire: and what the one lacketh, the other
hath.

let them perish from thy presence, o [[god]], as perish [[vain]] talkers and
seducers of the [[soul]]: who observing that in deliberating there were two
wills, affirm that there are two minds [[mind]] in us of two kinds [[kind]], one [[good]], the
other [[evil]]. themselves are truly [[evil]], when they hold these [[evil]] things;
and themselves shall become [[good]] when they hold the [[truth]] and assent
unto the [[truth]], that thy apostle may say to them, ye were sometimes
darkness, but now [[light]] in the [[lord]]. but they, wishing to be [[light]], not
in the [[lord]], but in themselves, imagining the [[nature]] of the [[soul]] to
be that which [[god]] is, are made more gross darkness through a dreadful
arrogancy; for that they went back farther from thee, the true light
that enlightened every [[man]] that cometh into the [[world]]. take heed what
you say, and blush for shame: draw near unto him and be enlightened,
and your faces shall not be ashamed. myself when i was deliberating
upon serving the [[lord]] my [[god]] now, as i had long purposed, it was i who
willed, i who nilled, i, i myself. i neither willed entirely, nor nilled
entirely. therefore was i at strife with myself, and rent asunder by
myself. and this rent befell me against my will, and yet indicated, not
the presence of another [[mind]], but the [[punishment]] of my own. therefore it
was no more i that wrought it, but [[sin]] that dwelt in me; the punishment
of a [[sin]] more freely committed, in that i was a [[son]] of adam.

for if there be so many contrary natures [[nature]] as there be conflicting wills,
there shall now be not two only, but many. if a [[man]] deliberate whether
he should go to their conventicle or to the theatre, these manichees
cry out, behold, here are two natures [[nature]]: one [[good]], draws this way; another
bad, draws back that way. for whence else is this hesitation between
conflicting wills? but i say that both be [[bad]]: that which draws to them,
as that which draws back to the theatre. but they [[believe]] not that
will to be other than [[good]], which draws to them. what then if one of us
should deliberate, and amid the strife of his two wills be in a strait,
whether he should go to the theatre or to our [[church]]? would not these
manichees also be in a strait what to [[answer]]? for either they must
confess (which they fain would not) that the will which leads to our
church is [[good]], as well as theirs, who have received and are held by the
mysteries of theirs: or they must suppose two [[evil]] natures [[nature]], and two evil
souls conflicting in one [[man]], and it will not be true, which they say,
that there is one [[good]] and another [[bad]]; or they must be converted to the
truth, and no more deny that where one deliberates, one [[soul]] fluctuates
between contrary wills.

let them no more say then, when they perceive two conflicting wills
in one [[man]], that the conflict is between two contrary souls [[soul]], of two
contrary substances, from two contrary principles [[principle]], one [[good]], and the
other [[bad]]. for thou, o true [[god]], dost disprove, check, and convict them;
as when, both wills being [[bad]], one deliberates whether he should kill
a [[man]] by poison or by the [[sword]]; whether he should seize this or that
estate of another's, when he cannot both; whether he should purchase
pleasure by luxury, or keep his [[money]] by covetousness; whether he go to
the circus or the theatre, if both be open on one day; or thirdly, to
rob another's house, if he have the opportunity; or, fourthly, to commit
adultery, if at the same [[time]] he have the means thereof also; all these
meeting together in the same juncture of [[time]], and all being equally
desired, which cannot at one [[time]] be acted: for they rend the mind
amid four, or even (amid the vast variety of things desired) more,
conflicting wills, nor do they yet allege that there are so many divers
substances. so also in wills which are [[good]]. for i ask them, is it good
to take [[pleasure]] in reading the apostle? or [[good]] to take [[pleasure]] in
a sober psalm? or [[good]] to discourse on the gospel? they will [[answer]] to
each, "it is [[good]]." what then if all give [[equal]] [[pleasure]], and all at
once? do not divers wills distract the [[mind]], while he deliberates which
he should rather choose? yet are they all [[good]], and are at variance till
one be chosen, whither the one entire will may be borne, which before
was divided into many. thus also, when, above, eternity delights us, and
the [[pleasure]] of temporal [[good]] holds us down below, it is the same soul
which willeth not this or that with an entire will; and therefore is
rent asunder with grievous perplexities, while out of [[truth]] it sets this
first, but out of habit sets not that aside.

thus soul-sick was i, and tormented, accusing myself much more severely
than my wont, rolling and turning me in my chain, till that were wholly
broken, whereby i now was but just, but still was, held. and thou, o
lord, pressedst upon me in my inward parts by a severe [[mercy]], redoubling
the lashes of [[fear]] and shame, lest i should again give way, and not
bursting that same slight remaining tie, it should recover [[strength]], and
bind me the faster. for i said with myself, "be it done now, be it done
now." and as i spake, i all but enacted it: i all but did it, and did
it not: yet sunk not back to my former [[state]], but kept my stand hard by,
and took breath. and i essayed again, and wanted somewhat less of it,
and somewhat less, and all but touched, and laid hold of it; and yet
came not at it, nor touched nor laid hold of it; hesitating to [[die]] to
death and to [[live]] to [[life]]: and the worse whereto i was inured, prevailed
more with me than the [[better]] whereto i was unused: and the very moment
wherein i was to become other than i was, the nearer it approached me,
the greater [[horror]] did it strike into me; yet did it not strike me back,
nor turned me away, but held me in suspense.

the very toys of toys, and vanities of vanities, my ancient mistresses,
still held me; they plucked my fleshy garment, and whispered softly,
"dost thou cast us off? and from that moment shall we no more be with
thee for ever? and from that moment shall not this or that be lawful
for thee for ever?" and what was it which they suggested in that i said,
"this or that," what did they suggest, o my [[god]]? let thy [[mercy]] turn it
away from the [[soul]] of thy servant. what defilements did they suggest!
what shame! and now i much less than half heard them, and not openly
showing themselves and contradicting me, but muttering as it were behind
my back, and privily plucking me, as i was departing, but to look back
on them. yet they did retard me, so that i hesitated to burst and
shake myself [[free]] from them, and to spring over whither i was called;
a [[violent]] habit saying to me, "thinkest thou, thou canst [[live]] without
them?"

but now it spake very faintly. for on that side whither i had set my
face, and whither i trembled to go, there appeared unto me the chaste
dignity of continency, serene, yet not relaxedly, [[gay]], honestly alluring
me to come and [[doubt]] not; and stretching forth to receive and embrace
me, her holy hands full of multitudes of [[good]] examples [[example]]: there were so
many [[young]] [[men]] and maidens here, a multitude of [[youth]] and every [[age]],
grave widows and aged virgins; and continence herself in all, not
barren, but a fruitful [[mother]] of [[children]] of joys, by thee her husband,
o [[lord]]. and she smiled on me with a persuasive mockery, as would she
say, "canst not thou what these youths [[youth]], what these maidens can? or can
they either in themselves, and not rather in the [[lord]] their [[god]]? the
lord their [[god]] gave me unto them. why standest thou in thyself, and
so standest not? cast thyself upon him, [[fear]] not he will not withdraw
himself that thou shouldest fall; cast thyself fearlessly upon him, he
will receive, and will heal thee." and i blushed exceedingly, for that
i yet heard the muttering of those toys, and hung in suspense. and she
again seemed to say, "stop thine ears against those thy unclean members
on the [[earth]], that they may be mortified. they tell thee of delights,
but not as doth the [[law]] of the [[lord]] thy [[god]]." this controversy in my
heart was [[self]] against [[self]] only. but alypius sitting close by my side,
in [[silence]] waited the issue of my unwonted emotion.

but when a deep consideration had from the secret bottom of my soul
drawn together and heaped up all my misery in the sight of my [[heart]];
there arose a mighty storm, bringing a mighty shower of tears. which
that i might pour forth wholly, in its [[natural]] expressions, i rose from
alypius: solitude was suggested to me as fitter for the [[business]] of
weeping; so i retired so far that even his presence could not be a
burden to me. thus was it then with me, and he perceived something of
it; for something i suppose i had spoken, wherein the tones of my voice
appeared choked with weeping, and so had risen up. he then remained
where we were sitting, most extremely astonished. i cast myself down i
know not how, under a [[certain]] fig-tree, giving full vent to my tears;
and the floods of mine [[eyes]] gushed out an acceptable [[sacrifice]] to thee.
and, not indeed in these words, yet to this [[purpose]], spake i much unto
thee: and thou, o [[lord]], how long? how long, [[lord]], wilt thou be angry for
ever? [[remember]] not our former iniquities, for i [[felt]] that i was held by
them. i sent up these sorrowful words: how long, how long, "to-morrow,
and tomorrow?" why not now? why not is there this hour an end to my
uncleanness?

so was i speaking and weeping in the most bitter contrition of my [[heart]],
when, lo! i heard from a neighbouring house a voice, as of boy or girl,
i [[know]] not, chanting, and oft repeating, "take up and [[read]]; take up and
read." instantly, my countenance altered, i began to [[think]] most intently
whether [[children]] were wont in any [[kind]] of play to sing such words: nor
could i [[remember]] ever to have heard the like. so checking the torrent
of my tears, i arose; interpreting it to be no other than a command from
god to open the [[book]], and [[read]] the first [[chapter]] i should find. for i
had heard of antony, that coming in during the reading of the gospel,
he received the admonition, as if what was being [[read]] was spoken to him:
go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the [[poor]], and thou shalt have
treasure in [[heaven]], and come and [[follow]] me: and by such oracle he was
forthwith converted unto thee. eagerly then i returned to the place
where alypius was sitting; for there had i laid the volume of the
apostle when i arose thence. i seized, opened, and in [[silence]] [[read]] that
section on which my [[eyes]] first fell: not in rioting and drunkenness, not
in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye
on the [[lord]] [[jesus]] [[christ]], and make not provision for the flesh, in
concupiscence. no further would i [[read]]; nor needed i: for instantly at
the end of this sentence, by a [[light]] as it were of serenity infused into
my [[heart]], all the darkness of [[doubt]] vanished away.

then putting my finger between, or some other mark, i shut the volume,
and with a calmed countenance made it known to alypius. and what was
wrought in him, which i knew not, he thus showed me. he [[asked]] to see
what i had [[read]]: i showed him; and he looked even further than i had
read, and i knew not what followed. this followed, him that is [[weak]] in
the [[faith]], receive; which he applied to himself, and disclosed to me.
and by this admonition was he strengthened; and by a [[good]] resolution and
purpose, and most corresponding to his [[character]], wherein he did always
very far differ from me, for the [[better]], without any turbulent delay he
joined me. thence we go in to my [[mother]]; we tell her; she rejoiceth: we
relate in order how it took place; she leaps for joy, and triumpheth,
and blesseth thee, who are able to do above that which we ask or [[think]];
for she perceived that thou hadst given her more for me, than she
was wont to beg by her pitiful and most sorrowful groanings. for thou
convertedst me unto thyself, so that i sought neither [[wife]], nor any hope
of this [[world]], standing in that [[rule]] of [[faith]], where thou hadst showed
me unto her in a vision, so many years before. and thou didst convert
her mourning into joy, much more plentiful than she had [[desired]], and
in a much more precious and purer way than she erst required, by having
grandchildren of my [[body]].




book ix


o [[lord]], i am thy servant; i am thy servant, and the [[son]] of thy handmaid:
thou hast broken my bonds in sunder. i will offer to thee the sacrifice
of [[praise]]. let my [[heart]] and my tongue [[praise]] thee; yea, let all my bones
say, o [[lord]], who is like unto thee? let them say, and [[answer]] thou me,
and say unto my [[soul]], i am thy salvation. who am i, and what am i? what
evil have not been either my deeds, or if not my deeds, my words, or if
not my words, my will? but thou, o [[lord]], are [[good]] and merciful, and thy
right hand had [[respect]] unto the depth of my [[death]], and from the bottom
of my [[heart]] emptied that abyss of [[corruption]]. and this thy whole gift
was, to nill what i willed, and to will what thou willedst. but where
through all those years, and out of what low and deep recess was my
free-will called forth in a moment, whereby to submit my neck to thy
easy yoke, and my shoulders unto thy [[light]] burden, o [[christ]] [[jesus]], my
helper and my redeemer? how sweet did it at once become to me, to want
the sweetnesses of those toys! and what i feared to be parted from, was
now a joy to part with. for thou didst cast them forth from me, thou
true and highest sweetness. thou castest them forth, and for them
enteredst in thyself, sweeter than all [[pleasure]], though not to flesh and
blood; brighter than all [[light]], but more hidden than all depths, higher
than all [[honour]], but not to the high in their own conceits. now was my
soul [[free]] from the biting cares [[care]] of canvassing and getting, and weltering
in filth, and scratching off the itch of [[lust]]. and my infant tongue
spake freely to thee, my brightness, and my riches [[rich]], and my health, the
lord my [[god]].

and i resolved in thy sight, not tumultuously to tear, but gently to
withdraw, the service of my tongue from the marts of lip-labour: that
the [[young]], no students in thy [[law]], nor in thy [[peace]], but in lying
dotages and law-skirmishes, should no longer buy at my mouth arms for
their madness. and very seasonably, it now wanted but very few days unto
the vacation of the vintage, and i resolved to endure them, then in a
regular way to take my leave, and having been purchased by thee, no
more to return for sale. our [[purpose]] then was known to thee; but to [[men]],
other than our own [[friends]], was it not known. for we had agreed among
ourselves not to let it out abroad to any: although to us, now ascending
from the valley of tears, and singing that [[song]] of degrees [[degree]], thou hadst
given sharp arrows, and destroying coals against the subtle tongue,
which as though advising for us, would thwart, and would out of love
devour us, as it doth its meat.

thou hadst pierced our hearts [[heart]] with thy charity, and we carried thy words
as it were fixed in our entrails: and the examples [[example]] of thy servants,
whom for black thou hadst made bright, and for [[dead]], alive, being piled
together in the receptacle of our thoughts [[thought]], kindled and burned up that
our heavy torpor, that we should not sink down to the abyss; and they
fired us so vehemently, that all the blasts of subtle tongues from
gainsayers might only inflame us the more fiercely, not extinguish
us. nevertheless, because for thy name's sake which thou hast hallowed
throughout the [[earth]], this our vow and [[purpose]] might also find some to
commend it, it seemed like ostentation not to wait for the vacation now
so near, but to quit beforehand a [[public]] profession, which was before
the [[eyes]] of all; so that all looking on this act of mine, and observing
how near was the [[time]] of vintage which i wished to anticipate, would
talk much of me, as if i had [[desired]] to appear some [[great]] one. and what
end had it served me, that [[people]] should repute and dispute upon my
purpose, and that our [[good]] should be [[evil]] spoken of.

moreover, it had at first troubled me that in this very summer my lungs
began to give way, amid too [[great]] literary [[labour]], and to breathe deeply
with difficulty, and by the [[pain]] in my chest to show that they were
injured, and to refuse any full or lengthened speaking; this had
troubled me, for it almost constrained me of necessity to lay down that
burden of teaching, or, if i could be cured and recover, at least to
intermit it. but when the full [[wish]] for leisure, that i might see
how that thou art [[arts]] the [[lord]], arose, and was fixed, in me; my [[god]], thou
knowest, i began even to rejoice that i had this secondary, and that
no feigned, excuse, which might something moderate the offence taken by
those who, for their sons' sake, wished me never to have the [[freedom]] of
thy sons [[son]]. full then of such joy, i endured till that interval of time
were run; it may have been some twenty days, yet they were endured
manfully; endured, for the covetousness which aforetime bore a part of
this heavy [[business]], had left me, and i remained alone, and had been
overwhelmed, had not patience taken its place. perchance, some of thy
servants, my brethren [[brother]], may say that i sinned in this, that with a heart
fully set on thy service, i [[suffered]] myself to sit even one hour in the
chair of lies [[lie]]. nor would i be contentious. but hast not thou, o most
merciful [[lord]], pardoned and remitted this [[sin]] also, with my other most
horrible and deadly sins [[sin]], in the holy water?

verecundus was worn down with [[care]] about this our blessedness, for that
being held back by bonds, whereby he was most straitly bound, he saw
that he should be severed from us. for himself was not yet a [[christian]],
his [[wife]] one of the faithful; and yet hereby, more rigidly than by any
other chain, was he let and hindered from the [[journey]] which we had now
essayed. for he would not, he said, be a [[christian]] on any other terms
than on those he could not. however, he offered us courteously to remain
at his country-house so long as we should stay there. thou, o [[lord]],
shalt [[reward]] him in the resurrection of the just, seeing thou hast
already given him the lot of the righteous. for although, in our
absence, being now at [[rome]], he was seized with bodily sickness, and
therein being made a [[christian]], and one of the faithful, he departed
this [[life]]; yet hadst thou [[mercy]] not on him only, but on us also: lest
remembering the exceeding [[kindness]] of our friend towards us, yet unable
to number him among thy flock, we should be agonised with intolerable
sorrow. thanks unto thee, our [[god]], we are thine: thy suggestions
and consolations tell us, faithful in promises, thou now requitest
verecundus for his country-house of cassiacum, where from the fever
of the [[world]] we reposed in thee, with the eternal freshness of thy
paradise: for that thou hast forgiven him his sins [[sin]] upon [[earth]], in that
rich mountain, that mountain which yieldeth milk, thine own mountain.

he then had at that [[time]] [[sorrow]], but nebridius joy. for although he
also, not being yet a [[christian]], had fallen into the pit of that most
pernicious error, believing the flesh of thy [[son]] to be a phantom: yet
emerging thence, he believed as we did; not as yet endued with any
sacraments of thy [[church]], but a most ardent searcher out of [[truth]]. whom,
not long after our conversion and regeneration by thy baptism, being
also a faithful member of the [[church]] catholic, and serving thee in
perfect chastity and continence amongst his [[people]] in [[africa]], his whole
house having through him first been made [[christian]], didst thou release
from the flesh; and now he lives [[life]] in abraham's bosom. whatever that be,
which is signified by that bosom, there lives [[life]] my nebridius, my sweet
friend, and thy child, o [[lord]], adopted of a freed [[man]]: there he liveth.
for what other place is there for such a [[soul]]? there he liveth, whereof
he [[asked]] much of me, a [[poor]] inexperienced [[man]]. now lays he not his ear
to my mouth, but his [[spiritual]] mouth unto thy fountain, and drinketh as
much as he can receive, [[wisdom]] in proportion to his thirst, endlessly
happy. nor do i [[think]] that he is so inebriated therewith, as to forget
me; seeing thou, [[lord]], whom he drinketh, art [[arts]] mindful of us. so were
we then, comforting verecundus, who sorrowed, as far as friendship
permitted, that our conversion was of such sort; and exhorting him to
become faithful, according to his measure, namely, of a [[married]] estate;
and awaiting nebridius to [[follow]] us, which, being so near, he was all
but doing: and so, lo! those days rolled by at length; for long and many
they seemed, for the [[love]] i bare to the easeful [[liberty]], that i might
sing to thee, from my inmost marrow, my [[heart]] hath said unto thee, i
have sought thy face: thy face, [[lord]], will i seek.

now was the day come wherein i was in deed to be freed of my rhetoric
professorship, whereof in [[thought]] i was already freed. and it was done.
thou didst rescue my tongue, whence thou hadst before rescued my [[heart]].
and i blessed thee, rejoicing; retiring with all mine to the villa. what
i there did in writing, which was now enlisted in thy service, though
still, in this breathing-time as it were, panting from the school of
pride, my books [[book]] may witness, as well what i debated with others, as what
with myself alone, before thee: what with nebridius, who was absent, my
epistles bear witness. and when shall i have [[time]] to rehearse all thy
great benefits towards us at that [[time]], especially when hasting on to
yet greater mercies? for my remembrance recalls me, and pleasant is it
to me, o [[lord]], to confess to thee, by what inward goads thou tamedst me;
and how thou hast evened me, lowering the mountains and hills of my high
imaginations, straightening my crookedness, and smoothing my rough ways;
and how thou also subduedst the [[brother]] of my [[heart]], alypius, unto the
name of thy only begotten, our [[lord]] and saviour [[jesus]] [[christ]], which
he would not at first vouchsafe to have inserted in our writings. for
rather would he have them savour of the lofty cedars of the schools,
which the [[lord]] hath now broken down, than of the wholesome herbs of the
church, the antidote against serpents.

oh, in what accents spake i unto thee, my [[god]], when i [[read]] the psalms of
david, those faithful songs [[song]], and sounds of devotion, which allow of no
swelling spirit, as yet a catechumen, and a novice in thy real [[love]],
resting in that villa, with alypius a catechumen, my [[mother]] cleaving to
us, in female garb with masculine [[faith]], with the tranquillity of [[age]],
motherly [[love]], [[christian]] piety! oh, what accents did i utter unto thee
in those psalms, and how was i by them kindled towards thee, and on
fire to rehearse them, if possible, through the whole [[world]], against the
pride of mankind! and yet they are sung through the whole [[world]], nor can
any hide himself from thy heat. with what vehement and bitter [[sorrow]] was
i angered at the manichees! and again i pitied them, for they knew not
those sacraments, those medicines, and were mad against the antidote
which might have recovered them of their madness. how i would they
had then been somewhere near me, and without my knowing that they were
there, could have beheld my countenance, and heard my words, when i read
the fourth psalm in that [[time]] of my rest, and how that psalm wrought
upon me: when i called, the [[god]] of my [[righteousness]] heard me; in
tribulation thou enlargedst me. have [[mercy]] upon me, o [[lord]], and hear
my prayer. would that what i uttered on these words, they could hear,
without my knowing whether they heard, lest they should [[think]] i spake
it for their sakes! because in [[truth]] neither should i speak the same
things, nor in the same way, if i perceived that they heard and saw me;
nor if i spake them would they so receive them, as when i spake by and
for myself before thee, out of the [[natural]] feelings of my [[soul]].

i trembled for [[fear]], and again kindled with [[hope]], and with rejoicing in
thy [[mercy]], o [[father]]; and all issued forth both by mine [[eyes]] and voice,
when thy [[good]] spirit turning unto us, said, o ye sons [[son]] of [[men]], how long
slow of [[heart]]? why do ye [[love]] vanity, and seek after leasing? for i had
loved vanity, and sought after leasing. and thou, o [[lord]], hadst already
magnified thy holy one, raising him from the [[dead]], and setting him at
thy [[right]] hand, whence from on high he should send his promise, the
comforter, the spirit of [[truth]]. and he had already sent him, but i knew
it not; he had sent him, because he was now magnified, rising again from
the [[dead]], and ascending into [[heaven]]. for till then, the spirit was not
yet given, because [[jesus]] was not yet glorified. and the [[prophet]] cries
out, how long, slow of [[heart]]? why do ye [[love]] vanity, and seek after
leasing? [[know]] this, that the [[lord]] hath magnified his holy one. he cries
out, how long? he cries out, [[know]] this: and i so long, not knowing,
loved vanity, and sought after leasing: and therefore i heard and
trembled, because it was spoken unto such as i remembered myself to
have been. for in those phantoms which i had held for truths [[truth]], was
there vanity and leasing; and i spake aloud many things earnestly and
forcibly, in the bitterness of my remembrance. which would they had
heard, who yet [[love]] vanity and seek after leasing! they would perchance
have been troubled, and have vomited it up; and thou wouldest hear them
when they cried unto thee; for by a true [[death]] in the flesh did he die
for us, who now intercedeth unto thee for us.

i further [[read]], be angry, and [[sin]] not. and how was i moved, o my [[god]],
who had now learned to be angry at myself for things [[past]], that i might
not [[sin]] in [[time]] to come! yea, to be justly angry; for that it was not
another [[nature]] of a [[people]] of darkness which sinned for me, as they say
who are not angry at themselves, and treasure up wrath against the day
of wrath, and of the revelation of thy just [[judgment]]. nor were my good
things now without, nor sought with the [[eyes]] of flesh in that earthly
sun; for they that would have joy from without soon become [[vain]], and
waste themselves on the things seen and temporal, and in their famished
thoughts do lick their very shadows. oh that they were wearied out with
their famine, and said, who will show us [[good]] things? and we would say,
and they hear, the [[light]] of thy countenance is sealed upon us. for we
are not that [[light]] which enlighteneth every [[man]], but we are enlightened
by thee; that having been sometimes darkness, we may be [[light]] in thee.
oh that they could see the eternal internal, which having tasted, i was
grieved that i could not show it them, so long as they brought me their
heart in their [[eyes]] roving abroad from thee, while they said, who will
show us [[good]] things? for there, where i was angry within myself in my
chamber, where i was inwardly pricked, where i had sacrificed, slaying
my old [[man]] and commencing the [[purpose]] of a new [[life]], putting my trust
in thee,--there hadst thou begun to grow sweet unto me, and hadst put
gladness in my [[heart]]. and i cried out, as i [[read]] this outwardly, finding
it inwardly. nor would i be multiplied with worldly goods [[good]]; wasting away
time, and wasted by [[time]]; whereas i had in thy eternal simple essence
other corn, and wine, and [[oil]].

and with a loud cry of my [[heart]] i cried out in the next verse, o in
peace, o for the self-same! o what said he, i will lay me down and
sleep, for who shall hinder us, when cometh to pass that saying which is
written, [[death]] is swallowed up in [[victory]]? and thou surpassingly art [[arts]] the
self-same, who art [[arts]] not changed; and in thee is rest which forgetteth all
toil, for there is none other with thee, nor are we to seek those many
other things, which are not what thou art [[arts]]: but thou, [[lord]], alone hast
made me dwell in [[hope]]. i [[read]], and kindled; nor found i what to do to
those deaf and [[dead]], of whom myself had been, a pestilent [[person]], a
bitter and a blind bawler against those writings, which are honied
with the honey of [[heaven]], and lightsome with thine own [[light]]: and i was
consumed with zeal at the enemies [[enemy]] of this [[scripture]].

when shall i recall all which passed in those holy-days? yet neither
have i forgotten, nor will i pass over the severity of thy scourge, and
the wonderful swiftness of thy [[mercy]]. thou didst then torment me with
pain in my teeth; which when it had come to such height that i could not
speak, it came into my [[heart]] to [[desire]] all my [[friends]] [[present]] to pray
for me to thee, the [[god]] of all manner of health. and this i wrote on
wax, and gave it them to [[read]]. presently so soon as with humble devotion
we had bowed our knees, that [[pain]] went away. but what [[pain]]? or how went
it away? i was affrighted, o my [[lord]], my [[god]]; for from infancy i had
never experienced the like. and the [[power]] of thy nod was deeply conveyed
to me, and rejoicing in [[faith]], i praised thy name. and that faith
suffered me not to be at ease about my [[past]] sins [[sin]], which were not yet
forgiven me by thy baptism.

the vintage-vacation ended, i gave notice to the milanese to provide
their scholars with another master to sell words to them; for that i had
both made [[choice]] to serve thee, and through my difficulty of breathing
and [[pain]] in my chest was not [[equal]] to the professorship. and by letters
i signified to thy prelate, the holy [[man]] ambrose, my former errors and
present desires [[desire]], begging his [[advice]] what of thy scriptures [[scripture]] i had best
read, to become readier and fitter for receiving so [[great]] grace. he
recommended isaiah the [[prophet]]: i [[believe]], because he above the rest
is a more clear foreshower of the gospel and of the calling of the
gentiles. but i, not understanding the first lesson in him, and
imagining the whole to be like it, laid it by, to be resumed when better
practised in our lord's own words.

thence, when the [[time]] was come wherein i was to give in my name, we left
the [[country]] and returned to milan. it pleased alypius also to be with
me born again in thee, being already clothed with the [[humility]] befitting
thy sacraments; and a most valiant tamer of the [[body]], so as, with
unwonted venture, to wear the frozen ground of [[italy]] with his bare feet.
we joined with us the boy adeodatus, born after the flesh, of my [[sin]].
excellently hadst thou made him. he was not quite fifteen, and in wit
surpassed many grave and learned [[men]]. i confess unto thee thy gifts,
o [[lord]] my [[god]], creator of all, and abundantly able to reform our
deformities: for i had no part in that boy, but the [[sin]]. for that we
brought him up in thy discipline, it was thou, none else, had inspired
us with it. i confess unto thee thy gifts. there is a [[book]] of ours
entitled the master; it is a dialogue between him and me. thou knowest
that all there ascribed to the [[person]] conversing with me were his ideas [[idea]],
in his sixteenth year. much besides, and yet more admirable, i found
in him. that talent struck awe into me. and who but thou could be the
workmaster of such wonders? soon didst thou take his [[life]] from the
earth: and i now [[remember]] him without [[anxiety]], fearing nothing for
his [[childhood]] or [[youth]], or his whole [[self]]. him we joined with us, our
contemporary in grace, to be brought up in thy discipline: and we were
baptised, and [[anxiety]] for our [[past]] [[life]] vanished from us. nor was i
sated in those days with the wondrous sweetness of considering the depth
of thy counsels concerning the salvation of [[mankind]]. how did i weep,
in thy hymns and canticles, touched to the quick by the voices of thy
sweet-attuned church! the voices flowed into mine ears, and the
truth distilled into my [[heart]], whence the affections of my devotion
overflowed, and tears ran down, and [[happy]] was i therein.

not long had the [[church]] of milan begun to use this [[kind]] of consolation
and exhortation, the brethren [[brother]] zealously joining with harmony of voice
and hearts [[heart]]. for it was a year, or not much more, that justina, mother
to the [[emperor]] valentinian, a child, persecuted thy servant ambrose, in
favour of her heresy, to which she was seduced by the arians. the devout
people kept watch in the [[church]], ready to [[die]] with their bishop thy
servant. there my [[mother]] thy handmaid, bearing a [[chief]] part of those
anxieties and watchings, lived for prayer. we, yet unwarmed by the heat
of thy spirit, still were stirred up by the sight of the amazed and
disquieted [[city]]. then it was first instituted that after the manner of
the eastern churches [[church]], hymns and psalms should be sung, lest the people
should wax faint through the tediousness of [[sorrow]]: and from that day to
this the custom is retained, divers (yea, almost all) thy congregations,
throughout other parts of the [[world]] following herein.

then didst thou by a vision discover to thy forenamed bishop where the
bodies of gervasius and protasius the martyrs lay hid (whom thou hadst
in thy secret treasury stored uncorrupted so many years), whence thou
mightest seasonably [[produce]] them to repress the fury of a woman, but an
empress. for when they were discovered and dug up, and with due honour
translated to the ambrosian basilica, not only they who were vexed with
unclean spirits (the devils [[devil]] confessing themselves) were cured, but a
certain [[man]] who had for many years been blind, a citizen, and well known
to the [[city]], asking and hearing the [[reason]] of the people's confused joy,
sprang forth desiring his guide to lead him thither. [[led]] thither, he
begged to be allowed to touch with his handkerchief the bier of thy
saints, whose [[death]] is precious in thy sight. which when he had done,
and put to his [[eyes]], they were forthwith opened. thence did the fame
spread, thence thy praises [[praise]] glowed, shone; thence the [[mind]] of that [[enemy]],
though not turned to the soundness of believing, was yet turned back
from her fury of persecuting. thanks to thee, o my [[god]]. whence and
whither hast thou thus [[led]] my remembrance, that i should confess these
things also unto thee? which [[great]] though they be, i had passed by in
forgetfulness. and yet then, when the odour of thy ointments was so
fragrant, did we not run after thee. therefore did i more weep among
the singing of thy hymns, formerly sighing after thee, and at length
breathing in thee, as far as the breath may enter into this our house of
grass.

thou that makest [[men]] to dwell of one [[mind]] in one house, didst join with
us euodius also, a [[young]] [[man]] of our own [[city]]. who being an officer of
court, was before us converted to thee and baptised: and quitting his
secular warfare, girded himself to thine. we were together, about to
dwell together in our devout [[purpose]]. we sought where we might serve
thee most usefully, and were together returning to [[africa]]: whitherward
being as far as ostia, my [[mother]] departed this [[life]]. much i omit, as
hastening much. receive my confessions and thanksgivings, o my [[god]], for
innumerable things whereof i am silent. but i will not omit whatsoever
my [[soul]] would bring forth concerning that thy handmaid, who brought me
forth, both in the flesh, that i might be born to this temporal [[light]],
and in [[heart]], that i might be born to [[light]] eternal. not her gifts, but
thine in her, would i speak of; for neither did she make nor educate
herself. thou createdst her; nor did her [[father]] and [[mother]] [[know]] what a
one should come from them. and the sceptre of thy [[christ]], the discipline
of thine only [[son]], in a [[christian]] house, a [[good]] member of thy [[church]],
educated her in thy [[fear]]. yet for her [[good]] discipline was she wont
to commend not so much her mother's diligence, as that of a certain
decrepit maid-servant, who had carried her [[father]] when a child, as
little ones used to be carried at the backs of elder girls. for which
reason, and for her [[great]] [[age]], and excellent conversation, was she,
in that [[christian]] [[family]], well respected by its heads. whence also the
charge of her master's daughters [[daughter]] was entrusted to her, to which she gave
diligent heed, restraining them earnestly, when necessary, with a holy
severity, and teaching them with a grave discretion. for, except at
those hours wherein they were most temporately fed at their parents'
table, she would not suffer them, though parched with thirst, to drink
even water; preventing an [[evil]] custom, and adding this wholesome [[advice]]:
"ye drink water now, because you have not wine in your [[power]]; but when
you come to be [[married]], and be made mistresses of cellars and cupboards,
you will scorn water, but the custom of drinking will abide." by this
method of instruction, and the [[authority]] she had, she refrained the
greediness of [[childhood]], and moulded their very thirst to such an
excellent moderation that what they should not, that they would not.

and yet (as thy handmaid told me her son) there had crept upon her
a [[love]] of wine. for when (as the manner was) she, as though a sober
maiden, was bidden by her parents to draw wine out of the hogshed,
holding the vessel under the opening, before she poured the wine into
the flagon, she sipped a little with the tip of her lips; for more her
instinctive feelings refused. for this she did, not out of any desire
of drink, but out of the exuberance of [[youth]], whereby it boils over in
mirthful freaks, which in youthful spirits are wont to be kept under by
the gravity of their elders. and thus by adding to that little, daily
littles (for whoso despiseth little things shall fall by little and
little), she had fallen into such a habit as greedily to drink off her
little cup brim-full almost of wine. where was then that discreet old
woman, and that her earnest countermanding? would aught avail against
a secret disease, if thy healing hand, o [[lord]], watched not over us?
father, [[mother]], and governors absent, thou [[present]], who createdst, who
callest, who also by those set over us, workest something towards the
salvation of our souls [[soul]], what didst thou then, o my [[god]]? how didst thou
cure her? how heal her? didst thou not out of another [[soul]] bring forth a
hard and a sharp taunt, like a lancet out of thy secret store, and with
one touch remove all that foul stuff? for a maid-servant with whom she
used to go to the cellar, falling to words (as it happens) with her
little mistress, when alone with her, taunted her with this [[fault]], with
most bitter insult, calling her wine-bibber. with which taunt she, stung
to the quick, saw the foulness of her [[fault]], and instantly condemned and
forsook it. as flattering [[friends]] pervert, so reproachful enemies [[enemy]] mostly
correct. yet not what by them thou doest, but what themselves purposed,
dost thou repay them. for she in her anger sought to vex her young
mistress, not to amend her; and did it in private, either for that the
time and place of the quarrel so found them; or lest herself also should
have anger, for discovering it thus late. but thou, [[lord]], governor
of all in [[heaven]] and [[earth]], who turnest to thy purposes [[purpose]] the deepest
currents, and the ruled turbulence of the tide of times [[time]], didst by the
very unhealthiness of one [[soul]] heal another; lest any, when he observes
this, should ascribe it to his own [[power]], even when another, whom he
wished to be reformed, is reformed through words of his.

brought up thus modestly and soberly, and made [[subject]] rather by thee
to her parents, than by her parents to thee, so soon as she was of
marriageable [[age]], being bestowed upon a husband, she served him as her
lord; and did her diligence to [[win]] him unto thee, preaching thee unto
him by her conversation; by which thou ornamentedst her, making her
reverently amiable, and admirable unto her husband. and she so endured
the wronging of her bed as never to have any quarrel with her husband
thereon. for she looked for thy [[mercy]] upon him, that believing in thee,
he might be made chaste. but besides this, he was fervid, as in his
affections, so in anger: but she had learnt not to resist an angry
husband, not in deed only, but not even in word. only when he was
smoothed and tranquil, and in a temper to receive it, she would give an
account of her actions, if haply he had overhastily taken offence. in
a word, while many matrons, who had milder husbands, yet bore even in
their faces marks of shame, would in familiar talk blame their husbands'
lives, she would blame their tongues, giving them, as in jest, earnest
advice: "that from the [[time]] they heard the [[marriage]] writings [[read]] to
them, they should account them as indentures, whereby they were
made servants; and so, remembering their condition, ought not to set
themselves up against their lords [[lord]]." and when they, knowing what a
choleric husband she endured, marvelled that it had never been heard,
nor by any token perceived, that patricius had beaten his [[wife]], or that
there had been any domestic difference between them, even for one day,
and confidentially asking the [[reason]], she taught them her practice above
mentioned. those wives [[wife]] who observed it found the [[good]], and returned
thanks; those who observed it not, found no relief, and [[suffered]].

her mother-in-law also, at first by whisperings of [[evil]] servants
incensed against her, she so overcame by observance and persevering
endurance and meekness, that she of her own accord discovered to her
son the meddling tongues whereby the domestic [[peace]] betwixt her and her
daughter-in-law had been disturbed, asking him to [[correct]] them. then,
when in compliance with his [[mother]], and for the well-ordering of the
family, he had with stripes corrected those discovered, at her will who
had discovered them, she promised the like [[reward]] to any who, to please
her, should speak ill of her daughter-in-law to her: and none now
venturing, they lived together with a remarkable sweetness of mutual
kindness.

this [[great]] gift also thou bestowedst, o my [[god]], my [[mercy]], upon that good
handmaid of thine, in whose womb thou createdst me, that between any
disagreeing and discordant parties where she was able, she showed
herself such a peacemaker, that hearing on both sides most bitter
things, such as swelling and indigested choler uses to break out into,
when the crudities of enmities are breathed out in sour discourses to a
present friend against an absent [[enemy]], she never would disclose aught
of the one unto the other, but what might tend to their reconcilement.
a small [[good]] this might appear to me, did i not to my [[grief]] know
numberless persons [[person]], who through some horrible and wide-spreading
contagion of [[sin]], not only disclose to persons [[person]] mutually angered things
said in anger, but add withal things never spoken, whereas to humane
humanity, it ought to seem a [[light]] thing not to torment or increase ill
will by ill words, unless one study withal by [[good]] words to quench it.
such was she, thyself, her most inward instructor, teaching her in the
school of the [[heart]].

finally, her own husband, towards the very end of his earthly [[life]],
did she gain unto thee; nor had she to [[complain]] of that in him as a
believer, which before he was a believer she had borne from him. she was
also the servant of thy servants; whosoever of them knew her, did in her
much [[praise]] and [[honour]] and [[love]] thee; for that through the witness of
the fruits of a holy conversation they perceived thy presence in her
heart. for she had been the [[wife]] of one [[man]], had requited her parents,
had governed her house piously, was well reported of for [[good]] works [[work]], had
brought up [[children]], so often travailing in birth of them, as she saw
them swerving from thee. lastly, of all of us thy servants, o [[lord]] (whom
on [[occasion]] of thy own gift thou sufferest to speak), us, who before her
sleeping in thee lived [[united]] together, having received the grace of thy
baptism, did she so take [[care]] of, as though she had been [[mother]] of us
all; so served us, as though she had been child to us all.

the day now approaching whereon she was to depart this [[life]] (which day
thou well knewest, we knew not), it came to pass, thyself, as i [[believe]],
by thy secret ways so ordering it, that she and i stood alone, leaning
in a [[certain]] window, which looked into the garden of the house where we
now lay, at ostia; where removed from the din of [[men]], we were recruiting
from the fatigues of a long [[journey]], for the [[voyage]]. we were discoursing
then together, alone, very sweetly; and forgetting those things which
are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, we
were enquiring between ourselves in the presence of the [[truth]], which
thou art [[arts]], of what sort the eternal [[life]] of the saints was to be, which
eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the [[heart]] of
man. but yet we gasped with the mouth of our [[heart]], after those heavenly
streams of thy fountain, the fountain of [[life]], which is with thee; that
being bedewed thence according to our capacity, we might in some sort
meditate upon so high a mystery.

and when our discourse was brought to that point, that the very highest
delight of the earthly senses, in the very purest material [[light]],
was, in [[respect]] of the sweetness of that [[life]], not only not worthy of
comparison, but not even of mention; we raising up ourselves with a more
glowing affection towards the "self-same," did by degrees [[degree]] pass through
all things bodily, even the very [[heaven]] whence sun and moon and stars
shine upon the [[earth]]; yea, we were soaring higher yet, by inward musing,
and discourse, and admiring of thy works [[work]]; and we came to our own
minds, and went beyond them, that we might arrive at that region of
never-failing plenty, where thou feedest [[israel]] for ever with the food
of [[truth]], and where [[life]] is the [[wisdom]] by whom all these things are
made, and what have been, and what shall be, and she is not made, but
is, as she hath been, and so shall she be ever; yea rather, to "have
been," and "hereafter to be," are not in her, but only "to be," seeing
she is eternal. for to "have been," and to "be hereafter," are not
eternal. and while we were discoursing and panting after her, we
slightly touched on her with the whole effort of our [[heart]]; and we
sighed, and there we leave bound the first fruits of the spirit; and
returned to vocal expressions of our mouth, where the word spoken
has beginning and end. and what is like unto thy word, our [[lord]], who
endureth in himself without becoming old, and maketh all things new?

we were saying then: if to any the tumult of the flesh were hushed,
hushed the images of [[earth]], and waters, and air, hushed also the pole of
heaven, yea the very [[soul]] be hushed to herself, and by not thinking on
self surmount [[self]], hushed all dreams [[dream]] and imaginary revelations, every
tongue and every sign, and whatsoever exists only in transition, since
if any could hear, all these say, we made not ourselves, but he made us
that abideth for ever--if then having uttered this, they too should be
hushed, having roused only our ears to him who made them, and he alone
speak, not by them but by himself, that we may hear his word, not
through any tongue of flesh, nor angel's voice, nor sound of thunder,
nor in the dark riddle of a similitude, but might hear whom in these
things we [[love]], might hear his very [[self]] without these (as we two now
strained ourselves, and in swift [[thought]] touched on that eternal wisdom
which abideth over all);--could this be continued on, and other visions
of [[kind]] far unlike be withdrawn, and this one ravish, and absorb, and
wrap up its beholder amid these inward joys, so that [[life]] might be for
ever like that one moment of understanding which now we sighed after;
were not this, enter into thy master's joy? and when shall that be? when
we shall all rise again, though we shall not all be changed?

such things was i speaking, and even if not in this very manner, and
these same words, yet, [[lord]], thou knowest that in that day when we were
speaking of these things, and this [[world]] with all its delights became,
as we spake, contemptible to us, my [[mother]] said, "son, for mine own part
i have no further delight in any thing in this [[life]]. what i do here any
longer, and to what i am here, i [[know]] not, now that my hopes [[hope]] in this
world are accomplished. one thing there was for which i [[desired]] to
linger for a while in this [[life]], that i might see thee a catholic
christian before i died. my [[god]] hath done this for me more abundantly,
that i should now see thee withal, despising earthly [[happiness]], become
his servant: what do i here?"

what [[answer]] i made her unto these things, i [[remember]] not. for scarce
five days after, or not much more, she fell sick of a fever; and in that
sickness one day she fell into a swoon, and was for a while withdrawn
from these visible things. we hastened round her; but she was soon
brought back to her senses; and looking on me and my [[brother]] standing by
her, said to us enquiringly, "where was i?" and then looking fixedly on
us, with [[grief]] amazed: "here," saith she, "shall you bury your [[mother]]."
i held my [[peace]] and refrained weeping; but my [[brother]] spake something,
wishing for her, as the happier lot, that she might [[die]], not in a
strange place, but in her own [[land]]. whereat, she with anxious look,
checking him with her [[eyes]], for that he still savoured such things, and
then looking upon me: "behold," saith she, "what he saith": and soon
after to us both, "lay," she saith, "this [[body]] any where; let not the
care for that any way disquiet you: this only i request, that you would
remember me at the lord's altar, wherever you be." and having delivered
this sentiment in what words she could, she held her [[peace]], being
exercised by her growing sickness.

but i, considering thy gifts, thou unseen [[god]], which thou instillest
into the hearts [[heart]] of thy faithful ones, whence wondrous fruits do spring,
did rejoice and give thanks to thee, recalling what i before knew, how
careful and anxious she had ever been as to her place of burial, which
she had provided and prepared for herself by the [[body]] of her husband.
for because they had lived in [[great]] harmony together, she also wished
(so little can the [[human]] [[mind]] embrace things divine) to have this
addition to that [[happiness]], and to have it remembered among [[men]], that
after her pilgrimage beyond the seas, what was earthly of this united
pair had been permitted to be [[united]] beneath the same [[earth]]. but when
this emptiness had through the fulness of thy goodness begun to cease in
her [[heart]], i knew not, and rejoiced admiring what she had so disclosed
to me; though indeed in that our discourse also in the window, when she
said, "what do i here any longer?" there appeared no [[desire]] of dying
in her own [[country]]. i heard afterwards also, that when we were now
at ostia, she with a mother's confidence, when i was absent, one day
discoursed with [[certain]] of my [[friends]] about the contempt of this [[life]],
and the blessing of [[death]]: and when they were amazed at such courage
which thou hadst given to a woman, and [[asked]], "whether she were not
afraid to leave her [[body]] so far from her own [[city]]?" she replied,
"nothing is far to [[god]]; nor was it to be feared lest at the end of the
world, he should not recognise whence he were to raise me up." on the
ninth day then of her sickness, and the fifty-sixth year of her [[age]], and
the three-and-thirtieth of mine, was that [[religious]] and holy [[soul]] freed
from the [[body]].

i closed her [[eyes]]; and there flowed withal a mighty [[sorrow]] into my
heart, which was overflowing into tears; mine [[eyes]] at the same [[time]], by
the [[violent]] command of my [[mind]], drank up their fountain wholly dry; and
woe was me in such a strife! but when she breathed her [[last]], the boy
adeodatus burst out into a loud lament; then, checked by us all, held
his [[peace]]. in like manner also a childish feeling in me, which was,
through my heart's youthful voice, finding its vent in weeping, was
checked and silenced. for we [[thought]] it not fitting to solemnise that
funeral with tearful lament, and groanings; for thereby do they for
the most part express [[grief]] for the departed, as though unhappy, or
altogether [[dead]]; whereas she was neither unhappy in her [[death]], nor
altogether [[dead]]. of this we were assured on [[good]] grounds, the testimony
of her [[good]] conversation and her [[faith]] unfeigned.

what then was it which did grievously [[pain]] me within, but a fresh wound
wrought through the sudden wrench of that most sweet and dear custom of
living together? i joyed indeed in her testimony, when, in that her last
sickness, mingling her endearments with my acts of [[duty]], she called me
"dutiful," and mentioned, with [[great]] affection of [[love]], that she never
had heard any harsh or reproachful sound uttered by my mouth against
her. but yet, o my [[god]], who madest us, what comparison is there betwixt
that [[honour]] that i paid to her, and her [[slavery]] for me? being then
forsaken of so [[great]] comfort in her, my [[soul]] was wounded, and that life
rent asunder as it were, which, of hers and mine together, had been made
but one.

the boy then being stilled from weeping, euodius took up the psalter,
and began to sing, our whole house answering him, the psalm, i will sing
of [[mercy]] and judgments [[judgment]] to thee, o [[lord]]. but hearing what we were doing,
many brethren [[brother]] and [[religious]] [[women]] came together; and whilst they (whose
office it was) made ready for the burial, as the manner is, i, in a part
of the house, where i might properly, together with those who thought
not fit to leave me, discoursed upon something fitting the [[time]]; and by
this balm of [[truth]] assuaged that torment, known to thee, they unknowing
and listening intently, and conceiving me to be without all sense of
sorrow. but in thy ears, where none of them heard, i blamed the weakness
of my feelings, and refrained my flood of [[grief]], which gave way a little
unto me; but again came, as with a tide, yet not so as to burst out into
tears, nor to [[change]] of countenance; still i knew what i was keeping
down in my [[heart]]. and being very much displeased that these [[human]] things
had such [[power]] over me, which in the due order and appointment of our
natural condition must needs come to pass, with a new [[grief]] i grieved
for my [[grief]], and was thus worn by a double [[sorrow]].

and behold, the corpse was carried to the burial; we went and returned
without tears. for neither in those prayers which we poured forth unto
thee, when the [[sacrifice]] of our ransom was offered for her, when now the
corpse was by the grave's side, as the manner there is, previous to its
being laid therein, did i weep even during those prayers; yet was i the
whole day in secret heavily [[sad]], and with troubled [[mind]] prayed thee, as
i could, to heal my [[sorrow]], yet thou didst not; impressing, i [[believe]],
upon my memory by this one instance, how [[strong]] is the bond of all
habit, even upon a [[soul]], which now feeds upon no deceiving word. it
seemed also [[good]] to me to go and bathe, having heard that the bath had
its name (balneum) from the [[greek]] balaneion for that it drives sadness
from the [[mind]]. and this also i confess unto thy [[mercy]], [[father]] of the
fatherless, that i bathed, and was the same as before i bathed. for the
bitterness of [[sorrow]] could not exude out of my [[heart]]. then i slept, and
woke up again, and found my [[grief]] not a little softened; and as i was
alone in my bed, i remembered those true verses of thy ambrose. for thou
art the

         "maker of all, the [[lord]],
           and ruler of the height,
         who, robing day in [[light]], hast poured
           soft slumbers o'er the night,
         that to our limbs the power
           of toil may be renew'd,
         and hearts [[heart]] be rais'd that sink and cower,
           and sorrows [[sorrow]] be subdu'd."

and then by little and little i recovered my former thoughts [[thought]] of thy
handmaid, her holy conversation towards thee, her holy tenderness and
observance towards us, whereof i was suddenly deprived: and i was minded
to weep in thy sight, for her and for myself, in her behalf and in my
own. and i gave way to the tears which i before restrained, to overflow
as much as they [[desired]]; reposing my [[heart]] upon them; and it found rest
in them, for it was in thy ears, not in those of [[man]], who would have
scornfully interpreted my weeping. and now, [[lord]], in writing i confess
it unto thee. [[read]] it, who will, and interpret it, how he will: and if
he finds [[sin]] therein, that i wept my [[mother]] for a small portion of an
hour (the [[mother]] who for the [[time]] was [[dead]] to mine [[eyes]], who had for
many years wept for me that i might [[live]] in thine eyes), let him not
deride me; but rather, if he be one of large charity, let him weep
himself for my sins [[sin]] unto thee, the [[father]] of all the brethren [[brother]] of thy
christ.

but now, with a [[heart]] cured of that wound, wherein it might seem
blameworthy for an earthly feeling, i pour out unto thee, our [[god]], in
behalf of that thy handmaid, a far different [[kind]] of tears, flowing from
a spirit shaken by the thoughts [[thought]] of the dangers of every [[soul]] that dieth
in adam. and although she having been quickened in [[christ]], even before
her release from the flesh, had lived to the [[praise]] of thy name for
her [[faith]] and conversation; yet dare i not say that from what [[time]] thou
regeneratedst her by baptism, no word issued from her mouth against thy
commandment. thy [[son]], the [[truth]], hath said, whosoever shall say unto
his [[brother]], thou [[fool]], shall be in danger of hell [[fire]]. and woe be even
unto the commendable [[life]] of [[men]], if, laying aside [[mercy]], thou shouldest
examine it. but because thou art [[arts]] not extreme in enquiring after sins [[sin]], we
confidently [[hope]] to find some place with thee. but whosoever reckons up
his real merits [[merit]] to thee, what reckons he up to thee but thine own gifts?
o that [[men]] would [[know]] themselves to be [[men]]; and that he that glorieth
would [[glory]] in the [[lord]].

i therefore, o my [[praise]] and my [[life]], [[god]] of my [[heart]], laying aside for
a while her [[good]] deeds, for which i give thanks to thee with joy, do now
beseech thee for the sins [[sin]] of my [[mother]]. hearken unto me, i entreat thee,
by the medicine of our wounds, who hung upon the tree, and now sitting
at thy [[right]] hand maketh intercession to thee for us. i [[know]] that she
dealt mercifully, and from her [[heart]] forgave her debtors their debts; do
thou also [[forgive]] her debts, whatever she may have contracted in so
many years, since the water of salvation. [[forgive]] her, [[lord]], [[forgive]], i
beseech thee; enter not into [[judgment]] with her. let thy [[mercy]] be exalted
above thy [[justice]], since thy words are true, and thou hast promised
mercy unto the merciful; which thou gavest them to be, who wilt have
mercy on whom thou wilt have [[mercy]]; and wilt have compassion on whom
thou hast had compassion.

and, i [[believe]], thou hast already done what i ask; but accept, o [[lord]],
the free-will offerings of my mouth. for she, the day of her dissolution
now at hand, took no [[thought]] to have her [[body]] sumptuously wound up, or
embalmed with spices; nor [[desired]] she a [[choice]] monument, or to be buried
in her own [[land]]. these things she enjoined us not; but [[desired]] only to
have her name commemorated at thy altar, which she had served without
intermission of one day: whence she knew the holy [[sacrifice]] to be
dispensed, by which the hand-writing that was against us is blotted out;
through which the [[enemy]] was triumphed over, who summing up our offences,
and seeking what to lay to our charge, found nothing in him, in whom we
conquer. who shall restore to him the [[innocent]] [[blood]]? who repay him
the price wherewith he bought us, and so take us from him? unto the
sacrament of which our ransom, thy handmaid bound her [[soul]] by the bond
of [[faith]]. let none sever her from thy protection: let neither the lion
nor the dragon interpose himself by [[force]] or fraud. for she will not
answer that she owes nothing, lest she be convicted and seized by the
crafty accuser: but she will [[answer]] that her sins [[sin]] are forgiven her by
him, to whom none can repay that price which he, who owed nothing, paid
for us.

may she rest then in [[peace]] with the husband before and after whom she
had never any; whom she obeyed, with patience bringing forth fruit unto
thee, that she might [[win]] him also unto thee. and inspire, o [[lord]] my [[god]],
inspire thy servants my brethren [[brother]], thy sons [[son]] my masters, whom with
voice, and [[heart]], and pen i serve, that so many as shall [[read]] these
confessions, may at thy altar [[remember]] monnica thy handmaid, with
patricius, her sometimes husband, by whose bodies [[body]] thou broughtest me
into this [[life]], how i [[know]] not. may they with devout affection remember
my parents in this transitory [[light]], my brethren [[brother]] under thee our father
in our catholic [[mother]], and my fellow-citizens in that eternal jerusalem
which thy pilgrim [[people]] sigheth after from their exodus, even unto
their return thither. that so my mother's [[last]] request of me, may
through my confessions, more than through my prayers, be, through the
prayers of many, more abundantly fulfilled to her.




book x


let me [[know]] thee, o [[lord]], who knowest me: let me [[know]] thee, as i am
known. [[power]] of my [[soul]], enter into it, and fit it for thee, that
thou mayest have and hold it without spot or wrinkle. this is my [[hope]],
therefore do i speak; and in this [[hope]] do i rejoice, when i rejoice
healthfully. other things of this [[life]] are the less to be sorrowed for,
the more they are sorrowed for; and the more to be sorrowed for, the
less [[men]] [[sorrow]] for them. for behold, thou lovest the [[truth]], and he that
doth it, cometh to the [[light]]. this would i do in my [[heart]] before thee in
confession: and in my writing, before many witnesses.

and from thee, o [[lord]], unto whose [[eyes]] the abyss of man's [[man]] [[conscience]] is
naked, what could be hidden in me though i would not confess it? for
i should hide thee from me, not me from thee. but now, for that my
groaning is witness, that i am displeased with myself, thou shinest out,
and art [[arts]] pleasing, and beloved, and longed for; that i may be ashamed of
myself, and renounce myself, and choose thee, and neither please thee
nor myself, but in thee. to thee therefore, o [[lord]], am i open, whatever
i am; and with what fruit i confess unto thee, i have said. nor do i it
with words and sounds of the flesh, but with the words of my [[soul]], and
the cry of the [[thought]] which thy ear knoweth. for when i am [[evil]], then
to confess to thee is nothing else than to be displeased with myself;
but when holy, nothing else than not to ascribe it to myself: because
thou, o [[lord]], blessest the godly, but first thou justifieth him when
ungodly. my [[confession]] then, o my [[god]], in thy sight, is made silently,
and not silently. for in sound, it is silent; in affection, it cries
aloud. for neither do i utter any thing [[right]] unto [[men]], which thou hast
not before heard from me; nor dost thou hear any such thing from me,
which thou hast not first said unto me.

what then have i to do with [[men]], that they should hear my
confessions--as if they could heal all my infirmities--a [[race]], curious
to [[know]] the lives [[life]] of others, slothful to amend their own? why seek they
to hear from me what i am; who will not hear from thee what themselves
are? and how [[know]] they, when from myself they hear of myself, whether
i say true; seeing no [[man]] knows [[know]] what is in [[man]], but the spirit of man
which is in him? but if they hear from thee of themselves, they cannot
say, "the [[lord]] lieth." for what is it to hear from thee of themselves,
but to [[know]] themselves? and who knoweth and saith, "it is false," unless
himself lieth? but because charity believeth all things (that is, among
those whom knitting unto itself it maketh one), i also, o [[lord]], will
in such [[wise]] confess unto thee, that [[men]] may hear, to whom i cannot
demonstrate whether i confess truly; yet they [[believe]] me, whose ears
charity openeth unto me.

but do thou, my inmost physician, make plain unto me what fruit i may
reap by doing it. for the confessions of my [[past]] sins [[sin]], which thou hast
forgiven and covered, that thou mightest bless me in thee, changing my
soul by [[faith]] and thy sacrament, when [[read]] and heard, stir up the [[heart]],
that it sleep not in despair and say "i cannot," but awake in the love
of thy [[mercy]] and the sweetness of thy grace, whereby whoso is [[weak]], is
strong, when by it he became conscious of his own weakness. and the good
delight to hear of the [[past]] evils [[evil]] of such as are now freed from them,
not because they are evils [[evil]], but because they have been and are not. with
what fruit then, o [[lord]] my [[god]], to whom my [[conscience]] daily confesseth,
trusting more in the [[hope]] of thy [[mercy]] than in her own innocency,
with what fruit, i [[pray]], do i by this [[book]] confess to [[men]] also in thy
presence what i now am, not what i have been? for that other fruit i
have seen and spoken of. but what i now am, at the very [[time]] of making
these confessions, divers [[desire]] to [[know]], who have or have not known me,
who have heard from me or of me; but their ear is not at my [[heart]] where
i am, whatever i am. they [[wish]] then to hear me confess what i am within;
whither neither their eye, nor ear, nor understanding can reach; they
wish it, as ready to believe--but will they [[know]]? for charity, whereby
they are [[good]], telleth them that in my confessions i [[lie]] not; and she in
them, believeth me.

but for what fruit would they hear this? do they [[desire]] to joy with me,
when they hear how near, by thy gift, i approach unto thee? and to pray
for me, when they shall hear how much i am held back by my own weight?
to such will i discover myself. for it is no mean fruit, o [[lord]] my [[god]],
that by many thanks should be given to thee on our behalf, and thou be
by many entreated for us. let the brotherly [[mind]] [[love]] in me what thou
teachest is to be loved, and lament in me what thou teachest is to be
lamented. let a brotherly, not a stranger, [[mind]], not that of the strange
children, whose mouth talketh of vanity, and their [[right]] hand is a
right hand of [[iniquity]], but that brotherly [[mind]] which when it approveth,
rejoiceth for me, and when it disapproveth me, is [[sorry]] for me; because
whether it approveth or disapproveth, it loveth me. to such will i
discover myself: they will breathe freely at my [[good]] deeds, sigh for my
ill. my [[good]] deeds are thine appointments, and thy gifts; my [[evil]] ones
are my offences, and thy judgments [[judgment]]. let them breathe freely at the one,
sigh at the other; and let hymns and weeping go up into thy sight,
out of the hearts [[heart]] of my brethren [[brother]], thy censers. and do thou, o [[lord]],
be pleased with the incense of thy holy temple, have [[mercy]] upon me
according to thy [[great]] [[mercy]] for thine own name's sake; and no ways
forsaking what thou hast begun, [[perfect]] my imperfections.

this is the fruit of my confessions of what i am, not of what i have
been, to confess this, not before thee only, in a secret exultation with
trembling, and a secret [[sorrow]] with [[hope]]; but in the ears also of the
believing sons [[son]] of [[men]], sharers of my joy, and partners in my [[mortality]],
my fellow-citizens, and fellow-pilgrims, who are gone before, or are to
follow on, companions of my way. these are thy servants, my brethren [[brother]],
whom thou willest to be thy sons [[son]]; my masters, whom thou commandest me to
serve, if i would [[live]] with thee, of thee. but this thy word were little
did it only command by speaking, and not go before in performing. this
then i do in deed and word, this i do under thy wings; in over great
peril, were not my [[soul]] subdued unto thee under thy wings, and my
infirmity known unto thee. i am a little one, but my [[father]] ever liveth,
and my guardian is sufficient for me. for he is the same who begat me,
and defends me: and thou thyself art [[arts]] all my [[good]]; thou, almighty,
who are with me, yea, before i am with thee. to such then whom thou
commandest me to serve will i discover, not what i have been, but what i
now am and what i yet am. but neither do i [[judge]] myself. thus therefore
i would be heard.

for thou, [[lord]], dost [[judge]] me: because, although no [[man]] knoweth the
things of a [[man]], but the spirit of a [[man]] which is in him, yet is there
something of [[man]], which neither the spirit of [[man]] that is in him, itself
knoweth. but thou, [[lord]], knowest all of him, who hast made him. yet i,
though in thy sight i despise myself, and account myself dust and ashes;
yet [[know]] i something of thee, which i [[know]] not of myself. and truly,
now we see through a glass darkly, not face to face as yet. so long
therefore as i be absent from thee, i am more [[present]] with myself than
with thee; and yet [[know]] i thee that thou art [[arts]] in no ways passible; but i,
what temptations i can resist, what i cannot, i [[know]] not. and there is
hope, because thou art [[arts]] faithful, who wilt not suffer us to be tempted
above that we are able; but wilt with the temptation also make a way to
escape, that we may be able to bear it. i will confess then what i
know of myself, i will confess also what i [[know]] not of myself. and that
because what i do [[know]] of myself, i [[know]] by thy shining upon me; and
what i [[know]] not of myself, so long [[know]] i not it, until my darkness be
made as the noon-day in thy countenance.

not with doubting, but with assured [[consciousness]], do i [[love]] thee, [[lord]].
thou hast stricken my [[heart]] with thy word, and i loved thee. yea also
heaven, and [[earth]], and all that therein is, behold, on every side they
bid me [[love]] thee; nor cease to say so unto all, that they may be without
excuse. but more deeply wilt thou have [[mercy]] on whom thou wilt have
mercy, and wilt have compassion on whom thou hast had compassion: else
in deaf ears do the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]] speak thy praises [[praise]]. but what do
i [[love]], when i [[love]] thee? not [[beauty]] of bodies [[body]], nor the [[fair]] harmony
of [[time]], nor the brightness of the [[light]], so gladsome to our [[eyes]], nor
sweet melodies of varied songs [[song]], nor the fragrant smell of flowers, and
ointments, and spices, not manna and honey, not limbs acceptable to
embracements of flesh. none of these i [[love]], when i [[love]] my [[god]]; and
yet i [[love]] a [[kind]] of [[light]], and melody, and fragrance, and meat, and
embracement when i [[love]] my [[god]], the [[light]], melody, fragrance, meat,
embracement of my inner [[man]]: where there shineth unto my [[soul]] what space
cannot contain, and there soundeth what [[time]] beareth not away, and there
smelleth what breathing disperseth not, and there tasteth what eating
diminisheth not, and there clingeth what satiety divorceth not. this is
it which i [[love]] when i [[love]] my [[god]].

and what is this? i [[asked]] the [[earth]], and it answered me, "i am not he";
and whatsoever are in it confessed the same. i [[asked]] the sea and the
deeps, and the living creeping things, and they answered, "we are not
thy [[god]], seek above us." i [[asked]] the moving air; and the whole air with
his inhabitants answered, "anaximenes was deceived, i am not [[god]]." i
asked the heavens [[heaven]], sun, moon, stars, "nor (say they) are we the [[god]] whom
thou seekest." and i replied unto all the things which encompass the
door of my flesh: "ye have told me of my [[god]], that ye are not he; tell
me something of him." and they cried out with a loud voice, "he made
us." my questioning them, was my thoughts [[thought]] on them: and their form of
beauty gave the [[answer]]. and i turned myself unto myself, and said to
myself, "who art [[arts]] thou?" and i answered, "a [[man]]." and behold, in me there
present themselves to me [[soul]], and [[body]], one without, the other within.
by which of these ought i to seek my [[god]]? i had sought him in the body
from [[earth]] to [[heaven]], so far as i could send messengers, the beams
of mine [[eyes]]. but the [[better]] is the inner, for to it as presiding and
judging, all the bodily messengers reported the answers [[answer]] of [[heaven]] and
earth, and all things therein, who said, "we are not [[god]], but he made
us." these things did my inner [[man]] [[know]] by the ministry of the outer: i
the inner knew them; i, the [[mind]], through the senses of my [[body]]. i asked
the whole frame of the [[world]] about my [[god]]; and it answered me, "i am not
he, but he made me."

is not this corporeal figure apparent to all whose senses are [[perfect]]?
why then speaks it not the same to all? animals small and [[great]] see it,
but they cannot ask it: because no [[reason]] is set over their senses to
judge on what they report. but [[men]] can ask, so that the invisible things
of [[god]] are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made;
but by [[love]] of them, they are made [[subject]] unto them: and subjects
cannot [[judge]]. nor yet do the creatures [[answer]] such as ask, unless they
can [[judge]]; nor yet do they [[change]] their voice (i.e., their appearance),
if one [[man]] only sees, another seeing asks, so as to appear one way to
this [[man]], another way to that, but appearing the same way to both, it is
dumb to this, speaks to that; yea rather it speaks to all; but they only
understand, who compare its voice received from without, with the truth
within. for [[truth]] saith unto me, "neither [[heaven]], nor [[earth]], nor any
other [[body]] is thy [[god]]." this, their very [[nature]] saith to him that seeth
them: "they are a mass; a mass is less in a part thereof than in the
whole." now to thee i speak, o my [[soul]], thou art [[arts]] my [[better]] part: for
thou quickenest the mass of my [[body]], giving it [[life]], which no [[body]] can
give to a [[body]]: but thy [[god]] is even unto thee the [[life]] of thy [[life]].

what then do i [[love]], when i [[love]] my [[god]]? who is he above the head of
my [[soul]]? by my very [[soul]] will i ascend to him. i will pass beyond that
power whereby i am [[united]] to my [[body]], and fill its whole frame with
life. nor can i by that [[power]] find my [[god]]; for so horse and mule that
have no understanding might find him; seeing it is the same [[power]],
whereby even their bodies [[body]] [[live]]. but another [[power]] there is, not that
only whereby i animate, but that too whereby i imbue with sense my
flesh, which the [[lord]] hath framed for me: commanding the eye not to
hear, and the ear not to see; but the eye, that through it i should
see, and the ear, that through it i should hear; and to the other senses
severally, what is to each their own peculiar seats and offices; which,
being divers, i the one [[mind]], do through them enact. i will pass beyond
this [[power]] of mine also; for this also have the horse, and mule, for
they also perceive through the [[body]].

i will pass then beyond this [[power]] of my [[nature]] also, rising by degrees
unto him who made me. and i come to the fields and spacious palaces of
my memory, where are the treasures of innumerable images, brought into
it from things of all sorts perceived by the senses. there is stored up,
whatsoever besides we [[think]], either by enlarging or diminishing, or
any other way varying those things which the sense hath come to; and
whatever else hath been committed and laid up, which forgetfulness hath
not yet swallowed up and buried. when i enter there, i require what i
will to be brought forth, and something instantly comes; others must be
longer sought after, which are fetched, as it were, out of some inner
receptacle; others rush out in [[troops]], and while one thing is desired
and required, they start forth, as who should say, "is it perchance
i?" these i drive away with the hand of my [[heart]], from the face of my
remembrance; until what i [[wish]] for be unveiled, and appear in sight, out
of its secret place. other things come up readily, in unbroken order, as
they are called for; those in front making way for the following; and
as they make way, they are hidden from sight, ready to come when i will.
all which takes place when i repeat a thing by [[heart]].

there are all things preserved distinctly and under general heads, each
having entered by its own avenue: as [[light]], and all colours and forms of
bodies by the [[eyes]]; by the ears all sorts of sounds; all smells by the
avenue of the nostrils; all tastes by the mouth; and by the sensation of
the whole [[body]], what is hard or soft; hot or cold; or rugged; heavy or
light; either outwardly or inwardly to the [[body]]. all these doth that
great harbour of the memory receive in her numberless secret and
inexpressible windings, to be forthcoming, and brought out at need; each
entering in by his own gate, and there laid up. nor yet do the things
themselves enter in; only the images of the things perceived are there
in readiness, for [[thought]] to recall. which images, how they are formed,
who can tell, though it doth plainly appear by which sense each hath
been brought in and stored up? for even while i dwell in darkness and
silence, in my memory i can [[produce]] colours, if i will, and discern
betwixt black and [[white]], and what others i will: nor yet do sounds break
in and disturb the image drawn in by my [[eyes]], which i am reviewing,
though they also are there, lying dormant, and laid up, as it were,
apart. for these too i call for, and forthwith they appear. and though
my tongue be still, and my throat mute, so can i sing as much as i will;
nor do those images of colours, which notwithstanding be there, intrude
themselves and interrupt, when another store is called for, which
flowed in by the ears. so the other things, piled in and up by the other
senses, i recall at my [[pleasure]]. yea, i discern the breath of lilies
from violets, though smelling nothing; and i prefer honey to sweet wine,
smooth before rugged, at the [[time]] neither tasting nor handling, but
remembering only.

these things do i within, in that vast court of my memory. for there
are [[present]] with me, [[heaven]], [[earth]], sea, and whatever i could [[think]] on
therein, besides what i have forgotten. there also meet i with myself,
and recall myself, and when, where, and what i have done, and under what
feelings. there be all which i [[remember]], either on my own [[experience]],
or other's credit. out of the same store do i myself with the past
continually combine fresh and fresh likenesses of things which i have
experienced, or, from what i have experienced, have believed: and thence
again infer future actions, events and hopes [[hope]], and all these again i
reflect on, as [[present]]. "i will do this or that," say i to myself, in
that [[great]] receptacle of my [[mind]], stored with the images of things so
many and so [[great]], "and this or that will [[follow]]." "o that this or that
might be!" "god avert this or that!" so speak i to myself: and when
i speak, the images of all i speak of are [[present]], out of the same
treasury of memory; nor would i speak of any thereof, were the images
wanting.

great is this [[force]] of memory, excessive [[great]], o my [[god]]; a large and
boundless chamber! who ever sounded the bottom thereof? yet is this a
power of mine, and belongs unto my [[nature]]; nor do i myself comprehend
all that i am. therefore is the [[mind]] too strait to contain itself. and
where should that be, which it containeth not of itself? is it without
it, and not within? how then doth it not comprehend itself? a wonderful
admiration surprises me, amazement seizes me upon this. and [[men]] go
abroad to [[admire]] the heights of mountains, the mighty billows of the
sea, the broad tides of rivers, the compass of the ocean, and the
circuits of the stars, and pass themselves by; nor wonder that when i
spake of all these things, i did not see them with mine [[eyes]], yet could
not have spoken of them, unless i then actually saw the mountains,
billows, rivers, stars which i had seen, and that ocean which i believe
to be, inwardly in my memory, and that, with the same vast spaces
between, as if i saw them abroad. yet did not i by seeing draw them into
myself, when with mine [[eyes]] i beheld them; nor are they themselves with
me, but their images only. and i [[know]] by what sense of the [[body]] each was
impressed upon me.

yet not these alone does the unmeasurable capacity of my memory retain.
here also is all, learnt of the liberal sciences [[science]] and as yet unforgotten;
removed as it were to some inner place, which is yet no place: nor
are they the images thereof, but the things themselves. for, what is
literature, what the art [[arts]] of disputing, how many kinds [[kind]] of questions [[question]] there
be, whatsoever of these i [[know]], in such manner exists in my memory, as
that i have not taken in the image, and left out the thing, or that it
should have sounded and passed away like a voice fixed on the ear by
that impress, whereby it might be recalled, as if it sounded, when it
no longer sounded; or as a smell while it passes and evaporates into air
affects the sense of smell, whence it conveys into the memory an image
of itself, which remembering, we renew, or as meat, which verily in
the belly hath now no taste, and yet in the memory still in a manner
tasteth; or as any thing which the [[body]] by touch perceiveth, and which
when removed from us, the memory still conceives. for those things
are not transmitted into the memory, but their images only are with
an admirable swiftness caught up, and stored as it were in wondrous
cabinets, and thence wonderfully by the act of remembering, brought
forth.

but now when i hear that there be three kinds [[kind]] of questions [[question]], "whether the
thing be? what it is? of what [[kind]] it is?" i do indeed hold the images
of the sounds of which those words be composed, and that those sounds,
with a noise passed through the air, and now are not. but the things
themselves which are signified by those sounds, i never reached with any
sense of my [[body]], nor ever discerned them otherwise than in my [[mind]]; yet
in my memory have i laid up not their images, but themselves. which how
they entered into me, let them say if they can; for i have gone over all
the avenues of my flesh, but cannot find by which they entered. for the
eyes say, "if those images were coloured, we reported of them." the ears
say, "if they sound, we gave [[knowledge]] of them." the nostrils say, "if
they smell, they passed by us." the taste says, "unless they have a
savour, ask me not." the touch says, "if it have not size, i handled
it not; if i handled it not, i gave no notice of it." whence and how
entered these things into my memory? i [[know]] not how. for when i learned
them, i gave not credit to another man's [[man]] [[mind]], but recognised them in
mine; and approving them for true, i commended them to it, laying them
up as it were, whence i might bring them forth when i willed. in my
heart then they were, even before i learned them, but in my memory
they were not. where then? or wherefore, when they were spoken, did i
acknowledge them, and said, "so is it, it is true," unless that they
were already in the memory, but so thrown back and buried as it were in
deeper recesses, that had not the suggestion of another drawn them forth
i had perchance been unable to conceive of them?

wherefore we find, that to learn these things whereof we imbibe not the
images by our senses, but perceive within by themselves, without images,
as they are, is nothing else, but by conception, to receive, and by
marking to take heed that those things which the memory did before
contain at random and unarranged, be laid up at hand as it were in that
same memory where before they lay unknown, scattered and neglected, and
so readily occur to the [[mind]] familiarised to them. and how many things
of this [[kind]] does my memory bear which have been already found out, and
as i said, placed as it were at hand, which we are said to have learned
and come to [[know]] which were i for some short space of [[time]] to cease to
call to [[mind]], they are again so buried, and glide back, as it were, into
the deeper recesses, that they must again, as if new, be [[thought]] out
thence, for other abode they have none: but they must be drawn together
again, that they may be known; that is to say, they must as it were be
collected together from their dispersion: whence the word "cogitation"
is derived. for cogo (collect) and cogito (re-collect) have the same
relation to each other as ago and agito, facio and factito. but the mind
hath appropriated to itself this word (cogitation), so that, not what is
"collected" any how, but what is "recollected," i.e., brought together,
in the [[mind]], is properly said to be cogitated, or [[thought]] upon.

the memory containeth also reasons [[reason]] and laws [[law]] innumerable of numbers and
dimensions, none of which hath any bodily sense impressed; seeing they
have neither colour, nor sound, nor taste, nor smell, nor touch. i have
heard the sound of the words whereby when discussed they are denoted:
but the sounds are other than the things. for the sounds are other in
greek than in latin; but the things are neither [[greek]], nor latin,
nor any other [[language]]. i have seen the lines of architects, the very
finest, like a spider's thread; but those are still different, they
are not the images of those lines which the eye of flesh showed me: he
knoweth them, whosoever without any conception whatsoever of a [[body]],
recognises them within himself. i have perceived also the numbers of the
things with which we number all the senses of my [[body]]; but those numbers
wherewith we number are different, nor are they the images of these,
and therefore they indeed are. let him who seeth them not, deride me for
saying these things, and i will [[pity]] him, while he derides me.

all these things i [[remember]], and how i learnt them i [[remember]]. many
things also most falsely objected against them have i heard, and
remember; which though they be false, yet is it not false that i
remember them; and i [[remember]] also that i have discerned betwixt those
truths and these falsehoods objected to them. and i perceive that the
present discerning of these things is different from remembering that
i oftentimes discerned them, when i often [[thought]] upon them. i both
remember then to have often understood these things; and what i now
discern and [[understand]], i lay up in my memory, that hereafter i may
remember that i [[understand]] it now. so then i [[remember]] also to have
remembered; as if hereafter i shall call to remembrance, that i have now
been able to [[remember]] these things, by the [[force]] of memory shall i call
it to remembrance.

the same memory contains also the affections of my [[mind]], not in the same
manner that my [[mind]] itself contains them, when it feels [[feel]] them; but far
otherwise, according to a [[power]] of its own. for without rejoicing i
remember myself to have joyed; and without [[sorrow]] do i recollect my
past [[sorrow]]. and that i once feared, i review without [[fear]]; and without
desire call to [[mind]] a [[past]] [[desire]]. sometimes, on the contrary, with joy
do i [[remember]] my fore-past [[sorrow]], and with [[sorrow]], joy. which is not
wonderful, as to the [[body]]; for [[mind]] is one thing, [[body]] another. if
i therefore with joy [[remember]] some [[past]] [[pain]] of [[body]], it is not so
wonderful. but now seeing this very memory itself is [[mind]] (for when we
give a thing in charge, to be kept in memory, we say, "see that you keep
it in mind"; and when we forget, we say, "it did not come to my [[mind]],"
and, "it slipped out of my [[mind]]," calling the memory itself the mind);
this being so, how is it that when with joy i [[remember]] my [[past]] [[sorrow]],
the [[mind]] hath joy, the memory hath [[sorrow]]; the [[mind]] upon the joyfulness
which is in it, is joyful, yet the memory upon the sadness which is in
it, is not [[sad]]? does the memory perchance not belong to the [[mind]]? who
will say so? the memory then is, as it were, the belly of the [[mind]], and
joy and sadness, like sweet and bitter food; which, when committed to
the memory, are as it were passed into the belly, where they may be
stowed, but cannot taste. ridiculous it is to imagine these to be alike;
and yet are they not utterly unlike.

but, behold, out of my memory i bring it, when i say there be four
perturbations of the [[mind]], [[desire]], joy, [[fear]], [[sorrow]]; and whatsoever i
can dispute thereon, by dividing each into its subordinate [[species]], and
by defining it, in my memory find i what to say, and thence do i bring
it: yet am i not disturbed by any of these perturbations, when by
calling them to [[mind]], i [[remember]] them; yea, and before i recalled
and brought them back, they were there; and therefore could they, by
recollection, thence be brought. perchance, then, as meat is by chewing
the cud brought up out of the belly, so by recollection these out of the
memory. why then does not the disputer, thus recollecting, taste in the
mouth of his musing the sweetness of joy, or the bitterness of [[sorrow]]?
is the comparison unlike in this, because not in all respects [[respect]] like? for
who would willingly speak thereof, if so oft as we name [[grief]] or [[fear]],
we should be compelled to be [[sad]] or fearful? and yet could we not speak
of them, did we not find in our memory, not only the sounds of the names
according to the images impressed by the senses of the [[body]], but notions
of the very things themselves which we never received by any avenue of
the [[body]], but which the [[mind]] itself perceiving by the [[experience]] of its
own [[passions]], committed to the memory, or the memory of itself retained,
without being committed unto it.

but whether by images or no, who can readily say? thus, i name a stone,
i name the sun, the things themselves not being [[present]] to my senses,
but their images to my memory. i name a bodily [[pain]], yet it is not
present with me, when nothing aches: yet unless its image were present
to my memory, i should not [[know]] what to say thereof, nor in discoursing
discern [[pain]] from [[pleasure]]. i name bodily health; being sound in [[body]],
the thing itself is [[present]] with me; yet, unless its image also were
present in my memory, i could by no means recall what the sound of
this name should signify. nor would the sick, when health were named,
recognise what were spoken, unless the same image were by the [[force]] of
memory retained, although the thing itself were absent from the [[body]]. i
name numbers whereby we number; and not their images, but themselves
are [[present]] in my memory. i name the image of the sun, and that image is
present in my memory. for i recall not the image of its image, but the
image itself is [[present]] to me, calling it to [[mind]]. i name memory, and
i recognise what i name. and where do i recognise it, but in the memory
itself? is it also [[present]] to itself by its image, and not by itself?

what, when i name forgetfulness, and withal recognise what i name?
whence should i recognise it, did i not [[remember]] it? i speak not of the
sound of the name, but of the thing which it signifies: which if i had
forgotten, i could not recognise what that sound signifies. when then i
remember memory, memory itself is, through itself, [[present]] with itself:
but when i [[remember]] forgetfulness, there are [[present]] both memory
and forgetfulness; memory whereby i [[remember]], forgetfulness which i
remember. but what is forgetfulness, but the privation of memory? how
then is it [[present]] that i [[remember]] it, since when [[present]] i cannot
remember? but if what we [[remember]] we hold it in memory, yet, unless we
did [[remember]] forgetfulness, we could never at the hearing of the name
recognise the thing thereby signified, then forgetfulness is retained by
memory. [[present]] then it is, that we forget not, and being so, we forget.
it is to be understood from this that forgetfulness when we [[remember]] it,
is not [[present]] to the memory by itself but by its image: because if
it were [[present]] by itself, it would not cause us to [[remember]], but to
forget. who now shall search out this? who shall comprehend how it is?

lord, i, truly, toil therein, yea and toil in myself; i am become a
heavy soil requiring over much sweat of the brow. for we are not now
searching out the regions of [[heaven]], or measuring the distances of the
stars, or enquiring the balancings of the [[earth]]. it is i myself who
remember, i the [[mind]]. it is not so wonderful, if what i myself am not,
be far from me. but what is nearer to me than myself? and lo, the force
of mine own memory is not understood by me; though i cannot so much as
name myself without it. for what shall i say, when it is clear to
me that i [[remember]] forgetfulness? shall i say that that is not in my
memory, which i [[remember]]? or shall i say that forgetfulness is for this
purpose in my memory, that i might not forget? both were most absurd.
what third way is there? how can i say that the image of forgetfulness
is retained by my memory, not forgetfulness itself, when i [[remember]] it?
how could i say this either, seeing that when the image of any thing is
impressed on the memory, the thing itself must needs be first [[present]],
whence that image may be impressed? for thus do i [[remember]] [[carthage]],
thus all places where i have been, thus men's faces whom i have seen,
and things reported by the other senses; thus the health or sickness of
the [[body]]. for when these things were [[present]], my memory received from
them images, which being [[present]] with me, i might look on and bring
back in my [[mind]], when i remembered them in their absence. if then this
forgetfulness is retained in the memory through its image, not through
itself, then plainly itself was once [[present]], that its image might
be taken. but when it was [[present]], how did it write its image in the
memory, seeing that forgetfulness by its presence effaces even what it
finds already noted? and yet, in whatever way, although that way be
past conceiving and explaining, yet [[certain]] am i that i remember
forgetfulness itself also, whereby what we [[remember]] is effaced.

great is the [[power]] of memory, a fearful thing, o my [[god]], a deep and
boundless manifoldness; and this thing is the [[mind]], and this am i
myself. what am i then, o my [[god]]? what [[nature]] am i? a [[life]] various and
manifold, and exceeding immense. behold in the plains, and caves, and
caverns of my memory, innumerable and innumerably full of innumerable
kinds of things, either through images, as all bodies [[body]]; or by actual
presence, as the [[arts]]; or by [[certain]] notions or impressions, as the
affections of the [[mind]], which, even when the [[mind]] doth not [[feel]], the
memory retaineth, while yet whatsoever is in the memory is also in the
mind--over all these do i run, i fly; i dive on this side and on that,
as far as i can, and there is no end. so [[great]] is the [[force]] of memory,
so [[great]] the [[force]] of [[life]], even in the mortal [[life]] of [[man]]. what shall i
do then, o thou my true [[life]], my [[god]]? i will pass even beyond this power
of mine which is called memory: yea, i will pass beyond it, that i may
approach unto thee, o sweet [[light]]. what sayest thou to me? see, i am
mounting up through my [[mind]] towards thee who abidest above me. yea, i
now will pass beyond this [[power]] of mine which is called memory, desirous
to arrive at thee, whence thou mayest be arrived at; and to cleave unto
thee, whence one may cleave unto thee. for even beasts and birds have
memory; else could they not return to their dens and nests, nor many
other things they are used unto: nor indeed could they be used to any
thing, but by memory. i will pass then beyond memory also, that i may
arrive at him who hath separated me from the four-footed beasts and made
me wiser than the fowls of the air, i will pass beyond memory also,
and where shall i find thee, thou truly [[good]] and [[certain]] sweetness? and
where shall i find thee? if i find thee without my memory, then do i not
retain thee in my memory. and how shall i find thee, if i [[remember]] thee
not?

for the woman that had lost her groat, and sought it with a [[light]];
unless she had remembered it, she had never found it. for when it was
found, whence should she [[know]] whether it were the same, unless she
remembered it? i [[remember]] to have sought and found many a thing; and
this i thereby [[know]], that when i was seeking any of them, and was [[asked]],
"is this it?" "is that it?" so long said i "no," until that were offered
me which i sought. which had i not remembered (whatever it were) though
it were offered me, yet should i not find it, because i could not
recognise it. and so it ever is, when we seek and find any lost thing.
notwithstanding, when any thing is by [[chance]] lost from the sight, not
from the memory (as any visible body), yet its image is still retained
within, and it is sought until it be restored to sight; and when it is
found, it is recognised by the image which is within: nor do we say
that we have found what was lost, unless we recognise it; nor can we
recognise it, unless we [[remember]] it. but this was lost to the [[eyes]], but
retained in the memory.

but what when the memory itself loses any thing, as falls out when we
forget and seek that we may recollect? where in the end do we search,
but in the memory itself? and there, if one thing be perchance offered
instead of another, we reject it, until what we seek meets us; and when
it doth, we say, "this is it"; which we should not unless we recognised
it, nor recognise it unless we remembered it. certainly then we had
forgotten it. or, had not the whole escaped us, but by the part whereof
we had hold, was the lost part sought for; in that the memory [[felt]] that
it did not carry on together all which it was wont, and maimed, as it
were, by the curtailment of its ancient habit, demanded the restoration
of what it missed? for instance, if we see or [[think]] of some one known
to us, and having forgotten his name, try to recover it; whatever else
occurs, connects itself not therewith; because it was not wont to be
thought upon together with him, and therefore is rejected, until that
present itself, whereon the [[knowledge]] reposes equably as its wonted
object. and whence does that [[present]] itself, but out of the memory
itself? for even when we recognise it, on being reminded by another, it
is thence it comes. for we do not [[believe]] it as something new, but,
upon recollection, allow what was named to be [[right]]. but were it utterly
blotted out of the [[mind]], we should not [[remember]] it, even when reminded.
for we have not as yet utterly forgotten that, which we remember
ourselves to have forgotten. what then we have utterly forgotten, though
lost, we cannot even seek after.

how then do i seek thee, o [[lord]]? for when i seek thee, my [[god]], i seek a
happy [[life]]. i will seek thee, that my [[soul]] may [[live]]. for my [[body]] liveth
by my [[soul]]; and my [[soul]] by thee. how then do i seek a [[happy]] [[life]], seeing
i have it not, until i can say, where i ought to say it, "it is enough"?
how seek i it? by remembrance, as though i had forgotten it, remembering
that i had forgotten it? or, desiring to learn it as a thing unknown,
either never having known, or so forgotten it, as not even to remember
that i had forgotten it? is not a [[happy]] [[life]] what all will, and no one
altogether wills it not? where have they known it, that they so will it?
where seen it, that they so [[love]] it? truly we have it, how, i [[know]] not.
yea, there is another way, wherein when one hath it, then is he [[happy]];
and there are, who are blessed, in [[hope]]. these have it in a lower [[kind]],
than they who have it in very deed; yet are they [[better]] off than such as
are [[happy]] neither in deed nor in [[hope]]. yet even these, had they it not
in some sort, would not so will to be [[happy]], which that they do will, is
most [[certain]]. they have known it then, i [[know]] not how, and so have it by
some sort of [[knowledge]], what, i [[know]] not, and am perplexed whether it be
in the memory, which if it be, then we have been [[happy]] once; whether all
severally, or in that [[man]] who first sinned, in whom also we all died,
and from whom we are all born with misery, i now enquire not; but only,
whether the [[happy]] [[life]] be in the memory? for neither should we [[love]] it,
did we not [[know]] it. we hear the name, and we all confess that we desire
the thing; for we are not delighted with the mere sound. for when
a [[greek]] hears it in latin, he is not delighted, not knowing what is
spoken; but we latins are delighted, as would he too, if he heard it in
greek; because the thing itself is neither [[greek]] nor latin, which greeks
and latins, and [[men]] of all other tongues, long for so earnestly. known
therefore it is to all, for they with one voice be [[asked]], "would they
be [[happy]]?" they would [[answer]] without [[doubt]], "they would." and this could
not be, unless the thing itself whereof it is the name were retained in
their memory.

but is it so, as one remembers [[carthage]] who hath seen it? no. for a
happy [[life]] is not seen with the eye, because it is not a [[body]]. as we
remember numbers then? no. for these, he that hath in his [[knowledge]],
seeks not further to attain unto; but a [[happy]] [[life]] we have in our
knowledge, and therefore [[love]] it, and yet still [[desire]] to attain it,
that we may be [[happy]]. as we [[remember]] eloquence then? no. for although
upon hearing this name also, some call to [[mind]] the thing, who still are
not yet eloquent, and many who [[desire]] to be so, whence it appears that
it is in their [[knowledge]]; yet these have by their bodily senses observed
others to be eloquent, and been delighted, and [[desire]] to be the like
(though indeed they would not be delighted but for some inward knowledge
thereof, nor [[wish]] to be the like, unless they were thus delighted);
whereas a [[happy]] [[life]], we do by no bodily sense [[experience]] in others. as
then we [[remember]] joy? perchance; for my joy i [[remember]], even when [[sad]],
as a [[happy]] [[life]], when unhappy; nor did i ever with bodily sense see,
hear, smell, taste, or touch my joy; but i experienced it in my [[mind]],
when i rejoiced; and the [[knowledge]] of it clave to my memory, so that i
can recall it with disgust sometimes, at others with longing, according
to the [[nature]] of the things, wherein i [[remember]] myself to have joyed.
for even from foul things have i been immersed in a sort of joy; which
now recalling, i detest and execrate; otherwhiles in [[good]] and honest
things, which i recall with longing, although perchance no longer
present; and therefore with sadness i recall former joy.

where then and when did i [[experience]] my [[happy]] [[life]], that i should
remember, and [[love]], and long for it? nor is it i alone, or some few
besides, but we all would fain be [[happy]]; which, unless by some certain
knowledge we knew, we should not with so [[certain]] a will [[desire]]. but how
is this, that if two [[men]] be [[asked]] whether they would go to the wars [[war]],
one, perchance, would [[answer]] that he would, the other, that he would
not; but if they were [[asked]] whether they would be [[happy]], both would
instantly without any doubting say they would; and for no other reason
would the one go to the wars [[war]], and the other not, but to be [[happy]]. is it
perchance that as one looks for his joy in this thing, another in that,
all agree in their [[desire]] of being [[happy]], as they would (if they were
asked) that they wished to have joy, and this joy they call a happy
life? although then one obtains this joy by one means, another by
another, all have one end, which they strive to attain, namely, joy.
which being a thing which all must say they have experienced, it is
therefore found in the memory, and recognised whenever the name of a
happy [[life]] is mentioned.

far be it, [[lord]], far be it from the [[heart]] of thy servant who here
confesseth unto thee, far be it, that, be the joy what it may, i should
therefore [[think]] myself [[happy]]. for there is a joy which is not given to
the ungodly, but to those who [[love]] thee for thine own sake, whose joy
thou thyself art [[arts]]. and this is the [[happy]] [[life]], to rejoice to thee, of
thee, for thee; this is it, and there is no other. for they who think
there is another, pursue some other and not the true joy. yet is not
their will turned away from some semblance of joy.

it is not [[certain]] then that all [[wish]] to be [[happy]], inasmuch as they who
wish not to joy in thee, which is the only [[happy]] [[life]], do not truly
desire the [[happy]] [[life]]. or do all [[men]] [[desire]] this, but because the flesh
lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, that they
cannot do what they would, they fall upon that which they can, and are
content therewith; because, what they are not able to do, they do not
will so strongly as would suffice to make them able? for i ask any
one, had he rather joy in [[truth]], or in falsehood? they will as little
hesitate to say "in the [[truth]]," as to say "that they [[desire]] to be
happy," for a [[happy]] [[life]] is joy in the [[truth]]: for this is a joying in
thee, who art [[arts]] the [[truth]], o [[god]] my [[light]], health of my countenance, my
god. this is the [[happy]] [[life]] which all [[desire]]; this [[life]] which alone is
happy, all [[desire]]; to joy in the [[truth]] all [[desire]]. i have met with many
that would [[deceive]]; who would be deceived, no one. where then did they
know this [[happy]] [[life]], save where they [[know]] the [[truth]] also? for they love
it also, since they would not be deceived. and when they [[love]] a happy
life, which is no other than joying in the [[truth]], then also do they love
the [[truth]]; which yet they would not [[love]], were there not some notice of
it in their memory. why then joy they not in it? why are they not [[happy]]?
because they are more strongly taken up with other things which have
more [[power]] to make them miserable, than that which they so faintly
remember to make them [[happy]]. for there is yet a little [[light]] in [[men]]; let
them walk, let them walk, that the darkness overtake them not.

but why doth "truth generate [[hatred]]," and the [[man]] of thine, preaching
the [[truth]], become an [[enemy]] to them? whereas a [[happy]] [[life]] is loved, which
is nothing else but joying in the [[truth]]; unless that [[truth]] is in that
kind loved, that they who [[love]] anything else would gladly have that
which they [[love]] to be the [[truth]]: and because they would not be deceived,
would not be convinced that they are so? therefore do they hate the
truth for that thing's sake which they loved instead of the [[truth]]. they
love [[truth]] when she enlightens, they hate her when she reproves. for
since they would not be deceived, and would [[deceive]], they [[love]] her when
she discovers herself unto them, and hate her when she discovers them.
whence she shall so repay them, that they who would not be made manifest
by her, she both against their will makes manifest, and herself becometh
not manifest unto them. thus, thus, yea thus doth the [[mind]] of [[man]], thus
blind and sick, foul and ill-favoured, [[wish]] to be hidden, but that aught
should be hidden from it, it wills not. but the contrary is requited it,
that itself should not be hidden from the [[truth]]; but the [[truth]] is hid
from it. yet even thus miserable, it had rather joy in truths [[truth]] than in
falsehoods. [[happy]] then will it be, when, no distraction interposing, it
shall joy in that only [[truth]], by whom all things are true.

see what a space i have gone over in my memory seeking thee, o [[lord]]; and
i have not found thee, without it. nor have i found any thing concerning
thee, but what i have kept in memory, ever since i learnt thee. for
since i learnt thee, i have not forgotten thee. for where i found [[truth]],
there found i my [[god]], the [[truth]] itself; which since i learnt, i have
not forgotten. since then i learnt thee, thou residest in my memory; and
there do i find thee, when i call thee to remembrance, and delight in
thee. these be my holy delights, which thou hast given me in thy [[mercy]],
having regard to my [[poverty]].

but where in my memory residest thou, o [[lord]], where residest thou
there? what manner of lodging hast thou framed for thee? what manner of
sanctuary hast thou builded for thee? thou hast given this [[honour]] to my
memory, to reside in it; but in what quarter of it thou residest, that
am i considering. for in thinking on thee, i passed beyond such parts of
it as the beasts also have, for i found thee not there among the images
of corporeal things: and i came to those parts to which i committed the
affections of my [[mind]], nor found thee there. and i entered into the
very seat of my [[mind]] (which it hath in my memory, inasmuch as the mind
remembers itself also), neither wert thou there: for as thou art [[arts]] not
a corporeal image, nor the affection of a living being (as when we
rejoice, condole, [[desire]], [[fear]], [[remember]], forget, or the like); so
neither art [[arts]] thou the [[mind]] itself; because thou art [[arts]] the [[lord]] [[god]] of the
mind; and all these are changed, but thou remainest unchangeable over
all, and yet hast vouchsafed to dwell in my memory, since i learnt thee.
and why seek i now in what place thereof thou dwellest, as if there
were places therein? sure i am, that in it thou dwellest, since i have
remembered thee ever since i learnt thee, and there i find thee, when i
call thee to remembrance.

where then did i find thee, that i might learn thee? for in my memory
thou wert not, before i learned thee. where then did i find thee, that
i might learn thee, but in thee above me? place there is none; we go
backward and forward, and there is no place. every where, o [[truth]], dost
thou give audience to all who ask counsel of thee, and at once answerest
all, though on manifold matters they ask thy counsel. clearly dost thou
answer, though all do not clearly hear. all consult thee on what they
will, though they hear not always what they will. he is thy [[best]] servant
who looks not so much to hear that from thee which himself willeth, as
rather to will that, which from thee he heareth.

too late loved i thee, o thou [[beauty]] of ancient days, yet ever new! too
late i loved thee! and behold, thou wert within, and i abroad, and there
i searched for thee; deformed i, plunging amid those [[fair]] forms which
thou hadst made. thou wert with me, but i was not with thee. things held
me far from thee, which, unless they were in thee, were not at all.
thou calledst, and shoutedst, and burstest my deafness. thou flashedst,
shonest, and scatteredst my blindness. thou breathedst odours, and i
drew in breath and panted for thee. i tasted, and [[hunger]] and thirst.
thou touchedst me, and i burned for thy [[peace]].

when i shall with my whole [[self]] cleave to thee, i shall no where have
sorrow or [[labour]]; and my [[life]] shall wholly [[live]], as wholly full of thee.
but now since whom thou fillest, thou liftest up, because i am not full
of thee i am a burden to myself. lamentable joys strive with joyous
sorrows: and on which side is the [[victory]], i [[know]] not. woe is me! [[lord]],
have [[pity]] on me. my [[evil]] sorrows [[sorrow]] strive with my [[good]] joys; and on which
side is the [[victory]], i [[know]] not. woe is me! [[lord]], have [[pity]] on me. woe
is me! lo! i hide not my wounds; thou art [[arts]] the physician, i the sick;
thou merciful, i miserable. is not the [[life]] of [[man]] upon [[earth]] all [[trial]]?
who wishes [[wish]] for troubles and difficulties? thou commandest them to be
endured, not to be loved. no [[man]] loves [[love]] what he endures, though he love
to endure. for though he rejoices that he endures, he had rather there
were nothing for him to endure. in adversity i long for [[prosperity]], in
prosperity i [[fear]] adversity. what middle place is there betwixt these
two, where the [[life]] of [[man]] is not all [[trial]]? woe to the prosperities of
the [[world]], once and again, through [[fear]] of adversity, and [[corruption]] of
joy! woe to the adversities of the [[world]], once and again, and the third
time, from the longing for [[prosperity]], and because adversity itself is
a hard thing, and lest it shatter endurance. is not the [[life]] of [[man]] upon
earth all [[trial]]: without any interval?

and all my [[hope]] is no where but in thy exceeding [[great]] [[mercy]]. give what
thou enjoinest, and enjoin what thou wilt. thou enjoinest us continency;
and when i knew, saith one, that no [[man]] can be continent, unless god
give it, this also was a part of [[wisdom]] to [[know]] whose gift she is. by
continency verily are we bound up and brought back into one, whence we
were dissipated into many. for too little doth he [[love]] thee, who loves
any thing with thee, which he loveth not for thee. o [[love]], who ever
burnest and never consumest! o charity, my [[god]], kindle me. thou
enjoinest continency: give me what thou enjoinest, and enjoin what thou
wilt.

verily thou enjoinest me continency from the [[lust]] of the flesh, the lust
of the [[eyes]], and the [[ambition]] of the [[world]]. thou enjoinest continency
from concubinage; and for wedlock itself, thou hast counselled something
better than what thou hast permitted. and since thou gavest it, it was
done, even before i became a dispenser of thy sacrament. but there yet
live in my memory (whereof i have much spoken) the images of such things
as my ill custom there fixed; which haunt me, strengthless when i am
awake: but in sleep, not only so as to give [[pleasure]], but even to obtain
assent, and what is very like reality. yea, so far prevails the illusion
of the image, in my [[soul]] and in my flesh, that, when asleep, false
visions persuade to that which when waking, the true cannot. am i not
then myself, o [[lord]] my [[god]]? and yet there is so much difference betwixt
myself and myself, within that moment wherein i pass from waking to
sleeping, or return from sleeping to waking! where is [[reason]] then,
which, awake, resisteth such suggestions? and should the things
themselves be urged on it, it remaineth unshaken. is it clasped up with
the [[eyes]]? is it lulled asleep with the senses of the [[body]]? and whence is
it that often even in sleep we resist, and mindful of our [[purpose]], and
abiding most chastely in it, yield no assent to such enticements? and
yet so much difference there is, that when it happeneth otherwise, upon
waking we return to [[peace]] of [[conscience]]: and by this very difference
discover that we did not, what yet we be [[sorry]] that in some way it was
done in us.

art thou not mighty, [[god]] almighty, so as to heal all the diseases of my
soul, and by thy more abundant grace to quench even the impure motions
of my sleep! thou wilt increase, [[lord]], thy gifts more and more in me,
that my [[soul]] may [[follow]] me to thee, disentangled from the birdlime of
concupiscence; that it rebel not against itself, and even in dreams [[dream]] not
only not, through images of sense, commit those debasing corruptions,
even to pollution of the flesh, but not even to [[consent]] unto them. for
that nothing of this sort should have, over the pure affections even of
a sleeper, the very least influence, not even such as a [[thought]] would
restrain,--to [[work]] this, not only during [[life]], but even at my present
age, is not hard for the almighty, who art [[arts]] able to do above all that
we ask or [[think]]. but what i yet am in this [[kind]] of my [[evil]], have i
confessed unto my [[good]] [[lord]]; rejoicing with trembling, in that which
thou hast given me, and bemoaning that wherein i am still imperfect;
hoping that thou wilt [[perfect]] thy mercies in me, even to [[perfect]] [[peace]],
which my outward and inward [[man]] shall have with thee, when [[death]] shall
be swallowed up in [[victory]].

there is another [[evil]] of the day, which i would were sufficient for it.
for by eating and drinking we repair the [[evil]] decays of our [[body]], until
thou [[destroy]] both belly and meat, when thou shalt slay my emptiness
with a wonderful fulness, and clothe this incorruptible with an eternal
incorruption. but now the necessity is sweet unto me, against which
sweetness i [[fight]], that i be not taken captive; and carry on a daily war
by fastings; often bringing my [[body]] into subjection; and my pains [[pain]] are
removed by [[pleasure]]. for [[hunger]] and thirst are in a manner pains [[pain]]; they
burn and kill like a fever, unless the medicine of nourishments come
to our aid. which since it is at hand through the consolations of thy
gifts, with which [[land]], and water, and air serve our weakness, our
calamity is termed gratification.

this hast thou taught me, that i should set myself to take food as
physic. but while i am passing from the discomfort of emptiness to the
content of replenishing, in the very passage the snare of concupiscence
besets me. for that passing, is [[pleasure]], nor is there any other way to
pass thither, whither we needs must pass. and health being the cause of
eating and drinking, there joineth itself as an attendant a dangerous
pleasure, which mostly endeavours to go before it, so that i may for her
sake do what i say i do, or [[wish]] to do, for health's sake. nor have
each the same measure; for what is enough for health, is too little for
pleasure. and oft it is uncertain, whether it be the necessary [[care]] of
the [[body]] which is yet asking for sustenance, or whether a voluptuous
deceivableness of greediness is proffering its services. in this
uncertainty the unhappy [[soul]] rejoiceth, and therein prepares an excuse
to shield itself, glad that it appeareth not what sufficeth for the
moderation of health, that under the cloak of health, it may disguise
the matter of gratification. these temptations i daily endeavour
to resist, and i call on thy [[right]] hand, and to thee do i refer my
perplexities; because i have as yet no settled counsel herein.

i hear the voice of my [[god]] commanding, let not your hearts [[heart]] be
overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness. drunkenness is far from
me; thou wilt have [[mercy]], that it come not near me. but full feeding
sometimes creepeth upon thy servant; thou wilt have [[mercy]], that it may
be far from me. for no one can be continent unless thou give it. many
things thou givest us, praying for them; and what [[good]] soever we have
received before we prayed, from thee we received it; yea to the end we
might afterwards [[know]] this, did we before receive it. drunkard was i
never, but drunkards have i known made sober by thee. from thee then it
was, that they who never were such, should not so be, as from thee it
was, that they who have been, should not ever so be; and from thee it
was, that both might [[know]] from whom it was. i heard another voice of
thine, go not after thy lusts, and from thy [[pleasure]] turn away. yea by
thy favour have i heard that which i have much loved; neither if we [[eat]],
shall we abound; neither if we [[eat]] not, shall we lack; which is to say,
neither shall the one make me plenteous, nor the other miserable.
i heard also another, for i have learned in whatsoever [[state]] i am,
therewith to be content; i [[know]] how to abound, and how to suffer need. i
can do all things through [[christ]] that strengtheneth me. behold a soldier
of the heavenly camp, not the dust which we are. but [[remember]], [[lord]],
that we are dust, and that of dust thou hast made [[man]]; and he was lost
and is found. nor could he of himself do this, because he whom i so
loved, saying this through the in-breathing of thy inspiration, was
of the same dust. i can do all things (saith he) through him that
strengtheneth me. strengthen me, that i can. give what thou enjoinest,
and enjoin what thou wilt. he confesses to have received, and when he
glorieth, in the [[lord]] he glorieth. another have i heard begging that he
might receive. take from me (saith he) the desires [[desire]] of the belly; whence
it appeareth, o my holy [[god]], that thou givest, when that is done which
thou commandest to be done.

thou hast taught me, [[good]] [[father]], that to the pure, all things are pure;
but that it is [[evil]] unto the [[man]] that eateth with offence; and, that
every creature of thine is [[good]], and nothing to be refused, which is
received with thanksgiving; and that meat commendeth us not to [[god]]; and,
that no [[man]] should [[judge]] us in meat or drink; and, that he which eateth,
let him not despise him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth
not, [[judge]] him that eateth. these things have i learned, thanks be
to thee, [[praise]] to thee, my [[god]], my master, knocking at my ears,
enlightening my [[heart]]; deliver me out of all temptation. i [[fear]] not
uncleanness of meat, but the uncleanness of lusting. i [[know]]; that noah
was permitted to [[eat]] all [[kind]] of flesh that was [[good]] for food; that
elijah was fed with flesh; that endued with an admirable abstinence, was
not polluted by feeding on living creatures, locusts. i [[know]] also that
esau was deceived by lusting for lentiles; and that [[david]] blamed himself
for desiring a draught of water; and that our [[king]] was tempted, not
concerning flesh, but bread. and therefore the [[people]] in the wilderness
also deserved to be reproved, not for desiring flesh, but because, in
the [[desire]] of food, they murmured against the [[lord]].

placed then amid these temptations, i strive daily against concupiscence
in eating and drinking. for it is not of such [[nature]] that i can settle
on cutting it off once for all, and never touching it afterward, as
i could of concubinage. the bridle of the throat then is to be held
attempered between slackness and stiffness. and who is he, o [[lord]], who
is not some whit transported beyond the limits of necessity? whoever he
is, he is a [[great]] one; let him make thy name [[great]]. but i am not such,
for i am a sinful [[man]]. yet do i too magnify thy name; and he maketh
intercession to thee for my sins [[sin]] who hath overcome the [[world]]; numbering
me among the [[weak]] members of his [[body]]; because thine [[eyes]] have seen that
of him which is imperfect, and in thy [[book]] shall all be written.

with the allurements of smells, i am not much concerned. when absent, i
do not miss them; when [[present]], i do not refuse them; yet ever ready to
be without them. so i seem to myself; perchance i am deceived. for that
also is a mournful darkness whereby my abilities within me are hidden
from me; so that my [[mind]] making enquiry into herself of her own powers [[power]],
ventures not readily to [[believe]] herself; because even what is in it
is mostly hidden, unless [[experience]] reveal it. and no one ought to be
secure in that [[life]], the whole whereof is called a [[trial]], that he who
hath been capable of worse to be made [[better]], may not likewise of better
be made worse. our only [[hope]], only confidence, only assured promise is
thy [[mercy]].

the delights of the ear had more firmly entangled and subdued me; but
thou didst loosen and [[free]] me. now, in those melodies which thy words
breathe [[soul]] into, when sung with a sweet and attuned voice, i do
a little repose; yet not so as to be held thereby, but that i can
disengage myself when i will. but with the words which are their
life and whereby they find admission into me, themselves seek in my
affections a place of some estimation, and i can scarcely assign them
one suitable. for at one [[time]] i seem to myself to give them more honour
than is seemly, feeling our minds [[mind]] to be more holily and fervently raised
unto a flame of devotion, by the holy words themselves when thus sung,
than when not; and that the several affections of our spirit, by a sweet
variety, have their own proper measures in the voice and singing, by
some hidden correspondence wherewith they are stirred up. but this
contentment of the flesh, to which the [[soul]] must not be given over to be
enervated, doth oft beguile me, the sense not so waiting upon [[reason]] as
patiently to [[follow]] her; but having been admitted merely for her sake,
it strives even to run before her, and lead her. thus in these things i
unawares [[sin]], but afterwards am aware of it.

at other times [[time]], shunning over-anxiously this very deception, i err in
too [[great]] strictness; and sometimes to that [[degree]], as to [[wish]] the whole
melody of sweet [[music]] which is used to david's psalter, [[banished]] from
my ears, and the church's too; and that mode seems to me safer, which i
remember to have been often told me of athanasius, bishop of alexandria,
who made the reader of the psalm utter it with so slight inflection
of voice, that it was nearer speaking than singing. yet again, when
i [[remember]] the tears i shed at the psalmody of thy [[church]], in the
beginning of my recovered [[faith]]; and how at this [[time]] i am moved, not
with the singing, but with the things sung, when they are sung with a
clear voice and modulation most suitable, i acknowledge the [[great]] use
of this institution. thus i fluctuate between peril of [[pleasure]] and
approved wholesomeness; inclined the rather (though not as pronouncing
an irrevocable opinion) to approve of the usage of singing in the
church; that so by the delight of the ears the weaker minds [[mind]] may rise to
the feeling of devotion. yet when it befalls me to be more moved with
the voice than the words sung, i confess to have sinned penally, and
then had rather not hear [[music]]. see now my [[state]]; weep with me, and weep
for me, ye, whoso regulate your feelings within, as that [[good]] action
ensues. for you who do not act, these things touch not you. but thou, o
lord my [[god]], hearken; behold, and see, and have [[mercy]] and heal me, thou,
in whose presence i have become a problem to myself; and that is my
infirmity.

there remains the [[pleasure]] of these [[eyes]] of my flesh, on which to make
my confessions in the hearing of the ears of thy temple, those brotherly
and devout ears; and so to conclude the temptations of the [[lust]] of
the flesh, which yet assail me, groaning earnestly, and desiring to be
clothed upon with my house from [[heaven]]. the [[eyes]] [[love]] [[fair]] and varied
forms, and bright and soft colours. let not these occupy my [[soul]]; let
god rather occupy it, who made these things, very [[good]] indeed, yet is
he my [[good]], not they. and these affect me, waking, the whole day, nor
is any rest given me from them, as there is from musical, sometimes in
silence, from all voices. for this queen of colours, the [[light]], bathing
all which we behold, wherever i am through the day, gliding by me in
varied forms, soothes me when engaged on other things, and not observing
it. and so strongly doth it entwine itself, that if it be suddenly
withdrawn, it is with longing sought for, and if absent long, saddeneth
the [[mind]].

o thou [[light]], which tobias saw, when, these [[eyes]] closed, he taught his
son the way of [[life]]; and himself went before with the feet of charity,
never swerving. or which isaac saw, when his fleshly [[eyes]] being heavy
and closed by old [[age]], it was vouchsafed him, not knowingly, to bless
his sons [[son]], but by blessing to [[know]] them. or which jacob saw, when he
also, blind through [[great]] [[age]], with illumined [[heart]], in the persons [[person]] of
his sons [[son]] shed [[light]] on the different races [[race]] of the future [[people]], in
them foresignified; and laid his hands, mystically crossed, upon
his grandchildren by joseph, not as their [[father]] by his outward eye
corrected them, but as himself inwardly discerned. this is the [[light]], it
is one, and all are one, who see and [[love]] it. but that corporeal light
whereof i spake, it seasoneth the [[life]] of this [[world]] for her blind
lovers, with an enticing and dangerous sweetness. but they who [[know]] how
to [[praise]] thee for it, "o all-creating [[lord]]," take it up in thy hymns,
and are not taken up with it in their sleep. such would i be. these
seductions of the [[eyes]] i resist, lest my feet wherewith i walk upon thy
way be ensnared; and i lift up mine invisible [[eyes]] to thee, that thou
wouldest pluck my feet out of the snare. thou dost ever and anon pluck
them out, for they are ensnared. thou ceasest not to pluck them out,
while i often entangle myself in the snares on all sides laid; because
thou that keepest [[israel]] shalt neither slumber nor sleep.

what innumerable toys, made by divers [[arts]] and manufactures, in our
apparel, shoes, utensils and all sorts of works [[work]], in pictures also and
divers images, and these far exceeding all necessary and moderate use
and all pious meaning, have [[men]] added to tempt their own [[eyes]] withal;
outwardly following what themselves make, inwardly forsaking him by whom
themselves were made, and destroying that which themselves have been
made! but i, my [[god]] and my [[glory]], do hence also sing a hymn to thee, and
do consecrate [[praise]] to him who consecrateth me, because those beautiful
patterns which through men's souls [[soul]] are conveyed into their cunning
hands, come from that [[beauty]], which is above our souls [[soul]], which my soul
day and night sigheth after. but the framers and followers of the
outward beauties [[beauty]] derive thence the [[rule]] of judging of them, but not of
using them. and he is there, though they perceive him not, that so they
might not wander, but keep their [[strength]] for thee, and not scatter it
abroad upon pleasurable weariness. and i, though i speak and see this,
entangle my steps with these outward beauties [[beauty]]; but thou pluckest me out,
o [[lord]], thou pluckest me out; because thy loving-kindness is before my
eyes. for i am taken miserably, and thou pluckest me out mercifully;
sometimes not perceiving it, when i had but lightly lighted upon them;
otherwhiles with [[pain]], because i had stuck fast in them.

to this is added another form of temptation more manifoldly dangerous.
for besides that concupiscence of the flesh which consisteth in the
delight of all senses and pleasures [[pleasure]], wherein its slaves [[slave]], who go far from
thee, waste and perish, the [[soul]] hath, through the same senses of the
body, a [[certain]] [[vain]] and [[curious]] [[desire]], veiled under the title of
knowledge and learning, not of delighting in the flesh, but of making
experiments through the flesh. the seat whereof being in the appetite
of [[knowledge]], and sight being the sense chiefly used for attaining
knowledge, it is in [[divine]] [[language]] called the [[lust]] of the [[eyes]]. for, to
see, belongeth properly to the [[eyes]]; yet we use this word of the other
senses also, when we employ them in seeking [[knowledge]]. for we do not
say, hark how it flashes, or smell how it glows, or taste how it shines,
or [[feel]] how it gleams; for all these are said to be seen. and yet we
say not only, see how it shineth, which the [[eyes]] alone can perceive; but
also, see how it soundeth, see how it smelleth, see how it tasteth,
see how hard it is. and so the general [[experience]] of the senses, as
was said, is called the [[lust]] of the [[eyes]], because the office of seeing,
wherein the [[eyes]] hold the prerogative, the other senses by way
of similitude take to themselves, when they make search after any
knowledge.

but by this may more evidently be discerned, wherein [[pleasure]] and
wherein curiosity is the object of the senses; for [[pleasure]] seeketh
objects beautiful, melodious, fragrant, savoury, soft; but curiosity,
for trial's sake, the contrary as well, not for the sake of suffering
annoyance, but out of the [[lust]] of making [[trial]] and knowing them. for
what [[pleasure]] hath it, to see in a mangled carcase what will make you
shudder? and yet if it be lying near, they flock thither, to be made
sad, and to turn pale. even in sleep they are afraid to see it. as if
when awake, any one forced them to see it, or any report of its beauty
drew them thither! thus also in the other senses, which it were long to
go through. from this disease of curiosity are all those [[strange]] sights
exhibited in the theatre. hence [[men]] go on to search out the hidden
powers of [[nature]] (which is besides our end), which to [[know]] profits [[profit]] not,
and wherein [[men]] [[desire]] nothing but to [[know]]. hence also, if with that
same end of perverted [[knowledge]] magical [[arts]] be enquired by. hence also
in [[religion]] itself, is [[god]] tempted, when signs and wonders are demanded
of him, not [[desired]] for any [[good]] end, but merely to make [[trial]] of.

in this so vast wilderness, full of snares and dangers, behold many of
them i have cut off, and thrust out of my [[heart]], as thou hast given me,
o [[god]] of my salvation. and yet when dare i say, since so many things of
this [[kind]] buzz on all sides about our daily life-when dare i say that
nothing of this sort engages my attention, or causes in me an idle
interest? true, the theatres do not now carry me away, nor [[care]] i to
know the courses of the stars, nor did my [[soul]] ever consult ghosts
departed; all sacrilegious mysteries i detest. from thee, o [[lord]] my [[god]],
to whom i owe humble and single-hearted service, by what artifices
and suggestions doth the [[enemy]] deal with me to [[desire]] some sign! but i
beseech thee by our [[king]], and by our pure and holy [[country]], [[jerusalem]],
that as any consenting thereto is far from me, so may it ever be further
and further. but when i [[pray]] thee for the salvation of any, my end and
intention is far different. thou givest and wilt give me to [[follow]] thee
willingly, doing what thou wilt.

notwithstanding, in how many most petty and contemptible things is our
curiosity daily tempted, and how often we give way, who can recount? how
often do we begin as if we were tolerating [[people]] telling [[vain]] stories,
lest we offend the [[weak]]; then by degrees [[degree]] we take interest therein! i go
not now to the circus to see a dog coursing a hare; but in the field,
if passing, that coursing peradventure will distract me even from some
weighty [[thought]], and draw me after it: not that i turn aside the body
of my beast, yet still incline my [[mind]] thither. and unless thou, having
made me see my infirmity didst speedily admonish me either through the
sight itself by some contemplation to rise towards thee, or altogether
to despise and pass it by, i dully stand fixed therein. what, when
sitting at [[home]], a lizard catching flies, or a spider entangling them
rushing into her nets, oft-times takes my attention? is the thing
different, because they are but small creatures? i go on from them to
praise thee the wonderful creator and orderer of all, but this does not
first draw my attention. it is one thing to rise quickly, another not
to fall. and of such things is my [[life]] full; and my one [[hope]] is thy
wonderful [[great]] [[mercy]]. for when our [[heart]] becomes the receptacle of such
things, and is overcharged with throngs of this abundant vanity, then
are our prayers also thereby often interrupted and distracted, and
whilst in thy presence we direct the voice of our [[heart]] to thine ears,
this so [[great]] concern is broken off by the rushing in of i [[know]] not what
idle thoughts [[thought]]. shall we then account this also among things of slight
concernment, or shall aught bring us back to [[hope]], save thy complete
mercy, since thou hast begun to [[change]] us?

and thou knowest how far thou hast already changed me, who first
healedst me of the [[lust]] of vindicating myself, that so thou mightest
forgive all the rest of my iniquities, and heal all my infirmities,
and redeem [[life]] from [[corruption]], and [[crown]] me with [[mercy]] and [[pity]], and
satisfy my [[desire]] with [[good]] things: who didst curb my [[pride]] with thy
fear, and tame my neck to thy yoke. and now i bear it and it is light
unto me, because so hast thou promised, and hast made it; and verily so
it was, and i knew it not, when i feared to take it.

but, o [[lord]], thou alone [[lord]] without [[pride]], because thou art [[arts]] the only
true [[lord]], who hast no [[lord]]; hath this third [[kind]] of temptation also
ceased from me, or can it cease through this whole [[life]]? to [[wish]],
namely, to be feared and loved of [[men]], for no other end, but that we
may have a joy therein which is no joy? a miserable [[life]] this and a foul
boastfulness! hence especially it comes that [[men]] do neither purely love
nor [[fear]] thee. and therefore dost thou resist the proud, and givest
grace to the humble: yea, thou thunderest down upon the ambitions of the
world, and the foundations of the mountains tremble. because now certain
offices of [[human]] [[society]] make it necessary to be loved and feared of
men, the adversary of our true blessedness layeth hard at us, every
where spreading his snares of "well-done, well-done"; that greedily
catching at them, we may be taken unawares, and sever our joy from thy
truth, and set it in the deceivingness of [[men]]; and be pleased at being
loved and feared, not for thy sake, but in thy stead: and thus having
been made like him, he may have them for his own, not in the bands of
charity, but in the bonds of [[punishment]]: who purposed to set his throne
in the north, that dark and chilled they might serve him, pervertedly
and crookedly imitating thee. but we, o [[lord]], behold we are thy little
flock; possess us as thine, stretch thy wings over us, and let us fly
under them. be thou our [[glory]]; let us be loved for thee, and thy word
feared in us. who would be praised of [[men]] when thou blamest, will not be
defended of [[men]] when thou judgest; nor delivered when thou condemnest.
but when--not the sinner is praised in the desires [[desire]] of his [[soul]], nor he
blessed who doth ungodlily, but--a [[man]] is praised for some gift which
thou hast given him, and he rejoices more at the [[praise]] for himself than
that he hath the gift for which he is praised, he also is praised, while
thou dispraisest; [[better]] is he who praised than he who is praised. for
the one took [[pleasure]] in the gift of [[god]] in [[man]]; the other was better
pleased with the gift of [[man]], than of [[god]].

by these temptations we are assailed daily, o [[lord]]; without ceasing are
we assailed. our daily furnace is the tongue of [[men]]. and in this way
also thou commandest us continence. give what thou enjoinest, and enjoin
what thou wilt. thou knowest on this matter the groans of my [[heart]], and
the floods of mine [[eyes]]. for i cannot learn how far i am more cleansed
from this plague, and i much [[fear]] my secret sins [[sin]], which thine [[eyes]] [[know]],
mine do not. for in other kinds [[kind]] of temptations i have some sort of means
of examining myself; in this, scarce any. for, in refraining my mind
from the pleasures [[pleasure]] of the flesh and idle curiosity, i see how much i
have attained lo, when i do without them; foregoing, or not having them.
for then i ask myself how much more or less troublesome it is to me not
to have them? then, riches [[rich]], which are [[desired]], that they may serve to
some one or two or all of the three concupiscences, if the [[soul]] cannot
discern whether, when it hath them, it despiseth them, they may be
cast aside, that so it may prove itself. but to be without [[praise]],
and therein essay our powers [[power]], must we [[live]] ill, yea so abandonedly and
atrociously, that no one should [[know]] without detesting us? what greater
madness can be said or [[thought]] of? but if [[praise]] useth and ought to
accompany a [[good]] [[life]] and [[good]] works [[work]], we ought as little to forego its
company, as [[good]] [[life]] itself. yet i [[know]] not whether i can well or ill
be without anything, unless it be absent.

what then do i confess unto thee in this [[kind]] of temptation, o [[lord]]?
what, but that i am delighted with [[praise]], but with [[truth]] itself, more
than with [[praise]]? for were it proposed to me, whether i would, being
frenzied in error on all things, be praised by all [[men]], or being
consistent and most settled in the [[truth]] be blamed by all, i see which
i should choose. yet fain would i that the approbation of another should
not even increase my joy for any [[good]] in me. yet i own, it doth increase
it, and not so only, but dispraise doth diminish it. and when i am
troubled at this my misery, an excuse occurs to me, which of what value
it is, thou [[god]] knowest, for it leaves me uncertain. for since thou hast
commanded us not continency alone, that is, from what things to refrain
our [[love]], but [[righteousness]] also, that is, whereon to bestow it, and
hast willed us to [[love]] not thee only, but our neighbour also; often,
when pleased with [[intelligent]] [[praise]], i seem to myself to be pleased
with the proficiency or towardliness of my neighbour, or to be grieved
for [[evil]] in him, when i hear him dispraise either what he understands
not, or is [[good]]. for sometimes i am [[grieved]] at my own [[praise]], either
when those things be praised in me, in which i mislike myself, or even
lesser and slight goods [[good]] are more esteemed than they ought. but again how
know i whether i am therefore thus affected, because i would not have
him who praiseth me differ from me about myself; not as being influenced
by concern for him, but because those same [[good]] things which please me
in myself, please me more when they please another also? for some how i
am not praised when my [[judgment]] of myself is not praised; forasmuch
as either those things are praised, which displease me; or those more,
which please me less. am i then doubtful of myself in this matter?

behold, in thee, o [[truth]], i see that i ought not to be moved at my own
praises, for my own sake, but for the [[good]] of my neighbour. and whether
it be so with me, i [[know]] not. for herein i [[know]] less of myself than of
thee. i beseech now, o my [[god]], discover to me myself also, that i may
confess unto my brethren [[brother]], who are to [[pray]] for me, wherein i find myself
maimed. let me examine myself again more diligently. if in my [[praise]] i
am moved with the [[good]] of my neighbour, why am i less moved if another
be unjustly dispraised than if it be myself? why am i more stung by
reproach cast upon myself, than at that cast upon another, with the
same [[injustice]], before me? [[know]] i not this also? or is it at [[last]] that i
deceive myself, and do not the [[truth]] before thee in my [[heart]] and tongue?
this madness put far from me, o [[lord]], lest mine own mouth be to me the
sinner's [[oil]] to make fat my head. i am [[poor]] and needy; yet [[best]], while
in hidden groanings i displease myself, and seek thy [[mercy]], until what
is lacking in my defective [[state]] be renewed and perfected, on to that
peace which the eye of the proud knoweth not.

yet the word which cometh out of the mouth, and deeds known to [[men]],
bring with them a most dangerous temptation through the [[love]] of [[praise]]:
which, to establish a [[certain]] excellency of our own, solicits and
collects men's suffrages. it tempts, even when it is reproved by myself
in myself, on the very ground that it is reproved; and often glories
more vainly of the very contempt of vain-glory; and so it is no longer
contempt of vain-glory, whereof it glories; for it doth not contemn when
it glorieth.

within also, within is another [[evil]], arising out of a like temptation;
whereby [[men]] become [[vain]], pleasing themselves in themselves, though they
please not, or displease or [[care]] not to please others. but pleasing
themselves, they much displease thee, not only taking [[pleasure]] in things
not [[good]], as if [[good]], but in thy [[good]] things, as though their own; or
even if as thine, yet as though for their own merits [[merit]]; or even if as
though from thy grace, yet not with brotherly rejoicing, but envying
that grace to others. in all these and the like perils and travails,
thou seest the trembling of my [[heart]]; and i rather [[feel]] my wounds to be
cured by thee, than not inflicted by me.

where hast thou not walked with me, o [[truth]], teaching me what to beware,
and what to [[desire]]; when i referred to thee what i could discover
here below, and consulted thee? with my outward senses, as i might, i
surveyed the [[world]], and observed the [[life]], which my [[body]] hath from me,
and these my senses. thence entered i the recesses of my memory, those
manifold and spacious chambers, wonderfully furnished with innumerable
stores; and i considered, and stood aghast; being able to discern
nothing of these things without thee, and finding none of them to be
thee. nor was i myself, who found out these things, who went over them
all, and laboured to distinguish and to value every thing according
to its [[dignity]], taking some things upon the report of my senses,
questioning about others which i [[felt]] to be mingled with myself,
numbering and distinguishing the reporters themselves, and in the large
treasure-house of my memory revolving some things, storing up others,
drawing out others. nor yet was i myself when i did this, i.e., that my
power whereby i did it, neither was it thou, for thou art [[arts]] the abiding
light, which i consulted concerning all these, whether they were,
what they were, and how to be valued; and i heard thee directing and
commanding me; and this i often do, this delights me, and as far as i
may be freed from necessary duties [[duty]], unto this [[pleasure]] have i recourse.
nor in all these which i run over consulting thee can i find any safe
place for my [[soul]], but in thee; whither my scattered members may
be gathered, and nothing of me depart from thee. and sometimes thou
admittest me to an affection, very unusual, in my inmost [[soul]]; rising to
a [[strange]] sweetness, which if it were perfected in me, i [[know]] not what
in it would not belong to the [[life]] to come. but through my miserable
encumbrances i sink down again into these lower things, and am swept
back by former custom, and am held, and greatly weep, but am greatly
held. so much doth the burden of a [[bad]] custom weigh us down. here i can
stay, but would not; there i would, but cannot; both ways, miserable.

thus then have i considered the sicknesses of my sins [[sin]] in that threefold
concupiscence, and have called thy [[right]] hand to my [[help]]. for with a
wounded [[heart]] have i beheld thy brightness, and stricken back i said,
"who can attain thither? i am cast away from the sight of thine [[eyes]]."
thou art [[arts]] the [[truth]] who presidest over all, but i through my covetousness
would not indeed forego thee, but would with thee possess a [[lie]]; as no
man would in such [[wise]] speak falsely, as himself to be ignorant of the
truth. so then i lost thee, because thou vouchsafest not to be possessed
with a [[lie]].

whom could i find to reconcile me to thee? was i to have recourse to
angels? by what prayers? by what sacraments? many endeavouring to return
unto thee, and of themselves unable, have, as i hear, tried this, and
fallen into the [[desire]] of [[curious]] visions, and been accounted worthy
to be deluded. for they, being high minded, sought thee by the [[pride]] of
learning, swelling out rather than smiting upon their breasts, and so
by the agreement of their [[heart]], drew unto themselves the princes [[prince]] of the
air, the fellow-conspirators of their [[pride]], by whom, through magical
influences, they were deceived, seeking a mediator, by whom they might
be purged, and there was none. for the [[devil]] it was, transforming
himself into an angel of [[light]]. and it much enticed proud flesh, that he
had no [[body]] of flesh. for they were mortal, and sinners; but thou, [[lord]],
to whom they proudly sought to be reconciled, art [[arts]] [[immortal]], and without
sin. but a mediator between [[god]] and [[man]] must have something like to [[god]],
something like to [[men]]; lest being in both like to [[man]], he should be
far from [[god]]: or if in both like [[god]], too unlike [[man]]: and so not be a
mediator. that deceitful mediator then, by whom in thy secret judgments
pride deserved to be deluded, hath one thing in [[common]] with [[man]], that
is [[sin]]; another he would seem to have in [[common]] with [[god]]; and not being
clothed with the [[mortality]] of flesh, would vaunt himself to be [[immortal]].
but since the wages of [[sin]] is [[death]], this hath he in [[common]] with [[men]],
that with them he should be condemned to [[death]].

but the true mediator, whom in thy secret [[mercy]] thou hast showed to the
humble, and sentest, that by his [[example]] also they might learn that
same [[humility]], that mediator between [[god]] and [[man]], the [[man]] [[christ]] [[jesus]],
appeared betwixt mortal sinners and the [[immortal]] just one; mortal with
men, just with [[god]]: that because the wages of [[righteousness]] is [[life]] and
peace, he might by a [[righteousness]] conjoined with [[god]] make void that
death of sinners, now made righteous, which he willed to have in common
with them. hence he was showed forth to holy [[men]] of old; that so they,
through [[faith]] in his passion to come, as we through [[faith]] of it passed,
might be saved. for as [[man]], he was a mediator; but as the word, not in
the middle between [[god]] and [[man]], because [[equal]] to [[god]], and [[god]] with [[god]],
and together one [[god]].

how hast thou loved us, [[good]] [[father]], who sparedst not thine only [[son]],
but deliveredst him up for us ungodly! how hast thou loved us, for whom
he that [[thought]] it no robbery to be [[equal]] with thee, was made subject
even to the [[death]] of the cross, he alone, [[free]] among the [[dead]], having
power to lay down his [[life]], and [[power]] to take it again: for us to thee
both victor and victim, and therefore victor, because the victim; for
us to thee [[priest]] and [[sacrifice]], and therefore [[priest]] because the
sacrifice; making us to thee, of servants, sons [[son]] by being born of thee,
and serving us. well then is my [[hope]] [[strong]] in him, that thou wilt heal
all my infirmities, by him who sitteth at thy [[right]] hand and maketh
intercession for us; else should i despair. for many and [[great]] are my
infirmities, many they are, and [[great]]; but thy medicine is mightier. we
might imagine that thy word was far from any union with [[man]], and despair
of ourselves, unless he had been made flesh and dwelt among us.

affrighted with my sins [[sin]] and the burden of my misery, i had cast in my
heart, and had purposed to flee to the wilderness: but thou forbadest
me, and strengthenedst me, saying, therefore [[christ]] died for all, that
they which [[live]] may now no longer [[live]] unto themselves, but unto him
that died for them. see, [[lord]], i cast my [[care]] upon thee, that i may
live, and consider wondrous things out of thy [[law]]. thou knowest my
unskilfulness, and my infirmities; [[teach]] me, and heal me. he, thine only
son, in whom are hid all the treasures of [[wisdom]] and [[knowledge]], hath
redeemed me with his [[blood]]. let not the proud speak [[evil]] of me; because
i meditate on my ransom, and [[eat]] and drink, and communicate it; and
poor, [[desired]] to be satisfied from him, amongst those that [[eat]] and are
satisfied, and they shall [[praise]] the [[lord]] who seek him.




book xi


lord, since eternity is thine, art [[arts]] thou ignorant of what i say to thee?
or dost thou see in [[time]], what passeth in [[time]]? why then do i lay in
order before thee so many relations? not, of a [[truth]], that thou mightest
learn them through me, but to stir up mine own and my readers' devotions
towards thee, that we may all say, [[great]] is the [[lord]], and greatly to be
praised. i have said already; and again will say, for [[love]] of thy
love do i this. for we [[pray]] also, and yet [[truth]] hath said, your father
knoweth what you have need of, before you ask. it is then our affections
which we lay open unto thee, confessing our own miseries, and thy
mercies upon us, that thou mayest [[free]] us wholly, since thou hast begun,
that we may cease to be wretched in ourselves, and be blessed in thee;
seeing thou hast called us, to become [[poor]] in spirit, and meek, and
mourners, and hungering and athirst after [[righteousness]], and merciful,
and pure in [[heart]], and peace-makers. see, i have told thee many things,
as i could and as i would, because thou first wouldest that i should
confess unto thee, my [[lord]] [[god]]. for thou art [[arts]] [[good]], for thy mercy
endureth for ever.

but how shall i suffice with the tongue of my pen to utter all thy
exhortations, and all thy terrors, and comforts, and guidances, whereby
thou broughtest me to preach thy word, and dispense thy sacrament to thy
people? and if i suffice to utter them in order, the drops of [[time]] are
precious with me; and long have i burned to meditate in thy [[law]], and
therein to confess to thee my [[skill]] and unskilfulness, the daybreak of
thy enlightening, and the remnants of my darkness, until infirmity be
swallowed up by [[strength]]. and i would not have aught besides steal away
those hours which i find [[free]] from the necessities of refreshing my body
and the powers [[power]] of my [[mind]], and of the service which we owe to [[men]], or
which though we owe not, we yet [[pay]].

o [[lord]] my [[god]], give ear unto my prayer, and let thy [[mercy]] hearken unto
my [[desire]]: because it is anxious not for myself alone, but would serve
brotherly charity; and thou seest my [[heart]], that so it is. i would
sacrifice to thee the service of my [[thought]] and tongue; do thou give me,
what i may offer thee. for i am [[poor]] and needy, thou [[rich]] to all that
call upon thee; who, inaccessible to [[care]], carest for us. circumcise
from all rashness and all lying both my inward and outward lips: let
thy scriptures [[scripture]] be my pure delights: let me not be deceived in them, nor
deceive out of them. [[lord]], hearken and [[pity]], o [[lord]] my [[god]], [[light]] of the
blind, and [[strength]] of the [[weak]]; yea also [[light]] of those that see, and
strength of the [[strong]]; hearken unto my [[soul]], and hear it crying out of
the depths. for if thine ears be not with us in the depths also, whither
shall we go? whither cry? the day is thine, and the night is thine; at
thy beck the moments flee by. grant thereof a space for our meditations
in the hidden things of thy [[law]], and close it not against us who knock.
for not in [[vain]] wouldest thou have the darksome secrets of so many pages
written; nor are those forests without their harts which retire therein
and range and walk; feed, [[lie]] down, and ruminate. [[perfect]] me, o
lord, and reveal them unto me. behold, thy voice is my joy; thy voice
exceedeth the abundance of pleasures [[pleasure]]. give what i [[love]]: for i do [[love]];
and this hast thou given: forsake not thy own gifts, nor despise thy
green herb that thirsteth. let me confess unto thee whatsoever i shall
find in thy books [[book]], and hear the voice of [[praise]], and drink in thee,
and meditate on the wonderful things out of thy [[law]]; even from the
beginning, wherein thou madest the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]], unto the
everlasting reigning of thy holy [[city]] with thee.

lord, have [[mercy]] on me, and hear my [[desire]]. for it is not, i deem, of
the [[earth]], not of gold and silver, and precious stones, or gorgeous
apparel, or honours [[honour]] and offices, or the pleasures [[pleasure]] of the flesh, or
necessaries for the [[body]] and for this [[life]] of our pilgrimage: all which
shall be added unto those that seek thy [[kingdom]] and thy [[righteousness]].
behold, o [[lord]] my [[god]], wherein is my [[desire]]. the wicked have told me of
delights, but not such as thy [[law]], o [[lord]]. behold, wherein is my [[desire]].
behold, [[father]], behold, and see and approve; and be it pleasing in the
sight of thy [[mercy]], that i may find grace before thee, that the inward
parts of thy words be opened to me knocking. i beseech by our [[lord]] jesus
christ thy [[son]], the [[man]] of thy [[right]] hand, the [[son]] of [[man]], whom thou
hast established for thyself, as thy mediator and ours, through whom
thou soughtest us, not seeking thee, but soughtest us, that we might
seek thee,--thy word, through whom thou madest all things, and among
them, me also;--thy only-begotten, through whom thou calledst to
adoption the believing [[people]], and therein me also;--i beseech thee by
him, who sitteth at thy [[right]] hand, and intercedeth with thee for us,
in whom are hidden all the treasures of [[wisdom]] and [[knowledge]]. these do
i seek in thy books [[book]]. of him did [[moses]] write; this saith himself; this
saith the [[truth]].

i would hear and [[understand]], how "in the beginning thou madest the
heaven and [[earth]]." [[moses]] wrote this, wrote and departed, passed hence
from thee to thee; nor is he now before me. for if he were, i would hold
him and ask him, and beseech him by thee to open these things unto me,
and would lay the ears of my [[body]] to the sounds bursting out of his
mouth. and should he speak [[hebrew]], in [[vain]] will it strike on my senses,
nor would aught of it touch my [[mind]]; but if latin, i should [[know]] what
he said. but whence should i [[know]], whether he spake [[truth]]? yea, and if
i knew this also, should i [[know]] it from him? truly within me, within, in
the chamber of my thoughts [[thought]], [[truth]], neither [[hebrew]], nor [[greek]], nor latin,
nor barbarian, without organs of voice or tongue, or sound of syllables,
would say, "it is [[truth]]," and i forthwith should say confidently to that
man of thine, "thou sayest truly." whereas then i cannot enquire of him,
thee, thee i beseech, o [[truth]], full of whom he spake [[truth]], thee, my
god, i beseech, [[forgive]] my sins [[sin]]; and thou, who gavest him thy servant to
speak these things, give to me also to [[understand]] them.

behold, the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]] are; they proclaim that they were
created; for they [[change]] and vary. whereas whatsoever hath not been
made, and yet is, hath nothing in it, which before it had not; and
this it is, to [[change]] and vary. they proclaim also, that they made not
themselves; "therefore we are, because we have been made; we were not
therefore, before we were, so as to make ourselves." now the evidence
of the thing, is the voice of the speakers. thou therefore, [[lord]], madest
them; who art [[arts]] beautiful, for they are beautiful; who art [[arts]] [[good]], for they
are [[good]]; who art [[arts]], for they are; yet are they not beautiful nor [[good]],
nor are they, as thou their creator art [[arts]]; compared with whom, they are
neither beautiful, nor [[good]], nor are. this we [[know]], thanks be to thee.
and our [[knowledge]], compared with thy [[knowledge]], is ignorance.

but how didst thou make the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]? and what the engine of
thy so mighty fabric? for it was not as a [[human]] artificer, forming one
body from another, according to the discretion of his [[mind]], which can
in some way invest with such a form, as it seeth in itself by its inward
eye. and whence should he be able to do this, unless thou hadst made
that [[mind]]? and he invests with a form what already existeth, and hath
a being, as clay, or stone, or wood, or gold, or the like. and whence
should they be, hadst not thou appointed them? thou madest the artificer
his [[body]], thou the [[mind]] commanding the limbs, thou the matter whereof he
makes any thing; thou the apprehension whereby to take in his art [[arts]], and
see within what he doth without; thou the sense of his [[body]], whereby,
as by an interpreter, he may from [[mind]] to matter, convey that which he
doth, and report to his [[mind]] what is done; that it within may consult
the [[truth]], which presideth over itself, whether it be well done or no.
all these [[praise]] thee, the creator of all. but how dost thou make them?
how, o [[god]], didst thou make [[heaven]] and [[earth]]? verily, neither in the
heaven, nor in the [[earth]], didst thou make [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; nor in the
air, or waters, seeing these also belong to the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]];
nor in the whole [[world]] didst thou make the whole [[world]]; because there
was no place where to make it, before it was made, that it might be. nor
didst thou hold any thing in thy hand, whereof to make [[heaven]] and [[earth]].
for whence shouldest thou have this, which thou hadst not made, thereof
to make any thing? for what is, but because thou art [[arts]]? therefore thou
spokest, and they were made, and in thy word thou madest them.

but how didst thou speak? in the way that the voice came out of the
cloud, saying, this is my beloved [[son]]? for that voice passed by and
passed away, began and ended; the syllables sounded and passed away,
the second after the first, the third after the second, and so forth in
order, until the [[last]] after the rest, and [[silence]] after the [[last]]. whence
it is abundantly clear and plain that the motion of a creature expressed
it, itself temporal, serving thy eternal will. and these thy words,
created for a [[time]], the outward ear reported to the [[intelligent]] [[soul]],
whose inward ear lay listening to thy eternal word. but she compared
these words sounding in [[time]], with that thy eternal word in [[silence]], and
said "it is different, far different. these words are far beneath me,
nor are they, because they flee and pass away; but the word of my lord
abideth above me for ever." if then in sounding and passing words thou
saidst that [[heaven]] and [[earth]] should be made, and so madest [[heaven]] and
earth, there was a corporeal creature before [[heaven]] and [[earth]], by whose
motions in [[time]] that voice might take his course in [[time]]. but there was
nought corporeal before [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; or if there were, surely thou
hadst, without such a passing voice, created that, whereof to make this
passing voice, by which to say, let the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]] be made.
for whatsoever that were, whereof such a voice were made, unless by
thee it were made, it could not be at all. by what word then didst thou
speak, that a [[body]] might be made, whereby these words again might be
made?

thou callest us then to [[understand]] the word, [[god]], with thee [[god]], which
is spoken eternally, and by it are all things spoken eternally. for what
was spoken was not spoken successively, one thing concluded that the
next might be spoken, but all things together and eternally. else have
we [[time]] and [[change]]; and not a true eternity nor true immortality. this i
know, o my [[god]], and give thanks. i [[know]], i confess to thee, o [[lord]], and
with me there knows [[know]] and blesses thee, whoso is not unthankful to assure
truth. we [[know]], [[lord]], we [[know]]; since inasmuch as anything is not which
was, and is, which was not, so far forth it dieth and ariseth. nothing
then of thy word doth give place or replace, because it is truly
immortal and eternal. and therefore unto the word coeternal with thee
thou dost at once and eternally say all that thou dost say; and whatever
thou sayest shall be made is made; nor dost thou make, otherwise than by
saying; and yet are not all things made together, or everlasting, which
thou makest by saying.

why, i beseech thee, o [[lord]] my [[god]]? i see it in a way; but how to
express it, i [[know]] not, unless it be, that whatsoever begins to be, and
leaves off to be, begins then, and leaves off then, when in thy eternal
reason it is known, that it ought to begin or leave off; in which reason
nothing beginneth or leaveth off. this is thy word, which is also "the
beginning, because also it speaketh unto us." thus in the gospel he
speaketh through the flesh; and this sounded outwardly in the ears of
men; that it might be believed and sought inwardly, and found in
the eternal verity; where the [[good]] and only master teacheth all his
disciples. there, [[lord]], hear i thy voice speaking unto me; because he
speaketh us, who teacheth us; but he that teacheth us not, though
he speaketh, to us he speaketh not. who now teacheth us, but the
unchangeable [[truth]]? for even when we are admonished through a changeable
creature; we are but [[led]] to the unchangeable [[truth]]; where we learn
truly, while we stand and hear him, and rejoice greatly because of the
bridegroom's voice, restoring us to him, from whom we are. and therefore
the beginning, because unless it abided, there should not, when we
went astray, be whither to return. but when we return from error, it is
through knowing; and that we may [[know]], he teacheth us, because he is the
beginning, and speaking unto us.

in this beginning, o [[god]], hast thou made [[heaven]] and [[earth]], in thy
word, in thy [[son]], in thy [[power]], in thy [[wisdom]], in thy [[truth]]; wondrously
speaking, and wondrously making. who shall comprehend? who declare
it? what is that which gleams through me, and strikes my [[heart]] without
hurting it; and i shudder and kindle? i shudder, inasmuch as i am unlike
it; i kindle, inasmuch as i am like it. it is [[wisdom]], wisdom's self
which gleameth through me; severing my cloudiness which yet again
mantles over me, fainting from it, through the darkness which for my
punishment gathers upon me. for my [[strength]] is brought down in need,
so that i cannot support my blessings, till thou, [[lord]], who hast been
gracious to all mine iniquities, shalt heal all my infirmities. for
thou shalt also redeem my [[life]] from [[corruption]], and [[crown]] me with loving
kindness and tender mercies, and shalt satisfy my [[desire]] with good
things, because my [[youth]] shall be renewed like an eagle's. for in hope
we are saved, wherefore we through patience wait for thy promises. let
him that is able, hear thee inwardly discoursing out of thy oracle: i
will boldly cry out, how wonderful are thy works [[work]], o [[lord]], in wisdom
hast thou made them all; and this [[wisdom]] is the beginning, and in that
beginning didst thou make [[heaven]] and [[earth]].

lo, are they not full of their old leaven, who say to us, "what was
god doing before he made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]? for if (say they) he were
unemployed and wrought not, why does he not also henceforth, and for
ever, as he did heretofore? for did any new motion arise in [[god]], and a
new will to make a creature, which he had never before made, how then
would that be a true eternity, where there ariseth a will, which was
not? for the will of [[god]] is not a creature, but before the creature;
seeing nothing could be created, unless the will of the creator had
preceded. the will of [[god]] then belongeth to his very substance. and
if aught have arisen in god's substance, which before was not, that
substance cannot be truly called eternal. but if the will of [[god]] has
been from eternity that the creature should be, why was not the creature
also from eternity?"

who speak thus, do not yet [[understand]] thee, o [[wisdom]] of [[god]], [[light]] of
souls, [[understand]] not yet how the things be made, which by thee, and
in thee are made: yet they strive to comprehend things eternal, whilst
their [[heart]] fluttereth between the motions of things [[past]] and to come,
and is still unstable. who shall hold it, and fix it, that it be settled
awhile, and awhile catch the [[glory]] of that ever-fixed eternity, and
compare it with the times [[time]] which are never fixed, and see that it cannot
be compared; and that a long [[time]] cannot become long, but out of many
motions passing by, which cannot be prolonged altogether; but that in
the eternal nothing passeth, but the whole is [[present]]; whereas no time
is all at once [[present]]: and that all [[time]] [[past]], is driven on by [[time]] to
come, and all to come followeth upon the [[past]]; and all [[past]] and to come,
is created, and flows out of that which is ever [[present]]? who shall hold
the [[heart]] of [[man]], that it may stand still, and see how eternity ever
still-standing, neither [[past]] nor to come, uttereth the times [[time]] [[past]] and to
come? can my hand do this, or the hand of my mouth by [[speech]] bring about
a thing so [[great]]?

see, i [[answer]] him that asketh, "what did [[god]] before he made [[heaven]] and
earth?" i [[answer]] not as one is said to have done merrily (eluding the
pressure of the question), "he was preparing hell (saith he) for pryers
into mysteries." it is one thing to [[answer]] enquiries, another to make
sport of enquirers. so i [[answer]] not; for rather had i [[answer]], "i know
not," what i [[know]] not, than so as to raise a laugh at him who asketh
deep things and gain [[praise]] for one who answereth false things. but i
say that thou, our [[god]], art [[arts]] the creator of every creature: and if by
the name "heaven and [[earth]]," every creature be understood; i boldly say,
"that before [[god]] made [[heaven]] and [[earth]], he did not make any thing." for
if he made, what did he make but a creature? and would i knew whatsoever
i [[desire]] to [[know]] to my [[profit]], as i [[know]], that no creature was made,
before there was made any creature.

but if any excursive brain rove over the images of forepassed times [[time]], and
wonder that thou the [[god]] almighty and all-creating and all-supporting,
maker of [[heaven]] and [[earth]], didst for innumerable ages [[age]] forbear from so
great a [[work]], before thou wouldest make it; let him awake and consider,
that he wonders at false conceits. for whence could innumerable ages
pass by, which thou madest not, thou the author and creator of all
ages? or what times [[time]] should there be, which were not made by thee? or
how should they pass by, if they never were? seeing then thou art [[arts]] the
creator of all times [[time]], if any [[time]] was before thou madest [[heaven]] and
earth, why say they that thou didst forego working? for that very time
didst thou make, nor could times [[time]] pass by, before thou madest those
times. but if before [[heaven]] and [[earth]] there was no [[time]], why is it
demanded, what thou then didst? for there was no "then," when there was
no [[time]].

nor dost thou by [[time]], precede [[time]]: else shouldest thou not precede
all times [[time]]. but thou precedest all things [[past]], by the sublimity of
an ever-present eternity; and surpassest all future because they are
future, and when they come, they shall be [[past]]; but thou art [[arts]] the same,
and thy years fail not. thy years neither come nor go; whereas ours both
come and go, that they all may come. thy years stand together, because
they do stand; nor are departing thrust out by coming years, for they
pass not away; but ours shall all be, when they shall no more be. thy
years are one day; and thy day is not daily, but to-day, seeing thy
to-day gives not place unto to-morrow, for neither doth it replace
yesterday. thy to-day, is eternity; therefore didst thou beget the
coeternal, to whom thou saidst, this day have i begotten thee. thou hast
made all things; and before all times [[time]] thou art [[arts]]: neither in any [[time]] was
time not.

at no [[time]] then hadst thou not made any thing, because [[time]] itself thou
madest. and no times [[time]] are coeternal with thee, because thou abidest;
but if they abode, they should not be times [[time]]. for what is [[time]]? who can
readily and briefly explain this? who can even in [[thought]] comprehend it,
so as to utter a word about it? but what in discourse do we mention more
familiarly and knowingly, than [[time]]? and, we [[understand]], when we speak
of it; we [[understand]] also, when we hear it spoken of by another. what
then is [[time]]? if no one asks me, i [[know]]: if i [[wish]] to explain it to one
that asketh, i [[know]] not: yet i say boldly that i [[know]], that if nothing
passed away, [[time]] [[past]] were not; and if nothing were coming, a [[time]] to
come were not; and if nothing were, [[time]] [[present]] were not. those two
times then, [[past]] and to come, how are they, seeing the [[past]] now is
not, and that to come is not yet? but the [[present]], should it always be
present, and never pass into [[time]] [[past]], verily it should not be [[time]],
but eternity. if [[time]] [[present]] (if it is to be time) only cometh into
existence, because it passeth into [[time]] [[past]], how can we say that either
this is, whose cause of being is, that it shall not be; so, namely, that
we cannot truly say that [[time]] is, but because it is tending not to be?

and yet we say, "a long time" and "a short time"; still, only of time
past or to come. a long [[time]] [[past]] (for example) we call an hundred years
since; and a long [[time]] to come, an hundred years hence. but a short
time [[past]], we call (suppose) often days since; and a short [[time]] to come,
often days hence. but in what sense is that long or short, which is not?
for the [[past]], is not now; and the future, is not yet. let us not then
say, "it is long"; but of the [[past]], "it hath been long"; and of the
future, "it will be long." o my [[lord]], my [[light]], shall not here also thy
truth mock at [[man]]? for that [[past]] [[time]] which was long, was it long when
it was now [[past]], or when it was yet [[present]]? for then might it be long,
when there was, what could be long; but when [[past]], it was no longer;
wherefore neither could that be long, which was not at all. let us not
then say, "time [[past]] hath been long": for we shall not find, what hath
been long, seeing that since it was [[past]], it is no more, but let us say,
"that [[present]] [[time]] was long"; because, when it was [[present]], it was long.
for it had not yet passed away, so as not to be; and therefore there
was, what could be long; but after it was [[past]], that ceased also to be
long, which ceased to be.

let us see then, thou [[soul]] of [[man]], whether [[present]] [[time]] can be long:
for to thee it is given to [[feel]] and to measure length of [[time]]. what wilt
thou [[answer]] me? are an hundred years, when [[present]], a long [[time]]? see
first, whether an hundred years can be [[present]]. for if the first of
these years be now current, it is [[present]], but the other ninety and
nine are to come, and therefore are not yet, but if the second year be
current, one is now [[past]], another [[present]], the rest to come. and so if
we assume any middle year of this hundred to be [[present]], all before it,
are [[past]]; all after it, to come; wherefore an hundred years cannot be
present. but see at least whether that one which is now current, itself
is [[present]]; for if the current month be its first, the rest are to come;
if the second, the first is already [[past]], and the rest are not yet.
therefore, neither is the year now current [[present]]; and if not present
as a whole, then is not the year [[present]]. for twelve months are a year;
of which whatever by the current month is [[present]]; the rest [[past]], or to
come. although neither is that current month [[present]]; but one day only;
the rest being to come, if it be the first; [[past]], if the [[last]]; if any of
the middle, then amid [[past]] and to come.

see how the [[present]] [[time]], which alone we found could be called long, is
abridged to the length scarce of one day. but let us examine that also;
because neither is one day [[present]] as a whole. for it is made up of four
and twenty hours of night and day: of which, the first hath the rest to
come; the [[last]] hath them [[past]]; and any of the middle hath those before
it [[past]], those behind it to come. yea, that one hour passeth away in
flying particles. whatsoever of it hath flown away, is [[past]]; whatsoever
remaineth, is to come. if an instant of [[time]] be conceived, which cannot
be divided into the smallest particles of moments, that alone is it,
which may be called [[present]]. which yet flies with such speed from future
to [[past]], as not to be lengthened out with the least stay. for if it be,
it is divided into [[past]] and future. the [[present]] hath no space. where
then is the [[time]], which we may call long? is it to come? of it we do not
say, "it is long"; because it is not yet, so as to be long; but we say,
"it will be long." when therefore will it be? for if even then, when it
is yet to come, it shall not be long (because what can be long, as yet
is not), and so it shall then be long, when from future which as yet is
not, it shall begin now to be, and have become [[present]], that so there
should [[exist]] what may be long; then does [[time]] [[present]] cry out in the
words above, that it cannot be long.

and yet, [[lord]], we perceive intervals of times [[time]], and compare them, and
say, some are shorter, and others longer. we measure also, how much
longer or shorter this [[time]] is than that; and we [[answer]], "this is
double, or treble; and that, but once, or only just so much as that."
but we measure times [[time]] as they are passing, by perceiving them; but [[past]],
which now are not, or the future, which are not yet, who can measure?
unless a [[man]] shall presume to say, that can be measured, which is not.
when then [[time]] is passing, it may be perceived and measured; but when it
is [[past]], it cannot, because it is not.

i ask, [[father]], i affirm not: o my [[god]], [[rule]] and guide me. "who will tell
me that there are not three times [[time]] (as we learned when boys, and taught
boys), [[past]], [[present]], and future; but [[present]] only, because those two
are not? or are they also; and when from future it becometh [[present]],
doth it come out of some secret place; and so, when retiring, from
present it becometh [[past]]? for where did they, who foretold things to
come, see them, if as yet they be not? for that which is not, cannot be
seen. and they who relate things [[past]], could not relate them, if in mind
they did not discern them, and if they were not, they could no way be
discerned. things then [[past]] and to come, are."

permit me, [[lord]], to seek further. o my [[hope]], let not my [[purpose]] be
confounded. for if times [[time]] [[past]] and to come be, i would [[know]] where they
be. which yet if i cannot, yet i [[know]], wherever they be, they are not
there as future, or [[past]], but [[present]]. for if there also they be future,
they are not yet there; if there also they be [[past]], they are no longer
there. wheresoever then is whatsoever is, it is only as [[present]].
although when [[past]] facts [[fact]] are related, there are drawn out of the memory,
not the things themselves which are [[past]], but words which, conceived by
the images of the things, they, in passing, have through the senses left
as traces in the [[mind]]. thus my [[childhood]], which now is not, is in time
past, which now is not: but now when i recall its image, and tell of it,
i behold it in the [[present]], because it is still in my memory. whether
there be a like cause of foretelling things to come also; that of
things which as yet are not, the images may be perceived before, already
existing, i confess, o my [[god]], i [[know]] not. this indeed i [[know]], that we
generally [[think]] before on our future actions, and that that forethinking
is [[present]], but the action whereof we forethink is not yet, because it
is to come. which, when we have set upon, and have begun to do what
we were forethinking, then shall that action be; because then it is no
longer future, but [[present]].

which way soever then this secret fore-perceiving of things to come be;
that only can be seen, which is. but what now is, is not future,
but [[present]]. when then things to come are said to be seen, it is not
themselves which as yet are not (that is, which are to be), but their
causes perchance or signs are seen, which already are. therefore they
are not future but [[present]] to those who now see that, from which
the future, being foreconceived in the [[mind]], is foretold. which
fore-conceptions again now are; and those who foretell those things, do
behold the conceptions [[present]] before them. let now the numerous variety
of things furnish me some [[example]]. i behold the day-break, i foreshow,
that the sun, is about to rise. what i behold, is [[present]]; what i
foresignify, to come; not the sun, which already is; but the sun-rising,
which is not yet. and yet did i not in my [[mind]] imagine the sun-rising
itself (as now while i speak of it), i could not foretell it. but
neither is that day-break which i discern in the [[sky]], the sun-rising,
although it goes before it; nor that [[imagination]] of my [[mind]]; which two
are seen now [[present]], that the other which is to be may be foretold.
future things then are not yet: and if they be not yet, they are not:
and if they are not, they cannot be seen; yet foretold they may be from
things [[present]], which are already, and are seen.

thou then, ruler of thy creation, by what way dost thou [[teach]] souls
things to come? for thou didst [[teach]] thy prophets [[prophet]]. by what way dost
thou, to whom nothing is to come, [[teach]] things to come; or rather of the
future, dost [[teach]] things [[present]]? for, what is not, neither can it be
taught. too far is this way of my ken: it is too mighty for me, i cannot
attain unto it; but from thee i can, when thou shalt vouchsafe it, o
sweet [[light]] of my hidden [[eyes]].

what now is clear and plain is, that neither things to come nor past
are. nor is it properly said, "there be three times [[time]], [[past]], [[present]],
and to come": yet perchance it might be properly said, "there be three
times; a [[present]] of things [[past]], a [[present]] of things [[present]], and a
present of things future." for these three do [[exist]] in some sort, in the
soul, but otherwhere do i not see them; [[present]] of things [[past]], memory;
present of things [[present]], sight; [[present]] of things future, expectation.
if thus we be permitted to speak, i see three times [[time]], and i confess there
are three. let it be said too, "there be three times [[time]], [[past]], [[present]], and
to come": in our incorrect way. see, i object not, nor gainsay, nor find
fault, if what is so said be but understood, that neither what is to be,
now is, nor what is [[past]]. for but few things are there, which we
speak properly, most things improperly; still the things intended are
understood.

i said then even now, we measure times [[time]] as they pass, in order to be able
to say, this [[time]] is twice so much as that one; or, this is just so
much as that; and so of any other parts of [[time]], which be measurable.
wherefore, as i said, we measure times [[time]] as they pass. and if any should
ask me, "how knowest thou?" i might [[answer]], "i [[know]], that we do measure,
nor can we measure things that are not; and things [[past]] and to come, are
not." but [[time]] [[present]] how do we measure, seeing it hath no space? it
is measured while passing, but when it shall have passed, it is not
measured; for there will be nothing to be measured. but whence, by what
way, and whither passes it while it is a measuring? whence, but from the
future? which way, but through the [[present]]? whither, but into the [[past]]?
from that therefore, which is not yet, through that, which hath no
space, into that, which now is not. yet what do we measure, if not time
in some space? for we do not say, [[single]], and double, and triple, and
equal, or any other like way that we speak of [[time]], except of spaces
of times [[time]]. in what space then do we measure [[time]] passing? in the future,
whence it passeth through? but what is not yet, we measure not. or in
the [[present]], by which it passes? but no space, we do not measure: or in
the [[past]], to which it passes? but neither do we measure that, which now
is not.

my [[soul]] is on [[fire]] to [[know]] this most intricate enigma. shut it not up, o
lord my [[god]], [[good]] [[father]]; through [[christ]] i beseech thee, do not shut up
these usual, yet hidden things, from my [[desire]], that it be hindered from
piercing into them; but let them dawn through thy enlightening [[mercy]], o
lord. whom shall i enquire of concerning these things? and to whom shall
i more fruitfully confess my ignorance, than to thee, to whom these
my studies, so vehemently kindled toward thy scriptures [[scripture]], are not
troublesome? give what i [[love]]; for i do [[love]], and this hast thou
given me. give, [[father]], who truly knowest to give [[good]] gifts unto thy
children. give, because i have taken upon me to [[know]], and trouble is
before me until thou openest it. by [[christ]] i beseech thee, in his name,
holy of holies, let no [[man]] disturb me. for i believed, and therefore do
i speak. this is my [[hope]], for this do i [[live]], that i may contemplate the
delights of the [[lord]]. behold, thou hast made my days old, and they pass
away, and how, i [[know]] not. and we talk of [[time]], and [[time]], and times [[time]], and
times, "how long [[time]] is it since he said this"; "how long [[time]] since he
did this"; and "how long [[time]] since i saw that"; and "this syllable hath
double [[time]] to that [[single]] short syllable." these words we speak, and
these we hear, and are understood, and [[understand]]. most manifest and
ordinary they are, and the self-same things again are but too deeply
hidden, and the discovery of them were new.

i heard once from a learned [[man]], that the motions of the sun, moon,
and stars, constituted [[time]], and i assented not. for why should not
the motions of all bodies [[body]] rather be times [[time]]? or, if the lights [[light]] of heaven
should cease, and a potter's wheel run round, should there be no time
by which we might measure those whirlings, and say, that either it
moved with [[equal]] pauses, or if it turned sometimes slower, otherwhiles
quicker, that some rounds were longer, other shorter? or, while we were
saying this, should we not also be speaking in [[time]]? or, should there
in our words be some syllables short, others long, but because those
sounded in a shorter [[time]], these in a longer? [[god]], grant to [[men]] to see
in a small thing notices [[common]] to things [[great]] and small. the stars and
lights of [[heaven]], are also for signs, and for seasons, and for years,
and for days; they are; yet neither should i say, that the going round
of that wooden wheel was a day, nor yet he, that it was therefore no
time.

i [[desire]] to [[know]] the [[force]] and [[nature]] of [[time]], by which we measure the
motions of bodies [[body]], and say (for example) this motion is twice as long as
that. for i ask, seeing "day" denotes not the stay only of the sun upon
the [[earth]] (according to which day is one thing, night another); but also
its whole circuit from east to east again; according to which we say,
"there passed so many days," the night being included when we say, "so
many days," and the nights not reckoned apart;--seeing then a day is
completed by the motion of the sun and by his circuit from east to east
again, i ask, does the motion alone make the day, or the stay in which
that motion is completed, or both? for if the first be the day; then
should we have a day, although the sun should finish that course in so
small a space of [[time]], as one hour comes to. if the second, then should
not that make a day, if between one sun-rise and another there were
but so short a stay, as one hour comes to; but the sun must go four and
twenty times [[time]] about, to complete one day. if both, then neither could
that be called a day; if the sun should run his whole round in the
space of one hour; nor that, if, while the sun stood still, so much
time should overpass, as the sun usually makes his whole course in, from
morning to morning. i will not therefore now ask, what that is which is
called day; but, what [[time]] is, whereby we, measuring the circuit of the
sun, should say that it was finished in half the [[time]] it was wont, if
so be it was finished in so small a space as twelve hours; and comparing
both times [[time]], should call this a [[single]] [[time]], that a double [[time]]; even
supposing the sun to run his round from east to east, sometimes in that
single, sometimes in that double [[time]]. let no [[man]] then tell me, that the
motions of the heavenly bodies [[body]] constitute times [[time]], because, when at
the prayer of one, the sun had stood still, till he could achieve his
victorious [[battle]], the sun stood still, but [[time]] went on. for in its own
allotted space of [[time]] was that [[battle]] waged and ended. i perceive
time then to be a [[certain]] extension. but do i perceive it, or seem to
perceive it? thou, [[light]] and [[truth]], wilt show me.

dost thou bid me assent, if any define [[time]] to be "motion of a [[body]]?"
thou dost not bid me. for that no [[body]] is moved, but in [[time]], i hear;
this thou sayest; but that the motion of a [[body]] is [[time]], i hear not;
thou sayest it not. for when a [[body]] is moved, i by [[time]] measure, how
long it moveth, from the [[time]] it began to move until it left off? and if
i did not see whence it began; and it continue to move so that i see not
when it ends, i cannot measure, save perchance from the [[time]] i began,
until i cease to see. and if i look long, i can only pronounce it to be
a long [[time]], but not how long; because when we say "how long," we do
it by comparison; as, "this is as long as that," or "twice so long as
that," or the like. but when we can mark the distances of the places,
whence and whither goeth the [[body]] moved, or his parts, if it moved as in
a lathe, then can we say precisely, in how much [[time]] the motion of
that [[body]] or his part, from this place unto that, was finished. seeing
therefore the motion of a [[body]] is one thing, that by which we measure
how long it is, another; who sees not, which of the two is rather to
be called [[time]]? for and if a [[body]] be sometimes moved, sometimes stands
still, then we measure, not his motion only, but his standing still too
by [[time]]; and we say, "it stood still, as much as it moved"; or "it stood
still twice or thrice so long as it moved"; or any other space which our
measuring hath either ascertained, or guessed; more or less, as we use
to say. [[time]] then is not the motion of a [[body]].

and i confess to thee, o [[lord]], that i yet [[know]] not what [[time]] is, and
again i confess unto thee, o [[lord]], that i [[know]] that i speak this in
time, and that having long spoken of [[time]], that very "long" is not long,
but by the pause of [[time]]. how then [[know]] i this, seeing i [[know]] not what
time is? or is it perchance that i [[know]] not how to express what i [[know]]?
woe is me, that do not even [[know]], what i [[know]] not. behold, o my [[god]],
before thee i [[lie]] not; but as i speak, so is my [[heart]]. thou shalt light
my candle; thou, o [[lord]] my [[god]], wilt enlighten my darkness.

does not my [[soul]] most truly confess unto thee, that i do measure times [[time]]?
do i then measure, o my [[god]], and [[know]] not what i measure? i measure the
motion of a [[body]] in [[time]]; and the [[time]] itself do i not measure? or could
i indeed measure the motion of a [[body]] how long it were, and in how long
space it could come from this place to that, without measuring the time
in which it is moved? this same [[time]] then, how do i measure? do we by a
shorter [[time]] measure a longer, as by the space of a cubit, the space
of a rood? for so indeed we seem by the space of a short syllable, to
measure the space of a long syllable, and to say that this is double
the other. thus measure we the spaces of stanzas, by the spaces of the
verses, and the spaces of the verses, by the spaces of the feet, and the
spaces of the feet, by the spaces of the syllables, and the spaces of
long, by the space of short syllables; not measuring by pages (for then
we measure spaces, not times); but when we utter the words and they pass
by, and we say "it is a long stanza," because composed of so many verses;
long verses, because consisting of so many feet; long feet, because
prolonged by so many syllables; a long syllable because double to a
short one. but neither do we this way obtain any [[certain]] measure of
time; because it may be, that a shorter verse, pronounced more fully,
may take up more [[time]] than a longer, pronounced hurriedly. and so for a
verse, a foot, a syllable. whence it seemed to me, that [[time]] is nothing
else than protraction; but of what, i [[know]] not; and i marvel, if it
be not of the [[mind]] itself? for what, i beseech thee, o my [[god]], do i
measure, when i say, either indefinitely "this is a longer [[time]] than
that," or definitely "this is double that"? that i measure [[time]], i [[know]];
and yet i measure not [[time]] to come, for it is not yet; nor [[present]],
because it is not protracted by any space; nor [[past]], because it now is
not. what then do i measure? times [[time]] passing, not [[past]]? for so i said.

courage, my [[mind]], and press on mightily. [[god]] is our helper, he made us,
and not we ourselves. press on where [[truth]] begins to dawn. suppose, now,
the voice of a [[body]] begins to sound, and does sound, and sounds on, and
list, it ceases; it is [[silence]] now, and that voice is [[past]], and is
no more a voice. before it sounded, it was to come, and could not be
measured, because as yet it was not, and now it cannot, because it is
no longer. then therefore while it sounded, it might; because there then
was what might be measured. but yet even then it was not at a stay; for
it was passing on, and passing away. could it be measured the rather,
for that? for while passing, it was being extended into some space of
time, so that it might be measured, since the [[present]] hath no space. if
therefore then it might, then, lo, suppose another voice hath begun
to sound, and still soundeth in one continued tenor without any
interruption; let us measure it while it sounds; seeing when it hath
left sounding, it will then be [[past]], and nothing left to be measured;
let us measure it verily, and tell how much it is. but it sounds still,
nor can it be measured but from the instant it began in, unto the end
it left in. for the very space between is the thing we measure, namely,
from some beginning unto some end. wherefore, a voice that is not yet
ended, cannot be measured, so that it may be said how long, or short it
is; nor can it be called [[equal]] to another, or double to a [[single]], or the
like. but when ended, it no longer is. how may it then be measured? and
yet we measure times [[time]]; but yet neither those which are not yet, nor those
which no longer are, nor those which are not lengthened out by some
pause, nor those which have no bounds. we measure neither times [[time]] to come,
nor [[past]], nor [[present]], nor passing; and yet we do measure times [[time]].

"deus creator omnium," this verse of eight syllables alternates between
short and long syllables. the four short then, the first, third, fifth,
and seventh, are but [[single]], in [[respect]] of the four long, the second,
fourth, sixth, and eighth. every one of these to every one of those,
hath a double [[time]]: i pronounce them, report on them, and find it so,
as one's plain sense perceives. by plain sense then, i measure a long
syllable by a short, and i sensibly find it to have twice so much; but
when one sounds after the other, if the former be short, the latter
long, how shall i detain the short one, and how, measuring, shall i
apply it to the long, that i may find this to have twice so much; seeing
the long does not begin to sound, unless the short leaves sounding? and
that very long one do i measure as [[present]], seeing i measure it not
till it be ended? now his ending is his passing away. what then is it i
measure? where is the short syllable by which i measure? where the long
which i measure? both have sounded, have flown, passed away, are no
more; and yet i measure, and confidently [[answer]] (so far as is presumed
on a practised sense) that as to space of [[time]] this syllable is but
single, that double. and yet i could not do this, unless they were
already [[past]] and ended. it is not then themselves, which now are not,
that i measure, but something in my memory, which there remains fixed.

it is in thee, my [[mind]], that i measure times [[time]]. interrupt me not, that
is, interrupt not thyself with the tumults of thy impressions. in thee
i measure times [[time]]; the impression, which things as they pass by cause in
thee, remains even when they are gone; this it is which still [[present]],
i measure, not the things which pass by to make this impression. this
i measure, when i measure times [[time]]. either then this is [[time]], or i do not
measure times [[time]]. what when we measure [[silence]], and say that this silence
hath held as long [[time]] as did that voice? do we not stretch out our
thought to the measure of a voice, as if it sounded, that so we may be
able to report of the intervals of [[silence]] in a given space of [[time]]? for
though both voice and tongue be still, yet in [[thought]] we go over poems,
and verses, and any other discourse, or dimensions of motions, and
report as to the spaces of times [[time]], how much this is in [[respect]] of that,
no otherwise than if vocally we did pronounce them. if a [[man]] would utter
a lengthened sound, and had settled in [[thought]] how long it should be, he
hath in [[silence]] already gone through a space of [[time]], and committing
it to memory, begins to utter that [[speech]], which sounds on, until it be
brought unto the end proposed. yea it hath sounded, and will sound; for
so much of it as is finished, hath sounded already, and the rest will
sound. and thus passeth it on, until the [[present]] intent conveys over
the future into the [[past]]; the [[past]] increasing by the diminution of the
future, until by the consumption of the future, all is [[past]].

but how is that future diminished or consumed, which as yet is not? or
how that [[past]] increased, which is now no longer, save that in the mind
which enacteth this, there be three things done? for it expects, it
considers, it remembers; that so that which it expecteth, through
that which it considereth, passeth into that which it remembereth. who
therefore denieth, that things to come are not as yet? and yet, there is
in the [[mind]] an expectation of things to come. and who denies [[past]] things
to be now no longer? and yet is there still in the [[mind]] a memory of
things [[past]]. and who denieth the [[present]] [[time]] hath no space, because it
passeth away in a moment? and yet our consideration continueth, through
which that which shall be [[present]] proceedeth to become absent. it is not
then future [[time]], that is long, for as yet it is not: but a long future,
is "a long expectation of the future," nor is it [[time]] [[past]], which now is
not, that is long; but a long [[past]], is "a long memory of the [[past]]."

i am about to repeat a psalm that i [[know]]. before i begin, my expectation
is extended over the whole; but when i have begun, how much soever of
it i shall separate off into the [[past]], is extended along my memory; thus
the [[life]] of this action of mine is divided between my memory as to what
i have repeated, and expectation as to what i am about to repeat; but
"consideration" is [[present]] with me, that through it what was future, may
be conveyed over, so as to become [[past]]. which the more it is done again
and again, so much the more the expectation being shortened, is the
memory enlarged: till the whole expectation be at length exhausted, when
that whole action being ended, shall have passed into memory. and this
which takes place in the whole psalm, the same takes place in each
several portion of it, and each several syllable; the same holds in that
longer action, whereof this psalm may be part; the same holds in the
whole [[life]] of [[man]], whereof all the actions of [[man]] are parts; the same
holds through the whole [[age]] of the sons [[son]] of [[men]], whereof all the lives [[life]] of
men are parts.

but because thy loving-kindness is [[better]] than all lives [[life]], behold, my
life is but a distraction, and thy [[right]] hand upheld me, in my [[lord]] the
son of [[man]], the mediator betwixt thee, the one, and us many, many also
through our manifold distractions amid many things, that by him i may
apprehend in whom i have been apprehended, and may be re-collected from
my old conversation, to [[follow]] the one, forgetting what is behind, and
not distended but extended, not to things which shall be and shall
pass away, but to those things which are before, not distractedly but
intently, i [[follow]] on for the prize of my heavenly calling, where i may
hear the voice of thy [[praise]], and contemplate thy delights, neither
to come, nor to pass away. but now are my years spent in mourning. and
thou, o [[lord]], art [[arts]] my comfort, my [[father]] everlasting, but i have been
severed amid times [[time]], whose order i [[know]] not; and my thoughts [[thought]], even
the inmost bowels of my [[soul]], are rent and mangled with tumultuous
varieties, until i flow together into thee, purified and molten by the
fire of thy [[love]].

and now will i stand, and become firm in thee, in my mould, thy [[truth]];
nor will i endure the questions [[question]] of [[men]], who by a penal disease thirst
for more than they can contain, and say, "what did [[god]] before he made
heaven and [[earth]]?" or, "how came it into his [[mind]] to make any thing,
having never before made any thing?" give them, o [[lord]], well to
bethink themselves what they say, and to find, that "never" cannot be
predicated, when "time" is not. this then that he is said "never to have
made"; what else is it to say, than "in 'no time' to have made?" let
them see therefore, that [[time]] cannot be without created being, and cease
to speak that vanity. may they also be extended towards those things
which are before; and [[understand]] thee before all times [[time]], the eternal
creator of all times [[time]], and that no times [[time]] be coeternal with thee, nor any
creature, even if there be any creature before all times [[time]].

o [[lord]] my [[god]], what a depth is that recess of thy mysteries, and how far
from it have the consequences of my transgressions cast me! heal mine
eyes, that i may share the joy of thy [[light]]. certainly, if there be mind
gifted with such vast [[knowledge]] and foreknowledge, as to [[know]] all things
past and to come, as i [[know]] one well-known psalm, truly that [[mind]] is
passing wonderful, and fearfully amazing; in that nothing [[past]], nothing
to come in after-ages, is any more hidden from him, than when i sung
that psalm, was hidden from me what, and how much of it had passed away
from the beginning, what, and how much there remained unto the end. but
far be it that thou the creator of the [[universe]], the creator of souls
and bodies [[body]], far be it, that thou shouldest in such [[wise]] [[know]] all things
past and to come. far, far more wonderfully, and far more mysteriously,
dost thou [[know]] them. for not, as the feelings of one who singeth what he
knoweth, or heareth some well-known [[song]], are through expectation of the
words to come, and the remembering of those that are [[past]], varied,
and his senses divided,--not so doth any thing happen unto thee,
unchangeably eternal, that is, the eternal creator of minds [[mind]]. like then
as thou in the beginning knewest the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]], without any
variety of thy [[knowledge]], so madest thou in the beginning [[heaven]] and
earth, without any distraction of thy action. whoso understandeth, let
him confess unto thee; and whoso understandeth not, let him confess
unto thee. oh how high art [[arts]] thou, and yet the humble in [[heart]] are thy
dwelling-place; for thou raisest up those that are bowed down, and they
fall not, whose elevation thou art [[arts]].




book xii


my [[heart]], o [[lord]], touched with the words of thy holy [[scripture]], is much
busied, amid this [[poverty]] of my [[life]]. and therefore most times [[time]], is the
poverty of [[human]] understanding copious in words, because enquiring hath
more to say than discovering, and demanding is longer than obtaining,
and our hand that knocks, hath more [[work]] to do, than our hand that
receives. we hold the promise, who shall make it null? if [[god]] be for us,
who can be against us? ask, and ye shall have; seek, and ye shall find;
knock, and it shall be opened unto you. for every one that asketh,
receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh,
shall it be opened. these be thine own promises: and who need [[fear]] to be
deceived, when the [[truth]] promiseth?

the lowliness of my tongue confesseth unto thy highness, that thou
madest [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; this [[heaven]] which i see, and this [[earth]] that i
tread upon, whence is this [[earth]] that i bear about me; thou madest it.
but where is that [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]], o [[lord]], which we hear of in the
words of the psalm. the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]] are the lord's; but the earth
hath he given to the [[children]] of [[men]]? where is that [[heaven]] which we see
not, to which all this which we see is [[earth]]? for this corporeal whole,
not being wholly every where, hath in such [[wise]] received its portion of
beauty in these lower parts, whereof the lowest is this our [[earth]]; but
to that [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]], even the [[heaven]] of our [[earth]], is but [[earth]]:
yea both these [[great]] bodies [[body]], may not absurdly be called [[earth]], to that
unknown [[heaven]], which is the lord's, not the sons' of [[men]].

and now this [[earth]] was invisible and without form, and there was i know
not what depth of abyss, upon which there was no [[light]], because it had
no shape. therefore didst thou command it to be written, that darkness
was upon the face of the deep; what else than the absence of [[light]]? for
had there been [[light]], where should it have been but by being over all,
aloft, and enlightening? where then [[light]] was not, what was the presence
of darkness, but the absence of [[light]]? darkness therefore was upon it,
because [[light]] was not upon it; as where sound is not, there is [[silence]].
and what is it to have [[silence]] there, but to have no sound there? hast
not thou, o [[lord]], taught his [[soul]], which confesseth unto thee? hast not
thou taught me, [[lord]], that before thou formedst and diversifiedst this
formless matter, there was nothing, neither colour, nor figure, nor
body, nor spirit? and yet not altogether nothing; for there was a
certain formlessness, without any [[beauty]].

how then should it be called, that it might be in some measure conveyed
to those of duller [[mind]], but by some ordinary word? and what, among all
parts of the [[world]] can be found nearer to an absolute formlessness, than
earth and deep? for, occupying the lowest stage, they are less beautiful
than the other higher parts are, transparent all and shining. wherefore
then may i not conceive the formlessness of matter (which thou hadst
created without [[beauty]], whereof to make this beautiful world) to be
suitably intimated unto [[men]], by the name of [[earth]] invisible and without
form.

so that when [[thought]] seeketh what the sense may conceive under this,
and saith to itself, "it is no intellectual form, as [[life]], or [[justice]];
because it is the matter of bodies [[body]]; nor object of sense, because being
invisible, and without form, there was in it no object of sight or
sense";--while man's [[man]] [[thought]] thus saith to itself, it may endeavour
either to [[know]] it, by being ignorant of it; or to be ignorant, by
knowing it.

but i, [[lord]], if i would, by my tongue and my pen, confess unto thee the
whole, whatever thyself hath taught me of that matter,--the name whereof
hearing before, and not understanding, when they who understood it not,
told me of it, so i conceived of it as having innumerable forms and
diverse, and therefore did not conceive it at all, my [[mind]] tossed up and
down foul and horrible "forms" out of all order, but yet "forms" and i
called it without form not that it wanted all form, but because it had
such as my [[mind]] would, if presented to it, turn from, as unwonted and
jarring, and [[human]] frailness would be troubled at. and still that which
i conceived, was without form, not as being deprived of all form, but
in comparison of more beautiful forms; and true [[reason]] did persuade me,
that i must utterly uncase it of all remnants of form whatsoever, if
i would conceive matter absolutely without form; and i could not; for
sooner could i imagine that not to be at all, which should be deprived
of all form, than conceive a thing betwixt form and nothing, neither
formed, nor nothing, a formless almost nothing. so my [[mind]] gave over to
question thereupon with my spirit, it being filled with the images of
formed bodies [[body]], and changing and varying them, as it willed; and i bent
myself to the bodies [[body]] themselves, and looked more deeply into their
changeableness, by which they cease to be what they have been, and begin
to be what they were not; and this same shifting from form to form, i
suspected to be through a [[certain]] formless [[state]], not through a mere
nothing; yet this i longed to [[know]], not to suspect only.-if then my
voice and pen would confess unto thee the whole, whatsoever knots thou
didst open for me in this [[question]], what reader would hold out to take
in the whole? nor shall my [[heart]] for all this cease to give thee [[honour]],
and a [[song]] of [[praise]], for those things which it is not able to express.
for the changeableness of changeable things, is itself capable of all
those forms, into which these changeable things are changed. and this
changeableness, what is it? is it [[soul]]? is it [[body]]? is it that which
constituteth [[soul]] or [[body]]? might one say, "a nothing something", an
"is, is not," i would say, this were it: and yet in some way was it even
then, as being capable of receiving these visible and compound figures.

but whence had it this [[degree]] of being, but from thee, from whom are all
things, so far forth as they are? but so much the further from thee, as
the unliker thee; for it is not farness of place. thou therefore,
lord, who art [[arts]] not one in one place, and otherwise in another, but the
self-same, and the self-same, and the self-same, holy, holy, holy, lord
god almighty, didst in the beginning, which is of thee, in thy [[wisdom]],
which was born of thine own substance, create something, and that out of
nothing. for thou createdst [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; not out of thyself, for so
should they have been [[equal]] to thine only begotten [[son]], and thereby to
thee also; whereas no way were it [[right]] that aught should be [[equal]] to
thee, which was not of thee. and aught else besides thee was there not,
whereof thou mightest create them, o [[god]], one trinity, and trine unity;
and therefore out of nothing didst thou create [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; a great
thing, and a small thing; for thou art [[arts]] almighty and [[good]], to make all
things [[good]], even the [[great]] [[heaven]], and the petty [[earth]]. thou wert, and
nothing was there besides, out of which thou createdst [[heaven]] and [[earth]];
things of two sorts; one near thee, the other near to nothing; one to
which thou alone shouldest be superior; the other, to which nothing
should be inferior.

but that [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]] was for thyself, o [[lord]]; but the [[earth]] which
thou gavest to the sons [[son]] of [[men]], to be seen and [[felt]], was not such as we
now see and [[feel]]. for it was invisible, without form, and there was a
deep, upon which there was no [[light]]; or, darkness was above the deep,
that is, more than in the deep. because this deep of waters, visible
now, hath even in his depths, a [[light]] proper for its [[nature]]; perceivable
in whatever [[degree]] unto the fishes, and creeping things in the bottom
of it. but that whole deep was almost nothing, because hitherto it
was altogether without form; yet there was already that which could be
formed. for thou, [[lord]], madest the [[world]] of a matter without form, which
out of nothing, thou madest next to nothing, thereof to make those
great things, which we sons [[son]] of [[men]] wonder at. for very wonderful is this
corporeal [[heaven]]; of which firmament between water and water, the second
day, after the creation of [[light]], thou saidst, let it be made, and it
was made. which firmament thou calledst [[heaven]]; the [[heaven]], that is, to
this [[earth]] and sea, which thou madest the third day, by giving a visible
figure to the formless matter, which thou madest before all days. for
already hadst thou made both an [[heaven]], before all days; but that was
the [[heaven]] of this [[heaven]]; because in the beginning thou hadst made
heaven and [[earth]]. but this same [[earth]] which thou madest was formless
matter, because it was invisible and without form, and darkness was
upon the deep, of which invisible [[earth]] and without form, of which
formlessness, of which almost nothing, thou mightest make all these
things of which this changeable [[world]] consists, but subsists not; whose
very changeableness appears therein, that times [[time]] can be observed and
numbered in it. for times [[time]] are made by the alterations of things, while
the figures, the matter whereof is the invisible [[earth]] aforesaid, are
varied and turned.

and therefore the spirit, the teacher of thy servant, when it recounts
thee to have in the beginning created [[heaven]] and [[earth]], speaks nothing
of times [[time]], nothing of days. for verily that [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]] which
thou createdst in the beginning, is some intellectual creature, which,
although no ways coeternal unto thee, the trinity, yet partaketh of
thy eternity, and doth through the sweetness of that most happy
contemplation of thyself, strongly restrain its own changeableness; and
without any fall since its first creation, cleaving close unto thee, is
placed beyond all the rolling vicissitude of times [[time]]. yea, neither is this
very formlessness of the [[earth]], invisible, and without form, numbered
among the days. for where no figure nor order is, there does nothing
come, or go; and where this is not, there plainly are no days, nor any
vicissitude of spaces of times [[time]].

o let the [[light]], the [[truth]], the [[light]] of my [[heart]], not mine own
darkness, speak unto me. i fell off into that, and became darkened; but
even thence, even thence i loved thee. i went astray, and remembered
thee. i heard thy voice behind me, calling to me to return, and scarcely
heard it, through the tumultuousness of the enemies [[enemy]] of [[peace]]. and now,
behold, i return in distress and panting after thy fountain. let no man
forbid me! of this will i drink, and so [[live]]. let me not be mine own
life; from myself i lived ill, [[death]] was i to myself; and i revive in
thee. do thou speak unto me, do thou discourse unto me. i have believed
thy books [[book]], and their words be most full of mystery.

already thou hast told me with a [[strong]] voice, o [[lord]], in my inner ear,
that thou art [[arts]] eternal, who only hast immortality; since thou canst not
be changed as to figure or motion, nor is thy will altered by times [[time]]:
seeing no will which varies is [[immortal]]. this is in thy sight clear to
me, and let it be more and more cleared to me, i beseech thee; and in
the manifestation thereof, let me with sobriety abide under thy wings.
thou hast told me also with a [[strong]] voice, o [[lord]], in my inner ear,
that thou hast made all natures [[nature]] and substances, which are not what
thyself is, and yet are; and that only is not from thee, which is not,
and the motion of the will from thee who art [[arts]], unto that which in a less
degree is, because such motion is transgression and [[sin]]; and that no
man's [[sin]] doth either hurt thee, or disturb the order of thy [[government]],
first or [[last]]. this is in thy sight clear unto me, and let it be
more and more cleared to me, i beseech thee: and in the manifestation
thereof, let me with sobriety abide under thy wings.

thou hast told me also with a [[strong]] voice, in my inner ear, that
neither is that creature coeternal unto thyself, whose happiness
thou only art [[arts]], and which with a most persevering purity, drawing its
nourishment from thee, doth in no place and at no [[time]] put forth its
natural mutability; and, thyself being ever [[present]] with it, unto whom
with its whole affection it keeps itself, having neither future to
expect, nor conveying into the [[past]] what it remembereth, is neither
altered by any [[change]], nor distracted into any times [[time]]. o blessed
creature, if such there be, for cleaving unto thy blessedness; blest in
thee, its eternal inhabitant and its enlightener! nor do i find by what
name i may the rather call the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]] which is the lord's,
than thine house, which contemplateth thy delights without any defection
of going forth to another; one pure [[mind]], most harmoniously one, by that
settled estate of [[peace]] of holy spirits, the [[citizens]] of thy [[city]] in
heavenly places; far above those heavenly places that we see.

by this may the [[soul]], whose pilgrimage is made long and far away, by
this may she [[understand]], if she now thirsts for thee, if her tears be
now become her bread, while they daily say unto her, where is thy [[god]]?
if she now seeks of thee one thing, and desireth it, that she may dwell
in thy house all the days of her [[life]] (and what is her [[life]], but thou?
and what thy days, but thy eternity, as thy years which fail not,
because thou art [[arts]] ever the same?); by this then may the [[soul]] that is
able, [[understand]] how far thou art [[arts]], above all times [[time]], eternal; seeing
thy house which at no [[time]] went into a far [[country]], although it be not
coeternal with thee, yet by continually and unfailingly cleaving unto
thee, suffers no changeableness of times [[time]]. this is in thy sight clear
unto me, and let it be more and more cleared unto me, i beseech thee,
and in the manifestation thereof, let me with sobriety abide under thy
wings.

there is, behold, i [[know]] not what formlessness in those changes [[change]] of these
last and lowest creatures; and who shall tell me (unless such a one as
through the emptiness of his own [[heart]], wonders and tosses himself up
and down amid his own fancies?), who but such a one would tell me, that
if all figure be so wasted and consumed away, that there should only
remain that formlessness, through which the thing was changed and turned
from one figure to another, that that could exhibit the vicissitudes
of times [[time]]? for plainly it could not, because, without the variety of
motions, there are no times [[time]]: and no variety, where there is no figure.

these things considered, as much as thou givest, o my [[god]], as much
as thou stirrest me up to knock, and as much as thou openest to me
knocking, two things i find that thou hast made, not within the compass
of [[time]], neither of which is coeternal with thee. one, which is so
formed, that without any ceasing of contemplation, without any interval
of [[change]], though changeable, yet not changed, it may thoroughly enjoy
thy eternity and unchangeableness; the other which was so formless,
that it had not that, which could be changed from one form into another,
whether of motion, or of repose, so as to become [[subject]] unto [[time]]. but
this thou didst not leave thus formless, because before all days, thou
in the beginning didst create [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; the two things that i
spake of. but the [[earth]] was invisible and without form, and darkness
was upon the deep. in which words, is the formlessness conveyed unto us
(that such capacities may hereby be drawn on by degrees [[degree]], as are not
able to conceive an utter privation of all form, without yet coming to
nothing), out of which another [[heaven]] might be created, together with
a visible and well-formed [[earth]]: and the waters diversly ordered, and
whatsoever further is in the formation of the [[world]], recorded to have
been, not without days, created; and that, as being of such [[nature]], that
the successive changes [[change]] of times [[time]] may take place in them, as being subject
to appointed alterations of motions and of forms.

this then is what i conceive, o my [[god]], when i hear thy scripture
saying, in the beginning [[god]] made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]: and the [[earth]] was
invisible and without form, and darkness was upon the deep, and not
mentioning what day thou createdst them; this is what i conceive, that
because of the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]],--that intellectual [[heaven]], whose
intelligences [[know]] all at once, not in part, not darkly, not through a
glass, but as a whole, in manifestation, face to face; not, this thing
now, and that thing anon; but (as i said) [[know]] all at once, without any
succession of times [[time]];--and because of the [[earth]] invisible and without
form, without any succession of times [[time]], which succession presents [[present]] "this
thing now, that thing anon"; because where is no form, there is
no distinction of things:--it is, then, on account of these two, a
primitive formed, and a primitive formless; the one, [[heaven]] but the
heaven of [[heaven]], the other [[earth]] but the [[earth]] invisible and without
form; because of these two do i conceive, did thy [[scripture]] say without
mention of days, in the beginning [[god]] created [[heaven]] and [[earth]]. for
forthwith it subjoined what [[earth]] it spake of; and also, in that the
firmament is recorded to be created the second day, and called [[heaven]],
it conveys to us of which [[heaven]] he before spake, without mention of
days.

wondrous depth of thy words! whose surface, behold! is before us,
inviting to little ones; yet are they a wondrous depth. o my [[god]], a
wondrous depth! it is awful to look therein; an awfulness of [[honour]], and
a trembling of [[love]]. the enemies [[enemy]] thereof i hate vehemently; oh that thou
wouldest slay them with thy two-edged [[sword]], that they might no longer
be enemies [[enemy]] unto it: for so do i [[love]] to have them slain unto themselves,
that they may [[live]] unto thee. but behold others not faultfinders, but
extollers of the [[book]] of genesis; "the spirit of [[god]]," say they, "who
by his servant [[moses]] wrote these things, would not have those words
thus understood; he would not have it understood, as thou sayest, but
otherwise, as we say." unto whom thyself, o thou [[god]] all, being [[judge]],
do i thus [[answer]].

"will you affirm that to be false, which with a [[strong]] voice [[truth]] tells
me in my inner ear, concerning the eternity of the creator, that his
substance is no ways changed by [[time]], nor his will separate from his
substance? wherefore he willeth not one thing now, another anon, but
once, and at once, and always, he willeth all things that he willeth;
not again and again, nor now this, now that; nor willeth afterwards,
what before he willed not, nor willeth not, what before he willed;
because such a will is and no mutable thing is eternal: but our [[god]] is
eternal. again, what he tells me in my inner ear, the expectation of
things to come becomes sight, when they are come, and this same sight
becomes memory, when they be [[past]]. now all [[thought]] which thus varies is
mutable; and no mutable thing is eternal: but our [[god]] is eternal." these
things i infer, and put together, and find that my [[god]], the eternal [[god]],
hath not upon any new will made any creature, nor doth his knowledge
admit of any thing transitory. "what will ye say then, o ye gainsayers?
are these things false?" "no," they say; "what then? is it false, that
every [[nature]] already formed, or matter capable of form, is not, but from
him who is supremely [[good]], because he is supremely?" "neither do we deny
this," say they. "what then? do you deny this, that there is a certain
sublime creature, with so chaste a [[love]] cleaving unto the true and
truly eternal [[god]], that although not coeternal with him, yet is it not
detached from him, nor dissolved into the variety and vicissitude of
times, but reposeth in the most true contemplation of him only?" because
thou, o [[god]], unto him that loveth thee so much as thou commandest, dost
show thyself, and sufficest him; and therefore doth he not decline
from thee, nor toward himself. this is the house of [[god]], not of earthly
mould, nor of celestial bulk corporeal but [[spiritual]], and partaker of
thy eternity, because without defection for ever. for thou hast made
it fast for ever and ever, thou hast given it a [[law]] which it shall not
pass. nor yet is it coeternal with thee, o [[god]], because not without
beginning; for it was made.

for although we find no [[time]] before it, for [[wisdom]] was created before
all things; not that [[wisdom]] which is altogether [[equal]] and coeternal unto
thee, our [[god]], his [[father]], and by whom all things were created, and in
whom, as the beginning, thou createdst [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; but that
wisdom which is created, that is, the intellectual [[nature]], which by
contemplating the [[light]], is [[light]]. for this, though created, is also
called [[wisdom]]. but what difference there is betwixt the [[light]] which
enlighteneth, and which is enlightened, so much is there betwixt the
wisdom that createth, and that created; as betwixt the righteousness
which justifieth, and the [[righteousness]] which is made by justification.
for we also are called thy [[righteousness]]; for so saith a certain
servant of thine, that we might be made the [[righteousness]] of [[god]] in him.
therefore since a [[certain]] created [[wisdom]] was created before all things,
the [[rational]] and intellectual [[mind]] of that chaste [[city]] of thine, our
mother which is above, and is [[free]] and eternal in the heavens [[heaven]] (in
what heavens [[heaven]], if not in those that [[praise]] thee, the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]]?
because this is also the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]] for the lord);--though we
find no [[time]] before it (because that which hath been created before all
things, precedeth also the creature of time), yet is the eternity of
the creator himself before it, from whom, being created, it took the
beginning, not indeed of [[time]] (for [[time]] itself was not yet), but of its
creation.

hence it is so of thee, our [[god]], as to be altogether other than thou,
and not the self-same: because though we find [[time]] neither before it,
nor even in it (it being meet ever to behold thy face, nor is ever drawn
away from it, wherefore it is not varied by any change), yet is there in
it a liability to [[change]], whence it would wax dark, and chill, but
that by a [[strong]] affection cleaving unto thee, like perpetual noon, it
shineth and gloweth from thee. o house most lightsome and delightsome!
i have loved thy [[beauty]], and the place of the habitation of the glory
of my [[lord]], thy builder and possessor. let my wayfaring sigh after thee,
and i say to him that made thee, let him take possession of me also in
thee, seeing he hath made me likewise. i have gone astray like a lost
sheep: yet upon the shoulders of my shepherd, thy builder, [[hope]] i to be
brought back to thee.

"what say ye to me, o ye gainsayers that i was speaking unto, who yet
believe [[moses]] to have been the holy servant of [[god]], and his books [[book]] the
oracles of the holy ghost? is not this house of [[god]], not coeternal
indeed with [[god]], yet after its measure, eternal in the heavens [[heaven]], when you
seek for changes [[change]] of times [[time]] in [[vain]], because you will not find them? for
that, to which it is ever [[good]] to cleave fast to [[god]], surpasses all
extension, and all revolving periods of [[time]]." "it is," say they.
"what then of all that which my [[heart]] loudly uttered unto my [[god]], when
inwardly it heard the voice of his [[praise]], what part thereof do you
affirm to be false? is it that the matter was without form, in which
because there was no form, there was no order? but where no order was,
there could be no vicissitude of times [[time]]: and yet this almost nothing,
inasmuch as it was not altogether nothing, was from him certainly, from
whom is whatsoever is, in what [[degree]] soever it is." "this also," say
they, "do we not deny."

with these i now parley a little in thy presence, o my [[god]], who grant
all these things to be true, which thy [[truth]] whispers unto my [[soul]]. for
those who deny these things, let them bark and deafen themselves as much
as they please; i will essay to persuade them to quiet, and to open in
them a way for thy word. but if they refuse, and repel me; i beseech, o
my [[god]], be not thou silent to me. speak thou truly in my [[heart]]; for
only thou so speakest: and i will let them alone blowing upon the dust
without, and raising it up into their own [[eyes]]: and myself will enter
my chamber, and sing there a [[song]] of loves [[love]] unto thee; groaning with
groanings unutterable, in my wayfaring, and remembering [[jerusalem]], with
heart lifted up towards it, [[jerusalem]] my [[country]], [[jerusalem]] my [[mother]],
and thyself that rulest over it, the enlightener, [[father]], guardian,
husband, the pure and [[strong]] delight, and solid joy, and all [[good]] things
unspeakable, yea all at once, because the one [[sovereign]] and true [[good]].
nor will i be turned away, until thou gather all that i am, from this
dispersed and disordered estate, into the [[peace]] of that our most dear
mother, where the first-fruits of my spirit be already (whence i am
ascertained of these things), and thou conform and confirm it for ever,
o my [[god]], my [[mercy]]. but those who do not affirm all these truths [[truth]] to be
false, who [[honour]] thy holy [[scripture]], set forth by holy [[moses]], placing
it, as we, on the summit of [[authority]] to be followed, and do yet
contradict me in some thing, i [[answer]] thus; by thyself [[judge]], o our [[god]],
between my confessions and these men's contradictions.

for they say, "though these things be true, yet did not [[moses]] intend
those two, when, by revelation of the spirit, he said, in the beginning
god created [[heaven]] and [[earth]]. he did not under the name of [[heaven]],
signify that [[spiritual]] or intellectual creature which always beholds the
face of [[god]]; nor under the name of [[earth]], that formless matter." "what
then?" "that [[man]] of [[god]]," say they, "meant as we say, this declared he
by those words." "what?" "by the name of [[heaven]] and [[earth]] would he first
signify," say they, "universally and compendiously, all this visible
world; so as afterwards by the enumeration of the several days, to
arrange in detail, and, as it were, piece by piece, all those things,
which it pleased the holy ghost thus to enounce. for such were that
rude and carnal [[people]] to which he spake, that he [[thought]] them fit to be
entrusted with the [[knowledge]] of such works [[work]] of [[god]] only as were visible."
they agree, however, that under the words [[earth]] invisible and without
form, and that darksome deep (out of which it is subsequently shown,
that all these visible things which we all [[know]], were made and arranged
during those "days") may, not incongruously, be understood of this
formless first matter.

what now if another should say that "this same formlessness and
confusedness of matter, was for this [[reason]] first conveyed under the
name of [[heaven]] and [[earth]], because out of it was this visible [[world]] with
all those natures [[nature]] which most manifestly appear in it, which is ofttimes
called by the name of [[heaven]] and [[earth]], created and perfected?" what
again if another say that "invisible and visible [[nature]] is not indeed
inappropriately called [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; and so, that the universal
creation, which [[god]] made in his [[wisdom]], that is, in the beginning, was
comprehended under those two words? notwithstanding, since all things be
made not of the substance of [[god]], but out of nothing (because they are
not the same that [[god]] is, and there is a mutable [[nature]] in them all,
whether they abide, as doth the eternal house of [[god]], or be changed, as
the [[soul]] and [[body]] of [[man]] are): therefore the [[common]] matter of all things
visible and invisible (as yet unformed though capable of form), out of
which was to be created both [[heaven]] and [[earth]] (i.e., the invisible and
visible creature when formed), was entitled by the same names given to
the [[earth]] invisible and without form and the darkness upon the deep, but
with this distinction, that by the [[earth]] invisible and without form is
understood corporeal matter, antecedent to its being qualified by any
form; and by the darkness upon the deep, [[spiritual]] matter, before it
underwent any restraint of its unlimited fluidness, or received any
light from [[wisdom]]?"

it yet remains for a [[man]] to say, if he will, that "the already perfected
and formed natures [[nature]], visible and invisible, are not signified under the
name of [[heaven]] and [[earth]], when we [[read]], in the beginning [[god]] made heaven
and [[earth]], but that the yet unformed commencement of things, the stuff
apt to receive form and making, was called by these names, because
therein were confusedly contained, not as yet distinguished by their
qualities and forms, all those things which being now digested into
order, are called [[heaven]] and [[earth]], the one being the [[spiritual]], the
other the corporeal, creation."

all which things being heard and well considered, i will not strive
about words: for that is profitable to nothing, but the subversion of
the hearers. but the [[law]] is [[good]] to edify, if a [[man]] use it lawfully: for
that the end of it is charity, out of a pure [[heart]] and [[good]] [[conscience]],
and [[faith]] unfeigned. and well did our master [[know]], upon which two
commandments he hung all the [[law]] and the prophets [[prophet]]. and what doth it
prejudice me, o my [[god]], thou [[light]] of my [[eyes]] in secret, zealously
confessing these things, since divers things may be understood under
these words which yet are all true,--what, i say, doth it prejudice me,
if i [[think]] otherwise than another thinketh the writer [[thought]]? all we
readers verily strive to trace out and to [[understand]] his meaning whom we
read; and seeing we [[believe]] him to speak truly, we dare not imagine
him to have said any thing, which ourselves either [[know]] or [[think]] to
be false. while every [[man]] endeavours then to [[understand]] in the holy
scriptures, the same as the writer understood, what hurt is it, if a man
understand what thou, the [[light]] of all true-speaking minds [[mind]], dost show
him to be true, although he whom he reads, understood not this, seeing
he also understood a [[truth]], though not this [[truth]]?

for true it is, o [[lord]], that thou madest [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; and it is
true too, that the beginning is thy [[wisdom]], in which thou createst all:
and true again, that this visible [[world]] hath for its greater part
the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]], which briefly comprise all made and created
natures. and true too, that whatsoever is mutable, gives us to
understand a [[certain]] want of form, whereby it receiveth a form, or is
changed, or turned. it is true, that that is [[subject]] to no times [[time]], which
so cleaveth to the unchangeable form, as though [[subject]] to [[change]],
never to be changed. it is true, that that formlessness which is almost
nothing, cannot be [[subject]] to the alteration of times [[time]]. it is true, that
that whereof a thing is made, may by a [[certain]] mode of [[speech]], be called
by the name of the thing made of it; whence that formlessness, whereof
heaven and [[earth]] were made, might be called [[heaven]] and [[earth]]. it is
true, that of things having form, there is not any nearer to having
no form, than the [[earth]] and the deep. it is true, that not only every
created and formed thing, but whatsoever is capable of being created and
formed, thou madest, of whom are all things. it is true, that whatsoever
is formed out of that which had no form, was unformed before it was
formed.

out of these truths [[truth]], of which they [[doubt]] not whose inward eye thou hast
enabled to see such things, and who unshakenly [[believe]] thy servant moses
to have spoken in the spirit of [[truth]];--of all these then, he taketh
one, who saith, in the beginning [[god]] made the [[heaven]] and the [[earth]]; that
is, "in his word coeternal with himself, [[god]] made the intelligible and
the sensible, or the [[spiritual]] and the corporeal creature." he another,
that saith, in the beginning [[god]] made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; that is, "in
his word coeternal with himself, did [[god]] make the universal bulk of this
corporeal [[world]], together with all those apparent and known creatures,
which it containeth." he another, that saith, in the beginning [[god]] made
heaven and [[earth]]; that is, "in his word coeternal with himself, did
god make the formless matter of creatures [[spiritual]] and corporeal." he
another, that saith, in the beginning [[god]] created [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; that
is, "in his word coeternal with himself, did [[god]] create the formless
matter of the creature corporeal, wherein [[heaven]] and [[earth]] lay as yet
confused, which, being now distinguished and formed, we at this day see
in the bulk of this [[world]]." he another, who saith, in the beginning god
made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; that is, "in the very beginning of creating and
working, did [[god]] make that formless matter, confusedly containing in
itself both [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; out of which, being formed, do they now
stand out, and are apparent, with all that is in them."

and with regard to the understanding of the words following, out of all
those truths [[truth]], he chooses one to himself, who saith, but the [[earth]] was
invisible, and without form, and darkness was upon the deep; that is,
"that corporeal thing that [[god]] made, was as yet a formless matter of
corporeal things, without order, without [[light]]." another he who says,
the [[earth]] was invisible and without form, and darkness was upon the
deep; that is, "this all, which is called [[heaven]] and [[earth]], was still
a formless and darksome matter, of which the corporeal [[heaven]] and the
corporeal [[earth]] were to be made, with all things in them, which are
known to our corporeal senses." another he who says, the [[earth]] was
invisible and without form, and darkness was upon the deep; that is,
"this all, which is called [[heaven]] and [[earth]], was still a formless and
a darksome matter; out of which was to be made, both that intelligible
heaven, otherwhere called the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]], and the [[earth]], that is,
the whole corporeal [[nature]], under which name is comprised this corporeal
heaven also; in a word, out of which every visible and invisible
creature was to be created." another he who says, the [[earth]] was
invisible and without form, and darkness was upon the deep, "the
scripture did not call that formlessness by the name of [[heaven]] and
earth; but that formlessness, saith he, already was, which he called the
earth invisible without form, and darkness upon the deep; of which
he had before said, that [[god]] had made [[heaven]] and [[earth]], namely, the
spiritual and corporeal creature." another he who says, the [[earth]] was
invisible and without form, and darkness was upon the deep; that is,
"there already was a [[certain]] formless matter, of which the scripture
said before, that [[god]] made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; namely, the whole corporeal
bulk of the [[world]], divided into two [[great]] parts, upper and lower, with
all the [[common]] and known creatures in them."

for should any attempt to dispute against these two [[last]] opinions [[opinion]], thus,
"if you will not allow, that this formlessness of matter seems to be
called by the name of [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; ergo, there was something which
god had not made, out of which to make [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; for neither
hath [[scripture]] told us, that [[god]] made this matter, unless we understand
it to be signified by the name of [[heaven]] and [[earth]], or of [[earth]] alone,
when it is said, in the beginning [[god]] made the [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; that so
in what follows, and the [[earth]] was invisible and without form (although
it pleased him so to call the formless matter), we are to understand
no other matter, but that which [[god]] made, whereof is written above, god
made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]." the maintainers of either of those two latter
opinions will, upon hearing this, return for [[answer]], "we do not deny
this formless matter to be indeed created by [[god]], that [[god]] of whom are
all things, very [[good]]; for as we affirm that to be a greater [[good]], which
is created and formed, so we confess that to be a lesser [[good]] which is
made capable of creation and form, yet still [[good]]. we say however that
scripture hath not set down, that [[god]] made this formlessness, as also it
hath not many others; as the cherubim, and seraphim, and those which
the apostle distinctly speaks of, thrones, dominions, principalities,
powers. all which that [[god]] made, is most apparent. or if in that which
is said, he made [[heaven]] and [[earth]], all things be comprehended, what
shall we say of the waters, upon which the spirit of [[god]] moved? for if
they be comprised in this word [[earth]]; how then can formless matter be
meant in that name of [[earth]], when we see the waters so beautiful? or
if it be so taken; why then is it written, that out of the same
formlessness, the firmament was made, and called [[heaven]]; and that the
waters were made, is not written? for the waters remain not formless and
invisible, seeing we behold them flowing in so comely a manner. but if
they then received that [[beauty]], when [[god]] said, let the waters under the
firmament be gathered together, that so the gathering together be itself
the forming of them; what will be said as to those waters above the
firmament? seeing neither if formless would they have been worthy of so
honourable a seat, nor is it written, by what word they were formed. if
then genesis is silent as to god's making of any thing, which yet
that [[god]] did make neither sound [[faith]] nor well-grounded understanding
doubteth, nor again will any sober teaching dare to affirm these
waters to be coeternal with [[god]], on the ground that we find them to be
mentioned in the hook of genesis, but when they were created, we do
not find; why (seeing [[truth]] teaches [[teach]] us) should we not [[understand]] that
formless matter (which this [[scripture]] calls the [[earth]] invisible and
without form, and darksome deep) to have been created of [[god]] out of
nothing, and therefore not to be coeternal to him; notwithstanding this
history hath omitted to show when it was created?"

these things then being heard and perceived, according to the weakness
of my capacity (which i confess unto thee, o [[lord]], that knowest it), two
sorts of disagreements i see may arise, when a thing is in words related
by true reporters; one, concerning the [[truth]] of the things, the other,
concerning the meaning of the relater. for we enquire one way about
the making of the creature, what is true; another way, what [[moses]],
that excellent minister of thy [[faith]], would have his reader and hearer
understand by those words. for the first sort, away with all those
who imagine themselves to [[know]] as a [[truth]], what is false; and for this
other, away with all them too, which imagine [[moses]] to have written
things that be false. but let me be [[united]] in thee, o [[lord]], with those
and delight myself in thee, with them that feed on thy [[truth]], in the
largeness of charity, and let us approach together unto the words of
thy [[book]], and seek in them for thy meaning, through the meaning of thy
servant, by whose pen thou hast dispensed them.

but which of us shall, among those so many truths [[truth]], which occur to
enquirers in those words, as they are differently understood, so
discover that one meaning, as to affirm, "this [[moses]] [[thought]]," and "this
would he have understood in that history"; with the same confidence
as he would, "this is true," whether [[moses]] [[thought]] this or that? for
behold, o my [[god]], i thy servant, who have in this [[book]] vowed a sacrifice
of [[confession]] unto thee, and [[pray]], that by thy [[mercy]] i may [[pay]] my vows
unto thee, can i, with the same confidence wherewith i affirm, that in
thy incommutable [[world]] thou createdst all things visible and invisible,
affirm also, that [[moses]] meant no other than this, when he wrote, in the
beginning [[god]] made [[heaven]] and [[earth]]? no. because i see not in his [[mind]],
that he [[thought]] of this when he wrote these things, as i do see it
in thy [[truth]] to be [[certain]]. for he might have his thoughts [[thought]] upon god's
commencement of creating, when he said in the beginning; and by heaven
and [[earth]], in this place he might intend no formed and perfected nature
whether [[spiritual]] or corporeal, but both of them inchoate and as yet
formless. for i perceive, that whichsoever of the two had been said, it
might have been truly said; but which of the two he [[thought]] of in these
words, i do not so perceive. although, whether it were either of these,
or any sense beside (that i have not here mentioned), which this so
great [[man]] saw in his [[mind]], when he uttered these words, i [[doubt]] not but
that he saw it truly, and expressed it aptly.

let no [[man]] harass me then, by saying, [[moses]] [[thought]] not as you say, but
as i say: for if he should ask me, "how [[know]] you that [[moses]] [[thought]] that
which you infer out of his words?" i ought to take it in [[good]] part, and
would [[answer]] perchance as i have above, or something more at large, if
he were unyielding. but when he saith, "moses meant not what you say,
but what i say," yet denieth not that what each of us say, may both be
true, o my [[god]], [[life]] of the [[poor]], in whose bosom is no contradiction,
pour down a softening dew into my [[heart]], that i may patiently bear with
such as say this to me, not because they have a [[divine]] spirit, and have
seen in the [[heart]] of thy servant what they speak, but because they be
proud; not knowing moses' [[opinion]], but loving their own, not because it
is [[truth]], but because it is theirs. otherwise they would equally love
another true [[opinion]], as i [[love]] what they say, when they say true: not
because it is theirs, but because it is true; and on that very ground
not theirs because it is true. but if they therefore [[love]] it, because
it is true, then is it both theirs, and mine; as being in [[common]] to all
lovers of [[truth]]. but whereas they contend that [[moses]] did not mean what
i say, but what they say, this i like not, [[love]] not: for though it
were so, yet that their rashness belongs not to [[knowledge]], but to
overboldness, and not insight but vanity was its parent. and therefore,
o [[lord]], are thy judgements terrible; seeing thy [[truth]] is neither mine,
nor his, nor another's; but belonging to us all, whom thou callest
publicly to partake of it, warning us terribly, not to account
it private to ourselves, lest we be deprived of it. for whosoever
challenges that as proper to himself, which thou propoundest to all to
enjoy, and would have that his own which belongs to all, is driven from
what is in [[common]] to his own; that is, from [[truth]], to a [[lie]]. for he that
speaketh a [[lie]], speaketh it of his own.

hearken, o [[god]], thou [[best]] [[judge]]; [[truth]] itself, hearken to what i shall
say to this gainsayer, hearken, for before thee do i speak, and before
my brethren [[brother]], who employ thy [[law]] lawfully, to the end of charity:
hearken and behold, if it please thee, what i shall say to him. for this
brotherly and peaceful word do i return unto him: "if we both see that
to be true that thou sayest, and both see that to be true that i say,
where, i [[pray]] thee, do we see it? neither i in thee, nor thou in me; but
both in the unchangeable [[truth]] itself, which is above our souls [[soul]]." seeing
then we strive not about the very [[light]] of the [[lord]] [[god]], why strive
we about the thoughts [[thought]] of our neighbour which we cannot so see, as the
unchangeable [[truth]] is seen: for that, if [[moses]] himself had appeared to
us and said, "this i meant"; neither so should we see it, but should
believe it. let us not then be puffed up for one against another, above
that which is written: let us [[love]] the [[lord]] our [[god]] with all our [[heart]],
with all our [[soul]], and with all our [[mind]]: and our neighbour as ourself.
with a view to which two precepts of charity, unless we [[believe]] that
moses meant, whatsoever in those books [[book]] he did mean, we shall make god
a liar, imagining otherwise of our fellow servant's [[mind]], than he hath
taught us. behold now, how foolish it is, in such abundance of most
true meanings, as may be extracted out of those words, rashly to affirm,
which of them [[moses]] principally meant; and with pernicious contentions
to offend charity itself, for whose sake he spake every thing, whose
words we go about to expound.

and yet i, o my [[god]], thou lifter up of my [[humility]], and rest of my
labour, who hearest my confessions, and forgivest my sins [[sin]]: seeing thou
commandest me to [[love]] my neighbour as myself, i cannot [[believe]] that thou
gavest a less gift unto [[moses]] thy faithful servant, than i would wish
or [[desire]] thee to have given me, had i been born in the [[time]] he was, and
hadst thou set me in that office, that by the service of my [[heart]] and
tongue those books [[book]] might be dispensed, which for so long after were to
profit all nations, and through the whole [[world]] from such an eminence of
authority, were to surmount all sayings of false and proud teachings. i
should have [[desired]] verily, had i then been [[moses]] (for we all come from
the same lump, and what is [[man]], saving that thou art [[arts]] mindful of him?),
i would then, had i been then what he was, and been enjoined by thee to
write the [[book]] of genesis, have [[desired]] such a [[power]] of expression and
such a style to be given me, that neither they who cannot yet understand
how [[god]] created, might reject the sayings, as beyond their capacity; and
they who had attained thereto, might find what true [[opinion]] soever they
had by [[thought]] arrived at, not passed over in those few words of
that thy servant: and should another [[man]] by the [[light]] of [[truth]] have
discovered another, neither should that fail of being discoverable in
those same words.

for as a fountain within a narrow compass, is more plentiful, and
supplies a tide for more streams over larger spaces, than any one of
those streams, which, after a wide interval, is derived from the same
fountain; so the relation of that dispenser of thine, which was to
benefit many who were to discourse thereon, does out of a narrow
scantling of [[language]], overflow into streams of clearest [[truth]], whence
every [[man]] may draw out for himself such [[truth]] as he can upon these
subjects, one, one [[truth]], another, another, by larger circumlocutions of
discourse. for some, when they [[read]], or hear these words, conceive that
god like a [[man]] or some mass endued with unbounded [[power]], by some new
and sudden resolution, did, exterior to itself, as it were at a certain
distance, create [[heaven]] and [[earth]], two [[great]] bodies [[body]] above and below,
wherein all things were to be contained. and when they hear, [[god]] said,
let it be made, and it was made; they conceive of words begun and ended,
sounding in [[time]], and passing away; after whose departure, that came
into being, which was commanded so to do; and whatever of the like sort,
men's acquaintance with the material [[world]] would suggest. in whom, being
yet little ones and carnal, while their weakness is by this humble
kind of [[speech]], carried on, as in a mother's bosom, their [[faith]] is
wholesomely built up, whereby they hold assured, that [[god]] made all
natures, which in admirable variety their eye beholdeth around. which
words, if any despising, as too simple, with a proud weakness, shall
stretch himself beyond the guardian nest; he will, alas, fall miserably.
have [[pity]], o [[lord]] [[god]], lest they who go by the way trample on the
unfledged bird, and send thine angel to replace it into the nest, that
it may [[live]], till it can fly.

but others, unto whom these words are no longer a nest, but deep shady
fruit-bowers, see the fruits concealed therein, fly joyously around,
and with cheerful notes seek out, and pluck them. for reading or hearing
these words, they see that all times [[time]] [[past]] and to come, are surpassed by
thy eternal and stable abiding; and yet that there is no creature formed
in [[time]], not of thy making. whose will, because it is the same that thou
art, thou madest all things, not by any [[change]] of will, nor by a will,
which before was not, and that these things were not out of thyself, in
thine own likeness, which is the form of all things; but out of nothing,
a formless unlikeness, which should be formed by thy likeness (recurring
to thy unity, according to their appointed capacity, so far as is given
to each thing in his kind), and might all be made very [[good]]; whether
they abide around thee, or being in gradation removed in [[time]] and place,
made or undergo the beautiful variations of the [[universe]]. these things
they see, and rejoice, in the little [[degree]] they here may, in the light
of thy [[truth]].

another bends his [[mind]] on that which is said, in the beginning [[god]] made
heaven and [[earth]]; and beholdeth therein [[wisdom]], the beginning because
it also speaketh unto us. another likewise bends his [[mind]] on the same
words, and by beginning understands the commencement of things created;
in the beginning he made, as if it were said, he at first made. and
among them that [[understand]] in the beginning to mean, "in thy [[wisdom]] thou
createdst [[heaven]] and [[earth]]," one believes [[belief]] the matter out of which the
heaven and [[earth]] were to be created, to be there called [[heaven]] and
earth; another, natures [[nature]] already formed and distinguished; another, one
formed [[nature]], and that a [[spiritual]], under the name [[heaven]], the other
formless, a corporeal matter, under the name [[earth]]. they again who by
the names [[heaven]] and [[earth]], [[understand]] matter as yet formless, out of
which [[heaven]] and [[earth]] were to be formed, neither do they [[understand]] it
in one way; but the one, that matter out of which both the intelligible
and the sensible creature were to be perfected; another, that only, out
of which this sensible corporeal mass was to be made, containing in
its vast bosom these visible and ordinary natures [[nature]]. neither do they, who
believe the creatures already ordered and arranged, to be in this place
called [[heaven]] and [[earth]], [[understand]] the same; but the one, both the
invisible and visible, the other, the visible only, in which we behold
this lightsome [[heaven]], and darksome [[earth]], with the things in them
contained.

but he that no otherwise understands in the beginning he made, than if
it were said, at first he made, can only truly [[understand]] [[heaven]] and
earth of the matter of [[heaven]] and [[earth]], that is, of the universal
intelligible and corporeal creation. for if he would [[understand]] thereby
the [[universe]], as already formed, it may be rightly demanded of him, "if
god made this first, what made he afterwards?" and after the [[universe]],
he will find nothing; whereupon must he against his will hear another
question; "how did [[god]] make this first, if nothing after?" but when
he says, [[god]] made matter first formless, then formed, there is no
absurdity, if he be but qualified to discern, what precedes by eternity,
what by [[time]], what by [[choice]], and what in original. by eternity, as
god is before all things; by [[time]], as the flower before the fruit; by
choice, as the fruit before the flower; by original, as the sound before
the tune. of these four, the first and [[last]] mentioned, are with extreme
difficulty understood, the two middle, easily. for a rare and too lofty
a vision is it, to behold thy eternity, o [[lord]], unchangeably making
things changeable; and thereby before them. and who, again, is of
so sharp-sighted understanding, as to be able without [[great]] pains [[pain]] to
discern, how the sound is therefore before the tune; because a tune is
a formed sound; and a thing not formed, may [[exist]]; whereas that which
existeth not, cannot be formed. thus is the matter before the thing
made; not because it maketh it, seeing itself is rather made; nor is it
before by interval of [[time]]; for we do not first in [[time]] utter formless
sounds without singing, and subsequently adapt or [[fashion]] them into
the form of a chant, as wood or silver, whereof a chest or vessel is
fashioned. for such materials do by [[time]] also precede the forms of the
things made of them, but in singing it is not so; for when it is sung,
its sound is heard; for there is not first a formless sound, which is
afterwards formed into a chant. for each sound, so soon as made, passeth
away, nor canst thou find ought to recall and by art [[arts]] to compose. so
then the chant is concentrated in its sound, which sound of his is his
matter. and this indeed is formed, that it may be a tune; and therefore
(as i said) the matter of the sound is before the form of the tune; not
before, through any [[power]] it hath to make it a tune; for a sound is no
way the workmaster of the tune; but is something corporeal, subjected to
the [[soul]] which singeth, whereof to make a tune. nor is it first in [[time]];
for it is given forth together with the tune; nor first in [[choice]], for
a sound is not [[better]] than a tune, a tune being not only a sound, but
a beautiful sound. but it is first in original, because a tune receives
not form to become a sound, but a sound receives a form to become a
tune. by this [[example]], let him that is able, [[understand]] how the matter
of things was first made, and called [[heaven]] and [[earth]], because heaven
and [[earth]] were made out of it. yet was it not made first in [[time]];
because the forms of things give rise to [[time]]; but that was without
form, but now is, in [[time]], an object of sense together with its form.
and yet nothing can be related of that matter, but as though prior in
time, whereas in value it is [[last]] (because things formed are superior
to things without form) and is preceded by the eternity of the creator:
that so there might be out of nothing, whereof somewhat might be
created.

in this [[diversity]] of the true opinions [[opinion]], let [[truth]] herself produce
concord. and our [[god]] have [[mercy]] upon us, that we may use the law
lawfully, the end of the commandment, pure charity. by this if man
demands of me, "which of these was the meaning of thy servant moses";
this were not the [[language]] of my confessions, should i not confess unto
thee, "i [[know]] not"; and yet i [[know]] that those senses are true, those
carnal ones excepted, of which i have spoken what seemed necessary. and
even those hopeful little ones who so [[think]], have this benefit, that the
words of thy [[book]] affright them not, delivering high things lowlily,
and with few words a copious meaning. and all we who, i confess, see and
express the [[truth]] delivered in those words, let us [[love]] one another, and
jointly [[love]] thee our [[god]], the fountain of [[truth]], if we are athirst for
it, and not for vanities; yea, let us so [[honour]] this thy servant, the
dispenser of this [[scripture]], full of thy spirit, as to [[believe]] that,
when by thy revelation he wrote these things, he intended that, which
among them chiefly excels both for [[light]] of [[truth]], and fruitfulness of
profit.

so when one says, "moses meant as i do"; and another, "nay, but as i
do," i suppose that i speak more reverently, "why not rather as both,
if both be true?" and if there be a third, or a fourth, yea if any other
seeth any other [[truth]] in those words, why may not he be believed to
have seen all these, through whom the one [[god]] hath tempered the holy
scriptures to the senses of many, who should see therein things true but
divers? for i certainly (and fearlessly i speak it from my heart), that
were i to indite any thing to have supreme [[authority]], i should prefer
so to write, that whatever [[truth]] any could apprehend on those matters,
might be conveyed in my words, rather than set down my own meaning so
clearly as to exclude the rest, which not being false, could not offend
me. i will not therefore, o my [[god]], be so rash, as not to [[believe]], that
thou vouchsafedst as much to that [[great]] [[man]]. he without [[doubt]], when he
wrote those words, perceived and [[thought]] on what [[truth]] soever we have
been able to find, yea and whatsoever we have not been able, nor yet
are, but which may be found in them.

lastly, o [[lord]], who art [[arts]] [[god]] and not flesh and [[blood]], if [[man]] did see
less, could any thing be concealed from thy [[good]] spirit (who shall lead
me into the [[land]] of uprightness), which thou thyself by those words wert
about to reveal to readers in times [[time]] to come, though he through whom
they were spoken, perhaps among many true meanings, [[thought]] on some one?
which if so it be, let that which he [[thought]] on be of all the highest.
but to us, o [[lord]], do thou, either reveal that same, or any other true
one which thou pleasest; that so, whether thou discoverest the same to
us, as to that thy servant, or some other by [[occasion]] of those words,
yet thou mayest feed us, not error [[deceive]] us. behold, o [[lord]] my [[god]],
how much we have written upon a few words, how much i beseech thee! what
strength of ours, yea what ages [[age]] would suffice for all thy books [[book]] in this
manner? permit me then in these more briefly to confess unto thee, and
to choose some one true, [[certain]], and [[good]] sense that thou shalt inspire
me, although many should occur, where many may occur; this being the law
my [[confession]], that if i should say that which thy minister intended,
that is [[right]] and [[best]]; for this should i endeavour, which if i should
not attain, yet i should say that, which thy [[truth]] willed by his words
to tell me, which revealed also unto him, what it willed.




book xiii


i call upon thee, o my [[god]], my [[mercy]], who createdst me, and forgottest
not me, forgetting thee. i call thee into my [[soul]] which, by the longing
thyself inspirest into her, thou preparest for thee. forsake me not now
calling upon thee, whom thou preventedst before i called, and urgedst me
with much variety of repeated calls, that i would hear thee from afar,
and be converted, and call upon thee, that calledst after me; for thou,
lord, blottedst out all my [[evil]] deservings, so as not to repay into my
hands, wherewith i fell from thee; and thou hast prevented all my well
deservings, so as to repay the [[work]] of thy hands wherewith thou madest
me; because before i was, thou wert; nor was i any thing, to which
thou mightest grant to be; and yet behold, i am, out of thy goodness,
preventing all this which thou hast made me, and whereof thou hast made
me. for neither hadst thou need of me, nor am i any such [[good]], as to be
helpful unto thee, my [[lord]] and [[god]]; not in serving thee, as though thou
wouldest tire in working; or lest thy [[power]] might be less, if lacking
my service: nor cultivating thy service, as a [[land]], that must remain
uncultivated, unless i cultivated thee: but serving and worshipping
thee, that i might receive a well-being from thee, from whom it comes,
that i have a being capable of well-being.

for of the fulness of thy goodness, doth thy creature subsist, that so
a [[good]], which could no ways [[profit]] thee, nor was of thee (lest so it
should be [[equal]] to thee), might yet be since it could be made of thee.
for what did [[heaven]] and [[earth]], which thou madest in the beginning,
deserve of thee? let those [[spiritual]] and corporeal natures [[nature]] which thou
madest in thy [[wisdom]], say wherein they deserved of thee, to depend
thereon (even in that their several inchoate and formless [[state]], whether
spiritual or corporeal, ready to fall away into an immoderate liberty
and far-distant unlikeliness unto thee;--the [[spiritual]], though without
form, superior to the corporeal though formed, and the corporeal though
without form, [[better]] than were it altogether nothing), and so to depend
upon thy word, as formless, unless by the same word they were brought
back to thy unity, indued with form and from thee the one sovereign
good were made all very [[good]]. how did they deserve of thee, to be even
without form, since they had not been even this, but from thee?

how did corporeal matter deserve of thee, to be even invisible and
without form? seeing it were not even this, but that thou madest it, and
therefore because it was not, could not deserve of thee to be made. or
how could the inchoate [[spiritual]] creature deserve of thee, even to ebb
and flow darksomely like the deep,--unlike thee, unless it had been
by the same word turned to that, by whom it was created, and by him so
enlightened, become [[light]]; though not equally, yet conformably to that
form which is [[equal]] unto thee? for as in a [[body]], to be, is not one with
being beautiful, else could it not be deformed; so likewise to a created
spirit to [[live]], is not one with living wisely; else should it be wise
unchangeably. but [[good]] it is for it always to hold fast to thee; lest
what [[light]] it hath obtained by turning to thee, it lose by turning
from thee, and relapse into [[life]] resembling the darksome deep. for we
ourselves also, who as to the [[soul]] are a [[spiritual]] creature, turned away
from thee our [[light]], were in that [[life]] sometimes darkness; and still
labour amidst the relics of our darkness, until in thy only one we
become thy [[righteousness]], like the mountains of [[god]]. for we have been
thy judgments [[judgment]], which are like the [[great]] deep.

that which thou saidst in the beginning of the creation, let there be
light, and there was [[light]]; i do, not unsuitably, [[understand]] of the
spiritual creature: because there was already a sort of [[life]], which thou
mightest illuminate. but as it had no claim on thee for a [[life]], which
could be enlightened, so neither now that it was, had it any, to be
enlightened. for neither could its formless estate be pleasing unto
thee, unless it became [[light]], and that not by existing simply, but by
beholding the illuminating [[light]], and cleaving to it; so that, that it
lived, and lived happily, it owes to nothing but thy grace, being turned
by a [[better]] [[change]] unto that which cannot be changed into worse or
better; which thou alone art [[arts]], because thou alone simply art [[arts]]; unto
thee it being not one thing to [[live]], another to [[live]] blessedly, seeing
thyself art [[arts]] thine own blessedness.

what then could be wanting unto thy [[good]], which thou thyself art [[arts]],
although these things had either never been, or remained without form;
which thou madest, not out of any want, but out of the fulness of thy
goodness, restraining them and converting them to form, not as though
thy joy were fulfilled by them? for to thee being [[perfect]], is their
imperfection displeasing, and hence were they perfected by thee, and
please thee; not as wert thou imperfect, and by their perfecting wert
also to be perfected. for thy [[good]] spirit indeed was borne over the
waters, not borne up by them, as if he rested upon them. for those, on
whom thy [[good]] spirit is said to rest, he causes to rest in himself. but
thy incorruptible and unchangeable will, in itself all-sufficient for
itself, was borne upon that [[life]] which thou hadst created; to which,
living is not one with [[happy]] living, seeing it liveth also, ebbing and
flowing in its own darkness: for which it remaineth to be converted unto
him, by whom it was made, and to [[live]] more and more by the fountain
of [[life]], and in his [[light]] to see [[light]], and to be perfected, and
enlightened, and beautified.

lo, now the trinity appears unto me in a glass darkly, which is thou my
god, because thou, o [[father]], in him who is the beginning of our [[wisdom]],
which is thy [[wisdom]], born of thyself, [[equal]] unto thee and coeternal,
that is, in thy [[son]], createdst [[heaven]] and [[earth]]. much now have we said
of the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]], and of the [[earth]] invisible and without form,
and of the darksome deep, in reference to the wandering instability of
its [[spiritual]] deformity, unless it had been converted unto him, from
whom it had its then [[degree]] of [[life]], and by his enlightening became a
beauteous [[life]], and the [[heaven]] of that [[heaven]], which was afterwards
set between water and water. and under the name of [[god]], i now held the
father, who made these things, and under the name of beginning, the [[son]],
in whom he made these things; and believing, as i did, my [[god]] as the
trinity, i searched further in his holy words, and lo, thy spirit moved
upon the waters. behold the trinity, my [[god]], [[father]], and [[son]], and holy
ghost, creator of all creation.

but what was the cause, o true-speaking [[light]]?--unto thee lift i up my
heart, let it not [[teach]] me vanities, dispel its darkness; and tell me, i
beseech thee, by our [[mother]] charity, tell me the [[reason]], i beseech thee,
why after the mention of [[heaven]], and of the [[earth]] invisible and without
form, and darkness upon the deep, thy [[scripture]] should then at length
mention thy spirit? was it because it was meet that the [[knowledge]] of him
should be conveyed, as being "borne above"; and this could not be
said, unless that were first mentioned, over which thy spirit may
be understood to have been borne. for neither was he borne above the
father, nor the [[son]], nor could he rightly be said to be borne above, if
he were borne over nothing. first then was that to be spoken of, over
which he might be borne; and then he, whom it was meet not otherwise to
be spoken of than as being borne. but wherefore was it not meet that
the [[knowledge]] of him should be conveyed otherwise, than as being borne
above?

hence let him that is able, [[follow]] with his understanding thy apostle,
where he thus speaks, because thy [[love]] is shed abroad in our hearts [[heart]] by
the holy ghost which is given unto us: and where concerning spiritual
gifts, he teacheth and showeth unto us a more excellent way of charity;
and where he bows his knee unto thee for us, that we may [[know]] the
supereminent [[knowledge]] of the [[love]] of [[christ]]. and therefore from the
beginning, was he borne supereminent above the waters. to whom shall i
speak this? how speak of the weight of [[evil]] desires [[desire]], downwards to the
steep abyss; and how charity raises up again by thy spirit which was
borne above the waters? to whom shall i speak it? how speak it? for it
is not in space that we are merged and emerge. what can be more, and yet
what less like? they be affections, they be loves [[love]]; the uncleanness
of our spirit flowing away downwards with the [[love]] of cares [[care]], and the
holiness of thine raising us upward by [[love]] of unanxious repose; that
we may lift our hearts [[heart]] unto thee, where thy spirit is borne above the
waters; and come to that supereminent repose, when our [[soul]] shall have
passed through the waters which yield no support.

angels fell away, man's [[man]] [[soul]] fell away, and thereby pointed the abyss in
that dark depth, ready for the whole [[spiritual]] creation, hadst not thou
said from the beginning, let there be [[light]], and there had been [[light]],
and every [[obedient]] [[intelligence]] of thy heavenly [[city]] had cleaved to
thee, and rested in thy spirit, which is borne unchangeably over every
thing changeable. otherwise, had even the [[heaven]] of heavens [[heaven]] been in
itself a darksome deep; but now it is [[light]] in the [[lord]]. for even in
that miserable restlessness of the spirits, who fell away and discovered
their own darkness, when bared of the clothing of thy [[light]], dost thou
sufficiently reveal how [[noble]] thou madest the reasonable creature; to
which nothing will suffice to yield a [[happy]] rest, less than thee; and so
not even herself. for thou, o our [[god]], shalt lighten our darkness: from
thee riseth our garment of [[light]]; and then shall our darkness be as
the noon day. give thyself unto me, o my [[god]], restore thyself unto me:
behold i [[love]], and if it be too little, i would [[love]] more strongly. i
cannot measure so as to [[know]], how much [[love]] there yet lacketh to me, ere
my [[life]] may run into thy embracements, nor turn away, until it be hidden
in the hidden place of thy presence. this only i [[know]], that woe is
me except in thee: not only without but within myself also; and all
abundance, which is not my [[god]], is emptiness to me.

but was not either the [[father]], or the [[son]], borne above the waters? if
this means, in space, like a [[body]], then neither was the holy spirit;
but if the unchangeable supereminence of divinity above all things
changeable, then were both [[father]], and [[son]], and holy ghost borne upon
the waters. why then is this said of thy spirit only, why is it said
only of him? as if he had been in place, who is not in place, of whom
only it is written, that he is thy gift? in thy gift we rest; there we
enjoy thee. our rest is our place. [[love]] lifts us up thither, and thy
good spirit lifts up our lowliness from the gates of [[death]]. in thy good
pleasure is our [[peace]]. the [[body]] by its own weight strives towards its
own place. weight makes not downward only, but to his own place. fire
tends upward, a stone downward. they are urged by their own weight,
they seek their own places. [[oil]] poured below water, is raised above the
water; water poured upon [[oil]], sinks below the [[oil]]. they are urged by
their own weights to seek their own places. when out of their order,
they are restless; restored to order, they are at rest. my weight, is my
love; thereby am i borne, whithersoever i am borne. we are inflamed, by
thy gift we are kindled; and are carried upwards; we glow inwardly, and
go forwards. we ascend thy ways that be in our [[heart]], and sing a [[song]] of
degrees; we glow inwardly with thy [[fire]], with thy [[good]] [[fire]], and we go;
because we go upwards to the [[peace]] of [[jerusalem]]: for gladdened was i in
those who said unto me, we will go up to the house of the [[lord]]. there
hath thy [[good]] [[pleasure]] placed us, that we may [[desire]] nothing else, but
to abide there for ever.

blessed creature, which being itself other than thou, has known no
other condition, than that, so soon as it was made, it was, without
any interval, by thy gift, which is borne above every thing changeable,
borne aloft by that calling whereby thou saidst, let there be [[light]], and
there was [[light]]. whereas in us this took place at different times [[time]], in
that we were darkness, and are made [[light]]: but of that is only said,
what it would have been, had it not been enlightened. and, this is so
spoken, as if it had been unsettled and darksome before; that so the
cause whereby it was made otherwise, might appear, namely, that being
turned to the [[light]] unfailing it became [[light]]. whoso can, let him
understand this; let him ask of thee. why should he trouble me, as if i
could enlighten any [[man]] that cometh into this [[world]]?

which of us comprehendeth the almighty trinity? and yet which speaks not
of it, if indeed it be it? rare is the [[soul]], which while it speaks of
it, knows [[know]] what it speaks of. and they contend and strive, yet, without
peace, no [[man]] sees that vision. i would that [[men]] would consider these
three, that are in themselves. these three be indeed far other than the
trinity: i do but tell, where they may practise themselves, and there
prove and [[feel]] how far they be. now the three i spake of are, to be,
to [[know]], and to will. for i am, and [[know]], and will: i am knowing and
willing: and i [[know]] myself to be, and to will: and i will to be, and to
know. in these three then, let him discern that can, how inseparable
a [[life]] there is, yea one [[life]], [[mind]], and one essence, yea lastly how
inseparable a distinction there is, and yet a distinction. surely a man
hath it before him; let him look into himself, and see, and tell me. but
when he discovers and can say any thing of these, let him not therefore
think that he has found that which is above these unchangeable, which
is unchangeably, and knows [[know]] unchangeably, and wills unchangeably; and
whether because of these three, there is in [[god]] also a trinity, or
whether all three be in each, so that the three belong to each; or
whether both ways at once, wondrously, simply and yet manifoldly, itself
a bound unto itself within itself, yet unbounded; whereby it is, and is
known unto itself and sufficeth to itself, unchangeably the self-same,
by the abundant greatness of its unity,--who can readily conceive this?
who could any ways express it? who would, any way, pronounce thereon
rashly?

proceed in thy [[confession]], say to the [[lord]] thy [[god]], o my [[faith]], holy,
holy, holy, o [[lord]] my [[god]], in thy name have we been baptised, [[father]],
son, and holy ghost; in thy name do we baptise, [[father]], [[son]], and holy
ghost, because among us also, in his [[christ]] did [[god]] make [[heaven]] and
earth, namely, the [[spiritual]] and carnal [[people]] of his [[church]]. yea and
our [[earth]], before it received the form of doctrine, was invisible and
without form; and we were covered with the darkness of ignorance. for
thou chastenedst [[man]] for [[iniquity]], and thy judgments [[judgment]] were like the great
deep unto him. but because thy spirit was borne above the waters, thy
mercy forsook not our misery, and thou saidst, let there be [[light]],
repent ye, for the [[kingdom]] of [[heaven]] is at hand. repent ye, let there be
light. and because our [[soul]] was troubled within us, we remembered thee,
o [[lord]], from the [[land]] of jordan, and that mountain [[equal]] unto thyself,
but little for our sakes: and our darkness displeased us, we turned unto
thee and there was [[light]]. and, behold, we were sometimes darkness, but
now [[light]] in the [[lord]].

but as yet by [[faith]] and not by sight, for by [[hope]] we are saved; but hope
that is seen, is not [[hope]]. as yet doth deep call unto deep, but now in
the voice of thy water-spouts. as yet doth he that saith, i could not
speak unto you as unto [[spiritual]], but as unto carnal, even he as yet,
doth not [[think]] himself to have apprehended, and forgetteth those things
which are behind, and reacheth forth to those which are before, and
groaneth being burthened, and his [[soul]] thirsteth after the living
god, as the hart after the water-brooks, and saith, when shall i come?
desiring to be clothed upon with his house which is from [[heaven]], and
calleth upon this lower deep, saying, be not conformed to this [[world]],
but be ye transformed by the renewing of your [[mind]]. and, be not children
in understanding, but in malice, be ye [[children]], that in understanding
ye may be [[perfect]]; and o foolish galatians, who hath bewitched you? but
now no longer in his own voice; but in thine who sentest thy spirit from
above; through him who ascended up on high, and set open the flood-gates
of his gifts, that the [[force]] of his streams might make glad the [[city]] of
god. him doth this friend of the bridegroom sigh after, having now the
first-fruits of the spirit laid up with him, yet still groaning within
himself, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of his [[body]];
to him he sighs, a member of the bride; for him he is [[jealous]], as being
a friend of the bridegroom; for him he is [[jealous]], not for himself;
because in the voice of thy water-spouts, not in his own voice, doth he
call to that other depth, over whom being [[jealous]] he feareth, lest as
the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty, so their minds [[mind]] should be
corrupted from the purity that is in our bridegroom thy only [[son]]. o
what a [[light]] of [[beauty]] will that be, when we shall see him as he is,
and those tears be passed away, which have been my meat day and night,
whilst they daily say unto me, where is now thy [[god]]?

behold, i too say, o my [[god]], where art [[arts]] thou? see, where thou art! in
thee i breathe a little, when i pour out my [[soul]] by myself in the voice
of joy and [[praise]], the sound of him that keeps holy-day. and yet again
it is [[sad]], because it relapseth, and becomes a deep, or rather perceives
itself still to be a deep. unto it speaks my [[faith]] which thou hast
kindled to enlighten my feet in the night, why art [[arts]] thou [[sad]], o my [[soul]],
and why dost thou trouble me? [[hope]] in the [[lord]]; his word is a lanthorn
unto thy feet: [[hope]] and endure, until the night, the [[mother]] of the
wicked, until the wrath of the [[lord]], be overpast, whereof we also were
once [[children]], who were sometimes darkness, relics whereof we bear
about us in our [[body]], [[dead]] because of [[sin]]; until the day break, and the
shadows fly away. [[hope]] thou in the [[lord]]; in the morning i shall stand in
thy presence, and contemplate thee: i shall for ever confess unto thee.
in the morning i shall stand in thy presence, and shall see the health
of my countenance, my [[god]], who also shall quicken our mortal bodies [[body]], by
the spirit that dwelleth in us, because he hath in [[mercy]] been borne
over our inner darksome and floating deep: from whom we have in this
pilgrimage received an earnest, that we should now be [[light]]: whilst we
are saved by [[hope]], and are the [[children]] of [[light]], and the [[children]] of
the day, not the [[children]] of the night, nor of the darkness, which yet
sometimes we were. betwixt whom and us, in this uncertainty of human
knowledge, thou only dividest; thou, who provest our hearts [[heart]], and callest
the [[light]], day, and the darkness, night. for who discerneth us, but
thou? and what have we, that we have not received of thee? out of the
same lump vessels are made unto [[honour]], whereof others also are made
unto dishonour.

or who, except thou, our [[god]], made for us that firmament of authority
over us in thy [[divine]] [[scripture]]? as it is said, for [[heaven]] shall be
folded up like a scroll; and now is it stretched over us like a skin.
for thy [[divine]] [[scripture]] is of more eminent [[authority]], since those
mortals by whom thou dispensest it unto us, underwent [[mortality]]. and
thou knowest, [[lord]], thou knowest, how thou with skins didst clothe [[men]],
when they by [[sin]] became mortal. whence thou hast like a skin stretched
out the firmament of thy [[book]], that is, thy harmonizing words, which
by the ministry of mortal [[men]] thou spreadest over us. for by their very
death was that solid firmament of [[authority]], in thy discourses set forth
by them, more eminently extended over all that be under it; which whilst
they lived here, was not so eminently extended. thou hadst not as yet
spread abroad the [[heaven]] like a skin; thou hadst not as yet enlarged in
all directions the [[glory]] of their deaths [[death]].

let us look, o [[lord]], upon the heavens [[heaven]], the [[work]] of thy fingers; clear
from our [[eyes]] that cloud, which thou hast spread under them. there is
thy testimony, which giveth [[wisdom]] unto the little ones: [[perfect]], o my
god, thy [[praise]] out of the mouth of babes and sucklings. for we [[know]] no
other books [[book]], which so [[destroy]] [[pride]], which so [[destroy]] the [[enemy]] and the
defender, who resisteth thy reconciliation by defending his own sins [[sin]]. i
know not, [[lord]], i [[know]] not any other such pure words, which so persuade
me to confess, and make my neck pliant to thy yoke, and invite me to
serve thee for nought. let me [[understand]] them, [[good]] [[father]]: grant this
to me, who am placed under them: because for those placed under them,
hast thou established them.

other waters there be above this firmament, i [[believe]] [[immortal]], and
separated from earthly [[corruption]]. let them [[praise]] thy name, let them
praise thee, the supercelestial [[people]], thine angels, who have no need
to gaze up at this firmament, or by reading to [[know]] of thy word. for
they always behold thy face, and there [[read]] without any syllables in
time, what willeth thy eternal will; they [[read]], they choose, they [[love]].
they are ever reading; and that never passes away which they [[read]]; for
by choosing, and by loving, they [[read]] the very unchangeableness of thy
counsel. their [[book]] is never closed, nor their scroll folded up; seeing
thou thyself art [[arts]] this to them, and art [[arts]] eternally; because thou hast
ordained them above this firmament, which thou hast firmly settled over
the infirmity of the lower [[people]], where they might gaze up and learn
thy [[mercy]], announcing in [[time]] thee who madest times [[time]]. for thy [[mercy]], o
lord, is in the heavens [[heaven]], and thy [[truth]] reacheth unto the clouds. the
clouds pass away, but the [[heaven]] abideth. the preachers of thy word pass
out of this [[life]] into another; but thy [[scripture]] is spread abroad over
the [[people]], even unto the end of the [[world]]. yet [[heaven]] and [[earth]] also
shall pass away, but thy words shall not pass away. because the scroll
shall be rolled together: and the grass over which it was spread, shall
with the goodliness of it pass away; but thy word remaineth for ever,
which now appeareth unto us under the dark image of the clouds, and
through the glass of the heavens [[heaven]], not as it is: because we also, though
the well-beloved of thy [[son]], yet it hath not yet appeared what we
shall be. he looketh through the lattice of our flesh, and he spake us
tenderly, and kindled us, and we ran after his odours. but when he shall
appear, then shall we be like him, for we shall see him as he is. as he
is, [[lord]], will our sight be.

for altogether, as thou art [[arts]], thou only knowest; who art [[arts]] unchangeably,
and knowest unchangeably, and willest unchangeably. and thy essence
knoweth, and willeth unchangeably; and thy [[knowledge]] is, and willeth
unchangeably; and thy will is, and knoweth unchangeably. nor seemeth it
right in thine [[eyes]], that as the unchangeable [[light]] knoweth itself, so
should it be known by the thing enlightened, and changeable. therefore
is my [[soul]] like a [[land]] where no water is, because as it cannot of itself
enlighten itself, so can it not of itself satisfy itself. for so is the
fountain of [[life]] with thee, like as in thy [[light]] we shall see [[light]].

who gathered the embittered together into one [[society]]? for they have all
one end, a temporal and earthly felicity, for attaining whereof they do
all things, though they waver up and down with an innumerable variety of
cares. who, [[lord]], but thou, saidst, let the waters be gathered together
into one place, and let the dry [[land]] appear, which thirsteth after thee?
for the sea also is thine, and thou hast made it, and thy hands prepared
the dry [[land]]. nor is the bitterness of men's wills, but the gathering
together of the waters, called sea; for thou restrainest the wicked
desires of men's souls [[soul]], and settest them their bounds, how far they may
be allowed to pass, that their waves may break one against another: and
thus makest thou it a sea, by the order of thy dominion over all things.

but the souls [[soul]] that thirst after thee, and that appear before thee (being
by other bounds divided from the [[society]] of the sea), thou waterest by
a sweet spring, that the [[earth]] may bring forth her fruit, and thou, lord
god, so commanding, our [[soul]] may bud forth works [[work]] of [[mercy]] according
to their [[kind]], loving our neighbour in the relief of his bodily
necessities, having seed in itself according to its likeness, when from
feeling of our infirmity, we compassionate so as to relieve the needy;
helping them, as we would be helped; if we were in like need; not only
in things easy, as in herb yielding seed, but also in the protection of
our assistance, with our [[best]] [[strength]], like the tree yielding fruit:
that is, well-doing in rescuing him that suffers [[wrong]], from the hand
of the powerful, and giving him the shelter of protection, by the mighty
strength of just [[judgment]].

so, [[lord]], so, i beseech thee, let there spring up, as thou doest, as
thou givest cheerfulness and ability, let [[truth]] spring out of the [[earth]],
and [[righteousness]] look down from [[heaven]], and let there be lights [[light]] in the
firmament. let us break our bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless
poor to our house. let us clothe the naked, and despise not those of our
own flesh. which fruits having sprung out of the [[earth]], see it is [[good]]:
and let our temporary [[light]] break forth; and ourselves, from this lower
fruitfulness of action, arriving at the delightfulness of contemplation,
obtaining the word of [[life]] above, appear like lights [[light]] in the [[world]],
cleaving to the firmament of thy [[scripture]]. for there thou instructest
us, to divide between the things intellectual, and things of sense, as
betwixt the day and the night; or between souls [[soul]], given either to things
intellectual, or things of sense, so that now not thou only in the
secret of thy [[judgment]], as before the firmament was made, dividest
between the [[light]] and the darkness, but thy [[spiritual]] [[children]] also
set and ranked in the same firmament (now that thy grace is laid open
throughout the world), may give [[light]] upon the [[earth]], and divide betwixt
the day and the night, and be for signs of times [[time]], that old things
are passed away, and, behold, all things are become new; and that our
salvation is nearer than when we believed: and that the night is far
spent, and the day is at hand: and that thou wilt [[crown]] thy year with
blessing, sending the labourers of thy goodness into thy harvest, in
sowing whereof, others have laboured, sending also into another field,
whose harvest shall be in the end. thus grantest thou the prayers of him
that asketh, and blessest the years of the just; but thou art [[arts]] the same,
and in thy years which fail not, thou preparest a garner for our passing
years. for thou by an eternal counsel dost in their proper seasons
bestow heavenly blessings upon the [[earth]]. for to one is given by the
spirit the word of [[wisdom]], as it were the lesser [[light]]: to another
faith; to another the gift with the [[light]] of perspicuous [[truth]], as it
were for the [[rule]] of the day. to another the word of [[knowledge]] by the
same spirit, as it were the lesser [[light]]: to another [[faith]]; to another
the gift of healing; to another the working of [[miracles]]; to another
prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds [[kind]] of
tongues. and all these as it were stars. for all these worketh the one
and self-same spirit, dividing to every [[man]] his own as he will; and
causing stars to appear manifestly, to [[profit]] withal. but the word of
knowledge, wherein are contained all sacraments, which are varied in
their seasons as it were the moon, and those other notices of gifts,
which are reckoned up in order, as it were stars, inasmuch as they come
short of that brightness of [[wisdom]], which gladdens the forementioned
day, are only for the [[rule]] of the night. for they are necessary to such,
as that thy most prudent servant could not speak unto as unto [[spiritual]],
but as unto carnal; even he, who speaketh [[wisdom]] among those that are
perfect. but the [[natural]] [[man]], as it were a babe in [[christ]] and fed on
milk, until he be strengthened for solid meat and his eye be enabled to
behold the sun, let him not dwell in a night forsaken of all [[light]], but
be content with the [[light]] of the moon and the stars. so dost thou speak
to us, our all-wise [[god]], in thy [[book]], thy firmament; that we may discern
all things, in an admirable contemplation; though as yet in signs and in
times, and in days, and in years.

but first, wash you, be clean; put away [[evil]] from your souls [[soul]], and from
before mine [[eyes]], that the dry [[land]] may appear. learn to do [[good]], judge
the fatherless, plead for the widow, that the [[earth]] may bring forth the
green herb for meat, and the tree bearing fruit; and come, let us reason
together, saith the [[lord]], that there may be lights [[light]] in the firmament of
the [[heaven]], and they may shine upon the [[earth]]. that [[rich]] [[man]] [[asked]] of
the [[good]] master, what he should do to attain eternal [[life]]. let the
good master tell him (whom he [[thought]] no more than [[man]]; but he is good
because he is god), let him tell him, if he would enter into [[life]], he
must keep the commandments: let him put away from him the bitterness
of malice and wickedness; not kill, not commit adultery, not steal, not
bear false witness; that the dry [[land]] may appear, and bring forth the
honouring of [[father]] and [[mother]], and the [[love]] of our neighbour. all these
(saith he) have i kept. whence then so many thorns, if the [[earth]] be
fruitful? go, root up the spreading thickets of covetousness; sell that
thou hast, and be filled with fruit, by giving to the [[poor]], and thou
shalt have treasure in [[heaven]]; and [[follow]] the [[lord]] if thou wilt be
perfect, associated with them, among whom he speaketh [[wisdom]], who
knoweth what to distribute to the day, and to the night, that thou also
mayest [[know]] it, and for thee there may be lights [[light]] in the firmament of
heaven; which will not be, unless thy [[heart]] be there: nor will that
either be, unless there thy treasure be; as thou hast heard of the good
master. but that barren [[earth]] was [[grieved]]; and the thorns choked the
word.

but you, chosen [[generation]], you [[weak]] things of the [[world]], who have
forsaken all, that ye may [[follow]] the [[lord]]; go after him, and confound
the mighty; go after him, ye beautiful feet, and shine ye in the
firmament, that the heavens [[heaven]] may declare his [[glory]], dividing between the
light of the [[perfect]], though not as the angels, and the darkness of the
little ones, though not despised. shine over the [[earth]]; and let the
day, lightened by the sun, utter unto day, [[speech]] of [[wisdom]]; and night,
shining with the moon, show unto night, the word of [[knowledge]]. the moon
and stars shine for the night; yet doth not the night obscure them,
seeing they give it [[light]] in its [[degree]]. for behold [[god]] saying, as
it were, let there be lights [[light]] in the firmament of [[heaven]]; there came
suddenly a sound from [[heaven]], as it had been the rushing of a mighty
wind, and there appeared cloven tongues like as of [[fire]], and it sat upon
each of them. and there were made lights [[light]] in the firmament of [[heaven]],
having the word of [[life]]. run ye to and fro every where, ye holy fires [[fire]],
ye beauteous fires [[fire]]; for ye are the [[light]] of the [[world]], nor are ye put
under a bushel; he whom you cleave unto, is exalted, and hath exalted
you. run ye to and fro, and be known unto all nations.

let the sea also conceive and bring forth your works [[work]]; and let the waters
bring forth the moving creature that hath [[life]]. for ye, separating the
precious from the vile, are made the mouth of [[god]], by whom he saith, let
the waters bring forth, not the living creature which the [[earth]] brings
forth, but the moving creature having [[life]], and the fowls that fly above
the [[earth]]. for thy sacraments, o [[god]], by the ministry of thy holy ones,
have moved amid the waves of temptations of the [[world]], to hallow the
gentiles in thy name, in thy baptism. and amid these things, many great
wonders were wrought, as it were [[great]] whales: and the voices of thy
messengers flying above the [[earth]], in the open firmament of thy [[book]];
that being set over them, as their [[authority]] under which they were to
fly, whithersoever they went. for there is no [[speech]] nor [[language]], where
their voice is not heard: seeing their sound is gone through all the
earth, and their words to the end of the [[world]], because thou, [[lord]],
multipliedst them by blessing.

speak i untruly, or do i mingle and confound, and not distinguish
between the lucid [[knowledge]] of these things in the firmament of [[heaven]],
and the material works [[work]] in the wavy sea, and under the firmament of
heaven? for of those things whereof the [[knowledge]] is substantial and
defined, without any increase by [[generation]], as it were lights [[light]] of wisdom
and [[knowledge]], yet even of them, the material operations are many and
divers; and one thing growing out of another, they are multiplied by thy
blessing, o [[god]], who hast refreshed the fastidiousness of mortal senses;
that so one thing in the understanding of our [[mind]], may, by the motions
of the [[body]], be many ways set out, and expressed. these sacraments have
the waters brought forth; but in thy word. the necessities of the people
estranged from the eternity of thy [[truth]], have brought them forth,
but in thy gospel; because the waters themselves cast them forth, the
diseased bitterness whereof was the cause, why they were sent forth in
thy word.

now are all things [[fair]] that thou hast made; but behold, thyself art
unutterably fairer, that madest all; from whom had not adam fallen, the
brackishness of the sea had never flowed out of him, that is, the human
race so profoundly [[curious]], and tempestuously swelling, and restlessly
tumbling up and down; and then had there been no need of thy dispensers
to [[work]] in many waters, after a corporeal and sensible manner,
mysterious doings and sayings. for such those moving and flying
creatures now seem to me to mean, whereby [[people]] being initiated and
consecrated by corporeal sacraments, should not further [[profit]], unless
their [[soul]] had a [[spiritual]] [[life]], and unless after the word of admission,
it looked forwards to [[perfection]].

and hereby, in thy word, not the deepness of the sea, but the earth
separated from the bitterness of the waters, brings forth, not the
moving creature that hath [[life]], but the living [[soul]]. for now hath it no
more need of baptism, as the heathen have, and as itself had, when it
was covered with the waters; (for no other entrance is there into the
kingdom of [[heaven]], since thou hast appointed that this should be the
entrance): nor does it seek after wonderfulness of [[miracles]] to work
belief; for it is not such, that unless it sees signs and wonders, it
will not [[believe]], now that the faithful [[earth]] is separated from the
waters that were bitter with infidelity; and tongues are for a sign, not
to them that [[believe]], but to them that [[believe]] not. neither then does
that [[earth]] which thou hast founded upon the waters, need that flying
kind, which at thy word the waters brought forth. send thou thy word
into it by thy messengers: for we speak of their working, yet it is thou
that workest in them that they may [[work]] out a living [[soul]] in it. the
earth brings it forth, because the [[earth]] is the cause that they work
this in the [[soul]]; as the sea was the cause that they wrought upon
the moving creatures that have [[life]], and the fowls that fly under the
firmament of [[heaven]], of whom the [[earth]] hath no need; although it feeds
upon that fish which was taken out of the deep, upon that table which
thou hast prepared in the presence of them that [[believe]]. for therefore
was he taken out of the deep, that he might feed the dry [[land]]; and the
fowl, though bred in the sea, is yet multiplied upon the [[earth]]. for of
the first preachings of the evangelists, man's [[man]] infidelity was the cause;
yet are the faithful also exhorted and blessed by them manifoldly, from
day to day. but the living [[soul]] takes his beginning from the [[earth]]: for
it profits [[profit]] only those already among the faithful, to contain themselves
from the [[love]] of this [[world]], that so their [[soul]] may [[live]] unto thee,
which was [[dead]] while it lived in pleasures [[pleasure]]; in death-bringing pleasures [[pleasure]],
lord, for thou, [[lord]], art [[arts]] the life-giving delight of the pure [[heart]].

now then let thy ministers [[work]] upon the [[earth]],--not as upon the waters
of infidelity, by preaching and speaking by [[miracles]], and sacraments,
and mystic words; wherein ignorance, the [[mother]] of admiration, might
be intent upon them, out of a reverence towards those secret signs. for
such is the entrance unto the [[faith]] for the sons [[son]] of adam forgetful of
thee, while they hide themselves from thy face, and become a darksome
deep. but--let thy ministers [[work]] now as on the dry [[land]], separated from
the whirlpools of the [[great]] deep: and let them be a pattern unto the
faithful, by living before them, and stirring them up to imitation. for
thus do [[men]] hear, so as not to hear only, but to do also. seek the [[lord]],
and your [[soul]] shall [[live]], that the [[earth]] may bring forth the living
soul. be not conformed to the [[world]]. contain yourselves from it: the
soul lives [[life]] by avoiding what it dies by affecting. contain yourselves
from the ungoverned wildness of [[pride]], the sluggish voluptuousness of
luxury, and the false name of [[knowledge]]: that so the wild beasts may be
tamed, the cattle broken to the yoke, the serpents, harmless. for
these be the motions of our [[mind]] under an allegory; that is to say, the
haughtiness of [[pride]], the delight of [[lust]], and the poison of curiosity,
are the motions of a [[dead]] [[soul]]; for the [[soul]] dies not so as to lose all
motion; because it dies by forsaking the fountain of [[life]], and so is
taken up by this transitory [[world]], and is conformed unto it.

but thy word, o [[god]], is the fountain of [[life]] eternal; and passeth not
away: wherefore this departure of the [[soul]] is restrained by thy word,
when it is said unto us, be not conformed unto this [[world]]; that so the
earth may in the fountain of [[life]] bring forth a living [[soul]]; that is,
a [[soul]] made continent in thy word, by thy evangelists, by following the
followers of thy [[christ]]. for this is after his [[kind]]; because a [[man]] is
wont to imitate his friend. be ye (saith he) as i am, for i also am
as you are. thus in this living [[soul]] shall there be [[good]] beasts, in
meekness of action (for thou hast commanded, go on with thy [[business]] in
meekness, so shalt thou be beloved by all men); and [[good]] cattle, which
neither if they [[eat]], shall they over-abound, nor, if they [[eat]] not, have
any lack; and [[good]] serpents, not dangerous, to do hurt, but [[wise]] to take
heed; and only making so much search into this temporal [[nature]], as may
suffice that eternity be clearly seen, being understood by the things
that are made. for these creatures are [[obedient]] unto [[reason]], when being
restrained from deadly prevailing upon us, they [[live]], and are [[good]].

for behold, o [[lord]], our [[god]], our creator, when our affections have
been restrained from the [[love]] of the [[world]], by which we died through
evil-living; and begun to be a living [[soul]], through [[good]] living; and
thy word which thou spokest by thy apostle, is made [[good]] in us, be not
conformed to this [[world]]: there follows that also, which thou presently
subjoinedst, saying, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your [[mind]];
not now after your [[kind]], as though following your neighbour who went
before you, nor as living after the [[example]] of some [[better]] [[man]] (for thou
saidst not, "let [[man]] be made after his [[kind]]," but, let us make [[man]] after
our own image and similitude), that we might prove what thy will is. for
to this [[purpose]] said that dispenser of thine (who begat [[children]] by the
gospel), that he might not for ever have them babes, whom he must be
fain to feed with milk, and cherish as a nurse; be ye transformed (saith
he) by the renewing of your [[mind]], that ye may prove what is that good
and acceptable and [[perfect]] will of [[god]]. wherefore thou sayest not, "let
man be made," but let us make [[man]]. nor saidst thou, "according to his
kind"; but, after our image and likeness. for [[man]] being renewed in his
mind, and beholding and understanding thy [[truth]], needs not [[man]] as his
director, so as to [[follow]] after his [[kind]]; but by thy direction proveth
what is that [[good]], that acceptable, and [[perfect]] will of thine: yea, thou
teachest him, now made capable, to discern the trinity of the unity, and
the unity of the trinity. wherefore to that said in the plural, let us
make [[man]], is yet subjoined in the singular, and [[god]] made [[man]]: and
to that said in the plural, after our likeness, is subjoined in the
singular, after the image of [[god]]. thus is [[man]] renewed in the knowledge
of [[god]], after the image of him that created him: and being made
spiritual, he judgeth all things (all things which are to be judged),
yet himself is judged of no [[man]].

but that he judgeth all things, this answers [[answer]] to his having dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowls of the air, and over all cattle
and wild beasts, and over all the [[earth]], and over every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the [[earth]]. for this he doth by the understanding of
his [[mind]], whereby he perceiveth the things of the spirit of [[god]]; whereas
otherwise, [[man]] being placed in [[honour]], had no understanding, and is
compared unto the brute beasts, and is become like unto them. in thy
church therefore, o our [[god]], according to thy grace which thou hast
bestowed upon it (for we are thy workmanship created unto good
works), not those only who are spiritually set over, but they also who
spiritually are [[subject]] to those that are set over them,--for in this
way didst thou make [[man]] male and female, in thy grace [[spiritual]], where,
according to the [[sex]] of [[body]], there is neither male nor female, because
neither jew nor grecian, neither bond nor [[free]].--spiritual persons
(whether such as are set over, or such as obey); do [[judge]] spiritually;
not of that [[spiritual]] [[knowledge]] which shines in the firmament (for they
ought not to [[judge]] as to so supreme authority), nor may they [[judge]] of
thy [[book]] itself, even though something there shineth not clearly; for we
submit our understanding unto it, and hold for [[certain]], that even what
is closed to our sight, is yet rightly and truly spoken. for so [[man]],
though now [[spiritual]] and renewed in the [[knowledge]] of [[god]] after his image
that created him, ought to be a doer of the [[law]], not a [[judge]]. neither
doth he [[judge]] of that distinction of [[spiritual]] and carnal [[men]], who
are known unto thine [[eyes]], o our [[god]], and have not as yet discovered
themselves unto us by works [[work]], that by their fruits we might [[know]] them:
but thou, [[lord]], dost even now [[know]] them, and hast divided and called
them in secret, or ever the firmament was made. nor doth he, though
spiritual, [[judge]] the unquiet [[people]] of this [[world]]; for what hath he
to do, to [[judge]] them that are without, knowing not which of them shall
hereafter come into the sweetness of thy grace; and which continue in
the perpetual bitterness of ungodliness?

man therefore, whom thou hast made after thine own image, received not
dominion over the lights [[light]] of [[heaven]], nor over that hidden heaven
itself, nor over the day and the night, which thou calledst before the
foundation of the [[heaven]], nor over the gathering together of the waters,
which is the sea; but he received dominion over the fishes of the sea,
and the fowls of the air, and over all cattle, and over all the [[earth]],
and over all creeping things which creep upon the [[earth]]. for he judgeth
and approveth what he findeth [[right]], and he disalloweth what he findeth
amiss, whether in the celebration of those sacraments by which such
are initiated, as thy [[mercy]] searches out in many waters: or in that, in
which that fish is set forth, which, taken out of the deep, the devout
earth feedeth upon: or in the expressions and signs of words, [[subject]] to
the [[authority]] of thy [[book]],--such signs, as proceed out of the mouth,
and sound forth, flying as it were under the firmament, by interpreting,
expounding, discoursing disputing, consecrating, or praying unto thee,
so that the [[people]] may [[answer]], amen. the vocal pronouncing of all which
words, is occasioned by the deep of this [[world]], and the blindness of the
flesh, which cannot see thoughts [[thought]]; so that there is need to speak aloud
into the ears; so that, although flying fowls be multiplied upon the
earth, yet they derive their beginning from the waters. the spiritual
man judgeth also by allowing of what is [[right]], and disallowing what he
finds amiss, in the works [[work]] and lives [[life]] of the faithful; their alms, as it
were the [[earth]] bringing forth fruit, and of the living [[soul]], living
by the taming of the affections, in chastity, in fasting, in holy
meditations; and of those things, which are perceived by the senses of
the [[body]]. upon all these is he now said to [[judge]], wherein he hath also
power of correction.

but what is this, and what [[kind]] of mystery? behold, thou blessest
mankind, o [[lord]], that they may increase and multiply, and replenish the
earth; dost thou not thereby give us a hint to [[understand]] something? why
didst thou not as well bless the [[light]], which thou calledst day; nor the
firmament of [[heaven]], nor the lights [[light]], nor the stars, nor the [[earth]], nor
the sea? i might say that thou, o [[god]], who created created us after
thine image, i might say, that it had been thy [[good]] [[pleasure]] to bestow
this blessing peculiarly upon [[man]]; hadst thou not in like manner blessed
the fishes and the whales, that they should increase and multiply, and
replenish the waters of the sea, and that the fowls should be multiplied
upon the [[earth]]. i might say likewise, that this blessing pertained
properly unto such creatures, as are bred of their own [[kind]], had i found
it given to the fruit-trees, and plants, and beasts of the [[earth]]. but
now neither unto the herbs, nor the trees, nor the beasts, nor serpents
is it said, increase and multiply; notwithstanding all these as well as
the fishes, fowls, or [[men]], do by [[generation]] increase and continue their
kind.

what then shall i say, o [[truth]] my [[light]]? "that it was idly said, and
without meaning?" not so, o [[father]] of piety, far be it from a minister
of thy word to say so. and if i [[understand]] not what thou meanest by
that phrase, let my betters, that is, those of more understanding than
myself, make [[better]] use of it, according as thou, my [[god]], hast given to
each [[man]] to [[understand]]. but let my [[confession]] also be pleasing in thine
eyes, wherein i confess unto thee, that i [[believe]], o [[lord]], that thou
spokest not so in [[vain]]; nor will i suppress, what this lesson suggests
to me. for it is true, nor do i see what should hinder me from thus
understanding the figurative sayings of thy bible. for i [[know]] a thing
to be manifoldly signified by corporeal expressions, which is understood
one way by the [[mind]]; and that understood many ways in the [[mind]], which
is signified one way by corporeal expression. behold, the [[single]] love
of [[god]] and our neighbour, by what manifold sacraments, and innumerable
languages, and in each several [[language]], in how innumerable modes of
speaking, it is corporeally expressed. thus do the offspring of the
waters increase and multiply. observe again, whosoever readest this;
behold, what [[scripture]] delivers, and the voice pronounces one only way,
in the beginning [[god]] created [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; is it not understood
manifoldly, not through any deceit of error, but by various kinds [[kind]] of
true senses? thus do man's [[man]] offspring increase and multiply.

if therefore we conceive of the natures [[nature]] of the things themselves, not
allegorically, but properly, then does the phrase increase and multiply,
agree unto all things, that come of seed. but if we treat of the words
as figuratively spoken (which i rather suppose to be the [[purpose]] of
the [[scripture]], which doth not, surely, superfluously ascribe this
benediction to the offspring of aquatic animals and [[man]] only); then
do we find "multitude" to belong to creatures [[spiritual]] as well as
corporeal, as in [[heaven]] and [[earth]], and to righteous and unrighteous, as
in [[light]] and darkness; and to holy authors who have been the ministers
of the [[law]] unto us, as in the firmament which is settled betwixt
the waters and the waters; and to the [[society]] of [[people]] yet in the
bitterness of infidelity, as in the sea; and to the zeal of holy souls [[soul]],
as in the dry [[land]]; and to works [[work]] of [[mercy]] belonging to this present
life, as in the herbs bearing seed, and in trees bearing fruit; and to
spiritual gifts set forth for edification, as in the lights [[light]] of [[heaven]];
and to affections formed unto temperance, as in the living [[soul]]. in all
these instances we meet with multitudes, abundance, and increase; but
what shall in such [[wise]] increase and multiply that one thing may be
expressed many ways, and one expression understood many ways; we find
not, except in signs corporeally expressed, and in things mentally
conceived. by signs corporeally pronounced we [[understand]] the generations
of the waters, necessarily occasioned by the depth of the flesh;
by things mentally conceived, [[human]] generations [[generation]], on account of the
fruitfulness of [[reason]]. and for this end do we [[believe]] thee, [[lord]], to
have said to these kinds [[kind]], increase and multiply. for in this blessing, i
conceive thee to have granted us a [[power]] and a faculty, both to express
several ways what we [[understand]] but one; and to [[understand]] several ways,
what we [[read]] to be obscurely delivered but in one. thus are the
waters of the sea replenished, which are not moved but by several
significations: thus with [[human]] increase is the [[earth]] also replenished,
whose dryness appeareth in its longing, and [[reason]] ruleth over it.

i would also say, o [[lord]] my [[god]], what the following [[scripture]] minds [[mind]] me
of; yea, i will say, and not [[fear]]. for i will say the [[truth]], thyself
inspiring me with what thou willedst me to deliver out of those words.
but by no other inspiration than thine, do i [[believe]] myself to speak
truth, seeing thou art [[arts]] the [[truth]], and every [[man]] a liar. he therefore
that speaketh a [[lie]], speaketh of his own; that therefore i may speak
truth, i will speak of thine. behold, thou hast given unto us for food
every herb bearing seed which is upon all the [[earth]]; and every tree,
in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed. and not to us alone, but
also to all the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the [[earth]], and to
all creeping things; but unto the fishes and to the [[great]] whales, hast
thou not given them. now we said that by these fruits of the [[earth]] were
signified, and figured in an allegory, the works [[work]] of [[mercy]] which are
provided for the necessities of this [[life]] out of the fruitful [[earth]].
such an [[earth]] was the devout onesiphorus, unto whose house thou gavest
mercy, because he often refreshed thy paul, and was not ashamed of his
chain. thus did also the brethren [[brother]], and such fruit did they bear, who out
of macedonia supplied what was lacking to him. but how [[grieved]] he for
some trees, which did not afford him the fruit due unto him, where he
saith, at my first [[answer]] no [[man]] stood by me, but all [[men]] forsook me. i
pray [[god]] that it may not be laid to their charge. for these fruits are
due to such as minister the [[spiritual]] doctrine unto us out of their
understanding of the [[divine]] mysteries; and they are due to them, as [[men]];
yea and due to them also, as the living [[soul]], which giveth itself as an
example, in all continency; and due unto them also, as flying creatures,
for their blessings which are multiplied upon the [[earth]], because their
sound went out into all lands [[land]].

but they are fed by these fruits, that are delighted with them; nor are
they delighted with them, whose [[god]] is their belly. for neither in them
that yield them, are the things yielded the fruit, but with what mind
they yield them. he therefore that served [[god]], and not his own belly,
i plainly see why he rejoiced; i see it, and i rejoice with him. for he
had received from the philippians, what they had sent by epaphroditus
unto him: and yet i perceive why he rejoiced. for whereat he rejoiced
upon that he fed; for, speaking in [[truth]], i rejoiced (saith he) greatly
in the [[lord]], that now at the [[last]] your [[care]] of me hath flourished again,
wherein ye were also careful, but it had become wearisome unto you.
these philippians then had now dried up, with a long weariness, and
withered as it were as to bearing this fruit of a [[good]] [[work]]; and he
rejoiceth for them, that they flourished again, not for himself, that
they supplied his wants. therefore subjoins he, not that i speak in
respect of want, for i have learned in whatsoever [[state]] i am, therewith
to be content. i [[know]] both how to be abased, and i [[know]] how to abound;
every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full, and to be
hungry; both to abound, and to suffer need. i can do all things through
him which strengtheneth me.

whereat then rejoicest thou, o [[great]] paul? whereat rejoicest thou?
whereon feedest thou, o [[man]], renewed in the [[knowledge]] of [[god]], after the
image of him that created thee, thou living [[soul]], of so much continency,
thou tongue like flying fowls, speaking mysteries? (for to such
creatures, is this food due;) what is it that feeds thee? joy. hear
we what follows: notwithstanding, ye have well done, that ye did
communicate with my affliction. hereat he rejoiceth, hereon feedeth;
because they had well done, not because his strait was eased, who saith
unto thee, thou hast enlarged me when i was in distress; for that he
knew to abound, and to suffer want, in thee who strengthenest him.
for ye philippians also [[know]] (saith he), that in the beginning of the
gospel, when i departed from macedonia, no [[church]] communicated with
me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. for even in
thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. unto these good
works, he now rejoiceth that they are returned; and is gladdened that
they flourished again, as when a fruitful field resumes its green.

was it for his own necessities, because he said, ye sent unto my
necessity? rejoiceth he for that? verily not for that. but how [[know]] we
this? because himself says immediately, not because i [[desire]] a gift, but
i [[desire]] fruit. i have learned of thee, my [[god]], to distinguish betwixt
a gift, and fruit. a gift, is the thing itself which he gives, that
imparts these necessaries unto us; as [[money]], meat, drink, clothing,
shelter, [[help]]: but the fruit, is the [[good]] and [[right]] will of the giver.
for the [[good]] master said not only, he that receiveth a [[prophet]], but
added, in the name of a [[prophet]]: nor did he only say, he that receiveth
a righteous [[man]], but added, in the name of a righteous [[man]]. so verily
shall the one receive the [[reward]] of a [[prophet]], the other, the [[reward]] of
a righteous [[man]]: nor saith he only, he that shall give to drink a cup
of cold water to one of my little ones; but added, in the name of a
disciple: and so concludeth, verily i say unto you, he shall not lose
his [[reward]]. the gift is, to receive a [[prophet]], to receive a righteous
man, to give a cup of cold water to a disciple: but the fruit, to do
this in the name of a [[prophet]], in the name of a righteous [[man]], in the
name of a disciple. with fruit was elijah fed by the widow that knew
she fed a [[man]] of [[god]], and therefore fed him: but by the raven was he fed
with a gift. nor was the inner [[man]] of elijah so fed, but the outer only;
which might also for want of that food have perished.

i will then speak what is true in thy sight, o [[lord]], that when carnal
men and infidels (for the gaining and initiating whom, the initiatory
sacraments and the mighty workings of [[miracles]] are necessary, which we
suppose to be signified by the name of fishes and whales) undertake
the bodily refreshment, or otherwise succour thy servant with something
useful for this [[present]] [[life]]; whereas they be ignorant, why this is to
be done, and to what end; neither do they feed these, nor are these
fed by them; because neither do the one do it out of an holy and right
intent; nor do the other rejoice at their gifts, whose fruit they as
yet behold not. for upon that is the [[mind]] fed, of which it is glad.
and therefore do not the fishes and whales feed upon such meats, as the
earth brings not forth until after it was separated and divided from the
bitterness of the waves of the sea.

and thou, o [[god]], sawest every thing that thou hadst made, and, behold,
it was very [[good]]. yea we also see the same, and behold, all things are
very [[good]]. of the several kinds [[kind]] of thy works [[work]], when thou hadst said "let
them be," and they were, thou sawest each that it was [[good]]. seven times
have i counted it to be written, that thou sawest that that which thou
madest was [[good]]: and this is the eighth, that thou sawest every thing
that thou hadst made, and, behold, it was not only [[good]], but also very
good, as being now altogether. for severally, they were only [[good]]; but
altogether, both [[good]], and very [[good]]. all beautiful bodies [[body]] express the
same; by [[reason]] that a [[body]] consisting of members all beautiful, is
far more beautiful than the same members by themselves are, by whose
well-ordered blending the whole is perfected; notwithstanding that the
members severally be also beautiful.

and i looked narrowly to find, whether seven, or eight times [[time]] thou sawest
that thy works [[work]] were [[good]], when they pleased thee; but in thy seeing i
found no times [[time]], whereby i might [[understand]] that thou sawest so often,
what thou madest. and i said, "lord, is not this thy [[scripture]] true,
since thou art [[arts]] true, and being [[truth]], hast set it forth? why then dost
thou say unto me, 'that in thy seeing there be no times'; whereas this
thy [[scripture]] tells me, that what thou madest each day, thou sawest that
it was [[good]]: and when i counted them, i found how often." unto this thou
answerest me, for thou art [[arts]] my [[god]], and with a [[strong]] voice tellest thy
servant in his inner ear, breaking through my deafness and crying, "o
man, that which my [[scripture]] saith, i say: and yet doth that speak in
time; but [[time]] has no relation to my word; because my word exists
in [[equal]] eternity with myself. so the things which ye see through my
spirit, i see; like as what ye speak by my spirit, i speak. and so when
ye see those things in [[time]], i see them not in [[time]]; as when ye speak in
time, i speak them not in [[time]]."

and i heard, o [[lord]] my [[god]], and drank up a drop of sweetness out of thy
truth, and understood, that [[certain]] [[men]] there be who mislike thy works [[work]];
and say, that many of them thou madest, compelled by necessity; such
as the fabric of the heavens [[heaven]], and harmony of the stars; and that thou
madest them not of what was thine, but that they were otherwhere and
from other sources created, for thee to bring together and compact and
combine, when out of thy conquered enemies [[enemy]] thou raisedst up the walls of
the [[universe]]; that they, bound down by the structure, might not again
be able to rebel against thee. for other things, they say thou neither
madest them, nor even compactedst them, such as all flesh and all very
minute creatures, and whatsoever hath its root in the [[earth]]; but that
a [[mind]] at enmity with thee, and another [[nature]] not created by thee, and
contrary unto thee, did, in these lower stages of the [[world]], beget and
frame these things. frenzied are they who say thus, because they see not
thy works [[work]] by thy spirit, nor recognise thee in them.

but they who by thy spirit see these things, thou seest in them.
therefore when they see that these things are [[good]], thou seest that they
are [[good]]; and whatsoever things for thy sake please, thou pleasest in
them, and what through thy spirit please us, they please thee in us. for
what [[man]] knoweth the things of a [[man]], save the spirit of a [[man]], which is
in him? even so the things of [[god]] knoweth no one, but the spirit of [[god]].
now we (saith he) have received, not the spirit of this [[world]], but the
spirit which is of [[god]], that we might [[know]] the things that are freely
given to us of [[god]]. and i am admonished, "truly the things of god
knoweth no one, but the spirit of [[god]]: how then do we also [[know]], what
things are given us of [[god]]?" [[answer]] is made me; "because the things
which we [[know]] by his spirit, even these no one knoweth, but the spirit
of [[god]]. for as it is rightly said unto those that were to speak by the
spirit of [[god]], it is not ye that speak: so is it rightly said to them
that [[know]] through the spirit of [[god]], 'it is not ye that [[know]].' and no
less then is it rightly said to those that see through the spirit of
god, 'it is not ye that see'; so whatsoever through the spirit of god
they see to be [[good]], it is not they, but [[god]] that sees that it is [[good]]."
it is one thing then for a [[man]] to [[think]] that to be ill which is [[good]],
as the forenamed do; another, that that which is [[good]], a [[man]] should see
that it is [[good]] (as thy creatures be pleasing unto many, because they
be [[good]], whom yet thou pleasest not in them, when they prefer to enjoy
them, to thee); and another, that when a [[man]] sees a thing that it is
good, [[god]] should in him see that it is [[good]], so, namely, that he should
be loved in that which he made, who cannot be loved, but by the holy
ghost which he hath given. because the [[love]] of [[god]] is shed abroad in our
hearts by the holy ghost, which is given unto us: by whom we see that
whatsoever in any [[degree]] is, is [[good]]. for from him it is, who himself is
not in [[degree]], but what he is, is.

thanks to thee, o [[lord]]. we behold the [[heaven]] and [[earth]], whether the
corporeal part, superior and inferior, or the [[spiritual]] and corporeal
creature; and in the adorning of these parts, whereof the universal pile
of the [[world]], or rather the universal creation, doth consist, we see
light made, and divided from the darkness. we see the firmament of
heaven, whether that primary [[body]] of the [[world]], between the spiritual
upper waters and the inferior corporeal waters, or (since this also
is called heaven) this space of air through which wander the fowls of
heaven, betwixt those waters which are in vapours borne above them, and
in clear nights distill down in dew; and those heavier waters which flow
along the [[earth]]. we behold a face of waters gathered together in the
fields of the sea; and the dry [[land]] both void, and formed so as to be
visible and harmonized, yea and the matter of herbs and trees. we behold
the lights [[light]] shining from above, the sun to suffice for the day, the moon
and the stars to cheer the night; and that by all these, times [[time]] should
be marked and signified. we behold on all sides a moist element,
replenished with fishes, beasts, and birds; because the grossness of
the air, which bears up the flights of birds, thickeneth itself by the
exhalation of the waters. we behold the face of the [[earth]] decked out
with earthly creatures, and [[man]], created after thy image and likeness,
even through that thy very image and likeness (that is the [[power]] of
reason and understanding), set over all irrational creatures. and as
in his [[soul]] there is one [[power]] which has dominion by directing, another
made [[subject]], that it might obey; so was there for the [[man]], corporeally
also, made a woman, who in the [[mind]] of her reasonable understanding
should have a parity of [[nature]], but in the [[sex]] of her [[body]], should be in
like manner [[subject]] to the [[sex]] of her husband, as the appetite of doing
is fain to conceive the [[skill]] of right-doing from the [[reason]] of
the [[mind]]. these things we behold, and they are severally [[good]], and
altogether very [[good]].

let thy works [[work]] [[praise]] thee, that we may [[love]] thee; and let us [[love]] thee,
that thy works [[work]] may [[praise]] thee, which from [[time]] have beginning and
ending, rising and setting, [[growth]] and decay, form and privation. they
have then their succession of morning and evening, part secretly, part
apparently; for they were made of nothing, by thee, not of thee; not of
any matter not thine, or that was before, but of matter concreated (that
is, at the same [[time]] created by thee), because to its [[state]] without
form, thou without any interval of [[time]] didst give form. for seeing
the matter of [[heaven]] and [[earth]] is one thing, and the form another, thou
madest the matter of merely nothing, but the form of the [[world]] out of
the matter without form: yet both together, so that the form should
follow the matter, without any interval of delay.

we have also examined what thou willedst to be shadowed forth, whether
by the creation, or the relation of things in such an order. and we have
seen, that things singly are [[good]], and together very [[good]], in thy word,
in thy only-begotten, both [[heaven]] and [[earth]], the head and the [[body]] of
the [[church]], in thy predestination before all times [[time]], without morning
and evening. but when thou begannest to execute in [[time]] the things
predestinated, to the end thou mightest reveal hidden things, and
rectify our disorders; for our sins [[sin]] hung over us, and we had sunk into
the dark deep; and thy [[good]] spirit was borne over us, to [[help]] us in due
season; and thou didst justify the ungodly, and dividest them from the
wicked; and thou madest the firmament of [[authority]] of thy [[book]] between
those placed above, who were to be docile unto thee, and those under,
who were to be [[subject]] to them: and thou gatheredst together the society
of unbelievers into one conspiracy, that the zeal of the faithful might
appear, and they might bring forth works [[work]] of [[mercy]], even distributing to
the [[poor]] their earthly riches [[rich]], to obtain heavenly. and after this didst
thou kindle [[certain]] lights [[light]] in the firmament, thy holy ones, having the
word of [[life]]; and shining with an eminent [[authority]] set on high through
spiritual gifts; after that again, for the initiation of the unbelieving
gentiles, didst thou out of corporeal matter [[produce]] the sacraments, and
visible [[miracles]], and forms of words according to the firmament of thy
book, by which the faithful should be blessed and multiplied. next
didst thou form the living [[soul]] of the faithful, through affections well
ordered by the vigour of continency: and after that, the [[mind]] subjected
to thee alone and needing to imitate no [[human]] [[authority]], hast thou
renewed after thy image and likeness; and didst [[subject]] its rational
actions to the excellency of the understanding, as the woman to the [[man]];
and to all offices of thy ministry, necessary for the perfecting of the
faithful in this [[life]], thou willedst, that for their temporal uses, good
things, fruitful to themselves in [[time]] to come, be given by the same
faithful. all these we see, and they are very [[good]], because thou seest
them in us, who hast given unto us thy spirit, by which we might see
them, and in them [[love]] thee.

o [[lord]] [[god]], give [[peace]] unto us: (for thou hast given us all things;) the
peace of rest, the [[peace]] of the [[sabbath]], which hath no evening. for
all this most goodly array of things very [[good]], having finished their
courses, is to pass away, for in them there was morning and evening.

but the seventh day hath no evening, nor hath it setting; because thou
hast sanctified it to an everlasting continuance; that that which thou
didst after thy works [[work]] which were very [[good]], resting the seventh day,
although thou madest them in unbroken rest, that may the voice of
thy [[book]] announce beforehand unto us, that we also after our works
(therefore very [[good]], because thou hast given them us), shall rest in
thee also in the [[sabbath]] of eternal [[life]].

for then shalt thou rest in us, as now thou workest in us; and so shall
that be thy rest through us, as these are thy works [[work]] through us. but
thou, [[lord]], ever workest, and art [[arts]] ever at rest. nor dost thou see in
time, nor art [[arts]] moved in [[time]], nor restest in a [[time]]; and yet thou makest
things seen in [[time]], yea the times [[time]] themselves, and the rest which
results from [[time]].

we therefore see these things which thou madest, because they are: but
they are, because thou seest them. and we see without, that they are,
and within, that they are [[good]], but thou sawest them there, when made,
where thou sawest them, yet to be made. and we were at a later time
moved to do well, after our hearts [[heart]] had conceived of thy spirit; but in
the former [[time]] we were moved to do [[evil]], forsaking thee; but thou, the
one, the [[good]] [[god]], didst never cease doing [[good]]. and we also have some
good works [[work]], of thy gift, but not eternal; after them we trust to rest in
thy [[great]] hallowing. but thou, being the [[good]] which needeth no [[good]], art
ever at rest, because thy rest is thou thyself. and what [[man]] can teach
man to [[understand]] this? or what angel, an angel? or what angel, a [[man]]?
let it be [[asked]] of thee, sought in thee, knocked for at thee; so, so
shall it be received, so shall it be found, so shall it be opened. amen.

                         gratias tibi domine
