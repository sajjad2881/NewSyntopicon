introduction


for the study of the [[great]] writers and thinkers of the [[past]], historical
imagination is the first necessity. without mentally referring to the
environment in which they lived, we cannot [[hope]] to penetrate below the
inessential and temporary to the absolute and permanent value of their
thought. theory, no less than action, is [[subject]] to these necessities;
the form in which [[men]] cast their speculations, no less than the ways
in which they behave, are the result of the habits of [[thought]] and
action which they find around them. [[great]] [[men]] make, indeed, individual
contributions to the [[knowledge]] of their times [[time]]; but they can never
transcend the [[age]] in which they [[live]]. the questions [[question]] they try to answer
will always be those their contemporaries are asking; their statement
of fundamental problems will always be relative to the traditional
statements that have been handed down to them. when they are stating
what is most startlingly new, they will be most likely to put it in an
old-fashioned form, and to use the inadequate ideas [[idea]] and formulae of
tradition to express the deeper truths [[truth]] towards which they are feeling
their way. they will be most the [[children]] of their [[age]], when they are
rising most above it.

rousseau has [[suffered]] as much as any one from critics without a sense
of [[history]]. he has been cried up and cried down by democrats and
oppressors with an [[equal]] lack of understanding and [[imagination]]. his
name, a hundred and fifty years after the publication of the _social
contract_, is still a controversial watchword and a party cry. he is
accepted as one of the [[greatest]] writers [[france]] has produced; but even
now [[men]] are inclined, as [[political]] bias prompts them, to accept or
reject his [[political]] doctrines as a whole, without sifting them or
attempting to [[understand]] and discriminate. he is still revered or hated
as the author who, above all others, inspired the french [[revolution]].

at the [[present]] day, his works [[work]] possess a double significance. they are
important historically, alike as giving us an insight into the mind
of the eighteenth century, and for the actual influence they have had
on the course of events in [[europe]]. certainly no other writer of the
time has exercised such an influence as his. he may fairly be called
the parent of the romantic movement in art [[arts]], letters and [[life]]; he
affected profoundly the [[german]] romantics and goethe himself; he set the
fashion of a new introspection which has permeated nineteenth century
literature; he began [[modern]] educational theory; and, above all, in
political [[thought]] he represents the passage from a traditional theory
rooted in the middle ages [[age]] to the [[modern]] [[philosophy]] of the [[state]]. his
influence on kant's [[moral]] [[philosophy]] and on hegel's [[philosophy]] of right
are two sides of the same fundamental contribution to [[modern]] [[thought]].
he is, in [[fact]], the [[great]] forerunner of [[german]] and english idealism.

it would not be possible, in the course of a short introduction, to
deal both with the positive content of rousseau's [[thought]] and with
the actual influence he has had on practical affairs. the statesmen
of the french [[revolution]], from robespierre downwards, were throughout
profoundly affected by the study of his works [[work]]. though they seem often
to have misunderstood him, they had on the whole [[studied]] him with
the attention he demands. in the nineteenth century, [[men]] continued
to appeal to [[rousseau]], without, as a [[rule]], knowing him well or
penetrating deeply into his meaning. "the _social contract_," says
m. dreyfus-brisac, "is the [[book]] of all books [[book]] that is most talked of
and least [[read]]." but with the [[great]] revival of interest in political
philosophy there has come a [[desire]] for the [[better]] understanding of
rousseau's [[work]]. he is again being [[studied]] more as a thinker and less
as an ally or an opponent; there is more eagerness to sift the true
from the false, and to seek in the _social contract_ the "principles of
political [[right]]," rather than the [[great]] revolutionary's _ipse dixit_
in favour of some view about circumstances which he could never have
contemplated.

the _social contract_, then, may be regarded either as a document
of the french [[revolution]], or as one of the [[greatest]] books [[book]] dealing
with [[political]] [[philosophy]]. it is in the second capacity, as a work
of permanent value containing [[truth]], that it finds a place among the
world's [[great]] books [[book]]. it is in that capacity also that it will be
treated in this introduction. taking it in this aspect, we have no less
need of historical insight than if we came to it as historians pure and
simple. to [[understand]] its value we must grasp its limitations; when
the questions [[question]] it answers [[answer]] seem unnaturally put, we must not conclude
that they are meaningless; we must see if the [[answer]] still holds when
the [[question]] is put in a more up-to-date form.

first, then, we must always [[remember]] that [[rousseau]] is writing in the
eighteenth century, and for the most part in [[france]]. neither the french
monarchy nor the genevese [[aristocracy]] loved outspoken criticism,
and [[rousseau]] had always to be very careful what he said. this may
seem a [[curious]] statement to make about a [[man]] who [[suffered]] continual
persecution on account of his subversive doctrines; but, although
rousseau was one of the most daring writers of his [[time]], he was forced
continually to moderate his [[language]] and, as a [[rule]], to confine himself
to generalisation instead of attacking particular abuses [[abuse]]. rousseau's
theory has often been decried as too abstract and metaphysical. this is
in many ways its [[great]] [[strength]]; but where it is excessively so, the
accident of [[time]] is to blame. in the eighteenth century it was, broadly
speaking, safe to generalise and unsafe to particularise. scepticism
and discontent were the prevailing temper of the intellectual classes,
and a short-sighted despotism held that, as long as they were confined
to these, they would do little harm. subversive doctrines were only
regarded as dangerous when they were so put as to appeal to the
masses; [[philosophy]] was regarded as impotent. the intellectuals of the
eighteenth century therefore generalised to their hearts' content, and
as a [[rule]] [[suffered]] little for their _lèse-majesté_: voltaire is the
typical [[example]] of such generalisation. the spirit of the [[age]] favoured
such methods, and it was therefore [[natural]] for [[rousseau]] to pursue
them. but his general remarks had such a way of bearing very obvious
particular applications, and were so obviously inspired by a particular
attitude towards the [[government]] of his day, that even [[philosophy]] became
in his hands unsafe, and he was attacked for what [[men]] [[read]] between
the lines of his works [[work]]. it is owing to this faculty of giving his
generalisations content and actuality that [[rousseau]] has become the
father of [[modern]] [[political]] [[philosophy]]. he uses the method of his time
only to transcend it; out of the abstract and general he creates the
concrete and universal.

secondly, we must not forget that rousseau's theories are to be studied
in a wider historical environment. if he is the first of modern
political theorists, he is also the [[last]] of a long line of renaissance
theorists, who in turn inherit and transform the concepts of mediæval
thought. so many critics have spent so much wasted [[time]] in proving
that [[rousseau]] was not original only because they began by identifying
originality with isolation: they [[studied]] first the _social contract_ by
itself, out of relation to earlier works [[work]], and then, having discovered
that these earlier works [[work]] resembled it, decided that everything it had
to say was borrowed. had they begun their study in a truly historical
spirit, they would have seen that rousseau's importance lies [[lie]] just in
the new use he makes of old ideas [[idea]], in the transition he makes from old
to new in the general conception of [[politics]]. no mere innovator could
have exercised such an influence or hit on so much [[truth]]. theory makes
no [[great]] leaps; it proceeds to new concepts by the adjustment and
renovation of old ones. just as theological writers on [[politics]], from
hooker to bossuet, make use of biblical terminology and ideas [[idea]]; just as
more [[modern]] writers, from hegel to herbert spencer, make use of the
concept of evolution, [[rousseau]] uses the ideas [[idea]] and terms of the social
contract theory. we should [[feel]], throughout his [[work]], his struggle to
free himself from what is lifeless and outworn in that theory, while
he develops out of it fruitful conceptions that go beyond its scope. a
too rigid literalism in the interpretation of rousseau's [[thought]] may
easily reduce it to the possession of a merely "historical interest":
if we approach it in a truly historical spirit, we shall be able to
appreciate at once its temporary and its lasting value, to see how it
served his contemporaries, and at the same [[time]] to disentangle from it
what may be serviceable to us and for all [[time]].

rousseau's _emile_, the [[greatest]] of all works [[work]] on [[education]], has already
been issued in this series. in this volume are contained the most
important of his [[political]] works [[work]]. of these the _social contract_, by
far the most significant, is the latest in date. it represents the
maturity of his [[thought]], while the other works [[work]] only illustrate his
development. born in 1712, he issued no [[work]] of importance till 1750;
but he tells us, in the _confessions,_ that in 1743, when he was
attached to the embassy at venice, he had already conceived the [[idea]] of
a [[great]] [[work]] on _political institutions_, "which was to put the seal on
his [[reputation]]." he seems, however, to have made little [[progress]] with
this [[work]], until in 1749 he happened to [[light]] on the announcement of a
prize offered by the academy of dijon for an [[answer]] to the [[question]],
"has the [[progress]] of the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] tended to the purification
or to the [[corruption]] of morality?" his old ideas [[idea]] came thronging back,
and sick at [[heart]] of the [[life]] he had been leading among the paris
_lumières_, he composed a [[violent]] and rhetorical diatribe against
civilisation generally. in the following year, this [[work]], having been
awarded the prize by the academy, was published by its author. his
success was instantaneous; he became at once a famous [[man]], the "lion"
of parisian literary circles. refutations of his [[work]] were issued by
professors, scribblers, outraged theologians and even by the [[king]] of
poland. [[rousseau]] endeavoured to [[answer]] them all, and in the course of
argument his [[thought]] developed. from 1750 to the publication of the
_social contract_ and _emile_ in 1762 he gradually evolved his views:
in those twelve years he made his unique contribution to political
thought.

the _discourse on the [[arts]] and sciences_, the earliest of the works
reproduced in this volume, is not in itself of very [[great]] importance.
rousseau has given his [[opinion]] of it in the _confessions_. "full of
warmth and [[force]], it is wholly without [[logic]] or order; of all my
works it is the weakest in argument and the least harmonious. but
whatever gifts a [[man]] may be born with, he cannot learn the art [[arts]] of
writing in a moment." this criticism is just. the first discourse
neither is, nor attempts to be, a reasoned or a balanced production.
it is the [[speech]] of an advocate, wholly one-sided and arbitrary, but
so obviously and naively one-sided, that it is difficult for us to
believe in its entire seriousness. at the most, it is only a rather
brilliant but flimsy rhetorical effort, a sophistical improvisation,
but not a serious contribution to [[thought]]. yet it is [[certain]] that this
declamation made rousseau's name, and established his position as a
great writer in parisian circles. d'alembert even devoted the preface
of the _encyclopædia_ to a refutation. the plan of the first discourse
is essentially simple: it sets out from the badness, immorality and
misery of [[modern]] nations, traces all these ills to the departure from a
"natural" [[state]], and then credits the [[progress]] of the [[arts]] and sciences
with being the cause of that departure. in it, [[rousseau]] is already in
possession of his [[idea]] of "nature" as an ideal; but he has at present
made no attempt to discriminate, in what is unnatural, between good
and [[bad]]. he is merely using a [[single]] [[idea]], putting it as strongly as
he can, and neglecting all its limitations. the first discourse is
important not for any positive doctrine it contains, but as a key to
the [[development]] of rousseau's [[mind]]. here we see him at the beginning
of the long [[journey]] which was to lead on at [[last]] to the theory of the
_social contract_.

in 1755 appeared the _discourse on the origin and foundation of
inequality among men_, which is the second of the works [[work]] given in this
volume. with this essay, [[rousseau]] had unsuccessfully competed in 1753
for a second prize offered by the academy of dijon, and he now issued
it prefaced by a long dedication to the [[republic]] of geneva. in this
work, which voltaire, in thanking him for a presentation copy, termed
his "second [[book]] against the [[human]] [[race]]," his style and his ideas
have made a [[great]] advance; he is no longer content merely to push a
single [[idea]] to extremes: while preserving the broad opposition between
the [[state]] of [[nature]] and the [[state]] of [[society]], which runs through all
his [[work]], he is concerned to [[present]] a [[rational]] justification of
his views and to admit that a little at any rate may be said on the
other side. moreover, the [[idea]] of "nature" has already undergone a
great [[development]]; it is no longer an empty opposition to the evils
of [[society]]; it possesses a positive content. thus half the _discourse
on inequality_ is occupied by an imaginary description of the state
of [[nature]], in which [[man]] is shown with ideas [[idea]] limited within the
narrowest range, with little need of his fellows, and little care
beyond provision for the necessities of the moment. [[rousseau]] declares
explicitly that he does not suppose the "state of nature" ever to have
existed: it is a pure "idea of [[reason]]," a working concept reached by
abstraction from the "state of [[society]]." the "natural [[man]]," as opposed
to "man's [[man]]," is [[man]] stripped of all that [[society]] confers upon him, a
creature formed by a process of abstraction, and never intended for a
historical portrait. the conclusion of the discourse favours not this
purely abstract being, but a [[state]] of savagery intermediate between the
"natural" and the "social" conditions, in which [[men]] may preserve the
simplicity and the advantages of [[nature]] and at the same [[time]] secure the
rude comforts and assurances of early [[society]]. in one of the long notes
appended to the discourse, [[rousseau]] further explains his position.
he does not [[wish]], he says, that [[modern]] [[corrupt]] [[society]] should return
to a [[state]] of [[nature]]: [[corruption]] has gone too far for that; he only
desires now that [[men]] should palliate, by wiser use of the fatal [[arts]],
the mistake of their introduction. he recognises [[society]] as inevitable
and is already feeling his way towards a justification of it. the
second discourse represents a second stage in his [[political]] [[thought]]:
the opposition between the [[state]] of [[nature]] and the [[state]] of [[society]] is
still presented in naked contrast; but the picture of the former has
already filled out, and it only remains for [[rousseau]] to take a nearer
view of the fundamental implications of the [[state]] of [[society]] for his
thought to reach maturity.

rousseau is often blamed, by [[modern]] critics, for pursuing in the
discourses a method apparently that of [[history]], but in reality wholly
unhistorical. but it must be remembered that he himself lays no
stress on the historical aspect of his [[work]]; he gives himself out
as constructing a purely ideal picture, and not as depicting any
actual stages in [[human]] [[history]]. the use of false historical concepts
is characteristic of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and
rousseau is more to be congratulated on having escaped from giving them
too much importance than criticised for employing them at all.

it is doubtful whether the _discourse on [[political]] economy,_ first
printed in the [[great]] _encyclopædia_ in 1755, was composed before or
after the _discourse on inequality_. at first sight the former seems to
be far more in the manner of the _social contract_ and to contain views
belonging essentially to rousseau's constructive period. it would not,
however, be safe to conclude from this that its date is really later.
the _discourse on inequality_ still has about it much of the rhetorical
looseness of the prize essay; it aims not so much at close reasoning
as at effective and popular presentation of a case. but, by reading
between the lines, an attentive student can detect in it a great
deal of the positive doctrine afterwards incorporated in the _social
contract_. especially in the closing section, which lays down the plan
of a general treatment of the fundamental questions [[question]] of [[politics]], we
are already to some extent in the atmosphere of the later works [[work]]. it
is indeed almost [[certain]] that [[rousseau]] never attempted to put into
either of the first two discourses any of the positive content of his
political theory. they were intended, not as final expositions of his
point of view, but as partial and preliminary studies, in which his aim
was far more destructive than constructive. it is clear that in first
conceiving the plan of a [[work]] on _political institutions_, rousseau
cannot have meant to regard all [[society]] as in essence [[bad]]. it is indeed
evident that he meant, from the first, to study [[human]] [[society]] and
institutions in their [[rational]] aspect, and that he was rather diverted
from his main [[purpose]] by the academy of dijon's competition than first
induced by it to [[think]] about [[political]] questions [[question]]. it need, therefore,
cause no surprise that a [[work]] probably written before the _discourse on
inequality_ should contain the germs of the theory given in full in the
_social contract_. the _discourse on [[political]] economy_ is important as
giving the first sketch of the theory of the "general will." it will
readily be seen that [[rousseau]] does not mean by "political economy"
exactly what we mean nowadays. he begins with a discussion of the
fundamental [[nature]] of the [[state]], and the possibility of reconciling its
existence with [[human]] [[liberty]], and goes on with an admirable short study
of the principles [[principle]] of [[taxation]]. he is thinking throughout of "political"
in the sense of "public" economy, of the [[state]] as the [[public]] financier,
and not of the conditions governing industry. he conceives the state
as a [[body]] aiming at the well-being of all its members and subordinates
all his views of [[taxation]] to that end. he who has only necessaries
should not be taxed at all; superfluities should be supertaxed; there
should be heavy imposts on every sort of luxury. the first part of
the article is still more interesting. [[rousseau]] begins by demolishing
the exaggerated parallel so often drawn between the [[state]] and the
family; he shows that the [[state]] is not, and cannot be, patriarchal in
nature, and goes on to lay down his view that its real being consists
in the general will of its members. the essential features of the
_social contract_ are [[present]] in this discourse almost as if they were
commonplaces, certainly not as if they were new discoveries on which
the author had just hit by some [[happy]] inspiration. there is every
temptation, after reading the _political economy_, to suppose that
rousseau's [[political]] ideas [[idea]] really reached maturity far earlier than has
generally been allowed.

the _social contract_ finally appeared, along with _emile_, in 1762.
this year, therefore, represents in every [[respect]] the culmination of
rousseau's [[career]]. henceforth, he was to write only controversial
and confessional works [[work]]; his theories were now developed, and,
simultaneously, he gave to the [[world]] his views on the fundamental
problems of [[politics]] and [[education]]. it is now [[time]] to ask what
rousseau's [[system]], in its maturity, finally amounted to. the _social
contract_ contains practically the whole of his constructive political
theory; it requires to be [[read]], for full understanding, in connection
with his other works [[work]], especially _emile_ and the _letters on the mount_
(1764), but in the main it is self-contained and complete. the title
sufficiently defines its scope. it is called _the social contract
or principles [[principle]] of [[political]] right_, and the second title explains
the first. rousseau's object is not to deal, in a general way, like
montesquieu, with the actual [[institutions]] of existing states, but to
lay down the essential principles [[principle]] which must form the basis of every
legitimate [[society]]. [[rousseau]] himself, in the fifth [[book]] of the _emile_,
has stated the difference clearly. "montesquieu," he says, "did not
intend to treat of the principles [[principle]] of [[political]] [[right]]; he was content
to treat of the positive [[right]] (or law) of established governments [[government]];
and no two studies could be more different than these." [[rousseau]] then
conceives his object as being something very different from that of
the _spirit of the laws_, and it is a wilful error to misconstrue
his [[purpose]]. when he remarks that "the facts [[fact]]," the actual [[history]] of
political societies [[society]], "do not concern him," he is not contemptuous of
facts; he is merely asserting the sure [[principle]] that a [[fact]] can in
no case give rise to a [[right]]. his [[desire]] is to establish [[society]] on a
basis of pure [[right]], so as at once to disprove his attack on society
generally and to reinforce his criticism of existing societies [[society]].

round this point centres the whole dispute about the methods proper
to [[political]] theory. there are, broadly speaking, two schools of
political theorists, if we set aside the psychologists. one school, by
collecting facts [[fact]], aims at reaching broad generalisations about what
actually happens in [[human]] societies! the other tries to penetrate to
the universal principles [[principle]] at the root of all [[human]] combination. for the
latter [[purpose]] facts [[fact]] may be useful, but in themselves they can prove
nothing. the [[question]] is not one of [[fact]], but one of [[right]].

rousseau belongs essentially to this philosophical school. he is not,
as his less philosophic critics seem to suppose, a purely abstract
thinker generalising from imaginary historical instances; he is a
concrete thinker trying to get beyond they inessential and changing to
the permanent and invariable basis of [[human]] [[society]]. like green, he is
in search of the [[principle]] of [[political]] obligation, and beside this
quest all others fall into their place as secondary and derivative.
it is required to find a form of association able to defend and
protect with the whole [[common]] [[force]] the [[person]] and goods [[good]] of every
associate, and of such a [[nature]], that each, uniting himself with all,
may still obey only himself, and remain as [[free]] as before. this is
the fundamental problem of which the _social contract_ provides the
solution. the problem of [[political]] obligation is seen as including
all other [[political]] problems, which fall into place in a [[system]] based
upon it. how, [[rousseau]] asks, can the will of the [[state]] [[help]] being for
me a merely external will, imposing itself upon my own? how can the
existence of the [[state]] be reconciled with [[human]] [[freedom]]? how can [[man]],
who is born [[free]], rightly come to be everywhere in chains?

no-one could [[help]] understanding the central problem of the _social
contract_ immediately, were it not that its doctrines often seem
to be strangely formulated. we have seen that this strangeness is
due to rousseau's historical position, to his use of the political
concepts current in his own [[age]], and to his [[natural]] tendency to build
on the foundations laid by his predecessors. there are a [[great]] many
people whose [[idea]] of [[rousseau]] consists solely of the first words of
the opening [[chapter]] of the _social contract_, "man is born [[free]], and
everywhere he is in chains." but, they tell you, [[man]] is not born [[free]],
even if he is everywhere in chains. thus at the very outset we are
faced with the [[great]] difficulty in appreciating [[rousseau]]. when we
should naturally say "man ought to be [[free]]," or perhaps "man is born
for [[freedom]]," he prefers to say "man is born [[free]]," by which he means
exactly the same thing. there is doubtless, in his way of putting it,
an appeal to a "golden age"; but this golden [[age]] is admittedly as
imaginary as the [[freedom]] to which [[men]] are born is bound, for most of
them, to be. elsewhere [[rousseau]] puts the point much as we might put
it ourselves. "nothing is more [[certain]] than that every [[man]] born in
slavery is born for [[slavery]].... but if there are slaves [[slave]] by [[nature]], it
is because there have been slaves [[slave]] against nature" (_social contract_,
book i, chap. ii).

we have seen that the contrast between the "state of nature" and the
"state of society" runs through all rousseau's [[work]]. the _emile_
is a plea for "natural" [[education]]; the discourses are a plea for a
"naturalisation" of [[society]]; the _new héloïse_ is the romantic's
appeal for more "nature" in [[human]] relationships. what then is the
position of this contrast in rousseau's mature [[political]] [[thought]]? it
is clear that the position is not merely that of the discourses. in
them, he envisaged only the faults [[fault]] of actual societies [[society]]; now, he is
concerned with the possibility of a [[rational]] [[society]]. his aim is to
justify the [[change]] from "nature" to "society," although it has left
men in chains. he is in search of the true [[society]], which leaves men
"as [[free]] as before." altogether, the space occupied by the [[idea]] of
nature in the _social contract_ is very small. it is used of necessity
in the controversial chapters [[chapter]], in which [[rousseau]] is refuting false
theories of social obligation; but when once he has brushed aside
the false prophets [[prophet]], he lets the [[idea]] of [[nature]] go with them, and
concerns himself solely with giving [[society]] the [[rational]] sanction he
has promised. it becomes clear that, in [[political]] matters at any rate,
the "state of nature" is for him only a term of controversy. he has
in effect abandoned, in so far as he ever held it, the theory of a
human golden [[age]]; and where, as in the _emile_, he makes use of the
idea of [[nature]], it is broadened and deepened out of all recognition.
despite many passages in which the old terminology cleaves to him, he
means by "nature" in this period not the original [[state]] of a thing,
nor even its reduction to the simplest terms: he is passing over to
the conception of "nature" as identical with the full [[development]] of
capacity, with the higher! [[idea]] of [[human]] [[freedom]]. this view may be seen
in germ even in the _discourse on inequality_, where, distinguishing
self-respect (_amour de soi_) from egoism (_amour-propre_), rousseau
makes the former, the [[property]] of the "natural" [[man]], consist not in
the [[desire]] for self-aggrandisement, but in the seeking of satisfaction
for reasonable [[desire]] accompanied by benevolence; whereas egoism is
the preference of our own interests to those of others, self-respect
merely puts us on an [[equal]] footing with our fellows. it is true that
in the discourse [[rousseau]] is pleading against the [[development]] of many
human faculties; but he is equally advocating the fullest development
of those he regards as "natural," by which he means merely "good."
the "state of [[society]]," as envisaged in the _social contract_, is no
longer in contradiction to the "state of nature" upheld in the _emile_,
where indeed the social environment is of the [[greatest]] importance, and,
though the pupil is screened from it, he is none the less being trained
for it. indeed the views given in the _social contract_ are summarised
in the fifth [[book]] of the _emile_, and by this summary the essential
unity of rousseau's [[system]] is emphasised.

rousseau's object, then, in the first words of the _social contract_,
"is to inquire if, in the civil order, there can be any sure and
certain, [[rule]] of administration, taking [[men]] as they are and laws [[law]] as
they might be." montesquieu took laws [[law]] as they were, and saw what sort
of [[men]] they made: [[rousseau]], founding his whole [[system]] on [[human]] [[freedom]],
takes [[man]] as the basis, and regards him as giving himself what laws [[law]] he
pleases. he takes his stand on the [[nature]] of [[human]] [[freedom]]: on this he
bases his whole [[system]], making the will of the members the sole basis
of every [[society]].

in working out his theory, [[rousseau]] makes use throughout of three
general and, to some extent, alternative conceptions. these are the
social contract, sovereignty and the general will. we shall now have to
examine each of these in turn.

the social contract theory is as old as the sophists of greece (see
plato, _republic_, [[book]] ii and the _gorgias_), and as i elusive.
it has been adapted to the most opposite points of view, and used,
in different forms, on both sides of every [[question]] to which it
could conceivably be applied. it is frequent in mediæval writers,
a commonplace with the theorists of the renaissance, and in the
eighteenth century already nearing its fall before a wider conception.
it would be a long, as well as a thankless, task to trace its history
over again: it may be followed [[best]] in d. g. ritchie's admirable essay
on it in _darwin and hegel and other studies_. for us, it is important
only to regard it in its most general aspect, before studying the
special use made of it by [[rousseau]]. obviously, in one form or another,
it is a theory very easily arrived at. wherever any form of government
apart from the merest [[tyranny]] exists, reflection on the basis of the
state cannot but lead to the notion that, in one sense or another,
it is based on the [[consent]], tacit or expressed, [[past]] or [[present]], of
its members. in this alone, the greater part of the social contract
theory is already latent. add the [[desire]] to find actual justification
for a theory in facts [[fact]], and, especially in an [[age]] possessed only of the
haziest historical sense, this doctrine of [[consent]] will inevitably
be given a historical setting. if in addition there is a tendency
to regard [[society]] as something unnatural to [[humanity]], the tendency
will become irresistible. by writers of almost all schools, the
state will be represented as having arisen, in some remote [[age]], out
of a compact or, in more legal phrase, contract between two or more
parties. the only class that will be able to resist the doctrine is
that which maintains the [[divine]] [[right]] of kings [[king]], and holds that all
existing governments [[government]] were were imposed on the [[people]] by the direct
interposition of [[god]]. all who are not prepared to maintain that will be
partisans of some form or other of the social contract theory.

it is, therefore, not surprising that we find among its advocates
writers of the most opposite points of view. barely stated, it is a
mere formula, which may be filled in with any content from absolutism
to pure republicanism. and, in the hands of some at least of its
supporters, it turns out to be a weapon that cuts both ways. we shall
be in a [[better]] position to [[judge]] of its usefulness when we have seen
its [[chief]] varieties at [[work]].

all social contract theories that are at all definite fall under one
or other of two heads. they represent [[society]] as based on an original
contract either between the [[people]] and the [[government]], or between all
the individuals [[individual]] composing the [[state]]. historically, [[modern]] theory passes
from the first to the second of these forms.

the doctrine that [[society]] is founded on a contract between the people
and the [[government]] is of mediæval origin. it was often supported by
references to the old testament, which contains a similar view in
an unreflective form. it is found in most of the [[great]] political
writers of the sixteenth century; in buchanan, and in the writings
of james i: it persists into the seventeenth in the works [[work]] of grotius
and puffendorf. grotius is sometimes held to have stated the theory
so as to admit both forms of contract; but it is clear that he is
only thinking of the first form as admitting democratic as well as
monarchical [[government]]. we find it put very clearly by the convention
parliament of 1688, which accuses james ii of having "endeavoured
to subvert the [[constitution]] of the [[kingdom]] by breaking the original
contract between [[king]] and [[people]]." while hobbes, on the side of the
royalists, is maintaining the contract theory in its second form, the
parliamentarian algernon sidney adheres to the [[idea]] of a contract
between the [[people]] and the [[government]].

in this form, the theory clearly admits of opposite interpretations. it
may be held that the [[people]], having given itself up once for all to its
rulers, has nothing more to ask of them, and is bound to submit to any
usage they may choose to inflict. this, however, is not the implication
most usually drawn from it. the theory, in this form, originated with
theologians who were also lawyers. their view of a contract implied
mutual obligations; they regarded the ruler as bound, by its terms,
to govern constitutionally. the old [[idea]] that a [[king]] must not violate
the [[sacred]] customs of the realm passes easily into the doctrine that he
must not violate the terms of the original contract between himself and
his [[people]]. just as in the days of the norman kings [[king]], every appeal on
the part of the [[people]] for more liberties [[liberty]] was couched in the form of a
demand that the customs of the "good old times" of edward the confessor
should be respected, so in the seventeenth century every act of popular
assertion or [[resistance]] was stated as an appeal to the [[king]] not to
violate the contract. the demand was a [[good]] popular cry, and it seemed
to have the theorists behind it. [[rousseau]] gives his refutation of this
view, which he had, in the _discourse on inequality_, maintained in
passing, in the sixteenth [[chapter]] of the third [[book]] of the _social
contract._ (see also [[book]] i, chap, iv, init.) his attack is really
concerned also with the theory of hobbes, which in some respects
resembles, as we shall see, this first view; but, in form at least,
it is directed against this form of contract. it will be possible to
examine it more closely, when the second view has been considered.

the second view, which may be called the social contract theory proper,
regards [[society]] as originating in, or based on, an agreement between
the individuals [[individual]] composing it. it seems to be found first, rather
vaguely, in richard hooker's _ecclesiastical polity_, from which locke
largely borrowed: and it reappears, in varying forms, in milton's
_tenure of kings [[king]] and magistrates_, in hobbes's _leviathan_, in locke's
_treatises on civil government_, and in [[rousseau]]. the best-known
instance of its actual use is by the pilgrim fathers [[father]] on the _mayflower_
in 1620, in whose declaration occurs the phrase, "we do solemnly and
mutually, in the presence of [[god]] and of one another, covenant and
combine ourselves together into a civil [[body]] [[politic]]." the natural
implication of this view would seem to be the corollary of complete
popular sovereignty which [[rousseau]] draws. but before rousseau's time
it had been used to support views as diverse as those which rested on
the first form. we saw that, in grotius's [[great]] [[work]], _de jure belli et
pacis_, it was already possible to [[doubt]] which of the two theories was
being advocated. the first theory was, historically, a means of popular
protest against [[royal]] aggression. as soon as popular [[government]] was
taken into account, the act of contract between [[people]] and government
became in effect merely a contract between the individuals [[individual]] composing
the [[society]], and readily passed over into the second form.

the second theory, in its ordinary form, expresses only the view
that the [[people]] is everywhere [[sovereign]], and that, in the phrase
of milton's treatise, "the [[power]] of kings [[king]] and magistrates is only
derivative." before, however, this view had been worked up into a
philosophical theory, it had already been used by hobbes to support
precisely opposite principles [[principle]]. hobbes agrees that the original contract
is one between all the individuals [[individual]] composing the [[state]], and that the
government is no party to it; but he regards the [[people]] as agreeing,
not merely to form a [[state]], but to invest a [[certain]] [[person]] or certain
persons with the [[government]] of it. he agrees that the [[people]] is
naturally supreme, but regards it as alienating its sovereignty by
the contract itself, and delegating its [[power]], wholly and for ever,
to the [[government]]. as soon, therefore, as the [[state]] is set up, the
government becomes for hobbes the [[sovereign]]; there is no more question
of popular sovereignty, but only of passive [[obedience]]: the [[people]] is
bound, by the contract, to obey its ruler, no matter whether he governs
well or ill. it has alienated all its rights [[right]] to the [[sovereign]], who is,
therefore, absolute master. hobbes, living in a [[time]] of civil wars [[war]],
regards the worst [[government]] as [[better]] than [[anarchy]], and is, therefore,
at pains [[pain]] to find arguments in support of any form of absolutism. it is
easy to pick holes in this [[system]], and to see into what difficulties
a conscientious hobbist might be [[led]] by a [[revolution]]. for as soon as
the revolutionaries get the upper hand, he will have to [[sacrifice]] one
of his principles [[principle]]: he will have to side against either the actual or
the legitimate [[sovereign]]. it is easy also to see that alienation of
liberty, even if possible for an [[individual]], which [[rousseau]] denies,
cannot bind his [[posterity]]. but, with all its faults [[fault]], the view of hobbes
is on the whole admirably, if ruthlessly, logical, and to it rousseau
owes a [[great]] deal.

the special shape given to the second social contract theory by hobbes
looks, at first sight, much like a combination, into a [[single]] act,
of both the contracts. this, however, is not the view he adopts. the
theory of a contract between [[government]] and [[people]] had, as we have
seen, been used mainly as a support for popular liberties [[liberty]], a means of
assertion against the [[government]]. hobbes, whose whole aim is to make
his [[government]] [[sovereign]], can only do this by leaving the government
outside the contract: he thus avoids the necessity of submitting it to
any obligation whatsoever, and leaves it absolute and irresponsible. he
secures, in [[fact]], not merely a [[state]] which has unbounded rights [[right]] against
the [[individual]], but a determinate [[authority]] with the [[right]] to enforce
those rights [[right]]. his theory is not merely statism (_étatisme_); it is pure
despotism.

it is clear that, if such a theory is to be upheld, it can stand only
by the view, which hobbes shares with grotius, that a [[man]] can alienate
not merely his own [[liberty]], but also that of his descendants, and
that, consequently, a [[people]] as a whole can do the same. this is the
point at which both locke and [[rousseau]] attack it. locke, whose aim is
largely to justify the [[revolution]] of 1688, makes [[government]] depend,
not merely at its institution, but always, on the [[consent]] of the
governed, and regards all rulers as liable to be displaced if they
govern tyrannically. he omits, however, to provide any machinery short
of [[revolution]] for the expression of popular [[opinion]], and, on the whole,
seems to regard the popular [[consent]] as something essentially tacit and
assumed. he regards the [[state]] as existing mainly to [[protect]] [[life]] and
property, and is, in all his assertions of popular rights [[right]], so cautious
as to reduce them almost to nothing. it is not till we come to rousseau
that the second form of the contract theory is stated in its purest and
most logical form.

rousseau sees clearly the necessity, if popular [[consent]] in government
is to be more than a name, of giving it some constitutional means of
expression. for locke's theory of tacit [[consent]], he substitutes an
active agreement periodically renewed. he looks back with admiration
to the city-states of ancient greece and, in his own day, reserves
his admiration for the swiss [[free]] cities [[city]], berne and, above all,
geneva, his native place. seeing in the [[europe]] of his day no case in
which representative [[government]] was working at all democratically,
he was unable to conceive that means might be found of giving effect
to this active agreement in a nation-state; he therefore held that
self-government was impossible except for a [[city]]. he wished to break up
the nation-states of [[europe]], and create instead federative leagues of
independent city-states.

it matters, however, comparatively little, for the appreciation of
rousseau's [[political]] theory in general, that he failed to become the
theorist of the [[modern]] [[state]]. by taking the [[state]], which must have,
in essentials, everywhere the same basis, at its simplest, he was
able, far [[better]] than his predecessors, to bring out the real nature
of the "social tie," an alternative name which he often uses for
the social contract. his doctrine i of the underlying [[principle]] of
political obligation is that of all [[great]] [[modern]] writers, from kant to
mr. bosanquet. this fundamental unity has been obscured only because
critics have failed to put the social contract theory in its proper
place in rousseau's [[system]].

this theory was, we have seen, a commonplace. the amount of historical
authenticity assigned to the contract almost universally presupposed
varied enormously. generally, the weaker a writer's [[rational]] basis,
the more he appealed to history--and [[invented]] it. it was, therefore,
almost inevitable that [[rousseau]] should cast his theory into the
contractual form. there were, indeed, writers of his [[time]] who laughed
at the contract, but they were not writers who constructed a general
system of [[political]] [[philosophy]]. from cromwell to montesquieu and
bentham, it was the practically minded [[man]], impatient of unactual
hypotheses, who refused to accept the [[idea]] of contract. the theorists
were as unanimous in its favour as the victorians were in favour of
the "organic" theory. but we, criticising them in the [[light]] of later
events, are in a [[better]] position for estimating the position the
social contract really took in their [[political]] [[system]]. we see that
locke's doctrine of tacit [[consent]] made popular control so unreal that
he was forced, if the [[state]] was to have any hold, to make his contract
historical and actual, binding [[posterity]] for all [[time]], and that he was
also [[led]] to admit a quasi-contract between [[people]] and [[government]], as a
second vindication of popular liberties [[liberty]]. [[rousseau]], on the other hand,
bases no vital argument on the historical [[nature]] of the contract, in
which, indeed, he clearly does not [[believe]]. "how," he asks, "did this
change [from [[nature]] to society] come about?" and he answers [[answer]] that he
does not [[know]]. moreover, his aim is to find "a sure and legitimate rule
of administration, taking [[men]] as they are and laws [[law]] as they might be";
that is to say, his social contract is something which will be found
at [[work]] in every legitimate [[society]], but which will be in abeyance in
all forms of despotism. he clearly means by it no more and no less than
the fundamental [[principle]] of [[political]] association, the basis of the
unity which enables us, in the [[state]], to realise [[political]] [[liberty]] by
giving up lawlessness and license. the presentation of this doctrine
in the quasi-historical form of the social contract theory is due to
the accident of the [[time]] and place in which [[rousseau]] wrote. at the same
time, the importance of the conception is [[best]] to be seen in the hard
death it dies. though no-one, for a hundred years or so, has thought
of regarding it as historical, it has been found so hard to secure
any other phrase explaining as well or [[better]] the basis of political
union that, to this day, the phraseology of the contract theory largely
persists. a conception so vital cannot have been barren.

it is indeed, in rousseau's own [[thought]], only one of the three
different ways in which the basis of [[political]] union is stated,
according to the preoccupation of his [[mind]]. when he is thinking
quasi-historically, he describes his doctrine as that of the social
contract. [[modern]] anthropology, in its attempts to explain the complex
by means of the simple, often strays further from the straight paths
of [[history]] and [[reason]]. in a semi-legal aspect, using the terminology,
if not the standpoint, of jurisprudence, he restates the same doctrine
in the form of popular sovereignty. this use tends continually to pass
over into the more philosophical form which comes third. "sovereignty
is the exercise of the general will." philosophically, rousseau's
doctrine finds its expression in the view that the [[state]] is based
not on any original convention, not on, any determinate [[power]], but
on the living and sustaining [[rational]] will of its members. we have
now to examine first sovereignty and then the general will, which is
ultimately rousseau's guiding conception.

sovereignty is, first and foremost, a legal term, and it has often been
held that its use in [[political]] [[philosophy]] merely leads to confusion. in
jurisprudence, we are told, it has the perfectly plain meaning given
to it in austin's famous definition. the [[sovereign]] is "a _determinate_
human superior, _not_ in a habit of [[obedience]] to a like superior, but
receiving _habitual_ [[obedience]] from the _bulk_ of a given [[society]]."
where sovereignty is placed is, on this view, a [[question]] purely of
fact, and never of [[right]]. we have only to seek out the determinate
human superior in a given [[society]], and we shall have the [[sovereign]]. in
answer to this theory, it is not enough, though it is a valuable point,
to show that such a determinate superior is rarely to be found. where,
for instance, is the [[sovereign]] of [[england]] or of the british [[empire]]? is
it the [[king]], who is called the [[sovereign]]? or is it the [[parliament]],
which is the legislature (for austin's [[sovereign]] is regarded as the
source of law)? or is it the electorate, or the whole mass of the
population, with or without the [[right]] of voting? clearly all these
exercise a [[certain]] influence in the making of laws [[law]]. or finally, is it
now the cabinet? for austin, one of these bodies [[body]] would be ruled out as
indeterminate (the mass of the population) and another as responsible
(the cabinet). but are we to regard the house of commons [[common]] or those who
elect it as forming part of the [[sovereign]]? the search for a determinate
sovereign may be a valuable legal conception; but it has evidently
nothing to do with [[political]] theory.

it is, therefore, essential to distinguish between the legal sovereign
of jurisprudence, and the [[political]] [[sovereign]] of [[political]] science
and [[philosophy]]. even so, it does not at once become clear what this
political [[sovereign]] may be. is it the [[body]] or bodies [[body]] of persons [[person]] in whom
political [[power]] in a [[state]] actually resides? is it merely the complex
of actual [[institutions]] regarded as embodying the will of the [[society]]?
this would leave us still in the realm of mere [[fact]], outside both right
and [[philosophy]]. the [[sovereign]], in the philosophical sense, is neither
the nominal [[sovereign]], nor the legal [[sovereign]], nor the political
sovereign of [[fact]] and [[common]] sense: it is the consequence of the
fundamental bond of union, the restatement of the doctrine of social
contract, the foreshadowing of that of general will. the sovereign
is that [[body]] in the [[state]] in which [[political]] _power ought_ always to
reside, and in which the _right_ to such [[power]] _does_ always reside.

the [[idea]] at the back of the philosophical conception of sovereignty
is, therefore, essentially the same as that we found to underlie the
social contract theory. it is the view that the [[people]], whether it
can alienate its [[right]] or not, is the ultimate director of its own
destinies, the final [[power]] from which there is no appeal. in a sense,
this is recognised even by hobbes, who makes the [[power]] of his absolute
sovereign, the predecessor of austin's "determinate [[human]] superior,"
issue first of all from the social contract, which is essentially a
popular act. the difference between hobbes and [[rousseau]] on this point
is solely that [[rousseau]] regards as inalienable a supreme [[power]] which
hobbes makes the [[people]] alienate in its first corporate action. that
is to say, hobbes in [[fact]] accepts the theory of popular [[supremacy]] in
name only to [[destroy]] it in [[fact]]; [[rousseau]] asserts the theory in its
only logical form, and is under no temptation to evade it by means of
false historical assumptions. in locke, a distinction is already drawn
between the legal and the actual [[sovereign]], which locke calls "supreme
power"; [[rousseau]] unites the absolute sovereignty of hobbes and the
"popular consent" of locke into the philosophic doctrine of popular
sovereignty, which has since been the established form of the theory.
his final view represents a return from the perversions of hobbes to
a doctrine already familiar to mediæval and renaissance writers; but
it is not merely a return. in its passage the view has fallen into its
place in a complete [[system]] of [[political]] [[philosophy]].

in a second important [[respect]] [[rousseau]] differentiates himself from
hobbes. for hobbes, the [[sovereign]] is identical with the [[government]].
he is so hot for absolutism largely because he regards [[revolution]],
the overthrow of the existing [[government]], as at the same [[time]] the
dissolution of the [[body]] [[politic]], and a return to complete [[anarchy]] or to
the "state of [[nature]]." [[rousseau]] and, to some extent, locke meet this
view by sharp division between the supreme [[power]] and the [[government]].
for [[rousseau]], they are so clearly distinct that even a completely
democratic [[government]] is not at the same [[time]] the [[sovereign]]; its
members are [[sovereign]] only in a different capacity and as a different
corporate [[body]], just as two different societies [[society]] may [[exist]] for different
purposes with exactly the same members. pure [[democracy]], however, the
government of the [[state]] by all the [[people]] in every detail, is not,
as [[rousseau]] says, a possible [[human]] institution. all governments [[government]] are
really _mixed_ in [[character]]; and what we call a [[democracy]] is only a
more or less democratic [[government]]. [[government]], therefore, will always
be to some extent in the hands of selected persons [[person]]. sovereignty, on
the other hand, is in his view absolute, inalienable, indivisible, and
indestructible. it cannot be limited, abandoned, shared or destroyed.
it is an essential part of all social [[life]] that the [[right]] to control
the destinies of the [[state]] belongs in the [[last]] resort to the whole
people. there clearly must in the end be somewhere in the [[society]] an
ultimate court of appeal, whether determinate or not; but, unless
sovereignty is distinguished from [[government]], the [[government]], passing
under the name of [[sovereign]], will inevitably be regarded as absolute.
the only way to avoid the conclusions of hobbes is, therefore, to
establish a clear separation between them.

rousseau tries to do this by an adaptation of the doctrine of the
"three powers [[power]]." but instead of three independent powers [[power]] sharing the
supreme [[authority]], he gives only two, and makes one of these wholly
dependent on the other. he substitutes for the co-ordination of the
legislative, the executive, and the judicial authorities [[authority]], a system
in which the legislative [[power]], or [[sovereign]], is always supreme, the
executive, or [[government]], always secondary and derivative, and the
judicial [[power]] merely a function of [[government]]. this division he makes,
naturally, one of _will_ and _power_. the [[government]] is merely to carry
out the decrees, or acts of will, of the [[sovereign]] [[people]]. just as
the [[human]] will transfers a command to its members for execution, so
the [[body]] [[politic]] may give its decisions [[force]] by setting up authority
which, like the brain, may command its members. in delegating the power
necessary for the execution of its will, it is abandoning none of its
supreme [[authority]]. it remains [[sovereign]], and can at any moment recall
the grants it has made. [[government]], therefore, exists only at the
sovereign's [[pleasure]], and is always revocable by the [[sovereign]] will.

it will be seen, when we come to discuss the [[nature]] of the general
will, that this doctrine really contains the most valuable part of
rousseau's theory. here, we are concerned rather with its limitations.
the distinction between legislative and executive functions is
in practice very hard to draw. in rousseau's case, it is further
complicated by the presence of a second distinction. the legislative
power, the [[sovereign]], is concerned only with what is general, the
executive only with what is particular. this distinction, the full
force of which can only be seen in connection with the general will,
means roughly that a matter is general when it concerns the whole
community equally, and makes no mention of any particular class; as
soon as it refers to any class or [[person]], it becomes particular, and
can no longer form the [[subject]] matter of an act of sovereignty. however
just this distinction may seem in the abstract, it is clear that its
effect is to place all the [[power]] in the hands of the executive: modern
legislation is almost always concerned with particular classes and
interests. it is not, therefore, a long step from the view of rousseau
to the [[modern]] theory of democratic [[government]], in which the [[people]] has
little [[power]] beyond that of removing its rulers if they displease it.
as long, however, as we confine our view to the city-state of which
rousseau is thinking, his distinction is capable of preserving for the
people a greater actual exercise of will. a [[city]] can often generalise
where a nation must particularise.

it is in the third [[book]] of the _social contract_, where [[rousseau]] is
discussing the problem of [[government]], that it is most essential to
remember that his discussion has in view mainly the city-state and
not the nation. broadly put, his [[principle]] of [[government]] is that
democracy is possible only in small states, [[aristocracy]] in those of
medium extent, and [[monarchy]] in [[great]] states (book iii, chap. iii).
in considering this view, we have to take into account two things.
first, he rejects representative [[government]]; will being, in his
theory, inalienable, representative sovereignty is impossible. but, as
he regards all general acts as functions of sovereignty, this means
that no general act can be within the competence of a representative
assembly. in judging this theory, we must take into account all the
circumstances of rousseau's [[time]]. [[france]], geneva and [[england]] were the
three states he took most into account. in [[france]], representative
government was practically non-existent; in geneva, it was only
partially necessary; in [[england]], it was a mockery, used to support a
corrupt [[oligarchy]] against a debased [[monarchy]]. [[rousseau]] may well be
pardoned for not taking the ordinary [[modern]] view of it. nor indeed is
it, even in the [[modern]] [[world]], so satisfactory an instrument of the
popular will that we can afford wholly to discard his criticism. it is
one of the problems of the day to find some means of securing effective
popular control over a weakened [[parliament]] and a despotic cabinet.

the second factor is the immense [[development]] of local [[government]].
it seemed to [[rousseau]] that, in the nation-state, all [[authority]] must
necessarily pass, as it had in [[france]], to the central [[power]]. devolution
was hardly dreamed of; and [[rousseau]] saw the only means of securing
effective popular [[government]] in a federal [[system]], starting from
the small unit as [[sovereign]]. the nineteenth century has proved the
falsehood of much of his theory of [[government]]; but there are still
many [[wise]] comments and fruitful suggestions to be found in the third
book of the _social contract_ and in the treatise on the _government
of poland_, as well as in his adaptation and criticism of the
_polysynodie_ of the abbé de saint-pierre, a scheme of local government
for [[france]], born out of its due [[time]].

the point in rousseau's theory of sovereignty that offers most
difficulty is his view (book ii, chap, vii) that, for every [[state]],
a _legislator_ is necessary. we shall [[understand]] the section only
by realising that the legislator is, in [[fact]], in rousseau's [[system]],
the spirit of [[institutions]] personified; his place, in a developed
society, is taken by the whole complex of social custom, organisation
and tradition that has grown up with the [[state]]. this is made clearer
by the [[fact]] that the legislator is not to exercise legislative [[power]];
he is merely to submit his suggestions for popular approval. thus
rousseau recognises that, in the case of [[institutions]] and traditions as
elsewhere, will, and not [[force]], is the basis of the [[state]].

this may be seen in his treatment of [[law]] as a whole (book ii, chap,
vi), which deserves very careful attention. he defines laws [[law]] as "acts
of the general will," and, agreeing with montesquieu in making [[law]] the
"condition of civil association," goes beyond him only in tracing it
more definitely to its origin in an act of will. the social contract
renders [[law]] necessary, and at the same [[time]] makes it quite clear that
laws can proceed only from the [[body]] of [[citizens]] who have constituted
the [[state]]. "doubtless," says [[rousseau]], "there is a universal justice
emanating from [[reason]] alone; but this [[justice]], to be admitted among us,
must be mutual. humbly speaking, in default of [[natural]] sanctions, the
laws of [[justice]] are ineffective among [[men]]." of the [[law]] which set up
among [[men]] this reign of mutual [[justice]] the general will is the source.

we thus come at [[last]] to the general will, the most disputed, and
certainly the most fundamental, of all rousseau's [[political]] concepts.
no critic of the _social contract_ has found it easy to say either
what precisely its author meant by it, or what is its final value for
political [[philosophy]]. the difficulty is increased because rousseau
himself sometimes halts in the sense which he assigns to it, and even
seems to suggest by it two different ideas [[idea]]. of its broad meaning,
however, there can be no [[doubt]]. the effect of the social contract is
the creation of a new [[individual]]. when it has taken place, "at once,
in place of the [[individual]] personality of each contracting party, the
act of association creates a [[moral]] and collective [[body]], composed of as
many members as the assembly contains voters, and receiving from the
act its unity, its [[common]] identity (_moi commun_), its [[life]] and its
will" (book i, chap. vi). the same doctrine had been stated earlier,
in the _political economy_, without the historical setting. "the body
politic is also a [[moral]] being, possessed of a will, and this general
will, which tends always to the preservation and welfare of the whole
and of every part, and is the source of the laws [[law]], constitutes for all
the members of the [[state]], in their relations to one another and to it,
the [[rule]] of what is just or [[unjust]]." it will be seen at once that the
second statement, which could easily be fortified by others from the
_social contract_, says more than the first. it is not apparent that
the [[common]] will, created by the institution of [[society]], need "tend
always to the welfare of the whole." is not the [[common]] will at least as
fallible as the will of a [[single]] [[individual]]? may it not equally be led
away from its true interests to the pursuit of [[pleasure]] or of something
which is really harmful to it? and, if the whole [[society]] may vote what
conduces to the momentary [[pleasure]] of all the members and at the same
time to the lasting damage of the [[state]] as a whole, is it not still
more likely that some of the members will try to secure their private
interests in opposition to those of the whole and of others? all these
questions, and others like them, have been [[asked]] by critics of the
conception of the general will.

two main points are involved, to one of which [[rousseau]] gives a clear
and definite [[answer]]. "there is often," he says, "a [[great]] deal of
difference between the _will of all_ and the _general will_; the latter
takes account only of the [[common]] interest, while the former takes
private interest into account, and is no more than a sum of particular
wills." "the agreement of all interests is formed by opposition to that
of each" (book ii, chap. iii). it is indeed possible for a citizen,
when an issue is presented to him, to vote not for the [[good]] of the
state, but for his own [[good]]; but, in such a case, his vote, from the
point of view of the general will, is merely negligible. but "does it
follow that the general will is exterminated or corrupted? not at all:
it is always constant, unalterable, and pure; but it is subordinated
to other wills which encroach upon its sphere.... the [[fault]] [each
man] commits [in detaching his interest from the [[common]] interest] is
that of changing the [[state]] of the [[question]], and answering something
different from what he is [[asked]]. instead of saying by his vote 'it is
to the advantage of the [[state]],' he says, 'it is to the advantage of
this or that [[man]] or party that this or that view should prevail.' thus
the [[law]] of [[public]] order in assemblies is not so much to maintain in
them the general will as to secure that the [[question]] be always put
to it, and the [[answer]] always given by it" (book iv, chap. i). these
passages, with many others that may be found in the text, make it quite
clear that by the general will [[rousseau]] means something quite distinct
from the will of all, with which it should never have been confused.
the only excuse for such confusion lies [[lie]] in his view that when, _in a
city-state_, all particular associations are avoided, votes guided
by [[individual]] self-interest will always cancel one another, so that
majority voting will always result in the general will. this is clearly
not the case, and in this [[respect]] we may charge him with pushing the
democratic argument too far. the point, however, can be [[better]] dealt
with at a later stage. [[rousseau]] makes no pretence that the mere voice
of a majority is infallible; he only says, at the most, that, given his
ideal conditions, it would be so.

the second main point raised by critics of the general will is
whether in defining it as a will directed solely to the common
interest, [[rousseau]] means to exclude acts of [[public]] immorality and
short-sightedness. he answers [[answer]] the questions [[question]] in different ways. first,
an act of [[public]] immorality would be merely an unanimous instance
of selfishness, different in no particular, from similar acts less
unanimous, and therefore forming no part of a general will. secondly,
a mere ignorance of our own and the state's [[good]], entirely unprompted
by selfish desires [[desire]], does not make our will anti-social or [[individual]].
"the general will is always [[right]] and tends to the [[public]] advantage;
but it does not [[follow]] that the deliberations of the [[people]] are always
equally [[correct]]. our will is always for our own [[good]], but we do not
always see what that is: the [[people]] is never corrupted, but it is often
deceived, and on such occasions [[occasion]] only does it seem to will what is bad"
(book ii, chap. iii). it is impossible to acquit [[rousseau]] in some of
the passages in which he treats of the general will, of something worse
than obscurity--positive contradiction. it is probable, indeed, that
he never quite succeeded in getting his view clear in his own [[mind]];
there is nearly always, in his treatment of it, a [[certain]] amount of
muddle and fluctuation. these difficulties the student must be left to
worry out for himself; it is only possible to [[present]], in outline, what
rousseau meant to convey.

the treatment of the general will in the _political economy_ is brief
and lucid, and furnishes the [[best]] guide to his meaning. the definition
of it in this [[work]], which has already been quoted, is followed by
a short account of the [[nature]] of _general wills_ as a whole. "every
political [[society]] is composed of other smaller societies [[society]] of various
kinds, each of which has its interest and rules [[rule]] of conduct; but those
societies which everybody perceives, because they have an external
or authorised form, are not the only ones that actually [[exist]] in the
state: all individuals [[individual]] who are [[united]] by a [[common]] interest compose as
many others, either temporary or permanent, whose influence is none the
less real because it is less apparent.... the influence of all these
tacit or formal associations causes by the influence of their will as
many modifications of the [[public]] will. the will of these particular
societies has always two relations; for the members of the association,
it is a general will; for the [[great]] [[society]], it is a particular will;
and it is often [[right]] with regard to the first object and [[wrong]] as to
the second. the most general will is always the most just, and the
voice of the [[people]] is, in [[fact]], the voice of [[god]]."

the general will, [[rousseau]] continues in substance, is always for the
common [[good]]; but it is sometimes divided into smaller general wills,
which are [[wrong]] in relation to it. the [[supremacy]] of the [[great]] general
will is "the first [[principle]] of [[public]] economy and the fundamental
rule of [[government]]." in this passage, which differs only in clearness
and simplicity from others in the _social contract_ itself, it is easy
to see how far [[rousseau]] had in his [[mind]] a perfectly definite [[idea]].
every association of several persons [[person]] creates a new [[common]] will; every
association of a permanent [[character]] has already a "personality" of
its own, and in consequence a "general" will; the [[state]], the highest
known form of association, is a fully developed [[moral]] and collective
being with a [[common]] will which is, in the highest sense yet known to
us, general. all such wills are general only for the members of the
associations which exercise them; for outsiders, or rather for other
associations, they are purely particular wills. this applies even to
the [[state]]; "for, in relation to what is outside it, the [[state]] becomes
a simple being, an individual" (_social contract_, [[book]] i. chap. vii).
in [[certain]] passages in the _social contract_, in his criticism of
the abbé de saint-pierre's _project of perpetual peace_, and in the
second [[chapter]] of the original draft of the _social contract_, rousseau
takes into account the possibility of a still higher [[individual]], "the
federation of the [[world]]." in the _political economy_, thinking of the
nation-state, he affirms what in the _social contract_ (book ii, chap,
iii) he denies of the [[city]], and recognises that the [[life]] of a nation
is made up of the whole complex of its [[institutions]], and that the
existence of lesser general wills is not necessarily a menace to the
general will of the [[state]]. in the _social contract_, he only treats
of these lesser wills in relation to the [[government]], which, he shows,
has a will of its own, general for its members, but particular for
the [[state]] as a whole (book iii, chap. ii). this governmental will he
there prefers to call _corporate will_, and by this name it will be
convenient to distinguish the lesser general wills from the general
will of the [[state]] that is over them all.

so far, there is no [[great]] difficulty; but in discussing the
infallibility of the general will we are on more dangerous ground.
rousseau's treatment here clearly oscillates between regarding it
as a purely ideal conception, to which [[human]] [[institutions]] can only
approximate, and holding it to be realised actually in every republican
state, _i.e._ wherever the [[people]] is the [[sovereign]] in [[fact]] as well as
in [[right]]. [[book]] iv, chap, ii is the most startling passage expressing
the latter view. "when in the popular assembly a [[law]] is proposed, what
the [[people]] is [[asked]] is not exactly whether it accepts or rejects the
proposal, but whether it is in conformity with the general will, which
is its will.... when, therefore, the [[opinion]] that is contrary to my own
prevails, this proves neither more nor less than that i was mistaken,
and that what i [[thought]] to be the general will was not so." on his own
principles laid down elsewhere, [[rousseau]] would have to admit that it
proves nothing of the sort, except in so far as the other voters have
been guided by the general interest. though he sometimes affirms the
opposite, there is no security on his principles [[principle]] that the will of the
majority will be the general will. at the most it can only be said that
there is a greater [[chance]] of its being general than of the will of any
selected class of persons [[person]] not being [[led]] away by corporate interests.
the justification of [[democracy]] is not that it is always [[right]], even in
intention, but that it is more general than any other [[kind]] of supreme
power.

fundamentally, however, the doctrine of the general will is independent
of these contradictions. apart from kant's narrow and rigid [[logic]],
it is essentially one with his doctrine of the autonomy of the will.
kant takes rousseau's [[political]] theory, and applies it to ethics as a
whole. the germ of mis application is already found in rousseau's own
work; for he protests more than once against attempts to treat moral
and [[political]] [[philosophy]] apart, as distinct studies, and asserts their
absolute unity. this is brought out clearly in the _social contract_
(book i, chap, viii), where he is speaking of the [[change]] brought
about by the establishment of [[society]]. "the passage from the [[state]] of
nature to the civil [[state]] produces [[produce]] a very remarkable [[change]] in [[man]],
by substituting [[justice]] for instinct in his conduct, and giving his
actions the morality they had hitherto lacked.... what [[man]] loses by
the social contract is his [[natural]] [[liberty]] and an unlimited [[right]] to
everything he tries to get and succeeds in getting; what he gains is
civil [[liberty]] ... which is limited by the general will.... we might,
over and above all this, add to what [[man]] acquires in the civil state
_moral [[liberty]], which alone makes him truly master of himself; for the
mere impulse of appetite is [[slavery]], while [[obedience]] to a [[law]] which we
prescribe to ourselves is [[liberty]]._"

this one [[chapter]] contains the gist of the kantian [[moral]] [[philosophy]],
and makes it quite clear that [[rousseau]] perceived its application to
ethics as well as to [[politics]]. the morality of our acts consists in
their being directed in accordance with universal [[law]]; acts in which
we are guided merely by our [[passions]] are not [[moral]]. further, [[man]] can
only possess [[freedom]] when his whole being is unified in the pursuit of
a [[single]] end; and, as his whole being can be unified only in pursuit of
a [[rational]] end, which alone excludes contradiction, only [[moral]] acts,
only [[men]] directing their lives [[life]] by universal [[law]], are [[free]]. in kantian
language, the will is autonomous (_i.e._ prescribes to itself its own
law) only when it is directed to a universal end; when it is guided
by selfish [[passions]], or particular considerations, it is heteronomous
(_i.e._ receives its [[law]] from something external to itself), and in
bondage. [[rousseau]], as he says (book i, chap, viii), was not directly
concerned with the ethical sense of the word "liberty," and kant was,
therefore, left to develop the doctrine into a [[system]]; but the phrases
of this [[chapter]] prove false the view that the doctrine of a real will
arises first in connection with [[politics]], and is only transferred
thence to [[moral]] [[philosophy]]. [[rousseau]] bases his [[political]] doctrine
throughout on his view of [[human]] [[freedom]]; it is because [[man]] is a free
agent capable of being determined by a universal [[law]] prescribed by
himself that the [[state]] is in like manner capable of realising the
general will, that is, of prescribing to itself and its members a
similar universal [[law]].

the general will, then, is the application of [[human]] [[freedom]] to
political [[institutions]]. before the value of this conception can be
determined, there is a criticism to be met. the [[freedom]] which is
realised in the general will, we are told, is the [[freedom]] of the state
_as a whole_; but the [[state]] exists to secure _individual_ [[freedom]] for
its members. a [[free]] [[state]] may be [[tyrannical]]; a despot may allow his
subjects every [[freedom]]. what guarantee is there that the [[state]], in
freeing itself, will not enslave its members? this criticism has been
made with such regularity that it has to be answered in some detail.

"the problem is to find a form of association which will defend and
protect with the whole [[common]] [[force]] the [[person]] and goods [[good]] of each
associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still
obey himself alone, and remain as [[free]] as before." "the clauses of the
contract ... are everywhere the same and everywhere tacitly admitted
and recognised.... these clauses, properly understood, may be reduced
to one--the total alienation of each associate, together with all his
rights, to the whole [[community]]...; for, if the individuals [[individual]] retained
certain rights [[right]], as there would be no [[common]] superior to decide between
them and the [[public]], each, being on one point his own [[judge]], would ask
to be so on all, and the [[state]] of [[nature]] would continue" (book i, chap.
vi). [[rousseau]] sees clearly that it is impossible to place any limits
upon the [[power]] of the [[state]]; when the [[people]] combine into a [[state]], they
must in the end submit to be guided in all things by the will of the
effective majority. limited sovereignty is a contradiction in terms;
the [[sovereign]] has a [[right]] to all that [[reason]] allows it, and as soon as
reason demands that the [[state]] shall interfere, no appeal to individual
rights can be made. what is [[best]] for the [[state]] must be [[suffered]] by the
individual. this, however, is very far from meaning that the ruling
power ought, or has the [[moral]] [[right]], to interfere in every particular
case. [[rousseau]] has been subjected to much foolish criticism because,
after upholding the state's absolute [[supremacy]], he goes on (book ii,
chap, iv) to speak of "the limits of the [[sovereign]] [[power]]." there is no
contradiction whatsoever. wherever [[state]] intervention is for the [[best]],
the [[state]] has a [[right]] to intervene; but it has no [[moral]] [[right]], though
it must have a legal [[right]], to intervene where it is not for the [[best]].
the general will, being always in the [[right]], will intervene only when
intervention is proper. "the [[sovereign]]," therefore, "cannot impose upon
its subjects [[subject]] any fetters that are useless to the [[community]], nor can
it even [[wish]] to do so." as, however, the infallibility of the general
will is not enough to make the [[state]] infallible, there still remains
an objection. since the general will cannot always be arrived at, who
is to [[judge]] whether an act of intervention is justified? rousseau's
answer fails to satisfy many of his critics. "each [[man]] alienates, i
admit, by the social compact, only such part of his powers [[power]], goods [[good]] and
liberty as it is important for the [[community]] to control; but it must
also be granted that the [[sovereign]] is sole [[judge]] of what is important."
this, we are told, is mere [[state]] [[tyranny]] over again. but how is it
possible to avoid such a conclusion? [[rousseau]] has already given his
reasons for objecting to a limited sovereignty (book i, chap, vi): it
follows absolutely that we must take the [[best]] machinery we can find for
the execution of the state's functions. no [[doubt]] the machinery will
be imperfect; but we can only try to get as near the general will as
possible, without hoping to realise it fully.

the [[answer]], therefore, to the critics who hold that, in securing civil
liberty [[rousseau]] has sacrificed the [[individual]] may be put after this
fashion. [[liberty]] is not a merely negative conception; it does not
consist solely in the absence of restraint. the purest individualist,
herbert spencer for [[example]], would grant that a [[certain]] amount of
state interference is necessary to _secure_ [[liberty]]; but as soon as
this [[idea]] of securing [[liberty]] is admitted in the smallest [[degree]], the
whole [[idea]] has undergone profound modification. it can no longer be
claimed that every interference on the part of the [[state]] lessens the
liberty of the [[individual]]; the "liberty-fund" theory is as untenable
as that of the "wages-fund": the members of a [[state]] may be more free
when all are restrained from doing one another mutual damage than when
any one is left "free" to enslave another or be himself enslaved. this
principle once admitted, the precise amount of [[state]] interference that
is necessary to secure [[freedom]] will be always a matter for particular
discussion; every case must be decided on its own merits [[merit]], and, in
right, the [[sovereign]] will be omnipotent, or [[subject]] only to the [[law]] of
reason.

it has often been held that [[rousseau]] cannot really have inspired the
french [[revolution]] because this view is totally inconsistent with the
"rights of [[man]]," which the revolutionaries so fervently proclaimed.
if every [[right]] is alienated in the social contract, what sense can
there be in talking of "natural rights" afterwards? this, however, is
to misrepresent rousseau's position. the rights [[right]] of [[man]] as they are
preached by the [[modern]] individualist, are not the rights [[right]] of which
rousseau and the revolutionaries were thinking. we have seen that the
theory of the _social contract_ is founded on [[human]] [[freedom]]: this
freedom carries with it, in rousseau's view, the guarantee of its own
permanence; it is inalienable and indestructible. when, therefore,
government becomes despotic, it has no more [[right]] over its subjects
than the master has over his [[slave]] (book i, chap, iv); the [[question]] is
then purely one of might. in such cases, appeal may be made either to
the terms of the social contract, or, putting the same [[idea]] another
way, to the "natural right" of [[human]] [[freedom]]. this [[natural]] [[right]] is
in no sense inconsistent with the complete alienation supposed in the
contract; for the contract itself reposes on it and guarantees its
maintenance. the [[sovereign]] must, therefore, treat all its members
alike; but, so long as it does this, it remains omnipotent. if it
leaves the general for the particular, and treats one [[man]] [[better]] than
another, it ceases to be [[sovereign]]; but equality is already presupposed
in the terms of the contract.

it is more profitable to attack [[rousseau]] for his facile identification
of the interests of each of the [[citizens]] with those of all; but here,
too, most of the critics have abused their opportunity. he does not
maintain that there can be no opposition between a man's [[man]] particular
interests and the general will as [[present]] in him; on the contrary, he
explicitly and consistently affirms the presence of such opposition
(book i, chap. vii). what he asserts is, first, that the [[sovereign]], as
such, cannot have any interest contrary to the interest of the citizens
as a whole--that is obvious; and, secondly, that it cannot have an
interest contrary to that of any [[individual]]. the second point rousseau
proves by showing that the omnipotence of the [[sovereign]] is essential
to the preservation of [[society]], which in turn is necessary for the
individual. his argument, however, really rests on the fundamental
character of the general will. he would admit that, in any actual
state, the apparent interest of the many might often conflict with that
of the few; but he would contend that the _real_ interest of [[state]] and
individual alike, being [[subject]] to universal [[law]] could not be such as
to conflict with any other _real_ interest. the interest of the [[state]],
in so far as it is directed by the general will, must be the interest
of every [[individual]], in so far as he is guided by his _real_ will, that
is, in so far as he is acting universally, rationally and autonomously.

thus the justification of rousseau's theory of [[liberty]] returns to the
point from which it set out--the omnipotence of the _real will_ in
state and [[individual]]. it is in this sense that he speaks of [[man]] in the
state as "forced to be free" by the general will, much as kant might
speak of a man's [[man]] lower [[nature]] as forced to be [[free]] by the universal
mandate of his higher, more real and more [[rational]] will. it is in this
recognition of the [[state]] as a [[moral]] being, with powers [[power]] of determination
similar to the powers [[power]] of the [[individual]] [[mind]], that the significance
of the general will ultimately lies [[lie]]. even, however, among those who
have recognised its meaning, there are some who deny its value as a
conception of [[political]] [[philosophy]]. if, they say, the general will is
not the will of all, if it cannot be arrived at by a majority vote
or by any [[system]] of voting whatsoever, then it is nothing; it is a
mere abstraction, neither general, nor a i will. this is, of course,
precisely the criticism to which kant's "real will" is often subjected.
clearly, it must be granted at once that the general will does not
form the whole actual content of the will of every citizen. regarded
as actual, it must always be qualified by "in so far as" or its
equivalent. this, however, is so far from destroying the value of the
conception that therein lies [[lie]] its whole value. in seeking the universal
basis of [[society]], we are not seeking anything that is wholly actualised
in any [[state]], though we must be seeking something which exists, more or
less perfectly, in every [[state]].

the point of the social contract theory, as [[rousseau]] states it, is that
legitimate [[society]] exists by the [[consent]] of the [[people]], and acts by
popular will. active will, and not [[force]] or even mere [[consent]], is the
basis of the "republican" [[state]], which can only possess this character
because [[individual]] wills are not really self-sufficient and separate,
but complementary and inter-dependent. the [[answer]] to the [[question]] "why
ought i to obey the general will?" is that the general will exists in
me and not outside me. i am "obeying only myself," as [[rousseau]] says.
the [[state]] is not a mere accident of [[human]] [[history]], a mere device for
the protection of [[life]] and [[property]]; it responds to a fundamental need
of [[human]] [[nature]], and is rooted in the [[character]] of the individuals
who compose it. the whole complex of [[human]] [[institutions]] is not a mere
artificial structure; it is the expression of the mutual dependence
and fellowship of [[men]]. if it means anything, the theory of the general
will means that the [[state]] is [[natural]], and the "state of nature" an
abstraction. without this basis of will and [[natural]] need, no society
could for a moment subsist; the [[state]] exists and claims our obedience
because it is a [[natural]] extension of our personality.

the problem, however, still remains of making the general will, in
any particular [[state]], active and conscious. it is clear that there
are states in which visible and recognised [[institutions]] hardly answer
in any [[respect]] to its requirements. even in such states, however,
there is a limit to [[tyranny]]; deep down, in immemorial customs with
which the despot dare not interfere, the general will is still active
and important. it does not reside merely in the outward and visible
organisation of social [[institutions]], in that complex of formal
associations which we may call the [[state]]; its roots go deeper and its
branches spread further. it is realised, in greater or less [[degree]], in
the whole [[life]] of the [[community]], in the entire complex of private and
public relations which, in the widest sense, may be called [[society]]. we
may recognise it not only in a [[parliament]], a [[church]], a [[university]] or a
trade union, but also in the most intimate [[human]] relationships, and the
most trivial, as well as the most vital, social customs.

but, if all these things go to the making of the general will in every
community, the general will has, for [[politics]], primarily a narrower
sense. the problem here is to secure its [[supremacy]] in the official
institutions and [[public]] councils of the nation. this is the [[question]] to
which [[rousseau]] chiefly addressed himself. here, too, we shall find the
general will the [[best]] possible conception for the guidance of political
endeavour for the general will is realised not when that is done
which is [[best]] for the [[community]], but when, in addition, the community
as a whole has willed the doing of it. the general will demands not
only [[good]] [[government]], but also self-government--not only rational
conduct, but good-will. this is what some of rousseau's admirers are
apt to forget when they use his argument, as he himself was sometimes
inclined to use it, in support of pure [[aristocracy]]. [[rousseau]] said that
aristocracy was the [[best]] of all governments [[government]], but he said also that it
was the worst of all usurpers of sovereignty. nor must it be forgotten
that he expressly specified elective [[aristocracy]]. _there is no general
will unless the [[people]] wills the good_. general will may be embodied in
one [[man]] willing universally; but it can only be embodied in the state
when the mass of the [[citizens]] so wills. the will must be "general" in
two senses: in the sense in which [[rousseau]] used the word, it must be
general in its object, _i.e._ universal; but it must also be generally
held, _i.e._ [[common]] to all or to the majority.[1]

the general will is, then, above all a universal and, in the kantian
sense, a "rational" will. it would be possible to find in rousseau
many more anticipations of the views of kant; but it is [[better]] here
to confine comment to an important difference between them. it is
surprising to find in kant, the originator of [[modern]] "intellectualism,"
and in [[rousseau]], the [[great]] apostle of "sentiment," an essentially
similar view on the [[nature]] and function of the will. their views,
however, [[present]] a difference; for, whereas the moving [[force]] of kant's
moral imperative is purely "rational," [[rousseau]] finds the sanction of
his general will in [[human]] feeling itself. as we can see from a passage
in the original draft of the _social contract,_ the general will
remains purely [[rational]]. "no-one will dispute that the general will is
in each [[individual]] a pure act of the understanding, which reasons [[reason]] while
the [[passions]] are silent on what a [[man]] may demand of his neighbour and
on what his neighbour has a [[right]] to demand of him." the will remains
purely [[rational]], but [[rousseau]] feels [[feel]] that it needs an external motive
power. "if [[natural]] [[law]]," he writes, "were written only on the tablets
of [[human]] [[reason]] it would be incapable of guiding the greater part of
our actions; but it is also graven on the [[heart]] of [[man]] in characters
that cannot be effaced, and it is there it speaks to him more strongly
than all the precepts of the philosophers" (from an unfinished essay on
_the [[state]] of war_). the [[nature]] of this guiding sentiment is explained
in the _discourse on inequality_ (p. 197, note 2), where egoism
(_amour-propre_) is contrasted with self-respect (_amour de soi_).
naturally, [[rousseau]] holds, [[man]] does not want everything for himself,
and nothing for others. "egoism" and "altruism" are both one-sided
qualities arising out of the perversion of man's [[man]], "natural goodness."
"man is born [[good]]," that is, man's [[man]] [[nature]] really makes him [[desire]] only
to be treated as one among others, to share equally. this [[natural]] love
of equality (_amour de soi_) includes [[love]] of others as well as love
of [[self]], and egoism, loving one's [[self]] at the expense of others, is
an unnatural and perverted condition. the "rational" precepts of the
general will, therefore, find an echo in the [[heart]] of the "natural"
man, and, if we can only secure the [[human]] being against perversion by
existing societies [[society]], the general will can be made actual.

this is the meeting-point of rousseau's educational with his political
theory. his view as a whole can be [[studied]] only by taking together the
_social contract_ and the _emile_ as explained by the _letters on the
mount_ and other works [[work]]. the fundamental dogma of the [[natural]] goodness
of [[man]] finds no place directly in the _social contract_; but it lurks
behind the whole of his [[political]] theory, and is indeed, throughout,
his master-conception. his educational, his [[religious]], his political
and his ethical ideas [[idea]] are all inspired by a [[single]] consistent attitude.
here we have been attending only to his [[political]] theory; in the volume
which is to [[follow]], containing the _letters on the mount_ and other
works, some attempt will be made to draw the various threads together
and estimate his [[work]] as a whole. the [[political]] works [[work]], however, can be
read separately, and the _social contract_ itself is still by far the
best of all text-books of [[political]] [[philosophy]]. rousseau's political
influence, so far from being [[dead]], is every day increasing; and as new
generations and new classes of [[men]] come to the study of his [[work]], his
conceptions, often hazy and undeveloped, but nearly always of lasting
value, will assuredly form the basis of a new [[political]] [[philosophy]], in
which they will be taken up and transformed. this new [[philosophy]] is
the [[work]] of the future; but, rooted upon the conception of [[rousseau]],
it will stretch far back into the [[past]]. of our [[time]], it will be for
all [[time]]; its solutions will be at once relatively permanent and
ceaselessly progressive.

g. d. h. cole.


[1] the term "general" will means, in [[rousseau]], not so much "will held
by several persons [[person]]," as will having a general (universal) object. this
is often misunderstood; but the mistake matters the less, because the
general will must, in [[fact]], be both.




a note on books


there are few [[good]] books [[book]] in english on rousseau's [[politics]]. by far the
best treatment is to be found in mr. bernard bosanquet's _philosophical
theory of the state_. viscount morley's _rousseau_ is a [[good]] [[life]],
but is not of much use as a criticism of views; mr. w. boyd's _the
educational theory of rousseau_ contains some fairly [[good]] chapters
on the [[political]] views. d. g. ritchie's _darwin and hegel_ includes
an admirable essay on _the social contract theory_ and another on
_sovereignty._ the english translation of professor gran's _rousseau_
is an interesting biography.

in french, there is a [[good]] cheap edition of rousseau's complete works
published by hachette in thirteen volumes. m. dreyfus-brisac's great
edition of the _contrat social_ is indispensable, and there is a good
small edition with notes by m. georges beaulavon. m. faguet's study
of [[rousseau]] in his _dix-huitième siècle--études littéraires_ and his
_politique comparée de montesquieu, voltaire et rousseau_ are useful,
though i am seldom in agreement with them. m. henri rodet's _le contrat
social et les idées politiques de j. j. rousseau_ is useful, if not
inspired, and there are interesting works [[work]] by mm. chuquet, fabre and
lemaître. the french translation of professor höffding's little volume
on _rousseau: sa vie et sa philosophie_ is admirable.

miss foxley's translation of the _emile_, especially of [[book]] v, should
be [[studied]] in connection with the _social contract_. a companion
volume, containing the _letters on the mount_ and other works [[work]], will be
issued shortly.

foreword

this little treatise is part of a longer [[work]] which i began years ago
without realising my limitations, and long since abandoned. of the
various fragments that might have been extracted from what i wrote,
this is the most considerable, and, i [[think]], the least unworthy of
being offered to the [[public]]. the rest no longer exists.




book i


i mean to inquire if, in the civil order, there can be any sure and
legitimate [[rule]] of administration, [[men]] being taken as they are and laws
as they might be. in this inquiry i shall endeavour always to unite
what [[right]] sanctions with what is prescribed by interest, in order that
justice and utility may in no case be divided.

i enter upon my task without proving the importance of the [[subject]]. i
shall be [[asked]] if i am a [[prince]] or a legislator, to write on [[politics]].
i [[answer]] that i am neither, and that is why i do so. if i were a prince
or a legislator, i should not waste [[time]] in saying what wants doing; i
should do it, or hold my [[peace]].

as i was born a citizen of a [[free]] [[state]], and a member of the [[sovereign]],
i [[feel]] that, however feeble the influence my voice can have on public
affairs, the [[right]] of voting on them makes it my [[duty]] to study them:
and i am [[happy]], when i reflect upon governments [[government]], to find my inquiries
always furnish me with new reasons [[reason]] for loving that of my own [[country]].




chapter i

subject of the first book


man is born [[free]]; and everywhere he is in chains. one thinks [[think]] himself
the master of others, and still remains a greater [[slave]] than they. how
did this [[change]] come about? i do not [[know]]. what can make it legitimate?
that [[question]] i [[think]] i can [[answer]].

if i took into account only [[force]], and the effects derived from it, i
should say: "as long as a [[people]] is compelled to obey, and obeys, it
does well; as soon as it can shake off the yoke, and shakes it off,
it does still [[better]]; for, regaining its [[liberty]] by the same right
as took it away, either it is justified in resuming it, or there was
no justification for those who took it away." but the social order is
a [[sacred]] [[right]] which is the basis of all other rights [[right]]. nevertheless,
this [[right]] does not come from [[nature]], and must therefore be founded on
conventions. before coming to that, i have to prove what i have just
asserted.





chapter ii

the first societies


the most ancient of all societies [[society]], and the only one that is natural
is the [[family]]: and even so the [[children]] remain attached to the father
only so long as they need him for their preservation. as soon as this
need ceases, the [[natural]] bond is dissolved. the [[children]], released from
the [[obedience]] they owed to the [[father]], and the [[father]], released from
the [[care]] he owed his [[children]], return equally to independence. if they
remain [[united]], they continue so no longer naturally, but voluntarily;
and the [[family]] itself is then maintained only by convention.

this [[common]] [[liberty]] results from the [[nature]] of [[man]]. his first [[law]] is
to provide for his own preservation, his first cares [[care]] are those which
he owes to himself; and, as soon as he reaches years of discretion,
he is the sole [[judge]] of the proper means of preserving himself, and
consequently becomes his own master.

the [[family]] then may be called the first model of [[political]] societies [[society]]:
the ruler corresponds to the [[father]], and the [[people]] to the [[children]];
and all, being born [[free]] and [[equal]], alienate their [[liberty]] only for
their own advantage. the whole difference is that, in the [[family]], the
love of the [[father]] for his [[children]] repays him for the [[care]] he takes of
them, while, in the [[state]], the [[pleasure]] of commanding takes the place
of the [[love]] which the [[chief]] cannot have for the peoples [[people]] under him.

grotius denies that all [[human]] [[power]] is established in favour of the
governed, and quotes [[slavery]] as an [[example]]. his usual method of
reasoning is constantly to establish [[right]] by [[fact]].[1] it would be
possible to employ a more logical method, but none could be more
favourable to tyrants [[tyrant]].

it is then, according to grotius, doubtful whether the [[human]] race
belongs to a hundred [[men]], or that hundred [[men]] to the [[human]] [[race]]: and,
throughout his [[book]], he seems to incline to the former alternative,
which is also the view of hobbes. on this showing, the [[human]] [[species]] is
divided into so many herds of cattle, each with its ruler, who keeps
guard over them for the [[purpose]] of devouring them.

as a shepherd is of a [[nature]] superior to that of his flock, the
shepherds of [[men]], _i.e._ their rulers, are of a [[nature]] superior to
that of the peoples [[people]] under them. thus, philo tells us, the emperor
caligula reasoned, concluding equally well either that kings [[king]] were gods,
or that [[men]] were beasts.

the reasoning of caligula agrees with that of hobbes and grotius.
aristotle, before any of them, had said that [[men]] are by no means equal
naturally, but that some are born for [[slavery]], and others for dominion.

aristotle was [[right]]; but he took the effect for the cause. nothing
can be more [[certain]] than that every [[man]] born in [[slavery]] is born for
slavery. slaves [[slave]] lose everything in their chains, even the [[desire]] of
escaping from them: they [[love]] their servitude, as the comrades of
ulysses loved their brutish condition.[2] if then there are slaves [[slave]] by
nature, it is because there have been slaves [[slave]] against [[nature]]. [[force]] made
the first slaves [[slave]], and their cowardice perpetuated the condition.

i have said nothing of [[king]] adam, or [[emperor]] noah, [[father]] of the three
great monarchs who shared out the [[universe]], like the [[children]] of
saturn, whom some scholars have recognised in them. i trust to getting
due thanks for my moderation; for, being a direct descendant of one
of these princes [[prince]], perhaps of the eldest branch, how do i [[know]] that a
verification of titles might not leave me the legitimate [[king]] of the
human [[race]]? in any case, there can be no [[doubt]] that adam was sovereign
of the [[world]], as robinson crusoe was of his island, as long as he
was its only inhabitant; and this [[empire]] had the advantage that the
monarch, safe on his [[throne]], had no rebellions, wars [[war]], or conspirators
to [[fear]].


[1] "learned inquiries into [[public]] [[right]] are often only the [[history]] of
past abuses [[abuse]]; and troubling to study them too deeply is a profitless
infatuation" (_essay on the interests of [[france]] in relation to its
neighbours_, by the marquis d'argenson). this is exactly what grotius
has done.

[2] see a short treatise of plutarch's entitled "that animals [[reason]]."




chapter iii

the [[right]] of the strongest


the strongest is never [[strong]] enough to be always the master, unless
he transforms [[strength]] into [[right]], and [[obedience]] into [[duty]]. hence the
right of the strongest, which, though to all seeming meant ironically,
is really laid down as a fundamental [[principle]]. but are we never to
have an explanation of this phrase? [[force]] is a physical [[power]], and i
fail to see what [[moral]] effect it can have. to yield to [[force]] is an act
of necessity, not of will--at the most, an act of prudence. in what
sense can it be a [[duty]]?

suppose for a moment that this so-called "right" exists. i maintain
that the sole result is a mass of inexplicable nonsense. for, if force
creates [[right]], the effect changes [[change]] with the cause: every [[force]] that
is greater than the first succeeds to its [[right]]. as soon as it is
possible to disobey with impunity, disobedience is legitimate; and, the
strongest being always in the [[right]], the only thing that matters is
to act so as to become the strongest. but what [[kind]] of [[right]] is that
which perishes when [[force]] fails? if we must obey perforce, there is no
need to obey because we ought; and if we are not forced to obey, we are
under no obligation to do so. clearly, the word "right" adds nothing to
force: in this connection, it means absolutely nothing.

obey the powers [[power]] that be. if this means yield to [[force]], it is a good
precept, but superfluous: i can [[answer]] for its never being violated.
all [[power]] comes from [[god]], i admit; but so does all sickness: does that
mean that we are forbidden to call in the doctor? a brigand surprises
me at the edge of a wood: must i not merely [[surrender]] my purse on
compulsion; but, even if i could withhold it, am i in [[conscience]] bound
to give it up? for certainly the pistol he holds is also a [[power]].

let us then admit that [[force]] does not create [[right]], and that we are
obliged to obey only legitimate powers [[power]]. in that case, my original
question recurs.




chapter iv

slavery


since no [[man]] has a [[natural]] [[authority]] over his fellow, and [[force]] creates
no [[right]], we must conclude that conventions form the basis of all
legitimate [[authority]] among [[men]].

if an [[individual]], says grotius, can alienate his [[liberty]] and make
himself the [[slave]] of a master, why could not a whole [[people]] do the same
and make itself [[subject]] to a [[king]]? there are in this passage plenty
of ambiguous words which would need explaining; but let us confine
ourselves to the word _alienate_. to alienate is to give or to sell.
now, a [[man]] who becomes the [[slave]] of another does not give himself; he
sells himself, at the least for his subsistence: but for what does a
people sell itself? a [[king]] is so far from furnishing his subjects [[subject]] with
their subsistence that he gets his own only from them; and, according
to rabelais, kings [[king]] do not [[live]] on nothing. do subjects [[subject]] then give their
persons on condition that the [[king]] takes their goods [[good]] also? i fail to
see what they have left to preserve.

it will be said that the despot assures his subjects [[subject]] civil
tranquillity. granted; but what do they gain, if the wars [[war]] his
ambition brings down upon them, his insatiable avidity, and the
vexatious conduct of his ministers press harder on them than their
own dissensions would have done? what do they gain, if the very
tranquillity they enjoy is one of their miseries? tranquillity is found
also in dungeons; but is that enough to make them desirable places to
live in? the greeks [[greek]] imprisoned in the cave of the cyclops lived there
very tranquilly, while they were awaiting their turn to be devoured.

to say that a [[man]] gives himself gratuitously, is to say what is absurd
and inconceivable; such an act is null and illegitimate, from the mere
fact that he who does it is out of his [[mind]]. to say the same of a whole
people is to suppose a [[people]] of madmen; and madness creates no [[right]].

even if each [[man]] could alienate himself, he could not alienate his
children: they are born [[men]] and [[free]]; their [[liberty]] belongs to them,
and no one but they has the [[right]] to dispose of it. before they come to
years of discretion, the [[father]] can, in their name, lay down conditions
for their preservation and well-being, but he cannot give them,
irrevocably and without conditions: such a gift is contrary to the ends
of [[nature]], and exceeds the rights [[right]] of paternity. it would therefore be
necessary, in order to legitimise an arbitrary [[government]], that in
every [[generation]] the [[people]] should be in a position to accept or reject
it; but, were this so, the [[government]] would be no longer arbitrary.

to renounce [[liberty]] is to renounce being a [[man]], to [[surrender]] the rights
of [[humanity]] and even its duties [[duty]]. for him who renounces everything no
indemnity is possible. such a renunciation is incompatible with man's
nature; to remove all [[liberty]] from his will is to remove all morality
from his acts. finally, it is an empty and contradictory convention
that sets up, on the one side, absolute [[authority]], and, on the other,
unlimited [[obedience]]. is it not clear that we can be under no obligation
to a [[person]] from whom we have the [[right]] to exact everything? does not
this condition alone, in the absence of equivalence or exchange, in
itself involve the nullity of the act? for what [[right]] can my [[slave]] have
against me, when all that he has belongs to me, and, his [[right]] being
mine, this [[right]] of mine against myself is a phrase devoid of meaning?

grotius and the rest find in [[war]] another origin for the so-called right
of [[slavery]]. the victor having, as they hold, the [[right]] of killing
the vanquished, the latter can buy back his [[life]] at the price of his
liberty; and this convention is the more legitimate because it is to
the advantage of both parties.

but it is clear that this supposed [[right]] to kill the conquered is by no
means deducible from the [[state]] of [[war]]. [[men]], from the mere [[fact]] that,
while they are living in their primitive independence, they have no
mutual relations stable enough to constitute either the [[state]] of peace
or the [[state]] of [[war]], cannot be naturally enemies [[enemy]]. [[war]] is constituted by
a relation between things, and not between persons [[person]]; and, as the state
of [[war]] cannot arise out of simple personal relations, but only out of
real relations, private [[war]], or [[war]] of [[man]] with [[man]], can [[exist]] neither
in the [[state]] of [[nature]], where there is no constant [[property]], nor in the
social [[state]], where everything is under the [[authority]] of the laws [[law]].

individual combats, duels and encounters, are acts which cannot
constitute a [[state]]; while the private wars [[war]], authorised by the
establishments of louis ix, [[king]] of [[france]], and suspended by the peace
of [[god]], are abuses [[abuse]] of feudalism, in itself an absurd [[system]] if ever
there was one, and contrary to the principles [[principle]] of [[natural]] [[right]] and to
all [[good]] polity.

war then is a relation, not between [[man]] and [[man]], but between [[state]] and
state, and individuals [[individual]] are enemies [[enemy]] only accidentally, not as [[men]], nor
even as [[citizens]],[1] but as soldiers; not as members of their [[country]],
but as its defenders. finally, each [[state]] can have for enemies [[enemy]] only
other states, and not [[men]]; for between things disparate in [[nature]] there
can be no real relation.

furthermore, this [[principle]] is in conformity with the established
rules of all times [[time]] and the constant practice of all civilised peoples [[people]].
declarations of [[war]] are intimations less to powers [[power]] than to their
subjects. the foreigner, whether [[king]], [[individual]], or [[people]], who robs,
kills or detains the subjects [[subject]], without declaring [[war]] on the [[prince]],
is not an [[enemy]], but a brigand. even in real [[war]], a just [[prince]],
while laying hands, in the enemy's [[country]], on all that belongs to
the [[public]], respects [[respect]] the lives [[life]] and goods [[good]] of individuals [[individual]]: he respects
rights on which his own are founded. the object of the [[war]] being the
destruction of the hostile [[state]], the other side has a [[right]] to kill
its defenders, while they are bearing arms; but as soon as they lay
them down and [[surrender]], they cease to be enemies [[enemy]] or instruments of the
enemy, and become once more merely [[men]], whose [[life]] no one has any right
to take. sometimes it is possible to kill the [[state]] without killing
a [[single]] one of its members; and [[war]] gives no [[right]] which is not
necessary to the gaining of its object. these principles [[principle]] are not those
of grotius: they are not based on the [[authority]] of poets, but derived
from the [[nature]] of reality and based on [[reason]].

the [[right]] of [[conquest]] has no foundation other than the [[right]] of the
strongest. if [[war]] does not give the conqueror the [[right]] to massacre the
conquered peoples [[people]], the [[right]] to enslave them cannot be based upon a
right which does not [[exist]] no one has a [[right]] to kill an [[enemy]] except
when he cannot make him a [[slave]], and the [[right]] to enslave him cannot
therefore be derived from the [[right]] to kill him. it is accordingly an
unfair exchange to make him buy at the price of his [[liberty]] his [[life]],
over which the victor holds no [[right]]. is it not clear that there is a
vicious circle in founding the [[right]] of [[life]] and [[death]] on the [[right]] of
slavery, and the [[right]] of [[slavery]] on the [[right]] of [[life]] and [[death]]?

even if we assume this terrible [[right]] to kill everybody, i maintain
that a [[slave]] made in [[war]], or a conquered [[people]], is under no obligation
to a master, except to obey him as far as he is compelled to do so.
by taking an equivalent for his [[life]], the victor has not done him
a favour; instead of killing him without [[profit]], he has killed him
usefully. so far then is he from acquiring over him any [[authority]] in
addition to that of [[force]], that the [[state]] of [[war]] continues to subsist
between them: their mutual relation is the effect of it, and the usage
of the [[right]] of [[war]] does not imply a treaty of [[peace]]. a convention has
indeed been made; but this convention, so far from destroying the state
of [[war]], presupposes its continuance.

so, from whatever aspect we regard the [[question]], the [[right]] of slavery
is null and void, not only as being illegitimate, but also because it
is absurd and meaningless. the words _slave_ and _right_ contradict
each other, and are mutually exclusive. it will always be equally
foolish for a [[man]] to say to a [[man]] or to a [[people]]: "i make with you a
convention wholly at your expense and wholly to my advantage; i shall
keep it as long as i like, and you will keep it as long as i like."


[1] the romans, who understood and respected the [[right]] of [[war]] more
than any other nation on [[earth]], carried their scruples on this head
so far that a citizen was not allowed to serve as a volunteer without
engaging himself expressly against the [[enemy]], and against such and
such an [[enemy]] by name. a legion in which the younger cato was seeing
his first service under popilius having been reconstructed, the elder
cato wrote to popilius that, if he wished his [[son]] to continue serving
under him, he must administer to him a new [[military]] oath, because, the
first having been annulled, he was no longer able to bear arms against
the [[enemy]]. the same cato wrote to his [[son]] telling him to take great
care not to go into [[battle]] before taking this new oath. i [[know]] that the
siege of clusium and other isolated events can be quoted against me;
but i am citing laws [[law]] and customs. the romans are the [[people]] that least
often transgressed its laws [[law]]; and no other [[people]] has had such [[good]] ones.



chapter v

that we must always go back to a first convention


even if i granted all that i have been refuting, the [[friends]] of
despotism would be no [[better]] off. there will always be a great
difference between subduing a multitude and ruling a [[society]]. even if
scattered individuals [[individual]] were successively enslaved by one [[man]], however
numerous they might be, i still see no more than a master and his
slaves, and certainly not a [[people]] and its ruler; i see what may be
termed an aggregation, but not an association; there is as yet neither
public [[good]] nor [[body]] [[politic]]. the [[man]] in [[question]], even if he has
enslaved half the [[world]], is still only an [[individual]]; his interest,
apart from that of others, is still a purely private interest. if this
same [[man]] comes to [[die]], his [[empire]], after him, remains scattered and
without unity, as an oak falls and dissolves into a heap of ashes when
the [[fire]] has consumed it.

a [[people]], says grotius, can give itself to a [[king]]. then, according
to grotius, a [[people]] is a [[people]] before it gives itself. the gift
is itself a civil act, and implies [[public]] deliberation. it would be
better, before examining the act by which a [[people]] gives itself to a
king, to examine that by which it has become a [[people]]; for this act,
being necessarily prior to the other, is the true foundation of [[society]].

indeed, if there were no prior convention, where, unless the election
were unanimous, would be the obligation on the minority to submit
to the [[choice]] of the majority? how have a hundred [[men]] who [[wish]] for
a master the [[right]] to vote on behalf of ten who do not? the [[law]] of
majority voting is itself something established by convention, and
presupposes unanimity, on one [[occasion]] at least.




chapter vi

the social compact


i suppose [[men]] to have reached the point at which the obstacles in the
way of their preservation in the [[state]] of [[nature]] show their [[power]] of
resistance to be greater than the resources at the disposal of each
individual for his maintenance in that [[state]]. that primitive condition
can then subsist no longer; and the [[human]] [[race]] would perish unless it
changed its manner of existence.

but, as [[men]] cannot engender new forces [[force]], but only unite and direct
existing ones, they have no other means of preserving themselves than
the formation, by aggregation, of a sum of forces [[force]] [[great]] enough to
overcome the [[resistance]]. these they have to bring into play by means of
a [[single]] motive [[power]], and cause to act in concert.

this sum of forces [[force]] can arise only where several persons [[person]] come together:
but, as the [[force]] and [[liberty]] of each [[man]] are the [[chief]] instruments of
his self-preservation, how can he pledge them without harming his own
interests, and neglecting the [[care]] he owes to himself? this difficulty,
in its bearing on my [[present]] [[subject]], may be stated in the following
terms--

"the problem is to find a form of association which will defend and
protect with the whole [[common]] [[force]] the [[person]] and goods [[good]] of each
associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may
still obey himself alone, and remain as [[free]] as before." this is
the fundamental problem of which the _social contract_ provides the
solution.

the clauses of this contract are so determined by the [[nature]] of the act
that the slightest modification would make them [[vain]] and ineffective;
so that, although they have perhaps never been formally set forth,
they are everywhere the same and everywhere tacitly admitted and
recognised, until, on the violation of the social compact, each regains
his original rights [[right]] and resumes his [[natural]] [[liberty]], while losing the
conventional [[liberty]] in favour of which he renounced it.

these clauses, properly understood, may be reduced to one--the total
alienation of each associate, together with all his rights [[right]], to the
whole [[community]] for, in the first place, as each gives himself
absolutely, the conditions are the same for all; and, this being so, no
one has any interest in making them burdensome to others.

moreover, the alienation being without reserve, the union is as perfect
as it can be, and no associate has anything more to demand: for, if
the individuals [[individual]] retained [[certain]] rights [[right]], as there would be no common
superior to decide between them and the [[public]], each, being on one
point his own [[judge]], would ask to be so on all; the [[state]] of nature
would thus continue, and the association would necessarily become
inoperative or [[tyrannical]].

finally, each [[man]], in giving himself to all, gives himself to nobody;
and as there is no associate over whom he does not acquire the same
right as he yields others over himself, he gains an equivalent for
everything he loses, and an increase of [[force]] for the preservation of
what he has.

if then we discard from the social compact what is not of its essence,
we shall find that it reduces itself to the following terms--

_"each of us puts his [[person]] and all his [[power]] in [[common]] under the
supreme direction of the general will, and, in our corporate capacity,
we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole._"

at once, in place of the [[individual]] personality of each contracting
party, this act of association creates a [[moral]] and collective [[body]],
composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and
receiving from this act its unity, its [[common]] identity, its [[life]] and
its will. this [[public]] [[person]], so formed by the union of all other
persons, formerly took the name of _city_,[1] and now takes that of
_republic_ or _body politic_; it is called by its members _state_ when
passive, _sovereign_ when active, and _power_ when compared with others
like itself. those who are associated in it take collectively the name
of _people_, and severally are called _citizens_, as sharing in the
sovereign [[power]], and _subjects_, as being under the laws [[law]] of the [[state]].
but these terms are often confused and taken one for another: it is
enough to [[know]] how to distinguish them when they are being used with
precision.


[1] the real meaning of this word has been almost wholly lost in
modern times [[time]]; most [[people]] mistake a town for a [[city]], and a townsman
for a citizen. they do not [[know]] that houses make a town, but citizens
a [[city]]. the same mistake long ago cost the carthaginians dear. i
have never [[read]] of the title of [[citizens]] being given to the subjects
of any [[prince]], not even the ancient macedonians or the english of
to-day, though they are nearer [[liberty]] than any one else. the french
alone everywhere familiarly adopt the name of [[citizens]], because,
as can be seen from their dictionaries, they have no [[idea]] of its
meaning; otherwise they would be guilty in usurping it, of the crime
of _lèse-majesté_: among them, the name expresses a [[virtue]], and not
a [[right]]. when bodin spoke of our [[citizens]] and townsmen, he fell into
a [[bad]] blunder in taking the one class for the other. m. d'alembert
has avoided the error, and, in his article on geneva, has clearly
distinguished the four orders of [[men]] (or even five, counting mere
foreigners) who dwell in our town, of which two only compose the
republic. no other french writer, to my [[knowledge]], has understood the
real meaning of the word citizen.




chapter vii

the sovereign


this formula shows us that the act of association comprises a mutual
undertaking between the [[public]] and the individuals [[individual]], and that each
individual, in making a contract, as we may say, with himself, is bound
in a double capacity; as a member of the [[sovereign]] he is bound to the
individuals, and as a member of the [[state]] to the [[sovereign]]. but the
maxim of civil [[right]], that no one is bound by undertakings made to
himself, does not apply in this case; for there is a [[great]] difference
between incurring an obligation to yourself and incurring one to a
whole of which you form a part.

attention must further be called to the [[fact]] that [[public]] deliberation,
while competent to bind all the subjects [[subject]] to the [[sovereign]], because of
the two different capacities in which each of them may be regarded,
cannot, for the opposite [[reason]], bind the [[sovereign]] to itself; and
that it is consequently against the [[nature]] of the [[body]] [[politic]] for the
sovereign to impose on itself a [[law]] which it cannot infringe. being
able to regard itself in only one capacity, it is in the position of an
individual who makes a contract with himself; and this makes it clear
that there neither is nor can be any [[kind]] of fundamental [[law]] binding
on the [[body]] of the people--not even the social contract itself. this
does not mean that the [[body]] [[politic]] cannot enter into undertakings with
others, provided the contract is not infringed by them; for in relation
to what is external to it, it becomes a simple being, an [[individual]].

but the [[body]] [[politic]] or the [[sovereign]], drawing its being wholly from
the [[sanctity]] of the contract, can never bind itself, even to an
outsider, to do anything derogatory to the original act, for instance,
to alienate any part of itself, or to submit to another [[sovereign]].
violation of the act by which it exists would be self-annihilation; and
that which is itself nothing can create nothing.

as soon as this multitude is so [[united]] in one [[body]], it is impossible to
offend against one of the members without attacking the [[body]], and still
more to offend against the [[body]] without the members resenting it. duty
and interest therefore equally oblige the two contracting parties to
give each other [[help]]; and the same [[men]] should seek to combine, in their
double capacity, all the advantages dependent upon that capacity.

again, the [[sovereign]], being formed wholly of the individuals [[individual]] who
compose it, neither has nor can have any interest contrary to theirs;
and consequently the [[sovereign]] [[power]] need give no guarantee to its
subjects, because it is impossible for the [[body]] to [[wish]] to hurt all
its members. we shall also see later on that it cannot hurt any in
particular. the [[sovereign]], merely by [[virtue]] of what it is, is is always
what it should be.

this, however, is not the case with the relation of the subjects [[subject]] to the
sovereign, which, despite the [[common]] interest, would have no security
that they would fulfil their undertakings, unless it found means to
assure itself of their fidelity.

in [[fact]], each [[individual]], as a [[man]], may have a particular will
contrary or dissimilar to the general will which he has as a citizen.
his particular interest may speak to him quite differently from the
common interest: his absolute and naturally independent existence may
make him look upon what he owes to the [[common]] cause as a gratuitous
contribution, the loss of which will do less harm to others than the
payment of it is burdensome to himself; and, regarding the [[moral]] person
which constitutes the [[state]] as a persona ficta, because not a [[man]], he
may [[wish]] to enjoy the rights [[right]] of citizenship without being ready to
fulfil the duties [[duty]] of a [[subject]]. the continuance of such an injustice
could not but prove the undoing of the [[body]] [[politic]].

in order then that the social compact may not be an empty formula, it
tacitly includes the undertaking, which alone can give [[force]] to the
rest, that whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be compelled
to do so by the whole [[body]]. this means nothing less than that he will
be forced to be [[free]]; for this is the condition which, by giving each
citizen to his [[country]], secures him against all personal dependence. in
this lies [[lie]] the key to the working of the [[political]] machine; this alone
legitimizes civil undertakings, which, without it, would be absurd,
tyrannical, and liable to the most frightful abuses [[abuse]].




chapter viii

the civil state


the passage from the [[state]] of [[nature]] to the civil [[state]] produces [[produce]] a very
remarkable [[change]] in [[man]], by substituting [[justice]], for instinct in his
conduct, and giving his actions the morality they had formerly lacked.
then only, when the voice of [[duty]] takes the place of physical impulses
and [[right]] of appetite, does _man_, who so far had considered only
himself, find that he is forced to act on different principles [[principle]], and
to consult his [[reason]] before listening to his inclinations. although,
in this [[state]], he deprives himself of some advantages which he got
from [[nature]], he gains in return others so [[great]], his faculties are
so stimulated and developed, his ideas [[idea]] so extended, his feelings so
ennobled, and his whole [[soul]] so uplifted, that, did not the abuses [[abuse]] of
this new condition often degrade him below that which he left, he would
be bound to bless continually the [[happy]] moment which took him from it
for ever, and, instead of a stupid and unimaginative animal, made him
an [[intelligent]] being and a [[man]].

let us draw up the whole account in terms easily commensurable.
what [[man]] loses by the social contract in his [[natural]] [[liberty]] and
an unlimited [[right]] to everything he tries to get and succeeds in
getting; what he gains is civil [[liberty]] and the proprietorship of all
he possesses. if we are to avoid mistake in weighing one against the
other, we must clearly distinguish [[natural]] [[liberty]], which is bounded
only by the [[strength]] of the [[individual]], from civil [[liberty]], which is
limited by the general will; and possession, which is merely the effect
of [[force]] or the [[right]] of the first occupier, from [[property]], which can
be founded only on a positive title.

we might, over and above all this, add, to what [[man]] acquires in the
civil [[state]], [[moral]] [[liberty]], which alone makes him truly master of
himself; for the mere impulse of appetite is [[slavery]], while obedience
to a [[law]] which we prescribe to ourselves is [[liberty]]. but i have already
said too much on this head, and the philosophical meaning of the word
liberty does not now concern us.




chapter ix

real property


each member of the [[community]] gives himself to it, at the moment of
its foundation, just as he is, with all the resources at his command,
including the goods [[good]] he possesses. this act does not make possession, in
changing hands, [[change]] its [[nature]], and becomes [[property]] in the hands
of the [[sovereign]]; but, as the forces [[force]] of the [[city]] are incomparably
greater than those of an [[individual]], [[public]] possession is also, in
fact, stronger and more irrevocable, without being any more legitimate,
at any rate from the point of view of foreigners. for the [[state]], in
relation to its members, is master of all their goods [[good]] by the social
contract, which, within the [[state]], is the basis of all rights [[right]]; but,
in relation to other powers [[power]], it is so only by the [[right]] of the first
occupier, which it holds from its members.

the [[right]] of the first occupier, though more real than the [[right]] of the
strongest, becomes a real [[right]] only when the [[right]] of [[property]] has
already been established. every [[man]] has naturally a [[right]] to everything
he needs; but the positive act which makes him proprietor of one thing
excludes him from everything else. having his share, he ought to keep
to it, and can have no further [[right]] against the [[community]]. this is why
the [[right]] of the first occupier, which in the [[state]] of [[nature]] is so
weak, claims the [[respect]] of every [[man]] in civil [[society]]. in this right
we are respecting not so much what belongs to another as what does not
belong to ourselves.

in general, to establish the [[right]] of the first occupier over a plot of
ground, the following conditions are necessary: first, the [[land]] must
not yet be inhabited; secondly, a [[man]] must occupy only the amount he
needs for his subsistence; and, in the third place, possession must be
taken, not by an empty [[ceremony]], but by [[labour]] and cultivation, the
only sign of proprietorship that should be respected by others, in
default of a legal title.

in granting the [[right]] of first occupancy to necessity and [[labour]],
are we not really stretching it as far as it can go? is it possible
to leave such a [[right]] unlimited? is it to be enough to set foot on a
plot of [[common]] ground, in order to be able to call yourself at once
the master of it? is it to be enough that a [[man]] has the [[strength]] to
expel others for a moment, in order to establish his [[right]] to prevent
them from ever returning? how can a [[man]] or a [[people]] seize an immense
territory and keep it from the rest of the [[world]] except by a punishable
usurpation, since all others are being robbed, by such an act, of
the place of habitation and the means of subsistence which nature
gave them in [[common]]? when nuñez balbao, standing on the sea-shore,
took possession of the south seas and the whole of south [[america]] in
the name of the [[crown]] of castille, was that enough to dispossess all
their actual inhabitants, and to shut out from them all the princes [[prince]] of
the [[world]]? on such a showing, these ceremonies [[ceremony]] are idly multiplied,
and the catholic [[king]] need only take possession all at once, from
his apartment, of the whole [[universe]], merely making a subsequent
reservation about what was already in the possession of other princes [[prince]].

we can imagine how the lands [[land]] of individuals [[individual]], where they were contiguous
and came to be [[united]], became the [[public]] territory, and how the right
of sovereignty, extending from the subjects [[subject]] over the lands [[land]] they held,
became at once real and personal. the possessors were thus made more
dependent, and the forces [[force]] at their command used to guarantee their
fidelity. the advantage of this does not seem to have been felt
by ancient monarchs, who called themselves [[king]] of the persians,
scythians, or macedonians, and seemed to regard themselves more as
rulers of [[men]] than as masters of a [[country]]. those of the present
day more cleverly call themselves kings [[king]] of [[france]], [[spain]], [[england]],
etc.: thus holding the [[land]], they are quite confident of holding the
inhabitants.

the peculiar [[fact]] about this alienation is that, in taking over the
goods of individuals [[individual]], the [[community]], so far from despoiling them, only
assures them legitimate possession, and changes [[change]] usurpation into a true
right and enjoyment into proprietorship. thus the possessors, being
regarded as depositaries of the [[public]] [[good]], and having their rights [[right]],
respected by all the members of the [[state]] and maintained against
foreign aggression by all its forces [[force]], have, by a cession which benefits
both the [[public]] and still more themselves, acquired, so to speak,
all that they gave up. this paradox may easily be explained by the
distinction between the rights [[right]] which the [[sovereign]] and the proprietor
have over the same estate, as we shall see later on. it may also happen
that [[men]] begin to unite one with another before they possess anything,
and that, subsequently occupying a tract of [[country]] which is enough for
all, they enjoy it in [[common]], or share it out among themselves, either
equally or according to a scale fixed by they [[sovereign]]. however the
acquisition be made, the [[right]] which each [[individual]] has to his own
estate is always subordinate to the [[right]] which the [[community]] has over
all: without this, there would be neither stability in the social tie,
nor real [[force]] in the exercise of sovereignty.

i shall end this [[chapter]] and this [[book]] by remarking on a [[fact]] on
which the whole social [[system]] should rest: _i.e._ that, instead of
destroying [[natural]] inequality, the fundamental compact substitutes,
for such physical inequality as [[nature]] may have set up between [[men]], an
equality that is [[moral]] and legitimate, and that [[men]], who may be unequal
in [[strength]] or [[intelligence]], become every one [[equal]] by convention and
legal [[right]].[1]




book ii


chapter i

that sovereignty is inalienable


the first and most important deduction from the principles [[principle]] we have
so far laid down is that the general will alone can direct the state
according to the object for which it was instituted, _i.e._ the
common [[good]]: for if the clashing of particular interests made the
establishment of societies [[society]] necessary, the agreement of these very
interests made it possible. the [[common]] element in these different
interests is what forms the social tie; and, were there no point of
agreement between them all, no [[society]] could [[exist]]. it is solely on the
basis of this [[common]] interest that every [[society]] should be governed.

i hold then that sovereignty, being nothing less than the exercise of
the general will, can never be alienated, and that the [[sovereign]], who
is no less than a collective being, cannot be represented except by
himself: the [[power]] indeed may be transmitted, but not the will.

in reality, if it is not impossible for a particular will to agree on
some point with the general will, it is at least impossible for the
agreement to be lasting and constant; for the particular will tends,
by its very [[nature]], to partiality, while the general will tends to
equality. it is even more impossible to have any guarantee of this
agreement; for even if it should always [[exist]], it would be the effect
not of art [[arts]], but of [[chance]]. the [[sovereign]] may indeed say: "i now will
actually what this [[man]] wills, or at least what he says he wills"; but
it cannot say: "what he wills tomorrow, i too shall will" because it is
absurd for the will to bind itself for the future, nor is it incumbent
on any will to [[consent]] to anything that is not for the [[good]] of the
being who wills. if then the [[people]] promises simply to obey, by that
very act it dissolves itself and loses what makes it a [[people]]; the
moment a master exists, there is no longer a [[sovereign]], and from that
moment the [[body]] [[politic]] has ceased to [[exist]].

this does not mean that the commands of the rulers cannot pass for
general wills, so long as the [[sovereign]], being [[free]] to oppose them,
offers no opposition. in such a case, universal [[silence]] is taken to
imply the [[consent]] of the [[people]]. this will be explained later on.


[1] under [[bad]] governments [[government]], this equality is only apparent and illusory:
it serves only to keep the pauper in his [[poverty]] and the [[rich]] [[man]] in
the position he has usurped. in [[fact]], laws [[law]] are always of use to those
who possess and harmful to those who have nothing: from which it
follows that the social [[state]] is advantageous to [[men]] only when all have
something and none too much.



chapter ii

that sovereignty is indivisible


sovereignty, for the same [[reason]] as makes it inalienable, is
indivisible; for will either is, or is not, general;[1] it is the
will either of the [[body]] of the [[people]], or only of a part of it. in
the first case, the will, when declared, is an act of sovereignty and
constitutes [[law]]: in the second, it is merely a particular will, or act
of magistracy--at the most a decree.

but our [[political]] theorists, unable to divide sovereignty in
principle, divide it according to its object: into [[force]] and will;
into legislative [[power]] and executive [[power]]; into rights [[right]] of [[taxation]],
justice and [[war]]; into internal administration and [[power]] of foreign
treaty. sometimes they confuse all these sections, and sometimes they
distinguish them; they turn the [[sovereign]] into a fantastic being
composed of several connected pieces: it is as if they were making man
of several bodies [[body]], one with [[eyes]], one with arms, another with feet,
and each with nothing besides. we are told that the jugglers of japan
dismember a child before the [[eyes]] of the spectators; then they throw
all the members into the air one after another, and the child falls
down alive and whole. the conjuring tricks of our [[political]] theorists
are very like that; they first dismember the [[body]] [[politic]] by an
illusion worthy of a [[fair]], and then join it together again we [[know]] not
how.

this error is due to a lack of exact notions concerning the sovereign
authority, and to taking for parts of it what are only emanations from
it. thus, for [[example]], the acts of declaring [[war]] and making [[peace]] have
been regarded as acts of sovereignty; but this is not the case, as
these acts do not constitute [[law]], but merely the application of a [[law]],
a particular act which decides how the [[law]] applies, as we shall see
clearly when the [[idea]] attached to the word _law_ has been defined.

if we examined the other divisions in the same manner, we should find
that, whenever sovereignty seems to be divided, there is an illusion:
the rights [[right]] which are taken as being part of sovereignty are really all
subordinate, and always imply supreme wills of which they only sanction
the execution.

it would be impossible to estimate the obscurity this lack of exactness
has thrown over the decisions of writers who have dealt with political
right, when they have used the principles [[principle]] laid down by them to pass
judgment on the respective rights [[right]] of kings [[king]] and peoples [[people]]. every one can
see, in chapters [[chapter]] iii and iv of the first [[book]] of grotius, how the
learned [[man]] and his translator, barbeyrac, entangle and tie themselves
up in their own sophistries, for [[fear]] of saying too little or too
much of what they [[think]], and so offending the interests they have to
conciliate. grotius, a refugee in [[france]], ill-content with his own
country, and desirous of paying his court to louis xiii, to whom his
book is dedicated, spares no pains [[pain]] to rob the peoples [[people]] of all their
rights and invest kings [[king]] with them by every conceivable artifice. this
would also have been much to the taste of barbeyrac, who dedicated his
translation to george i of [[england]]. but unfortunately the expulsion
of james ii, which he called his "abdication," compelled him to use
all reserve, to shuffle and to tergiversate, in order to avoid making
william out a usurper. if these two writers had adopted the true
principles, all difficulties would have been removed, and they would
have been always consistent; but it would have been a [[sad]] [[truth]] for
them to tell, and would have paid court for them to no-one save the
people. moreover, [[truth]] is no road to [[fortune]], and the [[people]] dispenses
neither ambassadorships, nor professorships, nor pensions.


[1] to be general, a will need not always be unanimous; but every
vote--must be counted: any exclusion is a breach of generality.




chapter iii

whether the general will is fallible


it follows from what has gone before that the general will is always
right and tends to the [[public]] advantage; but it does not [[follow]] that
the deliberations of the [[people]] are always equally [[correct]]. our will
is always for our own [[good]], but we do not always see what that is;
the [[people]] is never corrupted, but it is often deceived, and on such
occasions only does it seem to will what is [[bad]].

there is often a [[great]] deal of difference between the will of all and
the general will; the latter considers only the [[common]] interest, while
the former takes private interest into account, and is no more than a
sum of particular wills: but take away from these same wills the pluses
and minuses that cancel one another,[1] and the general will remains as
the sum of the differences.

if, when the [[people]], being furnished with adequate information, held
its deliberations, the [[citizens]] had no communication one with another,
the grand total of the small differences would always give the general
will, and the decision would always be [[good]]. but when factions arise,
and partial associations are formed at the expense of the great
association, the will of each of these associations becomes general
in relation to its members, while it remains particular in relation
to the [[state]]: it may then be said that there are no longer as many
votes as there are [[men]], but only as many as there are associations.
the differences become less numerous and give a less general result.
lastly, when one of these associations is so [[great]] as to prevail over
all the rest, the result is no longer a sum of small differences, but a
single difference; in this case there is no longer a general will, and
the [[opinion]] which prevails is purely particular.

it is therefore essential, if the general will is to be able to express
itself, that there should be no partial [[society]] within the [[state]],
and that each citizen should [[think]] only his own thoughts [[thought]]:[2] which
was indeed the sublime and unique [[system]] established by the great
lycurgus. but if there are partial societies [[society]], it is [[best]] to have as
many as possible and to prevent them from being unequal, as was done by
solon, numa and servius. these precautions are the only ones that can
guarantee that the general will shall be always enlightened, and that
the [[people]] shall in no way [[deceive]] itself.


[1] "every interest," says the marquis d'argenson, "has different
principles. the agreement of two particular interests is formed by
opposition to a third." he might have added that the agreement of all
interests is formed by opposition to that of each. if there were no
different interests, the [[common]] interest would be barely [[felt]], as it
would encounter no obstacle; all would go on of its own accord, and
politics would cease to be an art [[arts]].

[2] "in [[fact]]," says macchiavelli, "there are some divisions that are
harmful to a [[republic]] and some that are advantageous. those which
stir up sects and parties are harmful; those attended by neither are
advantageous. since, then, the founder of a [[republic]] cannot help
enmities arising, he ought at least to prevent them from growing into
sects" (_history of florence,_ [[book]] vii). [[rousseau]] quotes the italian.




chapter iv

the limits of the [[sovereign]] power


if the [[state]] is a [[moral]] [[person]] whose [[life]] is in the union of its
members, and if the most important of its cares [[care]] is the [[care]] for its
own preservation, it must have a universal and compelling [[force]], in
order to move and dispose each part as may be most advantageous to the
whole. as [[nature]] gives each [[man]] absolute [[power]] over all his members,
the social compact gives the [[body]] [[politic]] absolute [[power]] over all its
members also; and it is this [[power]] which, under the direction of the
general will, bears, as i have said, the name of sovereignty.

but, besides the [[public]] [[person]], we have to consider the private persons
composing it, whose [[life]] and [[liberty]] are naturally independent of it.
we are bound then to distinguish clearly between the respective rights
of the [[citizens]] and the [[sovereign]],[1] and between the duties [[duty]] the former
have to fulfil as subjects [[subject]], and the [[natural]] rights [[right]] they should enjoy as
men.

each [[man]] alienates, i admit, by the social compact, only such part of
his powers [[power]], goods [[good]] and [[liberty]] as it is important for the [[community]] to
control; but it must also be granted that the [[sovereign]] is sole judge
of what is important.

every service a citizen can render the [[state]] he ought to render as soon
as the [[sovereign]] demands it; but the [[sovereign]], for its part, cannot
impose upon its subjects [[subject]] any fetters that are useless to the [[community]],
nor can it even [[wish]] to do so; for no more by the [[law]] of [[reason]] than by
the [[law]] of [[nature]] can anything occur without a cause.

the undertakings which bind us to the social [[body]] are obligatory only
because they are mutual; and their [[nature]] is such that in fulfilling
them we cannot [[work]] for others without working for ourselves. why is it
that the general will is always in the [[right]], and that all continually
will the [[happiness]] of each one, unless it is because there is not a
man who does not [[think]] of "each" as meaning him, and consider himself
in voting for all? this proves that equality of rights [[right]] and the idea
of [[justice]] which such equality creates originate in the preference
each [[man]] gives to himself, and accordingly in the very [[nature]] of [[man]].
it proves that the general will, to be really such, must be general
in its object as well as its essence; that it must both come from all
and apply to all; and that it loses its [[natural]] rectitude when it is
directed to some particular and determinate object, because in such
a case we are judging of something [[foreign]] to us, and have no true
principle of equity to guide us.

indeed, as soon as a [[question]] of particular [[fact]] or [[right]] arises on
a point not previously regulated by a general convention, the matter
becomes contentious. it is a case in which the individuals [[individual]] concerned
are one party, and the [[public]] the other, but in which i can see neither
the [[law]] that ought to be followed nor the [[judge]] who ought to give the
decision. in such a case, it would be absurd to propose to refer the
question to an express decision of the general will, which can be
only the conclusion reached by one of the parties and in consequence
will be, for the other party, merely an external and particular will,
inclined on this [[occasion]] to [[injustice]] and [[subject]] to error. thus, just
as a particular will cannot stand for the general will, the general
will, in turn, changes [[change]] its [[nature]], when its object is particular, and,
as general, cannot pronounce on a [[man]] or a [[fact]]. when, for instance,
the [[people]] of [[athens]] nominated or displaced its rulers, decreed
honours to one, and imposed penalties on another, and, by a multitude
of particular decrees, exercised all the functions of government
indiscriminately, it had in such cases no longer a general will in the
strict sense; it was acting no longer as [[sovereign]], but as magistrate.
this will seem contrary to current views; but i must be given [[time]] to
expound my own.

it should be seen from the foregoing that what makes the will general
is less the number of voters than the [[common]] interest uniting them;
for under this [[system]], each necessarily submits to the conditions he
imposes on others; and this admirable agreement between interest and
justice gives to the [[common]] deliberations an equitable [[character]] which
at once vanishes when any particular [[question]] is discussed, in the
absence of a [[common]] interest to unite and identify the ruling of the
judge with that of the party.

from whatever side we approach our [[principle]], we reach the same
conclusion, that the social compact sets up among the [[citizens]] an
equality of such a [[kind]], that they all bind themselves to observe the
same conditions and should therefore all enjoy the same rights [[right]]. thus,
from the very [[nature]] of the compact, every "act of sovereignty", _i.e._
every authentic act of the general will, binds or favours all the
citizens equally; so that the [[sovereign]] recognises only the [[body]] of the
nation, and draws no distinctions between those of whom it is made up.
what, then, strictly speaking is an act of sovereignty? it is not a
convention between a superior and an inferior, but a convention between
the [[body]] and each of its members. it is legitimate, because based on
the social contract, and, equitable, because [[common]] to all; useful,
because it can have no other object than the general [[good]], and stable,
because guaranteed by the [[public]] [[force]] and the supreme [[power]]. so long
as the subjects [[subject]] have to submit only to conventions of this sort, they
obey no-one but their own will; and to ask how far the respective
rights of the [[sovereign]] and the [[citizens]] extend, is to ask up to what
point the latter can enter into undertakings with themselves, each with
all, and all with each.

we can see from this that the [[sovereign]] [[power]], absolute, [[sacred]] and
inviolable as it is, does not and cannot exceed the limits of general
conventions, and that every [[man]] may dispose at will of such goods [[good]] and
liberty as these conventions leave him; so that the [[sovereign]] never has
a [[right]] to lay more charges on one [[subject]] than on another, because, in
that case, the [[question]] becomes particular, and ceases to be within its
competency.

when these distinctions have once been admitted, it is seen to be so
untrue that there is, in the social contract, any real renunciation
on the part of the individuals [[individual]], that the position in which they find
themselves as a result of the contract is really preferable to that in
which they were before. instead of a renunciation, they have made an
advantageous exchange: instead of an uncertain and precarious way of
living they have got one that is [[better]] and more secure; instead of
natural independence they have got [[liberty]], instead of the [[power]] to
harm others security for themselves, and instead of their [[strength]],
which others might overcome, a [[right]] which social union makes
invincible. their very [[life]], which they have devoted to the [[state]],
is by it constantly protected; and when they risk it in the state's
defence, what more are they doing than giving back what they have
received from it? what are they doing that they would not do more often
and with greater danger in the [[state]] of [[nature]], in which they would
inevitably have to [[fight]] battles [[battle]] at the peril of their lives [[life]] in defence
of that which is the means of their preservation? all have indeed to
fight when their [[country]] needs them; but then no one has ever to fight
for himself. do we not gain something by running, on behalf of what
gives us our security, only some of the risks we should have to run for
ourselves, as soon as we lost it?


[1] attentive readers, do not, i [[pray]], be in a hurry to charge me with
contradicting myself. the terminology made it unavoidable, considering
the [[poverty]] of the [[language]]; but wait and see.




chapter v

the [[right]] of [[life]] and death


the [[question]] is often [[asked]] how individuals [[individual]], having no [[right]] to dispose
of their own lives [[life]], can transfer to the [[sovereign]] a [[right]] which they
do not possess. the difficulty of answering this [[question]] seems to me
to [[lie]] in its being wrongly stated. every [[man]] has a [[right]] to risk his
own [[life]] in order to preserve it. has it ever, been said that a man
who throws himself out of the window to escape from a [[fire]] is guilty
of suicide? has such a crime ever been laid to the charge of him who
perishes in a storm because, when he went on board, he knew of the
danger?

the social treaty has for its end the preservation of the contracting
parties. he who wills the end wills the means also, and the means must
involve some risks, and even some losses. he who wishes [[wish]] to preserve
his [[life]] at others expense should also, when it is necessary, be
ready to give it up for their sake. furthermore, the citizen is no
longer the [[judge]] of the dangers to which the [[law]] desires [[desire]] him to expose
himself; and when the [[prince]] says to him: "it is expedient for the
state that you should [[die]]," he ought to [[die]], because it is only on that
condition that he has been living in security up to the [[present]], and
because his [[life]] is no longer a mere bounty of [[nature]], but a gift made
conditionally by the [[state]].

the death-penalty inflicted upon criminals [[criminal]] may be looked on in much the
same [[light]]: it is in order that we may not fall victims to an assassin
that we [[consent]] to [[die]] if we ourselves turn assassins. in this treaty,
so far from disposing of our own lives [[life]], we [[think]] only of securing
them, and it is not to be assumed that any of the parties then expects
to get [[hanged]].

again, every malefactor, by attacking social rights [[right]], becomes on forfeit
a rebel and a traitor to his [[country]]; by violating its laws [[law]] he ceases
to be a member of it; he even makes [[war]] upon it. in such a case the
preservation of the [[state]] is inconsistent with his own, and one or the
other must perish; in putting the guilty to [[death]], we slay not so much
the citizen as an [[enemy]]. the [[trial]] and the [[judgment]] are the proofs
that he has broken the social treaty, and is in consequence no longer
a member of the [[state]]. since, then, he has recognised himself to be
such by living there, he must be removed by [[exile]] as a violator of the
compact, or by [[death]] as a [[public]] [[enemy]]; for such an [[enemy]] is not a
moral [[person]], but merely a [[man]]; and in such a case the [[right]] of [[war]] is
to kill the vanquished.

but, it will be said, the condemnation of a [[criminal]] is a particular
act. i admit it: but such condemnation is not a function of the
sovereign; it is a [[right]] the [[sovereign]] can confer without being able
itself to exert it. all my ideas [[idea]] are consistent, but i cannot expound
them all at once.

we may add that frequent punishments [[punishment]] are always a sign of weakness
or remissness on the part of the [[government]]. there is not a single
ill-doer who could not be turned to some [[good]]. the [[state]] has no right
to put to [[death]], even for the sake of making an [[example]], any one whom
it can leave alive without danger.

the [[right]] of pardoning or exempting the guilty from a penalty imposed
by the [[law]] and pronounced by the [[judge]] belongs only to the authority
which is superior to both [[judge]] and [[law]], _i.e._ the [[sovereign]];
even its [[right]] in this matter is far from clear, and the cases for
exercising it are extremely rare. in a well-governed [[state]], there
are few punishments [[punishment]], not because there are many pardons, but because
criminals are rare; it is when a [[state]] is in decay that the multitude
of crimes is a guarantee of impunity. under the roman [[republic]], neither
the senate nor the consuls ever attempted to pardon; even the people
never did so, though it sometimes revoked its own decision. frequent
pardons mean that crime will soon need them no longer, and no-one can
help seeing whither that leads. but i [[feel]] my [[heart]] protesting and
restraining my pen; let us leave these questions [[question]] to the just [[man]] who
has never offended, and would himself stand in no need of pardon.




chapter vi

law


by the social compact we have given the [[body]] [[politic]] existence and
life: we have now by legislation to give it movement and will. for the
original act by which the [[body]] is formed and [[united]] still in no respect
determines what it ought to do for its preservation.

what is well and in conformity with order is so by the [[nature]] of
things and independently of [[human]] conventions. all [[justice]] comes from
god, who is its sole source; but if we knew how to receive so high an
inspiration, we should need neither [[government]] nor laws [[law]]. doubtless,
there is a universal [[justice]] emanating from [[reason]] alone; but this
justice, to be admitted among us, must be mutual. humanly speaking, in
default of [[natural]] sanctions, the laws [[law]] of [[justice]] are ineffective among
men: they merely make for the [[good]] of the wicked and the undoing of
the just, when the just [[man]] observes them towards everybody and nobody
observes them towards him. conventions and laws [[law]] are therefore needed to
join rights [[right]] to duties [[duty]] and refer [[justice]] to its object. in the [[state]] of
nature, where everything is [[common]], i owe nothing to him whom i nave
promised nothing; i recognise as belonging to others only what is of no
use to me. in the [[state]] of [[society]] all rights [[right]] are fixed by [[law]], and the
case becomes different.

but what, after all, is a [[law]]? as long as we remain satisfied with
attaching purely metaphysical ideas [[idea]] to the word, we shall go on arguing
without arriving at an understanding; and when we have defined a [[law]] of
nature, we shall be no nearer the definition of a [[law]] of the [[state]].

i have already said that there can be no general will directed to a
particular object. such an object must be either within or outside the
state. if outside, a will which is alien to it cannot be, in relation
to it, general; if within, it is part of the [[state]], and in that case
there arises a relation between whole and part which makes them two
separate beings, of which the part is one, and the whole minus the part
the other. but the whole minus a part cannot be the whole; and while
this relation persists, there can be no whole, but only two unequal
parts; and it follows that the will of one is no longer in any respect
general in relation to the other.

but when the whole [[people]] decrees for the whole [[people]], it is
considering only itself; and if a relation is then formed, it is
between two aspects of the entire object, without there being any
division of the whole. in that case the matter about which the decree
is made is, like the decreeing will general. this act is what i call a
law.

when i say that the object of laws [[law]] is always general, i mean that
law considers subjects [[subject]] _en masse_ and actions in the abstract, and
never a particular [[person]] or action. thus the [[law]] may indeed decree
that there shall be privileges [[privilege]], but cannot confer them on anybody by
name. it may set up several classes of [[citizens]], and even lay down
the qualifications for membership of these classes, but it cannot
nominate such and such persons [[person]] as belonging to them; it may establish a
monarchical [[government]] and hereditary succession, but it cannot choose
a [[king]], or nominate a [[royal]] [[family]]. in a word, no function which has a
particular object belongs to the legislative [[power]].

on this view, we at once see that it can no longer be [[asked]] whose
business it is to make laws [[law]], since they are acts of the general will:
nor whether the [[prince]] is above the [[law]], since he is a member of the
state; nor whether the [[law]] can be [[unjust]], since no one is [[unjust]] to
himself; nor how we can be both [[free]] and [[subject]] to the laws [[law]] since they
are but registers of our wills.

we see further that, as the [[law]] unites universality of will with
universality of object, what a [[man]], whoever he be, commands of his
own motion cannot be a [[law]]; and even what the [[sovereign]] commands with
regard to a particular matter is no nearer being a [[law]], but is a
decree, an act, not of sovereignty, but of magistracy.

i therefore give the name 'republic' to every [[state]] that is governed by
laws, no matter what the form of its administration may be: for only
in such a case does the [[public]] interest govern, and the _res publica_
rank as a _reality_. every legitimate [[government]] is republican;[1] what
government is i will explain later on.

laws are, properly speaking, only the conditions of civil association.
the [[people]], being [[subject]] to the laws [[law]], ought to be their author:
the conditions of the [[society]] ought to be regulated solely by those
who come together to form it. but how are they to regulate them? is
it to be by [[common]] agreement, by a sudden inspiration? has the body
politic an organ to declare its will? who can give it the foresight to
formulate and announce its acts in advance? or how is it to announce
them in the hour of need? how can a blind multitude, which often does
not [[know]] what it wills, because it rarely knows [[know]] what is [[good]] for it,
carry out for itself so [[great]] and difficult an enterprise as a system
of legislation? of itself the [[people]] wills always the [[good]], but of
itself it by no means always sees it. the general will is always in
the [[right]], but the [[judgment]] which guides it is not always enlightened.
it must be got to see objects as they are, and sometimes as they ought
to appear to it; it must be shown the [[good]] road it is in search of,
secured from the seductive influences of [[individual]] wills, taught to
see times [[time]] and spaces as a series, and made to weigh the attractions
of [[present]] and sensible advantages against the danger of distant and
hidden evils [[evil]]. the individuals [[individual]] see the [[good]] they reject; the public
wills the [[good]] it does not see. all stand equally in need of guidance.
the former must be compelled to bring their wills into conformity with
their [[reason]]; the latter must be taught to [[know]] what it wills. if that
is done, [[public]] enlightenment leads to the union of understanding and
will in the social [[body]]: the parts are made to [[work]] exactly together,
and the whole is raised to its highest [[power]]. this makes a legislator
necessary.


[1] i [[understand]] by this word, not merely an [[aristocracy]] or a
democracy, but generally any [[government]] directed by the general will,
which is the [[law]]. to be legitimate, the [[government]] must be, not one
with the [[sovereign]], but its minister. in such a case even a [[monarchy]] is
a [[republic]]. this will be made clearer in the following [[book]].




chapter vii

the legislator


in order to discover the rules [[rule]] of [[society]] [[best]] suited to nations,
a superior [[intelligence]] beholding all the [[passions]] of [[men]] without
experiencing any of them would be needed. this [[intelligence]] would have
to be wholly unrelated to our [[nature]], while knowing it through and
through; its [[happiness]] would have to be independent of us, and yet
ready to occupy itself with ours; and lastly, it would have, in the
march of [[time]], to look forward to a distant [[glory]], and, working in one
century, to be able to enjoy in the next.[1] it would take gods to give
men laws [[law]].

what caligula argued from the facts [[fact]], [[plato]], in the dialogue called the
_politicus_, argued in defining the civil or kingly [[man]], on the basis
of [[right]]. but if [[great]] princes [[prince]] are rare, how much more so are great
legislators? the former have only to [[follow]] the pattern which the
latter have to lay down. the legislator is the engineer who invents
the machine, the [[prince]] merely the mechanic who sets it up and makes
it go. "at the birth of societies [[society]]," says montesquieu, "the rulers of
republics establish [[institutions]], and afterwards the [[institutions]] mould
the rulers."[2]

he who dares to undertake the making of a people's [[institutions]] ought
to [[feel]] himself capable, so to speak, of changing [[human]] [[nature]], of
transforming each [[individual]], who is by himself a complete and solitary
whole, into part of a greater whole from which he in a manner receives
his [[life]] and being; of altering man's [[man]] [[constitution]] for the [[purpose]] of
strengthening it; and of substituting a partial and [[moral]] existence
for the physical and independent existence [[nature]] has conferred on
us all. he must, in a word, take away from [[man]] his own resources and
give him instead new ones alien to him, and incapable of being made
use of without the [[help]] of other [[men]]. the more completely these
natural resources are annihilated, the greater and the more lasting
are those which he acquires, and the more stable and [[perfect]] the new
institutions; so that if each citizen is nothing and can do nothing
without the rest, and the resources acquired by the whole are equal
or superior to the aggregate of the resources of all the individuals [[individual]],
it may be said that legislation is at the highest possible point of
perfection.

the legislator occupies in every [[respect]] an extraordinary position
in the [[state]]. if he should do so by [[reason]] of his genius, he does so
no less by [[reason]] of his office, which is neither magistracy, nor
sovereignty. this office, which sets up the [[republic]], nowhere enters
into its [[constitution]]; it is an [[individual]] and superior function, which
has nothing in [[common]] with [[human]] [[empire]]; for if he who holds command
over [[men]] ought not to have command over the laws [[law]], he who has command
over the laws [[law]] ought not any more to have it over [[men]]; or else his laws
would be the ministers of his [[passions]] and would often merely serve to
perpetuate his injustices: his private aims would inevitably mar the
sanctity of his [[work]].

when lycurgus gave laws [[law]] to his [[country]], he began by resigning
the [[throne]]. it was the custom of most [[greek]] towns to entrust the
establishment of their laws [[law]] to foreigners. the republics [[republic]] of modern
italy in many cases followed this [[example]]; geneva did the same and
profited by it.[3] [[rome]], when it was most prosperous, [[suffered]] a
revival of all the crimes of [[tyranny]], and was brought to the verge of
destruction, because it put the legislative [[authority]] and the sovereign
power into the same hands.

nevertheless, the decemvirs themselves never claimed the [[right]] to pass
any [[law]] merely on their own [[authority]]. "nothing we propose to you,"
they said to the [[people]], "can pass into [[law]] without your [[consent]].
romans, be yourselves the authors of the laws [[law]] which are to make you
happy."

he, therefore, who draws up the laws [[law]] has, or should have, no [[right]] of
legislation, and the [[people]] cannot, even if it wishes [[wish]], deprive itself
of this incommunicable [[right]], because, according to the fundamental
compact, only the general will can bind the individuals [[individual]], and there
can be no assurance that a particular will is in conformity with the
general will, until it has been put to the [[free]] vote of the [[people]].
this i have said already; but it is worth while to repeat it.

thus in the task of legislation we find together two things which
appear to be incompatible: an enterprise too difficult for human
powers, and, for its execution, an [[authority]] that is no [[authority]].

there is a further difficulty that deserves attention. [[wise]] [[men]], if
they try to speak their [[language]] to the [[common]] herd instead of its
own, cannot possibly make themselves understood. there are a thousand
kinds of ideas [[idea]] which it is impossible to translate into popular
language. conceptions that are too general and objects that are too
remote are equally out of its range: each [[individual]], having no taste
for any other plan of [[government]] than that which suits his particular
interest, finds it difficult to realise the advantages he might hope
to draw from the continual privations [[good]] laws [[law]] impose. for a young
people to be able to relish sound principles [[principle]] of [[political]] theory and
follow the fundamental rules [[rule]] of statecraft, the effect would have to
become the cause; the social spirit, which should be created by these
institutions, would have to preside over their very foundation; and men
would have to be before [[law]] what they should become by means of [[law]].
the legislator therefore, being unable to appeal to either [[force]] or
reason, must have recourse to an [[authority]] of a different order capable
of constraining without [[violence]] and persuading without convincing.

this is what has, in all ages [[age]], compelled the fathers [[father]] of nations to
have recourse to [[divine]] intervention and credit the gods with their
own [[wisdom]], in order that the peoples [[people]], submitting to the laws [[law]] of the
state as to those of [[nature]], and recognising the same [[power]] in the
formation of the [[city]] as in that of [[man]], might obey freely, and bear
with docility the yoke of the [[public]] [[happiness]].

this sublime [[reason]], far above the range of the [[common]] herd, is that
whose decisions the legislator puts into the mouth of the immortals [[immortal]],
in order to constrain by [[divine]] [[authority]] those whom [[human]] prudence
could not move.[4] but it is not anybody who can make the gods speak,
or get himself believed when he proclaims himself their interpreter.
the [[great]] [[soul]] of the legislator is the only miracle that can prove
his mission. any [[man]] may grave tablets of stone, or buy an oracle; or
feign secret intercourse with some divinity, or train a bird to whisper
in his ear, or find other vulgar ways of imposing on the [[people]]. he
whose [[knowledge]] goes no further may perhaps gather round him a band of
fools; but he will never found an [[empire]], and his extravagances will
quickly perish with him. idle tricks form a passing tie; only wisdom
can make it lasting. the judaic [[law]], which still subsists, and that
of the child of ishmael, which, for ten centuries, has ruled half the
world, still proclaim the [[great]] [[men]] who laid them down; and, while the
pride of [[philosophy]] or the blind spirit of faction sees in them no more
than lucky impostures, the true [[political]] theorist admires, in the
institutions they set up, the [[great]] and powerful genius which presides
over things made to endure.

we should not, with warburton, conclude from this that [[politics]] and
religion have among us a [[common]] object, but that, in the first periods
of nations, the one is used as an instrument for the other.


[1] a [[people]] becomes famous only when its legislation begins to
decline. we do not [[know]] for how many centuries the [[system]] of lycurgus
made the spartans [[happy]] before the rest of greece took any notice of it.

[2] montesquieu, _the greatness and decadence of the romans_, ch. i.

[3] those who [[know]] calvin only as a theologian much underestimate the
extent of his genius. the codification of our [[wise]] edicts, in which
he played a large part, does him no less [[honour]] than his _institute_.
whatever [[revolution]] [[time]] may bring in our [[religion]], so long as the
spirit of [[patriotism]] and [[liberty]] still lives [[life]] among us, the memory of
this [[great]] [[man]] will be for ever blessed.

[4] "in [[truth]]," says macchiavelli, "there has never been, in any
country, an extraordinary legislator who has not had recourse to [[god]];
for otherwise his laws [[law]] would not have been accepted: there are, in
fact, many useful truths [[truth]] of which a [[wise]] [[man]] may have [[knowledge]] without
their having in themselves such clear reasons [[reason]] for their being so as
to be able to convince others" (_discourses on livy_, bk. v, ch. xi).
(rousseau quotes the italian.)




chapter viii

the people


as, before putting up a large building, the architect surveys and
sounds the site to see if it will bear the weight, the [[wise]] legislator
does not begin by laying down laws [[law]] [[good]] in themselves, but by
investigating the fitness of the [[people]], for which they are destined,
to receive them. [[plato]] refused to legislate for the arcadians and the
cyrenæans, because he knew that both peoples [[people]] were [[rich]] and could not
put up with equality; and [[good]] laws [[law]] and [[bad]] [[men]] were found together
in crete, because minos had inflicted discipline on a [[people]] already
burdened with [[vice]].

a thousand nations have achieved earthly greatness, that could never
have endured [[good]] laws [[law]]; even such as could have endured them could
have done so only for a very brief period of their long [[history]]. most
peoples, like most [[men]], are docile only in [[youth]]; as they grow old they
become incorrigible. when once customs have become established and
prejudices inveterate, it is dangerous and useless to attempt their
reformation; the [[people]], like the foolish and cowardly patients who
rave at sight of the doctor, can no longer bear that any one should lay
hands on its faults [[fault]] to remedy them.

there are indeed times [[time]] in the [[history]] of states when, just as some
kinds of illness turn men's heads and make them forget the [[past]],
periods of [[violence]] and revolutions [[revolution]] do to peoples [[people]] what these crises do
to individuals [[individual]]: [[horror]] of the [[past]] takes the place of forgetfulness,
and the [[state]], set on [[fire]] by civil wars [[war]], is born again, so to speak,
from its ashes, and takes on anew, fresh from the jaws of [[death]], the
vigour of [[youth]]. such were sparta at the [[time]] of lycurgus, [[rome]] after
the tarquins, and, in [[modern]] times [[time]], holland and switzerland after the
expulsion of the tyrants [[tyrant]].

but such events are rare; they are exceptions, the cause of which
is always to be found in the particular [[constitution]] of the state
concerned. they cannot even happen twice to the same [[people]], for it
can make itself [[free]] as long as it remains barbarous, but not when the
civic impulse has lost its vigour. then disturbances may [[destroy]] it,
but revolutions [[revolution]] cannot mend it: it needs a master, and not a liberator.
free peoples [[people]], be mindful of [[maxim]]; "liberty may be gained, but can
never be recovered."

youth is not infancy. there is for nations, as for [[men]], a period of
youth, or, shall we say, maturity, before which they should not be
made [[subject]] to laws [[law]]; but the maturity of a [[people]] is not always
easily recognisable, and, if it is anticipated, the [[work]] is spoilt.
one [[people]] is amenable to discipline from the beginning; another, not
after ten centuries. russia will never be really civilised, because
it was civilised too soon. peter had a genius for imitation; but he
lacked true genius, which is creative and makes all from nothing. he
did some [[good]] things, but most of what he did was out of place. he
saw that his [[people]] was barbarous, but did not see that it was not
ripe for civilisation: he wanted to civilise it when it needed only
hardening. his first [[wish]] was to make germans or englishmen, when he
ought to have been making russians; and he prevented his subjects [[subject]] from
ever becoming what they might have been by persuading them that they
were what they are not. in this [[fashion]] too a french teacher turns out
his pupil to be an infant prodigy, and for the rest of his [[life]] to be
nothing whatsoever. the [[empire]] of russia will aspire to conquer [[europe]],
and will itself be conquered. the tartars, its subjects [[subject]] or neighbours,
will become its masters and ours, by a [[revolution]] which i regard as
inevitable. indeed, all the kings [[king]] of [[europe]] are working in concert to
hasten its coming.




chapter ix

the [[people]] (_continued_)


as [[nature]] has set bounds to the stature of a well-made [[man]], and,
outside those limits, makes nothing but giants or dwarfs, similarly,
for the [[constitution]] of a [[state]] to be at its [[best]], it is possible to
fix limits that will make it neither too large for [[good]] [[government]],
nor too small for self-maintenance. in every [[body]] [[politic]] there is
a _maximum_ [[strength]] which it cannot exceed and which it only loses
by increasing in size. every extension of the social tie means its
relaxation; and, generally speaking, a small [[state]] is stronger in
proportion than a [[great]] one.

a thousand arguments could be advanced in favour of this [[principle]].
first, long distances make administration more difficult, just as a
weight becomes heavier at the end of a longer lever. administration
therefore becomes more and more burdensome as the distance grows
greater; for, in the first place, each [[city]] has its own, which is
paid for by the [[people]]: each district its own, still paid for by the
people: then comes each province, and then the [[great]] governments [[government]],
satrapies, and vice-royalties, always costing more the higher you go,
and always at the expense of the unfortunate [[people]]. [[last]] of all comes
the supreme administration, which eclipses all the rest. all these
overcharges are a continual drain upon the subjects [[subject]]; so far from being
better governed by all these different orders, they are worse governed
than if there were only a [[single]] [[authority]] over them. in the meantime,
there scarce remain resources enough to meet emergencies; and, when
recourse must be had to these, the [[state]] is always on the eve of
destruction.

this is not all; not only has the [[government]] less vigour and
promptitude for securing the observance of the laws [[law]], preventing
nuisances, correcting abuses [[abuse]], and guarding against seditious
undertakings begun in distant places; the [[people]] has less affection for
its rulers, whom it never sees, for its [[country]], which, to its [[eyes]],
seems like the [[world]], and for its fellow-citizens, most of whom are
unknown to it. the same laws [[law]] cannot suit so many diverse provinces with
different customs, situated in the most various climates, and incapable
of enduring a uniform [[government]]. different laws [[law]] lead only to trouble
and confusion among peoples [[people]] which, living under the same rulers and in
constant communication one with another, intermingle and intermarry,
and, coming under the sway of new customs, never [[know]] if they can call
their very patrimony their own. talent is buried, [[virtue]] unknown and
vice unpunished, among such a multitude of [[men]] who do not [[know]] one
another, gathered together in one place at the seat of the central
administration. the leaders, overwhelmed with [[business]], see nothing
for themselves; the [[state]] is governed by clerks. finally, the measures
which have to be taken to, maintain the general [[authority]], which all
these distant officials [[wish]] to escape or to impose upon, absorb all
the energy of the [[public]], so that there is none left for the happiness
of the [[people]]. there is hardly enough to defend it when need arises,
and thus a [[body]] which is too big for its [[constitution]] gives way and
falls crushed under its own weight.

again, the [[state]] must assure itself a safe foundation, if it is to
have stability, and to be able to resist the shocks it cannot help
experiencing, as well as the efforts it will be forced to make for
its maintenance; for all peoples [[people]] have a [[kind]] of centrifugal force
that makes them continually act one against another, and tend to
aggrandise themselves at their neighbours' expense, like the vortices
of descartes. thus the [[weak]] run the risk of being soon swallowed up;
and it is almost impossible for any one to preserve itself except by
putting itself in a [[state]] of equilibrium with all, so that the pressure
is on all sides practically [[equal]].

it may therefore be seen that there are reasons [[reason]] for expansion and
reasons for contraction; and it is no small part of the statesman's
skill to hit between them the mean that is most favourable to the
preservation of the [[state]]. it may be said that the [[reason]] for
expansion, being merely external and relative, ought to be subordinate
to the reasons [[reason]] for contraction, which are internal and absolute. a
strong and healthy [[constitution]] is the first thing to look for; and it
is [[better]] to count on the vigour which comes of [[good]] [[government]] than on
the resources a [[great]] territory furnishes.

it may be added that there have been known states so constituted that
the necessity of making conquests entered into their very [[constitution]],
and that, in order to maintain themselves, they were forced to expand
ceaselessly. it may be that they congratulated themselves greatly on
this fortunate necessity, which none the less indicated to them, along
with the limits of their greatness, the inevitable moment of their fall.




chapter x

the [[people]] (_continued_)


a [[body]] [[politic]] may be measured in two ways--either by the extent of its
territory, or by the number of its [[people]]; and there is, between these
two measurements, a [[right]] relation which makes the [[state]] really [[great]].
the [[men]] make the [[state]], and the territory sustains the [[men]]; the right
relation therefore is that the [[land]] should suffice for the maintenance
of the inhabitants, and that there should be as many inhabitants as
the [[land]] can maintain. in this proportion lies [[lie]] the _maximum_ strength
of a given number of [[people]]; for if there is too much [[land]], it is
troublesome to guard and inadequately cultivated, produces [[produce]] more than is
needed, and soon gives rise to wars [[war]] of defence; if there is not enough,
the [[state]] depends on its neighbours for what it needs over and above,
and this soon gives rise to wars [[war]] of offence. every [[people]], to which
its situation gives no [[choice]] save that between commerce and [[war]], is
weak in itself: it depends on its neighbours, and on circumstances;
its existence can never be more than short and uncertain. it either
conquers others, and changes [[change]] its situation, or it is conquered and
becomes nothing. only insignificance or greatness can keep it [[free]].

no fixed relation can be stated between the extent of the territory
and the [[population]] that are adequate one to the other, both because
of the differences in the quality of [[land]], in its fertility, in the
nature of its products, and in the influence of [[climate]], and because of
the different tempers of those who inhabit it; for some in a fertile
country consume little, and others on an ungrateful soil much. the
greater or less fecundity of [[women]], the conditions that are more or
less favourable in each [[country]] to the [[growth]] of [[population]], and the
influence the legislator can [[hope]] to exercise by his [[institutions]], must
also be taken into account. the legislator therefore should not go
by what he sees, but by what he foresees; he should stop not so much
at the [[state]] in which he actually finds the [[population]], as at that
to which it ought naturally to attain. lastly, there are countless
cases in which the particular local circumstances demand or allow
the acquisition of a greater territory than seems necessary. thus,
expansion will be [[great]] in a mountainous [[country]], where the natural
products, _i.e._ woods and pastures, need less [[labour]], where we know
from [[experience]] that [[women]] are more fertile than in the plains, and
where a [[great]] expanse of slope affords only a small level tract that
can be counted on for vegetation. on the other hand, contraction is
possible on the coast, even in lands [[land]] of rocks and nearly barren sands,
because there fishing makes up to a [[great]] extent for the lack of
land-produce, because the inhabitants have to congregate together more
in order to repel pirates, and further because it is easier to unburden
the [[country]] of its superfluous inhabitants by means of colonies.

to these conditions of law-giving must be added one other which,
though it cannot take the place of the rest, renders them all useless
when it is absent. this is the enjoyment of [[peace]] and plenty; for the
moment at which a [[state]] sets its house in order is, like the moment
when a battalion is forming up, that when its [[body]] is least capable of
offering [[resistance]] and easiest to [[destroy]]. a [[better]] [[resistance]] could
be made at a [[time]] of absolute disorganisation than at a moment of
fermentation, when each is occupied with his own position and not with
the danger. if [[war]], famine, or sedition arises at this [[time]] of crisis,
the [[state]] will inevitably be overthrown.

not that many governments [[government]] have not been set up during such storms; but
in such cases these governments [[government]] are themselves the state's destroyers.
usurpers always bring about or select troublous times [[time]] to get passed,
under cover of the [[public]] terror, destructive laws [[law]], which the people
would never adopt in cold [[blood]]. the moment chosen is one of the surest
means of distinguishing the [[work]] of the legislator from that of the
tyrant.

what [[people]], then, is a fit [[subject]] for legislation? one which,
already bound by some unity of origin, interest, or convention, has
never yet [[felt]] the real yoke of [[law]]; one that has neither customs nor
superstitions deeply ingrained, one which stands in no [[fear]] of being
overwhelmed by sudden [[invasion]]; one which, without entering into its
neighbours' quarrels, can resist each of them single-handed, or get the
help of one to repel another; one in which every member may be known by
every other, and there is no need to lay on any [[man]] burdens too heavy
for a [[man]] to bear; one which can do without other peoples [[people]], and without
which all others can do;[1] one which is neither [[rich]] nor [[poor]], but
self-sufficient; and, lastly, one which unites the consistency of an
ancient [[people]] with the docility of a new one. legislation is made
difficult less by what it is necessary to build up than by what has to
be destroyed; and what makes [[success]] so rare is the impossibility of
finding [[natural]] simplicity together with social requirements. all these
conditions are indeed rarely found [[united]], and therefore few states
have [[good]] constitutions [[constitution]].

there is still in [[europe]] one [[country]] capable of being given
laws--corsica. the valour and persistency with which that brave people
has regained and defended its [[liberty]] well deserves that some [[wise]] man
should [[teach]] it how to preserve what it has won. i have a feeling that
some day that little island will astonish [[europe]].


[1] if there were two neighbouring peoples [[people]], one of which could not
do without the other, it would be very hard on the former, and very
dangerous for the latter. every [[wise]] nation, in such a case, would make
haste to [[free]] the other from dependence. the [[republic]] of thlascala,
enclosed by the mexican [[empire]], preferred doing without salt to
buying from the mexicans, or even getting it from them as a gift
the thlascalans were [[wise]] enough to see the snare hidden under such
liberality. they kept their [[freedom]], and that little [[state]], shut up in
that [[great]] [[empire]], was finally the instrument of its ruin.




chapter xi

the various systems [[system]] of legislation


if we ask in what precisely consists the [[greatest]] [[good]] of all, which
should be the end of every [[system]] of legislation, we shall find it
reduce itself to two main objects, [[liberty]] and equality--liberty,
because all particular dependence means so much [[force]] taken from the
body of the [[state]], and equality, because [[liberty]] cannot [[exist]] without
it.

i have already defined civil [[liberty]]; by equality, we should
understand, not that the degrees [[degree]] of [[power]] and riches [[rich]] are to be
absolutely identical for everybody; but that [[power]] shall never be
great enough for [[violence]], and shall always be exercised by [[virtue]] of
rank and [[law]]; and that, in [[respect]] of riches [[rich]], no citizen shall ever be
wealthy enough to buy another, and none [[poor]] enough to be forced to
sell himself:[1] which implies, on the part of the [[great]], moderation
in goods [[good]] and position, and, on the side of the [[common]] sort, moderation
in avarice and covetousness.

such equality, we are told, is an unpractical ideal that cannot
actually [[exist]]. but if its [[abuse]] is inevitable, does it [[follow]] that we
should not at least make regulations concerning it? it is precisely
because the [[force]] of circumstances tends continually to destroy
equality that the [[force]] of legislation should always tend to its
maintenance.

but these general objects of every [[good]] legislative [[system]] need
modifying in every [[country]] in accordance with the local situation
and the temper of the inhabitants; and these circumstances should
determine, in each case, the particular [[system]] of [[institutions]] which
is [[best]], not perhaps in itself, but for the [[state]] for which it is
destined. if, for instance, the soil is barren and unproductive, or
the [[land]] too crowded for its inhabitants, the [[people]] should turn
to industry and the crafts, and exchange what they [[produce]] for the
commodities they lack. if, on the other hand, a [[people]] dwells in rich
plains and fertile slopes, or, in a [[good]] [[land]], lacks inhabitants, it
should give all its attention to agriculture, which causes [[men]] to
multiply, and should drive out the crafts, which would only result in
depopulation, by grouping in a few localities the few inhabitants there
are.[2] if a nation dwells on an extensive and convenient coast-line,
let it cover the sea with ships and foster commerce and navigation. it
will have a [[life]] that will be short and glorious. if, on its coasts,
the sea washes nothing but almost inaccessible rocks, let it remain
barbarous and ichthyophagous: it will have a quieter, perhaps a [[better]],
and certainly a happier [[life]]. in a word, besides the principles [[principle]] that
are [[common]] to all, every nation has in itself something that gives them
a particular application, and makes its legislation peculiarly its own.
thus, among the [[jews]] long ago and more recently among the arabs, the
chief object was [[religion]], among the athenians letters, at [[carthage]] and
tyre commerce, at rhodes shipping, at sparta [[war]], at [[rome]] [[virtue]]. the
author of _the spirit of the laws_ has shown with many examples [[example]] by
what art [[arts]] the legislator directs the [[constitution]] towards each of these
objects.

what makes the [[constitution]] of a [[state]] really solid and lasting is
the due observance of what is proper, so that the [[natural]] relations
are always in agreement with the laws [[law]] on every point, and [[law]] only
serves, so to speak, to assure, accompany and rectify them. but if
the legislator mistakes his object and adopts a [[principle]] other than
circumstances naturally direct; if his [[principle]] makes for servitude
while they make for [[liberty]], or if it makes for riches [[rich]], while they
make for populousness, or if it makes for [[peace]], while they make
for conquest--the laws [[law]] will insensibly lose their influence, the
constitution will alter, and the [[state]] will have no rest from trouble
till it is either destroyed or changed, and [[nature]] has resumed her
invincible sway.


[1] if the object is to give the [[state]] consistency, bring the two
extremes as near to each other as possible; allow neither [[rich]] men
nor beggars. these two estates, which are naturally inseparable, are
equally fatal to the [[common]] [[good]]; from the one come the [[friends]] of
tyranny, and from the other tyrants [[tyrant]]. it is always between them that
public [[liberty]] is put up to auction; the one buys, and the other sells.

[2] "any branch of [[foreign]] commerce," says m. d'argenson, "creates on
the whole only apparent advantage for the [[kingdom]] in general; it may
enrich some individuals [[individual]], or even some towns; but the nation as a whole
gains nothing by it, and the [[people]] is no [[better]] off."




chapter xii

the division of the laws


if the whole is to be set in order, and the commonwealth put into the
best possible shape, there are various relations to be considered.
first, there is the action of the complete [[body]] upon itself, the
relation of the whole to the whole, of the [[sovereign]] to the [[state]]; and
this relation, as we shall see, is made up of the relations of the
intermediate terms.

the laws [[law]] which regulate this relation bear the name of [[political]] laws [[law]],
and are also called fundamental laws [[law]], not without [[reason]] if they are
wise. for, if there is, in each [[state]], only one [[good]] [[system]], the
people that is in possession of it should hold fast to this; but if
the established order is [[bad]], why should laws [[law]] that prevent [[men]] from
being [[good]] be regarded as fundamental? besides, in any case, a people
is always in a position to [[change]] its laws [[law]], however [[good]]; for, if it
choose to do itself harm, who can have a [[right]] to stop it?

the second relation is that of the members one to another, or to the
body as a whole; and this relation should be in the first [[respect]] as
unimportant, and in the second as important, as possible. each citizen
would then be perfectly independent of all the rest, and at the same
time very dependent on the [[city]]; which is brought about always by the
same means, as the [[strength]] of the [[state]] can alone secure the liberty
of its members. from this second relation arise civil laws [[law]].

we may consider also a third [[kind]] of relation between the individual
and the [[law]], a relation of disobedience to its penalty. this gives
rise to the setting up of [[criminal]] laws [[law]], which, at bottom, are less a
particular class of [[law]] than the sanction behind all the rest.

along with these three kinds [[kind]] of [[law]] goes a fourth, most important of
all, which is not graven on tablets of marble or brass, but on the
hearts of the [[citizens]]. this forms the real [[constitution]] of the [[state]],
takes on every day new powers [[power]], when other laws [[law]] decay or [[die]] out,
restores them or takes their place, keeps a [[people]] in the ways in which
it was meant to go, and insensibly replaces [[authority]] by the force
of habit. i am speaking of morality, of custom, above all of public
opinion; a [[power]] unknown to [[political]] thinkers, on which none the less
success in everything else depends. with this the [[great]] legislator
concerns himself in secret, though he seems to confine himself to
particular regulations; for these are only the arc of the arch, while
manners and morals [[moral]], slower to arise, form in the end its immovable
keystone.

among the different classes of laws [[law]], the [[political]], which determine the
form of the [[government]], are alone relevant to my [[subject]].




book iii


before speaking of the different forms of [[government]], let us try to
fix the exact sense of the word, which has not yet been very clearly
explained.




chapter i

government in general


i warn the reader that this [[chapter]] requires careful reading, and that
i am unable to make myself clear to those who refuse to be attentive.

every [[free]] action is produced by the concurrence of two causes; one
moral, _i.e._ the will which determines the act; the other physical,
_i.e._ the [[power]] which executes it. when i walk towards an object, it
is necessary first that i should will to go there, and, in the second
place, that my feet should carry me. if a paralytic wills to run and
an active [[man]] wills not to, they will both stay where they are. the
body [[politic]] has the same motive powers [[power]]; here too [[force]] and will are
distinguished, will under the name of legislative [[power]] and [[force]] under
that of executive [[power]]. without their concurrence, nothing is, or
should be, done.

we have seen that the legislative [[power]] belongs to the [[people]], and can
belong to it alone. it may, on the other hand, readily be seen, from
the principles [[principle]] laid down above, that the executive [[power]] cannot belong
to the generality as legislature or [[sovereign]], because it consists
wholly of particular acts which fall outside the competency of the [[law]],
and consequently of the [[sovereign]], whose acts must always be laws [[law]].

the [[public]] [[force]] therefore needs an agent of its own to bind it
together and set it to [[work]] under the direction of the general will, to
serve as a means of communication between the [[state]] and the [[sovereign]],
and to do for the collective [[person]] more or less what the union of soul
and [[body]] does for [[man]]. here we have what is, in the [[state]], the basis of
government, often wrongly confused with the [[sovereign]], whose minister
it is.

what then is [[government]]? an intermediate [[body]] set up between the
subjects and the [[sovereign]], to secure their mutual correspondence,
charged with the execution of the laws [[law]] and the maintenance of [[liberty]],
both civil and [[political]].

the members of this [[body]] are called magistrates or _kings_, that is to
say _governors_, and the whole [[body]] bears the name _prince_.[1] thus
those who hold that the act, by which a [[people]] puts itself under a
prince, is not a contract, are certainly [[right]]. it is simply and solely
a commission, an employment, in which the rulers, mere officials of the
sovereign, exercise in their own name the [[power]] of which it makes them
depositaries. this [[power]] it can limit, modify or recover at [[pleasure]];
for the alienation of such a [[right]] is incompatible with the [[nature]] of
the social [[body]], and contrary to the end of association.

i call then _government_, or supreme administration, the legitimate
exercise of the executive [[power]], and [[prince]] or magistrate the [[man]] or
the [[body]] entrusted with that administration.

in [[government]] reside the intermediate forces [[force]] whose relations make up
that of the whole to the whole, or of the [[sovereign]] to the [[state]]. this
last relation may be represented as that between the extreme terms of a
continuous proportion, which has [[government]] as its mean proportional.
the [[government]] gets from the [[sovereign]] the orders it gives the [[people]],
and, for the [[state]] to be properly balanced, there must, when everything
is reckoned in, be equality between the product or [[power]] of the
government taken in itself, and the product or [[power]] of the [[citizens]],
who are on the one hand [[sovereign]] and on the other [[subject]].

furthermore, none of these three terms can be altered without the
equality being instantly destroyed. if the [[sovereign]] desires [[desire]] to govern,
or the magistrate to give laws [[law]], or if the subjects [[subject]] refuse to obey,
disorder takes the place of regularity, [[force]] and will no longer act
together, and the [[state]] is dissolved and falls into despotism or
anarchy. lastly, as there is only one mean proportional between each
relation, there is also only one [[good]] [[government]] possible for a [[state]].
but, as countless events may [[change]] the relations of a [[people]], not only
may different governments [[government]] be [[good]] for different peoples [[people]], but also for
the same [[people]] at different times [[time]].

in attempting to give some [[idea]] of the various relations that may hold
between these two extreme terms, i shall take as an [[example]] the number
of a [[people]], which is the most easily expressible.

suppose the [[state]] is composed of ten thousand [[citizens]]. the sovereign
can only be considered collectively and as a [[body]]; but each member, as
being a [[subject]], is regarded as an [[individual]]: thus the [[sovereign]] is
to the [[subject]] as ten thousand to one, _i.e._ each member of the state
has as his share only a ten-thousandth part of the [[sovereign]] [[authority]],
although he is wholly under its control. if the [[people]] numbers a
hundred thousand, the condition of the [[subject]] undergoes no [[change]],
and each equally is under the whole [[authority]] of the laws [[law]], while his
vote, being reduced to one hundred thousandth part, has ten times [[time]] less
influence in drawing them up. the [[subject]] therefore remaining always
a unit, the relation between him and the [[sovereign]] increases with the
number of the [[citizens]]. from this it follows that, the larger the
state, the less the [[liberty]].

when i say the relation increases, i mean that it grows more unequal.
thus the greater it is in the geometrical sense, the less relation
there is in the ordinary sense of the word. in the former sense,
the relation, considered according to quantity, is expressed by the
quotient; in the latter, considered according to identity, it is
reckoned by similarity.

now, the less relation the particular wills have to the general will,
that is, morals [[moral]] and manners to laws [[law]], the more should the repressive
force be increased. the [[government]], then, to be [[good]], should be
proportionately stronger as the [[people]] is more numerous.

on the other hand, as the [[growth]] of the [[state]] gives the depositaries
of the [[public]] [[authority]] more temptations and chances [[chance]] of abusing their
power, the greater the [[force]] with which the [[government]] ought to be
endowed for keeping the [[people]] in hand, the greater too should be the
force at the disposal of the [[sovereign]] for keeping the [[government]] in
hand. i am speaking, not of absolute [[force]], but of the relative force
of the different parts of the [[state]].

it follows from this double relation that the continuous proportion
between the [[sovereign]], the [[prince]] and the [[people]], is by no means an
arbitrary [[idea]], but a necessary consequence of the [[nature]] of the body
politic. it follows further that, one of the extreme terms, viz. the
people, as [[subject]], being fixed and represented by unity, whenever the
duplicate ratio increases or diminishes, the simple ratio does the
same, and is changed accordingly. from this we see that there is not a
single unique and absolute form of [[government]], but as many governments
differing in [[nature]] as there are states differing in size.

if, ridiculing this [[system]], any one were to say that, in order to find
the mean proportional and give form to the [[body]] of the [[government]],
it is only necessary, according to me, to find the square root of
the number of the [[people]], i should [[answer]] that i am here taking this
number only as an instance; that the relations of which i am speaking
are not measured by the number of [[men]] alone, but generally by the
amount of action, which is a combination of a multitude of causes; and
that, further, if, to save words, i borrow for a moment the terms of
geometry, i am none the less well aware that [[moral]] quantities do not
allow of geometrical accuracy.

the [[government]] is on a small scale what the [[body]] [[politic]] which includes
it is on a [[great]] one. it is a [[moral]] [[person]] endowed with certain
faculties, active like the [[sovereign]] and passive like the [[state]],
and capable of being resolved into other similar relations. this
accordingly gives rise to a new proportion, within which there is yet
another, according to the arrangement of the magistracies, till an
indivisible middle term is reached, _i.e._ a [[single]] ruler or supreme
magistrate, who may be represented, in the midst of this progression,
as the unity between the fractional and the ordinal series.

without encumbering ourselves with this multiplication of terms, let us
rest content with regarding [[government]] as a new [[body]] within the [[state]],
distinct from the [[people]] and the [[sovereign]], and intermediate between
them.

there is between these two bodies [[body]] this essential difference, that
the [[state]] exists by itself, and the [[government]] only through the
sovereign. thus the dominant will of the [[prince]] is, or should be,
nothing but the general will or the [[law]]; his [[force]] is only the public
force concentrated in his hands, and, as soon as he tries to base
any absolute and independent act on his own [[authority]], the tie that
binds the whole together begins to be loosened. if finally the prince
should come to have a particular will more active than the will of the
sovereign, and should employ the [[public]] [[force]] in his hands in obedience
to this particular will, there would be, so to speak, two sovereigns [[sovereign]],
one rightful and the other actual, the social union would evaporate
instantly, and the [[body]] [[politic]] would be dissolved.

however, in order that the [[government]] may have a true existence
and a real [[life]] distinguishing it from the [[body]] of the [[state]], and
in order that all its members may be able to act in concert and
fulfil the end for which it was set up, it must have a particular
personality, a sensibility [[common]] to its members, and a [[force]] and will
of its own making for its preservation. this particular existence
implies assemblies, councils, [[power]] of deliberation and decision,
rights, titles, and privileges [[privilege]] belonging exclusively to the prince
and making the office of magistrate more honourable in proportion
as it is more troublesome. the difficulties [[lie]] in the manner of so
ordering this subordinate whole within the whole, that it in no way
alters the general [[constitution]] by affirmation of its own, and always
distinguishes the particular [[force]] it possesses, which is destined
to aid in its preservation, from the [[public]] [[force]], which is destined
to the preservation of the [[state]]; and, in a word, is always ready to
sacrifice the [[government]] to the [[people]], and never to [[sacrifice]] the
people to the [[government]].

furthermore, although the artificial [[body]] of the [[government]] is the work
of another artificial [[body]], and has, we may say, only a borrowed and
subordinate [[life]], this does not prevent it from being able to act with
more or less vigour or promptitude, or from being, so to speak, in more
or less robust health. finally, without departing directly from the
end for which it was instituted, it may deviate more or less from it,
according to the manner of its [[constitution]].

from all these differences arise the various relations which the
government ought to bear to the [[body]] of the [[state]], according to the
accidental and particular relations by which the [[state]] itself is
modified, for often the [[government]] that is [[best]] in itself will become
the most pernicious, if the relations in which it stands have altered
according to the defects of the [[body]] [[politic]] to which it belongs.


[1] thus at venice the college, even in the absence of the doge, is
called "most serene [[prince]]."




chapter ii

the constituent [[principle]] in the various forms of government


to set forth the general cause of the above differences, we must here
distinguish between [[government]] and its [[principle]], as we did before
between the [[state]] and the [[sovereign]].

the [[body]] of the magistrate may be composed of a greater or a less
number of members. we said that the relation of the [[sovereign]] to the
subjects was greater in proportion as the [[people]] was more numerous,
and, by a clear analogy, we may say the same of the relation of the
government to the magistrates.

but the total [[force]] of the [[government]], being always that of the [[state]],
is invariable; so that, the more of this [[force]] it expends on its own
members, the less it has left to employ on the whole [[people]].

the more numerous the magistrates, therefore, the weaker the
government. this [[principle]] being fundamental, we must do our [[best]] to
make it clear.

in the [[person]] of the magistrate we can distinguish three essentially
different wills: first, the private will of the [[individual]], tending
only to his personal advantage; secondly, the [[common]] will of the
magistrates, which is relative solely to the advantage of the [[prince]],
and may be called corporate will, being general in relation to the
government, and particular in relation to the [[state]], of which the
government forms part; and, in the third place, the will of the people
or the [[sovereign]] will, which is general both in relation to the state
regarded as the whole, and to the [[government]] regarded as a part of the
whole.

in a [[perfect]] act of legislation, the [[individual]] or particular will
should be at zero; the corporate will belonging to the government
should occupy a very subordinate position; and, consequently, the
general or [[sovereign]] will should always predominate and should be the
sole guide of all the rest.

according to the [[natural]] order, on the other hand, these different
wills become more active in proportion as they are concentrated. thus,
the general will is always the weakest, the corporate will second, and
the [[individual]] will strongest of all: so that, in the [[government]], each
member is first of all himself, then a magistrate, and then a citizen
--in an order exactly the reverse of what the social [[system]] requires.

this granted, if the whole [[government]] is in the hands of one [[man]], the
particular and the corporate will are wholly [[united]], and consequently
the latter is at its highest possible [[degree]] of intensity. but, as the
use to which the [[force]] is put depends on the [[degree]] reached by the
will, and as the absolute [[force]] of the [[government]] is invariable, it
follows that the most active [[government]] is that of one [[man]].

suppose, on the other hand, we unite the [[government]] with the
legislative [[authority]], and make the [[sovereign]] [[prince]] also, and all the
citizens so many magistrates: then the corporate will, being confounded
with the general will, can possess no greater activity than that will,
and must leave the particular will as [[strong]] as it can possibly be.
thus, the [[government]], having always the same absolute [[force]], will be at
the lowest point of its relative [[force]] or activity.

these relations are incontestable, and there are other considerations
which still further confirm them. we can see, for instance, that
each magistrate is more active in the [[body]] to which he belongs than
each citizen in that to which he belongs, and that consequently the
particular will has much more influence on the acts of the government
than on those of the [[sovereign]]; for each magistrate is almost always
charged with some governmental function, while each citizen, taken
singly, exercises no function of sovereignty. furthermore, the bigger
the [[state]] grows, the more its real [[force]] increases, though not in
direct proportion to its [[growth]]; but, the [[state]] remaining the same,
the number of magistrates may increase to any extent, without the
government gaining any greater real [[force]]; for its [[force]] is that of the
state, the dimension of which remains [[equal]]. thus the relative [[force]] or
activity of the [[government]] decreases, while its absolute or real force
cannot increase.

moreover, it is a certainty that promptitude in execution diminishes
as more [[people]] are put in charge of it: where prudence is made too
much of, not enough is made of [[fortune]]; opportunity is let slip, and
deliberation results in the loss of its object.

i have just proved that the [[government]] grows remiss in proportion as
the number of the magistrates increases; and i previously proved that,
the more numerous the [[people]], the greater should be the repressive
force. from this it follows that the relation of the magistrates to the
government should vary inversely to the relation of the subjects [[subject]] to the
sovereign; that is to say, the larger the [[state]], the more should the
government be tightened, so that the number of the rulers diminish in
proportion to the increase of that of the [[people]].

it should be added that i am here speaking of the relative [[strength]] of
the [[government]], and not of its rectitude: for, on the other hand, the
more numerous the magistracy, the nearer the corporate will comes to
the general will; while, under a [[single]] magistrate, the corporate will
is, as i said, merely a particular will. thus, what may be gained on
one side is lost on the other, and the art [[arts]] of the legislator is to know
how to fix the point at which the [[force]] and the will of the [[government]],
which are always in inverse proportion, meet in the relation that is
most to the advantage of the [[state]].




chapter iii

the division of governments


we saw in the [[last]] [[chapter]] what causes the various kinds [[kind]] or forms of
government to be distinguished according to the number of the members
composing them: it remains in this to discover how the division is made.

in the first place, the [[sovereign]] may commit the charge of the
government to the whole [[people]] or to the majority of the [[people]], so
that more [[citizens]] are magistrates than are mere private individuals [[individual]].
this form of [[government]] is called _democracy_.

or it may restrict the [[government]] to a small number; so that there are
more private [[citizens]] than magistrates; and this is named _aristocracy_.

lastly, it may concentrate the whole [[government]] in the hands of a
single magistrate from whom all others hold their [[power]]. this third
form is the most usual, and is called _monarchy_, or [[royal]] [[government]].

it should be remarked that all these forms, or at least the first two,
admit of [[degree]], and even of very wide differences; for [[democracy]] may
include the whole [[people]], or may be restricted to half. [[aristocracy]], in
its turn, may be restricted indefinitely from half the [[people]] down to
the smallest possible number. even royalty is susceptible of a measure
of distribution. sparta always had two kings [[king]], as its constitution
provided; and the roman [[empire]] saw as many as eight emperors [[emperor]] at once,
without it being possible to say that the [[empire]] was split up. thus
there is a point at which each form of [[government]] passes into the next,
and it becomes clear that, under three comprehensive denominations,
government is really susceptible of as many diverse forms as the state
has [[citizens]].

there are even more: for, as the [[government]] may also, in certain
aspects, be subdivided into other parts, one administered in one
fashion and one in another, the combination of the three forms
may result in a multitude of mixed forms, each of which admits of
multiplication by all the simple forms.

there has been at all times [[time]] much dispute concerning the [[best]] form of
government, without consideration of the [[fact]] that each is in some
cases the [[best]], and in others the worst.

if, in the different states, the number of supreme magistrates should
be in inverse ratio to the number of [[citizens]], it follows that,
generally, democratic [[government]] suits small states, aristocratic
government those of middle size, and [[monarchy]] [[great]] ones. this rule
is immediately deducible from the [[principle]] laid down. but it is
impossible to count the innumerable circumstances which may furnish
exceptions.




chapter iv

democracy


he who makes the [[law]] knows [[know]] [[better]] than any one else how it should be
executed and interpreted. it seems then impossible to have a better
constitution than that in which the executive and legislative powers
are [[united]]; but this very [[fact]] renders the [[government]] in certain
respects inadequate, because things which should be distinguished are
confounded, and the [[prince]] and the [[sovereign]], being the same [[person]],
form, so to speak, no more than a [[government]] without [[government]].

it is not [[good]] for him who makes the laws [[law]] to execute them, or for the
body of the [[people]] to turn its attention away from a general standpoint
and devote it to particular objects. nothing is more dangerous than
the influence of private interests in [[public]] affairs, and the [[abuse]] of
the laws [[law]] by the [[government]] is a less [[evil]] than the [[corruption]] of the
legislator, which is the inevitable sequel to a particular standpoint.
in such a case, the [[state]] being altered in substance, all reformation
becomes impossible. a [[people]] that would never misuse governmental
powers would never misuse independence; a [[people]] that would always
govern well would not need to be governed.

if we take the term in the strict sense, there never has been a real
democracy, and there never will be. it is against the [[natural]] order for
the many to govern and the few to be governed. it is unimaginable that
the [[people]] should remain continually assembled to devote their [[time]] to
public affairs, and it is clear that they cannot set up commissions for
that [[purpose]] without the form of administration being changed.

in [[fact]], i can confidently lay down as a [[principle]] that, when the
functions of [[government]] are shared by several tribunals, the less
numerous sooner or later acquire the [[greatest]] [[authority]], if only
because they are in a position to expedite affairs, and [[power]] thus
naturally comes into their hands.

besides, how many conditions that are difficult to unite does such a
government presuppose! first, a very small [[state]], where the [[people]] can
readily be got together and where each citizen can with ease [[know]] all
the rest; secondly, [[great]] simplicity of manners, to prevent business
from multiplying and raising thorny problems; next, a large measure
of equality in rank and [[fortune]], without which equality of rights [[right]] and
authority cannot long subsist; lastly, little or no luxury--for luxury
either comes of riches [[rich]] or makes them necessary; it corrupts at once
rich and [[poor]], the [[rich]] by possession and the [[poor]] by covetousness; it
sells the [[country]] to softness and vanity, and takes away from the state
all its [[citizens]], to make them slaves [[slave]] one to another, and one and all
to [[public]] [[opinion]].

this is why a famous writer has made [[virtue]] the fundamental principle
of republics [[republic]]; for all these conditions could not [[exist]] without [[virtue]].
but, for want of the necessary distinctions, that [[great]] thinker was
often inexact, and sometimes obscure, and did not see that, the
sovereign [[authority]] being everywhere the same, the same principle
should be found in every well-constituted [[state]], in a greater or less
degree, it is true, according to the form of the [[government]].

it may be added that there is no [[government]] so [[subject]] to civil wars
and intestine agitations as democratic or popular [[government]], because
there is none which has so [[strong]] and continual a tendency to change
to another form, or which demands more vigilance and [[courage]] for its
maintenance as it is. under such a [[constitution]] above all, the citizen
should arm himself with [[strength]] and constancy, and say, every day of
his [[life]], what a [[virtuous]] count palatine[1] said in the diet of poland:
malo periculosam libertatem quam quietum servitium.

were there a [[people]] of gods, their [[government]] would be democratic. so
perfect a [[government]] is not for [[men]].

chapter v

aristocracy


we have here two quite distinct [[moral]] persons [[person]], the [[government]] and
the [[sovereign]], and in consequence two general wills, one general in
relation to all the [[citizens]], the other only for the members of the
administration. thus, although the [[government]] may regulate its internal
policy as it pleases, it can never speak to the [[people]] save in the
name of the [[sovereign]], that is, of the [[people]] itself, a [[fact]] which must
not be forgotten.

the first societies [[society]] governed themselves aristocratically. the heads
of families [[family]] took counsel together on [[public]] affairs. the [[young]] bowed
without [[question]] to the [[authority]] of [[experience]]. hence such names
as _priests, elders, senate_, and _gerontes_. the savages of north
america govern themselves in this way even now, and their [[government]] is
admirable.

but, in proportion as artificial inequality produced by institutions
became predominant over [[natural]] inequality, riches [[rich]] or power[1] were put
before [[age]], and [[aristocracy]] became elective. finally, the transmission
of the father's [[power]] along with his goods [[good]] to his [[children]], by creating
patrician families [[family]], made [[government]] hereditary, and there came to be
senators of twenty.

there are then three sorts of aristocracy--natural, elective and
hereditary. the first is only for simple peoples [[people]]; the third is the
worst of all governments [[government]]; the second is the [[best]], and is aristocracy
properly so called.

besides the advantage that lies [[lie]] in the distinction between the two
powers, it presents [[present]] that of its members being chosen; for, in popular
government, all the [[citizens]] are born magistrates; but here magistracy
is confined to a few, who become such only by election.[2] by this
means uprightness, understanding, [[experience]] and all other claims to
pre-eminence and [[public]] esteem become so many further guarantees of
wise [[government]].

moreover, assemblies are more easily held, affairs [[better]] discussed and
carried out with more order and diligence, and the credit of the state
is [[better]] sustained abroad by venerable senators than by a multitude
that is unknown or despised.

in a word, it is the [[best]] and most [[natural]] arrangement that the wisest
should govern the many, when it is assured that they will govern
for its [[profit]], and not for their own. there is no need to multiply
instruments, or get twenty thousand [[men]] to do what a hundred picked men
can do even [[better]], but it must not be forgotten mat corporate interest
here begins to direct the [[public]] [[power]] less under the regulation of the
general will, and that a further inevitable propensity takes away from
the laws [[law]] part of the executive [[power]].

if we are to speak of what is individually desirable, neither should
the [[state]] be so small, nor a [[people]] so simple and upright, that the
execution of the laws [[law]] follows immediately from the [[public]] will, as
it does in a [[good]] [[democracy]]. nor should the nation be so [[great]] that
the rulers have to scatter in order to govern it and are able to play
the [[sovereign]] each in his own department, and, beginning by making
themselves independent, end by becoming masters.

but if [[aristocracy]] does not demand all the virtues [[virtue]] needed by popular
government, it demands others which are peculiar to itself; for
instance, moderation on the side of the [[rich]] and contentment on that
of the [[poor]]; for it seems that thorough-going equality would be out of
place, as it was not found even at sparta.

furthermore, if this form of [[government]] carries with it a certain
inequality of [[fortune]], this is justifiable in order that as a [[rule]] the
administration of [[public]] affairs may be entrusted to those who are most
able to give them their whole [[time]], but not, as [[aristotle]] maintains, in
order that the [[rich]] may always be put first. on the contrary, it is of
importance that an opposite [[choice]] should occasionally [[teach]] the people
that the deserts of [[men]] offer claims to pre-eminence more important
than those of riches [[rich]].


[1] it is clear that the word _optimates_ meant, among the ancients,
not the [[best]], but the most powerful.

[2] it is of [[great]] importance that the form of the election of
magistrates should be regulated by [[law]]; for if it is left at the
discretion of the [[prince]], it is impossible to avoid falling into
hereditary [[aristocracy]], as the republics [[republic]] of venice and berne actually
did. the first of these has therefore long been a [[state]] dissolved; the
second, however, is maintained by the extreme [[wisdom]] of the senate, and
forms an honourable and highly dangerous exception.




chapter vi

monarchy


so far, we have considered the [[prince]] as a [[moral]] and collective [[person]],
unified by the [[force]] of the laws [[law]], and the depositary in the [[state]] of
the executive [[power]]. we have now to consider this [[power]] when it is
gathered together into the hands of a [[natural]] [[person]], a real [[man]], who
alone has the [[right]] to dispose of it in accordance with the laws [[law]]. such
a [[person]] is called a monarch or [[king]].

in contrast with other forms of administration, in which a collective
being stands for an [[individual]], in this form an [[individual]] stands for a
collective being; so that the [[moral]] unity that constituted the prince
is at the same [[time]] a physical unity, and all the qualities, which in
the other case are only with difficulty brought together by the [[law]],
are found naturally [[united]].

thus the will of the [[people]], the will of the [[prince]], the [[public]] force
of the [[state]], and the particular [[force]] of the [[government]], all [[answer]] to
a [[single]] motive [[power]]; all the springs of the machine are in the same
hands, the whole moves towards the same end; there are no conflicting
movements to cancel one another, and no [[kind]] of [[constitution]] can be
imagined in which a less amount of effort produces [[produce]] a more considerable
amount of action. archimedes, seated quietly on the bank and easily
drawing a [[great]] vessel afloat, stands to my [[mind]] for a skilful monarch,
governing vast states from his study, and moving everything while he
seems himself unmoved.

but if no [[government]] is more vigorous than this, there is also none
in which the particular will holds more sway and rules [[rule]] the rest more
easily. everything moves towards the same end indeed, but this end is
by no means that of the [[public]] [[happiness]], and even the [[force]] of the
administration constantly shows itself prejudicial to the [[state]].

kings [[desire]] to be absolute, and [[men]] are always crying out to them
from afar that the [[best]] means of being so is to get themselves loved
by their [[people]]. this precept is all very well, and even in some
respects very true. unfortunately, it will always be derided at court.
the [[power]] which comes of a people's [[love]] is no [[doubt]] the [[greatest]]; but
it is precarious and conditional, and princes [[prince]] will never rest content
with it. the [[best]] kings [[king]] [[desire]] to be in a position to be wicked, if
they please, without forfeiting their mastery: [[political]] sermonisers
may tell them to their hearts' content that, the people's strength
being their own, their first interest is that the [[people]] should be
prosperous, numerous and formidable; they are well aware that this
is untrue. their first personal interest is that the [[people]] should
be [[weak]], wretched, and unable to resist them. i admit that, provided
the subjects [[subject]] remained always in submission, the prince's interest
would indeed be that it should be powerful, in order that its [[power]],
being his own, might make him formidable to his neighbours; but, this
interest being merely secondary and subordinate, and [[strength]] being
incompatible with submission, princes [[prince]] naturally give the preference
always to the [[principle]] that is more to their immediate advantage. this
is what samuel put strongly before the hebrews, and what macchiavelli
has clearly shown. he professed to [[teach]] kings [[king]]; but it was the people
he really taught. his _prince_ is the [[book]] of republicans.[1]

we found, on general grounds, that [[monarchy]] is suitable only for
great states, and this is confirmed when we examine it in itself.
the more numerous the [[public]] administration, the smaller becomes the
relation between the [[prince]] and the subjects [[subject]], and the nearer it comes
to equality, so that in [[democracy]] the ratio is unity, or absolute
equality. again, as the [[government]] is restricted in numbers the ratio
increases and reaches its _maximum_ when the [[government]] is in the hands
of a [[single]] [[person]]. there is then too [[great]] a distance between prince
and [[people]] and the [[state]] lacks a bond of union. to form such a bond,
there must be intermediate orders, and princes [[prince]], personages and nobility
to compose them. but no such things suit a small [[state]], to which all
class differences mean ruin.

if, however, it is hard for a [[great]] [[state]] to be well governed, it is
much harder for it to be so by a [[single]] [[man]]; and every one knows [[know]] what
happens when kings [[king]] substitute others for themselves.

an essential and inevitable defect, which will always rank monarchical
below republican [[government]], is that in a [[republic]] the [[public]] voice
hardly ever raises to the highest positions [[men]] who are not enlightened
and capable, and such as to fill them with [[honour]]; while in monarchies
these who rise to the top are most often merely petty blunderers petty
swindlers, and petty intriguers, whose petty [[talents]] cause them to
get into the highest positions at court, but, as soon as they have
got there, serve only to make their ineptitude clear to the [[public]].
the [[people]] is far less often mistaken in its [[choice]] than the [[prince]];
and a [[man]] of real worth among the king's ministers is almost as rare
as a [[fool]] at the head of a republican [[government]]. thus, when, by
some fortunate [[chance]], one of these born governors takes the helm of
state in some [[monarchy]] that has been nearly overwhelmed by swarms of
'gentlemanly' administrators, there is nothing but amazement at the
resources he discovers, and his coming marks an era in his country's
history.

for a monarchical [[state]] to have a [[chance]] of being well governed, its
population and extent must be proportionate to the abilities of its
governor. if is easier to conquer than to [[rule]]. with a long enough
lever, the [[world]] could be moved with a [[single]] finger; to sustain it
needs the shoulders of hercules. however small a [[state]] may be, the
prince is hardly ever big enough for it. when, on the other hand,
it happens that the [[state]] is too small for its ruler, in these rare
cases too it is ill governed, because the ruler, constantly pursuing
his [[great]] designs, forgets the interests of the [[people]], and makes
it no less wretched by misusing the [[talents]] he has, than a ruler of
less capacity would make it for want of those he had not. a kingdom
should, so to speak, expand or contract with each reign, according to
the prince's capabilities; but, the abilities of a senate being more
constant in quantity, the [[state]] can then have permanent frontiers
without the administration suffering.

the disadvantage that is most [[felt]] in monarchical [[government]] is the
want of the continuous succession which, in both the other forms,
provides an unbroken bond of union. when one [[king]] dies, another is
needed; elections leave dangerous intervals and are full of storms; and
unless the [[citizens]] are disinterested and upright to a [[degree]] which
very seldom goes with this [[kind]] of [[government]], intrigue and corruption
abound. he to whom the [[state]] has sold itself can hardly [[help]] selling
it in his turn and repaying himself, at the expense of the [[weak]], the
money the powerful have wrung from him. under such an administration,
venality sooner or later spreads through every part, and [[peace]] so
enjoyed under a [[king]] is worse than the disorders of an interregnum.

what has been done to prevent these evils [[evil]]? crowns [[crown]] have been made
hereditary in [[certain]] families [[family]], and an order of succession has been
set up, to prevent disputes from arising on the [[death]] of kings [[king]]. that
is to say, the disadvantages of regency have been put in place of
those of election, apparent tranquillity has been preferred to wise
administration, and [[men]] have chosen rather to risk having [[children]],
monstrosities, or imbeciles as rulers to having disputes over the
choice of [[good]] kings [[king]]. it has not been taken into account that, in
so exposing ourselves to the risks this possibility entails, we are
setting almost all the chances [[chance]] against us. there was sound sense in
what the younger dionysius said to his [[father]], who reproached him for
doing some shameful deed by asking, "did i set you the [[example]]?" "no,"
answered his [[son]], "but your [[father]] was not [[king]]."

everything conspires to take away from a [[man]] who is set in authority
over others the sense of [[justice]] and [[reason]]. much trouble, we are
told, is taken to [[teach]] [[young]] princes [[prince]] the art [[arts]] of reigning; but their
education seems to do them no [[good]]. it would be [[better]] to begin by
teaching them the art [[arts]] of obeying. the [[greatest]] kings [[king]] whose praises
history tells were not brought up to reign: reigning is a [[science]] we
are never so far from possessing as when we have learnt too much of
it, and one we acquire [[better]] by obeying than by commanding. "nam
utilissimus idem ac brevissimus bonarum malarumque rerum delectus
cogitare quid aut nolueris sub alio principe, aut volueris."[2]

one result of this lack of coherence is the inconstancy of royal
government, which, regulated now on one scheme and now on another,
according to the [[character]] of the reigning [[prince]] or those who
reign for him, cannot for long have a fixed object or a consistent
policy--and this variability, not found in the other forms of
government, where the [[prince]] is always the same, causes the [[state]] to
be always shifting from [[principle]] to [[principle]] and from project to
project. thus we may say that generally, if a court is more subtle
in intrigue, there is more [[wisdom]] in a senate, and republics [[republic]] advance
towards their ends by more consistent and [[better]] considered policies;
while every [[revolution]] in a [[royal]] ministry creates a [[revolution]] in
the [[state]]; for the [[principle]] [[common]] to all ministers and nearly all
kings is to do in every [[respect]] the reverse of what was done by their
predecessors.

this incoherence further clears up a sophism that is very familiar to
royalist [[political]] writers; not only is civil [[government]] likened to
domestic [[government]], and the [[prince]] to the [[father]] of a family--this
error has already been refuted--but the [[prince]] is also freely credited
with all the virtues [[virtue]] he ought to possess, and is supposed to be always
what he should be. this supposition once made, [[royal]] [[government]] is
clearly preferable to all others, because it is incontestably the
strongest, and, to be the [[best]] also, wants only a corporate will more
in conformity with the general will.

but if, according to [[plato]],[3] the "king by nature" is such a rarity,
how often will [[nature]] and [[fortune]] conspire to give him a [[crown]]? and, if
royal [[education]] necessarily corrupts those who receive it, what is to
be hoped from a series of [[men]] brought up to reign? it is, then, wanton
self-deception to confuse [[royal]] [[government]] with [[government]] by a good
king. to see such [[government]] as it is in itself, we must consider it as
it is under princes [[prince]] who are incompetent or wicked: for either they will
come to the [[throne]] wicked or incompetent, or the [[throne]] will make them
so.

these difficulties have not escaped our writers, who, all the same,
are not troubled by them. the remedy, they say, is to obey without a
murmur: [[god]] sends [[bad]] kings [[king]] in his wrath, and they must be borne as
the scourges of [[heaven]]. such talk is doubtless edifying; but it would
be more in place in a pulpit than in a [[political]] [[book]]. what are we to
think of a doctor who promises [[miracles]], and whose whole art [[arts]] is to
exhort the sufferer to patience? we [[know]] for ourselves that we must put
up with a [[bad]] [[government]] when it is there; the [[question]] is how to find
a [[good]] one.


[1] macchiavelli was a proper [[man]] and a [[good]] citizen; but, being
attached to the court of the medici, he could not [[help]] veiling his love
of [[liberty]] in the midst of his country's oppression. the [[choice]] of his
detestable hero, cæsar borgia, clearly enough shows his hidden aim;
and the contradiction between the teaching of the _prince_ and that of
the _discourses on livy_ and the _history of florence_ shows that this
profound [[political]] thinker has so far been [[studied]] only by superficial
or [[corrupt]] readers. the court of [[rome]] sternly prohibited his [[book]]. i
can well [[believe]] it; for it is that court it most clearly portrays.


[2] tacitus, _histories_, i. 16. "for the [[best]], and also the shortest
way of finding out what is [[good]] and what is [[bad]] is to consider what you
would have wished to happen or not to happen, had another than you been
emperor."

[3] in the _politicus_.




chapter vii

mixed governments


strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a simple [[government]]. an
isolated ruler must have subordinate magistrates; a popular government
must have a head. there is therefore, in the distribution of the
executive [[power]], always a gradation from the greater to the lesser
number, with the difference that sometimes the greater number is
dependent on the smaller, and sometimes the smaller on the greater.

sometimes the distribution is [[equal]], when either the constituent parts
are in mutual dependence, as in the [[government]] of [[england]], or the
authority of each section is independent, but imperfect, as in poland.
this [[last]] form is [[bad]]; for it secures no unity in the [[government]], and
the [[state]] is left without a bond of union.

is a simple or a mixed [[government]] the [[better]]? [[political]] writers are
always debating the [[question]], which must be answered as we have already
answered a [[question]] about all forms of [[government]].

simple [[government]] is [[better]] in itself, just because it is simple.
but when the executive [[power]] is not sufficiently dependent upon the
legislative [[power]], _i.e._ when the [[prince]] is more closely related to
the [[sovereign]] than the [[people]] to the [[prince]], this lack of proportion
must be cured by the division of the [[government]]; for all the parts have
then no less [[authority]] over the subjects [[subject]], while their division makes
them all together less [[strong]] against the [[sovereign]].

the same disadvantage is also prevented by the appointment of
intermediate magistrates, who leave the [[government]] entire, and have
the effect only of balancing the two powers [[power]] and maintaining their
respective rights [[right]]. [[government]] is then not mixed, but moderated.

the opposite disadvantages may be similarly cured, and, when the
government is too lax, tribunals may be set up to concentrate it.
this is done in all democracies [[democracy]]. in the first case, the [[government]] is
divided to make it [[weak]]; in the second, to make it [[strong]]: for the
_maxima_ of both [[strength]] and weakness are found in simple governments [[government]],
while the mixed forms result in a mean [[strength]].




chapter viii

that all forms of [[government]] do not suit all countries


liberty not being a fruit of all climates, is not within the reach of
all peoples [[people]]. the more this [[principle]], laid down by montesquieu, is
considered, the more its [[truth]] is [[felt]]; the more it is combated, the
more [[chance]] is given to confirm it by new proofs.

in all the governments [[government]] that there are, the [[public]] [[person]] consumes
without producing. whence then does it get what it consumes? from the
labour of its members. the necessities of the [[public]] are supplied out
of the superfluities of individuals [[individual]]. it follows that the civil state
can subsist only so long as men's [[labour]] brings them a return greater
than their needs.

the amount of this excess is not the same in all countries [[country]]. in some
it is considerable, in others middling, in yet others nil, in some
even negative. the relation of product to subsistence depends on the
fertility of the [[climate]], on the sort of [[labour]] the [[land]] demands, on
the [[nature]] of its products, on the [[strength]] of its inhabitants, on the
greater or less consumption they find necessary, and on several further
considerations of which the whole relation is made up.

on the other side, all governments [[government]] are not of the same [[nature]]: some are
less voracious than others, and the differences between them are based
on this second [[principle]], that the further from their source the public
contributions are removed, the more burdensome they become.

the charge should be measured not by the amount of the impositions, but
by the path they have to travel in order to get back to those from whom
they came. when the circulation is prompt and well-established, it does
not matter whether much or little is paid; the [[people]] is always rich
and, financially speaking, all is well. on the contrary, however little
the [[people]] gives, if that little does not return to it, it is soon
exhausted by giving continually: the [[state]] is then never [[rich]], and the
people is always a [[people]] of beggars.

it follows that, the more the distance between [[people]] and government
increases, the more burdensome tribute becomes: thus, in a [[democracy]],
the [[people]] bears the least charge; in an [[aristocracy]], a greater charge;
and, in [[monarchy]], the weight becomes heaviest. [[monarchy]] therefore suits
only wealthy nations; [[aristocracy]], states of middling size and [[wealth]];
and [[democracy]], states that are small and [[poor]].

in [[fact]], the more we reflect, the more we find the difference between
free and monarchical states to be this: in the former, everything is
used for the [[public]] advantage; in the latter, the [[public]] forces [[force]] and
those of individuals [[individual]] are affected by each other, and either increases
as the other grows [[weak]]; finally, instead of governing subjects [[subject]] to make
them [[happy]], despotism makes them wretched in order to govern them.

we find then, in every [[climate]], [[natural]] causes according to which the
form of [[government]] which it requires can be assigned, and we can even
say what sort of inhabitants it should have.

unfriendly and barren lands [[land]], where the product does; not repay the
labour, should remain desert and uncultivated, or peopled only by
savages; lands [[land]] where men's [[labour]] brings in no more than the exact
_minimum_ necessary to subsistence should be inhabited by barbarous
peoples: in such places all polity is impossible. lands [[land]] where the
surplus of product over [[labour]] is only middling are suitable for free
peoples; those in which the soil is abundant and fertile and gives a
great product for a little [[labour]] call for monarchical [[government]],
in order that the surplus of superfluities among the subjects [[subject]] may be
consumed by the luxury of the [[prince]]: for it is [[better]] for this excess
to be absorbed by the [[government]] than dissipated among the individuals [[individual]].
i am aware that there are exceptions; but these exceptions themselves
confirm the [[rule]], in that sooner or later they [[produce]] revolutions
which restore things to the [[natural]] order.

general laws [[law]] should always be distinguished from [[individual]] causes that
may modify their effects. if all the south were covered with republics
and all the north with despotic states, it would be none the less true
that, in point of [[climate]], despotism is suitable to hot countries [[country]],
barbarism to cold countries [[country]], and [[good]] polity to temperate regions. i
see also that, the [[principle]] being granted, there may be disputes on
its application; it may be said that there are cold countries [[country]] that are
very fertile, and tropical countries [[country]] that are very unproductive. but
this difficulty exists only for those who do not consider the question
in all its aspects. we must, as i have already said, take [[labour]],
strength, consumption, etc., into account.

take two tracts of [[equal]] extent, one of which brings in five and the
other ten. if the inhabitants of the first consume four and those of
the second nine, the surplus of the first product will be a fifth and
that of the second a tenth. the ratio of these two surpluses will then
be inverse to that of the products, and the tract which produces [[produce]] only
five will give a surplus double that of the tract which produces [[produce]] ten.

but there is no [[question]] of a double product, and i [[think]] no one would
put the fertility of cold countries [[country]], as a general [[rule]], on an equality
with that of hot ones. let us, however, suppose this equality to [[exist]]:
let us, if you will, regard [[england]] as on the same level as sicily, and
poland as egypt--further south, we shall have [[africa]] and the indies;
further north, nothing at all. to get this equality of product, what
a difference there must be in tillage: in sicily, there is only need
to scratch the ground; in [[england]], how [[men]] must toil! but, where
more hands are needed to get the same product, the superfluity must
necessarily be less.

consider, besides, that the same number of [[men]] consume much less in
hot countries [[country]]. the [[climate]] requires sobriety for the sake of health;
and europeans [[european]] who try to [[live]] there as they would at [[home]] all perish
of dysentery and indigestion. "we are," says chardin, "carnivorous
animals, wolves, in comparison with the asiatics. some attribute
the sobriety of the persians to the [[fact]] that their [[country]] is less
cultivated; but it is my [[belief]] that their [[country]] abounds less in
commodities because the inhabitants need less. if their frugality," he
goes on, "were the effect of the nakedness of the [[land]], only the poor
would [[eat]] little; but everybody does so. again, less or more would be
eaten in various provinces, according to the land's fertility; but the
same sobriety is found throughout the [[kingdom]]. they are very proud of
their manner of [[life]], saying that you have only to look at their hue
to recognise how far it excels that of the christians [[christian]]. in [[fact]], the
persians are of an even hue; their skins are [[fair]], fine and smooth;
while the hue of their subjects [[subject]], the armenians, who [[live]] after the
european [[fashion]], is rough and blotchy, and their bodies [[body]] are gross and
unwieldy."

the nearer you get to the equator, the less [[people]] [[live]] on. meat
they hardly touch; rice, maize, curcur, millet and cassava are
their ordinary food. there are in the indies millions of [[men]] whose
subsistence does not cost a halfpenny a day. even in [[europe]] we find
considerable differences of appetite between northern and southern
peoples. a spaniard will [[live]] for a week on a german's dinner. in the
countries in which [[men]] are more voracious, luxury therefore turns
in the direction of consumption. in [[england]], luxury appears in a
well-filled table; in [[italy]], you feast on sugar and flowers.

luxury in clothes shows similar differences. in climates in which the
changes of season are prompt and [[violent]], [[men]] have [[better]] and simpler
clothes; where they clothe themselves only for adornment, what is
striking is more [[thought]] of than what is useful; clothes themselves are
then a luxury. at naples, you may see daily walking in the pausilippeum
men in gold-embroidered upper garments and nothing else. it is the same
with buildings; magnificence is the sole consideration where there is
nothing to [[fear]] from the air. in [[paris]] and [[london]], you [[desire]] to be
lodged warmly and comfortably; in madrid, you have superb salons, but
not a window that closes, and you go to bed in a mere hole.

in hot countries [[country]] foods are much more substantial and succulent; and
the third difference cannot but have an influence on the second. why
are so many vegetables eaten in [[italy]]? because there they are [[good]],
nutritious and excellent in taste. in [[france]], where they are nourished
only on water, they are far from nutritious and are [[thought]] nothing of
at table. they take up all the same no less ground, and cost at least
as much pains [[pain]] to cultivate. it is a proved [[fact]] that the wheat of
barbary, in other respects [[respect]] inferior to that of [[france]], yields much more
flour, and that the wheat of [[france]] in turn yields more than that of
northern countries [[country]]; from which it may be inferred that a like gradation
in the same direction, from equator to pole, is found generally. but
is it not an obvious disadvantage for an [[equal]] product to contain less
nourishment?

to all these points may be added another, which at once depends on
and strengthens them. hot countries [[country]] need inhabitants less than cold
countries, and can support more of them. there is thus a double
surplus, which is all to the advantage of despotism. the greater the
territory occupied by a fixed number of inhabitants, the more difficult
revolt becomes, because rapid or secret concerted action is impossible,
and the [[government]] can easily unmask projects and cut communications;
but the more a numerous [[people]] is gathered together, the less can
the [[government]] usurp the sovereign's place: the people's leaders can
deliberate as safely in their houses as the [[prince]] in council, and
the crowd gathers as rapidly in the squares as the prince's [[troops]] in
their quarters. the advantage of [[tyrannical]] [[government]] therefore lies
in acting at [[great]] distances. with the [[help]] of the rallying-points
it establishes, its [[strength]], like that of the lever,[1] grows with
distance. the [[strength]] of the [[people]], on the other hand, acts only when
concentrated: when spread abroad, it evaporates and is lost, like
powder scattered on the ground, which catches [[fire]] only grain by grain.
the least populous countries [[country]] are thus the fittest for [[tyranny]]: fierce
animals reign only in deserts.


[1] this does not contradict what i said before (book ii, ch. ix) about
the disadvantages of [[great]] states; for we were then dealing with the
authority of the [[government]] over the members, while here we are dealing
with its [[force]] against the subjects [[subject]]. its scattered members serve it as
rallying-points for action against the [[people]] at a distance, but it has
no rallying-point for direct action on its members themselves. thus the
length of the lever is its weakness in the one case, and its strength
in the other.




chapter ix

the marks of a [[good]] government


the [[question]] "what absolutely is the [[best]] [[government]]?" is unanswerable
as well as indeterminate; or rather, there are as many [[good]] answers [[answer]] as
there are possible combinations in the absolute and relative situations
of all nations.

but if it is [[asked]] by what sign we may [[know]] that a given [[people]] is well
or ill governed, that is another matter, and the [[question]], being one of
fact, admits of an [[answer]].

it is not, however, answered, because every-one wants to [[answer]] it in
his own way. subjects [[subject]] extol [[public]] tranquillity, [[citizens]] individual
liberty; the one class prefers security of possessions, the other that
of [[person]]; the one regards as the [[best]] [[government]] that which is most
severe, the other maintains that the mildest is the [[best]]; the one wants
crimes punished, the other wants them prevented; the one wants the
state to be feared by its neighbours, the other prefers that it should
be ignored; the one is content if [[money]] circulates, the other demands
that the [[people]] shall have bread. even if an agreement were come to
on these and similar points, should we have got any further? as moral
qualities do not admit of exact measurement, agreement about the mark
does not mean agreement about the valuation.

for my part, i am continually astonished that a mark so simple is not
recognised, or that [[men]] are of so [[bad]] [[faith]] as not to admit it. what
is the end of [[political]] association? the preservation and prosperity
of its members. and what is the surest mark of their preservation and
prosperity? their numbers and [[population]]. seek then nowhere else this
mark that is in dispute. the rest being [[equal]], the [[government]] under
which, without external aids, without naturalisation or colonies, the
citizens increase and multiply most, is beyond [[question]] the [[best]].
the [[government]] under which a [[people]] wanes and diminishes is worst.
calculators, it is left for you to count, to measure, to compare.[1]


[1] on the same [[principle]] it should be judged what centuries deserve
the preference for [[human]] [[prosperity]]. those in which letters and arts
have flourished have been too much admired, because the hidden object
of their [[culture]] has not been fathomed, and their fatal effects not
taken into account. "idque apud imperitos humanitas vocabatur, cum
pars servitutis esset." ["fools called 'humanity' what was a part of
slavery," tacitus, _agricola_, 31.] shall we never see in the maxims
books lay down the vulgar interest that makes their writers speak?
no, whatever they may say, when, despite its renown, a [[country]] is
depopulated, it is not true that all is well, and it is not enough that
a poet should have an income of 100,000 francs to make his [[age]] the
best of all. less attention should be paid to the apparent repose and
tranquillity of the rulers than to the well-being of their nations as
wholes, and above all of the most numerous states. a hail-storm lays
several cantons waste, but it rarely makes a famine. outbreaks and
civil wars [[war]] give rulers rude shocks, but they are not the real ills of
peoples, who may even get a respite, while there is a dispute as to who
shall tyrannise over them. their true [[prosperity]] and calamities come
from their permanent condition: it is when the whole remains crushed
beneath the yoke, that decay sets in, and that the rulers destroy
them at will, and "ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant" ["where
they create solitude, they call it [[peace]]," tacitus, _agricola_, 31.]
when the bickerings of the [[great]] disturbed the [[kingdom]] of [[france]], and
the coadjutor of [[paris]] took a dagger in his pocket to the [[parliament]],
these things did not prevent the [[people]] of [[france]] from prospering and
multiplying in [[dignity]], ease and [[freedom]]. long ago greece flourished
in the midst of the most savage wars [[war]]; [[blood]] ran in torrents, and yet
the whole [[country]] was covered with inhabitants. it appeared, says
macchiavelli, that in the midst of murder, proscription and civil [[war]],
our [[republic]] only throve: the [[virtue]], morality and independence of the
citizens did more to strengthen it than all their dissensions had done
to enfeeble it a little disturbance gives the [[soul]] elasticity; what
makes the [[race]] truly prosperous is not so much [[peace]] as [[liberty]].




chapter x

the [[abuse]] of [[government]] and its tendency to degenerate


as the particular will acts constantly in opposition to the general
will, the [[government]] continually exerts itself against the sovereignty.
the greater this exertion becomes, the more the [[constitution]] changes [[change]];
and, as there is in this case no other corporate will to create an
equilibrium by resisting the will of the [[prince]], sooner or later the
prince must inevitably suppress the [[sovereign]] and break the social
treaty. this is the unavoidable and inherent defect which, from the
very birth of the [[body]] [[politic]], tends ceaselessly to [[destroy]] it, as age
and [[death]] end by destroying the [[human]] [[body]].

there are two general courses by which [[government]] degenerates: _i.e._
when it undergoes contraction, or when the [[state]] is dissolved.

government undergoes contraction when it passes from the many to the
few, that is, from [[democracy]] to [[aristocracy]], and from [[aristocracy]] to
royalty. to do so is its [[natural]] propensity.[1] if it took the backward
course from the few to the many, it could be said that it was relaxed;
by this inverse sequence is impossible.

indeed, governments [[government]] never [[change]] their form except when their energy
is exhausted and leaves them too [[weak]] to keep what they have. if a
government at once extended its sphere and relaxed its stringency, its
force would become absolutely nil, and it would persist still less. it
is therefore necessary to wind up the spring and tighten the hold as it
gives way: or else the [[state]] it sustains will come to [[grief]].

the dissolution of the [[state]] may come about in either of two ways.

first, when the [[prince]] ceases to administer the [[state]] in accordance
with the laws [[law]], and usurps the [[sovereign]] [[power]]. a remarkable [[change]] then
occurs: not the [[government]], but the [[state]], undergoes contraction; i
mean that the [[great]] [[state]] is dissolved, and another is formed within
it, composed solely of the members of the [[government]], which becomes for
the rest of the [[people]] merely master and [[tyrant]]. so that the moment the
government usurps the sovereignty, the social compact is broken and
all private [[citizens]] recover by [[right]] their [[natural]] [[liberty]], and are
forced, but not bound, to obey.

the same thing happens when the members of the [[government]] severally
usurp the [[power]] they should exercise only as a [[body]]; this is as great
an infraction of the laws [[law]], and results in even greater disorders. there
are then, so to speak, as many princes [[prince]] as there are magistrates, and
the [[state]], no less divided than the [[government]], either perishes or
changes its form.

when the [[state]] is dissolved, the [[abuse]] of [[government]], whatever it
is, bears the [[common]] name of _anarchy_. to distinguish, democracy
degenerates into _ochlocracy_ and [[aristocracy]] into _oligarchy_ and i
would add that royalty degenerates into _tyranny_; but this [[last]] word
is ambiguous and needs explanation.

in vulgar usage, a [[tyrant]] is a [[king]] who governs violently and without
regard for [[justice]] and [[law]]. in the exact sense, a [[tyrant]] is an
individual who arrogates to himself the [[royal]] [[authority]] without having
a [[right]] to it. this is how the greeks [[greek]] understood the word "tyrant":
they applied it indifferently to [[good]] and [[bad]] princes [[prince]] whose authority
was not legitimate.[2] _tyrant_ and _usurper_ are thus perfectly
synonymous terms.

in order that i may give different things different names, i call
him who usurps the [[royal]] [[authority]] _tyrant_, and him who usurps the
sovereign [[power]] a _despot_. the [[tyrant]] is he who thrusts himself in
contrary to the laws [[law]] to govern in accordance with the laws [[law]]; the despot
is he who sets himself above the laws [[law]] themselves. thus the tyrant
cannot be a despot, but the despot is always a [[tyrant]].


[1] the slow formation and the [[progress]] of the [[republic]] of venice in
its lagoons are a notable instance of this sequence; and it is most
astonishing that, after more than twelve hundred years' existence, the
venetians seem to be still at the second stage, which they reached with
the _serrar di consiglio_ in 1198. as for the ancient dukes who are
brought up against them, it is proved, whatever the _squittinio della
libertà veneta_ may say of them, that they were in no sense sovereigns [[sovereign]].

a case [[certain]] to be cited against my view is that of the roman
republic, which, it will be said, followed exactly the opposite course,
and passed from [[monarchy]] to [[aristocracy]] and from [[aristocracy]] to
democracy. i by no means take this view of it.

what romulus first set up was a mixed [[government]], which soon
deteriorated into despotism. from special causes, the [[state]] died an
untimely [[death]], as new-born [[children]] sometimes perish without reaching
manhood. the expulsion of the tarquins was the real period of the birth
of the [[republic]]. but at first it took on no constant form, because,
by not abolishing the patriciate, it left half its [[work]] undone. for,
by this means, hereditary [[aristocracy]], the worst of all legitimate
forms of administration, remained in conflict with [[democracy]], and the
form of the [[government]], as macchiavelli has proved, was only fixed
on the establishment of the tribunate: only then was there a true
government and a veritable [[democracy]]. in [[fact]], the [[people]] was then not
only [[sovereign]], but also magistrate and [[judge]]; the senate was only a
subordinate tribunal, to temper and concentrate the [[government]], and the
consuls themselves, though they were patricians, first magistrates, and
absolute generals in [[war]], were in [[rome]] itself no more than presidents
of the [[people]].

from that point, the [[government]] followed its [[natural]] tendency,
and inclined strongly to [[aristocracy]]. the patriciate, we may say,
abolished itself, and the [[aristocracy]] was found no longer in the body
of patricians as at venice and genoa, but in the [[body]] of the senate,
which was composed of patricians and plebeians, and even in the body
of tribunes when they began to usurp an active function: for names do
not affect facts [[fact]], and, when the [[people]] has rulers who govern for it,
whatever name they bear, the [[government]] is an [[aristocracy]].

the [[abuse]] of [[aristocracy]] [[led]] to the civil wars [[war]] and the triumvirate.
sulla, julius cæsar and augustus became in [[fact]] real monarchs; and
finally, under the despotism of tiberius, the [[state]] was dissolved.
roman [[history]] then confirms, instead of invalidating, the [[principle]] i
have laid down.

[2] omnes enim et habentur et dicuntur tyranni, qui potestate utuntur
perpetua in ea civitate quæ libertate usa est (cornelius nepos, _life
of miltiades_). [for all those are called and considered tyrants [[tyrant]],
who hold perpetual [[power]] in a [[state]] that has known [[liberty]].] it is
true that [[aristotle]] (_nicomachean ethics_, [[book]] viii, [[chapter]] x)
distinguishes the [[tyrant]] from the [[king]] by the [[fact]] that the former
governs in his own interest, and the latter only for the [[good]] of his
subjects; but not only did all [[greek]] authors in general use the word
_tyrant_ in a different sense, as appears most clearly in xenophon's
_hiero_, but also it would [[follow]] from aristotle's distinction that,
from the very beginning of the [[world]], there has not yet been a single
king.




chapter xi

the [[death]] of the [[body]] politic


such is the [[natural]] and inevitable tendency of the [[best]] constituted
governments. if sparta and [[rome]] perished, what [[state]] can [[hope]] to endure
for ever? if we would set up a long-lived form of [[government]], let us
not even [[dream]] of making it eternal. if we are to succeed, we must not
attempt the impossible, or flatter ourselves that we are endowing the
work of [[man]] with a stability of which [[human]] conditions do not permit.

the [[body]] [[politic]], as well as the [[human]] [[body]], begins to [[die]] as soon as
it is born, and carries in itself the causes of its destruction. but
both may have a [[constitution]] that is more or less robust and suited to
preserve them a longer or a shorter [[time]]. the [[constitution]] of [[man]] is
the [[work]] of [[nature]]; that of the [[state]] the [[work]] of art [[arts]]. it is not in
men's [[power]] to prolong their own lives [[life]]; but it is for them to prolong
as much as possible the [[life]] of the [[state]], by giving it the best
possible [[constitution]]. the [[best]] constituted [[state]] will have an end;
but it will end later than any other, unless some unforeseen accident
brings about its untimely destruction.

the life-principle of the [[body]] [[politic]] lies [[lie]] in the [[sovereign]] [[authority]].
the legislative [[power]] is the [[heart]] of the [[state]]; the executive power
is its brain, which causes the movement of all the parts. the brain
may become paralysed and the [[individual]] still [[live]]. a [[man]] may remain
an imbecile and [[live]]; but as soon as the [[heart]] ceases to perform its
functions, the animal is [[dead]].

the [[state]] subsists by means not of the laws [[law]], but of the legislative
power. yesterday's [[law]] is not binding to-day; but [[silence]] is taken for
tacit [[consent]], and the [[sovereign]] is held to confirm incessantly the
laws it does not abrogate as it might. all that it has once declared
itself to will it wills always, unless it revokes its declaration.

why then is so much [[respect]] paid to old laws [[law]]? for this very [[reason]]. we
must [[believe]] that nothing but the excellence of old acts of will can
have preserved them so long: if the [[sovereign]] had not recognised them
as throughout salutary, it would have revoked them a thousand times [[time]].
this is why, so far from growing [[weak]], the laws [[law]] continually gain new
strength in any well constituted [[state]]; the precedent of antiquity
makes them daily more venerable: while wherever the laws [[law]] grow [[weak]] as
they become old, this proves that there is no longer a legislative
power, and that the [[state]] is [[dead]].




chapter xii

how the [[sovereign]] [[authority]] maintains itself


the [[sovereign]], having no [[force]] other than the legislative [[power]], acts
only by means of the laws [[law]]; and the laws [[law]] being solely the authentic acts
of the general will, the [[sovereign]] cannot act save when the [[people]] is
assembled. the [[people]] in assembly, i shall be told, is a mere chimera.
it is so to-day, but two thousand years ago it was not so. has man's
nature changed?

the bounds of possibility, in [[moral]] matters, are less narrow than
we imagine: it is our weaknesses, our vices [[vice]] and our prejudices that
confine them. base souls [[soul]] have no [[belief]] in [[great]] [[men]]; vile slaves [[slave]] smile
in mockery at the name of [[liberty]].

let us [[judge]] of what can be done by what has been done. i shall say
nothing of the republics [[republic]] of ancient greece; but the roman [[republic]] was,
to my [[mind]], a [[great]] [[state]], and the town of [[rome]] a [[great]] town. the last
census showed that there were in [[rome]] four hundred thousand citizens
capable of bearing arms, and the [[last]] computation of the population
of the [[empire]] showed over four million [[citizens]], excluding subjects [[subject]],
foreigners, [[women]], [[children]] and slaves [[slave]].

what difficulties might not be supposed to stand in the way of the
frequent assemblage of the vast [[population]] of this [[capital]] and its
neighbourhood. yet few weeks passed without the roman [[people]] being in
assembly, and even being so several times [[time]]. it exercised not only the
rights of sovereignty, but also a part of those of [[government]]. it dealt
with [[certain]] matters, and judged [[certain]] cases, and this whole people
was found in the [[public]] meeting-place hardly less often as magistrates
than as [[citizens]].

if we went back to the earliest [[history]] of nations, we should find that
most ancient governments [[government]], even those of monarchical form, such as the
macedonian and the frankish, had similar councils. in any case, the one
incontestable [[fact]] i have given is an [[answer]] to all difficulties; it is
good [[logic]] to [[reason]] from the actual to the possible.




chapter xiii

the same (_continued_)


it is not enough for the assembled [[people]] to have once fixed the
constitution of the [[state]] by giving its sanction to a [[body]] of [[law]];
it is not enough for it to have set up a perpetual [[government]], or
provided once for all for the election of magistrates. besides the
extraordinary assemblies unforeseen circumstances may demand, there
must be fixed periodical assemblies which cannot be abrogated or
prorogued, so that on the proper day the [[people]] is legitimately called
together by [[law]], without need of any formal summoning.

but, apart from these assemblies authorised by their date alone, every
assembly of the [[people]] not summoned by the magistrates appointed for
that [[purpose]], and in accordance with the prescribed forms, should be
regarded as unlawful, and all its acts as null and void, because the
command to assemble should itself proceed from the [[law]].

the greater or less frequency with which lawful assemblies should occur
depends on so many considerations that no exact rules [[rule]] about them can be
given. it can only be said generally that the stronger the government
the more often should the [[sovereign]] show itself.

this, i shall be told, may do for a [[single]] town; but what is to be
done when the [[state]] includes several? is the [[sovereign]] [[authority]] to be
divided? or is it to be concentrated in a [[single]] town to which all the
rest are made [[subject]]?

neither the one nor the other, i reply. first, the [[sovereign]] authority
is one and simple, and cannot be divided without being destroyed. in th
second place, one town cannot, any more than one nation, legitimately
be made [[subject]] to another, because the essence of the [[body]] politic
lies in the reconciliation of [[obedience]] and [[liberty]], and the words
subject and [[sovereign]] are identical correlatives the [[idea]] of which
meets in the [[single]] word "citizen."

i [[answer]] further that the union of several towns in a [[single]] [[city]] is
always [[bad]], and that, if we [[wish]] to make such a union, we should not
expect to avoid its [[natural]] disadvantages. it is useless to bring up
abuses that belong to [[great]] states against one who desires [[desire]] to see only
small ones; but how can small states be given the [[strength]] to resist
great ones, as formerly the [[greek]] towns resisted the [[great]] [[king]], and
more recently holland and switzerland have resisted the house of
austria?

nevertheless, if the [[state]] cannot be reduced to the [[right]] limits, there
remains still one resource; this is, to allow no [[capital]], to make the
seat of [[government]] move from town to town, and to assemble by turn in
each the provincial estates of the [[country]].

people the territory evenly, extend everywhere the same rights [[right]], bear
to every place in it abundance and [[life]]: by these means will the state
become at once as [[strong]] and as well governed as possible. remember
that the walls of towns are built of the ruins of the houses of the
countryside. for every palace i see raised in the [[capital]], my mind's
eye sees a whole [[country]] made desolate.




chapter xiv

the same (continued)


the moment the [[people]] is legitimately assembled as a [[sovereign]] [[body]],
the jurisdiction of the [[government]] wholly lapses, the executive power
is suspended, and the [[person]] of the meanest citizen is as [[sacred]] and
inviolable as that of the first magistrate; for in the presence of
the [[person]] represented, representatives no longer [[exist]]. most of the
tumults that arose in the comitia at [[rome]] were due to ignorance or
neglect of this [[rule]]. the consuls were in them merely the presidents of
the [[people]]; the tribunes were mere speakers;[1] the senate was nothing
at all.

these intervals of suspension, during which the [[prince]] recognises or
ought to recognise an actual superior, have always been viewed by him
with alarm; and these assemblies of the [[people]], which are the aegis
of the [[body]] [[politic]] and the curb on the [[government]], have at all times
been the [[horror]] of rulers: who therefore never spare pains [[pain]], objections,
difficulties, and promises, to stop the [[citizens]] from having them. when
the [[citizens]] are greedy, cowardly, and pusillanimous, and [[love]] ease
more than [[liberty]], they do not long hold out against the redoubled
efforts of the [[government]]; and thus, as the resisting [[force]] incessantly
grows, the [[sovereign]] [[authority]] ends by disappearing, and most cities
fall and perish before their [[time]].

but between the [[sovereign]] [[authority]] and arbitrary [[government]] there
sometimes intervenes a mean [[power]] of which something must be said.


[1] in nearly the same sense as this word has in the english
parliament. the similarity of these functions would have brought the
consuls and the tribunes into conflict, even had all jurisdiction been
suspended.




chapter xv

deputies or representatives


as soon as [[public]] service ceases to be the [[chief]] [[business]] of the
citizens, and they would rather serve with their [[money]] than with their
persons, the [[state]] is not far from its fall. when it is necessary
to march out to [[war]], they [[pay]] [[troops]] and stay at [[home]]: when it is
necessary to meet in council, they name deputies and stay at [[home]]. by
reason of idleness and [[money]], they end by having soldiers to enslave
their [[country]] and representatives to sell it.

it is through the hustle of commerce and the [[arts]], through the greedy
self-interest of [[profit]], and through softness and [[love]] of amenities
that personal services are replaced by [[money]] payments. [[men]] surrender
a part of their profits [[profit]] in order to have [[time]] to increase them at
leisure. make gifts of [[money]], and you will not be long without chains.
the word _finance_ is a slavish word, unknown in the city-state. in a
country that is truly [[free]], the [[citizens]] do everything with their own
arms and nothing by means of [[money]]; so far from paying to be exempted
from their duties [[duty]], they would even [[pay]] for the [[privilege]] of fulfilling
them themselves. i am far from taking the [[common]] view: i hold enforced
labour to be less opposed to [[liberty]] than taxes.

the [[better]] the [[constitution]] of a [[state]] is, the more do [[public]] affairs
encroach on private in the minds [[mind]] of the [[citizens]]. private affairs are
even of much less importance, because the aggregate of the common
happiness furnishes a greater proportion of that of each [[individual]],
so that there is less for him to seek in particular cares [[care]]. in a
well-ordered [[city]] every [[man]] flies to the assemblies: under a bad
government no one cares [[care]] to stir a step to get to them, because no one
is interested in what happens there, because it is foreseen that the
general will will not prevail, and lastly because domestic cares [[care]] are
all-absorbing. [[good]] laws [[law]] lead to the making of [[better]] ones; [[bad]] ones
bring about worse. as soon as any [[man]] says of the affairs of the state
_what does it matter to me?_ the [[state]] may be given up for lost.

the lukewarmness of [[patriotism]], the activity of private interest, the
vastness of states, [[conquest]] and the [[abuse]] of [[government]] suggested
the method of having deputies or representatives of the [[people]] in
the national assemblies. these are what, in some countries [[country]], [[men]] have
presumed to call the third estate. thus the [[individual]] interest of two
orders is put first and second; the [[public]] interest occupies only the
third place.

sovereignty, for the same [[reason]] as makes it inalienable, cannot be
represented; it lies [[lie]] essentially in the general will, and will does not
admit of representation: it is either the same, or other; there is no
intermediate possibility. the deputies of the [[people]], therefore, are
not and cannot be its representatives: they are merely its stewards,
and can carry through no definitive acts. every [[law]] the [[people]] has not
ratified in [[person]] is null and void--is, in [[fact]], not a [[law]]. the people
of [[england]] regards itself as [[free]]; but it is grossly mistaken; it is
free only during the election of members of [[parliament]]. as soon as they
are elected, [[slavery]] overtakes it, and it is nothing. the use it makes
of the short moments of [[liberty]] it enjoys shows indeed that it deserves
to lose them.

the [[idea]] of representation is [[modern]]; it comes to us from feudal
government, from that iniquitous and absurd [[system]] which degrades
humanity and dishonours the name of [[man]]. in ancient republics [[republic]] and even
in monarchies [[monarchy]], the [[people]] never had representatives; the word itself
was unknown. it is very singular that in [[rome]], where the tribunes
were so sacrosanct, it was never even imagined that they could usurp
the functions of the [[people]], and that in the midst of so [[great]] a
multitude they never attempted to pass on their own [[authority]] a single
plebiscitum. we can, however, form an [[idea]] of the difficulties caused
sometimes by the [[people]] being so numerous, from what happened in the
time of the gracchi, when some of the [[citizens]] had to cast their votes
from the roofs of buildings.

where [[right]] and [[liberty]] are everything, disadvantages count for
nothing. among this [[wise]] [[people]] everything was given its just value,
its lictors were allowed to do what its tribunes would never have dared
to attempt; for it had no [[fear]] that its lictors would try to represent
it.

to explain, however, in what way the tribunes did sometimes represent
it, it is enough to conceive how the [[government]] represents the
sovereign. [[law]] being purely the declaration of the general will, it is
clear that, in the exercise of the legislative [[power]], the [[people]] cannot
be represented; but in that of the executive [[power]], which is only the
force that is applied to give the [[law]] effect, it both can and should be
represented. we thus see that if we looked closely into the matter we
should find that very few nations have any laws [[law]]. however that may be,
it is [[certain]] that the tribunes, possessing no executive [[power]], could
never represent the roman [[people]] by [[right]] of the powers [[power]] entrusted to
them, but only by usurping those of the senate.

in greece, all that the [[people]] had to do, it did for itself; it was
constantly assembled in the [[public]] square. the greeks [[greek]] lived in a mild
climate; they had no [[natural]] greed; slaves [[slave]] did their [[work]] for them;
their [[great]] concern was with [[liberty]]. lacking the same advantages, how
can you preserve the same rights [[right]]? your severer climates add to your
needs;[1] for half the year your [[public]] squares are uninhabitable; the
flatness of your languages [[language]] unfits them for being heard in the open air;
you [[sacrifice]] more for [[profit]] than for [[liberty]], and [[fear]] [[slavery]] less
than [[poverty]].

what then? is [[liberty]] maintained only by the [[help]] of [[slavery]]? it may be
so. extremes meet. everything that is not in the course of [[nature]] has
its disadvantages, civil [[society]] most of all. there are some unhappy
circumstances in which we can only keep our [[liberty]] at others' expense,
and where the citizen can be perfectly [[free]] only when the [[slave]] is most
a [[slave]]. such was the case with sparta. as for you, [[modern]] peoples [[people]],
you have no slaves [[slave]], but you are slaves [[slave]] yourselves; you [[pay]] for their
liberty with your own. it is in [[vain]] that you boast of this preference;
i find in it more cowardice than [[humanity]].

i do not mean by all this that it is necessary to have slaves [[slave]], or that
the [[right]] of [[slavery]] is legitimate: i am merely giving the reasons [[reason]] why
modern peoples [[people]], believing themselves to be [[free]], have representatives,
while ancient peoples [[people]] had none. in any case, the moment a [[people]] allows
itself to be represented, it is no longer [[free]]: it no longer exists.

all things considered, i do not see that it is possible henceforth for
the [[sovereign]] to preserve among us the exercise of its rights [[right]], unless
the [[city]] is very small. but if it is very small, it will be conquered?
no. i will show later on how the external [[strength]] of a [[great]] people[2]
may be combined with the convenient polity and [[good]] order of a small
state.


[1] to adopt in cold countries [[country]] the luxury and effeminacy of the east is
to [[desire]] to submit to its chains; it is indeed to bow to them far more
inevitably in our case than in theirs.

[2] i had intended to do this in the sequel to this [[work]], when
in dealing with external relations i came to the [[subject]] of
confederations. the [[subject]] is quite new, and its principles [[principle]] have still
to be laid down.




chapter xvi

that the institution of [[government]] is not a contract


the legislative [[power]] once well established, the next thing is to
establish similarly the executive [[power]]; for this latter, which
operates only by particular acts, not being of the essence of the
former, is naturally separate from it. were it possible for the
sovereign, as such, to possess the executive [[power]], [[right]] and fact
would be so confounded that no one could tell what was [[law]] and what was
not; and the [[body]] [[politic]], thus disfigured, would soon fall a prey to
the [[violence]] it was instituted to prevent.

as the [[citizens]], by the social contract, are all [[equal]], all can
prescribe what all should do, but no one has a [[right]] to demand that
another shall do what he does not do himself. it is strictly this
right, which is indispensable for giving the [[body]] [[politic]] [[life]] and
movement, that the [[sovereign]], in instituting the [[government]], confers
upon the [[prince]].

it has been held that this act of establishment was a contract between
the [[people]] and the rulers it sets over itself.--a contract in which
conditions were laid down between the two parties binding the one to
command and the other to obey. it will be admitted, i am sure, that
this is an odd [[kind]] of contract to enter into. but let us see if this
view can be upheld.

first, the supreme [[authority]] can no more be modified than it can be
alienated; to limit it is to [[destroy]] it. it is absurd and contradictory
for the [[sovereign]] to set a superior over itself; to bind itself to obey
a master would be to return to absolute [[liberty]].

moreover, it is clear that this contract between the [[people]] and such
and such persons [[person]] would be a particular act; and from this it follows
that it can be neither a [[law]] nor an act of sovereignty, and that
consequently it would be illegitimate.

it is plain too that the contracting parties in relation to each other
would be under the [[law]] of [[nature]] alone and wholly without guarantees
of their mutual undertakings, a position wholly at variance with the
civil [[state]]. he who has [[force]] at his command being always in a position
to control execution, it would come to the same thing if the name
"contract" were given to the act of one [[man]] who said to another; "i
give you all my goods [[good]], on condition that you give me back as much of
them as you please."

there is only one contract in the [[state]], and that is the act of
association, which in itself excludes the existence of a second. it
is impossible to conceive of any [[public]] contract that would not be a
violation of the first.




chapter xvii

the institution of government


under what general [[idea]] then should the act by which [[government]] is
instituted be conceived as falling? i will begin by stating that the
act is complex, as being composed of two others--the establishment' of
the [[law]] and its execution.

by the former, the [[sovereign]] decrees that there shall be a governing
body established in this or that form; this act is clearly a [[law]].

by the latter, the [[people]] nominates the rulers who are to be entrusted
with the [[government]] that has been established. this nomination, being a
particular act, is clearly not a second [[law]], but merely a consequence
of the first and a function of [[government]].

the difficulty is to [[understand]] how there can be a governmental act
before [[government]] exists, and how the [[people]], which is only sovereign
or [[subject]], can, under [[certain]] circumstances, become a [[prince]] or
magistrate.

it is at this point that there is revealed one of the astonishing
properties of the [[body]] [[politic]], by means of which it reconciles
apparently contradictory operations; for this is accomplished by a
sudden conversion of sovereignty into [[democracy]], so that, without
sensible [[change]], and merely by [[virtue]] of a new relation of all to all,
the [[citizens]] become magistrates and pass from general to particular
acts, from legislation to the execution of the [[law]].

this changed relation is no speculative subtlety without instances
in practice: it happens every day in the english [[parliament]], where,
on [[certain]] occasions [[occasion]], the lower house resolves itself into grand
committee, for the [[better]] discussion of affairs, and thus, from being
at one moment a [[sovereign]] court, becomes at the next a mere commission;
so that subsequently it reports to itself, as house of commons [[common]], the
result of its proceedings in grand committee, and debates over again
under one name what it has already settled under another.

it is, indeed, the peculiar advantage of democratic [[government]] that it
can be established in actuality by a simple act of the general will.
subsequently, this provisional [[government]] remains in [[power]], if this
form is adopted, or else establishes in the name of the [[sovereign]] the
government that is prescribed by [[law]]; and thus the whole proceeding
is regular. it is impossible to set up [[government]] in any other manner
legitimately and in accordance with the principles [[principle]] so far laid down.




chapter xviii

how to check the usurpations of government


what we have just said confirms [[chapter]] xvi, and makes it clear that
the institution of [[government]] is not a contract, but a [[law]]; that the
depositaries of the executive [[power]] are not the people's masters, but
its officers; that it can set them up and pull them down when it likes;
that for them there is no [[question]] of contract, but of [[obedience]]; and
that in taking charge of the functions the [[state]] imposes on them they
are doing no more than fulfilling their [[duty]] as [[citizens]], without
having the remotest [[right]] to argue about the conditions.

when therefore the [[people]] sets up an hereditary [[government]], whether
it be monarchical and confined to one [[family]], or aristocratic and
confined to a class, what it enters into is not an undertaking; the
administration is given a provisional form, until the [[people]] chooses to
order it otherwise.

it is true that such changes [[change]] are always dangerous, and that the
established [[government]] should never be touched except when it comes
to be incompatible with the [[public]] [[good]]; but the circumspection this
involves is a [[maxim]] of policy and not a [[rule]] of [[right]], and the [[state]] is
no more bound to leave civil [[authority]] in the hands of its rulers than
military [[authority]] in the hands of its generals.

it is also true that it is impossible to be too careful to observe,
in such cases, all the formalities necessary to distinguish a regular
and legitimate act from a seditious tumult, and the will of a whole
people from the clamour of a faction. here above all no further
concession should be made to the untoward possibility than cannot, in
the strictest [[logic]], be refused it. from this obligation the prince
derives a [[great]] advantage in preserving his [[power]] despite the [[people]],
without it being possible to say he has usurped it; for, seeming to
avail himself only of his rights [[right]], he finds it very easy to extend them,
and to prevent, under the pretext of keeping the [[peace]], assemblies that
are destined to the re-establishment of order; with the result that he
takes advantage of a [[silence]] he does not allow to be broken, or of
irregularities he causes to be committed, to assume that he has the
support of those whom [[fear]] prevents from speaking, and to punish those
who dare to speak. thus it was that the decemvirs, first elected for
one year and then kept on in office for a second, tried to perpetuate
their [[power]] by forbidding the comitia to assemble; and by this easy
method every [[government]] in the [[world]], once clothed with the public
power, sooner or later usurps the [[sovereign]] [[authority]].

the periodical assemblies of which i have already spoken are designed
to prevent or postpone this calamity, above all when they need no
formal summoning; for in that case, the [[prince]] cannot stop them without
openly declaring himself a law-breaker and an [[enemy]] of the [[state]].

the opening of these assemblies, whose sole object is the maintenance
of the social treaty, should always take the form of putting two
propositions that may not be suppressed, which should be voted on
separately.

the first is: "does it please the [[sovereign]] to preserve the present
form of [[government]]?"

the second is: "does it please the [[people]] to leave its administration
in the hands of those who are actually in charge of it?"

i am here assuming what i [[think]] i have shown; that there is in the
state no fundamental [[law]] that cannot be revoked, not excluding the
social compact itself; for if all the [[citizens]] assembled of one accord
to break the compact, it is impossible to [[doubt]] that it would be very
legitimately broken. grotius even thinks [[think]] that each [[man]] can renounce his
membership of his own [[state]], and recover his [[natural]] [[liberty]] and his
goods on leaving the [[country]].[1] it would be indeed absurd if all the
citizens in assembly could not do what each can do by himself.


[1] provided, of course, he does not leave to escape his obligations
and avoid having to serve his [[country]] in the hour of need. flight
in such a case would be [[criminal]] and punishable, and would be, not
withdrawal, but desertion.




book iv

chapter i

that the general will is indestructible


as long as several [[men]] in assembly regard themselves as a [[single]] [[body]],
they have only a [[single]] will which is concerned with their common
preservation and general well-being. in this case, all the springs of
the [[state]] are vigorous and simple and its rules [[rule]] clear and luminous;
there are no embroilments or conflicts of interests; the [[common]] [[good]] is
everywhere clearly apparent, and only [[good]] sense is needed to perceive
it. [[peace]], unity and equality are the enemies [[enemy]] of [[political]] subtleties.
men who are upright and simple are difficult to [[deceive]] because of
their simplicity; lures and ingenious pretexts fail to impose upon
them, and they are not even subtle enough to be dupes. when, among the
happiest [[people]] in the [[world]], bands of peasants are seen regulating
affairs of [[state]] under an oak, and always acting wisely, can we help
scorning the ingenious methods of other nations, which make themselves
illustrious and wretched with so much art [[arts]] and mystery?

a [[state]] so governed needs very few laws [[law]]; and, as it becomes necessary
to issue new ones, the necessity is universally seen. the first [[man]] to
propose them merely says what all have already [[felt]], and there is no
question of factions or intrigues or eloquence in order to secure the
passage into [[law]] of what every one has already decided to do, as soon
as he is sure that the rest will act with him.

theorists are [[led]] into error because, seeing only states that have
been from the beginning wrongly constituted, they are struck by the
impossibility of applying such a policy to them. they make [[great]] game
of all the absurdities a clever rascal or an insinuating speaker might
get the [[people]] of [[paris]] or [[london]] to [[believe]]. they do not [[know]] that
cromwell would have been put to "the bells" by the [[people]] of berne, and
the due de beaufort on the treadmill by the genevese.

but when the social bond begins to be relaxed and the [[state]] to grow
weak, when particular interests begin to make themselves [[felt]] and the
smaller societies [[society]] to exercise an influence over the larger, the common
interest changes [[change]] and finds opponents: [[opinion]] is no longer unanimous;
the general will ceases to be the will of all; contradictory views and
debates arise; and the [[best]] [[advice]] is not taken without [[question]].

finally, when the [[state]], on the eve of ruin, maintains only a [[vain]],
illusory and formal existence, when in every [[heart]] the social bond
is broken, and the meanest interest brazenly lays hold of the sacred
name of "public [[good]]," the general will becomes mute: all [[men]], guided
by secret motives, no more give their views as [[citizens]] than if the
state had never been; and iniquitous decrees directed solely to private
interest get passed under the name of laws [[law]].

does it [[follow]] from this that the general will is exterminated or
corrupted? not at all: it is always constant, unalterable and pure; but
it is subordinated to other wills which encroach upon its sphere. each
man, in detaching, his interest from the [[common]] interest, sees clearly
that he cannot entirely separate them; but his share in the public
mishaps seems to him negligible beside the exclusive [[good]] he aims at
making his own. apart from this particular [[good]], he wills the general
good in his own interest, as strongly as any one else. even in selling
his vote for [[money]], he does not extinguish in himself the general
will, but only eludes it. the [[fault]] he commits is that of changing the
state of the [[question]], and answering something different from what he
is [[asked]]. instead of saying, by his vote, "it is to the advantage of
the [[state]]," he says, "it is of advantage to this or that [[man]] or party
that this or that view should prevail." thus the [[law]] of [[public]] order
in assemblies is not so much to maintain in them the general will as
to secure that the [[question]] be always put to it, and the [[answer]] always
given by it.

i could here set down many reflections on the simple [[right]] of voting
in every act of sovereignty--a [[right]] which no-one can take from the
citizens--and also on the [[right]] of stating views, making proposals,
dividing and discussing, which the [[government]] is always most careful
to leave solely to its members; but this important [[subject]] would need a
treatise to itself, and it is impossible to say everything in a single
work.




chapter ii

voting


it may be seen, from the [[last]] [[chapter]], that the way in which general
business is managed may give a clear enough indication of the actual
state of morals [[moral]] and the health of the [[body]] [[politic]]. the more concert
reigns in the assemblies, that is, the nearer [[opinion]] approaches
unanimity, the greater is the dominance of the general will. on
the other hand, long debates, dissensions and tumult proclaim the
ascendancy of particular interests and the decline of the [[state]].

this seems less clear when two or more orders enter into the
constitution, as patricians and plebeians did at [[rome]]; for quarrels
between these two orders often disturbed the comitia, even in the best
days of the [[republic]]. but the exception is rather apparent than real;
for then, through the defect that is inherent in the [[body]] [[politic]],
there were, so to speak, two states in one, and what is not true of
the two together is true of either separately. indeed, even in the
most stormy times [[time]], the plebiscita of the [[people]], when the senate did
not interfere with them, always went through quietly and by large
majorities. the [[citizens]] having but one interest, the [[people]] had but a
single will.

at the other extremity of the circle, unanimity recurs; this is the
case when the [[citizens]], having fallen into servitude, have lost both
liberty and will. [[fear]] and [[flattery]] then [[change]] votes into acclamation;
deliberation ceases, and only [[worship]] or malediction is left. such
was the vile manner in which the senate expressed its views under the
emperors. it did so sometimes with absurd precautions. tacitus observes
that, under otho, the senators, while they heaped curses on vitellius,
contrived at the same [[time]] to make a deafening noise, in order that,
should he ever become their master, he might not [[know]] what each of them
had said.

on these various considerations depend the rules [[rule]] by which the methods
of counting votes and comparing opinions [[opinion]] should be regulated, according
as the general will is more or less easy to discover, and the state
more or less in its decline.

there is but one [[law]] which, from its [[nature]], needs unanimous [[consent]].
this is the social compact; for civil association is the most voluntary
of all acts. every [[man]] being born [[free]] and his own master, no-one,
under any pretext whatsoever, can make any [[man]] [[subject]] without his
consent. to decide that the [[son]] of a [[slave]] is born a [[slave]] is to decide
that he is not born a [[man]].

if then there are opponents when the social compact is made, their
opposition does not invalidate the contract, but merely prevents them
from being included in it. they are foreigners among [[citizens]]. when the
state is instituted, residence constitutes [[consent]]; to dwell within its
territory is to submit to the [[sovereign]].[1]

apart from this primitive contract, the vote of the majority always
binds all the rest. this follows from the contract itself. but it is
asked how a [[man]] can be both [[free]] and forced to conform to wills that
are not his own. how are the opponents at once [[free]] and [[subject]] to laws
they have not agreed to?

i retort that the [[question]] is wrongly put. the citizen gives his
consent to all the laws [[law]], including those which are passed in spite of
his opposition, and even those which punish him when he dares to break
any of them. the constant will of all the members of the [[state]] is the
general will; by [[virtue]] of it they are [[citizens]] and [[free]].[2] when in
the popular assembly a [[law]] is proposed, what the [[people]] is [[asked]] is not
exactly whether it approves or rejects the proposal, but whether it is
in conformity with the general will, which is their will. each [[man]], in
giving his vote, states his [[opinion]] on that point; and the general will
is found by counting votes. when therefore the [[opinion]] that is contrary
to my own prevails, this proves neither more nor less than that i was
mistaken, and that what i [[thought]] to be the general will was not so. if
my particular [[opinion]] had carried the day i should have achieved the
opposite of what was my will and it is in that case that i should not
have been [[free]].

this presupposes, indeed, that all the qualities of the general will
still reside in the majority: when they cease to do so, whatever side a
man may take, [[liberty]] is no longer possible.

in my earlier demonstration of how particular wills are substituted
for the general will in [[public]] deliberation, i have adequately pointed
out the practicable methods of avoiding this [[abuse]]; and i shall have
more to say of them later on. i have also given the principles [[principle]] for
determining the proportional number of votes for declaring that will.
a difference of one vote destroys equality; a [[single]] opponent destroys
unanimity; but between equality and unanimity, there are several grades
of unequal division, at each of which this proportion may be fixed in
accordance with the condition and the needs of the [[body]] [[politic]].

there are two general rules [[rule]] that may serve to regulate this relation.
first, the more grave and important the questions [[question]] discussed, the nearer
should the [[opinion]] that is to prevail approach unanimity. secondly, the
more the matter in hand calls for speed, the smaller the prescribed
difference in the numbers of votes may be allowed to become: where an
instant decision has to be reached, a majority of one vote should be
enough. the first of these two rules [[rule]] seems more in harmony with the
laws, and the second with practical affairs. in any case, it is the
combination of them that gives the [[best]] proportions for determining the
majority necessary.


[1] this should of course be understood as applying to a [[free]] [[state]];
for elsewhere [[family]], goods [[good]], lack of a refuge, necessity, or violence
may detain a [[man]] in a [[country]] against his will; and then his dwelling
there no longer by itself implies his [[consent]] to the contract or to its
violation.

[2] at genoa, the word _liberty_ may be [[read]] over the front of the
prisons and on the chains of the galley-slaves. this application of the
device is [[good]] and just it is indeed only malefactors of all estates
who prevent the citizen from being [[free]]. in the [[country]] in which
all such [[men]] were in the galleys, the most [[perfect]] [[liberty]] would be
enjoyed.




chapter iii

elections


in the elections of the [[prince]] and the magistrates, which are, as i
have said, complex acts, there are two possible methods of procedure,
choice and lot. both have been employed in various republics [[republic]], and a
highly complicated mixture of the two still survives in the election of
the doge at venice.

"election by lot," says montesquieu, "is democratic in [[nature]]." i agree
that it is so; but in what sense? "the lot," he goes on, "is a way
of making [[choice]] that is unfair to nobody; it leaves each citizen a
reasonable [[hope]] of serving his [[country]]." these are not reasons [[reason]].

if we bear in [[mind]] that the election of rulers is a function of
government, and not of sovereignty, we shall see why the lot is the
method more [[natural]] to [[democracy]], in which the administration is better
in proportion as the number of its acts is small.

in every real [[democracy]], magistracy is not an advantage, but a
burdensome charge which cannot justly be imposed on one individual
rather than another. the [[law]] alone can lay the charge on him on whom
the lot falls. for, the conditions being then the same for all, and
the [[choice]] not depending on any [[human]] will, there is no particular
application to alter the universality of the [[law]].

in an [[aristocracy]], the [[prince]] chooses the [[prince]], the [[government]] is
preserved by itself, and voting is rightly ordered.

the instance of the election of the doge of venice confirms, instead
of destroying, this distinction; the mixed form suits a mixed
government. for it is an error to take the [[government]] of venice for a
real [[aristocracy]]. if the [[people]] has no share in the [[government]], the
nobility is itself the [[people]]. a host of [[poor]] barnabotes never gets
near any magistracy, and its nobility consists merely in the empty
title of excellency, and in the [[right]] to sit in the [[great]] council. as
this [[great]] council is as numerous as our general council at geneva, its
illustrious members have no more privileges [[privilege]] than our plain [[citizens]].
it is indisputable that, apart from the extreme disparity between the
two republics [[republic]], the _bourgeoisie_ of geneva is exactly equivalent to the
_patriciate_ of venice; our _natives_ and _inhabitants_ correspond to
the _townsmen_ and the _people_ of venice; our _peasants_ correspond
to the _subjects_ on the mainland; and, however that [[republic]] be
regarded, if its size be left out of account, its [[government]] is no more
aristocratic than our own. the whole difference is that, having no
life-ruler, we do not, like venice, need to use the lot.

election by lot would have few disadvantages in a real [[democracy]], in
which, as equality would everywhere [[exist]] in morals [[moral]] and [[talents]] as
well as in principles [[principle]] and fortunes [[fortune]], it would become almost a matter
of indifference who was chosen. but i have already said that a real
democracy is only an ideal.

when [[choice]] and lot are combined, positions that require special
talents, such as [[military]] posts, should be filled by the former; the
latter does for cases, such as judicial offices, in which [[good]] sense,
justice, and integrity are enough, because in a [[state]] that is well
constituted, these qualities are [[common]] to all the [[citizens]].

neither lot nor vote has any place in monarchical [[government]]. the
monarch being by [[right]] sole [[prince]] and only magistrate, the [[choice]] of
his lieutenants belongs to none but him. when the abbé de saint-pierre
proposed that the councils of the [[king]] of [[france]] should be multiplied,
and their members elected by ballot, he did not see that he was
proposing to [[change]] the form of [[government]].

i should now speak of the methods of giving and counting opinions [[opinion]] in
the assembly of the [[people]]; but perhaps an account of this aspect of
the roman [[constitution]] will more forcibly illustrate all the rules [[rule]] i
could lay down. it is worth the while of a judicious reader to follow
in some detail the working of [[public]] and private affairs in a council
consisting of two hundred thousand [[men]].




chapter iv

the roman comitia


we are without well-certified records of the first period of rome's
existence; it even appears very probable that most of the stories told
about it are fables; indeed, generally speaking, the most instructive
part of the [[history]] of peoples [[people]], that which deals with their foundation,
is what we have least of. [[experience]] teaches [[teach]] us every day what causes
lead to the revolutions [[revolution]] of empires; but, as no new peoples [[people]] are now
formed, we have almost nothing beyond conjecture to go upon in
explaining how they were created.

the customs we find established show at least that these customs had
an origin. the traditions that go back to those origins, that have
the [[greatest]] authorities [[authority]] behind them, and that are confirmed by the
strongest proofs, should pass for the most [[certain]]. these are the rules
i have tried to [[follow]] in inquiring how the freest and most powerful
people on [[earth]] exercised its supreme [[power]].

after the foundation of [[rome]], the new-born [[republic]], that is, the
army of its founder, composed of albans, sabines and foreigners, was
divided into three classes, which, from this division, took the name
of _tribes_. each of these tribes was subdivided into ten _curiæ_, and
each _curia_ into _decuriæ_, headed by leaders called _curiones_ and
_decuriones_.

besides this, out of each tribe was taken a [[body]] of one hundred
_equites_ or knights, called a _century_, which shows that these
divisions, being unnecessary in a town, were at first merely [[military]].
but an instinct for greatness seems to have [[led]] the little township of
rome to provide itself in advance with a [[political]] [[system]] suitable for
the [[capital]] of the [[world]].

out of this original division an awkward situation soon arose. the
tribes of the albans (ramnenses) and the sabines (tatienses) remained
always in the same condition, while that of the foreigners (luceres)
continually grew as more and more foreigners came to [[live]] at [[rome]],
so that it soon surpassed the others in [[strength]]. servius remedied
this dangerous [[fault]] by changing the [[principle]] of cleavage, and
substituting for the racial division, which he abolished, a new one
based on the quarter of the town inhabited by each tribe. instead of
three tribes he created four, each occupying and named after one of the
hills of [[rome]]. thus, while redressing the inequality of the moment, he
also provided for the future; and in order that the division might be
one of persons [[person]] as well as localities, he forbade the inhabitants of one
quarter to migrate to another, and so prevented the mingling of the
races.

he also doubled the three old centuries of knights and added twelve
more, still keeping the old names, and by this simple and prudent
method, succeeded in making a distinction between the [[body]] of knights
and the [[people]], without a murmur from the latter.

to the four urban tribes servius added fifteen others called rural
tribes, because they consisted of those who lived in the [[country]],
divided into fifteen cantons. subsequently, fifteen more were created,
and the roman [[people]] finally found itself divided into thirty-five
tribes, as it remained down to the end of the [[republic]].

the distinction between urban and rural tribes had one effect which
is worth mention, both because it is without parallel elsewhere, and
because to it [[rome]] owed the preservation of her morality and the
enlargement of her [[empire]]. we should have expected that the urban
tribes would soon monopolise [[power]] and honours [[honour]], and lose no [[time]] in
bringing the rural tribes into disrepute; but what happened was exactly
the reverse. the taste of the early romans for [[country]] [[life]] is well
known. this taste they owed to their [[wise]] founder, who made rural and
military labours [[labour]] go along with [[liberty]], and, so to speak, relegated to
the town [[arts]], crafts, intrigue, [[fortune]] and [[slavery]].

since therefore all rome's most illustrious [[citizens]] lived in the
fields and tilled the [[earth]], [[men]] grew used to seeking there alone the
mainstays of the [[republic]]. this condition, being that of the best
patricians, was honoured by all [[men]]; the simple and laborious life
of the villager was preferred to the slothful and idle [[life]] of the
_bourgeoisie_ of [[rome]]; and he who, in the town, would have been but a
wretched proletarian, became, as a labourer in the fields, a respected
citizen. not without [[reason]], says varro, did our great-souled ancestors
establish in the village the nursery of the sturdy and valiant men
who defended them in [[time]] of [[war]] and provided for their sustenance in
time of [[peace]]. pliny states positively that the [[country]] tribes were
honoured because of the [[men]] of whom they were composed; while cowards
men wished to dishonour were transferred, as a [[public]] disgrace, to the
town tribes. the sabine appius claudius, when he had come to settle
in [[rome]], was loaded with honours [[honour]] and enrolled in a rural tribe, which
subsequently took his [[family]] name. lastly, freedmen always entered the
urban, and never the rural, tribes: nor is there a [[single]] [[example]],
throughout the [[republic]], of a freedman, though he had become a citizen,
reaching any magistracy.

this was an excellent [[rule]]; but it was carried so far that in the end
it [[led]] to a [[change]] and certainly to an [[abuse]] in the [[political]] [[system]].

first the censors, after having for a long [[time]] claimed the [[right]] of
transferring [[citizens]] arbitrarily from one tribe to another, allowed
most persons [[person]] to enrol themselves in whatever tribe they pleased. this
permission certainly did no [[good]], and further robbed the censorship
of one of its [[greatest]] resources. moreover, as the [[great]] and powerful
all got themselves enrolled in the [[country]] tribes, while the freedmen
who had become [[citizens]] remained with the populace in the town tribes,
both soon ceased to have any local or territorial meaning, and all were
so confused that the members of one could not be told from those of
another except by the registers; so that the [[idea]] of the word _tribe_
became personal instead of real, or rather came to be little more than
a chimera.

it happened in addition that the town tribes, being more on the spot,
were often the stronger in the comitia and sold the [[state]] to those who
stooped to buy the votes of the rabble composing them.

as the founder had set up ten _curiæ_ in each tribe, the whole roman
people, which was then contained within the walls, consisted of thirty
_curia_, each with its temples, its gods, its officers, its priests [[priest]] and
its festivals, which were called _compitalia_ and corresponded to the
_paganalia,_ held in later times [[time]] by the rural tribes.

when servius made his new division, as the thirty _curiæ_ could not be
shared equally between his four tribes, and as he was unwilling to
interfere with them, they became a further division of the inhabitants
of [[rome]], quite independent of the tribes: but in the case of the rural
tribes and their members there was no [[question]] of _curiæ_ as the
tribes had then become a purely civil institution, and, a new system
of levying [[troops]] having been introduced, the [[military]] divisions of
romulus were superfluous. thus, although every citizen was enrolled in
a tribe, there were very many who were not members of a _curia_.

servius made yet a third division, quite distinct from the two we have
mentioned, which became, in its effects, the most important of all.
he distributed the whole roman [[people]] into six classes, distinguished
neither by place nor by [[person]], but by [[wealth]]; the first classes
included the [[rich]], the [[last]] the [[poor]], and those between persons [[person]] of
moderate means. these six classes were subdivided into one hundred and
ninety-three other bodies [[body]], called centuries, which were so divided that
the first class alone comprised more than half of them, while the last
comprised only one. thus the class that had the smallest number of
members had the largest number of centuries, and the whole of the last
class only counted as a [[single]] subdivision, although it alone included
more than half the inhabitants of [[rome]].

in order that the [[people]] might have the less insight into the results
of this arrangement, servius tried to give it a [[military]] tone: in
the second class he inserted two centuries of armourers, and in the
fourth two of makers of instruments of [[war]]: in each class, except the
last, he distinguished [[young]] and old, that is, those who were under an
obligation to bear arms and those whose [[age]] gave them legal exemption.
it was this distinction, rather than that of [[wealth]], which required
frequent repetition of the census or counting. lastly, he ordered that
the assembly should be held in the campus martius, and that all who
were of [[age]] to serve should come there armed.

the [[reason]] for his not making in the [[last]] class also the division of
young and old was that the populace, of whom it was composed, was not
given the [[right]] to bear arms for its [[country]]: a [[man]] had to possess a
hearth to acquire the [[right]] to defend it, and of all the [[troops]] of
beggars who to-day lend lustre to the armies [[army]] of kings [[king]], there is perhaps
not one who would not have been driven with scorn out of a roman
cohort, at a [[time]] when soldiers were the defenders of [[liberty]].

in this [[last]] class, however, _proletarians_ were distinguished from
_capite censi._ the former, not quite reduced to nothing, at least gave
the [[state]] [[citizens]], and sometimes, when the need was pressing, even
soldiers. those who had nothing at all, and could be numbered only by
counting heads, were regarded as of absolutely no account, and marius
was the first who stooped to enrol them.

without deciding now whether this third arrangement was [[good]] or [[bad]] in
itself, i [[think]] i may assert that it could have been made practicable
only by the simple morals [[moral]], the disinterestedness, the liking for
agriculture and the scorn for commerce and for [[love]] of gain which
characterised the early romans. where is the [[modern]] [[people]] among whom
consuming greed, unrest, intrigue, continual removals, and perpetual
changes of [[fortune]], could let such a [[system]] [[last]] for twenty years
without turning the [[state]] upside down? we must indeed observe that
morality and the censorship, being stronger than this institution,
corrected its defects at [[rome]], and that the [[rich]] [[man]] found himself
degraded to the class of the [[poor]] for making too much display of his
riches.

from all this it is easy to [[understand]] why only five classes are
almost always mentioned, though there were really six. the sixth, as
it furnished neither soldiers to the [[army]] nor votes in the campus
martius,[1] and was almost without function in the [[state]], was seldom
regarded as of any account.

these were the various ways in which the roman [[people]] was divided. let
us now see the effect on the assemblies. when lawfully summoned, these
were called _comitia_: they were usually held in the [[public]] square
at [[rome]] or in the campus martius, and were distinguished as _comitia
curiata, comitia centuriata_, and _comitia tributa_, according to
the form under which they were convoked. the _comitia curiata_ were
founded by romulus; the _centuriata_ by servius; and the _tributa_
by the tribunes of the [[people]]. no [[law]] received its sanction and no
magistrate was elected, save in the comitia; and as every citizen
was enrolled in a _curia_, a century, or a tribe, it follows that no
citizen was excluded from the [[right]] of voting, and that the roman
people was truly [[sovereign]] both _de jure_ and _de facto_.

for the comitia to be lawfully assembled, and for their acts to have
the [[force]] of [[law]], three conditions were necessary. first, the body
or magistrate convoking them had to possess the necessary [[authority]];
secondly, the assembly had to be held on a day allowed by [[law]]; and
thirdly, the auguries had to be favourable.

the [[reason]] for the first regulation needs no explanation; the second is
a matter of policy. thus, the comitia might not be held on festivals
or market-days, when the country-folk, coming to [[rome]] on [[business]], had
not [[time]] to spend the day in the [[public]] square. by means of the third,
the senate held in check the proud and restive [[people]], and meetly
restrained the ardour of seditious tribunes, who, however, found more
than one way of escaping this hindrance.

laws and the election of rulers were not the only questions [[question]] submitted
to the [[judgment]] of the comitia: as the roman [[people]] had taken on itself
the most important functions of [[government]], it may be said that the lot
of [[europe]] was regulated in its assemblies. the variety of their objects
gave rise to the various forms these took, according to the matters on
which they had to pronounce.

in order to [[judge]] of these various forms, it is enough to compare
them. romulus, when he set up _curiæ_, had in view the checking of
the senate by the [[people]], and of the [[people]] by the senate, while
maintaining his ascendancy over both alike. he therefore gave the
people, by means of this assembly, all the [[authority]] of numbers to
balance that of [[power]] and riches [[rich]], which he left to the patricians.
but, after the spirit of [[monarchy]], he left all the same a greater
advantage to the patricians in the influence of their clients on the
majority of votes. this excellent institution of patron and client
was a masterpiece of statesmanship and [[humanity]] without which the
patriciate, being flagrantly in contradiction to the republican
spirit, could not have survived. [[rome]] alone has the [[honour]] of having
given to the [[world]] this [[great]] [[example]], which never [[led]] to any [[abuse]],
and yet has never been followed.

as the assemblies by _curiæ_ persisted under the kings [[king]] till the time
of servius, and the reign of the later tarquin was not regarded as
legitimate, [[royal]] laws [[law]] were called generally _leges curiatæ_.

under the [[republic]], the _curiæ_ still confined to the four urban
tribes, and including only the populace of [[rome]], suited neither the
senate, which [[led]] the patricians, nor the tribunes, who, though
plebeians, were at the head of the well-to-do [[citizens]]. they therefore
fell into disrepute, and their degradation was such, that thirty
lictors used to assemble and do what the _comitia curiata_ should have
done.

the division by centuries was so favourable to the [[aristocracy]] that it
is hard to see at first how the senate ever failed to carry the day in
the comitia bearing their name, by which the consuls, the censors and
the other curule magistrates were elected. indeed, of the hundred and
ninety-three centuries into which the six classes of the whole roman
people were divided, the first class contained ninety-eight; and, as
voting went solely by centuries, this class alone had a majority over
all the rest. when all these centuries were in agreement, the rest of
the votes were not even taken; the decision of the smallest number
passed for that of the multitude, and it may be said that, in the
_comitia centuriata_, decisions were regulated far more by depth of
purses than by the number of votes.

but this extreme [[authority]] was modified in two ways. first, the
tribunes as a [[rule]], and always a [[great]] number of plebeians, belonged
to the class of the [[rich]], and so counterbalanced the influence of the
patricians in the first class.

the second way was this. instead of causing the centuries to vote
throughout in order, which would have meant beginning always with the
first, the romans always chose one by lot which proceeded alone to
the election; after this all the centuries were summoned another day
according to their rank, and the same election was repeated, and as a
rule confirmed. thus the [[authority]] of [[example]] was taken away from rank,
and given to the lot on a democratic [[principle]].

from this custom resulted a further advantage. the [[citizens]] from the
country had [[time]], between the two elections, to inform themselves of
the merits [[merit]] of the candidate who had been provisionally nominated,
and did not have to vote without [[knowledge]] of the case. but, under
the pretext of hastening matters, the abolition of this custom was
achieved, and both elections were held on the same day.

the _comitia tributa_ were properly the council of the roman [[people]].
they were convoked by the tribunes alone; at them the tribunes were
elected and passed their plebiscita. the senate not only had no
standing in them, but even no [[right]] to be [[present]]; and the senators,
being forced to obey laws [[law]] on which they could not vote, were in this
respect less [[free]] than the meanest [[citizens]]. this [[injustice]] was
altogether ill-conceived, and was alone enough to invalidate the
decrees of a [[body]] to which all its members were not admitted. had all
the patricians attended the comitia by [[virtue]] of the [[right]] they had as
citizens, they would not, as mere private individuals [[individual]], have had any
considerable influence on a vote reckoned by counting heads, where the
meanest proletarian was as [[good]] as the _princeps senatus_.

it may be seen, therefore, that besides the order which was achieved
by these various ways of distributing so [[great]] a [[people]] and taking its
votes, the various methods were not reducible to forms indifferent in
themselves, but the results of each were relative to the objects which
caused it to be preferred.

without going here into further details, we may gather from what has
been said above that the _comitia tributa_ were the most favourable to
popular [[government]], and the _comitia centuriata_ to [[aristocracy]]. the
_comitia curiata,_ in which the populace of [[rome]] formed the majority,
being fitted only to further [[tyranny]] and [[evil]] designs, naturally fell
into disrepute, and even seditious persons [[person]] abstained from using a
method which too clearly revealed their projects. it is indisputable
that the whole majesty of the roman [[people]] lay solely in the _comitia
centuriata_, which alone included all; for the _comitia curiata_
excluded the rural tribes, and the _comitia tributa_ the senate and the
patricians.

as for the method of taking the vote, it was among the ancient romans
as simple as their morals [[moral]], although not so simple as at sparta. each
man declared his vote aloud, and a clerk duly wrote it down; the
majority in each tribe determined the vote of the tribe, the majority
of the tribes that of the [[people]], and so with _curiæ_ and centuries.
this custom was [[good]] as long as honesty was triumphant among the
citizens, and each [[man]] was ashamed to vote publicly in favour of an
unjust proposal or an unworthy [[subject]]; but, when the [[people]] grew
corrupt and votes were bought, it was fitting that voting should be
secret in order that purchasers might be restrained by mistrust, and
rogues be given the means of not being traitors.

i [[know]] that cicero attacks this [[change]], and attributes partly to it the
ruin of the [[republic]]. but though i [[feel]] the weight cicero's authority
must carry on such a point, i cannot agree with him; i hold, on the
contrary, that, for want of enough such changes [[change]], the destruction of the
state must be hastened. just as the regimen of health does riot suit
the sick, we should not [[wish]] to govern a [[people]] that has been corrupted
by the laws [[law]] that a [[good]] [[people]] requires. there is no [[better]] proof of
this [[rule]] than the long [[life]] of the [[republic]] of venice, of which the
shadow still exists, solely because its laws [[law]] are suitable only for men
who are wicked.

the [[citizens]] were provided, therefore, with tablets by means of which
each [[man]] could vote without any one knowing how he voted: new methods
were also introduced for collecting the tablets, for counting voices,
for comparing numbers, etc.; but all these precautions did not prevent
the [[good]] [[faith]] of the officers charged with these functions[2] from
being often suspect. finally, to prevent intrigues and trafficking in
votes, edicts were issued; but their very number proves how useless
they were.

towards the close of the [[republic]], it was often necessary to have
recourse to extraordinary expedients in order to supplement the
inadequacy of the laws [[law]]. sometimes [[miracles]] were supposed; but this
method, while it might impose on the [[people]], could not impose on those
who governed. sometimes an assembly was hastily called together,
before the candidates had [[time]] to form their factions: sometimes a
whole sitting was occupied with talk, when it was seen that the people
had been won over and was on the point of taking up a [[wrong]] position.
but in the end [[ambition]] eluded all attempts to check it; and the most
incredible [[fact]] of all is that, in the midst of all these abuses [[abuse]],
the vast [[people]], thanks to its ancient regulations, never ceased to
elect magistrates, to pass laws [[law]], to [[judge]] cases, and to carry through
business both [[public]] and private, almost as easily as the senate itself
could have done.


[1] i say "in the campus martius" because it was there that the comitia
assembled by centuries; in its two other forms the [[people]] assembled
in the _forum_ or elsewhere; and then the _capite censi_ had as much
influence and [[authority]] as the foremost [[citizens]].

chapter v

the tribunate


when an exact proportion cannot be established between the constituent
parts of the [[state]], or when causes that cannot be removed continually
alter the relation of one part to another, recourse is had to the
institution of a peculiar magistracy that enters into no corporate
unity with the rest. this restores to each term its [[right]] relation to
the others, and provides a link or middle term between either prince
and [[people]], or [[prince]] and [[sovereign]], or, if necessary, both at once.

this [[body]], which i shall call the _tribunate_, is the preserver of the
laws and of the legislative [[power]]. it serves sometimes to [[protect]] the
sovereign against the [[government]], as the tribunes of the [[people]] did
at [[rome]]; sometimes to uphold the [[government]] against the [[people]], as
the council of ten now does at venice; and sometimes to maintain the
balance between the two, as the ephors did at sparta.

the tribunate is not a constituent part of the [[city]], and should have
no share in either legislative or executive [[power]]; but this very fact
makes its own [[power]] the greater: for, while it can do nothing, it can
prevent anything from being done. it is more [[sacred]] and more revered,
as the defender of the laws [[law]], than the [[prince]] who executes them, or than
the [[sovereign]] which ordains them. this was seen very clearly at [[rome]],
when the proud patricians, for all their scorn of the [[people]], were
forced to bow before one of its officers, who had neither auspices nor
jurisdiction.

the tribunate, wisely tempered, is the strongest support a good
constitution can have; but if its [[strength]] is ever so little excessive,
it upsets the whole [[state]]. weakness, on the other hand, is not natural
to it: provided it is something, it is never less than it should be.

it degenerates into [[tyranny]] when it usurps the executive [[power]], which
it should confine itself to restraining, and when it tries to dispense
with the laws [[law]], which it should confine itself to protecting. the
immense [[power]] of the ephors, harmless as long as sparta preserved its
morality, hastened [[corruption]] when once it had begun. the [[blood]] of
agis, slaughtered by these tyrants [[tyrant]], was avenged by his successor; the
crime and the [[punishment]] of the ephors alike hastened the destruction
of the [[republic]], and after cleomenes sparta ceased to be of any
account. [[rome]] perished in the same way: the excessive [[power]] of the
tribunes, which they had usurped by degrees [[degree]], finally served, with the
help of laws [[law]] made to secure [[liberty]], as a safeguard for the emperors
who destroyed it. as for the venetian council of ten, it is a tribunal
of [[blood]], an object of [[horror]] to patricians and [[people]] alike; and, so
far from giving a lofty protection to the laws [[law]], it does nothing, now
they have become degraded, but strike in the darkness blows of which no
one dare take note.

the tribunate, like the [[government]], grows [[weak]] as the number of its
members increases. when the tribunes of the roman [[people]], who first
numbered only two, and then five, wished to double that number, the
senate let them do so, in the confidence that it could use one to check
another, as indeed it afterwards freely did.

the [[best]] method of preventing usurpations by so formidable a [[body]],
though no [[government]] has yet made use of it, would be not to make it
permanent, but to regulate the periods during which it should remain
in abeyance. these intervals, which should not be long enough to give
abuses [[time]] to grow [[strong]], may be so fixed by [[law]] that they can easily
be shortened at need by extraordinary commissions.

this method seems to me to have no disadvantages, because, as i have
said, the tribunate, which forms no part of the [[constitution]], can be
removed without the [[constitution]] being affected. it seems to be also
efficacious, because a newly restored magistrate starts not with the
power his predecessor exercised, but with that which the [[law]] allows him.




chapter vi

the dictatorship


the inflexibility of the laws [[law]], which prevents them from adapting
themselves to circumstances, may, in [[certain]] cases, render them
disastrous, and make them bring about, at a [[time]] of crisis, the ruin
of the [[state]]. the order and slowness of the forms they enjoin require
a space of [[time]] which circumstances sometimes withhold. a thousand
cases against which the legislator has made no provision may present
themselves, and it is a highly necessary part of foresight to be
conscious that everything cannot be foreseen.

it is [[wrong]] therefore to [[wish]] to make [[political]] [[institutions]] so strong
as to render it impossible to suspend their operation. even sparta
allowed its laws [[law]] to lapse.

however, none but the [[greatest]] dangers can counter-balance that of
changing the [[public]] order, and the [[sacred]] [[power]] of the laws [[law]] should
never be arrested save when the existence of the [[country]] is at stake.
in these rare and obvious cases, provision is made for the public
security by a particular act entrusting it to him who is most worthy.
this commitment may be carried out in either of two ways, according to
the [[nature]] of the danger.

if increasing the activity of the [[government]] is a sufficient remedy,
power is concentrated in the hands of one or two of its members: in
this case the [[change]] is not in the [[authority]] of the laws [[law]], but only in
the form of administering them. if, on the other hand, the peril is
of such a [[kind]] that the paraphernalia of the laws [[law]] are an obstacle to
their preservation, the method is to nominate a supreme ruler, who
shall [[silence]] all the laws [[law]] and suspend for a moment the sovereign
authority. in such a case, there is no [[doubt]] about the general will,
and it is clear that the people's first intention is that the state
shall not perish. thus the suspension of the legislative [[authority]] is
in no sense its abolition; the magistrate who silences it cannot make
it speak; he dominates it, but cannot represent it. he can do anything,
except make laws [[law]].

the first method was used by the roman senate when, in a consecrated
formula, it charged the consuls to provide for the safety of the
republic. the second was employed when one of the two consuls nominated
a dictator:[1] a custom [[rome]] borrowed from alba.

during the first period of the [[republic]], recourse was very often had to
the dictatorship, because the [[state]] had not yet a firm enough basis to
be able to maintain itself by the [[strength]] of its [[constitution]] alone.
as the [[state]] of morality then made superfluous many of the precautions
which would have been necessary at other times [[time]], there was no [[fear]] that
a dictator would [[abuse]] his [[authority]], or try to keep it beyond his term
of office. on the contrary, so much [[power]] appeared to be burdensome
to him who was clothed with it, and he made all speed to lay it down,
as if taking the place of the laws [[law]] had been too troublesome and too
perilous a position to retain.

it is therefore the danger not of its [[abuse]], but of its cheapening,
that makes me attack the indiscreet use of this supreme magistracy in
the earliest times [[time]]. for as long as it was freely employed at elections,
dedications and purely formal functions, there was danger of its
becoming less formidable in [[time]] of need, and of [[men]] growing accustomed
to regarding as empty a title that was used only on occasions [[occasion]] of empty
ceremonial.

towards the end of the [[republic]], the romans, having grown more
circumspect, were as unreasonably sparing in the use of the
dictatorship as they had formerly been lavish. it is easy to see
that their fears [[fear]] were without foundation, that the weakness of the
capital secured it against the magistrates who were in its midst; that
a dictator might, in [[certain]] cases, defend the [[public]] [[liberty]], but
could never endanger it; and that the chains of [[rome]] would be forged,
not in [[rome]] itself, but in her armies [[army]]. the [[weak]] [[resistance]] offered by
marius to sulla, and by pompey to cæsar, clearly showed what was to be
expected from [[authority]] at [[home]] against [[force]] from abroad.

this misconception [[led]] the romans to make [[great]] mistakes; such, for
example, as the failure to nominate a dictator in the catilinarian
conspiracy. for, as only the [[city]] itself, with at most some province
in [[italy]], was concerned, the unlimited [[authority]] the laws [[law]] gave to the
dictator would have enabled him to make short [[work]] of the conspiracy,
which was, in [[fact]], stifled only by a combination of lucky chances
human prudence had no [[right]] to expect.

instead, the senate contented itself with entrusting its whole power
to the consuls, so that cicero, in order to take effective action, was
compelled on a [[capital]] point to exceed his powers [[power]]; and if, in the first
transports of joy, his conduct was approved, he was justly called,
later on, to account for the [[blood]] of [[citizens]] spilt in violation of
the laws [[law]]. such a reproach could never have been levelled at a dictator.
but the consul's eloquence carried the day; and he himself, roman
though he was, loved his own [[glory]] [[better]] than his [[country]], and sought,
not so much the most lawful and secure means of saving the [[state]], as to
get for himself the whole [[honour]] of having done so.[2] he was therefore
justly honoured as the liberator of [[rome]], and also justly punished
as a law-breaker. however brilliant his recall may have been, it was
undoubtedly an act of pardon.

however this important trust be conferred, it is important that its
duration should be fixed at a very brief period, incapable of being
ever prolonged. in the crises which lead to its adoption, the state
is either soon lost, or soon saved; and, the [[present]] need passed,
the dictatorship becomes either [[tyrannical]] or idle. at [[rome]], where
dictators held office for six months only, most of them abdicated
before their [[time]] was up. if their term had been longer, they might
well have tried to prolong it still further, as the decemvirs did when
chosen for a year. the dictator had only [[time]] to provide against the
need that had caused him to be chosen; he had none to [[think]] of further
projects.


[1] the nomination was made secretly by night, as if there were
something shameful in setting a [[man]] above the laws [[law]].

[2] that is what he could not be sure of, if he proposed a dictator;
for he dared not nominate himself, and could not be [[certain]] that his
colleague would nominate him.




chapter vii

the censorship


as the [[law]] is the declaration of the general will, the censorship is
the declaration of the [[public]] [[judgment]]: [[public]] [[opinion]] is the form of
law which the censor administers, and, like the [[prince]], only applies to
particular cases.

the censorial tribunal, so far from being the arbiter of the people's
opinion, only declares it, and, as soon as the two part company, its
decisions are null and void.

it is useless to distinguish the morality of a nation from the objects
of its esteem; both depend on the same [[principle]] and are necessarily
indistinguishable. there is no [[people]] on [[earth]] the [[choice]] of whose
pleasures is not decided by [[opinion]] rather than [[nature]]. [[right]] men's
opinions, and their morality will purge itself. [[men]] always [[love]] what is
good or what they find [[good]]; it is in judging what is [[good]] that they
go [[wrong]]. this [[judgment]], therefore, is what must be regulated. he who
judges of morality judges [[judge]] of [[honour]]; and he who judges [[judge]] of [[honour]] finds
his [[law]] in [[opinion]].

the opinions [[opinion]] of a [[people]] are derived from its [[constitution]]; although
the [[law]] does not regulate morality, it is legislation that gives it
birth. when legislation grows [[weak]], morality degenerates; but in such
cases the [[judgment]] of the censors will not do what the [[force]] of the
laws has failed to effect.

from this it follows that the censorship may be useful for the
preservation of morality, but can never be so for its restoration. set
up censors while the laws [[law]] are vigorous; as soon as they have lost their
vigour, all [[hope]] is gone; no legitimate [[power]] can retain [[force]] when
the laws [[law]] have lost it.

the censorship upholds morality by preventing [[opinion]] from growing
corrupt, by preserving its rectitude by means of [[wise]] applications, and
sometimes even by fixing it when it is still uncertain. the employment
of seconds in duels, which had been carried to wild extremes in the
kingdom of [[france]], was done away with merely by these words in a royal
edict: "as for those who are cowards enough to call upon seconds." this
judgment, in anticipating that of the [[public]], suddenly decided it. but
when edicts from the same source tried to pronounce duelling itself an
act of cowardice, as indeed it is, then, since [[common]] [[opinion]] does not
regard it as such, the [[public]] took no notice of a decision on a point
on which its [[mind]] was already made up.

i have stated elsewhere[1] that as [[public]] [[opinion]] is not [[subject]] to
any constraint, there need be no trace of it in the tribunal set up to
represent it. it is impossible to [[admire]] too much the art [[arts]] with which
this resource, which we moderns have wholly lost, was employed by the
romans, and still more by the lacedæmonians.

a [[man]] of [[bad]] morals [[moral]] having made a [[good]] proposal in the spartan council,
the ephors neglected it, and caused the same proposal to be made by a
virtuous citizen. what an [[honour]] for the one, and what a disgrace for
the other, without [[praise]] or blame of either! [[certain]] drunkards from
samos[2] polluted the tribunal of the ephors: the next day, a public
edict gave samians permission to be filthy. an actual [[punishment]] would
not have been so severe as such an impunity. when sparta has pronounced
on what is or is not [[right]], greece makes no appeal from her judgments [[judgment]].


[1] i merely call attention in this [[chapter]] to a [[subject]] with which i
have dealt at greater length in my _letter to m. d'alembert_.

[2] they were from another island, which the delicacy of our language
forbids me to name on this [[occasion]].




chapter viii

civil religion


at first [[men]] had no kings [[king]] save the gods, and no [[government]] save
theocracy. they reasoned like caligula, and, at that period, reasoned
aright. it takes a long [[time]] for feeling so to [[change]] that [[men]] can make
up their minds [[mind]] to take their equals [[equal]] as masters, in the [[hope]] that they
will [[profit]] by doing so.

from the mere [[fact]] that [[god]] was set over every [[political]] [[society]], it
followed that there were as many gods as peoples [[people]]. two peoples [[people]] that were
strangers the one to the other, and almost always enemies [[enemy]], could not
long recognise the same master: two armies [[army]] giving [[battle]] could not obey
the same leader. national divisions thus [[led]] to polytheism, and this in
turn gave rise to theological and civil intolerance, which, as we shall
see hereafter, are by [[nature]] the same.

the fancy the greeks [[greek]] had for rediscovering their gods among the
barbarians arose from the way they had of regarding themselves as the
natural sovereigns [[sovereign]] of such peoples [[people]]. but there is nothing so absurd
as the erudition which in our days identifies and confuses gods of
different nations. as if moloch, saturn and chronos could be the same
god! as if the phœnician baal, the [[greek]] [[zeus]], and the latin jupiter
could be the same! as if there could still be anything [[common]] to
imaginary beings with different names!

if it is [[asked]] how in pagan times [[time]], where each [[state]] had its cult
and its gods, there were no wars [[war]] of [[religion]], i [[answer]] that it was
precisely because each [[state]], having its own cult as well as its
own [[government]], made no distinction between its gods and its laws [[law]].
political [[war]] was also theological; the provinces of the gods were, so
to speak, fixed by the boundaries of nations. the [[god]] of one [[people]] had
no [[right]] over another. the gods of the pagans were not [[jealous]] gods;
they shared among themselves the [[empire]] of the [[world]]: even [[moses]] and
the hebrews sometimes lent themselves to this view by speaking of the
god of [[israel]]. it is true, they regarded as powerless the gods of
the canaanites, a proscribed [[people]] condemned to destruction, whose
place they were to take; but [[remember]] how they spoke of the divisions
of the neighbouring peoples [[people]] they were forbidden to attack! "is not
the possession of what belongs to your [[god]] chamos lawfully your due?"
said jephthah to the ammonites. "we have the same title to the lands
our conquering [[god]] has made his own."[1] here, i [[think]], there is a
recognition that the rights [[right]] of chamos and those of the [[god]] of israel
are of the same [[nature]].

but when the [[jews]], being [[subject]] to the kings [[king]] of [[babylon]], and,
subsequently, to those of syria, still obstinately refused to recognise
any [[god]] save their own, their refusal was regarded as rebellion against
their conqueror, and drew down on them the persecutions we [[read]] of
in their [[history]], which are without parallel till the coming of
christianity.[2]

every [[religion]], therefore, being attached solely to the laws [[law]] of the
state which prescribed it, there was no way of converting a people
except by enslaving it, and there could be no missionaries save
conquerors. the obligation to [[change]] cults being the [[law]] to which the
vanquished yielded, it was necessary to be victorious before suggesting
such a [[change]]. so far from [[men]] fighting for the gods, the gods, as in
homer, fought for [[men]]; each [[asked]] his [[god]] for [[victory]], and repayed him
with new altars. the romans, before taking a [[city]], summoned its gods
to quit it; and, in leaving the tarentines their outraged gods, they
regarded them as [[subject]] to their own and compelled to do them homage.
they left the vanquished their gods as they left them their laws [[law]]. a
wreath to the [[jupiter]] of the capitol was often the only tribute they
imposed.

finally, when, along with their [[empire]], the romans had spread their
cult and their gods, and had themselves often adopted those of the
vanquished, by granting to both alike the rights [[right]] of the [[city]], the
peoples of that vast [[empire]] insensibly found themselves with multitudes
of gods and cults, everywhere almost the same; and thus paganism
throughout the known [[world]] finally came to be one and the same [[religion]].

it was in these circumstances that [[jesus]] came to set up on [[earth]] a
spiritual [[kingdom]], which, by separating the theological from the
political [[system]], made the [[state]] no longer one, and brought about
the internal divisions which have never ceased to trouble christian
peoples. as the new [[idea]] of a [[kingdom]] of the other [[world]] could never
have occurred to pagans, they always looked on the christians [[christian]] as really
rebels, who, while feigning to submit, were only waiting for the chance
to make themselves independent and their masters, and to usurp by guile
the [[authority]] they pretended in their weakness to [[respect]]. this was the
cause of the persecutions.

what the pagans had feared took place. then everything changed its
aspect: the humble christians [[christian]] changed their [[language]], and soon this
so-called [[kingdom]] of the other [[world]] turned, under a visible leader,
into the most [[violent]] of earthly despotisms.

however, as there have always been a [[prince]] and civil laws [[law]], this double
power and conflict of jurisdiction have made all [[good]] polity impossible
in [[christian]] states; and [[men]] have never succeeded in finding out
whether they were bound to obey the master or the [[priest]].

several peoples [[people]], however, even in [[europe]] and its neighbourhood, have
desired without [[success]] to preserve or restore the old [[system]]: but
the spirit of [[christianity]] has everywhere prevailed. the [[sacred]] cult
has always remained or again become independent of the [[sovereign]], and
there has been no necessary link between it and the [[body]] of the [[state]].
mahomet held very sane views, and linked his [[political]] [[system]] well
together; and, as long as the form of his [[government]] continued under
the caliphs who succeeded him, that [[government]] was indeed one, and so
far [[good]]. but the arabs, having grown prosperous, lettered, civilised,
slack and cowardly, were conquered by barbarians: the division between
the two powers [[power]] began again; and, although it is less apparent among
the mahometans than among the christians [[christian]], it none the less exists,
especially in the sect of ali, and there are states, such as [[persia]],
where it is continually making itself [[felt]].

among us, the kings [[king]] of [[england]] have made themselves heads of the
church, and the czars have done the same: but this title has made them
less its masters than its ministers; they have gained not so much the
right to [[change]] it, as the [[power]] to maintain it: they are not its
legislators, but only its princes [[prince]]. wherever the clergy is a corporate
body,[3] it is master and legislator in its own [[country]]. there are
thus two powers [[power]], two sovereigns [[sovereign]], in [[england]] and in russia, as well as
elsewhere.

of all [[christian]] writers, the philosopher hobbes alone has seen the
evil and how to remedy it, and has dared to propose the reunion of the
two heads of the eagle, and the restoration throughout of political
unity, without which no [[state]] or [[government]] will ever be rightly
constituted. but he should have seen that the masterful spirit of
christianity is incompatible with his [[system]], and that the priestly
interest would always be stronger than that of the [[state]]. it is not so
much what is false and terrible in his [[political]] theory, as what is
just and true, that has drawn down [[hatred]] on it.[4]

i [[believe]] that if the study of [[history]] were developed from this point
of view, it would be easy to refute the contrary opinions [[opinion]] of bayle and
warburton, one of whom holds that [[religion]] can be of no use to the body
politic, while the other, on the contrary, maintains that christianity
is its strongest support. we should demonstrate to the former that
no [[state]] has ever been founded without a [[religious]] basis, and to the
latter, that the [[law]] of [[christianity]] at bottom does more harm by
weakening than [[good]] by strengthening the [[constitution]] of the [[state]]. to
make myself understood, i have only to make a little more exact the too
vague ideas [[idea]] of [[religion]] as relating to this [[subject]].

religion, considered in relation to [[society]], which is either general
or particular, may also be divided into two kinds [[kind]]: the [[religion]] of
man, and that of the citizen. the first, which has neither temples,
nor altars, nor rites, and is confined to the purely internal cult
of the supreme [[god]] and the eternal obligations of morality, is the
religion of the gospel pure and simple, the true theism, what may be
called [[natural]] [[divine]] [[right]] or [[law]]. the other, which is codified in a
single [[country]], gives it its gods, its own tutelary patrons; it has its
dogmas, its rites, and its external cult prescribed by [[law]]; outside the
single nation that follows it, all the [[world]] is in its sight infidel,
foreign and barbarous; the duties [[duty]] and rights [[right]] of [[man]] extend for it only
as far as its own altars. of this [[kind]] were all the religions [[religion]] of early
peoples, which we may define as civil or positive [[divine]] [[right]] or [[law]].

there is a third sort of [[religion]] of a more singular [[kind]], which gives
men two codes of legislation, two rulers, and two countries [[country]], renders
them [[subject]] to contradictory duties [[duty]], and makes it impossible for
them to be faithful both to [[religion]] and to citizenship. such are
the religions [[religion]] of the lamas and of the japanese, and such is roman
christianity, which may be called the [[religion]] of the [[priest]]. it leads
to a sort of mixed and anti-social code which has no name.

in their [[political]] aspect, all these three kinds [[kind]] of [[religion]] have their
defects. the third is so clearly [[bad]], that it is waste of [[time]] to stop
to prove it such. all that destroys social unity is worthless; all
institutions that set [[man]] in contradiction to himself are worthless.

the second is [[good]] in that it unites the [[divine]] cult with [[love]] of
the laws [[law]], and, making [[country]] the object of the citizens' adoration,
teaches them that service done to the [[state]] is service done to its
tutelary [[god]]. it is a form of theocracy, in which there can be no
pontiff save the [[prince]], and no priests [[priest]] save the magistrates. to die
for one's [[country]] then becomes martyrdom; violation of its laws [[law]],
impiety; and to [[subject]] one who is guilty to [[public]] execration is to
condemn him to the anger of the gods: _sacer estod_.

on the other hand, it is [[bad]] in that, being founded on lies [[lie]] and error,
it deceives [[men]], makes them credulous and [[superstitious]], and drowns the
true cult of the divinity in empty ceremonial. it is [[bad]], again, when
it becomes tyrannous and exclusive, and makes a [[people]] bloodthirsty and
intolerant, so that it breathes [[fire]] and slaughter, and regards as a
sacred act the killing of every one who does not [[believe]] in its gods.
the result is to place such a [[people]] in a [[natural]] [[state]] of [[war]] with all
others, so that its security is deeply endangered.

there remains therefore the [[religion]] of [[man]] or christianity--not the
christianity of to-day, but that of the gospel, which is entirely
different. by means of this holy, sublime, and real [[religion]] all [[men]],
being [[children]] of one [[god]], recognise one another as brothers [[brother]], and the
society that unites them is not dissolved even at [[death]].

but this [[religion]], having no particular relation to the [[body]] [[politic]],
leaves the laws [[law]] in possession of the [[force]] they have in themselves
without making any addition to it; and thus one of the [[great]] bonds that
unite [[society]] considered in severalty fails to operate. nay, more, so
far from binding the hearts [[heart]] of the [[citizens]] to the [[state]], it has the
effect of taking them away from all earthly things. i [[know]] of nothing
more contrary to the social spirit.

we are told that a [[people]] of true christians [[christian]] would form the most
perfect [[society]] imaginable. i see in this supposition only one great
difficulty: that a [[society]] of true christians [[christian]] would not be a [[society]] of
men.

i say further that such a [[society]], with all its [[perfection]], would be
neither the strongest nor the most lasting: the very [[fact]] that it was
perfect would rob it of its bond of union; the flaw that would destroy
it would [[lie]] in its very [[perfection]].

every one would do his [[duty]]; the [[people]] would be law-abiding, the
rulers just and temperate; the magistrates upright and incorruptible;
the soldiers would scorn [[death]]; there would be neither vanity nor
luxury. so far, so [[good]]; but let us hear more.

christianity as a [[religion]] is entirely [[spiritual]], occupied solely with
heavenly things; the [[country]] of the [[christian]] is not of this [[world]]. he
does his [[duty]], indeed, but does it with profound indifference to the
good or ill [[success]] of his cares [[care]]. provided he has nothing to reproach
himself with, it matters little to him whether things go well or ill
here on [[earth]]. if the [[state]] is prosperous, he hardly dares to share
in the [[public]] [[happiness]], for [[fear]] he may grow proud of his country's
glory; if the [[state]] is languishing, he blesses the hand of [[god]] that is
hard upon his [[people]].

for the [[state]] to be peaceable and for harmony to be maintained, all the
citizens without exception would have to be [[good]] christians [[christian]]; if by ill
hap there should be a [[single]] self-seeker or hypocrite, a catiline or a
cromwell, for instance, he would certainly get the [[better]] of his pious
compatriots. [[christian]] charity does not readily allow a [[man]] to think
hardly of his neighbours. as soon as, by some trick, he has discovered
the art [[arts]] of imposing on them and getting hold of a share in the public
authority, you have a [[man]] established in [[dignity]]; it is the will of
god that he be respected: very soon you have a [[power]]; it is god's will
that it be obeyed: and if the [[power]] is abused by him who wields it,
it is the scourge wherewith [[god]] punishes his [[children]]. there would be
scruples about driving out the usurper: [[public]] tranquillity would have
to be disturbed, [[violence]] would have to be employed, and [[blood]] spilt;
all this accords ill with [[christian]] meekness; and after all, in this
vale of sorrows [[sorrow]], what does it matter whether we are [[free]] [[men]] or serfs?
the essential thing is to get to [[heaven]], and resignation is only an
additional means of doing so.

if [[war]] breaks out with another [[state]], the [[citizens]] march readily out
to [[battle]]; not one of them thinks [[think]] of flight; they do their [[duty]], but
they have no passion for [[victory]]; they [[know]] [[better]] how to [[die]] than
how to conquer. what does it matter whether they [[win]] or lose? does
not providence [[know]] [[better]] than they what is meet for them? only
think to what account a proud, impetuous and passionate [[enemy]] could
turn their stoicism! set over against them those generous peoples [[people]] who
were devoured by ardent [[love]] of [[glory]] and of their [[country]], imagine
your [[christian]] [[republic]] face to face with sparta or [[rome]]: the pious
christians will be beaten, crushed and destroyed, before they know
where they are, or will owe their safety only to the contempt their
enemy will conceive for them. it was to my [[mind]] a fine oath that was
taken by the soldiers of fabius, who swore, not to conquer or [[die]], but
to come back victorious--and kept their oath. christians [[christian]], would never
have taken such an oath; they would have looked on it as tempting [[god]].

but i am mistaken in speaking of a [[christian]] [[republic]]; the terms
are mutually exclusive. [[christianity]] preaches only servitude and
dependence. its spirit is so favourable to [[tyranny]] that it always
profits by such a _régime_. true christians [[christian]] are made to be slaves [[slave]],
and they [[know]] it and do not much [[mind]]: this short [[life]] counts for too
little in their [[eyes]].

i shall be told that [[christian]] [[troops]] are excellent. i deny it. show
me an instance. for my part, i [[know]] of no [[christian]] [[troops]]. i shall be
told of the crusades. without disputing the valour of the crusaders,
i [[answer]] that, so far from being christians [[christian]], they were the priests'
soldiery, [[citizens]] of the [[church]]. they fought for their spiritual
country, which the [[church]] had, somehow or other, made temporal. well
understood, this goes back to paganism: as the gospel sets up no
national [[religion]], a holy [[war]] is impossible among christians [[christian]].

under the pagan emperors [[emperor]], the [[christian]] soldiers were brave; every
christian writer affirms it, and i [[believe]] it: it was a case of
honourable emulation of the pagan [[troops]]. as soon as the emperors [[emperor]] were
christian, this emulation no longer existed, and, when the cross had
driven out the eagle, roman valour wholly disappeared.

but, setting aside [[political]] considerations, let us come back to what
is [[right]], and settle our principles [[principle]] on this important point. the right
which the social compact gives the [[sovereign]] over the subjects [[subject]] does
not, we have seen, exceed the limits of [[public]] expediency.[5] the
subjects then owe the [[sovereign]] an account of their opinions [[opinion]] only to
such an extent as they matter to the [[community]]. now, it matters very
much to the [[community]] that each citizen should have a [[religion]]. that
will make him [[love]] his [[duty]]; but the dogmas of that [[religion]] concern
the [[state]] and its members only so far as they have reference to
morality and to the duties [[duty]] which he who professes them is bound to do
to others. each [[man]] may have, over and above, what opinions [[opinion]] he pleases,
without it being the sovereign's [[business]] to take cognisance of them;
for, as the [[sovereign]] has no [[authority]] in the other [[world]], whatever
the lot of its subjects [[subject]] may be in the [[life]] to come, that is not its
business, provided they are [[good]] [[citizens]] in this [[life]].

there is therefore a purely civil profession of [[faith]] of which the
sovereign should fix the articles, not exactly as [[religious]] dogmas, but
as social sentiments without which a [[man]] cannot be a [[good]] citizen or
a faithful [[subject]].[6] while it can compel no one to [[believe]] them, it
can banish from the [[state]] whoever does not [[believe]] them--it can banish
him, not for impiety, but as an anti-social being, incapable of truly
loving the laws [[law]] and [[justice]], and of sacrificing, at need, his [[life]] to
his [[duty]]. if any one, after publicly recognising these dogmas, behaves
as if he does not [[believe]] them, let him be punished by [[death]]: he has
committed the worst of all crimes, that of lying before the [[law]].

the dogmas of civil [[religion]] ought to be few, simple, and exactly
worded, without explanation or commentary. the existence of a mighty,
intelligent and beneficent divinity, possessed of foresight and
providence, the [[life]] to come, the [[happiness]] of the just, the punishment
of the wicked, the [[sanctity]] of the social contract and the laws [[law]]:
these are its positive dogmas. its negative dogmas i confine to one,
intolerance, which is a part of the cults we have rejected.

those who distinguish civil from theological intolerance are, to my
mind, mistaken. the two forms are inseparable. it is impossible to
live at [[peace]] with those we regard as damned; to [[love]] them would be
to hate [[god]] who punishes them: we positively must either reclaim or
torment them. wherever theological intolerance is admitted, it must
inevitably have some civil effect;[7] and as soon as it has such an
effect, the [[sovereign]] is no longer [[sovereign]] even in the temporal
sphere: thenceforth priests [[priest]] are the real masters, and kings [[king]] only their
ministers.

now that there is and can be no longer an exclusive national [[religion]],
tolerance should be given to all religions [[religion]] that tolerate others,
so long as their dogmas contain nothing contrary to the duties [[duty]] of
citizenship. but whoever dares to say: _outside the [[church]] is no
salvation,_ ought to be driven from the [[state]], unless the [[state]] is the
church, and the [[prince]] the pontiff. such a dogma is [[good]] only in a
theocratic [[government]]; in any other, it is fatal. the [[reason]] for which
henry iv is said to have embraced the roman [[religion]] ought to make
every honest [[man]] leave it, and still more any [[prince]] who knows [[know]] how to
reason.


[1] nonne ea quæ possidet chamos deus tuus, tibi jure debentur?
(judges xi. 24). such is the text in the vulgate. [[father]] de carrières
translates: "do you not regard yourselves as having a [[right]] to what
your [[god]] possesses?" i do not [[know]] the [[force]] of the [[hebrew]] text: but
i perceive that, in the vulgate, jephthah positively recognises the
right of the [[god]] chamos, and that the french translator weakened this
admission by inserting an "according to you," which is not in the latin.

[2] it is quite clear that the phocian [[war]], which was called "the
sacred [[war]]," was not a [[war]] of [[religion]]. its object was the punishment
of acts of sacrilege, and not the [[conquest]] of unbelievers.

[3] it should be noted that the clergy find their bond of union not so
much in formal assemblies, as in the communion of churches [[church]]. communion
and ex-communication are the social compact of the clergy, a compact
which will always make them masters of peoples [[people]] and kings [[king]]. all priests
who communicate together are fellow-citizens, even if they come
from opposite ends of the [[earth]]. this invention is a masterpiece of
statesmanship: there is nothing like it among pagan priests [[priest]]; who have
therefore never formed a clerical corporate [[body]].

[4] see, for instance, in a letter from grotius to his [[brother]] (april
11, 1643), what that learned [[man]] found to [[praise]] and to blame in the
_de cive._ it is true that, with a bent for indulgence, he seems to
pardon the writer the [[good]] for the sake of the [[bad]]; but all [[men]] are not
so forgiving.

[5] "in the [[republic]]," says the marquis d'argenson, "each [[man]] is
perfectly [[free]] in what does not harm others." this is the invariable
limitation, which it is impossible to define more exactly. i have not
been able to deny myself the [[pleasure]] of occasionally quoting from this
manuscript, though it is unknown to the [[public]], in order to do honour
to the memory of a [[good]] and illustrious [[man]], who had kept even in the
ministry the [[heart]] of a [[good]] citizen, and views on the [[government]] of
his [[country]] that were sane and [[right]].

[6] cæsar, pleading for catiline, tried to establish the dogma that the
soul is mortal: cato and cicero, in refutation, did not waste [[time]] in
philosophising. they were content to show that cæsar spoke like a bad
citizen, and brought forward a doctrine that would have a [[bad]] effect on
the [[state]]. this, in [[fact]], and not a problem of theology, was what the
roman senate had to [[judge]].

[7] [[marriage]], for instance, being a civil contract, has civil effects
without which [[society]] cannot even subsist suppose a [[body]] of clergy
should claim the sole [[right]] of permitting this act, a [[right]] which every
intolerant [[religion]] must of necessity claim, is it not clear that in
establishing the [[authority]] of the [[church]] in this [[respect]], it will be
destroying that of the [[prince]], who will have thenceforth only as many
subjects as the clergy choose to allow him? being in a position to
marry or not to [[marry]] [[people]], according to their acceptance of such
and such a doctrine, their admission or rejection of such and such a
formula, their greater or less piety, the [[church]] alone, by the exercise
of prudence and firmness, will dispose of all inheritances, offices
and [[citizens]], and even of the [[state]] itself, which could not subsist
if it were composed entirely of bastards? but, i shall be told, there
will be appeals on the ground of [[abuse]], summonses and decrees; the
temporalities will be seized. how sad! the clergy, however little, i
will not say [[courage]], but sense it has, will take no notice and go its
way: it will quietly allow appeals, summonses, decrees and seizures,
and, in the end, will remain the master. it is not, i [[think]], a great
sacrifice to give up a part, when one is sure of securing all.




chapter ix

conclusion

now that i have laid down the true principles [[principle]] of [[political]] [[right]], and
tried to give the [[state]] a basis of its own to rest on, i ought next
to strengthen it by its external relations, which would include the
law of nations, commerce, the [[right]] of [[war]] and [[conquest]], [[public]] [[right]],
leagues, negotiations, treaties, etc. but all this forms a new subject
that is far too vast for my narrow scope. i ought throughout to have
kept to a more limited sphere.




a discourse

which won the prize at the academy of dijon in 1750, on this question
proposed by the academy:

has the restoration of the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] had a purifying effect
upon morals [[moral]]?

barbaras his ego sum, qui non intelligor illis.--ovid.[1]

[1] here i am, a barbarian, because [[men]] [[understand]] me not.




preface


the following pages contain a discussion of one of the most sublime
and interesting of all [[moral]] questions [[question]]. it is not concerned, however,
with those metaphysical subtleties, which of late have found their way
into every department of literature, and from which even our academic
curricula are not always [[free]]. we have now to do with one of those
truths on which the [[happiness]] of [[mankind]] depends.

i foresee that i shall not readily be forgiven for having taken up the
position i have adopted. setting myself up against all that is nowadays
most admired, i can expect no less than a universal outcry against me:
nor is the approbation of a few sensible [[men]] enough to make me count
on that of the [[public]]. but i have taken my stand, and i shall be at no
pains to please either intellectuals or [[men]] of the [[world]]. there are in
all ages [[age]] [[men]] born to be in bondage to the opinions [[opinion]] of the [[society]] in
which they [[live]]. there are not a few, who to-day play the free-thinker
and the philosopher, who would, if they had lived in the [[time]] of the
league, have been no more than fanatics. no author, who has a [[mind]] to
outlive his own [[age]], should write for such readers.

a word more and i have done. as i did not expect the [[honour]] conferred
on me, i had, since sending in my discourse, so altered and enlarged
it as almost to make it a new [[work]]; but in the circumstances i have
felt bound to publish it just as it was when it received the prize. i
have only added a few notes, and left two alterations which are easily
recognisable, of which the academy possibly might not have approved.
the [[respect]], gratitude and even [[justice]] i owe to that [[body]] seemed to me
to demand this acknowledgment.




moral effects

of the [[arts]] and sciences

_decipimur specie recti_.--horace.


the [[question]] before me is, "whether the restoration of the [[arts]] and
sciences has had the effect of purifying or corrupting morals [[moral]]." which
side am i to take? that, gentlemen, which becomes an honest [[man]], who is
sensible of his own ignorance, and thinks [[think]] himself none the worse for it.

i [[feel]] the difficulty of treating this [[subject]] fittingly, before the
tribunal which is to [[judge]] of what i advance. how can i presume to
belittle the sciences [[science]] before one of the most learned assemblies in
europe, to commend ignorance in a famous academy, and reconcile my
contempt for study with the [[respect]] due to the truly learned?

i was aware of these inconsistencies, but not discouraged by them. it
is not [[science]], i said to myself, that i am attacking; it is virtue
that i am defending, and that before [[virtuous]] men--and goodness is even
dearer to the [[good]] than learning to the learned.

what then have i to [[fear]]? the sagacity of the assembly before which
i am pleading? that, i acknowledge, is to be feared; but rather on
account of faults [[fault]] of construction than of the views i hold. just
sovereigns have never hesitated to decide against themselves in
doubtful cases; and indeed the most advantageous situation in which a
just claim can be, is that of being laid before a just and enlightened
arbitrator, who is [[judge]] in his own case.

to this motive, which encouraged me, i may add another which finally
decided me. and this is, that as i have upheld the cause of [[truth]] to
the [[best]] of my [[natural]] abilities, whatever my apparent [[success]], there
is one [[reward]] which cannot fail me. that [[reward]] i shall find in the
bottom of my [[heart]].




the first part


it is a [[noble]] and beautiful spectacle to see [[man]] raising himself, so
to speak, from nothing by his own exertions; dissipating, by the light
of [[reason]], all the thick clouds in which he was by [[nature]] enveloped;
mounting above himself; soaring in [[thought]] even to the celestial
regions; like the sun, encompassing with giant strides the vast extent
of the [[universe]]; and, what is still grander and more wonderful, going
back into himself, there to study [[man]] and get to [[know]] his own [[nature]],
his duties [[duty]] and his end. all these [[miracles]] we have seen renewed within
the [[last]] few generations [[generation]].

europe had relapsed into the barbarism of the earliest ages [[age]]; the
inhabitants of this part of the [[world]], which is at [[present]] so highly
enlightened, were plunged, some centuries ago, in a [[state]] still-worse
than ignorance. a scientific jargon, more despicable than mere
ignorance, had usurped the name of [[knowledge]], and opposed an almost
invincible obstacle to its restoration.

things had come to such a pass, that it required a complete revolution
to bring [[men]] back to [[common]] sense. this came at [[last]] from the quarter
from which it was least to be expected. it was the stupid mussulman,
the eternal scourge of letters, who was the immediate cause of their
revival among us. the fall of the [[throne]] of constantine brought to
italy the relics of ancient greece; and with these precious spoils
france in turn was enriched. the sciences [[science]] soon followed literature,
and the art [[arts]] of thinking joined that of writing: an order which may
seem [[strange]], but is perhaps only too [[natural]]. the [[world]] now began to
perceive the principal advantage of an intercourse with the muses, that
of rendering [[mankind]] more sociable by inspiring them with the [[desire]] to
please one another with performances worthy of their mutual approbation.

the [[mind]], as well as the [[body]], has its needs: those of the [[body]] are the
basis of [[society]], those of the [[mind]] its ornaments.

so long as [[government]] and [[law]] provide for the security and well-being
of [[men]] in their [[common]] [[life]], the [[arts]], literature and the sciences [[science]],
less despotic though perhaps more powerful, fling garlands of flowers
over the chains which weigh them down. they stifle in men's breasts
that sense of original [[liberty]], for which they seem to have been born;
cause them to [[love]] their own [[slavery]], and so make of them what is
called a civilised [[people]].

necessity raised up thrones; the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] have made them
strong. powers [[power]] of the [[earth]], cherish all [[talents]] and [[protect]] those who
cultivate them.[1] civilised peoples [[people]], cultivate such pursuits: to them,
happy slaves [[slave]], you owe that delicacy and exquisiteness of taste, which
is so much your boast, that sweetness of disposition and urbanity of
manners which make intercourse so easy and agreeable among you--in a
word, the appearance of all the virtues [[virtue]], without being in possession of
one of them.

it was for this sort of accomplishment, which is by so much the more
captivating as it seems less affected, that [[athens]] and [[rome]] were
so much distinguished in the boasted times [[time]] of their splendour and
magnificence: and it is doubtless in the same [[respect]] that our own age
and nation will excel all periods and peoples [[people]]. an air of philosophy
without pedantry; an address at once [[natural]] and engaging, distant
equally from teutonic clumsiness and italian pantomime; these are
the effects of a taste acquired by liberal studies and improved by
conversation with the [[world]]. what [[happiness]] would it be for those who
live among us, if our external appearance were always a true mirror of
our hearts [[heart]]; if decorum were but [[virtue]]; if the maxims [[maxim]] we professed were
the rules [[rule]] of our conduct; and if real [[philosophy]] were inseparable from
the title of a philosopher! but so many [[good]] qualities too seldom go
together; [[virtue]] rarely appears in so much pomp and [[state]].

richness of apparel may proclaim the [[man]] of [[fortune]], and elegance the
man of taste; but true health and manliness are known by different
signs. it is under the home-spun of the labourer, and not beneath the
gilt and tinsel of the courtier, that we should look for [[strength]] and
vigour of [[body]].

external ornaments are no less [[foreign]] to [[virtue]], which is the strength
and activity of the [[mind]]. the honest [[man]] is an athlete, who loves [[love]] to
wrestle stark naked; he scorns all those vile trappings, which prevent
the exertion of his [[strength]], and were, for the most part, invented
only to conceal some deformity.

before art [[arts]] had moulded our behaviour, and taught our [[passions]] to speak
an artificial [[language]], our morals [[moral]] were rude but [[natural]]; and the
different ways in which we behaved proclaimed at the first glance the
difference of our dispositions. [[human]] [[nature]] was not at bottom better
then than now; but [[men]] found their security in the ease with which
they could see through one another, and this advantage, of which we no
longer [[feel]] the value, prevented their having many vices [[vice]].

in our day, now that more subtle study and a more refined taste have
reduced the art [[arts]] of pleasing to a [[system]], there prevails in modern
manners a servile and deceptive conformity; so that one would think
every [[mind]] had been cast in the same mould. politeness requires this
thing; decorum that; [[ceremony]] has its forms, and [[fashion]] its laws [[law]], and
these we must always [[follow]], never the promptings of our own [[nature]].

we no longer dare seem what we really are, but [[lie]] under a perpetual
restraint; in the meantime the herd of [[men]], which we call [[society]], all
act under the same circumstances exactly alike, unless very particular
and powerful motives prevent them. thus we never [[know]] with whom we have
to deal; and even to [[know]] our [[friends]] we must wait for some critical
and pressing [[occasion]]; that is, till it is too late; for it is on those
very occasions [[occasion]] that such [[knowledge]] is of use to us.

what a train of vices [[vice]] must attend this uncertainty! sincere
friendship, real esteem, and [[perfect]] confidence are [[banished]] from
among [[men]]. [[jealousy]], suspicion, [[fear]], coldness, reserve, hate and
fraud [[lie]] constantly concealed under that uniform and deceitful veil
of politeness; that boasted candour and urbanity, for which we are
indebted to the [[light]] and leading of this [[age]]. we shall no longer take
in [[vain]] by our oaths the name of our creator; but we shall insult him
with our blasphemies, and our scrupulous ears will take no offence.
we have grown too modest to brag of our own deserts; but we do not
scruple to decry those of others. we do not grossly outrage even our
enemies, but artfully calumniate them. our [[hatred]] of other nations
diminishes, but [[patriotism]] dies with it. ignorance is held in contempt;
but a dangerous scepticism has succeeded it. some vices [[vice]] indeed are
condemned and others grown dishonourable; but we have still many that
are honoured with the names of virtues [[virtue]], and it is become necessary
that we should either have, or at least pretend to have them. let who
will extol the moderation of our [[modern]] sages, i see nothing in it but
a refinement of intemperance as unworthy of my commendation as their
artificial simplicity.[2]

such is the purity to which our morals [[moral]] have attained; this is the
virtue we have made our own. let the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] claim the share
they have had in this salutary [[work]]. i shall add but one reflection
more; suppose an inhabitant of some distant [[country]] should endeavour
to form an [[idea]] of [[european]] morals [[moral]] from the [[state]] of the sciences [[science]], the
perfection of the [[arts]], the propriety of our [[public]] entertainments,
the politeness of our behaviour, the affability of our conversation,
our constant professions of benevolence, and from those tumultuous
assemblies of [[people]] of all ranks, who seem, from morning till night,
to have no other [[care]] than to oblige one another. such a stranger, i
maintain, would arrive at a totally false view of our morality.

where there is no effect, it is idle to look for a cause: but here
the effect is [[certain]] and the depravity actual; our minds [[mind]] have been
corrupted in proportion as the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] have improved. will
it be said, that this is a misfortune peculiar to the [[present]] [[age]]? no,
gentlemen, the evils [[evil]] resulting from our [[vain]] curiosity are as old as
the [[world]]. the daily ebb and flow of the tides are not more regularly
influenced by the moon, than the morals [[moral]] of a [[people]] by the progress
of the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]]. as their [[light]] has risen above our horizon,
virtue has taken flight, and the same phenomenon has been constantly
observed in all times [[time]] and places.

take [[egypt]], the first school of [[mankind]], that ancient [[country]], famous
for its fertility under a brazen [[sky]]; the spot from which sesostris
once set out to conquer the [[world]]. [[egypt]] became the [[mother]] of
philosophy and the fine [[arts]]; soon she was conquered by cambyses, and
then successively by the greeks [[greek]], the romans, the arabs, and finally the
turks.

take greece, once peopled by heroes, who twice vanquished [[asia]].
letters, as yet in their infancy, had not corrupted the disposition
of its inhabitants; but the [[progress]] of the sciences [[science]] soon produced a
dissoluteness of manners, and the imposition of the macedonian yoke:
from which [[time]] greece, always learned, always voluptuous and always a
slave, has experienced amid all its revolutions [[revolution]] no more than a change
of masters. not all the eloquence of demosthenes could breathe life
into a [[body]] which luxury and the [[arts]] had once enervated.

it was not till the days of ennius and terence that [[rome]], founded by
a shepherd, and made illustrious by i peasants, began to degenerate.
but after the appearance of an ovid, a catullus, a martial, and the
rest of those numerous obscene authors, whose very names are enough to
put modesty to the blush, [[rome]], once the shrine of [[virtue]], became the
theatre of [[vice]], a scorn among the nations, and an object of derision
even to barbarians. thus the [[capital]] of the [[world]] at length submitted
to the yoke of [[slavery]] it had imposed on others, and the very day
of its fall was the eve of that on which it conferred on one of its
citizens the title of arbiter of [[good]] taste.

what shall i say of that metropolis of the eastern [[empire]], which, by
its situation, seemed destined to be the [[capital]] of the [[world]]; that
refuge of the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]], when they were [[banished]] from the rest
of [[europe]], more perhaps by [[wisdom]] than barbarism? the most profligate
debaucheries, the most abandoned villainies, the most atrocious crimes,
plots, murders and assassinations form the warp and woof of the
history of constantinople. such is the pure source from which have
flowed to us the floods of [[knowledge]] on which the [[present]] [[age]] so prides
itself.

but wherefore should we seek, in [[past]] ages [[age]], for proofs of a [[truth]], of
which the [[present]] affords us ample evidence? there is in [[asia]] a vast
empire, where learning is held in [[honour]], and leads to the highest
dignities in the [[state]]. if the sciences [[science]] improved our morals [[moral]], if they
inspired us with [[courage]] and taught us to lay down our lives [[life]] for the
good of our [[country]], the chinese should be [[wise]], [[free]] and invincible.
but, if there be no [[vice]] they do not practise, no crime with which they
are not familiar; if the sagacity of their ministers, the supposed
wisdom of their laws [[law]], and the multitude of inhabitants who [[people]] that
vast [[empire]], have alike failed to preserve them from the yoke of the
rude and ignorant tartars, of what use were their [[men]] of [[science]] and
literature? what advantage has that [[country]] reaped from the honours
bestowed on its learned [[men]]? can it be that of being peopled by a race
of scoundrels and slaves [[slave]]?

contrast with these instances the morals [[moral]] of those few nations which,
being preserved from the contagion of useless [[knowledge]], have by
their virtues [[virtue]] become [[happy]] in themselves and afforded an [[example]] to
the rest of the [[world]]. such were the first inhabitants of [[persia]],
a nation so singular that [[virtue]] was taught among them in the same
manner as the sciences [[science]] are with us. they very easily subdued [[asia]],
and possess the exclusive [[glory]] of having had the [[history]] of their
political [[institutions]] regarded as a philosophical romance. such were
the scythians, of whom such wonderful eulogies have come down to us.
such were the germans, whose simplicity, innocence and [[virtue]], afforded
a most delightful contrast to the pen of an historian, weary of
describing the baseness and villainies of an enlightened, opulent and
voluptuous nation. such had been even [[rome]] in the days of its poverty
and ignorance. and such has shown itself to be, even in our own times [[time]],
that rustic nation, whose justly renowned [[courage]] not even adversity
could conquer, and whose fidelity no [[example]] could [[corrupt]].[3]

it is not through stupidity that the [[people]] have preferred other
activities to those of the [[mind]]. they were not ignorant that in other
countries there were [[men]] who spent their [[time]] in disputing idly about
the [[sovereign]] [[good]], and about [[vice]] and [[virtue]]. they knew that these
useless thinkers were lavish in their own praises [[praise]], and stigmatised
other nations contemptuously as barbarians. but they noted the morals
of these [[people]], and so learnt what to [[think]] of their learning.[4]

can it be forgotten that, in the very [[heart]] of greece, there arose
a [[city]] as famous for the [[happy]] ignorance of its inhabitants, as for
the [[wisdom]] of its laws [[law]]; a [[republic]] of demi-gods rather than of [[men]],
so greatly superior their virtues [[virtue]] seemed to those of mere [[humanity]]?
sparta, eternal proof of the vanity of [[science]], while the vices [[vice]], under
the conduct of the fine [[arts]], were being introduced into [[athens]], even
while its [[tyrant]] was carefully collecting together the works [[work]] of the
prince of poets, was driving from her walls artists and the [[arts]], the
learned and their learning!

the difference was seen in the outcome. [[athens]] became the seat of
politeness and taste, the [[country]] of orators and [[philosophers]]. the
elegance of its buildings equalled that of its [[language]]; on every side
might be seen marble and canvas, animated by the hands of the most
skilful artists. from [[athens]] we derive those astonishing performances,
which will serve as models to every [[corrupt]] [[age]]. the picture of
lacedæmon is not so highly coloured. there, the neighbouring nations
used to say, "men were born [[virtuous]], their native air seeming to
inspire them with [[virtue]]." but its inhabitants have left us nothing but
the memory of their heroic actions: monuments that should not count for
less in our [[eyes]] than the most [[curious]] relics of athenian marble.

it is true that, among the athenians, there were some few [[wise]] [[men]] who
withstood the general torrent, and preserved their integrity even in
the company of the muses. but hear the [[judgment]] which the principal,
and most unhappy of them, passed on the artists and learned [[men]] of his
day.

"i have considered the poets," says he, "and i look upon them as people
whose [[talents]] impose both on themselves and on others; they give
themselves out for [[wise]] [[men]], and are taken for such; but in reality
they are anything sooner than that."

"from the poets," continues [[socrates]], "i turned to the artists. nobody
was more ignorant of the [[arts]] than myself; nobody was more fully
persuaded that the artists were possessed of amazing [[knowledge]]. i soon
discovered, however, that they were in as [[bad]] a way as the poets, and
that both had fallen into the same misconception. because the most
skilful of them excel others in their particular jobs, they think
themselves wiser than all the rest of [[mankind]]. this arrogance spoilt
all their [[skill]] in my [[eyes]], so that, putting myself in the place of
the oracle, and asking myself whether i would rather be what i am or
what they are, [[know]] what they [[know]], or [[know]] that i [[know]] nothing, i very
readily answered, for myself and the [[god]], that i had rather remain as i
am.

"none of us, neither the sophists, nor the poets, nor the orators, nor
the artists, nor i, [[know]] what is the [[nature]] of the _true_, the _good_,
or the _beautiful_. but there is this difference between us; that,
though none of these [[people]] [[know]] anything, they all [[think]] they know
something; whereas for my part, if i [[know]] nothing, i am at least in no
doubt of my ignorance. so the superiority of [[wisdom]], imputed to me by
the oracle, is reduced merely to my being fully convinced that i am
ignorant of what i do not [[know]]."

thus we find [[socrates]], the wisest of [[men]] in the [[judgment]] of the [[god]],
and the most learned of all the athenians in the [[opinion]] of all greece,
speaking in [[praise]] of ignorance. were he alive now, there is little
reason to [[think]] that our [[modern]] scholars and artists would induce him
to [[change]] his [[mind]]. no, gentlemen, that honest [[man]] would still persist
in despising our [[vain]] sciences [[science]]. he would lend no aid to swell the flood
of books [[book]] that flows from every quarter: he would leave to us, as he did
to his disciples, only the [[example]] and memory of his virtues [[virtue]]; that is
the noblest method of instructing [[mankind]].

socrates had begun at [[athens]], and the elder cato proceeded at [[rome]], to
inveigh against those seductive and subtle greeks [[greek]], who corrupted the
virtue and destroyed the [[courage]] of their fellow-citizens: [[culture]],
however, prevailed. [[rome]] was filled with [[philosophers]] and orators,
military discipline was neglected, agriculture was held in contempt,
men formed sects, and forgot their [[country]]. to the [[sacred]] names of
liberty, disinterestedness and [[obedience]] to [[law]], succeeded those of
epicurus, zeno and arcesilaus. it was even a saying among their own
philosophers that since learned [[men]] appeared among them, honest [[men]] had
been in eclipse. before that [[time]] the romans were satisfied with the
practice of [[virtue]]; they were undone when they began to study it.

what would the [[great]] [[soul]] of fabricius have [[felt]], if it had been
his misfortune to be called back to [[life]], when he saw the pomp and
magnificence of that [[rome]], which his arm had saved from ruin, and
his honourable name made more illustrious than all its conquests.
"ye gods!" he would have said, "what has become of those thatched
roofs and rustic hearths, which were formerly the habitations of
temperance and [[virtue]]? what fatal splendour has succeeded the ancient
roman simplicity? what is this [[foreign]] [[language]], this effeminacy of
manners? what is the meaning of these statues, paintings and buildings?
fools, what have you done? you, the lords [[lord]] of the [[earth]], have made
yourselves the slaves [[slave]] of the frivolous nations you have subdued.
you are governed by rhetoricians, and it has been only to enrich
architects, painters, sculptors and stage-players that you have watered
greece and [[asia]] with your [[blood]]. even the spoils of [[carthage]] are the
prize of a flute-player. romans! romans! make haste to demolish those
amphitheatres, break to pieces those statues, burn those paintings;
drive from among you those slaves [[slave]] who keep you in subjection, and whose
fatal [[arts]] are corrupting your morals [[moral]]. let other hands make themselves
illustrious by such [[vain]] [[talents]]; the only talent worthy of [[rome]] is
that of conquering the [[world]] and making [[virtue]] its ruler. when cyneas
took the roman senate for an assembly of kings [[king]], he was not struck by
either useless pomp or [[studied]] elegance. he heard there none of that
futile eloquence, which is now the study and the charm of frivolous
orators. what then was the majesty that cyneas beheld? fellow [[citizens]],
he saw the noblest sight that ever existed under [[heaven]], a sight which
not all your riches [[rich]] or your [[arts]] can show; an assembly of two hundred
virtuous [[men]], worthy to command in [[rome]], and to govern the [[world]]."

but let pass the distance of [[time]] and place, and let us see what has
happened in our own [[time]] and [[country]]; or rather let us banish odious
descriptions that might offend our delicacy, and spare ourselves the
pains of repeating the same tilings under different names. it was not
for nothing that i invoked the manes of fabricius; for what have i
put into his mouth, that might not have come with as much propriety
from louis the twelfth or henry the fourth? it is true that in france
socrates would not have drunk the hemlock, but he would have drunk of
a potion infinitely more bitter, of insult, mockery and contempt a
hundred times [[time]] worse than [[death]].

thus it is that luxury, profligacy and [[slavery]], have been, in all ages [[age]],
the scourge of the efforts of our [[pride]] to emerge from that happy
state of ignorance, in which the [[wisdom]] of providence had placed us.
that thick veil with which it has covered all its operations seems to
be a sufficient proof that it never designed us for such fruitless
researches. but is there, indeed, one lesson it has taught us, by which
we have rightly profited, or which we have neglected with impunity? let
men learn for once that [[nature]] would have preserved them from [[science]],
as a [[mother]] snatches a dangerous weapon from the hands of her child.
let them [[know]] that all the secrets she hides are so many evils [[evil]] from
which she protects them, and that the very difficulty they find in
acquiring [[knowledge]] is not the least of her bounty towards them. men
are perverse; but they would have been far worse, if they had had the
misfortune to be born learned.

how humiliating are these reflections to [[humanity]], and how mortified
by them our [[pride]] should be! what! it will be [[asked]], is uprightness
the child of ignorance? is [[virtue]] inconsistent with learning? what
consequences might not be drawn from such suppositions? but to
reconcile these apparent contradictions, we need only examine closely
the emptiness and vanity of those pompous titles, which are so
liberally bestowed on [[human]] [[knowledge]], and which so blind our [[judgment]].
let us consider, therefore, the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] in themselves. let us
see what must result from their advancement, and let us not hesitate
to admit the [[truth]] of all those points on which our arguments coincide
with the inductions we can make from [[history]].


[1] sovereigns [[sovereign]] always see with, [[pleasure]] a taste for the [[arts]] of
amusement and superfluity, which do not result in the exportation of
bullion, increase among their subjects [[subject]]. they very well [[know]] that,
besides nourishing that littleness of [[mind]] which is proper to [[slavery]],
the increase of artificial wants only binds so many more chains upon
the [[people]]. alexander, wishing to keep the ichthyophages in a state
of dependence, compelled them to give up fishing, and subsist on the
customary food of civilised nations. the american savages, who go
naked, and [[live]] entirely on the products of the chase, have been always
impossible to subdue. what yoke, indeed, can be imposed on [[men]] who
stand in need of nothing?

[2] "i [[love]]," said montaigne, "to converse and hold an argument; but
only with very few [[people]], and that for my own gratification. for to do
so, by way of affording amusement for the [[great]], or of making a parade
of one's [[talents]], is, in my [[opinion]], a [[trade]] very ill-becoming a [[man]] of
honour." it is the [[trade]] of all our intellectuals, save one.

[3] i dare not speak of those [[happy]] nations, who did not even [[know]] the
name of many vices [[vice]], which we find it difficult to suppress; the savages
of [[america]], whose simple and [[natural]] mode of [[government]] montaigne
preferred, without hesitation, not only to the laws [[law]] of [[plato]], but to
the most [[perfect]] visions of [[government]] [[philosophy]] can ever suggest he
cites many examples [[example]], striking for those who are capable of appreciating
them. but, what of all that, says he, they can't run to a pair of
breeches!

[4] what are we to [[think]] was the real [[opinion]] of the athenians
themselves about eloquence, when they were so very careful to banish
declamation from that upright tribunal, against whose decision even
their gods made no appeal? what did the romans [[think]] of physicians,
when they expelled medicine from the [[republic]]? and when the relics of
humanity left among the spaniards induced them to forbid their lawyers
to set foot in [[america]], what must they have [[thought]] of jurisprudence?
may it not be said that they [[thought]], by this [[single]] expedient, to make
reparation for all the outrages they had committed against the unhappy
indians?




the second part


an ancient tradition passed out of [[egypt]] into greece, that some [[god]],
who was an [[enemy]] to the repose of [[mankind]], was the inventor of the
sciences.[1] what must the [[egyptians]], among whom the sciences [[science]] first
arose, have [[thought]] of them? and they beheld, near at hand, the sources
from which they sprang. in [[fact]], whether we turn to the annals of the
world, or eke out with philosophical investigations the uncertain
chronicles of [[history]], we shall not find for [[human]] [[knowledge]] an origin
answering to the [[idea]] we are pleased to entertain of it at [[present]].
astronomy was born of superstition, eloquence of [[ambition]], [[hatred]],
falsehood and [[flattery]]; geometry of avarice; physics of an idle
curiosity; and even [[moral]] [[philosophy]] of [[human]] [[pride]]. thus the [[arts]] and
sciences owe their birth to our vices [[vice]]; we should be less doubtful of
their advantages, if they had sprung from our virtues [[virtue]].

their [[evil]] origin is, indeed, but too plainly reproduced in their
objects. what would become of the [[arts]], were they not cherished by
luxury? if [[men]] were not [[unjust]], of what use were jurisprudence?
what would become of [[history]], if there were no tyrants [[tyrant]], wars [[war]],
or conspiracies? in a word, who would pass his [[life]] in barren
speculations, if everybody, attentive only to the obligations of
humanity and the necessities of [[nature]], spent his whole [[life]] in serving
his [[country]], obliging his [[friends]], and relieving the unhappy? are we
then made to [[live]] and [[die]] on the brink of that well at the bottom of
which [[truth]] lies [[lie]] hid? this reflection alone is, in my [[opinion]], enough
to discourage at first setting out every [[man]] who seriously endeavours
to instruct himself by the study of [[philosophy]].

what a variety of dangers surrounds us! what a number of [[wrong]] paths
present themselves in the investigation of the sciences! through how
many errors, more perilous than [[truth]] itself is useful, must we not
pass to arrive at it? the disadvantages we [[lie]] under are evident; for
falsehood is capable of an infinite variety of combinations; but the
truth has only one manner of being. besides, where is the [[man]] who
sincerely desires [[desire]] to find it? or even admitting his [[good]] will, by
what characteristic marks is he sure of knowing it? amid the infinite
diversity of opinions [[opinion]] where is the criterion[2] by which we may
certainly [[judge]] of it? again, what is still more difficult, should we
even be fortunate enough to discover it, who among us will [[know]] how to
make [[right]] use of it?

if our sciences [[science]] are futile in the objects they propose, they are
no less dangerous in the effects they [[produce]]. being the effect of
idleness, they generate idleness in their turn; and an irreparable
loss of [[time]] is the first prejudice which they must necessarily cause
to [[society]]. to [[live]] without doing some [[good]] is a [[great]] [[evil]] as well in
the [[political]] as in the [[moral]] [[world]]; and hence every useless citizen
should be regarded as a pernicious [[person]]. tell me then, illustrious
philosophers, of whom we learn the ratios in which attraction acts in
vacuo; and in the [[revolution]] of the planets, the relations of spaces
traversed in [[equal]] times [[time]]; by whom we are taught what curves have
conjugate points, points of inflexion, and cusps; how the [[soul]] and body
correspond, like two clocks, without actual communication; what planets
may be inhabited; and what insects reproduce in an extraordinary
manner. [[answer]] me, i say, you from whom we receive all this sublime
information, whether we should have been less numerous, worse governed,
less formidable, less flourishing, or more perverse, supposing you had
taught us none of all these fine things.

reconsider therefore the importance of your productions; and, since
the labours [[labour]] of the most enlightened of our learned [[men]] and the [[best]] of
our [[citizens]] are of so little utility, tell us what we ought to think
of that numerous herd of obscure writers and useless litterateurs, who
devour without any return the substance of the [[state]].

useless, do i say? would [[god]] they were! [[society]] would be more peaceful,
and morals [[moral]] less [[corrupt]]. but these [[vain]] and futile declaimers go forth
on all sides, armed with their fatal paradoxes, to sap the foundations
of our [[faith]], and nullify [[virtue]]. they smile contemptuously at such
old names as [[patriotism]] and [[religion]], and consecrate their [[talents]] and
philosophy to the destruction; and defamation of all that [[men]] hold
sacred. not that they bear any real [[hatred]] to [[virtue]] or dogma; they are
the enemies [[enemy]] of [[public]] [[opinion]] alone; to bring them to the foot of the
altar, it would be enough to banish them to a [[land]] of atheists. what
extravagancies will not the rage of singularity induce [[men]] to commit!

the waste of [[time]] is certainly a [[great]] [[evil]]; but still greater evils
attend upon literature and the [[arts]]. one is luxury, produced like
them by indolence and vanity. luxury is seldom unattended by the arts
and sciences [[science]]; and they are always attended by luxury. i [[know]] that our
philosophy, fertile in paradoxes, pretends, in contradiction to the
experience of all ages [[age]], that luxury contributes to the splendour of
states. but, without insisting on the necessity of sumptuary laws [[law]], can
it be denied that rectitude of morals [[moral]] is essential to the duration of
empires, and that luxury is diametrically opposed to such rectitude?
let it be admitted that luxury is a [[certain]] indication of [[wealth]]; that
it even serves, if you will, to increase such [[wealth]]: what conclusion
is to be drawn from this paradox, so worthy of the times [[time]]? and what
will become of [[virtue]] if riches [[rich]] are to be acquired at any cost? the
politicians of the ancient [[world]] were always talking of morals [[moral]] and
virtue; ours speak of nothing but commerce and [[money]]. one of them will
tell you that in such a [[country]] a [[man]] is worth just as much as he will
sell for at algiers: another, pursuing the same mode of calculation,
finds that in some countries [[country]] a [[man]] is worth nothing, and in others
still less than nothing; they value [[men]] as they do droves of oxen.
according to them, a [[man]] is worth no more to the [[state]], than the
amount he consumes; and thus a sybarite would be worth at least thirty
lacedæmonians. let these writers tell me, however, which of the two
republics, sybaris or sparta, was subdued by a handful of peasants, and
which became the terror of [[asia]].

the [[monarchy]] of cyrus was conquered by thirty thousand [[men]], [[led]] by a
prince poorer than the meanest of persian satraps: in like manner the
scythians, the poorest of all nations, were able to resist the most
powerful monarchs of the [[universe]]. when two famous republics [[republic]] contended
for the [[empire]] of the [[world]], the one [[rich]] and the other [[poor]], the
former was subdued by the latter. the roman [[empire]] in its turn, after
having engulfed all the riches [[rich]] of the [[universe]], fell a prey to peoples
who knew not even what riches [[rich]] were. the franks conquered the gauls, and
the saxons [[england]], without any other treasures than their bravery and
their [[poverty]]. a band of [[poor]] mountaineers, whose whole cupidity was
confined to the possession of a few sheep-skins, having first given a
check to the arrogance of austria, went on to crush the opulent and
formidable house of burgundy, which at that [[time]] made the potentates
of [[europe]] tremble. in short, all the [[power]] and [[wisdom]] of the heir of
charles the fifth, backed by all the treasures of the indies, broke
before a few herring-fishers. let our politicians condescend to lay
aside their calculations for a moment, to reflect on these examples [[example]];
let them learn for once that [[money]], though it buys everything else,
cannot buy morals [[moral]] and [[citizens]]. what then is the precise point in
dispute about luxury? it is to [[know]] which is most advantageous to
empires, that their existence should be brilliant and momentary,
or [[virtuous]] and lasting? i say brilliant, but with what lustre! a
taste for ostentation never prevails in the same minds [[mind]] as a taste
for honesty. no, it is impossible that understandings, degraded by a
multitude of futile cares [[care]], should ever rise to what is truly [[great]] and
noble; even if they had the [[strength]], they would want the [[courage]].

every artist loves [[love]] applause. the [[praise]] of his contemporaries is the
most valuable part of his recompense. what then will he do to obtain
it, if he have the misfortune to be born among a [[people]], and at a
time, when learning is in vogue, and the superficiality of [[youth]] is
in a position to lead the [[fashion]]; when [[men]] have sacrificed their
taste to those who tyrannise over their [[liberty]], and one [[sex]] dare not
approve anything but what is proportionate to the pusillanimity of
the other;[3] when the [[greatest]] masterpieces of dramatic poetry are
condemned, and the noblest of musical productions neglected? this is
what he will do. he will lower his genius to the level of the [[age]], and
will rather submit to compose mediocre works [[work]], that will be admired
during his life-time, than [[labour]] at sublime achievements which will
not be admired till long after he is [[dead]]. let the famous voltaire tell
us how many nervous and masculine beauties [[beauty]] he has sacrificed to our
false delicacy, and how much that is [[great]] and [[noble]], that spirit of
gallantry, which delights in what is frivolous and petty, has cost him.

it is thus that the dissolution of morals [[moral]], the necessary consequence of
luxury, brings with it in its turn the [[corruption]] of taste. further, if
by [[chance]] there be found among [[men]] of average ability, an individual
with enough [[strength]] of [[mind]] to refuse to comply with the spirit of
the [[age]], and to debase himself by puerile productions, his lot will
be hard. he will [[die]] in indigence and oblivion. this is not so much a
prediction, as a [[fact]] already confirmed by experience! yes, carle and
pierre vanloo, the [[time]] is already come when your pencils, destined to
increase the majesty of our temples by sublime and holy images, must
fall from your hands, or else be prostituted to adorn the panels of a
coach with lascivious paintings. and you, inimitable pigal, rival of
phidias and praxiteles, whose chisel the ancients would have employed
to carve them gods, whose images almost excuse their idolatry in our
eyes; even your hand must condescend to [[fashion]] the belly of an ape, or
else remain idle.

we cannot reflect on the morality of [[mankind]] without contemplating with
pleasure the picture of the simplicity which prevailed in the earliest
times. this image may be justly compared to a beautiful coast, adorned
only by the hands of [[nature]]; towards which our [[eyes]] are constantly
turned, and which we see receding with regret. while [[men]] were innocent
and [[virtuous]] and loved to have the gods for witnesses of their actions,
they dwelt together in the same huts; but when they became vicious,
they grew tired of such inconvenient onlookers, and [[banished]] them to
magnificent temples. finally, they expelled their deities even from
these, in order to dwell there themselves; or at least the temples
of the gods were no longer more magnificent than the palaces of the
citizens. this was the height of degeneracy; nor could [[vice]] ever be
carried to greater lengths than when it was seen, supported, as it
were, at the doors of the [[great]], on columns of marble, and graven on
corinthian capitals.

as the conveniences of [[life]] increase, as the [[arts]] are brought to
perfection, and luxury spreads, true [[courage]] flags, the virtues
disappear; and all this is the effect of the sciences [[science]] and of those
arts which are exercised in the privacy of men's dwellings. when the
goths ravaged greece, the libraries only escaped the flames owing to an
opinion that was set on foot among them, that it was [[best]] to leave the
enemy with a possession so calculated to divert their attention from
military exercises, and keep them engaged in indolent and sedentary
occupations.

charles the eighth found himself master of tuscany and the [[kingdom]] of
naples, almost without drawing [[sword]]; and all his court attributed
this unexpected [[success]] to the [[fact]] that the princes [[prince]] and nobles [[noble]] of
italy applied themselves with greater earnestness to the cultivation
of their understandings than to active and martial pursuits. in [[fact]],
says the sensible [[person]] who records these characteristics, experience
plainly tells us, that in [[military]] matters and all that resemble them
application to the sciences [[science]] tends rather to make [[men]] effeminate and
cowardly than resolute and vigorous.

the romans confessed that [[military]] [[virtue]] was extinguished among them,
in proportion as they became connoisseurs in the [[arts]] of the painter,
the engraver and the goldsmith, and began to cultivate the fine [[arts]].
indeed, as if this famous [[country]] was to be for ever an [[example]] to
other nations, the rise of the medici and the revival of letters has
once more destroyed, this [[time]] perhaps for ever, the martial reputation
which [[italy]] seemed a few centuries ago to have recovered.

the ancient republics [[republic]] of greece, with that [[wisdom]] which was so
conspicuous in most of their [[institutions]], forbade their citizens
to pursue all those inactive and sedentary occupations, which by
enervating and corrupting the [[body]] diminish also the vigour of the
mind. with what [[courage]], in [[fact]], can it be [[thought]] that [[hunger]] and
thirst, fatigues, dangers and [[death]], can be faced by [[men]] whom the
smallest want overwhelms and the slightest difficulty repels? with what
resolution can soldiers support the excessive toils of [[war]], when they
are entirely unaccustomed to them? with what spirits can they make
forced marches under officers who have not even the [[strength]] to travel
on horseback? it is no [[answer]] to cite the reputed valour of all the
modern warriors who are so scientifically trained. i hear much of their
bravery in a day's [[battle]]; but i am told nothing of how they support
excessive fatigue, how they stand the severity of the seasons and the
inclemency of the weather. a little sunshine or snow, or the want
of a few superfluities, is enough to cripple and [[destroy]] one of our
finest armies [[army]] in a few days. intrepid warriors i permit me for once to
tell you the [[truth]], which you seldom hear. of your bravery i am fully
satisfied. i have no [[doubt]] that you would have triumphed with hannibal
at cannæ, and at trasimene: that you would have passed the rubicon
with cæsar, and enabled him to enslave his [[country]]; but you never would
have been able to cross the alps with the former, or with the latter to
subdue your own [[ancestors]], the gauls.

a [[war]] does not always depend on the events of [[battle]]: there is in
generalship an art [[arts]] superior to that of gaining victories [[victory]]. a [[man]] may
behave with [[great]] intrepidity under [[fire]], and yet be a very had
officer. even in the [[common]] soldier, a little more [[strength]] and vigour
would perhaps be more useful than so much [[courage]], which after all is
no protection from [[death]]. and what does it matter to the [[state]] whether
its [[troops]] perish by cold and fever, or by the [[sword]] of the [[enemy]]?

if the cultivation of the sciences [[science]] is prejudicial to military
qualities, it is still more so to [[moral]] qualities. even from our
infancy an absurd [[system]] of [[education]] serves to adorn our wit and
corrupt our [[judgment]]. we see, on every side, huge [[institutions]], where
our [[youth]] are educated at [[great]] expense, and instructed in everything
but their [[duty]]. your [[children]] will be ignorant of their own [[language]],
when they can talk others which are not spoken anywhere. they will be
able to compose verses which they can hardly [[understand]]; and, without
being capable of distinguishing [[truth]] from error, they will possess
the art [[arts]] of making them unrecognisable by specious arguments. but
magnanimity, equity, temperance, [[humanity]] and [[courage]] will be words of
which they [[know]] not the meaning. the dear name of [[country]] will never
strike on their ears; and if they ever hear speak of [[god]],[4] it will
be less to [[fear]], than to be frightened of him. i would as soon, said a
wise [[man]], that my pupil had spent his [[time]] in the tennis court as in
this manner; for there his [[body]] at least would have got exercise.

i well [[know]] that [[children]] ought to be kept employed, and that idleness
is for them the danger most to be feared. but what should they be
taught? this is undoubtedly an important [[question]]. let them be taught
what they are to practise when they come to be [[men]];[5] not what they
ought to forget.

our gardens are adorned with statues and our galleries with pictures.
what would you imagine these masterpieces of art [[arts]], thus exhibited to
public admiration, represent? the [[great]] [[men]], who have defended their
country, or the still greater [[men]] who have enriched it by their
virtues? far from it. they are the images of every perversion of heart
and [[mind]], carefully selected from ancient mythology, and presented
to the early curiosity of our [[children]], doubtless that they may have
before their [[eyes]] the representations of vicious actions, even before
they are able to [[read]].

whence arise all those abuses [[abuse]], unless it be from that fatal inequality
introduced among [[men]] by the difference of [[talents]] and the cheapening
of [[virtue]]? this is the most evident effect of all our studies, and the
most dangerous of all their consequences. the [[question]] is no longer
whether a [[man]] is honest, but whether he is clever. we do not ask
whether a [[book]] is useful, but whether it is well-written. rewards [[reward]] are
lavished on wit and ingenuity, while [[virtue]] is left unhonoured. there
are a thousand prizes for fine discourses, and none for [[good]] actions.
i should be glad, however, to [[know]] whether the [[honour]] attaching to the
best discourse that ever wins the prize in this academy is comparable
with the [[merit]] of having founded the prize.

a [[wise]] [[man]] does not go in chase of [[fortune]]; but he is by no means
insensible to [[glory]], and when he sees it so ill distributed, his
virtue, which might have been animated by a little emulation, and
turned to the advantage of [[society]], droops and dies away in obscurity
and indigence. it is for this [[reason]] that the agreeable [[arts]] must in
time everywhere be preferred to the useful; and this [[truth]] has been but
too much confirmed since the revival of the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]]. we have
physicists, geometricians, chemists, astronomers, poets, musicians, and
painters in plenty; but we have no longer a citizen among us; or if
there be found a few scattered over our abandoned countryside, they are
left to perish there unnoticed and neglected. such is the condition to
which we are reduced, and such are our feelings towards those who give
us our daily bread, and our [[children]] milk.

i confess, however, that the [[evil]] is not so [[great]] as it might
have become. the eternal providence, in placing salutary simples
beside noxious plants, and making poisonous animals contain their
own antidote, has taught the sovereigns [[sovereign]] of the [[earth]], who are its
ministers, to imitate its [[wisdom]]. it is by following this [[example]] that
the truly [[great]] monarch, to whose [[glory]] every [[age]] will add new lustre,
drew from the very bosom of the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]], the very fountains
of a thousand lapses from rectitude, those famous societies [[society]], which,
while they are depositaries of the dangerous trust of [[human]] [[knowledge]],
are yet the [[sacred]] guardians of morals [[moral]], by the attention they [[pay]] to
their maintenance among themselves in all their purity, and by the
demands which they make on every member whom they admit.

these [[wise]] [[institutions]], confirmed by his august successor and
imitated by all the kings [[king]] of [[europe]], will serve at least to restrain
men of letters, who, all aspiring to the [[honour]] of being admitted
into these academies, will keep watch over themselves, and endeavour
to make themselves worthy of such [[honour]] by useful performances and
irreproachable morals [[moral]]. those academies also, which, in proposing prizes
for literary [[merit]], make [[choice]] of such subjects [[subject]] as are calculated to
arouse the [[love]] of [[virtue]] in the hearts [[heart]] of [[citizens]], prove that it
prevails in themselves, and must give [[men]] the rare and real [[pleasure]] of
finding learned societies [[society]] devoting themselves to the enlightenment of
mankind, not only by agreeable exercises of the [[intellect]], but also by
useful instructions.

an objection which may be made is, in [[fact]], only an additional proof of
my argument. so much precaution proves but too evidently the need for
it. we never seek remedies for evils [[evil]] that do not [[exist]]. why, indeed,
must these bear all the marks of ordinary remedies, on account of their
inefficacy? the numerous establishments in favour of the learned are
only adapted to make [[men]] mistake the objects of the sciences [[science]], and turn
men's attention to the cultivation of them. one would be inclined to
think, from the precautions everywhere taken, that we are overstocked
with husbandmen, and are afraid of a shortage of [[philosophers]]. i
will not venture here to enter into a comparison between agriculture
and [[philosophy]], as they would not bear it. i shall only ask what is
philosophy? what is contained in the writings of the most celebrated
philosophers? what are the lessons of these [[friends]] of [[wisdom]]. to hear
them, should we not take them for so many mountebanks, exhibiting
themselves in [[public]], and crying out, _here, here, come to me, i am
the only true doctor_? one of them teaches [[teach]] that there is no such thing
as matter, but that everything exists only in representation. another
declares that there is no other substance than matter, and no other
god than the [[world]] itself. a third tells you that there are no such
things as [[virtue]] and [[vice]], and that [[moral]] [[good]] and [[evil]] are chimeras;
while a fourth informs you that [[men]] are only beasts of prey, and may
conscientiously devour one another. why, my [[great]] [[philosophers]], do you
not reserve these [[wise]] and profitable lessons for your [[friends]] and
children? you would soon reap the benefit of them, nor should we be
under any apprehension of our own becoming your disciples.

such are the wonderful [[men]], whom their contemporaries held in the
highest esteem during their lives [[life]], and to whom immortality has been
attributed since their decease. such are the [[wise]] maxims [[maxim]] we have
received from them, and which are transmitted, from [[age]] to [[age]], to our
descendants. paganism, though given over to all the extravagances of
human [[reason]], has left nothing to compare with the shameful monuments
which have been prepared by the art [[arts]] of printing, during the reign of
the gospel. the impious writings of leucippus and diagoras perished
with their authors. the [[world]], in their days, was ignorant of the art
of immortalising the errors and extravagancies of the [[human]] [[mind]].
but thanks to the art [[arts]] of printing[6] and the use we make of it, the
pernicious reflections of hobbes and spinoza will [[last]] for ever.
go, famous writings, of which the ignorance and rusticity of our
forefathers would have been incapable. go to our descendants, along
with those still more pernicious works [[work]] which reek of the corrupted
manners of the [[present]] age! let them together convey to posterity
a faithful [[history]] of the [[progress]] and advantages of our [[arts]] and
sciences. if they are [[read]], they will leave not a [[doubt]] about the
question we are now discussing, and unless [[mankind]] should then be still
more foolish than we, they will lift up their hands to [[heaven]] and
exclaim in bitterness of [[heart]]: "almighty god! thou who holdest in thy
hand the minds [[mind]] of [[men]], deliver us from the fatal [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] of
our forefathers; give us back ignorance, innocence and [[poverty]], which
alone can make us [[happy]] and are precious in thy sight."

but if the [[progress]] of the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] has added nothing to our
real [[happiness]]; if it has corrupted our morals [[moral]], and if that corruption
has vitiated our taste, what are we to [[think]] of the herd of text-book
authors, who have removed those impediments which [[nature]] purposely laid
in the way to the temple of the muses, in order to guard its approach
and try the powers [[power]] of those who might be tempted to seek [[knowledge]]?
what are we to [[think]] of those compilers who have indiscreetly broken
open the door of the sciences [[science]], and introduced into their sanctuary a
populace unworthy to approach it, when it was greatly to be wished that
all who should be found incapable of making a considerable [[progress]] in
the [[career]] of learning should have been repulsed at the entrance, and
thereby cast upon those [[arts]] which are useful to [[society]]. a [[man]] who
will be all his [[life]] a [[bad]] versifier, or a third-rate geometrician,
might have made nevertheless an excellent clothier. those whom nature
intended for her disciples have not needed masters. bacon, descartes
and newton, those teachers of [[mankind]], had themselves no teachers.
what guide indeed could have taken them so far as their sublime
genius directed them? ordinary masters would only have cramped their
intelligence, by confining it within the narrow limits of their own
capacity. it was from the obstacles they met with at first, that they
learned to exert themselves, and bestirred themselves to traverse the
vast field which they covered. if it be proper to allow some [[men]] to
apply themselves to the study of the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]], it is only
those who [[feel]] themselves able to walk alone in their footsteps and to
outstrip them. it belongs only to these few to raise monuments to the
glory of the [[human]] understanding. but if we are desirous that nothing
should be above their genius, nothing should be beyond their hopes [[hope]].
this is the only encouragement they require. the [[soul]] insensibly adapts
itself to the objects on which it is employed, and thus it is that
great occasions [[occasion]] [[produce]] [[great]] [[men]]. the [[greatest]] orator in the world
was consul of [[rome]], and perhaps the [[greatest]] of [[philosophers]] lord
chancellor of [[england]]. can it be conceived that, if the former had
only been a professor at some [[university]], and the latter a pensioner
of some academy, their works [[work]] would not have [[suffered]] from their
situation. let not princes [[prince]] disdain to admit into their councils those
who are most capable of giving them [[good]] [[advice]]. let them renounce the
old prejudice, which was [[invented]] by the [[pride]] of the [[great]], that the
art of governing [[mankind]] is more difficult than that of instructing
them; as if it was easier to induce [[men]] to do [[good]] voluntarily, than
to compel them to it by [[force]]. let the learned of the first rank find
an honourable refuge in their courts; let them there enjoy the only
recompense worthy of them, that of promoting by their influence the
happiness of the peoples [[people]] they have enlightened by their [[wisdom]]. it is
by this means only that we are likely to see what [[virtue]], [[science]] and
authority can do, when animated by the noblest emulation, and working
unanimously for the [[happiness]] of [[mankind]].

but so long as [[power]] alone is on one side, and [[knowledge]] and
understanding alone on the other, the learned will seldom make great
objects their study, princes [[prince]] will still more rarely do [[great]] actions,
and the peoples [[people]] will continue to be, as they are, mean, [[corrupt]] and
miserable.

as for us, ordinary [[men]], on whom [[heaven]] has not been pleased to bestow
such [[great]] [[talents]]; as we are not destined to reap such [[glory]], let
us remain in our obscurity. let us not covet a [[reputation]] we should
never attain, and which, in the [[present]] [[state]] of things, would never
make up to us for the trouble it would have cost us, even if we were
fully qualified to obtain it. why should we build our [[happiness]] on the
opinions of others, when we can find it in our own hearts [[heart]]? let us leave
to others the task of instructing [[mankind]] in their [[duty]], and confine
ourselves to the discharge of our own. we have no [[occasion]] for greater
knowledge than this.

virtue! sublime [[science]] of simple minds [[mind]], are such industry and
preparation needed if we are to [[know]] you? are not your principles
graven on every [[heart]]? need we do more, to learn your laws [[law]], than
examine ourselves, and listen to the voice of [[conscience]], when the
passions are silent?

this is the true [[philosophy]], with which we must learn to be content,
without envying the fame of those celebrated [[men]], whose names are
immortal in the [[republic]] of letters. let us, instead of envying them,
endeavour to make, between them and us, that honourable distinction
which was formerly seen to [[exist]] between two [[great]] peoples [[people]], that the
one knew how to speak, and the other how to act, aright.


[1] it is easy to see the allegory in the fable of prometheus: and it
does not appear that the greeks [[greek]], who chained him to the caucasus, had a
better [[opinion]] of him than the [[egyptians]] had of their [[god]] theutus. the
satyr, says an ancient fable, the first [[time]] he saw a [[fire]], was going
to kiss and embrace it; but prometheus cried out to him to forbear, or
his beard would rue it. it burns, says he, everything that touches it.

[2] the less we [[know]], the more we [[think]] we [[know]]. the peripatetics
doubted of nothing. did not descartes construct the [[universe]] with cubes
and vortices? and is there in all [[europe]] one [[single]] physicist who does
not boldly explain the inexplicable mysteries of electricity, which
will, perhaps, be for ever the despair of real [[philosophers]]?

[3] i am far from thinking that the ascendancy which [[women]] have
obtained over [[men]] is an [[evil]] in itself. it is a [[present]] which nature
has made them for the [[good]] of [[mankind]]. if [[better]] directed, it might
be productive of as much [[good]], as it is now of [[evil]]. we are not
sufficiently sensible of what advantage it would be to [[society]] to
give a [[better]] [[education]] to that half of our [[species]] which governs the
other. [[men]] will always be what [[women]] choose to make them. if you wish
then that they should be [[noble]] and [[virtuous]], let [[women]] be taught what
greatness of [[soul]] and [[virtue]] are. the reflections which this subject
arouses, and which [[plato]] formerly made, deserve to be more fully
developed by a pen worthy of following so [[great]] a master, and defending
so [[great]] a cause.

[4] pensées philosophiques (diderot).

[5] such was the [[education]] of the spartans with regard to one of the
greatest of their-kings. it is well worthy of notice, says montaigne,
that the excellent [[institutions]] of lycurgus, which were in truth
miraculously [[perfect]], paid as much attention to the bringing up of
youth as if this were their principal object, and yet, at the very seat
of the muses, they make so little mention of learning that it seems as
if their generous-spirited [[youth]] disdained every other restraint, and
required, instead of masters of the sciences [[science]], instructors in valour,
prudence and [[justice]] alone.

let us hear next what the same writer says of the ancient persians.
plato, says he, relates that the heir to the [[throne]] was thus brought
up. at his birth he was committed, not to the [[care]] of [[women]], but to
eunuchs in the highest [[authority]] and near the [[person]] of the [[king]], on
account of their [[virtue]]. these undertook to render his [[body]] beautiful
and healthy. at seven years of [[age]] they taught him to ride and go
hunting. at fourteen he was placed in the hands of four, the wisest,
the most just, the most temperate and the bravest persons [[person]] in the
kingdom. the first instructed him in [[religion]], the second taught him to
adhere inviolably to [[truth]], the third to conquer his [[passions]], and the
fourth to be afraid of nothing. all, i may add, taught him to be a good
man; but not one taught him to be learned.

astyages, in xenophon, desires [[desire]] cyrus to give him an account of his
last lesson. it was this, answered cyrus, one of the big boys, of the
school having a small coat, gave it to a little boy and took away from
him his coat, which was larger. our master having appointed me arbiter
in the dispute, i ordered that matters should stand as they were, as
each boy seemed to be [[better]] suited than before. the master, however,
remonstrated with me, saying that i considered only convenience,
whereas [[justice]] ought to have been the first concern, and justice
teaches that no one should suffer forcible interference with what
belongs to him. he added that he was punished for his [[wrong]] decision,
just as boys are punished in our [[country]] schools when they forget the
first aorist of _τύπτω_. my tutor must make me a fine harangue, _in
genere demonstrative_, before he will persuade me that his school is as
good as this.

[6] if we consider the frightful disorders which printing has already
caused in [[europe]], and [[judge]] of the future by the [[progress]] of its evils
from day to day, it is easy to foresee that sovereigns [[sovereign]] will hereafter
take as much pains [[pain]] to banish this dreadful art [[arts]] from their dominions,
as they ever took to encourage it the sultan achmet, yielding to the
importunities of [[certain]] pretenders to taste, consented to have a press
erected at constantinople; but it was hardly set to [[work]] before they
were obliged to [[destroy]] it, and throw the plant into a well.

it is related that the caliph omar, being [[asked]] what should be done
with the library at alexandria, answered in these words. "if the books
in the library contain anything contrary to the alcoran, they are evil
and ought to be burnt; if they contain only what the alcoran teaches [[teach]],
they are superfluous." this reasoning has been cited by oar [[men]] of
letters as the height of absurdity; but if gregory the [[great]] had been
in the place of omar, and the gospel in the place of the alcoran, the
library would still have been burnt, and it would have been perhaps the
finest action of his [[life]].




a discourse

on a [[subject]] proposed by the academy of dijon:

what is the origin of inequality among [[men]], and is it authorised by
natural [[law]]?

_non in depravatis, sed in his qua bene secundum naturam se habent,
considerandum est quid sit naturale._

aristotle, [[politics]], bk. i, ch. 2.

[we should consider what is [[natural]] not in things which are depraved
but in those which are rightly ordered according to [[nature]].]




dedication

to the

republic of geneva


most honourable, magnificent and [[sovereign]] lords [[lord]], convinced that
only a [[virtuous]] citizen can confer on his [[country]] honours [[honour]] which it
can accept, i have been for thirty years [[past]] working to make myself
worthy to offer you some [[public]] homage; and, this fortunate opportunity
supplementing in some [[degree]] the insufficiency of my efforts, i have
thought myself entitled to [[follow]] in embracing it the dictates of the
zeal which inspires me, rather than the [[right]] which should have been my
authorisation. having had the [[happiness]] to be born among you, how could
i reflect on the equality which [[nature]] has ordained between [[men]], and
the inequality which they have introduced, without reflecting on the
profound [[wisdom]] by which both are in this [[state]] happily combined and
made to coincide, in the manner that is most in conformity with natural
law, and most favourable to [[society]], to the maintenance of [[public]] order
and to the [[happiness]] of individuals [[individual]]? in my researches after the best
rules [[common]] sense can lay down for the [[constitution]] of a [[government]],
i have been so struck at finding them all in actuality in your own,
that even had i not been born within your walls i should have thought
it indispensable for me to offer this picture of [[human]] [[society]] to that
people, which of all others seems to be possessed of its greatest
advantages, and to have [[best]] guarded against its abuses [[abuse]].

if i had had to make [[choice]] of the place of my birth, i should have
preferred a [[society]] which had an extent proportionate to the limits
of the [[human]] faculties; that is, to the possibility of being well
governed: in which every [[person]] being [[equal]] to his occupation, no one
should be obliged to commit to others the functions with which he was
entrusted: a [[state]], in which all the individuals [[individual]] being well known to
one another, neither the secret machinations of [[vice]], nor the modesty
of [[virtue]] should be able to escape the notice and [[judgment]] of the
public; and in which the pleasant custom of seeing and knowing one
another should make the [[love]] of [[country]] rather a [[love]] of the citizens
than of its soil.

i should have wished to be born in a [[country]] in which the interest of
the [[sovereign]] and that of the [[people]] must be [[single]] and identical; to
the end that all the movements of the machine might tend always to
the general [[happiness]]. and as this could not be the case, unless the
sovereign and the [[people]] were one and the same [[person]], it follows that
i should have wished to be born under a democratic [[government]], wisely
tempered.

i should have wished to [[live]] and [[die]] [[free]]: that is, so far [[subject]] to
the laws [[law]] that neither i, nor anybody else, should be able to cast off
their honourable yoke: the easy and salutary yoke which the haughtiest
necks bear with the greater docility, as they are made to bear no other.

i should have wished then that no one within the [[state]] should be able
to say he was above the [[law]]; and that no one without should be able to
dictate so that the [[state]] should be obliged to recognise his [[authority]].
for, be the [[constitution]] of a [[government]] what it may, if there be
within its jurisdiction a [[single]] [[man]] who is not [[subject]] to the [[law]], all
the rest are necessarily at his discretion. and if there be a national
ruler within, and a [[foreign]] ruler without, however they may divide
their [[authority]], it is impossible that both should be duly obeyed, or
that the [[state]] should be well governed.

i should not have chosen to [[live]] in a [[republic]] of recent institution,
however excellent its laws [[law]]; for [[fear]] the [[government]], being perhaps
otherwise framed than the circumstances of the moment might require,
might disagree with the new [[citizens]], or they with it, and the state
run the risk of overthrow and destruction almost as soon as it came
into being. for it is with [[liberty]] as it is with those solid and
succulent foods, or with those generous wines which are well adapted
to nourish and fortify robust constitutions [[constitution]] that are used to them,
but ruin and intoxicate [[weak]] and delicate constitutions [[constitution]] to which they
are not suited. peoples [[people]] once accustomed to masters are not in a
condition to do without them. if they attempt to shake off the yoke,
they still more estrange themselves from [[freedom]], as, by mistaking for
it an unbridled license to which it is diametrically opposed, they
nearly always manage, by their revolutions [[revolution]], to hand themselves over to
seducers, who only make their chains heavier than before. the roman
people itself, a model for all [[free]] peoples [[people]], was wholly incapable of
governing itself when it escaped from the oppression of the tarquins.
debased by [[slavery]], and the ignominious tasks which had been imposed
upon it, it was at first no [[better]] than a stupid mob, which it was
necessary to control and govern with the [[greatest]] [[wisdom]]; in order
that, being accustomed by degrees [[degree]] to breathe the health-giving air of
liberty, minds [[mind]] which had been enervated or rather brutalised under
tyranny, might gradually acquire that severity of morals [[moral]] and spirit
of fortitude which made it at length the [[people]] of all most worthy of
respect. i should, then, have sought out for my [[country]] some peaceful
and [[happy]] [[republic]], of an antiquity that lost itself, as it were, in
the night of [[time]]: which had experienced only such shocks as served to
manifest and strengthen the [[courage]] and [[patriotism]] of its subjects [[subject]]; and
whose [[citizens]], long accustomed to a [[wise]] independence, were not only
free, but worthy to be so.

i should have wished to choose myself a [[country]], diverted, by a
fortunate impotence, from the brutal [[love]] of [[conquest]], and secured, by
a still more fortunate situation, from the [[fear]] of becoming itself the
conquest of other states: a [[free]] [[city]] situated between several nations,
none of which should have any interest in attacking it, while each
had an interest in preventing it from being attacked by the others;
in short, a [[republic]] which should have nothing to tempt the ambition
of its neighbours, but might reasonably depend on their assistance in
case of need. it follows that a republican [[state]] so happily situated
could have nothing to [[fear]] but from itself; and that, if its members
trained themselves to the use of arms, it would be rather to keep alive
that [[military]] ardour and courageous spirit which are so proper among
free-men, and tend to keep up their taste for [[liberty]], than from the
necessity of providing for their defence.

i should have sought a [[country]], in which the [[right]] of legislation
was vested in all the [[citizens]]; for who can [[judge]] [[better]] than they of
the conditions under which they had [[best]] dwell together in the same
society? not that i should have approved of plebiscita, like those
among the romans; in which the rulers in the [[state]], and those most
interested in its preservation, were excluded from the deliberations on
which in many cases its security depended; and in which, by the most
absurd inconsistency, the magistrates were deprived of rights [[right]] which the
meanest [[citizens]] enjoyed.

on the contrary, i should have [[desired]] that, in order to prevent
self-interested and ill-conceived projects, and all such dangerous
innovations as finally ruined the athenians, each [[man]] should not be at
liberty to propose new laws [[law]] at [[pleasure]]; but that this [[right]] should
belong exclusively to the magistrates; and that even they should use it
with so much caution, the [[people]], on its side, be so reserved in giving
its [[consent]] to such laws [[law]], and the promulgation of them be attended
with so much solemnity, that before the [[constitution]] could be upset by
them, there might be [[time]] enough for all to be convinced, that it is
above all the [[great]] antiquity of the laws [[law]] which makes them [[sacred]] and
venerable, that [[men]] soon learn to despise laws [[law]] which they see daily
altered, and that states, by accustoming themselves to neglect their
ancient customs under the pretext of improvement, often introduce
greater evils [[evil]] than those they endeavour to remove.

i should have particularly avoided, as necessarily ill-governed, a
republic in which the [[people]], imagining themselves in a position
to do without magistrates, or at least to leave them with only a
precarious [[authority]], should imprudently have kept for themselves the
administration of civil affairs and the execution of their own laws [[law]].
such must have been the rude [[constitution]] of primitive governments [[government]],
directly emerging from a [[state]] of [[nature]]; and this was another of the
vices that contributed to the downfall of the [[republic]] of [[athens]].

but i should have chosen a [[community]] in which the individuals [[individual]],
content with sanctioning their laws [[law]], and deciding the most important
public affairs in general assembly and on the motion of the rulers,
had established honoured tribunals, carefully distinguished the
several departments, and elected year by year some of the most
capable and upright of their fellow-citizens to administer justice
and govern the [[state]]; a [[community]], in short, in which the [[virtue]] of
the magistrates thus bearing witness to the [[wisdom]] of the [[people]],
each class reciprocally did the other [[honour]]. if in such a case any
fatal misunderstandings arose to disturb the [[public]] [[peace]], even these
intervals of blindness and error would bear the marks of moderation,
mutual esteem, and a [[common]] [[respect]] for the laws [[law]]; which are sure signs
and pledges of a reconciliation as lasting as sincere. such are the
advantages, most honourable, magnificent and [[sovereign]] lords [[lord]], which i
should have sought in the [[country]] in which i should have chosen to be
born. and if providence had added to all these a delightful situation,
a temperate [[climate]], a fertile soil, and the most beautiful countryside
under [[heaven]], i should have [[desired]] only, to complete my felicity, the
peaceful enjoyment of all these blessings, in the bosom of this happy
country; to [[live]] at [[peace]] in the sweet [[society]] of my fellow-citizens,
and practising towards them, from their own [[example]], the duties [[duty]] of
friendship, [[humanity]], and every other [[virtue]], to leave behind me the
honourable memory of a [[good]] [[man]], and an upright and [[virtuous]] patriot.

but, if less fortunate or too late grown [[wise]], i had seen myself
reduced to end an infirm and languishing [[life]] in other climates, vainly
regretting that peaceful repose which i had forfeited in the imprudence
of [[youth]], i should at least have entertained the same feelings in my
heart, though denied the opportunity of making use of them in my native
country. filled with a tender and disinterested [[love]] for my distant
fellow-citizens, i should have addressed them from my [[heart]], much in
the following terms.

"my dear fellow-citizens, or rather my brothers [[brother]], since the ties of
blood, as well as the laws [[law]], unite almost all of us, it gives me
pleasure that i cannot [[think]] of you, without thinking, at the same
time, of all the blessings you enjoy, and of which none of you,
perhaps, more deeply feels [[feel]] the value than i who have lost them. the
more i reflect on your civil and [[political]] condition, the less can i
conceive that the [[nature]] of [[human]] affairs could admit of a [[better]].
in all other governments [[government]], when there is a [[question]] of ensuring the
greatest [[good]] of the [[state]], nothing gets beyond projects and ideas [[idea]], or
at [[best]] bare possibilities. but as for you, your [[happiness]] is complete,
and you have nothing to do but enjoy it; you require nothing more to be
made perfectly [[happy]], than to [[know]] how to be satisfied with being so.
your sovereignty, acquired or recovered by the [[sword]], and maintained
for two centuries [[past]] by your valour and [[wisdom]], is at length fully
and universally acknowledged. your boundaries are fixed, your rights
confirmed and your repose secured by honourable treaties. your
constitution is excellent, being not only dictated by the profoundest
wisdom, but guaranteed by [[great]] and friendly powers [[power]]. your [[state]] enjoys
perfect tranquillity; you have neither wars [[war]] nor conquerors to [[fear]]; you
have no other master than the [[wise]] laws [[law]] you have yourselves made; and
these are administered by upright magistrates of your own choosing. you
are neither so wealthy as to be enervated by effeminacy, and thence
to lose, in the pursuit of frivolous pleasures [[pleasure]], the taste for real
happiness and solid [[virtue]]; nor [[poor]] enough to require more assistance
from abroad than your own industry is sufficient to procure you. in the
meantime the precious [[privilege]] of [[liberty]], which in [[great]] nations is
maintained only by submission to the most exorbitant impositions, costs
you hardly anything for its preservation.

may a [[republic]], so wisely and happily constituted, [[last]] for ever, for
an [[example]] to other nations, and for the felicity of its own citizens!
this is the only prayer you have left to make, the only precaution
that remains to be taken. it depends, for the future, on yourselves
alone (not to make you [[happy]], for your [[ancestors]] have saved you that
trouble), but to render that [[happiness]] lasting, by your [[wisdom]] in
its enjoyment. it is on your constant union, your [[obedience]] to the
laws, and your [[respect]] for their ministers, that your preservation
depends. if there remains among you the smallest trace of bitterness
or distrust, hasten to [[destroy]] it, as an accursed leaven which sooner
or later must bring misfortune and ruin on the [[state]]. i conjure you
all to look into your hearts [[heart]], and to hearken to the secret voice
of [[conscience]]. is there any among you who can find, throughout the
universe, a more upright, more enlightened and more honourable body
than your magistracy? do not all its members set you an [[example]] of
moderation, of simplicity of manners, of [[respect]] for the laws [[law]], and of
the most sincere harmony? place, therefore, without reserve, in such
wise superiors, that salutary confidence which [[reason]] ever owes to
virtue. consider that they are your own [[choice]], that they justify that
choice, and that the honours [[honour]] due to those whom you have dignified are
necessarily yours by reflexion. not one of you is so ignorant as not to
know that, when the laws [[law]] lose their [[force]] and those who defend them
their [[authority]], security and [[liberty]] are universally impossible. why,
therefore, should you hesitate to do that cheerfully and with just
confidence which you would all along have been bound to do by your true
interest, your [[duty]] and [[reason]] itself?

let not a culpable and pernicious indifference to the maintenance
of the [[constitution]] ever induce you to neglect, in case of need,
the prudent [[advice]] of the most enlightened and zealous of your
fellow-citizens; but let equity, moderation and firmness of resolution
continue to regulate all your proceedings, and to exhibit you to the
whole [[universe]] as the [[example]] of a valiant and modest [[people]], jealous
equally of their [[honour]] and of their [[liberty]]. beware particularly, as
the [[last]] piece of [[advice]] i shall give you, of sinister constructions
and venomous rumours, the secret motives of which are often more
dangerous than the actions at which they are levelled. a whole house
will be awake and take the first alarm given by a [[good]] and trusty
watch-dog, who barks only at the approach of thieves; but we hate the
importunity of those noisy curs, which are perpetually disturbing the
public repose, and whose continual ill-timed warnings prevent our
attending to them, when they may perhaps be necessary."

and you, most honourable and magnificent lords [[lord]], the worthy and revered
magistrates of a [[free]] [[people]], permit me to offer you in particular
my [[duty]] and homage. if there is in the [[world]] a station capable of
conferring [[honour]] on those who fill it, it is undoubtedly that
which [[virtue]] and [[talents]] combine to bestow, that of which you have
made yourselves worthy, and to which you have been promoted by your
fellow-citizens. their worth adds a new lustre to your own; while, as
you have been chosen, by [[men]] capable of governing others, to govern
themselves, i cannot but hold you as much superior to all other
magistrates, as a [[free]] [[people]], and particularly that over which you
have the [[honour]] to preside, is by its [[wisdom]] and its [[reason]] superior to
the populace of other states.

be it permitted me to cite an [[example]] of which there ought to have
existed [[better]] records, and one which will be ever near to my [[heart]].
i cannot recall to [[mind]], without the sweetest emotions, the memory of
that [[virtuous]] citizen, to whom i owe my being, and by whom i was often
instructed, in my infancy, in the [[respect]] which is due to you. i see
him still, living by the [[work]] of his hands, and feeding his [[soul]] on the
sublimest truths [[truth]]. i see the works [[work]] of tacitus, plutarch and grotius,
lying before him in the midst of the tools of his [[trade]]. at his side
stands his dear [[son]], receiving, alas with too little [[profit]], the tender
instructions of the [[best]] of fathers [[father]]. but, if the follies of [[youth]] made
me for a while forget his [[wise]] lessons, i have at length the happiness
to be conscious that, whatever propensity one may have to [[vice]], it is
not easy for an [[education]], with which [[love]] has mingled, to be entirely
thrown away.

such, my most honourable and magnificent lords [[lord]], are the [[citizens]], and
even the [[common]] inhabitants of the [[state]] which you govern; such are
those [[intelligent]] and sensible [[men]], of whom, under the name of workmen
and the [[people]], it is usual, in other nations, to have a low and false
opinion. my [[father]], i own with [[pleasure]], was in no way distinguished
among his fellow-citizens. he was only such as they all are; and yet,
such as he was, there is no [[country]], in which his acquaintance would
not have been coveted, and cultivated even with advantage by [[men]] of the
highest [[character]]. it would not become me, nor is it, thank [[heaven]], at
all necessary for me to remind you of the regard which such [[men]] have a
right to expect of their magistrates, to whom they are [[equal]] both by
education and by the rights [[right]] of [[nature]] and birth, and inferior only, by
their own will, by that preference which they owe to your [[merit]], and,
for giving you, can claim some sort of acknowledgment on your side. it
is with a lively satisfaction i [[understand]] that the [[greatest]] candour
and condescension attend, in all your behaviour towards them, on that
gravity which becomes the ministers of the [[law]]; and that you so well
repay them, by your esteem and attention, the [[respect]] and obedience
which they owe to you. this conduct is not only just but prudent; as it
happily tends to obliterate the memory of many unhappy events, which
ought to be buried in eternal oblivion. it is also so much the more
judicious, as it tends to make this generous and equitable [[people]] find
a [[pleasure]] in their [[duty]]; to make them naturally [[love]] to do you [[honour]],
and to cause those who are the most zealous in the maintenance of their
own rights [[right]] to be at the same [[time]] the most disposed to [[respect]] yours.

it ought not to be [[thought]] surprising that the rulers of a civil
society should have the welfare and [[glory]] of their communities [[community]] at
heart: but it is uncommonly fortunate for the [[peace]] of [[men]], when those
persons who look upon themselves as the magistrates, or rather the
masters of a more holy and sublime [[country]], show some [[love]] for the
earthly [[country]] which maintains them. i am [[happy]] in having it in my
power to make so singular an exception in our favour, and to be able to
rank, among its [[best]] [[citizens]], those zealous depositaries of the sacred
articles of [[faith]] established by the laws [[law]], those venerable shepherds of
souls whose powerful and captivating eloquence are so much the better
calculated to bear to men's hearts [[heart]] the maxims [[maxim]] of the gospel, as they
are themselves the first to put them into practice. all the [[world]] knows
of the [[great]] [[success]] with which the art [[arts]] of the pulpit is cultivated at
geneva; but [[men]] are so used to hearing divines preach one thing and
practise another, that few have a [[chance]] of knowing how far the spirit
of [[christianity]], holiness of manners, severity towards themselves and
indulgence towards their neighbours, prevail throughout the whole body
of our ministers. it is, perhaps, given to the [[city]] of geneva alone,
to [[produce]] the edifying [[example]] of so [[perfect]] a union between its
clergy and [[men]] of letters. it is in [[great]] measure on their [[wisdom]],
their known moderation, and their zeal for the [[prosperity]] of the state
that i build my hopes [[hope]] of its perpetual tranquillity. at the same [[time]],
i notice, with a [[pleasure]] mingled with surprise and veneration, how
much they detest the frightful maxims [[maxim]] of those accursed and barbarous
men, of whom [[history]] furnishes us with more than one [[example]]; who, in
order to support the pretended rights [[right]] of [[god]], that is to say their own
interests, have been so much the less greedy of [[human]] [[blood]], as they
were more hopeful their own in particular would be always respected.

i must not forget that precious half of the [[republic]], which makes the
happiness of the other; and whose sweetness and prudence preserve its
tranquillity and [[virtue]]. amiable and [[virtuous]] daughters [[daughter]] of geneva,
it will be always the lot of your [[sex]] to govern ours. [[happy]] are we,
so long as your chaste influence, solely exercised within the limits
of conjugal union, is exerted only for the [[glory]] of the [[state]] and
the [[happiness]] of the [[public]]. it was thus the female [[sex]] commanded at
sparta; and thus you deserve to command at geneva. what [[man]] can be such
a barbarian as to resist the voice of [[honour]] and [[reason]], coming from
the lips of an affectionate [[wife]]? who would not despise; the vanities
of luxury, on beholding the simple and modest attire which, from the
lustre it derives from you, seems the most favourable to [[beauty]]? it
is your task to perpetuate, by your insinuating influence and your
innocent and amiable [[rule]], a [[respect]] for the laws [[law]] of the [[state]], and
harmony among the [[citizens]]. it is yours to reunite divided families [[family]] by
happy marriages [[marriage]]; and, above all things, to [[correct]], by the persuasive
sweetness of your lessons and the modest graces of your conversation,
those extravagancies which our [[young]] [[people]] pick up in other countries [[country]],
whence, instead of many useful things by which they might [[profit]], they
bring [[home]] hardly anything, besides a puerile air and a ridiculous
manner, acquired among loose [[women]], but an admiration for i [[know]] not
what so-called grandeur, and paltry recompenses for being slaves [[slave]], which
can never come near the real greatness of [[liberty]]. continue, therefore,
always to be what you are, the chaste guardians of our morals [[moral]], and the
sweet security for our [[peace]], exerting on every [[occasion]] the privileges
of the [[heart]] and of [[nature]], in the interests of [[duty]] and [[virtue]].

i flatter myself that i shall never be proved to have been mistaken, in
building on such a foundation my hopes [[hope]] of the general [[happiness]] of the
citizens and the [[glory]] of the [[republic]]. it must be confessed, however,
that with all these advantages, it will not shine with that lustre, by
which the [[eyes]] of most [[men]] are dazzled; a puerile and fatal taste for
which is the most mortal [[enemy]] of [[happiness]] and [[liberty]].

let our dissolute [[youth]] seek elsewhere [[light]] pleasures [[pleasure]] and long
repentances. let our pretenders to taste [[admire]] elsewhere the
grandeur of palaces, the [[beauty]] of equipages, sumptuous furniture,
the pomp of [[public]] entertainments, and all the refinements of luxury
and effeminacy. geneva boasts nothing but [[men]]; such a sight has
nevertheless a value of its own, and those who have a taste for it are
well worth the admirers of all the rest.

deign, most honourable, magnificent and [[sovereign]] lords [[lord]], to receive,
and with [[equal]] goodness, this respectful testimony of the interest i
take in your [[common]] [[prosperity]]. and, if i have been so unhappy as to
be guilty of any indiscreet transport in this glowing effusion of my
heart, i beseech you to pardon me, and to attribute it to the tender
affection of a true patriot, and to the ardent and legitimate zeal of
a [[man]], who can imagine for himself no greater felicity than to see you
happy.

most honourable, magnificent and [[sovereign]] lords [[lord]], i am, with the most
profound [[respect]],

your most humble and [[obedient]] servant and fellow-citizen.

preface


of all [[human]] sciences [[science]] the most useful and most imperfect appears
to me to be that of [[mankind]]: and i will venture to say, the single
inscription on the temple of delphi contained a precept more difficult
and more important than is to be found in all the huge volumes that
moralists have ever written. i consider the [[subject]] of the following
discourse as one of the most interesting questions [[question]] philosophy
can propose, and unhappily for us, one of, the most thorny that
philosophers can have to solve. for how shall we [[know]] the source of
inequality between [[men]], if we do not begin by knowing [[mankind]]? and
how shall [[man]] [[hope]] to see himself as [[nature]] made him, across all the
changes which the succession of place and [[time]] must have produced in
his original [[constitution]]? how can he distinguish what is fundamental
in his [[nature]] from the changes [[change]] and additions which his circumstances
and the advances he has made have introduced to modify his primitive
condition? like the statue of glaucus, which was so disfigured by [[time]],
seas and tempests, that it looked more like a wild beast than a [[god]],
the [[human]] [[soul]], altered in [[society]] by a thousand causes perpetually
recurring, by the acquisition of a multitude of truths [[truth]] and errors,
by the changes [[change]] happening to the [[constitution]] of the [[body]], and by
the continual jarring of the [[passions]], has, so to speak, changed in
appearance, so as to be hardly recognisable. instead of a being,
acting constantly from fixed and invariable principles [[principle]], instead of
that celestial and majestic simplicity, impressed on it by its divine
author, we find in it only the frightful contrast of passion mistaking
itself for [[reason]], and of understanding grown delirious.

it is still more cruel that, as every advance made by the [[human]] species
removes it still farther from its primitive [[state]], the more discoveries
we make, the more we deprive ourselves of the means of making the most
important of all. thus it is, in one sense, by our very study of [[man]],
that the [[knowledge]] of him is put out of our [[power]].

it is easy to perceive that it is in these successive changes [[change]] in
the [[constitution]] of [[man]] that we must look for the origin of those
differences which now distinguish [[men]], who, it is allowed, are as equal
among themselves as were the animals of every [[kind]], before physical
causes had introduced those varieties which are now observable among
some of them.

it is, in [[fact]], not to be conceived that these primary changes [[change]], however
they may have arisen, could have altered, all at once and in the same
manner, every [[individual]] of the [[species]]. it is [[natural]] to [[think]] that,
while the condition of some of them grew [[better]] or worse, and they
were acquiring various [[good]] or [[bad]] qualities not inherent in their
nature, there were others who continued a longer [[time]] in their original
condition. such was doubtless the first source of the inequality of
mankind, which it is much easier to point out thus in general terms,
than to assign with precision to its actual causes.

let not my readers therefore imagine that i flatter myself with having
seen what it appears to me so difficult to discover. i have here
entered upon [[certain]] arguments, and risked some conjectures, less in
the [[hope]] of solving the difficulty, than with a view to throwing some
light upon it, and reducing the [[question]] to its proper form. others may
easily proceed farther on the same road, and yet no one find it very
easy to get to the end. for it is by no means a [[light]] undertaking to
distinguish properly between what is original and what is artificial
in the actual [[nature]] of [[man]], or to form a true [[idea]] of a [[state]] which
no longer exists, perhaps never did [[exist]], and probably never will
exist; and of which, it is, nevertheless, necessary to have true
ideas, in order to form a proper [[judgment]] of our [[present]] [[state]]. it
requires, indeed, more [[philosophy]] than can be imagined to enable any
one to determine exactly what precautions he ought to take, in order
to make solid observations on this [[subject]]; and it appears to me that
a [[good]] solution of the following problem would be not unworthy of the
aristotles and plinys of the [[present]] [[age]]. _what experiments would have
to be made, to discover the [[natural]] [[man]]? and how are those experiments
to be made in a [[state]] of society_?

so far am i from undertaking to solve this problem, that i [[think]] i have
sufficiently, considered the [[subject]], to venture to declare beforehand
that our [[greatest]] [[philosophers]] would not be too [[good]] to direct such
experiments, and our most powerful sovereigns [[sovereign]] to make them. such a
combination we have very little [[reason]] to expect, especially attended
with the perseverance, or rather succession of [[intelligence]] and
good-will necessary on both sides to [[success]].

these investigations, which are so difficult to make, and have been
hitherto so little [[thought]] of, are, nevertheless, the only means that
remain of obviating a multitude of difficulties which deprive us of
the [[knowledge]] of the real foundations of [[human]] [[society]]. it is this
ignorance of the [[nature]] of [[man]], which casts so much uncertainty and
obscurity on the true definition of [[natural]] [[right]]: for, the [[idea]] of
right, says burlamaqui, and more particularly that of [[natural]] [[right]],
are ideas [[idea]] manifestly relative to the [[nature]] of [[man]]. it is then from
this very [[nature]] itself, he goes on, from the [[constitution]] and [[state]] of
man, that we must deduce the first principles [[principle]] of this [[science]].

we cannot see without surprise and disgust how little agreement there
is between the different authors who have treated this [[great]] [[subject]].
among the more important writers there are scarcely two of the same
mind about it. not to speak of the ancient [[philosophers]], who seem
to have done their [[best]] purposely to contradict one another on the
most fundamental principles [[principle]], the roman jurists subjected [[man]] and the
other animals indiscriminately to the same [[natural]] [[law]], because they
considered, under that name, rather the [[law]] which [[nature]] imposes on
herself than that which she prescribes to others; or rather because
of the particular acceptation of the term [[law]] among those jurists;
who seem on this [[occasion]] to have understood nothing more by it than
the general relations established by [[nature]] between all animated
beings, for their [[common]] preservation. the moderns, understanding,
by the term [[law]], merely a [[rule]] prescribed to a [[moral]] being, that is
to say [[intelligent]], [[free]] and considered in his relations to other
beings, consequently confine the jurisdiction of [[natural]] [[law]] to [[man]],
an the only animal endowed with [[reason]]. but, defining this [[law]], each
after his own [[fashion]], they have established it on such metaphysical
principles, that there are very few persons [[person]] among us capable of
comprehending them, much less of discovering them for themselves. so
that the definitions of these learned [[men]], all differing in everything
else, agree only in this, that it is impossible to comprehend the law
of [[nature]], and consequently to obey it, without being a very subtle
casuist and a profound metaphysician. all which is as much as to say
that [[mankind]] must have employed, in the establishment of [[society]], a
capacity which is acquired only with [[great]] difficulty, and by very few
persons, even in a [[state]] of [[society]].

knowing so little of [[nature]], and agreeing so ill about the meaning
of the word _law_, it would be difficult for us to fix on a good
definition of [[natural]] [[law]]. thus all the definitions we meet with in
books, setting: aside their defect in point of uniformity, have yet
another [[fault]], in that they are derived from many kinds [[kind]] of [[knowledge]],
which [[men]] do not possess naturally, and from advantages of which they
can have no [[idea]] until they have already departed from that [[state]].
modern writers begin by inquiring what rules [[rule]] it would be expedient
for [[men]] to agree on for their [[common]] interest, and then give the name
of [[natural]] [[law]] to a collection of these rules [[rule]], without any other
proof than the [[good]] that would result from their being universally
practised. this is undoubtedly a simple way of making definitions, and
of explaining the [[nature]] of things by almost arbitrary conveniences.

but as long as we are ignorant of the [[natural]] [[man]], it is in [[vain]] for us
to attempt to determine either the [[law]] originally prescribed to him, or
that which is [[best]] adapted to his [[constitution]]. all we can [[know]] with
any certainty respecting this [[law]] is that, if it is to be a [[law]], not
only the wills of those it obliges must be sensible of their submission
to it; but also, to be [[natural]], it must come directly from the voice of
nature.

throwing aside, therefore, all those scientific books [[book]], which [[teach]] us
only to see [[men]] such as they have made themselves, and contemplating
the first and most simple operations of the [[human]] [[soul]], i [[think]] i can
perceive in it two principles [[principle]] prior to [[reason]], one of them deeply
interesting us in our own welfare and preservation, and the other
exciting a [[natural]] repugnance at seeing any other sensible being, and
particularly any of our own [[species]], suffer [[pain]] or [[death]]. it is from
the agreement and combination which the understanding is in a position
to establish between these two principles [[principle]], without its being necessary
to introduce that of sociability, that all the rules [[rule]] of [[natural]] right
appear to me to be derived--rules which our [[reason]] is afterwards
obliged to establish on other foundations, when by its successive
developments it has been [[led]] to suppress [[nature]] itself.

in proceeding thus, we shall not be obliged to make [[man]] a philosopher
before he is a [[man]]. his duties [[duty]] toward others are not dictated to him
only by the later lessons of [[wisdom]] and, so long as he does not resist
the internal impulse of compassion, he will never hurt any other [[man]],
nor even any sentient being; except on those lawful occasions [[occasion]] on which
his own preservation is concerned and he is obliged to give himself
the preference. by this method also we put an end to the time-honoured
disputes concerning the participation of animals in [[natural]] [[law]]: for it
is clear that, being destitute of [[intelligence]] and [[liberty]], they cannot
recognise that [[law]]; as they partake, however, in some measure of our
nature, in consequence of the sensibility with which they are endowed,
they ought to partake of [[natural]] rights [[right]] so that [[mankind]] is subjected
to a [[kind]] of obligation even toward the brutes. it appears, in [[fact]],
that if i am bound to do no injury to my fellow-creatures, this is less
because they are [[rational]] than because they are sentient beings: and
this quality, being [[common]] both to [[men]] and beasts, ought to entitle the
latter at least to the [[privilege]] of not being wantonly ill-treated by
the former.

the very study of the original [[man]], of his real wants, and the
fundamental principles [[principle]] of his [[duty]], is besides the only proper method
we can adopt to obviate all the difficulties which the origin of moral
inequality presents [[present]], on the true foundations of the [[body]] [[politic]], on
the reciprocal rights [[right]] of its members, and on many other similar topics
equally important and obscure.

if we look at [[human]] [[society]] with a calm and disinterested eye, it
seems, at first, to show us only the [[violence]] of the powerful and
the oppression of the [[weak]]. the [[mind]] is shocked at the [[cruelty]] of
the one, or is induced to lament the blindness of the other; and as
nothing is less permanent in [[life]] than those external relations, which
are more frequently produced by accident than [[wisdom]], and which are
called weakness or [[power]], riches [[rich]] or [[poverty]], all [[human]] institutions
seem at first glance to be founded merely on banks of shifting sand. it
is only by taking a closer look, and removing the dust and sand that
surround the edifice, that we perceive the immovable basis on which it
is raised, and learn to [[respect]] its foundations. now, without a serious
study of [[man]], his [[natural]] faculties and their successive [[development]],
we shall never be able to make these necessary distinctions, or to
separate, in the actual [[constitution]] of things, that which is the
effect of the [[divine]] will, from the innovations attempted by human
art. the [[political]] and [[moral]] investigations, therefore, to which the
important [[question]] before us leads, are in every [[respect]] useful; while
the hypothetical [[history]] of governments [[government]] affords a lesson equally
instructive to [[mankind]].

in considering what we should have become, had we been left to
ourselves, we should learn to bless him, whose gracious hand,
correcting our [[institutions]], and giving them an immovable basis, has
prevented those disorders which would otherwise have arisen from them,
and caused our [[happiness]] to come from those very sources which seemed
likely to involve us in misery.

a dissertation

on the origin and foundation of the inequality of mankind


it is of [[man]] that i have to speak; and the [[question]] i am investigating
shows me that it is to [[men]] that i must address myself: for questions
of this sort are not [[asked]] by those who are afraid to [[honour]] [[truth]]. i
shall then confidently uphold the cause of [[humanity]] before the wise
men who invite me to do so, and shall not be dissatisfied if i acquit
myself in a manner worthy of my [[subject]] and of my judges [[judge]].

i conceive that there are two kinds [[kind]] of inequality among the human
species; one, which i call [[natural]] or physical, because it is
established by [[nature]], and consists in a difference of [[age]], health,
bodily [[strength]], and the qualities of the [[mind]] or of the [[soul]]: and
another, which may be called [[moral]] or [[political]] inequality, because
it depends on a [[kind]] of convention, and is established, or at least
authorised by the [[consent]] of [[men]]. this latter consists of the different
privileges, which some [[men]] enjoy to the prejudice of others; such as
that of being more [[rich]], more honoured, more powerful or even in a
position to exact [[obedience]].

it is useless to ask what is the source of [[natural]] inequality, because
that [[question]] is answered by the simple definition of the word. again,
it is still more useless to inquire whether there is any essential
connection between the two inequalities; for this would be only asking,
in other words, whether those who command are necessarily [[better]] than
those who obey, and if [[strength]] of [[body]] or of [[mind]], [[wisdom]] or virtue
are always found in particular individuals [[individual]], in proportion to their
power or [[wealth]]: a [[question]] fit perhaps to be discussed by slaves [[slave]] in
the hearing of their masters, but highly unbecoming to reasonable and
free [[men]] in search of the [[truth]].

the [[subject]] of the [[present]] discourse, therefore, is more precisely
this. to mark, in the [[progress]] of things, the moment at which right
took the place of [[violence]] and [[nature]] became [[subject]] to [[law]], and to
explain by what sequence of [[miracles]] the [[strong]] came to submit to serve
the [[weak]], and the [[people]] to purchase imaginary repose at the expense of
real felicity.

the [[philosophers]], who have inquired into the foundations of [[society]],
have all [[felt]] the necessity of going back to a [[state]] of [[nature]]; but not
one of them has got there. some of them have not hesitated to ascribe
to [[man]], in such a [[state]], the [[idea]] of just and [[unjust]], without troubling
themselves to show that he must be possessed of such an [[idea]], or that
it could be of any use to him. others have spoken of the [[natural]] right
of every [[man]] to keep what belongs to him, without explaining what
they meant by _belongs_. others again, beginning by giving the strong
authority over the [[weak]], proceeded directly to the birth of [[government]],
without regard to the [[time]] that must have elapsed before the meaning
of the words [[authority]] and [[government]] could have existed among [[men]].
every one of them, in short, constantly dwelling on wants, avidity,
oppression, desires [[desire]] and [[pride]], has transferred to the [[state]] of nature
ideas which were acquired in [[society]]; so that, in speaking of the
savage, they described the social [[man]]. it has not even entered into
the heads of most of our writers to [[doubt]] whether the [[state]] of nature
ever existed; but it is clear from the holy scriptures [[scripture]] that the first
man, having received his understanding and commandments immediately
from [[god]], was not himself in such a [[state]]; and that, if we give such
credit to the writings of [[moses]] as every [[christian]] philosopher ought
to give, we must deny that, even before the deluge, [[men]] were ever in
the pure [[state]] of [[nature]]; unless, indeed, they fell back into it from
some very extraordinary circumstance; a paradox which it would be very
embarrassing to defend, and quite impossible to prove.

let us begin then by laying facts [[fact]] aside, as they do not affect the
question. the investigations we may enter into, in treating this
subject, must not be considered as historical truths [[truth]], but only as
mere conditional and hypothetical reasonings, rather calculated to
explain the [[nature]] of things, than to ascertain their actual origin;
just like the hypotheses which our physicists daily form respecting
the formation of the [[world]]. [[religion]] commands us to [[believe]] that, god
himself having taken [[men]] out of a [[state]] of [[nature]] immediately after
the creation, they are unequal only because it is his will they should
be so: but it does not forbid us to form conjectures based solely on
the [[nature]] of [[man]], and the beings around him, concerning what might
have become of the [[human]] [[race]], if it had been left to itself. this
then is the [[question]] [[asked]] me, and that which i propose to discuss in
the following discourse. as my [[subject]] interests [[mankind]] in general,
i shall endeavour to make use of a style adapted to all nations, or
rather, forgetting [[time]] and place, to attend only to [[men]] to whom i am
speaking. i shall suppose myself in the lyceum of [[athens]], repeating the
lessons of my masters, with [[plato]] and xenocrates for judges [[judge]], and the
whole [[human]] [[race]] for audience.

o [[man]], of whatever [[country]] you are, and whatever your opinions [[opinion]] may be,
behold your [[history]], such as i have [[thought]] to [[read]] it, not in books
written by your fellow-creatures, who are liars, but in [[nature]], which
never lies [[lie]]. all that comes from her will be true; nor will you meet
with anything false, unless i have involuntarily put in something of my
own. the times [[time]] of which i am going to speak are very remote: how much
are you changed from what you once were! it is so to speak, the [[life]] of
your [[species]] which i am going to write, after the qualities which you
have received, which your [[education]] and habits may have depraved, but
cannot have entirely destroyed. there is, i [[feel]], an [[age]] at which the
individual [[man]] would [[wish]] to stop; you are about to inquire about the
age at which you would have liked your whole [[species]] to stand still.
discontented with your [[present]] [[state]], for reasons [[reason]] which threaten your
unfortunate descendants with still greater discontent, you will perhaps
wish it were in your [[power]] to go back; and this feeling should be a
panegyric on your first [[ancestors]], a criticism of your contemporaries,
and a terror to the unfortunates who will come after you.




the first part


important as it may be, in order to [[judge]] rightly of the [[natural]] state
of [[man]], to consider him from his origin, and to examine him, as it
were, in the embryo of his [[species]]; i shall not [[follow]] his organisation
through its successive developments, nor shall i stay to inquire what
his animal [[system]] must have been at the beginning, in order to become
at length what it actually is. i shall not ask whether his long nails
were at first, as [[aristotle]] supposes, only crooked talons; whether
his whole [[body]], like that of a bear, was not covered with hair; or
whether the [[fact]] that he walked upon all fours, with his looks directed
toward the [[earth]], confined to a horizon of a few paces, did not at
once point out the [[nature]] and limits of his ideas [[idea]]. on this [[subject]]. i
could form none but vague and almost imaginary conjectures. comparative
anatomy has as yet made too little [[progress]], and the observations of
naturalists are too uncertain, to afford an adequate basis for any
solid reasoning. so that, without having recourse to the supernatural
information given us on this head, or paying any regard to the changes
which must have taken place in the internal, as well as the external,
conformation of [[man]], as he applied his limbs to new uses, and fed
himself on new kinds [[kind]] of food, i shall suppose his conformation to have
been at all times [[time]] what it appears to us at this day; that he always
walked on two legs, made use of his hands as we do, directed his looks
over all [[nature]], and measured with his [[eyes]] the vast expanse of [[heaven]].

if we strip this being, thus constituted, of all the supernatural gifts
he may have received, and all the artificial faculties he can have
acquired only by a long process; if we consider him, in a word, just as
he must have come from the hands of [[nature]], we behold in him an animal
weaker than some, and less agile than others; but, taking him all
round, the most advantageously organised of any. i see him satisfying
his [[hunger]] at the first oak, and slaking his thirst at the first brook;
finding his bed at the foot of the tree which afforded him a repast;
and, with that, all his wants supplied.

while the [[earth]] was left to its [[natural]] fertility and covered with
immense forests, whose trees were never mutilated by the axe, it would
present on every side both sustenance and shelter for every [[species]] of
animal. [[men]] dispersed up and down among the rest, would observe and
imitate their industry, and thus attain even to the instinct of the
beasts, with the advantage that, whereas every [[species]] of brutes was
confined to one particular instinct, [[man]], who perhaps has not any one
peculiar to himself, would appropriate them all, and [[live]] upon most of
those different foods, which other animals shared among themselves; and
thus would find his subsistence much more easily than any of the rest.

accustomed from their infancy to the inclemencies of the weather and
the rigour of the seasons, inured to fatigue, and forced, naked and
unarmed, to defend themselves and their prey from other ferocious
animals, or to escape them by flight, [[men]] would acquire a robust and
almost unalterable [[constitution]]. the [[children]], bringing with them into
the [[world]] the excellent [[constitution]] of their parents, and fortifying
it by the very exercises which first produced it, would thus acquire
all the vigour of which the [[human]] frame is capable. [[nature]] in this case
treats them exactly as sparta treated the [[children]] of her [[citizens]]:
those who come well formed into the [[world]] she renders [[strong]] and
robust, and all the rest she destroys; differing in this [[respect]] from
our [[modern]] communities [[community]], in which the [[state]], by making [[children]] a burden
to their parents, kills them indiscriminately before they are born.

the [[body]] of a savage [[man]] being the only instrument he understands, he
uses it for various purposes [[purpose]], of which ours, for want of practice, are
incapable: for our industry deprives us of that [[force]] and agility,
which necessity obliges him to acquire. if he had had an axe, would he
have been able with his naked arm to break so large a branch from a
tree? if he had had a sling, would he have been able to throw a stone
with so [[great]] velocity? if he had had a ladder, would he have been so
nimble in climbing a tree? if he had had a horse, would he have been
himself so swift of foot? give civilised [[man]] [[time]] to gather all his
machines about him, and he will no [[doubt]] easily beat the savage; but if
you would see a still more unequal contest, set them together naked
and unarmed, and you will soon see the advantage of having all our
forces constantly at our disposal, of being always prepared for every
event, and of carrying one's [[self]], as it were, perpetually whole and
entire about one.

hobbes contends that [[man]] is naturally intrepid, and is intent only
upon attacking and fighting. another illustrious philosopher holds
the opposite, and cumberland and puffendorf also affirm that nothing
is more timid and fearful than [[man]] in the [[state]] of [[nature]]; that he
is always in a tremble, and ready to fly at the least noise or the
slightest movement. this may be true of things he does not [[know]]; and i
do not [[doubt]] his being terrified by every novelty that presents [[present]] itself,
when he neither knows [[know]] the physical [[good]] or [[evil]] he may expect from it,
nor can make a comparison between his own [[strength]] and the dangers he
is about to encounter. such circumstances, however, rarely occur in a
state of [[nature]], in which all things proceed in a uniform manner, and
the face of the [[earth]] is not [[subject]] to those sudden and continual
changes which arise from the [[passions]] and caprices of bodies [[body]] of men
living together. but savage [[man]], living dispersed among other animals
and finding himself betimes in a situation to measure his strength
with theirs, soon comes to compare himself with them; and, perceiving
that he surpasses them more in adroitness than they surpass him in
strength, learns to be no longer afraid of them. set a bear, or a wolf,
against a robust, agile, and resolute savage, as they all are, armed
with stones and a [[good]] cudgel, and you will see that the danger will
be at least on both sides, and that, after a few trials of this [[kind]],
wild beasts, which are not fond of attacking each other, will not be at
all ready to attack [[man]], whom they will have found to be as wild and
ferocious as themselves. with regard to such animals as have really
more [[strength]] than [[man]] has adroitness, he is in the same situation as
all weaker animals, which notwithstanding are still able to subsist;
except indeed that he has the advantage that, being equally swift of
foot, and finding an almost [[certain]] place of refuge in every tree, he
is at [[liberty]] to take or leave it at every encounter, and thus to fight
or fly, as he chooses. add to this that it does not appear that any
animal naturally makes [[war]] on [[man]], except in case of self-defence or
excessive [[hunger]], or betrays any of those [[violent]] antipathies, which
seem to indicate that one [[species]] is intended by [[nature]] for the food of
another.

this is doubtless why negroes and savages are so little afraid of
the wild beasts they may meet in the woods. the caraibs of venezuela
among others [[live]] in this [[respect]] in absolute security and without the
smallest inconvenience. though they are almost naked, francis correal
tells us, they expose themselves freely in the woods, armed only
with bows and arrows; but no one has ever heard of one of them being
devoured by wild beasts.

but [[man]] has other enemies [[enemy]] more formidable, against which he is not
provided with such means of defence: these are the [[natural]] infirmities
of infancy, old [[age]], and illness of every [[kind]], melancholy proofs of
our weakness, of which the two first are [[common]] to all animals, and
the [[last]] belongs chiefly to [[man]] in a [[state]] of [[society]]. with regard to
infancy, it is observable that the [[mother]], carrying her child always
with her, can nurse it with much greater ease than the females of many
other animals, which are forced to be perpetually going and coming,
with [[great]] fatigue, one way to find subsistence, and another to suckle
or feed their [[young]]. it is true that if the woman happens to perish,
the infant is in [[great]] danger of perishing with her; but this risk is
common to many other [[species]] of animals, whose [[young]] take a long time
before they are able to provide for themselves. and if our infancy is
longer than theirs, our lives [[life]] are longer in proportion; so that all
things are in this [[respect]] fairly [[equal]]; though there are other rules
to be considered regarding the duration of the first period of [[life]],
and the number of [[young]], which do not affect the [[present]] [[subject]]. in
old [[age]], when [[men]] are less active and perspire little, the need for
food diminishes with the ability to provide it. as the savage state
also protects them from gout and rheumatism, and old [[age]] is, of all
ills, that which [[human]] aid can least alleviate, they cease to be,
without others perceiving that they are no more, and almost without
perceiving it themselves.

with [[respect]] to sickness, i shall not repeat the [[vain]] and false
declamations which most healthy [[people]] pronounce against medicine;
but i shall ask if any solid observations have been made from which
it may be justly concluded that, in the countries [[country]] where the art [[arts]] of
medicine is most neglected, the mean duration of man's [[man]] [[life]] is less
than in those where it is most cultivated. how indeed can this be
the case, if we bring on ourselves more diseases than medicine can
furnish remedies? the [[great]] inequality in manner of living, the extreme
idleness of some, and the excessive [[labour]] of others, the easiness
of exciting and gratifying our sensual appetites, the too exquisite
foods of the wealthy which overheat and fill them with indigestion,
and, on the other hand, the unwholesome food of the [[poor]], often, bad
as it is, insufficient for their needs, which induces them, when
opportunity offers, to [[eat]] voraciously and overcharge their stomachs;
all these, together with sitting up late, and excesses of every [[kind]],
immoderate transports of every passion, fatigue, mental exhaustion, the
innumerable pains [[pain]] and anxieties inseparable from every condition of
life, by which the [[mind]] of [[man]] is incessantly tormented; these are too
fatal proofs that the greater part of our ills are of our own making,
and that we might have avoided them nearly all by adhering to that
simple, uniform and solitary manner of [[life]] which [[nature]] prescribed.
if she destined [[man]] to be healthy, i venture to declare that a state
of reflection is a [[state]] contrary to, [[nature]], and that a thinking man
is a depraved animal. when we [[think]] of the [[good]] [[constitution]] of the
savages, at least of those whom we have not ruined with our spirituous
liquors, and reflect that they are troubled with hardly any disorders,
save wounds and old [[age]], we are tempted to [[believe]] that, in following
the [[history]] of civil [[society]], we shall be telling also that of human
sickness. such, at least, was the [[opinion]] of [[plato]], who inferred from
certain remedies prescribed, or approved, by podalirius and machaon
at the siege of troy, that several sicknesses which these remedies
gave rise to in his [[time]], were not then known to [[mankind]]: and celsus
tells us that diet, which is now so necessary, was first [[invented]] by
hippocrates.

being [[subject]] therefore to so few causes of sickness, [[man]], in the state
of [[nature]], can have no need of remedies, and still less of physicians:
nor is the [[human]] [[race]] in this [[respect]] worse off than other animals,
and it is easy to learn from hunters whether they meet with many infirm
animals in the course of the chase. it is [[certain]] they frequently meet
with such as carry the marks of having been considerably wounded, with
many that have had bones or even limbs broken, yet have been healed
without any other surgical assistance than that of [[time]], or any other
regimen than that of their ordinary [[life]]. at the same [[time]] their cures
seem not to have been less [[perfect]], for their not having been tortured
by incisions, poisoned with drugs, or wasted by fasting. in short,
however useful medicine, properly administered, may be among us, it is
certain that, if the savage, when he is sick and left to himself, has
nothing to [[hope]] but from [[nature]], he has, on the other hand, nothing to
fear but from his disease; which renders his situation often preferable
to our own.

we should beware, therefore, of confounding the savage [[man]] with the
men we have daily before our [[eyes]]. [[nature]] treats all the animals left
to her [[care]] with a predilection that seems to show how [[jealous]] she
is of that [[right]]. the horse, the cat, the bull, and even the ass are
generally of greater stature, and always more robust, and have more
vigour, [[strength]] and [[courage]], when they run wild in the forests than
when bred in the stall. by becoming domesticated, they lose half these
advantages; and it seems as if all our [[care]] to feed and treat them well
serves only to deprave them. it is thus with [[man]] also: as he becomes
sociable and a [[slave]], he grows [[weak]], timid and servile; his effeminate
way of [[life]] totally enervates his [[strength]] and [[courage]]. to this it may
be added that there is still a greater difference between savage and
civilised [[man]], than between wild and tame beasts: for [[men]] and brutes
having been treated alike by [[nature]], the several conveniences in which
men indulge themselves still more than they do their beasts, are so
many additional causes of their deeper degeneracy.

it is not therefore so [[great]] a misfortune to these primitive [[men]], nor
so [[great]] an obstacle to their preservation, that they go naked, have no
dwellings and lack all the superfluities which we [[think]] so necessary.
if their skins are not covered with hair, they have no need of such
covering in warm climates; and, in cold countries [[country]], they soon learn
to appropriate the skins of the beasts they have overcome. if they
have but two legs to run with, they have two arms to defend themselves
with, and provide for their wants. their [[children]] are slowly and with
difficulty taught to walk; but their mothers [[mother]] are able to carry them
with ease; advantage which other animals lack, as the [[mother]], if
pursued, is forced either to abandon her [[young]], or to regulate her
pace by theirs. unless, in short, we suppose a singular and fortuitous
concurrence of circumstances of which i shall speak later, and
which would be unlikely to [[exist]], it is plain in every [[state]] of the
case, that the [[man]] who first made himself clothes or a dwelling was
furnishing himself with things not at all necessary; for he had till
then done without them, and there is no [[reason]] why he should not have
been able to put up in manhood with the same [[kind]] of [[life]] as had been
his in infancy.

solitary, indolent, and perpetually accompanied by danger, the savage
cannot but be fond of sleep; his sleep too must be [[light]], like that of
the animals, which [[think]] but little and may be said to slumber all the
time they do not [[think]]. self-preservation being his [[chief]] and almost
sole concern, he must exercise most those faculties which are most
concerned with attack or defence, either for overcoming his prey, or
for preventing him from becoming the prey of other animals. on the
other hand, those organs which are perfected only by softness and
sensuality will remain in a gross and imperfect [[state]], incompatible
with any sort of delicacy; so that, his senses being divided on this
head, his touch and taste will be extremely coarse, his sight, hearing
and smell exceedingly fine and subtle. such in general is the animal
condition, and such, according to the narratives of travellers, is that
of most savage nations. it is therefore no matter for surprise that
the hottentots of the cape of [[good]] [[hope]] distinguish ships at sea, with
the naked eye, at as [[great]] a distance as the dutch can do with their
telescopes; or that the savages of [[america]] should trace the spaniards,
by their smell, as well as the [[best]] dogs could have done; or that
these barbarous peoples [[people]] [[feel]] no [[pain]] in going naked, or that they use
large quantities of piemento with their food, and drink the strongest
european liquors like water.

hitherto i have considered merely the physical [[man]]; let us now take a
view of him on his metaphysical and [[moral]] side.

i see nothing in any animal but an ingenious machine, to which nature
hath given senses to wind itself up, and to guard itself, to a certain
degree, against anything that might tend to disorder or [[destroy]] it.
i perceive exactly the same things in the [[human]] machine, with this
difference, that in the operations of the brute, [[nature]] is the sole
agent, whereas [[man]] has some share in his own operations, in his
character as a [[free]] agent. the one chooses and refuses by instinct, the
other from an act of free-will: hence the brute cannot deviate from the
rule prescribed to it, even when it would be advantageous for it to do
so; and, on the contrary, [[man]] frequently deviates from such rules [[rule]] to
his own prejudice. thus a pigeon would be starved to [[death]] by the side
of a dish of the choicest meats, and a cat on a heap of fruit or grain;
though it is [[certain]] that either might find nourishment in the foods
which it thus rejects with disdain, did it [[think]] of trying them. hence
it is that dissolute [[men]] run into excesses which bring on fevers and
death; because the [[mind]] depraves the senses, and the will continues to
speak when [[nature]] is silent.

every animal has ideas [[idea]], since it has senses; it even combines those
ideas in a [[certain]] [[degree]]; and it is only in [[degree]] that [[man]] differs,
in this [[respect]], from the brute. some [[philosophers]] have even maintained
that there is a greater difference between one [[man]] and another than
between some [[men]] and some beasts. it is not, therefore, so much the
understanding that constitutes the specific difference between the man
and the brute, as the [[human]] quality of free-agency. [[nature]] lays her
commands on every animal, and the brute obeys her voice. [[man]] receives
the same impulsion, but at the same [[time]] knows [[know]] himself at liberty
to acquiesce or resist: and it is particularly in his consciousness
of this [[liberty]] that the spirituality of his [[soul]] is displayed. for
physics may explain, in some measure, the mechanism of the senses
and the formation of ideas [[idea]]; but in the [[power]] of willing or rather of
choosing, and in the feeling of this [[power]], nothing is to be found but
acts which are purely [[spiritual]] and wholly inexplicable by the laws [[law]] of
mechanism.

however, even if the difficulties attending all these questions
should still leave room for difference in this [[respect]] between [[men]] and
brutes, there is another very specific quality which distinguishes
them, and which will admit of no dispute. this is the faculty of
self-improvement, which, by the [[help]] of circumstances, gradually
develops all the rest of our faculties, and is inherent in the species
as in the [[individual]]: whereas a brute is, at the end of a few months,
all he will ever be during his whole [[life]], and his [[species]], at the
end of a thousand years, exactly what it was the first year of that
thousand. why is [[man]] alone liable to grow into a dotard? is it not
because he returns, in this, to his primitive [[state]]; and that, while
the brute, which has acquired nothing and has therefore nothing to
lose, still retains the [[force]] of instinct, [[man]], who loses, by age
or accident, all that his _perfectibility_ had enabled him to gain,
falls by this means lower than the brutes themselves? it would be
melancholy, were we forced to admit that this distinctive and almost
unlimited faculty is the source of all [[human]] misfortunes; that it is
this which, in [[time]], draws [[man]] out of his original [[state]], in which
he would have spent his days insensibly in [[peace]] and innocence; that
it is this faculty, which, successively producing in different ages
his discoveries and his errors, his vices [[vice]] and his virtues [[virtue]], makes him
at length a [[tyrant]] both over himself and over [[nature]].[1] it would be
shocking to be obliged to regard as a benefactor the [[man]] who first
suggested to the oroonoko indians [[indian]] the use of the boards they apply to
the temples of their [[children]], which secure to them some part at least
of their imbecility and original [[happiness]].

savage [[man]], left by [[nature]] solely to the direction of instinct, or
rather indemnified for what he may lack by faculties capable at first
of supplying its place, and afterwards of raising him much above it,
must accordingly begin with purely animal functions: thus seeing and
feeling must be his first condition, which would be [[common]] to him and
all other animals. to will, and not to will, to [[desire]] and to [[fear]],
must be the first, and almost the only operations of his [[soul]], till new
circumstances [[occasion]] new developments of his faculties.

whatever moralists may hold, the [[human]] understanding is greatly
indebted to the [[passions]], which, it is universally allowed, are also
much indebted to the understanding. it is by the activity of the
passions that pur [[reason]] is improved; for we [[desire]] [[knowledge]] only
because we [[wish]] to enjoy; and it is impossible to conceive any reason
why a [[person]] who has neither fears [[fear]] nor desires [[desire]] should give himself the
trouble of reasoning. the [[passions]], again, originate in our wants,
and their [[progress]] depends on that of our [[knowledge]]; for we cannot
desire or [[fear]] anything, except from the [[idea]] we have of it, or from
the simple impulse of [[nature]]. now savage [[man]], being destitute of every
species of [[intelligence]], can have no [[passions]] save those of the latter
kind: his desires [[desire]] never go beyond his physical wants. the only goods
he recognises in the [[universe]] are food, a female, and sleep: the only
evils he fears [[fear]] are [[pain]] and [[hunger]]. i say [[pain]], and not [[death]]: for
no animal can [[know]] what it is to [[die]]; the [[knowledge]] of [[death]] and its
terrors being one of the first acquisitions made by [[man]] in departing
from an animal [[state]].

it would be easy, were it necessary, to support this [[opinion]] by facts [[fact]],
and to show that, in all the nations of the [[world]], the progress
of the understanding has been exactly proportionate to the wants
which the peoples [[people]] had received from [[nature]], or been subjected to by
circumstances, and in consequence to the [[passions]] that induced them to
provide for those necessities. i might instance the [[arts]], rising up in
egypt and expanding with the inundation of the nile. i might follow
their [[progress]] into greece, where they took root afresh, grew up and
towered to the skies [[sky]], among the rocks and sands of attica, without
being able to germinate on the fertile banks of the eurotas: i might
observe that in general, the [[people]] of the north are more industrious
than those of the south, because they cannot get on so well without
being so: as if [[nature]] wanted to equalise matters by giving their
understandings the fertility she had refused to their soil.

but who does not see, without recurring to the uncertain testimony
of [[history]], that everything seems to remove from savage [[man]] both the
temptation and the means of changing his condition? his imagination
paints no pictures; his [[heart]] makes no demands on him. his few wants
are so readily supplied, and he is so far from having the knowledge
which is needful to make him want more, that he can have neither
foresight nor curiosity. the face of [[nature]] becomes indifferent to
him as it grows familiar. he sees in it always the same order, the
same successions: he has not understanding enough to wonder at the
greatest [[miracles]]; nor is it in his [[mind]] that we can expect to find
that [[philosophy]] [[man]] needs, if he is to [[know]] how to notice for once what
he sees every day. his [[soul]], which nothing disturbs, is wholly wrapped
up in the feeling of its [[present]] existence, without any [[idea]] of the
future, however near at hand; while his projects, as limited as his
views, hardly extend to the close of day. such, even at [[present]], is the
extent of the native caribean's foresight: he will improvidently sell
you his cotton-bed in the morning, and come crying in the evening to
buy it again, not having foreseen he would want it again the next night.

the more we reflect on this [[subject]], the greater appears the distance
between pure sensation and the most simple [[knowledge]]: it is impossible
indeed to conceive how a [[man]], by his own powers [[power]] alone, without the aid
of communication and the spur of necessity, could have bridged so great
a gap. how many ages [[age]] may have elapsed before [[mankind]] were in a position
to behold any other are than that of the heavens [[heaven]]. what a multiplicity
of chances [[chance]] must have happened to [[teach]] them the commonest uses of that
element! how often must they have let it out before they acquired the
art of reproducing it? and how often may not such a secret have died
with him who had discovered it? what shall we say of agriculture, an
art which requires so much [[labour]] and foresight, which is so dependent
on others that it is plain it could only be practised in a society
which had at least begun, and which does not serve so much to draw
the means of subsistence from the earth--for these it would produce
of itself--but to compel it to [[produce]] what is most to our taste? but
let us suppose that [[men]] had so multiplied that the [[natural]] [[produce]] of
the [[earth]] was no longer sufficient for their support; a supposition,
by the way, which would prove such a [[life]] to be very advantageous for
the [[human]] [[race]]; let us suppose that, without forges or workshops, the
instruments of husbandry had dropped from the [[sky]] into the hands of
savages; that they had overcome their [[natural]] aversion to continual
labour; that they had learnt so much foresight for their needs; that
they had divined how to cultivate the [[earth]], to sow grain and plant
trees; that they had discovered the [[arts]] of grinding corn, and of
setting the grape to ferment--all being things that must have been
taught them by the gods, since it is not to be conceived how they
could discover them for themselves--yet after all this, what [[man]] among
them would be so absurd as to take the trouble of cultivating a field,
which might be stripped of its crop by the first comer, [[man]] or beast,
that might take a liking to it; and how should each of them resolve to
pass his [[life]] in wearisome [[labour]], when, the more necessary to him the
reward of his [[labour]] might be, the surer he would be of not getting
it? in a word, how could such a situation induce [[men]] to cultivate the
earth, till it was regularly parcelled out among them; that is to say,
till the [[state]] of [[nature]] had been abolished?

were we to suppose savage [[man]] as trained in the art [[arts]] of thinking as
philosophers make him; were we, like them, to suppose him a very
philosopher capable of investigating the sublimest truths [[truth]], and of
forming, by highly abstract chains of reasoning, maxims [[maxim]] of [[reason]] and
justice, deduced from the [[love]] of order in general, or the known will
of his creator; in a word, were we to suppose him as [[intelligent]] and
enlightened, as he must have been, and is in [[fact]] found to have been,
dull and stupid, what advantage would accrue to the [[species]], from all
such metaphysics, which could not be communicated by one to another,
but must end with him who made them? what [[progress]] could be made by
mankind, while dispersed in the woods among other animals? and how far
could [[men]] improve or mutually enlighten one another, when, having no
fixed habitation, and no need of one another's assistance, the same
persons hardly met twice in their lives [[life]], and perhaps then, without
knowing one another or speaking together?

let it be considered how many ideas [[idea]] we owe to the use of [[speech]]; how
far grammar exercises the understanding and facilitates its operations.
let us reflect on the inconceivable pains [[pain]] and the infinite space of
time that the first invention of languages [[language]] must have cost. to these
reflections add what preceded, and then [[judge]] how many thousand ages
must have elapsed in the successive [[development]] in the [[human]] [[mind]] of
those operations of which it is capable.

i shall here take the [[liberty]] for a moment, of considering the
difficulties of the origin of languages [[language]], on which [[subject]] i might
content myself with a simple repetition of the abbé condillac's
investigations, as they fully confirm my [[system]], and perhaps even
first suggested it. but it is plain, from the manner in which this
philosopher solves the difficulties he himself raises, concerning the
origin of arbitrary signs, that he assumes what i [[question]], viz. that
a [[kind]] of [[society]], must already have existed among the first inventors
of [[language]]. while i refer, therefore, to his observations on this
head, i [[think]] it [[right]] to give my own, in order to exhibit the same
difficulties in a [[light]] adapted to my [[subject]]. the first which presents
itself is to conceive how [[language]] can have become necessary; for
as there was no communication among [[men]] and no need for any, we can
neither conceive the necessity of this invention, nor the possibility
of it, if it was not somehow indispensable. i might affirm, with many
others, that languages [[language]] arose in the domestic intercourse between
parents and their [[children]]. but this expedient would not obviate the
difficulty, and would besides involve the blunder made by those who, in
reasoning on the [[state]] of [[nature]], always import into it ideas [[idea]] gathered
in a [[state]] of [[society]]. thus they constantly consider families [[family]] as living
together under one roof, and the individuals [[individual]] of each as observing among
themselves a union as intimate and permanent as that which exists
among us, where so many [[common]] interests unite them: whereas, in this
primitive [[state]], [[men]] had neither houses, nor huts, nor any [[kind]] of
property whatever; every one lived where he could, seldom for more
than a [[single]] night; the sexes [[sex]] [[united]] without design, as accident,
opportunity or inclination brought them together, nor had they any
great need of words to communicate their designs to each other; and
they parted with the same indifference. the [[mother]] gave suck to her
children at first for her own sake; and afterwards, when habit had
made them dear, for theirs: but as soon as they were [[strong]] enough to
go in search of their own food, they forsook her of their own accord;
and, as they had hardly any other method of not losing one another
than that of remaining continually within sight, they soon became quite
incapable of recognising one another when they happened to meet again.
it is farther to be observed that the child, having all his wants to
explain, and of course more to say to his [[mother]] than the [[mother]] could
have to say to him, must have borne the brunt of the task of invention,
and the [[language]] he used would be of his own device, so that the number
of languages [[language]] would be [[equal]] to that of the individuals [[individual]] speaking them,
and the variety would be increased by the vagabond and roving [[life]] they
led, which would not give [[time]] for any idiom to become constant. for to
say that the [[mother]] dictated to her child the words he was to use in
asking her for one thing or another, is an explanation of how languages
already formed are taught, but by no means explains how languages [[language]] were
originally formed.

we will suppose, however, that this first difficulty is obviated. let
us for a moment then take ourselves as being on this side of the vast
space which must [[lie]] between a pure [[state]] of [[nature]] and that in which
languages had become necessary, and, admitting their necessity, let
us inquire how they could first be established. here we have a new
and worse difficulty to grapple with; for if [[men]] need [[speech]] to learn
to [[think]], they must have stood in much greater need of the art [[arts]] of
thinking, to be able to invent that of speaking. and though we might
conceive how the articulate sounds of the voice came to be taken as
the conventional interpreters of our ideas [[idea]], it would still remain for
us to inquire what could have been the interpreters of this convention
for those ideas [[idea]], which, answering to no sensible objects, could not be
indicated either by gesture or voice; so that we can hardly form any
tolerable conjectures about the origin of this art [[arts]] of communicating our
thoughts and establishing a correspondence between minds [[mind]]: an art [[arts]] so
sublime, that far distant as it is from its origin, [[philosophers]] still
behold it at such an immeasurable distance from [[perfection]], that there
is none rash enough to affirm it will ever reach it, even though the
revolutions [[time]] necessarily produces [[produce]] were suspended in its favour,
though prejudice should be [[banished]] from our academies or condemned
to [[silence]], and those learned societies [[society]] should devote themselves
uninterruptedly for whole ages [[age]] to this thorny [[question]].

the first [[language]] of [[mankind]], the most universal and vivid, in a
word the only [[language]] [[man]] needed, before he had [[occasion]] to exert
his eloquence to persuade assembled multitudes, was the simple cry of
nature. but as this was excited only by a sort of instinct on urgent
occasions, to implore assistance in case of danger, or relief in case
of suffering, it could be of little use in the ordinary course of [[life]],
in which more moderate feelings prevail. when the ideas [[idea]] of [[men]] began to
expand and multiply, and closer communication took place among them,
they strove to invent more numerous signs and a more copious [[language]].
they multiplied the inflections of the voice, and added gestures,
which are in their own [[nature]] more expressive, and depend less for
their meaning on a prior determination. visible and movable objects
were therefore expressed by gestures, and audible ones by imitative
sounds: but, as hardly anything can be indicated by gestures, except
objects actually [[present]] or easily described, and visible actions; as
they are not universally useful--for darkness or the interposition
of a material object destroys their efficacy--and as besides they
rather request than secure our attention; [[men]] at length bethought
themselves of substituting for them the articulate sounds of the voice,
which, without bearing the same relation to any particular ideas [[idea]], are
better calculated to express them all, as conventional signs. such an
institution could only be made by [[common]] [[consent]], and must have been
effected in a manner not very easy for [[men]] whose gross organs had not
been accustomed to any such exercise. it is also in itself still more
difficult to conceive, since such a [[common]] agreement must have had
motives, and [[speech]] seems to have been highly necessary to establish
the use of it.

it is reasonable to suppose that the words first made use of by mankind
had a much more extensive signification than those used in languages
already formed, and that ignorant as they were of the division of
discourse into its constituent parts, they at first gave every single
word the sense of a whole proposition. when they began to distinguish
subject and attribute, and noun and verb, which was itself no common
effort of genius, substantives were at first only so many proper
names; the [[present]] infinitive was the only tense of verbs; and the very
idea of adjectives must have been developed with [[great]] difficulty; for
every adjective is an abstract [[idea]], and abstractions are painful and
unnatural operations.

every object at first received a particular name without regard to
genus or [[species]], which these primitive originators were not in a
position to distinguish; every [[individual]] presented itself to their
minds in isolation, as they are in the picture of [[nature]]. if one oak
was called a, another was called b; for the primitive [[idea]] of two
things is that they are not the same, and it often takes a long time
for what they have in [[common]] to be seen: so that, the narrower the
limits of their [[knowledge]] of things, the more copious their dictionary
must have been. the difficulty of using such a vocabulary could not
be easily removed; for, to arrange beings under [[common]] and generic
denominations, it became necessary to [[know]] their distinguishing
properties: the need arose for observation and definition, that is to
say, for [[natural]] [[history]] and metaphysics of a far more developed kind
than [[men]] can at that [[time]] have possessed.

add to this, that general ideas [[idea]] cannot be introduced into the mind
without the assistance of words, nor can the understanding seize
them except by means of propositions. this is one of the reasons [[reason]] why
animals cannot form such ideas [[idea]], or ever acquire that capacity for
self-improvement which depends on them. when a monkey goes from one nut
to another, are we to conceive that he entertains any general [[idea]] of
that [[kind]] of fruit, and compares its archetype with the two individual
nuts? assuredly he does not; but the sight of one of these nuts recalls
to his memory the sensations which he received from the other, and his
eyes, being modified after a [[certain]] manner, give information to the
palate of the modification it is about to receive. every general idea
is purely intellectual; if the [[imagination]] meddles with it ever so
little, the [[idea]] immediately becomes particular. if you endeavour to
trace in your [[mind]] the image of a tree in general, you never attain to
your end. in spite of all you can do, you will have to see it as great
or little, bare or leafy, [[light]] or dark, and were you capable of seeing
nothing in it but what is [[common]] to all trees, it would no longer be
like a tree at all. purely abstract beings are perceivable in the same
manner, or are only conceivable by the [[help]] of [[language]]. the definition
of a triangle alone gives you a true [[idea]] of it: the moment you imagine
a triangle in your [[mind]], it is some particular triangle and not
another, and you cannot avoid giving it sensible lines and a coloured
area. we must then make use of propositions and of [[language]] in order to
form general ideas [[idea]]. for no sooner does the [[imagination]] cease to operate
than the understanding proceeds only by the [[help]] of words. if then the
first inventors of [[speech]] could give names only to ideas [[idea]] they already
had, it follows that the first substantives could be nothing more than
proper names.

but when our new grammarians, by means of which i have no conception,
began to extend their ideas [[idea]] and generalise their terms, the ignorance
of the inventors must have confined this method within very narrow
limits; and, as they had at first gone too far in multiplying the names
of individuals [[individual]], from ignorance of their genus and [[species]], they made
afterwards too few of these, from not having considered beings in all
their specific differences. it would indeed have needed more knowledge
and [[experience]] than they could have, and more pains [[pain]] and inquiry than
they would have bestowed, to carry these distinctions to their proper
length. if, even to-day, we are continually discovering new [[species]],
which have hitherto escaped observation, let us reflect how many of
them must have escaped [[men]] who judged things merely from their first
appearance! it is superfluous to add that the primitive classes and
the most general notions must necessarily have escaped their notice
also. how, for instance, could they have understood or [[thought]] of the
words matter, spirit, substance, mode, figure, motion, when even our
philosophers, who have so long been making use of them, have themselves
the [[greatest]] difficulty in understanding them; and when, the ideas
attached to them being purely metaphysical, there are no models of them
to be found in [[nature]]?

but i stop at this point, and ask my judges [[judge]] to suspend their reading
a while, to consider, after the invention of physical substantives,
which is the easiest part of [[language]] to invent, that there is still a
great way to go, before the thoughts [[thought]] of [[men]] will have found perfect
expression and constant form, such as would [[answer]] the purposes [[purpose]] of
public speaking, and [[produce]] their effect on [[society]]. i beg of them to
consider how much [[time]] must have been spent, and how much knowledge
needed, to find out numbers, abstract terms, aorists and all the tenses
of verbs, particles, syntax, the method of connecting propositions,
the forms of reasoning, and all the [[logic]] of [[speech]]. for myself, i am
so aghast at the increasing difficulties which [[present]] themselves,
and so well convinced of the almost demonstrable impossibility that
languages should owe their original institution to merely [[human]] means,
that i leave, to any one who will undertake it, the discussion of
the difficult problem, which was most necessary, the existence of
society to the invention of [[language]], or the invention of language
to the establishment of [[society]]. but be the origin of [[language]] and
society what they may, it may be at least inferred, from the little
care which [[nature]] has taken to unite [[mankind]] by mutual wants, and to
facilitate the use of [[speech]], that she has contributed little to make
them sociable, and has put little of her own into all they have done
to create such bonds of union. it is in [[fact]] impossible to conceive
why, in a [[state]] of [[nature]], one [[man]] should stand more in need of the
assistance of another, than a monkey or a wolf of the assistance of
another of its [[kind]]: or, granting that he did, what motives could
induce that other to assist him; or, even then, by what means they
could agree about the conditions. i [[know]] it is incessantly repeated
that [[man]] would in such a [[state]] have been the most miserable of
creatures; and indeed, if it be true, as i [[think]] i have proved, that
he must have lived many ages [[age]], before he could have either [[desire]] or
an opportunity of emerging from it, this would only be an accusation
against [[nature]], and not against the being which she had thus unhappily
constituted. but as i [[understand]] the word _miserable_, it either has
no meaning at all, or else signifies only a painful privation of
something, or a [[state]] of suffering either in [[body]] or [[soul]]. i should be
glad to have explained to me, what [[kind]] of misery a [[free]] being, whose
heart is at ease and whose [[body]] is in health, can possibly suffer. i
would ask also, whether a social or a [[natural]] [[life]] is most likely to
become insupportable to those who enjoy it. we see around us hardly a
creature in civil [[society]], who does not lament his existence: we even
see many deprive themselves of as much of it as they can, and laws
human and [[divine]] together can hardly put a stop to the disorder. i
ask, if it was ever known that a savage took it into his head, when
at [[liberty]], to [[complain]] of [[life]] or to make away with himself. let us
therefore [[judge]], with less vanity, on which side the real misery is
found. on the other hand, nothing could be more unhappy than savage
man, dazzled by [[science]], tormented by his [[passions]], and reasoning about
a [[state]] different from his own. it appears that providence most wisely
determined that the faculties, which he potentially possessed, should
develop themselves only as [[occasion]] offered to exercise them, in order
that they might not be superfluous or perplexing to him, by appearing
before their [[time]], nor slow and useless when the need for them arose.
in instinct alone, he had all he required for living in the [[state]] of
nature; and with a developed understanding he has only just enough to
support [[life]] in [[society]].

it appears, at first view, that [[men]] in a [[state]] of [[nature]], having no
moral relations or determinate obligations one with another, could
not be either [[good]] nor [[bad]], [[virtuous]] or vicious; unless we take these
terms in a physical sense, and call, in an [[individual]], those qualities
vices which may be injurious to his preservation, and those virtues
which contribute to it; in which case, he would have to be accounted
most [[virtuous]], who put least check on the pure impulses of [[nature]].
but without deviating from the ordinary sense of the words, it will
be proper to suspend the [[judgment]] we might be [[led]] to form on such a
state, and be on our guard against our prejudices, till we have weighed
the matter in the scales of impartiality, and seen whether virtues
or vices [[vice]] preponderate among civilised [[men]]; and whether their virtues
do them more [[good]] than their vices [[vice]] do harm; till we have discovered,
whether the [[progress]] of the sciences [[science]] sufficiently indemnifies them for
the mischiefs they do one another, in proportion as they are better
informed of the [[good]] they ought to do; or whether they would not be,
on the whole, in a much happier condition if they had nothing to fear
or to [[hope]] from any one, than as they are, subjected to universal
dependence, and obliged to take everything from those who engage to
give them nothing in return.

above all, let us not conclude, with hobbes, that because [[man]] has no
idea of goodness, he must be naturally wicked; that he is vicious
because he does not [[know]] [[virtue]]; that he always refuses to do his
fellow-creatures services which he does not [[think]] they have a
right to demand; or that by [[virtue]] of the [[right]] he truly claims to
everything he needs, he foolishly imagines himself the sole proprietor
of the whole [[universe]]. hobbes had seen clearly the defects of all
the [[modern]] definitions of [[natural]] [[right]]: but the consequences which
he deduces from his own show that he understands it in an equally
false sense. in reasoning on the principles [[principle]] he lays down, he ought
to have said that the [[state]] of [[nature]], being that in which the care
for our own preservation is the least prejudicial to that of others,
was consequently the [[best]] calculated to promote [[peace]], and the most
suitable for [[mankind]]. he does say the exact opposite, in consequence
of having improperly admitted, as a part of savage man's [[man]] [[care]] for
self-preservation, the gratification of a multitude of [[passions]] which
are the [[work]] of [[society]], and have made laws [[law]] necessary. a [[bad]] [[man]], he
says, is a robust child. but it remains to be proved whether [[man]] in
a [[state]] of [[nature]] is this robust child: and, should we grant that he
is, what would he infer? why truly, that if this [[man]], when robust and
strong, were dependent on others as he is when feeble, there is no
extravagance he would not be guilty of; that he would beat his mother
when she was too slow in giving him her breast; that he would strangle
one of his younger brothers [[brother]], if he should be troublesome to him, or
bite the arm of another, if he put him to any inconvenience. but that
man in the [[state]] of [[nature]] is both [[strong]] and dependent involves two
contrary suppositions. [[man]] is [[weak]] when he is dependent, and is his
own master before he comes to be [[strong]]. hobbes did not reflect that
the same cause, which prevents a savage from making use of his [[reason]],
as our jurists hold, prevents him also from abusing his faculties, as
hobbes himself allows: so that it may be justly said that savages are
not [[bad]] merely because they do not [[know]] what it is to be [[good]]: for it
is neither the [[development]] of the understanding nor the restraint
of [[law]] that hinders them from doing ill; but the peacefulness of
their [[passions]], and their ignorance of [[vice]]: _tanto plus in illis
proficit vitiorum ignoratio, quam in his cognitio virtutis_.[2] there
is another [[principle]] which has escaped hobbes; which, having been
bestowed on [[mankind]], to moderate, on [[certain]] occasions [[occasion]], the impetuosity
of egoism, or, before its birth, the [[desire]] of self-preservation,
tempers the ardour with which he pursues his own welfare, by an innate
repugnance at seeing a fellow-creature suffer.[3] i [[think]] i need not
fear contradiction in holding [[man]] to be possessed of the only natural
virtue, which could not be denied him by the most [[violent]] detractor
of [[human]] [[virtue]]. i am speaking of compassion which is a disposition
suitable to creatures so [[weak]] and [[subject]] to so many evils [[evil]] as we
certainly are: by so much the more universal and useful to [[mankind]],
as it comes before any [[kind]] of reflection; and at the same [[time]] so
natural, that the very brutes themselves sometimes give evident proofs
of it. not to mention the tenderness of mothers [[mother]] for their offspring and
the perils they encounter to save them from danger, it is well known
that horses show a reluctance to trample on living bodies [[body]]. one animal
never passes by the [[dead]] [[body]] of another of its [[species]]: there are even
some which give their fellows a sort of burial; while the mournful
lowings of the cattle when they enter the slaughter-house show the
impressions made on them by the horrible spectacle which meets them.
we find, with [[pleasure]], the author of the fable of the bees obliged to
own that [[man]] is a compassionate and sensible being, and laying aside
his cold subtlety of style, in the [[example]] he gives, to [[present]] us with
the pathetic description of a [[man]] who, from a place of confinement,
is compelled to behold a wild beast tear a child from the arms of its
mother, grinding its tender limbs with its murderous teeth, and tearing
its palpitating entrails with its claws. what horrid agitation must
not the eye-witness of such a scene [[experience]], although he would not
be personally concerned! what [[anxiety]] would he not suffer at not being
able to give any assistance to the fainting [[mother]] and the dying infant!

such is the pure emotion of [[nature]], prior to all kinds [[kind]] of reflection!
such is the [[force]] of [[natural]] compassion, which the [[greatest]] depravity
of morals [[moral]] has as yet hardly been able to destroy! for we daily find
at our theatres [[men]] affected, nay shedding tears at the sufferings of
a wretch who, were he in the tyrant's place, would probably even add
to the torments of his enemies [[enemy]]; like the bloodthirsty sulla, who was
so sensitive to ills he had not caused, or that alexander of pheros
who did not dare to go and see any tragedy acted, for [[fear]] of being
seen weeping with andromache and priam, though he could listen without
emotion to the cries of all the [[citizens]] who were daily strangled at
his command.


                   _mollissima corda_
    _humano generi dare se natura fatetur,_
    _qua lacrimas dedit._
                     juvenal, satire xv, 151.[4]



mandeville well knew that, in spite of all their morality, [[men]] would
have never been [[better]] than monsters, had not [[nature]] bestowed on them
a sense of compassion, to aid their [[reason]]: but he did not see that
from this quality alone flow all those social virtues [[virtue]], of which he
denied [[man]] the possession. but what is generosity, clemency or humanity
but compassion applied to the [[weak]], to the guilty, or to [[mankind]] in
general? even benevolence and [[friendship]] are, if we [[judge]] rightly, only
the effects of compassion, constantly set upon a particular object: for
how is it different to [[wish]] that another [[person]] may not suffer pain
and uneasiness and to [[wish]] him [[happy]]? were it even true that [[pity]] is
no more than a feeling, which puts us in the place of the sufferer,
a feeling, obscure yet lively in a savage, developed yet feeble in
civilised [[man]]; this [[truth]] would have no other consequence than to
confirm my argument. compassion must, in [[fact]], be the stronger, the
more the animal beholding any [[kind]] of distress identifies himself with
the animal that suffers. now, it is plain that such identification
must have been much more [[perfect]] in a [[state]] of [[nature]] than it is in
a [[state]] of [[reason]]. it is [[reason]] that engenders self-respect, and
reflection that confirms it: it is [[reason]] which turns man's [[man]] [[mind]] back
upon itself, and divides him from everything that could disturb or
afflict him. it is [[philosophy]] that isolates him, and bids him say, at
sight of the misfortunes of others: "perish if you will, i am secure."
nothing but such general evils [[evil]] as threaten the whole [[community]] can
disturb the tranquil sleep of the philosopher, or tear him from his
bed. a murder may with impunity be committed under his window; he has
only to put his hands to his ears and argue a little with himself, to
prevent [[nature]], which is shocked within him, from identifying itself
with the unfortunate sufferer. uncivilised [[man]] has not this admirable
talent; and for want of [[reason]] and [[wisdom]], is always foolishly ready to
obey the first promptings of [[humanity]]. it is the populace that flocks
together at riots and street-brawls, while the [[wise]] [[man]] prudently makes
off. it is the mob and the market-women, who part the combatants, and
hinder gentle-folks from cutting one another's throats.

it is then [[certain]] that compassion is a [[natural]] feeling which, by
moderating the [[violence]] of [[love]] of [[self]] in each [[individual]], contributes
to the preservation of the whole [[species]]. it is this compassion that
hurries us without reflection to the relief of those who are in
distress: it is this which in a [[state]] of [[nature]] supplies the place of
laws, morals [[moral]] and virtues [[virtue]], with the advantage that none are tempted to
disobey its gentle voice: it is this which will always prevent a sturdy
savage from robbing a [[weak]] child or a feeble old [[man]] of the sustenance
they may have with [[pain]] and difficulty acquired, if he sees a
possibility of providing for himself by other means: it is this which,
instead of inculcating that sublime [[maxim]] of [[rational]] [[justice]], _do to
others as you would have them do unto you,_ inspires all [[men]] with that
other [[maxim]] of [[natural]] goodness, much less [[perfect]] indeed, but perhaps
more useful; _do [[good]] to yourself with as little [[evil]] as possible to
others._ in a word, it is rather in this [[natural]] feeling than in any
subtle arguments that we must look for the cause of that repugnance,
which every [[man]] would [[experience]] in doing [[evil]], even independently of
the maxims [[maxim]] of [[education]]. although it might belong to [[socrates]] and other
minds of the like craft to acquire [[virtue]] by [[reason]], the [[human]] race
would long since have ceased to be, had its preservation depended only
on the reasonings of the individuals [[individual]] composing it.

with [[passions]] so little active, and so [[good]] a curb, [[men]], being rather
wild than wicked, and more intent to guard themselves against the
mischief that might be done them, than to do mischief to others, were
by no means [[subject]] to very perilous dissensions. they maintained no
kind of intercourse with one another, and were consequently strangers
to vanity, deference, esteem and contempt; they had not the least
idea of _meum_ and _tuum_, and no true conception of [[justice]]; they
looked upon every [[violence]] to which they were subjected, rather as an
injury that might easily be repaired than as a crime that ought to be
punished; and they never [[thought]] of taking [[revenge]], unless perhaps
mechanically and on the spot, as a dog will sometimes bite the stone
which is thrown at him. their quarrels therefore would seldom have
very bloody consequences; for the [[subject]] of them would be merely the
question of subsistence. but i am aware of one greater danger, which
remains to be noticed.

of the [[passions]] that stir the [[heart]] of [[man]], there is one which
makes the sexes [[sex]] necessary to each other, and is extremely ardent
and impetuous; a terrible passion that braves danger, surmounts all
obstacles, and in its transports seems calculated to bring destruction
on the [[human]] [[race]] which it is really destined to preserve. what must
become of [[men]] who are left to this brutal and boundless rage, without
modesty, without shame, and daily upholding their amours at the price
of their [[blood]]?

it must, in the first place, be allowed that, the more [[violent]] the
passions are, the more are laws [[law]] necessary to keep them under restraint.
but, setting aside the inadequacy of laws [[law]] to effect this [[purpose]], which
is evident from the crimes and disorders to which these [[passions]] daily
give rise among us, we should do well to inquire if these evils [[evil]] did not
spring up with the laws [[law]] themselves; for in this case, even if the laws
were capable of repressing such evils [[evil]], it is the least that could be
expected from them, that they should check a mischief which would not
have arisen without them.

let us begin by distinguishing between the physical and moral
ingredients in the feeling of [[love]]. the physical part of [[love]] is that
general [[desire]] which urges the sexes [[sex]] to union with each other. the
moral part is that which determines and fixes this [[desire]] exclusively
upon one particular object; or at least gives it a greater [[degree]] of
energy toward the object thus preferred. it is easy to see that the
moral part of [[love]] is a factitious feeling, born of social usage, and
enhanced by the [[women]] with much [[care]] and cleverness, to establish their
empire, and put in [[power]] the [[sex]] which ought to obey. this feeling,
being founded on [[certain]] ideas [[idea]] of [[beauty]] and [[merit]] which a savage is
not in a position to acquire, and on comparisons which he is incapable
of making, must be for him almost non-existent; for, as his mind
cannot form abstract ideas [[idea]] of proportion and regularity, so his heart
is not susceptible of the feelings of [[love]] and admiration, which are
even insensibly produced by the application of these ideas [[idea]]. he follows
solely the [[character]] [[nature]] has implanted in him, and not tastes which
he could never have acquired; so that every woman equally answers [[answer]] his
purpose.

men in a [[state]] of [[nature]] being confined merely to what is physical in
love, and fortunate enough to be ignorant of those excellences, which
whet the appetite while they increase the difficulty of gratifying
it, must be [[subject]] to fewer and less [[violent]] fits of passion,
and consequently fall into fewer and less [[violent]] disputes. the
imagination, which causes such ravages among us, never speaks to the
heart of savages, who quietly await the impulses of [[nature]], yield to
them involuntarily, with more [[pleasure]] than ardour, and, their wants
once satisfied, lose the [[desire]]. it is therefore incontestable that
love, as well as all other [[passions]], must have acquired in society
that glowing impetuosity, which makes it so often fatal to [[mankind]].
and it is the more absurd to represent savages as continually cutting
one another's throats to indulge their brutality, because this opinion
is directly contrary to [[experience]]; the caribeans, who have as yet
least of all deviated from the [[state]] of [[nature]], being in [[fact]] the most
peaceable of [[people]] in their amours, and the least [[subject]] to [[jealousy]],
though they [[live]] in a hot [[climate]] which seems always to inflame the
passions.

with regard to the inferences that might be drawn, in the case of
several [[species]] of animals, the males of which fill our poultry-yards
with [[blood]] and slaughter, or in spring make the forests resound with
their quarrels over their females; we must begin by excluding all those
species, in which [[nature]] has plainly established, in the comparative
power of the sexes [[sex]], relations different from those which [[exist]] among
us: thus we can base no conclusion about [[men]] on the habits of fighting
cocks. in those [[species]] where the proportion is [[better]] observed, these
battles must be entirely due to the scarcity of females in comparison
with males; or, what amounts to the same thing, to the intervals during
which the female constantly refuses the advances of the male: for if
each female admits the male but during two months in the year, it
is the same as if the number of females were five-sixths less. now,
neither of these two cases is applicable to the [[human]] [[species]], in
which the number of females usually exceeds that of males, and among
whom it has never been observed, even among savages, that the females
have, like those of other animals, their stated times [[time]] of passion and
indifference. moreover, in several of these [[species]], the individuals
all take [[fire]] at once, and there comes a fearful moment of universal
passion, tumult and disorder among them; a scene which is never beheld
in the [[human]] [[species]], whose [[love]] is not thus seasonal. we must not
then conclude from the combats of such animals for the enjoyment of
the females, that the case would be the same with [[mankind]] in a state
of [[nature]]: and, even if we drew such a conclusion, we see that such
contests do not exterminate other kinds [[kind]] of animals, and we have no
reason to [[think]] they would be more fatal to ours. it is indeed clear
that they would do still less mischief than is the case in a [[state]] of
society; especially in those countries [[country]] in which, morals [[moral]] being still
held in some repute, the [[jealousy]] of lovers and the vengeance of
husbands are the daily cause of duels, murders, and even worse crimes;
where the obligation of eternal fidelity only occasions [[occasion]] adultery, and
the very laws [[law]] of [[honour]] and continence necessarily increase debauchery
and lead to the multiplication of abortions.

let us conclude then that [[man]] in a [[state]] of [[nature]], wandering up
and down the forests, without industry, without [[speech]], and without
home, an [[equal]] stranger to [[war]] and to all ties, neither standing in
need of his fellow-creatures nor having any [[desire]] to hurt them, and
perhaps even not distinguishing them one from another; let us conclude
that, being self-sufficient and [[subject]] to so few [[passions]], he could
have no feelings or [[knowledge]] but such as befitted his situation;
that he [[felt]] only his actual necessities, and disregarded everything
he did not [[think]] himself immediately concerned to notice, and that
his understanding made no greater [[progress]] than his vanity. if by
accident he made any discovery, he was the less able to communicate
it to others, as he did not [[know]] even his own [[children]]. every art
would necessarily perish with its inventor, where there was no [[kind]] of
education among [[men]], and generations [[generation]] succeeded generations [[generation]] without the
least advance; when, all setting out from the same point, centuries
must have elapsed in the barbarism of the first ages [[age]]; when the [[race]] was
already old, and [[man]] remained a child.

if i have expatiated at such length on this supposed primitive [[state]],
it is because i had so many ancient errors and inveterate prejudices
to eradicate, and therefore [[thought]] it incumbent on me to dig down to
their very root, and show, by means of a true picture of the state
of [[nature]], how far even the [[natural]] inequalities of [[mankind]] are from
having that reality and influence which [[modern]] writers suppose.

it is in [[fact]] easy to see that many of the differences which
distinguish [[men]] are merely the effect of habit and the different
methods of [[life]] [[men]] adopt in [[society]]. thus a robust or delicate
constitution, and the [[strength]] or weakness attaching to it, are more
frequently the effects of a hardy or effeminate method of education
than of the original endowment of the [[body]]. it is the same with the
powers of the [[mind]]; for [[education]] not only makes a difference between
such as are cultured and such as are not, but even increases the
differences which [[exist]] among the former, in proportion to their
respective degrees [[degree]] of [[culture]]: as the distance between a giant and
a dwarf on the same road increases with every step they take. if we
compare the prodigious [[diversity]], which obtains in the [[education]] and
manner of [[life]] of the various orders of [[men]] in the [[state]] of [[society]],
with the uniformity and simplicity of animal and savage [[life]], in
which every one lives [[life]] on the same [[kind]] of food and in exactly the
same manner, and does exactly the same things, it is easy to conceive
how much less the difference between [[man]] and [[man]] must be in a state
of [[nature]] than in a [[state]] of [[society]], and how greatly the natural
inequality of [[mankind]] must be increased by the inequalities of social
institutions.

but even if [[nature]] really affected, in the distribution of her gifts,
that partiality which is imputed to her, what advantage would the
greatest of her favourites derive from it, to the detriment of others,
in a [[state]] that admits of hardly any [[kind]] of relation between them?
where there is no [[love]], of what advantage is [[beauty]]? of what use is wit
to those who do not converse, or cunning to those who have no business
with others? i hear it constantly repeated that, in such a [[state]], the
strong would [[oppress]] the [[weak]]; but what is here meant by oppression?
some, it is said, would violently domineer over others, who would
groan under a servile submission to their caprices. this indeed is
exactly what i observe to be the case among us; but i do not see how
it can be inferred of [[men]] in a [[state]] of [[nature]], who could not easily
be brought to conceive what we mean by dominion and servitude. one
man, it is true, might seize the fruits which another had gathered,
the game he had killed, or the cave he had chosen for shelter; but how
would he ever be able to exact [[obedience]], and what ties of dependence
could there be among [[men]] without possessions? if, for instance, i am
driven from one tree, i can go to the next; if i am disturbed in one
place, what hinders me from going to another? again, should i happen to
meet with a [[man]] so much stronger than myself, and at the same [[time]] so
depraved, so indolent, and so barbarous, as to compel me to provide for
his sustenance while he himself remains idle; he must take [[care]] not to
have his [[eyes]] off me for a [[single]] moment; he must bind me fast before
he goes to sleep, or i shall certainly either knock him on the head
or make my escape. that is to say, he must in such a case voluntarily
expose himself to much greater trouble than he seeks to avoid, or can
give me. after all this, let him be off his guard ever so little;
let him but turn his head aside at any sudden noise, and i shall be
instantly twenty paces off, lost in the forest, and, my fetters burst
asunder, he would never see me again.

without my expatiating thus uselessly on these details, every one
must see that as the bonds of servitude are formed merely by the
mutual dependence of [[men]] on one another and the reciprocal needs that
unite them, it is impossible to make any [[man]] a [[slave]], unless he be
first reduced to a situation in which he cannot do without the help
of others: and, since such a situation does not [[exist]] in a [[state]] of
nature, every one is there his own master, and the [[law]] of the strongest
is of no effect.

having proved that the inequality of [[mankind]] is hardly [[felt]], and that
its influence is next to nothing in a [[state]] of [[nature]], i must next
show its origin and trace its [[progress]] in the successive developments
of the [[human]] [[mind]]. having shown that [[human]] _perfectibility_, the
social virtues [[virtue]], and the other faculties which [[natural]] [[man]] potentially
possessed, could never develop of themselves, but must require the
fortuitous concurrence of many [[foreign]] causes that might never arise,
and without which he would have remained for ever in his primitive
condition, i must now collect and consider the different accidents
which may have improved the [[human]] understanding while depraving the
species, and made [[man]] wicked while making him sociable; so as to bring
him and the [[world]] from that distant period to the point at which we now
behold them.

i confess that, as the events i am going to describe might have
happened in various ways, i have nothing to determine my [[choice]] but
conjectures: but such conjectures become reasons [[reason]], when they are the
most probable that can be drawn from the [[nature]] of things, and the only
means of discovering the [[truth]]. the consequences, however, which i mean
to deduce will not be barely conjectural; as, on the principles [[principle]] just
laid down, it would be impossible to form any other theory that would
not furnish the same results, and from which i could not draw the same
conclusions.

this will be a sufficient apology for my not dwelling on the manner in
which the lapse of [[time]] compensates for the little probability in the
events; on the surprising [[power]] of trivial causes, when their action is
constant; on the impossibility, on the one hand, of destroying certain
hypotheses, though on the other we cannot give them the certainty of
known matters of [[fact]]; on its being within the province of [[history]],
when two facts [[fact]] are given as real, and have to be connected by a series
of intermediate facts [[fact]], which are unknown or supposed to be so, to
supply such facts [[fact]] as may connect them; and on its being in the province
of [[philosophy]] when [[history]] is silent, to determine similar facts [[fact]] to
serve the same end; and lastly, on the influence of similarity, which,
in the case of events, reduces the facts [[fact]] to a much smaller number of
different classes than is commonly imagined. it is enough for me to
offer these hints to the consideration of my judges [[judge]], and to have so
arranged that the general reader has no need to consider them at all.

[2] justin. hist, ii, 2. so much more does the ignorance of [[vice]] profit
the one sort than the [[knowledge]] of [[virtue]] the other.

[3] egoism must not be confused with self-respect: for they differ both
in themselves and in their effects. self-respect is a [[natural]] feeling
which leads every animal to look to its own preservation, and which,
guided in [[man]] by [[reason]] and modified by compassion, creates humanity
and [[virtue]]. egoism is a purely relative and factitious feeling, which
arises in the [[state]] of [[society]], leads each [[individual]] to make more of
himself than of any other, causes all the mutual damage [[men]] inflict one
on another, and is the real source of the "sense of [[honour]]." this being
understood, i maintain that, in our primitive condition, in the true
state of [[nature]], egoism did not [[exist]]; for as each [[man]] regarded himself
as the only observer of his actions, the only being in the [[universe]] who
took any interest in him, and the sole [[judge]] of his deserts, no feeling
arising from comparisons he could not be [[led]] to make could take root
in his [[soul]]; and for the same [[reason]], he could [[know]] neither [[hatred]] nor
the [[desire]] for [[revenge]], since these [[passions]] can spring only from a
sense of injury: and as it is the contempt or the intention to hurt,
and not the harm done, which constitutes the injury, [[men]] who neither
valued nor compared themselves could do one another much [[violence]], when
it suited them, without feeling any sense of injury. in a word, each
man, regarding his fellows almost as he regarded animals of different
species, might seize the prey of a weaker or yield up his own to a
stronger, and yet consider these acts of [[violence]] as mere natural
occurrences, without the slightest emotion of insolence or despite, or
any other feeling than the joy or [[grief]] of [[success]] or failure.

the second part


the first [[man]] who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself
of saying _this is mine_, and found [[people]] simple enough to believe
him, was the real founder of civil [[society]]. from how many crimes, wars
and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one
have saved [[mankind]], by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch,
and crying to his fellows, "beware of listening to this impostor; you
are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the [[earth]], belong to
us all, and the [[earth]] itself to nobody." but there is [[great]] probability
that things had then already come to such a pitch, that they could no
longer continue as they were; for the [[idea]] of [[property]] depends on many
prior ideas [[idea]], which could only be acquired successively, and cannot have
been formed all at once in the [[human]] [[mind]].

mankind must have made very considerable [[progress]], and acquired
considerable [[knowledge]] and industry which they must also have
transmitted and increased from [[age]] to [[age]], before they arrived at this
last point of the [[state]] of [[nature]]. let us then go farther back and
endeavour to unify under a [[single]] point of view that slow succession of
events and discoveries in the most [[natural]] order.

man's first feeling was that of his own existence, and his first care
that of self-preservation. the [[produce]] of the [[earth]] furnished him
with all he needed, and instinct told him how to use it. [[hunger]] and
other appetites made him at various times [[time]] [[experience]] various modes of
existence; and among these was one which urged him to propagate his
species--a blind propensity that, having nothing to do with the [[heart]],
produced a merely animal act. the want once gratified, the two sexes
knew each other no more; and even the offspring was nothing to its
mother, as soon as it could do without her.

such was the condition of infant [[man]]; the [[life]] of an animal limited
at first to mere sensations, and hardly profiting by the gifts nature
bestowed on him, much less capable of entertaining a [[thought]] of forcing
anything from her. but difficulties soon presented themselves, and
it became necessary to learn how to surmount them: the height of the
trees, which prevented him from gathering their fruits, the competition
of other animals desirous of the same fruits, and the ferocity of those
who needed them for their own preservation, all obliged him to apply
himself to bodily exercises. he had to be active, swift of foot, and
vigorous in [[light]]. [[natural]] [[weapons]], stones and sticks, were easily
found: he learnt to surmount the obstacles of [[nature]], to contend in
case of necessity with other animals, and to dispute for the means of
subsistence even with other [[men]], or to indemnify himself for what he
was forced to give up to a stronger.

in proportion as the [[human]] [[race]] grew more numerous, men's cares
increased. the difference of soils, climates and seasons, must have
introduced some differences into their manner of living. barren years,
long and sharp winters, scorching summers which parched the fruits of
the [[earth]], must have demanded a new industry. on the sea-shore and the
banks of rivers, they [[invented]] the hook and line, and became fishermen
and eaters of fish. in the forests they made bows and arrows, and
became huntsmen and warriors. in cold countries [[country]] they clothed themselves
with the skins of the beasts they had slain. the lightning, a volcano,
or some lucky [[chance]] acquainted them with [[fire]], a new resource against
the rigours of winter: they next learned how to preserve this element,
then how to reproduce it, and finally how to prepare with it the flesh
of animals which before they had eaten raw.

this repeated relevance of various beings to himself, and one to
another, would naturally give rise in the [[human]] [[mind]] to the perceptions
of [[certain]] relations between them. thus the relations which we denote
by the terms, [[great]], small, [[strong]], [[weak]], swift, slow, fearful, bold,
and the like, almost insensibly compared at need, must have at length
produced in him a [[kind]] of reflection, or rather a mechanical prudence,
which would indicate to him the precautions most necessary to his
security.

the new [[intelligence]] which resulted from this [[development]] increased his
superiority over other animals, by making him sensible of it. he would
now endeavour, therefore, to ensnare them, would play them a thousand
tricks, and though many of them might surpass him in swiftness or in
strength, would in [[time]] become the master of some and the scourge of
others. thus, the first [[time]] he looked into himself, he [[felt]] the first
emotion of [[pride]]; and, at a [[time]] when he scarce knew how to distinguish
the different orders of beings, by looking upon his [[species]] as of the
highest order, he prepared the way for assuming pre-eminence as an
individual.

other [[men]], it is true, were not then to him what they now are to us,
and he had no greater intercourse with them than with other animals;
yet they were not neglected in his observations. the conformities,
which he would in [[time]] discover between them, and between himself and
his female, [[led]] him to [[judge]] of others which were not then perceptible;
and finding that they all behaved as he himself would have done in like
circumstances, he naturally inferred that their manner of thinking
and acting was altogether in conformity with his own. this important
truth, once deeply impressed on his [[mind]], must have induced him, from
an intuitive feeling more [[certain]] and much more rapid than any [[kind]] of
reasoning, to pursue the rules [[rule]] of conduct, which he had [[best]] observe
towards them, for his own security and advantage.

taught by [[experience]] that the [[love]] of well-being is the sole motive of
human actions, he found himself in a position to distinguish the few
cases, in which mutual interest might justify him in relying upon the
assistance of his fellows; and also the still fewer cases in which a
conflict of interests might give cause to suspect them. in the former
case, he joined in the same herd with them, or at most in some [[kind]] of
loose association, that laid no restraint on its members, and lasted no
longer than the transitory [[occasion]] that formed it. in the latter case,
every one sought his own private advantage, either by open [[force]], if he
thought himself [[strong]] enough, or by address and cunning, if he felt
himself the weaker.

in this manner, [[men]] may have insensibly acquired some gross ideas [[idea]] of
mutual undertakings, and of the advantages of fulfilling them: that
is, just so far as their [[present]] and apparent interest was concerned:
for they were [[perfect]] strangers to foresight, and were so far from
troubling themselves about the distant future, that they hardly thought
of the morrow. if a deer was to be taken, every one saw that, in
order to succeed, he must abide faithfully by his post: but if a hare
happened to come within the reach of any one of them, it is not to be
doubted that he pursued it without scruple, and, having seized his
prey, cared very little, if by so doing he caused his companions to
miss theirs.

it is easy to [[understand]] that such intercourse would not require a
language much more refined than that of rooks or monkeys, who associate
together for much the same, [[purpose]]. inarticulate cries, plenty of
gestures and some imitative sounds, must have been for a long [[time]] the
universal [[language]]; and by the addition, in every [[country]], of some
conventional articulate sounds (of which, as i have already intimated,
the first institution is not too easy to explain) particular languages
were produced; but these were rude and imperfect, and nearly such as
now to be found among some savage nations.

hurried on by the rapidity of [[time]], by the abundance of things i have
to say, and by the almost insensible [[progress]] of things in their
beginnings, i pass over in an instant a multitude of ages [[age]]; for the
slower the events were in their succession, the more rapidly may they
be described.

these first advances enabled [[men]] to make others with greater rapidity.
in proportion as they grew enlightened, they grew industrious. they
ceased to fall asleep under the first tree, or in the first cave that
afforded them shelter; they [[invented]] several kinds [[kind]] of implements of
hard and sharp stones, which they used to dig up the [[earth]], and to
cut wood; they then made huts out of branches, and afterwards learnt
to plaster them over with mud and clay. this was the epoch of a
first [[revolution]], which established and distinguished families [[family]], and
introduced a [[kind]] of [[property]], in itself the source of a thousand
quarrels and conflicts. as, however, the strongest were probably the
first to build themselves huts which they [[felt]] themselves able to
defend, it may be concluded that the [[weak]] found it much easier and
safer to imitate, than to attempt to dislodge them: and of those
who were once provided with huts, none could have any inducement to
appropriate that of his neighbour; not indeed so much because it did
not belong to him, as because it could be of no use, and he could not
make himself master of it without exposing himself to a desperate
battle with the [[family]] which occupied it.

the first expansions of the [[human]] [[heart]] were the effects of a novel
situation, which [[united]] husbands and wives [[wife]], fathers [[father]] and [[children]], under
one roof. the habit of living together soon gave rise to the finest
feelings known to [[humanity]], conjugal [[love]] and paternal affection. every
family became a little [[society]], the more [[united]] because liberty--and
reciprocal attachment were the only bonds of its union. the sexes [[sex]],
whose manner of [[life]] had been hitherto the same, began now to adopt
different ways of living. the [[women]] became more sedentary, and
accustomed themselves to [[mind]] the hut and their [[children]], while the
men went abroad in search of their [[common]] subsistence. from living a
softer [[life]], both sexes [[sex]] also began to lose something of their strength
and ferocity: but, if individuals [[individual]] became to some extent less able to
encounter wild beasts separately, they found it, on the other hand,
easier to assemble and resist in [[common]].

the simplicity and solitude of man's [[man]] [[life]] in this new condition, the
paucity of his wants, and the implements he had [[invented]] to satisfy
them, left him a [[great]] deal of leisure, which he employed to furnish
himself with many conveniences unknown to his fathers [[father]]: and this was the
first yoke he inadvertently imposed on himself, and the first source
of the evils [[evil]] he prepared for his descendants. for, besides continuing
thus to enervate both [[body]] and [[mind]], these conveniences lost with use
almost all their [[power]] to please, and even degenerated into real needs,
till the want of them became far more disagreeable than the possession
of them had been pleasant. [[men]] would have been unhappy at the loss of
them, though the possession did not make them [[happy]].

we can here see a little [[better]] how the use of [[speech]] became
established, and insensibly improved in each [[family]], and we may form
a conjecture also concerning the manner in which various causes may
have extended and accelerated the [[progress]] of [[language]], by making it
more and more necessary. floods or earthquakes surrounded inhabited
districts with precipices or waters: revolutions [[revolution]] of the globe tore off
portions from the continent, and made them islands. it is readily seen
that among [[men]] thus collected and compelled to [[live]] together, a common
idiom must have arisen much more easily than among those who still
wandered through the forests of the continent. thus it is very possible
that after their first essays in navigation the islanders brought over
the use of [[speech]] to the continent: and it is at least very probable
that communities [[community]] and languages [[language]] were first established in islands, and
even came to [[perfection]] there before they were known on the mainland.

everything now begins to [[change]] its aspect. [[men]], who have up to now
been roving in the woods, by taking to a more settled manner of [[life]],
come gradually together, form separate bodies [[body]], and at length in every
country arises a distinct nation, [[united]] in [[character]] and manners,
not by regulations or laws [[law]], but by uniformity of [[life]] and food, and
the [[common]] influence of [[climate]]. permanent neighbourhood could not
fail to [[produce]], in [[time]], some connection between different families [[family]].
among [[young]] [[people]] of opposite sexes [[sex]], living in neighbouring huts,
the transient commerce required by [[nature]] soon [[led]], through mutual
intercourse, to another [[kind]] not less agreeable, and more permanent.
men began now to take the difference between objects into account,
and to make comparisons; they acquired imperceptibly the ideas [[idea]] of
beauty and [[merit]], which soon gave rise to feelings of preference. in
consequence of seeing each other often, they could not do without
seeing each other constantly. a tender and pleasant feeling insinuated
itself into their souls [[soul]], and the least opposition turned it into an
impetuous fury: with [[love]] arose [[jealousy]]; discord triumphed, and human
blood was sacrificed to the gentlest of all [[passions]].

as ideas [[idea]] and feelings succeeded one another, and [[heart]] and head
were brought into play, [[men]] continued to lay aside their original
wildness; their private connections became every day more intimate
as their limits extended. they accustomed themselves to assemble
before their huts round a large tree; singing and dancing, the true
offspring of [[love]] and leisure, became the amusement, or rather the
occupation, of [[men]] and [[women]] thus assembled together with nothing
else to do. each one began to consider the rest, and to [[wish]] to be
considered in turn; and thus a--value came to be attached to public
esteem. whoever sang or danced [[best]], whoever was the handsomest, the
strongest, the most dexterous, or the most eloquent, came to be of
most consideration; and this was the first step towards inequality,
and at the same [[time]] towards [[vice]]. from these first distinctions arose
on the one side vanity and contempt and on the other shame and envy:
and the fermentation caused by these new leavens ended by producing
combinations fatal to innocence and [[happiness]].

as soon as [[men]] began to value one another, and the [[idea]] of
consideration had got a footing in the [[mind]], every one put in his claim
to it, and it became impossible to refuse it to any with impunity.
hence arose the first obligations of civility even among savages; and
every intended injury became an affront; because, besides the hurt
which might result from it, the party injured was [[certain]] to find in it
a contempt for his [[person]], which was often more insupportable than the
hurt itself.

thus, as every [[man]] punished the contempt shown him by others, in
proportion to his [[opinion]] of himself, [[revenge]] became terrible, and men
bloody and cruel. this is precisely the [[state]] reached by most of the
savage nations known to us: and it is for want of having made a proper
distinction in our ideas [[idea]], and seen how very far they already are from
the [[state]] of [[nature]], that so many writers have hastily concluded that
man is naturally cruel, and requires civil [[institutions]] to make him
more mild; whereas nothing is more gentle than [[man]] in his primitive
state, as he is placed by [[nature]] at an [[equal]] distance from the
stupidity of brutes, and the fatal ingenuity of civilised [[man]]. equally
confined by instinct and [[reason]] to the sole [[care]] of guarding himself
against the mischiefs which threaten him, he is restrained by natural
compassion from doing any injury to others, and is not [[led]] to do such a
thing even in return for injuries received. for, according to the axiom
of the [[wise]] locke, _there can be no injury, where there is no property_.

but it must be remarked that the [[society]] thus formed, and the relations
thus established among [[men]], required of them qualities different from
those which they possessed from their primitive [[constitution]]. morality
began to appear in [[human]] actions, and every one, before the institution
of [[law]], was the only [[judge]] and avenger of the injuries done him, so
that the goodness which was suitable in the pure [[state]] of [[nature]] was
no longer proper in the new-born [[state]] of [[society]]. punishments [[punishment]] had
to be made more severe, as opportunities of offending became more
frequent, and the dread of vengeance had to take the place of the
rigour of the [[law]]. thus, though [[men]] had become less patient, and their
natural compassion had already [[suffered]] some diminution, this period
of expansion of the [[human]] faculties, keeping a just mean between the
indolence of the primitive [[state]] and the petulant activity of our
egoism, must have been the happiest and most stable of epochs. the
more we reflect on it, the more we shall find that this [[state]] was the
least [[subject]] to revolutions [[revolution]], and altogether the very [[best]] [[man]] could
experience; so that he can have departed from it only through some
fatal accident, which, for the [[public]] [[good]], should never have happened.
the [[example]] of savages, most of whom have been found in this [[state]],
seems to prove that [[men]] were meant to remain in it, that it is the
real [[youth]] of the [[world]], and that all subsequent advances have been
apparently so many steps towards the [[perfection]] of the [[individual]], but
in reality towards the decrepitude of the [[species]].

so long as [[men]] remained content with their rustic huts, so long as
they were satisfied with clothes made of the skins of animals and sewn
together with thorns and fish-bones, adorned themselves only with
feathers and shells, and continued to paint their bodies [[body]] different
colours, to improve and beautify their bows and arrows and to make
with sharp-edged stones fishing boats or clumsy musical instruments;
in a word, so long as they undertook only what a [[single]] [[person]] could
accomplish, and confined themselves to such [[arts]] as did not require the
joint [[labour]] of several hands, they lived [[free]], healthy, honest and
happy lives [[life]], so long as their [[nature]] allowed, and as they continued to
enjoy the pleasures [[pleasure]] of mutual and independent intercourse. but from
the moment one [[man]] began to stand in need of the [[help]] of another; from
the moment it appeared advantageous to any one [[man]] to have enough
provisions for two, equality disappeared, [[property]] was introduced, work
became indispensable, and vast forests became smiling fields, which man
had to water with the sweat of his brow, and where [[slavery]] and misery
were soon seen to germinate and grow up with the crops.

metallurgy and agriculture were the two [[arts]] which produced this great
revolution. the poets tell us it was gold and silver, but, for the
philosophers, it was iron and corn, which first civilised [[men]], and
ruined [[humanity]]. thus both were unknown to the savages of [[america]], who
for that [[reason]] are still savage; the other nations also seem to have
continued in a [[state]] of barbarism while they practised only one of
these [[arts]]. one of the [[best]] reasons [[reason]], perhaps, why [[europe]] has been, if
not longer, at least more constantly and highly civilised than the rest
of the [[world]], is that it is at once the most abundant in iron and the
most fertile in corn.

it is difficult to conjecture how [[men]] first came to [[know]] and use iron;
for it is impossible to suppose they would of themselves [[think]] of
digging the ore out of the mine, and preparing it for smelting, before
they knew what would be the result. on the other hand, we have the less
reason to suppose this discovery the effect of any accidental [[fire]], as
mines are only formed in barren places, bare of trees and plants; so
that it looks as if [[nature]] had taken pains [[pain]] to keep the fatal secret
from us. there remains, therefore, only the extraordinary accident
of some volcano which, by ejecting metallic substances already in
fusion, suggested to the spectators the [[idea]] of imitating the natural
operation. and we must further conceive them as possessed of uncommon
courage and foresight, to undertake so laborious a [[work]], with so
distant a prospect of drawing advantage from it; yet these qualities
are [[united]] only in minds [[mind]] more advanced than we can suppose those of
these first discoverers to have been.

with regard to agriculture, the principles [[principle]] of it were known long before
they were put in practice; and it is indeed hardly possible that [[men]],
constantly employed in drawing their subsistence from plants and trees,
should not readily acquire a [[knowledge]] of the means made use of by
nature for the propagation of vegetables. it was in all probability
very fang, however, before their industry took that turn, either
because trees, which together with hunting and fishing afforded them
food, did not require their attention; or because they were ignorant of
the use of corn, or without instruments to cultivate it; or because
they lacked foresight to future needs; or lastly, because they were
without means of preventing others from robbing them of the fruit of
their [[labour]].

when they grew more industrious, it is [[natural]] to [[believe]] that they
began, with the [[help]] of sharp stones and pointed sticks, to cultivate
a few vegetables or roots around their huts; though it was long before
they knew how to prepare corn, or were provided with the implements
necessary for raising it in any large quantity; not to mention how
essential it is, for husbandry, to [[consent]] to immediate loss, in order
to reap a future gain--a precaution very [[foreign]] to the turn of a
savage's [[mind]]; for, as i have said, he hardly foresees in the morning
what he will need at night.

the invention of the other [[arts]] must therefore have been necessary
to compel [[mankind]] to apply themselves to agriculture. no sooner were
artificers wanted to smelt and forge iron, than others were required
to maintain them; the more hands that were employed in manufactures,
the fewer were left to provide for the [[common]] subsistence, though
the number of mouths to be furnished with food remained the same:
and as some required commodities in exchange for their iron, the
rest at length discovered the method of making iron serve for the
multiplication of commodities. by this means the [[arts]] of husbandry and
agriculture were established on the one hand, and the art [[arts]] of working
metals and multiplying their uses on the other.

the cultivation of the [[earth]] necessarily brought about its
distribution; and [[property]], once recognised, gave rise to the first
rules of [[justice]]; for, to secure each [[man]] his own, it had to be
possible for each to have something. besides, as [[men]] began to look
forward to the future, and all had something to lose, every one
had [[reason]] to apprehend that reprisals would [[follow]] any injury he
might do to another. this origin is so much the more [[natural]], as it
is impossible to conceive how [[property]] can come from anything but
manual [[labour]]: for what else can a [[man]] add to things which he does
not originally create, so as to make them his own [[property]]? it is the
husbandman's [[labour]] alone that, giving him a title to the [[produce]] of
the ground he has tilled, gives him a claim also to the [[land]] itself,
at least till harvest; and so, from year to year, a constant possession
which is easily transformed into [[property]]. when the ancients, says
grotius, gave to ceres the title of legislatrix, and to a festival
celebrated in her [[honour]] the name of thesmophoria, they meant by that
that the distribution of lands [[land]] had produced a new [[kind]] of [[right]]: that
is to say, the [[right]] of [[property]], which is different from the right
deducible from the [[law]] of [[nature]].

in this [[state]] of affairs, equality might have been sustained, had the
talents of individuals [[individual]] been [[equal]], and had, for [[example]], the use of
iron and the consumption of commodities always exactly balanced each
other; but, as there was nothing to preserve this balance, it was
soon disturbed; the strongest did most [[work]]; the most skilful turned
his [[labour]] to [[best]] account; the most ingenious devised methods of
diminishing his [[labour]]: the husbandman wanted more iron, or the smith
more corn, and, while both laboured equally, the one gained a great
deal by his [[work]], while the other could hardly support himself. thus
natural inequality unfolds itself insensibly with that of combination,
and the difference between [[men]], developed by their different
circumstances, becomes more sensible and permanent in its effects, and
begins to have an influence, in the same proportion, over the lot of
individuals.

matters once at this pitch, it is easy to imagine the rest. i shall not
detain the reader with a description of the successive invention of
other [[arts]], the [[development]] of [[language]], the [[trial]] and utilisation of
talents, the inequality of fortunes [[fortune]], the use and [[abuse]] of riches [[rich]], and
all the details connected with them which the reader can easily supply
for himself. i shall confine myself to a glance at [[mankind]] in this new
situation.

behold then all [[human]] faculties developed, memory and [[imagination]] in
full play, egoism interested, [[reason]] active, and the [[mind]] almost at the
highest point of its [[perfection]]. behold all the [[natural]] qualities in
action, the rank and condition of every [[man]] assigned him; not merely
his share of [[property]] and his [[power]] to serve or injure others, but
also his wit, [[beauty]], [[strength]] or [[skill]], [[merit]] or [[talents]]: and these
being the only qualities capable of commanding [[respect]], it soon became
necessary to possess or to affect them.

it now became the interest of [[men]] to appear what they really were
not. to be and to seem became two totally different things; and from
this distinction sprang insolent pomp and cheating trickery, with all
the numerous vices [[vice]] that go in their train. on the other hand, free
and independent as [[men]] were before, they were now, in consequence of
a multiplicity of new wants, brought into subjection, as it were,
to all [[nature]], and particularly to one another; and each became in
some [[degree]] a [[slave]] even in becoming the master of other [[men]]: if
rich, they stood in need of the services of others; if [[poor]], of their
assistance; and even a middle condition did not enable them to do
without one another. [[man]] must now, therefore, have been perpetually
employed in getting others to interest themselves in his lot, and in
making them, apparently at least, if not really, find their advantage
in promoting his own. thus he must have been sly and artful in his
behaviour to some, and imperious and cruel to others; being under a
kind of necessity to ill-use all the persons [[person]] of whom he stood in need,
when he could not frighten them into compliance, and did not [[judge]] it
his interest to be useful to them. insatiable [[ambition]], the thirst of
raising their respective fortunes [[fortune]], not so much from real want as from
the [[desire]] to surpass others, inspired all [[men]] with a vile propensity
to injure one another, and with a secret [[jealousy]], which is the more
dangerous, as it puts on the mask of benevolence, to carry its point
with greater security. in a word, there arose rivalry and competition
on the one hand, and conflicting interests on the other, together with
a secret [[desire]] on both of profiting at the expense of others. all
these evils [[evil]] were the first effects of [[property]], and the inseparable
attendants of growing inequality.

before the invention of signs to represent riches [[rich]], [[wealth]] could hardly
consist in anything but lands [[land]] and cattle, the only real possessions
men can have. but, when inheritances so increased in number and extent
as to occupy the whole of the [[land]], and to border on one another, one
man could aggrandise himself only at the expense of another; at the
same [[time]] the supernumeraries, who had been too [[weak]] or too indolent to
make such acquisitions, and had grown [[poor]] without sustaining any loss,
because, while they saw everything [[change]] around them, they remained
still the same, were obliged to receive their subsistence, or steal
it, from the [[rich]]; and this soon bred, according to their different
characters, dominion and [[slavery]], or [[violence]] and rapine. the wealthy,
on their part, had no sooner begun to taste the [[pleasure]] of command,
than they disdained all others, and, using their old slaves [[slave]] to acquire
new, [[thought]] of nothing but subduing and enslaving their neighbours;
like ravenous wolves, which, having once tasted [[human]] flesh, despise
every other food and thenceforth seek only [[men]] to devour.

thus, as the most powerful or the most miserable considered their might
or misery as a [[kind]] of [[right]] to the possessions of others, equivalent,
in their [[opinion]], to that of [[property]], the destruction of equality
was attended by the most terrible disorders. usurpations by the [[rich]],
robbery by the [[poor]], and the unbridled [[passions]] of both, suppressed
the cries of [[natural]] compassion and the still feeble voice of [[justice]],
and filled [[men]] with avarice, [[ambition]] and [[vice]]. between the title of
the strongest and that of the first occupier, there arose perpetual
conflicts, which never ended but in battles [[battle]] and bloodshed. the new-born
state of [[society]] thus gave rise to a horrible [[state]] of [[war]]; [[men]] thus
harassed and depraved were no longer capable of retracing their steps
or renouncing the fatal acquisitions they had made, but, labouring by
the [[abuse]] of the faculties which do them [[honour]], merely to their own
confusion, brought themselves to the brink of ruin.

_attonitus novitate mali, divesque miserque,_
_effugere optat opes; et quæ modô voverat odit._[5]

it is impossible that [[men]] should not at length have reflected on so
wretched a situation, and on the calamities that overwhelmed them.
the [[rich]], in particular, must have [[felt]] how much they [[suffered]] by a
constant [[state]] of [[war]], of which they bore all the expense; and in
which, though all risked their lives [[life]], they alone risked their [[property]].
besides, however speciously they might [[disguise]] their usurpations,
they knew that they were founded on precarious and false titles; so
that, if others took from them by [[force]] what they themselves had
gained by [[force]], they would have no [[reason]] to [[complain]]. even those
who had been enriched by their own industry, could hardly base their
proprietorship on [[better]] claims. it was in [[vain]] to repeat, "i built
this well; i gained this spot by my industry." who gave you your
standing, it might be answered, and what [[right]] have you to demand
payment of us for doing what we never [[asked]] you to do? do you not
know that numbers of your fellow-creatures are starving, for want
of what you have too much of? you ought to have had the express and
universal [[consent]] of [[mankind]], before appropriating more of the common
subsistence than you needed for your own maintenance. destitute of
valid reasons [[reason]] to justify and sufficient [[strength]] to defend himself,
able to crush individuals [[individual]] with ease, but easily crushed himself by a
troop of bandits, one against all, and incapable, on account of mutual
jealousy, of joining with his equals [[equal]] against numerous enemies [[enemy]] united
by the [[common]] [[hope]] of plunder, the [[rich]] [[man]], thus urged by necessity,
conceived at length the profoundest plan that ever entered the [[mind]] of
man: this was to employ in his favour the forces [[force]] of those who attacked
him, to make allies of his adversaries, to inspire them with different
maxims, and to give them other [[institutions]] as favourable to himself as
the [[law]] of [[nature]] was unfavourable.

with this view, after having represented to his neighbours the horror
of a situation which armed every [[man]] against the rest, and made their
possessions as burdensome to them as their wants, and in which no
safety could be expected either in riches [[rich]] or in [[poverty]], he readily
devised plausible arguments to make them close with his design. "let
us join," said he, "to guard the [[weak]] from oppression, to restrain the
ambitious, and secure to every [[man]] the possession of what belongs to
him: let us institute rules [[rule]] of [[justice]] and [[peace]], to which all without
exception may be obliged to conform; rules [[rule]] that may in some measure
make amends for the caprices of [[fortune]], by subjecting equally the
powerful and the [[weak]] to the observance of reciprocal obligations.
let us, in a word, instead of turning our forces [[force]] against ourselves,
collect them in a supreme [[power]] which may govern us by [[wise]] laws [[law]],
protect and defend all the members of the association, repulse their
common enemies [[enemy]], and maintain eternal harmony among us."

far fewer words to this [[purpose]] would have been enough to impose on
men so barbarous and easily seduced; especially as they had too many
disputes among themselves to do without arbitrators, and too much
ambition and avarice to go long without masters. all ran headlong to
their chains, in hopes [[hope]] of securing their [[liberty]]; for they had just wit
enough to perceive the advantages of [[political]] [[institutions]], without
experience enough to enable them to foresee the dangers. the most
capable of fore-seeing the dangers were the very persons [[person]] who expected
to benefit by them; and even the most prudent judged it not inexpedient
to [[sacrifice]] one part of their [[freedom]] to ensure the rest; as a wounded
man has his arm cut off to save the rest of his [[body]].

such was, or may well have been, the origin of [[society]] and [[law]], which
bound new fetters on the [[poor]], and gave new powers [[power]] to the [[rich]]; which
irretrievably destroyed [[natural]] [[liberty]], eternally fixed the [[law]] of
property and inequality, converted clever usurpation into unalterable
right, and, for the advantage of a few ambitious individuals [[individual]], subjected
all [[mankind]] to perpetual [[labour]], [[slavery]] and wretchedness. it is easy
to see how the establishment of one [[community]] made that of all the
rest necessary, and how, in order to make head against [[united]] forces [[force]],
the rest of [[mankind]] had to unite in turn. societies [[society]] soon multiplied
and spread over the face of the [[earth]], till hardly a corner of the
world was left in which a [[man]] could escape the yoke, and withdraw
his head from beneath the [[sword]] which he saw perpetually hanging
over him by a thread. civil [[right]] having thus become the [[common]] rule
among the members of each [[community]], the [[law]] of [[nature]] maintained its
place only between different communities [[community]], where, under the name of
the [[right]] of nations, it was qualified by [[certain]] tacit conventions,
in order to make commerce practicable, and serve as a substitute for
natural compassion, which lost, when applied to societies [[society]], almost
all the influence it had over individuals [[individual]], and survived no longer
except in some [[great]] cosmopolitan spirits, who, breaking down the
imaginary barriers that separate different peoples [[people]], [[follow]] the example
of our [[sovereign]] creator, and include the whole [[human]] [[race]] in their
benevolence.

but bodies [[body]] [[politic]], remaining thus in a [[state]] of [[nature]] among
themselves, presently experienced the inconveniences which had obliged
individuals to forsake it; for this [[state]] became still more fatal
to these [[great]] bodies [[body]] than it had been to the individuals [[individual]] of whom
they were composed. hence arose national wars [[war]], battles [[battle]], murders, and
reprisals, which shock [[nature]] and outrage [[reason]]; together with all
those horrible prejudices which class among the virtues [[virtue]] the honour
of shedding [[human]] [[blood]]. the most distinguished [[men]] hence learned to
consider cutting each other's throats a [[duty]]; at length [[men]] massacred
their fellow-creatures by thousands without so much as knowing why, and
committed more murders in a [[single]] day's fighting, and more violent
outrages in the sack of a [[single]] town, than were committed in the state
of [[nature]] during whole ages [[age]] over the whole [[earth]]. such were the first
effects which we can see to have followed the division of [[mankind]] into
different communities [[community]]. but let us return to their [[institutions]].

i [[know]] that some writers have given other explanations of the origin
of [[political]] societies [[society]], such as the [[conquest]] of the powerful, or the
association of the [[weak]]. it is, indeed, indifferent to my argument
which of these causes we choose. that which i have just laid down,
however, appears to me the most [[natural]] for the following reasons [[reason]].
first: because, in the first case, the [[right]] of [[conquest]], being no
right, in itself, could not serve as a foundation on which to build any
other; the victor and the vanquished [[people]] still remained with respect
to each other in the [[state]] of [[war]], unless the vanquished, restored to
the full possession of their [[liberty]], voluntarily made [[choice]] of the
victor for their [[chief]]. for till then, whatever capitulation may have
been made being founded on [[violence]], and therefore _ipso facto_ void,
there could not have been on this hypothesis either a real [[society]] or
body [[politic]], or any [[law]] other than that of the strongest. secondly:
because the words _strong_ and _weak_ are, in the second case,
ambiguous; for during the interval between the establishment of a right
of [[property]], or prior occupancy, and that of [[political]] [[government]],
the meaning of these words is [[better]] expressed by the terms _rich_ and
_poor_: because, in [[fact]], before the institution of laws [[law]], [[men]] had no
other way of reducing their equals [[equal]] to submission, than by attacking
their goods [[good]], or making some of their own over to them. thirdly:
because, as the [[poor]] had nothing but their [[freedom]] to lose, it would
have been in the highest [[degree]] absurd for them to resign voluntarily
the only [[good]] they still enjoyed, without getting anything in exchange:
whereas the [[rich]] having feelings, if i may so express myself, in
every part of their possessions, it was much easier to harm them, and
therefore more necessary for them to take precautions against it; and,
in short, because it is more reasonable to suppose a thing to have been
invented by those to whom it would be of service, than by those whom it
must have harmed.

government had, in its infancy, no regular and constant form. the want
of [[experience]] and [[philosophy]] prevented [[men]] from seeing any but present
inconveniences, and they [[thought]] of providing against others only as
they presented themselves. in spite of the endeavours of the wisest
legislators, the [[political]] [[state]] remained imperfect, because it was
little more than the [[work]] of [[chance]]; and, as it had begun ill, though
time revealed its defects and suggested remedies, the original faults
were never repaired. it was continually being patched up, when the
first task should have been to get the site cleared and all the old
materials removed, as was done by lycurgus at sparta, if a stable and
lasting edifice was to be erected. [[society]] consisted at first merely of
a few general conventions, which every member bound himself to observe;
and for the performance of covenants the whole [[body]] went security to
each [[individual]]. [[experience]] only could show the weakness of such a
constitution, and how easily it might be infringed with impunity, from
the difficulty of convicting [[men]] of faults [[fault]], where the [[public]] alone
was to be witness and [[judge]]: the laws [[law]] could not but be eluded in many
ways; disorders and inconveniences could not but multiply continually,
till it became necessary to commit the dangerous trust of public
authority to private persons [[person]], and the [[care]] of enforcing [[obedience]] to
the deliberations of the [[people]] to the magistrate. for to say that
chiefs were chosen before the confederacy was formed, and that the
administrators of the laws [[law]] were there before the laws [[law]] themselves, is
too absurd a supposition to consider seriously.

it would be as unreasonable to suppose that [[men]] at first threw
themselves irretrievably and unconditionally into the arms of an
absolute master, and that the first expedient which proud and
unsubdued [[men]] hit upon for their [[common]] security was to run headlong
into [[slavery]]. for what [[reason]], in [[fact]], did they take to themselves
superiors, if it was not in order that they might be defended from
oppression, and have protection for their lives [[life]], liberties [[liberty]] and
properties, which are, so to speak, the constituent elements of their
being? now, in the relations between [[man]] and [[man]], the worst that can
happen is for one to find himself at the [[mercy]] of another, and it would
have been inconsistent with common-sense to begin by bestowing on a
chief the only things they wanted his [[help]] to preserve. what equivalent
could he offer them for so [[great]] a [[right]]? and if he had presumed to
exact it under pretext of defending them, would he not have received
the [[answer]] recorded in the fable: "what more can the [[enemy]] do to us?"
it is therefore beyond dispute, and indeed the fundamental [[maxim]] of
all [[political]] [[right]], that [[people]] have set up chiefs [[chief]] to [[protect]] their
liberty, and not to enslave them. _if we have a prince_, said pliny to
trajan, _it is to save ourselves from having a master_.

politicians indulge in the same sophistry about the [[love]] of liberty
as [[philosophers]] about the [[state]] of [[nature]]. they [[judge]], by what they
see, of very different things, which they have not seen; and attribute
to [[man]] a [[natural]] propensity to servitude, because the slaves [[slave]] within
their observation are seen to bear the yoke with patience; they fail
to reflect that it is with [[liberty]] as with innocence and [[virtue]]; the
value is known only to those who possess them, and the taste for them
is forfeited when they are forfeited themselves. "i [[know]] the charms of
your [[country]]," said brasidas to a satrap, who was comparing the [[life]] at
sparta with that at persepolis, "but you cannot [[know]] the pleasures [[pleasure]] of
mine."

an unbroken horse erects his mane, paws the ground and starts back
impetuously at the sight of the bridle; while one which is properly
trained suffers patiently even whip and spur: so savage [[man]] will not
bend his neck to the yoke to which civilised [[man]] submits without a
murmur, but prefers the most turbulent [[state]] of [[liberty]] to the most
peaceful [[slavery]]. we cannot therefore, from the servility of nations
already enslaved, [[judge]] of the [[natural]] disposition of [[mankind]] for
or against [[slavery]]; we should go by the prodigious efforts of every
free [[people]] to save itself from oppression. i [[know]] that the former
are for ever holding forth in [[praise]] of the tranquillity they enjoy
in their chains, and that they call a [[state]] of wretched servitude a
state of [[peace]]: _miserrimam servitutem pacem appellant_.[6] but when
i observe the latter sacrificing [[pleasure]], [[peace]], [[wealth]], [[power]] and
life itself to the preservation of that one treasure, which is so
disdained by those who have lost it; when i see free-born animals
dash their brains out against the bars of their cage, from an innate
impatience of captivity; when i behold numbers of naked savages, that
despise [[european]] pleasures [[pleasure]], braving [[hunger]], [[fire]], the [[sword]] and [[death]],
to preserve nothing but their independence, i [[feel]] that it is not for
slaves to argue about [[liberty]].

with regard to paternal [[authority]], from which some writers have derived
absolute [[government]] and all [[society]], it is enough, without going back
to the contrary arguments of locke and sidney, to remark that nothing
on [[earth]] can be further from the ferocious spirit of despotism than the
mildness of that [[authority]] which looks more to the advantage of him who
obeys than to that of him who commands; that, by the [[law]] of [[nature]], the
father is the child's master no longer than his [[help]] is necessary; that
from that [[time]] they are both [[equal]], the [[son]] being perfectly independent
of the [[father]], and owing him only [[respect]] and not [[obedience]]. for
gratitude is a [[duty]] which ought to be paid, but not a [[right]] to be
exacted: instead of saying that civil [[society]] is derived from paternal
authority, we ought to say rather that the latter derives its principal
force from the former. no [[individual]] was ever acknowledged as the
father of many, till his sons [[son]] and daughters [[daughter]] remained settled around
him. the goods [[good]] of the [[father]], of which he is really the master, are
the ties which keep his [[children]] in dependence, and he may bestow on
them, if he pleases, no share of his [[property]], unless they [[merit]] it by
constant deference to his will. but the subjects [[subject]] of an arbitrary despot
are so far from having the like favour to expect from their [[chief]],
that they themselves and everything they possess are his [[property]], or
at least are considered by him as such; so that they are forced to
receive, as a favour, the little of their own he is pleased to leave
them. when he despoils them, he does but [[justice]], and [[mercy]] in that he
permits them to [[live]].

by proceeding thus to test [[fact]] by [[right]], we should discover as little
reason as [[truth]] in the voluntary establishment of [[tyranny]]. it would
also be no easy matter to prove the validity of a contract binding on
only one of the parties, where all the risk is on one side, and none on
the other; so that no one could suffer but he who bound himself. this
hateful [[system]] is indeed, even in [[modern]] times [[time]], very far from being
that of [[wise]] and [[good]] monarchs, and especially of the kings [[king]] of [[france]];
as may be seen from several passages in their edicts; particularly from
the following passage in a celebrated edict published in 1667 in the
name and by order of louis xiv.

"let it not, therefore, be said that the [[sovereign]] is not subject
to the laws [[law]] of his [[state]]; since the contrary is a true proposition
of the [[right]] of nations, which [[flattery]] has sometimes attacked but
good princes [[prince]] have always defended as the tutelary divinity of their
dominions. how much more legitimate is it to say with the [[wise]] [[plato]],
that the [[perfect]] felicity of a [[kingdom]] consists in the [[obedience]] of
subjects to their [[prince]], and of the [[prince]] to the laws [[law]], and in the
laws being just and constantly directed to the [[public]] good!"[7]

i shall not stay here to inquire whether, as [[liberty]] is the noblest
faculty of [[man]], it is not degrading our very [[nature]], reducing ourselves
to the level of the brutes, which are mere slaves [[slave]] of instinct, and even
an affront to the author of our being, to renounce without reserve
the most precious of all his gifts, and to bow to the necessity
of committing all the crimes he has forbidden, merely to gratify a
mad or a cruel master; or if this sublime craftsman ought not to be
less angered at seeing his workmanship entirely destroyed than thus
dishonoured. i will waive (if my opponents please) the [[authority]] of
barbeyrac, who, following locke, roundly declares that no [[man]] can so
far sell his [[liberty]] as to submit to an arbitrary [[power]] which may
use him as it likes. _for_, he adds, _this would be to sell his own
life, of which he is not master_. i shall ask only what [[right]] those
who were not afraid thus to debase themselves could have to subject
their [[posterity]] to the same ignominy, and to renounce for them those
blessings which they do not owe to the liberality of their progenitors,
and without which [[life]] itself must be a burden to all who are worthy of
it.

puffendorf says that we may divest ourselves of our [[liberty]] in favour
of other [[men]], just as we transfer our [[property]] from one to another by
contracts and agreements. but this seems a very [[weak]] argument. for in
the first place, the [[property]] i alienate becomes quite [[foreign]] to me,
nor can i suffer from the [[abuse]] of it; but it very nearly concerns me
that my [[liberty]] should not be abused, and i cannot without incurring
the guilt of the crimes i may be compelled to commit, expose myself
to become an instrument of crime. besides, the [[right]] of property
being only a convention of [[human]] institution, [[men]] may dispose of
what they possess as they please: but this is not the case with the
essential gifts of [[nature]], such as [[life]] and [[liberty]], which every [[man]] is
permitted to enjoy, and of which it is at least doubtful whether any
have a [[right]] to divest themselves. by giving up the one, we degrade
our being; by giving up the other, we do our [[best]] to annul it; and,
as no temporal [[good]] can indemnify us for the loss of either, it would
be an offence against both [[reason]] and [[nature]] to renounce them at any
price whatsoever. but, even if we could transfer our [[liberty]], as we
do our [[property]], there would be a [[great]] difference with regard to the
children, who enjoy the father's substance only by the transmission of
his [[right]]; whereas, [[liberty]] being a gift which they hold from nature
as being [[men]], their parents have no [[right]] whatever to deprive them of
it. as then, to establish [[slavery]], it was necessary to do [[violence]] to
nature, so, in order to perpetuate such a [[right]], [[nature]] would have to
be changed. jurists, who have gravely determined that the child of a
slave comes into the [[world]] a [[slave]], have decided, in other words, that
a [[man]] shall come into the [[world]] not a [[man]].

i regard it then as [[certain]], that [[government]] did not begin with
arbitrary [[power]], but that this is the depravation, the extreme term,
of [[government]], and brings it back, finally, to just the [[law]] of the
strongest, which it was originally designed to remedy. supposing,
however, it had begun in this manner, such [[power]], being in itself
illegitimate, could not have served as a basis for the laws [[law]] of [[society]],
nor, consequently, for the inequality they instituted.

without entering at [[present]] upon the investigations which still remain
to be made into the [[nature]] of the fundamental compact underlying
all [[government]], i content myself with adopting the [[common]] opinion
concerning it, and regard the establishment of the [[political]] [[body]] as
a real contract between the [[people]] and the chiefs [[chief]] chosen by them: a
contract by which both parties bind themselves to observe the laws
therein expressed, which form the ties of their union. the people
having in [[respect]] of their social relations concentrated all their
wills in one, the several articles, concerning which this will is
explained, become so many fundamental laws [[law]], obligatory on all the
members of the [[state]] without exception, and one of these articles
regulates the [[choice]] and [[power]] of the magistrates appointed to watch
over the execution of the rest. this [[power]] extends to everything which
may maintain the [[constitution]], without going so far as to alter it.
it is accompanied by honours [[honour]], in order to bring the laws [[law]] and their
administrators into [[respect]]. the ministers are also distinguished by
personal prerogatives, in order to recompense them for the cares [[care]] and
labour which [[good]] administration involves. the magistrate, on his side,
binds himself to use the [[power]] he is entrusted with only in conformity
with the intention of his constituents, to maintain them all in the
peaceable possession of what belongs to them, and to prefer on every
occasion the [[public]] interest to his own.

before [[experience]] had shown, or [[knowledge]] of the [[human]] [[heart]] enabled
men to foresee, the unavoidable abuses [[abuse]] of such a [[constitution]], it must
have appeared so much the more excellent, as those who were charged
with the [[care]] of its preservation had themselves most interest in it;
for magistracy and the rights [[right]] attaching to it being based solely on
the fundamental laws [[law]], the magistrates would cease to be legitimate as
soon as these ceased to [[exist]]; the [[people]] would no longer owe them
obedience; and as not the magistrates, but the laws [[law]], are essential to
the being of a [[state]], the members of it would regain the [[right]] to their
natural [[liberty]].

if we reflect with ever so little attention on this [[subject]], we shall
find new arguments to confirm this [[truth]], and be convinced from the
very [[nature]] of the contract that it cannot be irrevocable: for, if
there were no superior [[power]] capable of ensuring the fidelity of the
contracting parties, or compelling them to perform their reciprocal
engagements, the parties would be sole judges [[judge]] in their own cause, and
each would always have a [[right]] to renounce the contract, as soon as he
found that the other had violated its terms, or that they no longer
suited his convenience. it is upon this [[principle]] that the [[right]] of
abdication may possibly be founded. now, if, as here, we consider
only what is [[human]] in this institution, it is [[certain]] that, if the
magistrate, who has all the [[power]] in his own hands, and appropriates
to himself all the advantages of the contract, has none the less a
right to renounce his [[authority]], the [[people]], who suffer for all the
faults of their [[chief]], must have a much [[better]] [[right]] to renounce their
dependence. but the terrible and innumerable quarrels and disorders
that would necessarily arise from so dangerous a [[privilege]], show,
more than anything else, how much [[human]] governments [[government]] stood in need of
a more solid basis than mere [[reason]], and how expedient it was for the
public tranquillity that the [[divine]] will should interpose to invest the
sovereign [[authority]] with a [[sacred]] and inviolable [[character]], which might
deprive subjects [[subject]] of the fatal [[right]] of disposing of it. if the world
had received no other advantages from [[religion]], this would be enough to
impose on [[men]] the [[duty]] of adopting and cultivating it, abuses [[abuse]] and all,
since it has been the means of saving more [[blood]] than fanaticism has
ever spilt. but let us [[follow]] the thread of our hypothesis.

the different forms of [[government]] owe their origin to the differing
degrees of inequality which existed between individuals [[individual]] at the time
of their institution. if there happened to be any one [[man]] among them
pre-eminent in [[power]], [[virtue]], riches [[rich]] or personal influence, he became
sole magistrate, and the [[state]] assumed the form of [[monarchy]]. if
several, nearly [[equal]] in point of eminence, stood above the rest, they
were elected jointly, and formed an [[aristocracy]]. again, among a people
who had deviated less from a [[state]] of [[nature]], and between whose fortune
or [[talents]] there was less disproportion, the supreme administration was
retained in [[common]], and a [[democracy]] was formed. it was discovered in
process of [[time]] which of these forms suited [[men]] the [[best]]. some peoples
remained altogether [[subject]] to the laws [[law]]; others soon came to obey their
magistrates. the [[citizens]] laboured to preserve their [[liberty]]; the
subjects, irritated at seeing others enjoying a blessing they had lost,
thought only of making slaves [[slave]] of their neighbours. in a word, on the
one side arose riches [[rich]] and conquests, and on the other [[happiness]] and i
virtue.

in these different governments [[government]], all the offices were at first elective;
and when the influence of [[wealth]] was out of the [[question]], the
preference was given to [[merit]], which gives a [[natural]] ascendancy, and
to [[age]], which is experienced in [[business]] and deliberate in council.
the elders of the hebrews, the gerontes at sparta, the senate at [[rome]],
and the very etymology of our word seigneur, show how old [[age]] was once
held in veneration. but the more often the [[choice]] fell upon old [[men]],
the more often elections had to be repeated, and the more they became
a nuisance; intrigues set in, factions were formed, party feeling
grew--bitter, civil wars [[war]] broke out; the lives [[life]] of individuals [[individual]] were
sacrificed to the pretended [[happiness]] of the [[state]]; and at length men
were on the point of relapsing into their primitive [[anarchy]]. ambitious
chiefs profited by these circumstances to perpetuate their offices
in their own families [[family]]: at the same [[time]] the [[people]], already used to
dependence, ease, and the conveniences of [[life]], and already incapable
of breaking its fetters, agreed to an increase of its [[slavery]], in order
to secure its tranquillity. thus magistrates, having become hereditary,
contracted the habit of considering their offices as a [[family]] estate,
and themselves as proprietors of the communities [[community]] of which they were at
first only the officers, of regarding their fellow-citizens as their
slaves, and numbering them, like cattle, among their belongings, and of
calling themselves the equals [[equal]] of the gods and longs of kings [[king]].

if we [[follow]] the [[progress]] of inequality in these various revolutions [[revolution]],
we shall find that the establishment of laws [[law]] and of the [[right]] of
property was its first term, the institution of magistracy the second,
and the conversion of legitimate into arbitrary [[power]] the third and
last; so that the condition of [[rich]] and [[poor]] was authorised by the
first period; that of powerful and [[weak]] by the second; and only by the
third that of master and [[slave]], which is the [[last]] [[degree]] of inequality,
and the term at which all the rest remain, when they have got so far,
till the [[government]] is either entirely dissolved by new revolutions [[revolution]], or
brought back again to legitimacy.

to [[understand]] this [[progress]] as necessary we must consider not so much
the motives for the establishment of the [[body]] [[politic]], as the forms
it assumes in actuality, and the faults [[fault]] that necessarily attend it:
for the flaws which make social [[institutions]] necessary are the same
as make the [[abuse]] of them unavoidable. if we except sparta, where
the laws [[law]] were mainly concerned with the [[education]] of [[children]], and
where lycurgus established such morality as practically made laws
needless--for laws [[law]] as a [[rule]], being weaker than the [[passions]], restrain
men without altering them--it would not be difficult to prove that
every [[government]], which scrupulously complied with the ends for which
it was instituted, and guarded carefully against [[change]] and [[corruption]],
was set up unnecessarily. for a [[country]], in which no one either evaded
the laws [[law]] or made a [[bad]] use of magisterial [[power]], could require neither
laws nor magistrates.

political distinctions necessarily [[produce]] civil distinctions. the
growing equality between the chiefs [[chief]] and the [[people]] is soon [[felt]] by
individuals, and modified in a thousand ways according to [[passions]],
talents and circumstances. the magistrate could not usurp any
illegitimate [[power]], without giving distinction to the creatures with
whom he must share it. besides, individuals [[individual]] only allow themselves
to be [[oppressed]] so far as they are hurried on by blind [[ambition]],
and, looking rather below than above them, come to [[love]] authority
more than independence, and submit to [[slavery]], that they may in turn
enslave others. it is no easy matter to reduce to [[obedience]] a man
who has no [[ambition]] to command; nor would the most adroit politician
find it possible to enslave a [[people]] whose only [[desire]] was to be
independent. but inequality easily makes its way among cowardly and
ambitious minds [[mind]], which are ever ready to run the risks of [[fortune]], and
almost indifferent whether they command or obey, as it is favourable
or adverse. thus, there must have been; a [[time]], when the [[eyes]] of the
people were so fascinated, that their rulers had only to say to the
least of [[men]], "be [[great]], you and all your [[posterity]]," to make him
immediately appear [[great]] in the [[eyes]] of every one as well as in his
own. his descendants took still more upon them, in proportion to their
distance from him; the more obscure; and uncertain the cause, the
greater the effect: the greater--the number of idlers one could count
in a [[family]], the more illustrious it was held to be.

if this were the place to go into details, i could readily explain
how, even without the intervention of [[government]], inequality of
credit and [[authority]] became unavoidable among private persons [[person]], as
soon as their union in a [[single]] [[society]] made them compare themselves
one with another, and take into account the differences which they
found out from the continual intercourse every [[man]] had to have with
his neighbours.[8] these differences are of several kinds [[kind]]; but
riches, nobility or rank, [[power]] and personal [[merit]] being the principal
distinctions by which [[men]] form an estimate of each other in [[society]],
i could prove that the harmony or conflict of these different forces
is the surest indication of the [[good]] or [[bad]] [[constitution]] of a [[state]].
i could show that among these four kinds [[kind]] of inequality, personal
qualities being the origin of all the others, [[wealth]] is the one to
which they are all reduced in the end; for, as riches [[rich]] tend most
immediately to the [[prosperity]] of individuals [[individual]], and are easiest to
communicate, they are used to purchase every other distinction. by this
observation we are enabled to [[judge]] pretty exactly how far a people
has departed from its primitive [[constitution]], and of its progress
towards the extreme term of [[corruption]]. i could explain how much
this universal [[desire]] for [[reputation]], honours [[honour]] and advancement, which
inflames us all, exercises and holds up to comparison our faculties and
powers; how it excites and multiplies our [[passions]], and, by creating
universal competition and rivalry, or rather enmity, among [[men]],
occasions numberless failures, successes and disturbances of all kinds
by making so many aspirants run the same course. i could show that it
is to this [[desire]] of being talked about, and this unremitting rage of
distinguishing ourselves, that we owe the [[best]] and the worst things we
possess, both our virtues [[virtue]] and our vices [[vice]], our [[science]] and our errors,
our conquerors and our [[philosophers]]; that is to say, a [[great]] many bad
things, and a very few [[good]] ones. in a word, i could prove that, if
we have a few [[rich]] and powerful [[men]] on the pinnacle of [[fortune]] and
grandeur, while the crowd grovels in want and obscurity, it is because
the former prize what they enjoy only in so far as others are destitute
of it; and because, without changing their condition, they would cease
to be [[happy]] the moment the [[people]] ceased to be wretched.

these details alone, however, would furnish matter for a considerable
work, in which the advantages and disadvantages of every [[kind]] of
government might be weighed, as they are related to [[man]] in the state
of [[nature]], and at the same [[time]] all the different aspects, under which
inequality has up to the [[present]] appeared, or may appear in ages [[age]] yet
to come, according to the [[nature]] of the several governments [[government]], and the
alterations which [[time]] must unavoidably [[occasion]] in them, might be
demonstrated. we should then see the multitude [[oppressed]] from within,
in consequence of the very precautions it had taken to guard against
foreign [[tyranny]]. we should see oppression continually gain ground
without it being possible for the [[oppressed]] to [[know]] where it would
stop, or what legitimate means was left them of checking its [[progress]].
we should see the rights [[right]] of [[citizens]], and the [[freedom]] of nations
slowly extinguished, and the complaints, protests and appeals of the
weak treated as seditious murmurings. we should see the [[honour]] of
defending the [[common]] cause confined by statecraft to a mercenary part
of the [[people]]. we should see taxes made necessary by such means, and
the disheartened husbandman deserting his fields even in the midst of
peace, and leaving the plough to gird on the [[sword]]. we should see fatal
and capricious codes of [[honour]] established; and the champions of their
country sooner or later becoming its enemies [[enemy]], and for ever holding
their daggers to the breasts of their fellow-citizens. the [[time]] would
come when they would be heard saying to the oppressor of their country--

    _pectore si fratris gladium juguloque parentis_
    _condere me jubeas, gravidæque in viscera partu_
    _conjugis, invitâ peragam tamen omnia dextrâ._
                                       lucan. i, 376.

from [[great]] inequality of fortunes [[fortune]] and conditions, from the vast variety
of [[passions]] and of [[talents]], of useless and pernicious [[arts]], of vain
sciences, would arise a multitude of prejudices equally contrary to
reason, [[happiness]] and [[virtue]]. we should see the magistrates fomenting
everything that might weaken [[men]] [[united]] in [[society]], by promoting
dissension among them; everything that might sow in it the seeds of
actual division, while it gave [[society]] the air of harmony; everything
that might inspire the different ranks of [[people]] with mutual [[hatred]] and
distrust, by setting the rights [[right]] and interests of one against those of
another, and so strengthen the [[power]] which comprehended them all.

it is from the midst of this disorder and these revolutions [[revolution]], that
despotism, gradually raising up its hideous head and devouring
everything that remained sound and untainted in any part of the [[state]],
would at length trample on both the laws [[law]] and the [[people]], and establish
itself on the ruins of the [[republic]]. the times [[time]] which immediately
preceded this [[last]] [[change]] would be times [[time]] of trouble and calamity; but
at length the monster would swallow up everything, and the [[people]] would
no longer have either chiefs [[chief]] or laws [[law]], but only tyrants [[tyrant]]. from this
moment there would be no [[question]] of [[virtue]] or morality; for despotism
_cui ex honesto nulla est spes_, wherever it prevails, admits no other
master; it no sooner speaks than probity and [[duty]] lose their weight and
blind [[obedience]] is the only [[virtue]] which slaves [[slave]] can still practise.

this is the [[last]] term of inequality, the extreme points that closes
the circle, and meets that from which we set out. here all private
persons return to their first equality, because they are nothing; and,
subjects having no [[law]] but the will of their master, and their master
no restraint but his [[passions]], all notions of [[good]] and all principles
of equity again vanish. there is here a complete return to the [[law]] of
the strongest, and so to a new [[state]] of [[nature]], differing from that we
set out from; for the one was a [[state]] of [[nature]] in its first purity,
while this is the consequence of excessive [[corruption]]. there is so
little difference between the two states in other respects [[respect]], and the
contract of [[government]] is so completely dissolved by despotism, that
the despot is master only so long as he remains the strongest; as soon
as he can be expelled, he has no [[right]] to [[complain]] of [[violence]]. the
popular insurrection that ends in the [[death]] or deposition of a sultan
is as lawful an act as those by which he disposed, the day before, of
the lives [[life]] and fortunes [[fortune]] of his subjects [[subject]]. as he was maintained by force
alone, it is [[force]] alone that overthrows him. thus everything takes
place according to the [[natural]] order; and, whatever may be the result
of such frequent and precipitate revolutions [[revolution]], no one [[man]] has [[reason]] to
complain of the [[injustice]] of another, but only of his own ill-fortune
or indiscretion.

if the reader thus discovers and retraces the lost and forgotten road,
by which [[man]] must have passed from the [[state]] of [[nature]] to the state
of [[society]]; if he carefully restores, along with the intermediate
situations which i have just described, those which want of [[time]] has
compelled me to suppress, or my [[imagination]] has failed to suggest,
he cannot fail to be struck by the vast distance which separates the
two states. it is in tracing this slow succession that he will find
the solution of a number of problems of [[politics]] and morals [[moral]], which
philosophers cannot settle. he will [[feel]] that, [[men]] being different in
different ages [[age]], the [[reason]] why diogenes could not find a [[man]] was that
he sought among his contemporaries a [[man]] of an earlier period. he will
see that cato died with [[rome]] and [[liberty]], because he did not fit the
age in which he lived; the [[greatest]] of [[men]] served only to astonish a
world which he would certainly have ruled, had he lived five hundred
years sooner. in a word, he will explain how the [[soul]] and the passions
of [[men]] insensibly [[change]] their very [[nature]]; why our wants and pleasures
in the end seek new objects; and why, the original [[man]] having vanished
by degrees [[degree]], [[society]] offers to us only an assembly of artificial [[men]] and
factitious [[passions]], which are the [[work]] of all these new relations, and
without any real foundation in [[nature]]. we are taught nothing on this
subject, by reflection, that is not entirely confirmed by observation.
the savage and the civilised [[man]] differ so much in the bottom of
their hearts [[heart]] and in their inclinations, that what constitutes the
supreme [[happiness]] of one would reduce the other to despair. the former
breathes only [[peace]] and [[liberty]]; he desires [[desire]] only to [[live]] and be free
from [[labour]]; even the _ataraxia_ of the stoic falls far short of his
profound indifference to every other object. civilised [[man]], on the
other hand, is always moving, sweating, toiling and racking his brains
to find still more laborious occupations: he goes on in drudgery to his
last moment, and even seeks [[death]] to put himself in a position to [[live]],
or renounces [[life]] to acquire immortality. he pays [[pay]] his court to [[men]] in
power, whom he hates, and to the wealthy, whom he despises; he stops at
nothing to have the [[honour]] of serving them; he is not ashamed to value
himself on his own meanness and their protection; and, proud of his
slavery, he speaks with disdain of those, who have not the [[honour]] of
sharing it. what a sight would the perplexing and envied labours [[labour]] of a
european minister of [[state]] [[present]] to the [[eyes]] of a caribean! how many
cruel deaths [[death]] would not this indolent savage prefer to the horrors of
such a [[life]], which is seldom even sweetened by the [[pleasure]] of doing
good! but, for him to see into the motives of all this solicitude, the
words _power_ and _reputation_, would have to bear some meaning in his
mind; he would have to [[know]] that there are [[men]] who set a value on the
opinion of the rest of the [[world]]; who can be made [[happy]] and satisfied
with themselves rather on the testimony of other [[people]] than on their
own. in reality, the source, of all these differences is, that the
savage lives [[life]] within himself, while social [[man]] lives [[life]] constantly outside
himself, and only knows [[know]] how to [[live]] in the [[opinion]] of others, so that
he seems to receive the [[consciousness]] of his own existence merely
from the [[judgment]] of others concerning him. it is not to my present
purpose to insist on the indifference to [[good]] and [[evil]] which arises
from this disposition, in spite of our many fine works [[work]] on morality,
or to show how, everything being reduced to appearances, there is but
art and mummery in even [[honour]], [[friendship]], [[virtue]], and often vice
itself, of which we at length learn the secret of boasting; to show,
in short, how, always asking others what, we are, and never daring
to ask ourselves, in the midst of so much [[philosophy]], [[humanity]] and
civilisation, and of such sublime codes of morality, we have nothing
to show for ourselves but a frivolous and deceitful appearance, honour
without [[virtue]], [[reason]] without [[wisdom]], and [[pleasure]] without [[happiness]].
it is sufficient that i have proved that this is not by any means the
original [[state]] of [[man]], but that it is merely the spirit of [[society]], and
the inequality which [[society]] produces [[produce]], that thus transform and alter
all our [[natural]] inclinations.

i have endeavoured to trace the origin and [[progress]] of inequality, and
the institution and [[abuse]] of [[political]] societies [[society]], as far as these are
capable of being deduced from the [[nature]] of [[man]] merely by the light
of [[reason]], and independently of those [[sacred]] dogmas which give the
sanction of [[divine]] [[right]] to [[sovereign]] [[authority]]. it follows from this
survey that, as there is hardly any inequality in the [[state]] of [[nature]],
all the inequality which now prevails owes its [[strength]] and [[growth]] to
the [[development]] of our faculties and the advance of the [[human]] [[mind]],
and becomes at [[last]] permanent and legitimate by the establishment
of [[property]] and laws [[law]]. secondly, it follows that [[moral]] inequality
authorised by positive [[right]] alone, clashes with [[natural]] [[right]],
whenever it is not proportionate to physical inequality; a distinction
which sufficiently determines what we ought to [[think]] of that species
of inequality which prevails in all civilised countries [[country]]; since it is
plainly contrary to the [[law]] of [[nature]], however defined, that children
should command old [[men]], fools [[fool]] [[wise]] [[men]], and that the privileged
few should gorge themselves with superfluities, while the starving
multitude are in want of the bare necessities of [[life]].

both [[rich]] and [[poor]], shocked at their new-found ills, would fly from
wealth, and lose what they had sought.

the [[monarchy]] of [[spain]], 1667.

[8] distributive [[justice]] would oppose this rigorous equality of the
state of [[nature]], even were it practicable in civil [[society]]; as all
the members of the [[state]] owe it their services in proportion to their
talents and abilities, they ought, on their side, to be distinguished
and favoured in proportion to the services they have actually rendered.
it is in this sense we must [[understand]] that passage of isocrates, in
which he extols the primitive athenians, for having determined which
of the two kinds [[kind]] of equality was the most useful, viz. that which
consists in dividing the same advantages indiscriminately among all the
citizens, or that which consists in distributing them to each according
to his deserts. these able politicians, adds the orator, banishing
that [[unjust]] inequality which makes no distinction between [[good]] and bad
men, adhered inviolably to that which rewards [[reward]] and punishes every man
according to his deserts.

but in the first place, there never existed a [[society]], however corrupt
some may have become, where no difference was made between the good
and the [[bad]]; and with regard to morality, where no measures can be
prescribed by [[law]] exact enough to serve as a practical [[rule]] for a
magistrate, it is with [[great]] prudence that, in order not to leave the
fortune or quality of the [[citizens]] to his discretion, it prohibits him
from passing [[judgment]] on persons [[person]] and confines his [[judgment]] to actions.
only morals [[moral]] such as those of the ancient romans can bear censors, and
such a tribunal among us would throw everything into confusion. the
difference between [[good]] and [[bad]] [[men]] is determined by [[public]] esteem; the
magistrate being strictly a [[judge]] of [[right]] alone; whereas the [[public]] is
the truest [[judge]] of morals [[moral]], and is of such integrity and penetration on
this head, that although it may be sometimes deceived, it can never be
corrupted. the rank of [[citizens]] ought, therefore, to be regulated, not
according to their personal merit--for this would put it in the power
of the magistrate to apply the [[law]] almost arbitrarily--but according to
the actual services done to the [[state]], which are capable of being more
exactly estimated.




appendix[1]


a famous author, reckoning up the [[good]] and [[evil]] of [[human]] [[life]], and
comparing the aggregates, finds that our pains [[pain]] greatly exceed our
pleasures: so that, all things considered, [[human]] [[life]] is not at all a
valuable gift. this conclusion does not surprise me; for the writer
drew all his arguments from [[man]] in civilisation. had he gone back to
the [[state]] of [[nature]], his inquiries would clearly have had a different
result, and [[man]] would have been seen to be [[subject]] to very few evils
not of his own creation. it has indeed cost us not a little trouble
to make ourselves as wretched as we are. when we consider, on the one
hand, the immense labours [[labour]] of [[mankind]], the many sciences [[science]] brought to
perfection, the [[arts]] [[invented]], the powers [[power]] employed, the deeps filled
up, the mountains levelled, the rocks shattered, the rivers made
navigable, the tracts of [[land]] cleared, the lakes emptied, the marshes
drained, the enormous structures erected on [[land]], and the teeming
vessels that cover the sea; and, on the other hand, estimate with ever
so little [[thought]], the real advantages that have accrued from all these
works to [[mankind]], we cannot [[help]] being amazed at the vast disproportion
there is between these things, and deploring the infatuation of [[man]],
which, to gratify his silly [[pride]] and [[vain]] self-admiration, induces him
eagerly to pursue all the miseries he is capable of feeling, though
beneficent [[nature]] had kindly placed them out of his way.

that [[men]] are actually wicked, a [[sad]] and continual [[experience]] of them
proves beyond [[doubt]]: but all the same, i [[think]] i've shown that [[man]] is
naturally [[good]]. what then can have depraved him to such an extent,
except the changes [[change]] that have happened in his [[constitution]], the advances
he has made, and the [[knowledge]] he has acquired? we may [[admire]] human
society as much as we please; it will be none the less true that it
necessarily leads [[men]] to hate each other in proportion as their
interests clash, and to do one another apparent services, while they
are really doing every imaginable mischief. what can be [[thought]] of a
relation, in which the interest of every [[individual]] dictates rules
directly opposite to those the [[public]] [[reason]] dictates to the community
in general--in which every [[man]] finds his [[profit]] in the misfortunes of
his neighbour? there is not perhaps any [[man]] in a comfortable position
who has not greedy heirs, and perhaps even [[children]], secretly wishing
for his [[death]]; not a ship at sea, of which the loss would not be good
news to some merchant or other; not a house, which some debtor of bad
faith would not be glad to see reduced to ashes with all the papers
it contains; not a nation which does not rejoice at the disasters
that befall its neighbours. thus it is that we find our advantage in
the misfortunes of our fellow-creatures, and that the loss of one man
almost always constitutes the [[prosperity]] of another. but it is still
more pernicious that [[public]] calamities are the objects of the hopes [[hope]] and
expectations of innumerable individuals [[individual]]. some [[desire]] sickness, some
mortality, some [[war]], and some famine. i have seen [[men]] wicked enough to
weep for [[sorrow]] at the prospect of a plentiful season; and the great
and fatal [[fire]] of [[london]], which cost so many unhappy persons [[person]] their
lives or their fortunes [[fortune]], made the fortunes [[fortune]] of perhaps ten thousand
others. i [[know]] that montaigne; censures demades the athenian for having
caused to be i punished a workman who, by selling his coffins very
dear, was a [[great]] gainer by the deaths [[death]] of his fellow-citizens; but, the
reason alleged by montaigne being that everybody ought to be punished,
my point is clearly confirmed by it. let us penetrate, therefore, the
superficial appearances of benevolence, and survey what passes in the
inmost recesses of the [[heart]]. let us reflect what must be the [[state]] of
things, when [[men]] are forced to caress and [[destroy]] one another at the
same [[time]]; when they are born enemies [[enemy]] by [[duty]], and knaves by interest.
it will perhaps be said that [[society]] is so formed that every [[man]] gains
by serving the rest. that would be all very well, if he did not gain
still more by injuring them. there is no legitimate [[profit]] so [[great]],
that it cannot be greatly exceeded by what may be made illegitimately;
we always gain more by hurting our neighbours than by doing them [[good]].
nothing is required but to [[know]] how to act with impunity; and to this
end the powerful employ all their [[strength]], and the [[weak]] all their
cunning.

savage [[man]], when he has dined, is at [[peace]] with all [[nature]], and the
friend of all his fellow-creatures. if a dispute arises about a meal,
he rarely comes to blows, without having first compared the difficulty
of conquering his antagonist with the trouble of finding subsistence
elsewhere: and, as [[pride]] does not come in, it all ends in a few blows;
the victor eats, and the vanquished seeks provision somewhere else,
and all is at [[peace]]. the case is quite different with [[man]] in the
state of [[society]], for whom first necessaries have to be provided, and
then superfluities; delicacies [[follow]] next, then immense [[wealth]], then
subjects, and then slaves [[slave]]. he enjoys not a moments relaxation; and what
is yet stranger, the less [[natural]] and pressing his wants, the more
headstrong are his [[passions]], and, still worse, the more he has it in
his [[power]] to gratify them; so that after a long course of [[prosperity]],
after having swallowed up treasures and ruined multitudes, the hero
ends up by cutting every throat till he finds himself, at [[last]], sole
master of the [[world]]. such is in miniature the [[moral]] picture, if not
of [[human]] [[life]], at least of the secret pretensions of the [[heart]] of
civilised [[man]].

compare without partiality the [[state]] of the citizen with that of the
savage, and trace out, if you can, how many inlets the former has
opened to [[pain]] and [[death]], besides those of his vices [[vice]], his wants and his
misfortunes. if you reflect on the mental afflictions that prey on us,
the [[violent]] [[passions]] that waste and exhaust us, the excessive labour
with which the [[poor]] are burdened, the still more dangerous indolence
to which the wealthy give themselves up, so that the [[poor]] perish of
want, and the [[rich]] of surfeit; if you reflect but a moment on the
heterogeneous mixtures and pernicious seasonings of foods; the corrupt
state in which they are frequently eaten; on the adulteration of
medicines, the wiles of those who sell them, the mistakes of those who
administer them, and the poisonous vessels in which they are prepared;
on the epidemics bred by foul air in consequence of [[great]] numbers of
men being crowded together, or those which are caused by our delicate
way of living, by our passing from our houses into the open air and
back again, by the putting on or throwing off our clothes with too
little [[care]], and by all the precautions which sensuality has converted
into necessary habits, and the neglect of which sometimes costs us
our [[life]] or health; if you take into account the conflagrations and
earthquakes, which, devouring or overwhelming whole cities [[city]], destroy
the inhabitants by thousands; in a word, if you add together all the
dangers with which these causes are always threatening us, you will
see how dearly [[nature]] makes us [[pay]] for the contempt with which we have
treated her lessons.

i shall not here repeat, what i have elsewhere said of the calamities
of [[war]]; but [[wish]] that those, who have sufficient [[knowledge]], were
willing or bold enough to make [[public]] the details of the villainies
committed in armies [[army]] by the contractors for commissariat, and hospitals:
we should see plainly that their monstrous frauds, already none too
well concealed, which cripple the finest armies [[army]] in less than no [[time]],
occasion greater destruction among the soldiers than the swords [[sword]] of the
enemy.

the number of [[people]] who perish annually at sea, by famine, the scurvy,
pirates, [[fire]] and shipwrecks, affords matter for another shocking
calculation. we must also place to the credit of the establishment
of [[property]], and consequently to the institution of [[society]],
assassinations, poisonings, highway robberies, and even the punishments
inflicted on the wretches guilty of these crimes; which, though
expedient to prevent greater evils [[evil]], yet by making the murder of one man
cost the lives [[life]] of two or more, double the loss to the [[human]] [[race]].

what shameful methods are sometimes practised to prevent the birth of
men, and [[cheat]] [[nature]]; either by brutal and depraved appetites which
insult her most beautiful work--appetites unknown to savages or mere
animals, which can spring only from the [[corrupt]] [[imagination]] of mankind
in civilised countries [[country]]; or by secret abortions, the fitting effects
of debauchery and vitiated notions of [[honour]]; or by the exposure or
murder of multitudes of infants, who fall victims to the [[poverty]] of
their parents, or the cruel shame of their mothers [[mother]]; or, finally, by
the mutilation of unhappy wretches, part of whose [[life]], with their
hope of [[posterity]], is given up to [[vain]] singing, or, still worse, the
brutal [[jealousy]] of other [[men]]: a mutilation which, in the [[last]] case,
becomes a double outrage against [[nature]] from the treatment of those
who suffer it, and from the use to which they are destined. but is
it not a thousand times [[time]] more [[common]] and more dangerous for paternal
rights openly to offend against [[humanity]]? how many [[talents]] have not
been thrown away, and inclinations forced, by the unwise constraint of
fathers? how many [[men]], who would have distinguished themselves in a
fitting estate, have died dishonoured and wretched in another for which
they had no taste! how many [[happy]], but unequal, marriages [[marriage]] have been
broken or disturbed, and how many chaste wives [[wife]] have been dishonoured,
by an order of things continually in contradiction with that of nature!
how many [[good]] and [[virtuous]] husbands and wives [[wife]] are reciprocally punished
for having been ill-assorted! how many [[young]] and unhappy victims of
their parents' avarice plunge into [[vice]], or pass their melancholy
days in tears, groaning in the indissoluble bonds which their hearts
repudiate and gold alone has formed! fortunate sometimes are those
whose [[courage]] and [[virtue]] remove them from [[life]] before inhuman violence
makes them spend it in crime or in despair. [[forgive]] me, [[father]] and
mother, whom i shall ever regret: my complaint embitters your griefs;
but would they might be an eternal and terrible [[example]] to every one
who dares, in the name of [[nature]], to violate her most [[sacred]] [[right]].

if i have spoken only of those ill-starred unions which are the
result of our [[system]], is it to be [[thought]] that those over which love
and sympathy preside are [[free]] from disadvantages? what if i should
undertake to show [[humanity]] attacked in its very source, and even in
the most [[sacred]] of all ties, in which [[fortune]] is consulted before
nature, and, the disorders of [[society]] confounding all [[virtue]] and [[vice]],
continence becomes a [[criminal]] precaution, and a refusal to give life
to a fellow-creature, an act of [[humanity]]? but, without drawing aside
the veil which hides all these horrors, let us content ourselves with
pointing out the [[evil]] which others will have to remedy.

to all this add the multiplicity of unhealthy trades [[trade]], which shorten
men's lives [[life]] or [[destroy]] their bodies [[body]], such as working in the mines,
and the preparing of metals and minerals, particularly lead, copper,
mercury, cobalt, and arsenic: add those other dangerous trades [[trade]] which
are daily fatal to many tilers, carpenters, masons and miners: put all
these together and we can see, in the establishment and [[perfection]] of
societies, the reasons [[reason]] for that diminution of our [[species]], which has
been noticed by many [[philosophers]].

luxury, which cannot be prevented among [[men]] who are tenacious of their
own convenience and of the [[respect]] paid them by others, soon completes
the [[evil]] [[society]] had begun, and, under the pretence of giving bread to
the [[poor]], whom it should never have made such, impoverishes all the
rest, and sooner or later depopulates the [[state]]. luxury is a remedy
much worse than the disease it sets up to cure; or rather it is in
itself the [[greatest]] of all evils [[evil]], for every [[state]], [[great]] or small:
for, in order to maintain all the servants and vagabonds it creates,
it brings oppression and ruin on the citizen and the labourer; it is
like those scorching winds, which, covering the trees and plants with
devouring insects, deprive useful animals of their subsistence and
spread famine and [[death]] wherever they blow.

from [[society]] and the luxury to which it gives birth arise the liberal
and mechanical [[arts]], commerce, letters, and all those superfluities
which make industry flourish, and enrich and ruin nations. the reason
for such destruction is plain. it is easy to see, from the very nature
of agriculture, that it must be the least lucrative of all the [[arts]];
for, its [[produce]] being the most universally necessary, the price must
be proportionate to the abilities of the very poorest of [[mankind]].

from the same [[principle]] may be deduced this [[rule]], that the [[arts]] in
general are more lucrative in proportion as they are less useful; and
that, in the end, the most useful becomes the most neglected. from this
we may learn what to [[think]] of the real advantages of industry and the
actual effects of its [[progress]].

such are the sensible causes of all the miseries, into which opulence
at length plunges the most celebrated nations. in proportion as arts
and industry flourish, the despised husbandman, burdened with the
taxes necessary for the support of luxury, and condemned to pass his
days between [[labour]] and [[hunger]], forsakes his native field, to seek in
towns the bread he ought to carry thither. the more our [[capital]] cities
strike the vulgar eye with admiration, the greater [[reason]] is there to
lament the sight of the abandoned countryside, the large tracts of land
that [[lie]] uncultivated, the roads crowded with unfortunate citizens
turned beggars or highwaymen, and doomed to end their wretched lives
either on a dunghill or on the gallows. thus the [[state]] grows [[rich]] on
the one hand, and feeble and depopulated on the other; the mightiest
monarchies, after having taken immense pains [[pain]] to enrich and depopulate
themselves, fall at [[last]] a prey to some [[poor]] nation, which has yielded
to the fatal temptation of invading them, and then, growing opulent and
weak in its turn, is itself invaded and ruined by some other.

let any one inform us what produced the swarms of barbarians, who
overran [[europe]], [[asia]] and [[africa]] for so many ages [[age]]. was their prodigious
increase due to their industry and [[arts]], to the [[wisdom]] of their laws [[law]],
or to the excellence of their [[political]] [[system]]? let the learned tell us
why, instead of multiplying to such a [[degree]], these fierce and brutal
men, without sense or [[science]], without [[education]], without restraint,
did not [[destroy]] each other hourly in quarrelling over the productions
of their fields and woods. let them tell us how these wretches could
have the presumption to oppose such clever [[people]] as we were, so well
trained in [[military]] discipline, and possessed of such excellent laws
and [[institutions]]: and why, since [[society]] has been brought to perfection
in northern countries [[country]], and so much pains [[pain]] taken to instruct their
inhabitants in their social duties [[duty]] and in the art [[arts]] of living happily
and peaceably together, we see them no longer [[produce]] such numberless
hosts as they used once to send forth to be the plague and terror of
other nations. i [[fear]] some one may at [[last]] [[answer]] me by saying, that
all these fine things, [[arts]], sciences [[science]] and laws [[law]], were wisely [[invented]] by
men, as a salutary plague, to prevent the too [[great]] multiplication of
mankind, lest the [[world]], which was given us for a habitation, should in
time be too small for its inhabitants.

what, then, is to be done? must societies [[society]] be totally abolished? must
_meum_ and _tuum_ be annihilated, and must we return again to the
forests to [[live]] among beasts? this is a deduction in the manner of
my adversaries, which i would as soon anticipate as let them have the
shame of drawing. o you, who have never heard the voice of [[heaven]],
who [[think]] [[man]] destined only to [[live]] this little [[life]] and [[die]] in
peace; you, who can resign in the midst of populous cities [[city]] your fatal
acquisitions, your restless spirits, your [[corrupt]] hearts [[heart]] and endless
desires; resume, since it depends entirely on yourselves, your ancient
and primitive innocence: retire to the woods, there to lose the sight
and remembrance of the crimes of your contemporaries; and be not
apprehensive of degrading your [[species]], by renouncing its advances in
order to renounce its vices [[vice]]. as for [[men]] like me whose [[passions]] have
destroyed their original simplicity, who can no longer subsist on
plants or acorns, or [[live]] without laws [[law]] and magistrates those who were
honoured in their first [[father]] with supernatural instructions; those
who discover, in the design of giving [[human]] actions at the start a
morality which they must otherwise have been so long in acquiring, the
reason for a precept in itself indifferent and inexplicable on every
other [[system]]; those, in short, who are persuaded that the [[divine]] being
has called all [[mankind]] to be partakers in the [[happiness]] and perfection
of celestial intelligences, all these will endeavour to [[merit]] the
eternal prize they are to expect from the practice of those virtues [[virtue]],
which they make themselves [[follow]] in learning to [[know]] them. they will
respect the [[sacred]] bonds of their respective communities [[community]]; they will
love theft fellow-citizens, and serve them with all their might: they
will scrupulously obey the laws [[law]], and all those who make or administer
them; they will particularly [[honour]] those [[wise]] and [[good]] princes [[prince]], who
find means of preventing, curing or even palliating all these evils [[evil]] and
abuses, by which we are constantly threatened; they will animate the
zeal of their deserving rulers, by showing them, without [[flattery]] or
fear, the importance of their office and the severity of their [[duty]].
but they will not therefore have less contempt for a [[constitution]] that
cannot support itself without the aid of so many splendid characters [[character]],
much oftener wished for than found; and from which, notwithstanding all
their pains [[pain]] and solicitude, there always arise more real calamities
than even apparent advantages.

a discourse on [[political]] economy



the word economy, or œconomy, is derived from _οἰκός, a house_,
and _νόμος, law_, and meant originally only the [[wise]] and legitimate
government of the house for the [[common]] [[good]] of the whole [[family]]. the
meaning of the term was then extended to the [[government]] of that great
family, the [[state]]. to distinguish these two senses of the word, the
latter is called _general_ or _political_ economy, and the former
domestic or particular economy. the first only is discussed in the
present discourse.

even if there were as close an analogy as many authors maintain between
the [[state]] and the [[family]], it would not [[follow]] that the rules [[rule]] of conduct
proper for one of these societies [[society]] would be also proper for the other.
they differ too much in extent to be regulated in the same manner; and
there will always be a [[great]] difference between domestic [[government]], in
which a [[father]] can see everything for himself, and civil [[government]],
where the [[chief]] sees hardly anything save through the [[eyes]] of others.
to put both on an equality in this [[respect]], the [[talents]], [[strength]], and
all the faculties of the [[father]] would have to increase in proportion to
the size of his [[family]], and the [[soul]] of a powerful monarch would have
to be, to that of an ordinary [[man]], as the extent of his [[empire]] is to
that of a private person's estate.

but how could the [[government]] of the [[state]] be like that of the [[family]],
when the basis on which they rest is so different? the [[father]] being
physically stronger than his [[children]], his paternal [[authority]], as long
as they need his protection, may be reasonably said to be established
by [[nature]]. but in the [[great]] [[family]], all the members of which are
naturally [[equal]], the [[political]] [[authority]], being purely arbitrary as far
as its institution is concerned, can be founded only on conventions,
and the magistrate can have no [[authority]] over the rest, except by
virtue of the laws [[law]]. the duties [[duty]] of a [[father]] are dictated to him by
natural feelings, and in a manner that seldom allows him to neglect
them. for rulers there is no such [[principle]], and they are really
obliged to the [[people]] only by what they themselves have promised to
do, and the [[people]] have therefore a [[right]] to require of them. another
more important difference is that since the [[children]] have nothing but
what they receive from their [[father]], it is plain that all the rights
of [[property]] belong to him, or emanate from him; but quite the opposite
is the case in the [[great]] [[family]], where the general administration is
established only to secure [[individual]] [[property]], which is antecedent to
it. the principal object of the [[work]] of the whole house is to preserve
and increase the patrimony of the [[father]], in order that he may be able
some day to distribute it among his [[children]] without impoverishing
them; whereas the [[wealth]] of the exchequer is only a means, often ill
understood, of keeping the individuals [[individual]] in [[peace]] and plenty. in a word,
the little [[family]] is destined to be extinguished, and to resolve itself
some day into several families [[family]] of a similar [[nature]]; but the great
family, being constituted to endure for ever in the same condition,
need not, like the small one, increase for the [[purpose]] of multiplying,
but need only maintain itself; and it can easily be proved that any
increase does it more harm than [[good]].

in the [[family]], it is clear, for several reasons [[reason]] which [[lie]] in its very
nature, that the [[father]] ought to command. in the first place, the
authority ought not to be equally divided between [[father]] and [[mother]];
the [[government]] must be [[single]], and in every division of [[opinion]] there
must be one preponderant voice to decide. secondly, however lightly
we may regard the disadvantages peculiar to [[women]], yet, as they
necessarily [[occasion]] intervals of inaction, this is a sufficient reason
for excluding them from this supreme [[authority]]: for when the balance
is perfectly even, a straw is enough to turn the scale. besides, the
husband ought to be able to superintend his wife's conduct, because
it is of importance for him to be assured that the [[children]], whom he
is obliged to acknowledge and maintain, belong to no-one but himself.
thirdly, [[children]] should be [[obedient]] to their [[father]], at first of
necessity, and afterwards from gratitude: after having had their
wants satisfied by him during one half of their lives [[life]], they ought to
consecrate the other half to providing for his. fourthly, servants owe
him their services in exchange for the provision he makes for them,
though they may break off the bargain as soon as it ceases to suit
them. i say nothing here of [[slavery]], because it is contrary to [[nature]],
and cannot be authorised by any [[right]] or [[law]].

there is nothing of all this in [[political]] [[society]], in which the chief
is so far from having any [[natural]] interest in the [[happiness]] of the
individuals, that it is not uncommon for him to seek his own in their
misery. if the magistracy is hereditary, a [[community]] of [[men]] is often
governed by a child. if it be elective, innumerable inconveniences
arise from such election; while in both cases all the advantages of
paternity are lost. if you have but a [[single]] ruler, you [[lie]] at the
discretion of a master who has no [[reason]] to [[love]] you: and if you have
several, you must bear at once their [[tyranny]] and their divisions. in
a word, abuses [[abuse]] are inevitable and their consequences fatal in every
society where the [[public]] interest and the laws [[law]] have no [[natural]] [[force]],
and are perpetually attacked by personal interest and the [[passions]] of
the ruler and the members.

although the functions of the [[father]] of a [[family]] and those of the
chief magistrate ought to make for the same object, they must do so
in such different ways, and their [[duty]] and rights [[right]] are so essentially
distinct, that we cannot confound them without forming very false ideas
about the fundamental laws [[law]] of [[society]], and falling into errors which
are fatal to [[mankind]]. in [[fact]], if the voice of [[nature]] is the best
counsellor to which a [[father]] can listen in the discharge of his [[duty]],
for the magistrate it is a false guide, which continually prevents him
from performing his, and leads him on sooner or later to the ruin of
himself and of the [[state]], if he is not restrained by the most sublime
virtue. the only precaution necessary for the [[father]] of a [[family]] is to
guard himself against depravity, and prevent his [[natural]] inclinations
from being corrupted; whereas it is these themselves which [[corrupt]] the
magistrate. in order to act aright, the first has only to consult his
heart; the other becomes a traitor the moment he listens to his. even
his own [[reason]] should be suspect to him, nor should he [[follow]] any rule
other than the [[public]] [[reason]], which is the [[law]]. thus [[nature]] has made
a multitude of [[good]] fathers [[father]] of families [[family]]; but it is doubtful whether,
from the very beginning of the [[world]], [[human]] [[wisdom]] has made ten men
capable of governing their peers.

from all that has just been said, it follows that _public_ economy,
which is my [[subject]], has been rightly distinguished from _private_
economy, and that, the [[state]] having nothing in [[common]] with the family
except the obligations which their heads [[lie]] under of making both
of them [[happy]], the same rules [[rule]] of conduct cannot apply to both. i
have considered these few lines enough to overthrow the detestable
system which sir robert filmer has endeavoured to establish in his
_patriarcha_; a [[work]] to which two celebrated writers have done too much
honour in writing books [[book]] to refute it. moreover, this error is of very
long standing; for [[aristotle]] himself [[thought]] proper to combat it with
arguments which may be found in the first [[book]] of his _politics_.

i must here ask my readers to distinguish also between _public
economy_, which is my [[subject]] and which i call _government_, and the
supreme [[authority]], which i call _sovereignty_; a distinction which
consists in the [[fact]] that the latter has the [[right]] of legislation, and
in [[certain]] cases binds the [[body]] of the nation itself, while the former
has only the [[right]] of execution, and is binding only on individuals [[individual]].

i shall take the [[liberty]] of making use of a very [[common]], and in some
respects inaccurate, comparison, which will serve to illustrate my
meaning.

the [[body]] [[politic]], taken individually, may be considered as an
organised, living [[body]], resembling that of [[man]]. the [[sovereign]] power
represents the head; the laws [[law]] and customs are the brain, the source
of the nerves and seat of the understanding, will and senses, of
which the judges [[judge]] and magistrates are the organs: commerce, industry,
and agriculture are the mouth and stomach which prepare the common
subsistence; the [[public]] income is the [[blood]], which a prudent _economy_,
in performing the functions of the [[heart]], causes to distribute through
the whole [[body]] nutriment and [[life]]: the [[citizens]] are the [[body]] and the
members, which make the machine [[live]], move and [[work]]; and no part of
this machine can be damaged without the painful impression being at
once conveyed to the brain, if the animal is in a [[state]] of health.

the [[life]] of both bodies [[body]] is the [[self]] [[common]] to the whole, the reciprocal
sensibility and internal correspondence of all the parts. where this
communication ceases, where the formal unity disappears, and the
contiguous parts belong to one another only by juxtaposition, the man
is [[dead]], or the [[state]] is dissolved.

the [[body]] [[politic]], therefore, is also a [[moral]] being possessed of a will;
and this general will, which tends always to the preservation and
welfare of the whole and of every part, and is the source of the laws [[law]],
constitutes for all the members of the [[state]], in their relations to one
another and to it, the [[rule]] of what is just or [[unjust]]: a [[truth]] which
shows, by the way, how idly some writers have treated as theft the
subtlety prescribed to [[children]] at sparta for obtaining their frugal
repasts, as if everything ordained by the [[law]] were not lawful.

it is important to observe that this [[rule]] of [[justice]], though certain
with regard to all [[citizens]], may be defective with regard to
foreigners. the [[reason]] is clear. the will of the [[state]], though general
in relation to its own members, is no longer so in relation to other
states and their members, but becomes, for them, a particular and
individual will, which has its [[rule]] of [[justice]] in the [[law]] of [[nature]].
this, however, enters equally into the [[principle]] here laid down;
for in such a case, the [[great]] [[city]] of the [[world]] becomes the body
politic, whose general will is always the [[law]] of [[nature]], and of which
the different states and peoples [[people]] are [[individual]] members. from these
distinctions, applied to each [[political]] [[society]] and its members, are
derived the most [[certain]] and universal rules [[rule]], by which we can judge
whether a [[government]] is [[good]] or [[bad]], and in general of the morality of
all [[human]] actions.

every [[political]] [[society]] is composed of other smaller societies [[society]] of
different kinds [[kind]], each of which has its interests and its rules [[rule]] of
conduct: but those societies [[society]] which everybody perceives, because they
have an external and authorised form, are not the only ones that
actually [[exist]] in the [[state]]: all individuals [[individual]] who are [[united]] by a common
interest compose as many others, either transitory or permanent, whose
influence is none the less real because it is less apparent, and the
proper observation of whose various relations is the true [[knowledge]] of
public morals [[moral]] and manners. the influence of all these tacit or formal
associations causes, by the influence of their will, as many different
modifications of the [[public]] will. the will of these particular
societies has always two relations; for the members of the association,
it is a general will; for the [[great]] [[society]], it is a particular will;
and it is often [[right]] with regard to the first object, and [[wrong]] as to
the second. an [[individual]] may be a devout [[priest]], a brave soldier, or a
zealous senator, and yet a [[bad]] citizen. a particular resolution may be
advantageous to the smaller [[community]], but pernicious to the greater.
it is true that particular societies [[society]] being always subordinate to the
general [[society]] in preference to others, the [[duty]] of a citizen takes
precedence of that of a senator, and a man's [[man]] [[duty]] of that of a citizen:
but unhappily personal interest is always found in inverse ratio to
duty, and increases in proportion as the association grows narrower,
and the engagement less [[sacred]]; which irrefragably proves that the most
general will is always the must just also, and that the voice of the
people is in [[fact]] the voice of [[god]].

it does not [[follow]] that the [[public]] decisions are always equitable;
they may possibly, for reasons [[reason]] which i have given, not be so when they
have to do with foreigners. thus it is not impossible that a [[republic]],
though in itself well governed, should enter upon an [[unjust]] [[war]]. nor
is it less possible for the council of a [[democracy]] to pass unjust
decrees, and condemn the [[innocent]]; but this never happens unless the
people is seduced by private interests, which the credit or eloquence
of some clever persons [[person]] substitutes for those of the [[state]]; in which
case the general will will be one thing, and the result of the public
deliberation another. this is not contradicted by the case of the
athenian [[democracy]]; for [[athens]] was in [[fact]] not a [[democracy]], but a
very [[tyrannical]] [[aristocracy]], governed by [[philosophers]] and orators.
carefully determine what happens in every [[public]] deliberation, and it
will be seen that the general will is always for the [[common]] [[good]]; but
very often there is a secret division, a tacit confederacy, which, for
particular ends, causes the [[natural]] disposition of the assembly to be
set at nought. in such a case the [[body]] of [[society]] is really divided
into other bodies [[body]], the members of which acquire a general will, which
is [[good]] and just with [[respect]] to these new bodies [[body]], but [[unjust]] and bad
with regard to the whole, from which each is thus dismembered.

we see then how easy it is, by the [[help]] of these principles [[principle]], to explain
those apparent contradictions, which are noticed in the conduct of
many persons [[person]] who are scrupulously honest in some respects [[respect]], and cheats
and scoundrels in others, who trample under foot the most sacred
duties, and yet are faithful to the [[death]] to engagements that are often
illegitimate. thus the most depraved of [[men]] always [[pay]] some sort of
homage to [[public]] [[faith]]; and even robbers, who are the enemies [[enemy]] of virtue
in the [[great]] [[society]], [[pay]] some [[respect]] to the shadow of it in their
secret caves.

in establishing the general will as the first [[principle]] of public
_economy_, and the fundamental [[rule]] of [[government]], i have not thought
it necessary to inquire seriously whether the magistrates belong to the
people, or the [[people]] to the magistrates; or whether in [[public]] affairs
the [[good]] of the [[state]] should be taken into account, or only that of
its rulers. that [[question]] indeed has long been decided one way in
theory, and another in practice; and in general it would be ridiculous
to expect that those who are in [[fact]] masters will prefer any other
interest to their own. it would not be improper, therefore, further to
distinguish [[public]] _economy_ as popular or [[tyrannical]]. the former is
that of every [[state]], in which there reigns between the [[people]] and the
rulers unity of interest and will: the latter will necessarily exist
wherever the [[government]] and the [[people]] have different interests, and,
consequently, opposing wills. the rules [[rule]] of the latter are written at
length in the archives of [[history]], and in the satires of macchiavelli.
the rules [[rule]] of the former are found only in the writings of those
philosophers who venture to proclaim the rights [[right]] of [[humanity]].

i. the first and most important [[rule]] of legitimate or popular
government, that is to say, of [[government]] whose object is the [[good]] of
the [[people]], is therefore, as i have observed, to [[follow]] in everything
the general will. but to [[follow]] this will it is necessary to [[know]] it,
and above all to distinguish it from the particular will, beginning
with one's [[self]]: this distinction is always very difficult to make,
and only the most sublime [[virtue]] can afford sufficient illumination
for it. as, in order to will, it is necessary to be [[free]], a difficulty
no less [[great]] than the former arises--that of preserving at once the
public [[liberty]] and the [[authority]] of [[government]]. look into the motives
which have induced [[men]], once [[united]] by their [[common]] needs in a general
society, to unite themselves still more intimately by means of civil
societies: you will find no other motive than that of assuring the
property, [[life]] and [[liberty]] of each member by the protection of all.
but can [[men]] be forced to defend the [[liberty]] of any one among them,
without trespassing on that of others? and how can they provide for
the [[public]] needs, without alienating the [[individual]] [[property]] of those
who are forced to contribute to them? with whatever sophistry all this
may be covered over, it is [[certain]] that if any constraint can be laid
on my will, i am no longer [[free]], and that i am no longer master of my
own [[property]], if any one else can lay a hand on it. this difficulty,
which would have seemed insurmountable, has been removed, like the
first, by the most sublime of all [[human]] [[institutions]], or rather by a
divine inspiration, which teaches [[teach]] [[mankind]] to imitate here below the
unchangeable decrees of the deity. by what inconceivable art [[arts]] has a
means been found of making [[men]] [[free]] by making them [[subject]]; of using in
the service of the [[state]] the properties [[property]], the persons [[person]] and even the lives
of all its members, without constraining and without consulting them;
of confining their will by their own admission; of overcoming their
refusal by that [[consent]], and forcing them to punish themselves, when
they act against their own will? how can it be that all should obey,
yet nobody take upon him to command, and that all should serve, and
yet have no masters, but be the more [[free]], as, in apparent subjection,
each loses no part of his [[liberty]] but what might be hurtful; to that of
another? these wonders are the [[work]] of [[law]]. it is to [[law]] alone that men
owe [[justice]] and [[liberty]]. it is this salutary organ of the will of all
which establishes, in civil [[right]], the [[natural]] equality between [[men]].
it is this celestial voice which dictates to each citizen the precepts
of [[public]] [[reason]], and teaches [[teach]] him to act according to the rules [[rule]] of his
own [[judgment]], and not to behave inconsistently with himself. it is with
this voice alone that [[political]] rulers should speak when they command;
for no sooner does one [[man]], setting aside the [[law]], claim to subject
another to his private will, than he departs from the [[state]] of civil
society, and confronts him face to face in the pure [[state]] of [[nature]], in
which [[obedience]] is prescribed solely by necessity.

the most pressing interest of the ruler, and even his most
indispensable [[duty]], therefore, is to watch over the observation of the
laws of which he is the minister, and on which his whole [[authority]] is
founded. at the same [[time]], if he exacts the observance of them from
others, he is the more strongly bound to observe them himself, since he
enjoys all their favour. for his [[example]] is of such [[force]], that even if
the [[people]] were willing to permit him to release himself from the yoke
of the [[law]], he ought to be cautious in availing himself of so dangerous
a prerogative, which others might soon claim to usurp in their turn,
and often use to his prejudice. at bottom, as all social engagements
are mutual in [[nature]], it is impossible for any one to set himself above
the [[law]], without renouncing its advantages; for nobody is bound by any
obligation to one who claims that he is under no obligations to others.
for this [[reason]] no exemption from the [[law]] will ever be granted, on any
ground whatsoever, in a well-regulated [[government]]. those [[citizens]] who
have deserved well of their [[country]] ought to be rewarded with honours [[honour]],
but never with privileges [[privilege]]: for the [[republic]] is at the eve of its fall,
when any one can [[think]] it fine not to obey the laws [[law]]. if the nobility or
the soldiery should ever adopt such a [[maxim]], all would be lost beyond
redemption.

the [[power]] of the laws [[law]] depends still more on their own [[wisdom]] than on
the severity of their administrators, and the [[public]] will derives its
greatest weight from the [[reason]] which has dictated it. hence plato
looked upon it as a very necessary precaution to place at the head of
all edicts a preamble, setting forth their [[justice]] and utility. in
fact, the first of all laws [[law]] is to [[respect]] the laws [[law]]: the severity of
penalties is only a [[vain]] resource, [[invented]] by little minds [[mind]] in order
to substitute terror for that [[respect]] which they have no means of
obtaining. it has constantly been observed that in those countries
where legal punishments [[punishment]] are most severe, they are also most frequent;
so that the [[cruelty]] of such punishments [[punishment]] is a proof only of the
multitude of criminals [[criminal]], and, punishing everything with [[equal]] severity,
induces those who are guilty to commit crimes, in order to escape being
punished for their faults [[fault]].

but though the [[government]] be not master of the [[law]], it is much to be
its guarantor, and to possess a thousand means of inspiring the love
of it. in this alone the talent of reigning consists. with [[force]] in
one's hands, there is no art [[arts]] required to make the whole [[world]] tremble,
nor indeed much to gain men's hearts [[heart]]; for [[experience]] has long since
taught the [[people]] to give its rulers [[great]] credit for all the [[evil]] they
abstain from doing it, and to adore them if they do not absolutely hate
it. a [[fool]], if he be obeyed, may punish crimes as well as another: but
the true statesman is he who knows [[know]] how to prevent them: it is over the
wills, even more than the actions, of his subjects [[subject]] that his honourable
rule is extended. if he could secure that every one should act aright,
he would no longer have anything to do; and the masterpiece of his
labours would be to be able to remain unemployed. it is [[certain]], at
least, that the [[greatest]] talent a ruler can possess is to [[disguise]] his
power, in order to render it less odious, and to conduct the [[state]] so
peaceably as to make it seem to have no need of conductors.

i conclude, therefore, that, as the first [[duty]] of the legislator is to
make the laws [[law]] conformable to the general will, the first [[rule]] of public
_economy_ is that the administration of [[justice]] should be conformable
to the laws [[law]]. it will even be enough to prevent the [[state]] from being ill
governed, that the legislator shall have provided, as he should, for
every need of place, [[climate]], soil, custom, neighbourhood, and all the
rest of the relations peculiar to the [[people]] he had to institute. not
but what there still remains an infinity of details of administration
and economy, which are left to the [[wisdom]] of the [[government]]: but there
are two infallible rules [[rule]] for its [[good]] conduct on these occasions [[occasion]]; one
is, that the spirit of the [[law]] ought to decide in every particular
case that could not be foreseen; the other is that the general will,
the source and supplement of all laws [[law]], should be consulted wherever
they fail. but how, i shall be [[asked]], can the general will be known
in cases in which it has not expressed itself? must the whole nation
be assembled together at every unforeseen event? certainly not. it
ought the less to be assembled, because it is by no means [[certain]] that
its decision would be the expression of the general will; besides, the
method would be impracticable in a [[great]] [[people]], and is hardly ever
necessary where the [[government]] is well-intentioned: for the rulers
well [[know]] that the general will is always on the side which is most
favourable to the [[public]] interest, that is to say, most equitable; so
that it is needful only to act justly, to be [[certain]] of following the
general will. when this is flouted too openly, it makes itself [[felt]], in
spite of the formidable restraint of the [[public]] [[authority]]. i shall cite
the nearest possible examples [[example]] that may be followed in such cases.

in [[china]], it is the constant [[maxim]] of the [[prince]] to decide against his
officers, in every dispute that arises between them and the [[people]].
if bread be too dear in any province, the intendant of that province
is thrown into prison. if there be an insurrection in another, the
governor is dismissed, and every mandarin answers [[answer]] with his head for all
the mischief that happens in his department. not that these affairs do
not subsequently undergo a regular examination; but long experience
has caused the [[judgment]] to be thus anticipated. there is seldom any
injustice to be repaired; in the meantime, the [[emperor]], being satisfied
that [[public]] outcry does not arise without cause, always discovers,
through the seditious clamours which he punishes, just grievances to
redress.

it is a [[great]] thing to preserve the [[rule]] of [[peace]] and order through all
the parts of the [[republic]]; it is a [[great]] thing that the [[state]] should
be tranquil, and the [[law]] respected: but if nothing more is done, there
will be in all this more appearance than reality; for that government
which confines itself to mere [[obedience]] will find difficulty in getting
itself obeyed. if it is [[good]] to [[know]] how to deal with [[men]] as they are,
it is much [[better]] to make them what there is need that they should
be. the most absolute [[authority]] is that which penetrates into a man's
inmost being, and concerns itself no less with his will than with
his actions. it is [[certain]] that all peoples [[people]] become in the long run
what the [[government]] makes them; warriors, [[citizens]], [[men]], when it so
pleases; or merely populace and rabble, when it chooses to make them
so. hence every [[prince]] who despises his subjects [[subject]], dishonours himself,
in confessing that he does not [[know]] how to make them worthy of [[respect]].
make [[men]], therefore, if you would command [[men]]: if you would have them
obedient to the laws [[law]], make them [[love]] the laws [[law]], and then they will need
only to [[know]] what is their [[duty]] to do it. this was the [[great]] art [[arts]] of
ancient governments [[government]], in those distant times [[time]] when [[philosophers]] gave laws
to [[men]], and made use of their [[authority]] only to render them [[wise]] and
happy. thence arose the numerous sumptuary laws [[law]], the many regulations
of morals [[moral]], and all the [[public]] rules [[rule]] of conduct which were admitted
or rejected with the [[greatest]] [[care]]. even tyrants [[tyrant]] did not forget this
important part of administration, but took as [[great]] pains [[pain]] to corrupt
the morals [[moral]] of their slaves [[slave]], as magistrates took to [[correct]] those of
their fellow-citizens. but our [[modern]] governments [[government]], which imagine they
have done everything when they have raised [[money]], conceive that it is
unnecessary and even impossible to go a step further.

ii. the second essential [[rule]] of [[public]] economy is no less important
than the first. if you would have the general will accomplished, bring
all the particular wills into conformity with it; in other words, as
virtue is nothing more than this conformity of the particular wills
with the general will, establish the reign of [[virtue]].

if our politicians were less blinded by their [[ambition]], they would
see how impossible it is for any establishment whatever to act in
the spirit of its institution, unless it is guided in accordance
with the [[law]] of [[duty]]; they would [[feel]] that the [[greatest]] support of
public [[authority]] lies [[lie]] in the hearts [[heart]] of the [[citizens]], and that nothing
can take the place of morality in the maintenance of [[government]]. it
is not only upright [[men]] who [[know]] how to administer the laws [[law]]; but at
bottom only [[good]] [[men]] [[know]] how to obey them. the [[man]] who once gets the
better of remorse, will not shrink before punishments [[punishment]] which are less
severe, and less lasting, and from which there is at least the hope
of escaping: whatever precautions are taken, those who only require
impunity in order to do [[wrong]] will not fail to find means of eluding
the [[law]], and avoiding its penalties. in this case, as all particular
interests unite against the general interest, which is no longer that
of any [[individual]], [[public]] vices [[vice]] have a greater effect in enervating
the laws [[law]] than the laws [[law]] in the repression of such vices [[vice]]: so that the
corruption of the [[people]] and of their rulers will at length extend to
the [[government]], however [[wise]] it may be. the worst of all abuses [[abuse]] is
to [[pay]] an apparent [[obedience]] to the laws [[law]], only in order actually to
break them with security. for in this case the [[best]] laws [[law]] soon become
the most pernicious; and it would be a hundred times [[time]] [[better]] that
they should not [[exist]]. in such a situation, it is [[vain]] to add edicts
to edicts and regulations to regulations. everything serves only to
introduce new abuses [[abuse]], without correcting the old. the more laws [[law]] are
multiplied, the more they are despised, and all the new officials
appointed to supervise them are only so many more [[people]] to break
them, and either to share the plunder with their predecessors, or to
plunder apart on their own. the [[reward]] of [[virtue]] soon becomes that of
robbery; the vilest of [[men]] rise to the [[greatest]] credit; the greater
they are the more despicable they become; their infamy appears even in
their dignities, and their very honours [[honour]] dishonour them. if they buy
the influence of the leaders or the protection of [[women]], it is only
that they may sell [[justice]], [[duty]], and the [[state]] in their turn: in the
meantime, the [[people]], feeling that its vices [[vice]] are not the first cause of
its misfortunes, murmurs and complains that all its misfortunes come
solely from those whom it pays [[pay]] to [[protect]] it from such things.

it is under these circumstances that the voice of [[duty]] no longer speaks
in men's hearts [[heart]], and their rulers are obliged to substitute the cry of
terror, or the lure of an apparent interest, of which they subsequently
trick their creatures. in this situation they are compelled to have
recourse to all the petty and despicable shifts which they call _rules
of state_ and _mysteries of the cabinet_. all the vigour that is left
in the [[government]] is used by its members in ruining and supplanting one
another, while the [[public]] [[business]] is neglected, or is transacted only
as personal interest requires and directs. in short, the whole art [[arts]] of
those [[great]] politicians lies [[lie]] in so mesmerising those they stand in need
of, that each may [[think]] he is labouring for his own interest in working
for theirs: i say _theirs_ on the false supposition that it is the real
interest of rulers to annihilate a [[people]] in order to make it [[subject]],
and to; ruin their own [[property]] in order to secure their possession of
it.

but when the [[citizens]] [[love]] their [[duty]], and the guardians of the public
authority sincerely apply themselves to the fostering of that love
by their own [[example]] and assiduity, every difficulty vanishes; and
government becomes so easy that it needs none of that art [[arts]] of darkness,
whose blackness is its only mystery. those enterprising spirits,
so dangerous and so much admired, all those [[great]] ministers, whose
glory is inseparable from the miseries of the [[people]], are no longer
regretted: [[public]] morality supplies what is wanting in the genius of
the rulers; and the more [[virtue]] reigns, the less need there is for
talent. even [[ambition]] is [[better]] served by [[duty]] than by usurpation:
when the [[people]] is convinced that its rulers are labouring only for
its [[happiness]], its deference saves them the trouble of labouring to
strengthen their [[power]]: and [[history]] shows us, in a thousand cases,
that the [[authority]] of one who is beloved over those whom he loves [[love]] is
a hundred times [[time]] more absolute than all the [[tyranny]] of usurpers. this
does not mean that the [[government]] ought to be afraid to make use of its
power, but that it ought to make use of it only in a lawful manner.
we find in [[history]] a thousand examples [[example]] of pusillanimous or ambitious
rulers, who were ruined by their slackness or their [[pride]]; not one who
suffered for having been strictly just. but we ought not to confound
negligence with moderation, or clemency with weakness. to be just, it
is necessary to be severe; to permit [[vice]], when one has the [[right]] and
the [[power]] to suppress it, is to be oneself vicious.

it is not enough to say to the [[citizens]], _be good_; they must be
taught to be so; and even [[example]], which is in this [[respect]] the first
lesson, is not the sole means to be employed; [[patriotism]] is the most
efficacious: for, as i have said already, every [[man]] is [[virtuous]] when
his particular will is in all things conformable to the general will,
and we voluntarily will what is willed by those whom we [[love]]. it
appears that the feeling of [[humanity]] evaporates and grows feeble in
embracing all [[mankind]], and that we cannot be affected by the calamities
of tartary or japan, in the same manner as we are by those of european
nations. it is necessary in some [[degree]] to confine and limit our
interest and compassion in order to make it active. now, as this
sentiment can be useful only to those with whom we have to [[live]], it is
proper that our [[humanity]] should confine itself to our fellow-citizens,
and should receive a new [[force]] because we are in the habit of seeing
them, and by [[reason]] of the [[common]] interest which unites them. it is
certain that the [[greatest]] [[miracles]] of [[virtue]] have been produced by
patriotism: this fine and lively feeling, which gives to the [[force]] of
self-love all the [[beauty]] of [[virtue]], lends it an energy which, without
disfiguring it, makes it the most heroic of all [[passions]]. this it is
that produces [[produce]] so many [[immortal]] actions, the [[glory]] of which dazzles our
feeble [[eyes]]; and so many [[great]] [[men]], whose old-world virtues [[virtue]] pass for
fables now that [[patriotism]] is made mock of. this is not surprising;
the transports of susceptible hearts [[heart]] appear altogether fanciful to any
one who has never [[felt]] them; and the [[love]] of one's [[country]], which is a
hundred times [[time]] more lively and delightful than the [[love]] of a mistress,
cannot be conceived except by experiencing it. but it is easy to
perceive in every [[heart]] that is warmed by it, in all the actions it
inspires, a glowing and sublime ardour which does not attend the purest
virtue, when separated from it. contrast [[socrates]] even with cato; the
one was the greater philosopher, the other more of the citizen. athens
was already ruined in the [[time]] of [[socrates]], and he had no other country
than the [[world]] at large. cato had the cause of his [[country]] always at
heart; he lived for it alone, and could not bear to outlive it. the
virtue of [[socrates]] was that of the wisest of [[men]]; but, compared with
cæsar and pompey, cato seems a [[god]] among mortals. [[socrates]] instructed
a few individuals [[individual]], opposed the sophists, and died for [[truth]]: but cato
defended his [[country]], its [[liberty]] and its laws [[law]], against the conquerors
of the [[world]], and at length departed from the [[earth]], when he had no
longer a [[country]] to serve. a worthy pupil of [[socrates]] would be the most
virtuous of his contemporaries; but a worthy follower of cato would be
one of the [[greatest]]. the [[virtue]] of the former would be his [[happiness]];
the latter would seek his [[happiness]] in that of all. we should be taught
by the one, and [[led]] by the other; and this alone is enough to determine
which to prefer: for no [[people]] has ever been made into a nation of
philosophers, but it is not impossible to make a [[people]] [[happy]].

do we [[wish]] [[men]] to be [[virtuous]]? then let us begin by making them love
their [[country]]: but how can they [[love]] it, if their [[country]] be nothing
more to them than to strangers, and afford them nothing but what it
can refuse nobody? it would be still worse, if they did not enjoy even
the [[privilege]] of social security, and if their lives [[life]], liberties [[liberty]] and
property lay at the [[mercy]] of persons [[person]] in [[power]], without their being
permitted, or it being possible for them, to get relief from the laws [[law]].
for in that case, being subjected to the duties [[duty]] of the [[state]] of civil
society, without enjoying even the [[common]] privileges [[privilege]] of the [[state]] of
nature, and without being able to use their [[strength]] in their own
defence, they would be in the worst, condition in which freemen could
possibly find themselves, and the word _country_ would mean for them
something merely odious and ridiculous. it must not be imagined that a
man can break or lose an arm, without the [[pain]] being conveyed to his
head: nor is it any more credible that the general will should consent
that any one member of the [[state]], whoever he might be, should wound or
destroy another, than it is that the fingers of a [[man]] in his senses
should wilfully scratch his [[eyes]] out. the security of individuals [[individual]] is so
intimately connected with the [[public]] confederation that, apart from the
regard that must be paid to [[human]] weakness, that convention would in
point of [[right]] be dissolved, if in the [[state]] a [[single]] citizen who might
have been relieved were allowed to perish, or if one were wrongfully
confined in prison, or if in one case an obviously [[unjust]] sentence were
given. for the fundamental conventions being broken, it is impossible
to conceive of any [[right]] or interest that could retain the [[people]] in
the social union; unless they were restrained by [[force]], which alone
causes the dissolution of the [[state]] of civil [[society]].

in [[fact]], does not the undertaking entered into by the whole [[body]] of the
nation bind it to provide for the security of the least of its members
with as much [[care]] as for that of all the rest? is the welfare of a
single citizen any less the [[common]] cause than that of the whole [[state]]?
it may be said that it is [[good]] that one should perish for all. i am
ready to [[admire]] such a saying when it comes from the lips of a virtuous
and worthy patriot, voluntarily and dutifully sacrificing himself for
the [[good]] of his [[country]]: but if we are to [[understand]] by it, that it
is lawful for the [[government]] to [[sacrifice]] an [[innocent]] [[man]] for the good
of the multitude, i look upon it as one of the most execrable rules
tyranny ever [[invented]], the [[greatest]] falsehood that can be advanced, the
most dangerous admission that can be made, and a direct contradiction
of the fundamental laws [[law]] of [[society]]. so little is it the case that any
one [[person]] ought to perish for all, that all have pledged their lives
and properties [[property]] for the defence of each, in order that the weakness of
individuals may always be protected by the [[strength]] of the [[public]], and
each member by the whole [[state]]. suppose we take from the whole people
one [[individual]] after another, and then press the advocates of this rule
to explain more exactly what they mean by the _body of the state_, and
we shall see that it will at length be reduced to a small number of
persons, who are not the [[people]], but the officers of the [[people]], and
who, having bound themselves by personal oath to perish for the welfare
of the [[people]], would thence infer that the [[people]] is to perish for
their own.

need we look for examples [[example]] of the protection which the [[state]] owes to its
members, and the [[respect]] it owes to their persons [[person]]? it is only among
the most illustrious and courageous nations that they are to be found;
it is only among [[free]] peoples [[people]] that the [[dignity]] of [[man]] is realised. it
is well known into what perplexity the whole [[republic]] of sparta was
thrown, when the [[question]] of punishing a guilty citizen arose.

in macedon, the [[life]] of a [[man]] was a matter of such importance, that
alexander the [[great]], at the height of his [[glory]], would not have dared
to put a macedonian [[criminal]] to [[death]] in cold [[blood]], till the accused
had appeared to make his defence before his fellow-citizens, and had
been condemned by them. but the romans distinguished themselves above
all other peoples [[people]] by the regard which their [[government]] paid to the
individual, and by its scrupulous attention to the preservation of
the inviolable rights [[right]] of all the members of the [[state]]. nothing was
so [[sacred]] among them as the [[life]] of a citizen; and no less than an
assembly of the whole [[people]] was needed to condemn one. not even the
senate, nor the consuls, in all their majesty, possessed the [[right]];
but the crime and [[punishment]] of a citizen were regarded as a public
calamity among the most powerful [[people]] in the [[world]]. so hard indeed
did it seem to shed [[blood]] for any crime whatsoever, that by the lex
porcia, the penalty of [[death]] was commuted into that of [[banishment]] for
all those who were willing to survive the loss of so [[great]] a [[country]].
everything both at [[rome]], and in the roman armies [[army]], breathed that [[love]] of
fellow-citizens one for another, and that [[respect]] for the roman name,
which raised the [[courage]] and inspired the [[virtue]] of every one who had
the [[honour]] to bear it. the cap of a citizen delivered from [[slavery]],
the civic [[crown]] of him who had saved the [[life]] of another, were looked
upon with the [[greatest]] [[pleasure]] amid the pomp of their triumphs; and
it is remarkable that among the crowns [[crown]] which were bestowed in honour
of splendid actions in [[war]], the civic [[crown]] and that of the triumphant
general alone were of laurel, all the others being merely of gold. it
was thus that [[rome]] was [[virtuous]] and became the mistress of the [[world]].
ambitious rulers! a herdsman governs his dogs and cattle, and yet is
only the meanest of [[mankind]]. if it be a fine thing to command, it is
when those who obey us are capable of doing us [[honour]]. show [[respect]],
therefore, to your fellow-citizens, and you will render yourselves
worthy of [[respect]]; show [[respect]] to [[liberty]], and your [[power]] will
increase daily. never exceed your rights [[right]], and they will soon become
unlimited.

let our [[country]] then show itself the [[common]] [[mother]] of her [[citizens]]; let
the advantages they enjoy in their [[country]] endear it to them; let the
government leave them enough share in the [[public]] administration to make
them [[feel]] that they are at [[home]]; and let the laws [[law]] be in their [[eyes]] only
the guarantees of the [[common]] [[liberty]]. these rights [[right]], [[great]] as they are,
belong to all [[men]]: but without seeming to attack them directly, the
ill-will of rulers may in [[fact]] easily reduce their effect to nothing.
the [[law]], which they thus [[abuse]], serves the powerful at once as a weapon
of offence, and as a shield against the [[weak]]; and the pretext of the
public [[good]] is always the most dangerous scourge of the [[people]]. what
is most necessary, and perhaps most difficult, in [[government]], is rigid
integrity in doing strict [[justice]] to all, and above all in protecting
the [[poor]] against the [[tyranny]] of the [[rich]]. the [[greatest]] [[evil]] has
already come about, when there are [[poor]] [[men]] to be defended, and rich
men to be restrained. it is on the middle classes alone that the whole
force of the [[law]] is exerted; they are equally powerless against the
treasures of the [[rich]] and the penury of the [[poor]]. the first mocks them,
the second escapes them. the one breaks the meshes, the other passes
through them.

it is therefore one of the most important functions of [[government]] to
prevent extreme inequality of fortunes [[fortune]]; not by taking away [[wealth]] from
its possessors, but by depriving all [[men]] of means to accumulate it;
not by building hospitals for the [[poor]], but by securing the citizens
from becoming [[poor]]. the unequal distribution of inhabitants over the
territory, when [[men]] are crowded together in one place, while other
places are depopulated; the encouragement of the [[arts]] that minister
to luxury and of purely industrial [[arts]] at the expense of useful
and laborious crafts; the [[sacrifice]] of agriculture to commerce; the
necessitation of the tax-farmer by the mal-administration of the funds
of the [[state]]; and in short, venality pushed to such an extreme that
even [[public]] esteem is reckoned at a cash value, and [[virtue]] rated at
a market price: these are the most obvious causes of opulence and
of [[poverty]], of [[public]] interest, of mutual [[hatred]] among [[citizens]], of
indifference to the [[common]] cause, of the [[corruption]] of the [[people]], and
of the weakening of all the springs of [[government]]. such are the evils [[evil]],
which are with difficulty cured when they make themselves [[felt]], but
which a [[wise]] administration ought to prevent, if it is to maintain,
along with [[good]] morals [[moral]], [[respect]] for the laws [[law]], [[patriotism]], and the
influence of the general will.

but all these precautions will be inadequate, unless rulers go still
more to the root of the matter. i conclude this part of [[public]] economy
where i ought to have begun it. there can be no [[patriotism]] without
liberty, no [[liberty]] without [[virtue]], no [[virtue]] without [[citizens]]; create
citizens, and you have everything you need; without them, you will have
nothing but debased slaves [[slave]], from the rulers of the [[state]] downwards. to
form [[citizens]] is not the [[work]] of a day; and in order to have [[men]] it
is necessary to educate them when they are [[children]]. it will be said,
perhaps, that whoever has [[men]] to govern, ought not to seek, beyond
their [[nature]], a [[perfection]] of which they are incapable; that he ought
not to [[desire]] to [[destroy]] their [[passions]]; and that the execution of such
an attempt is no more desirable than it is possible. i will agree,
further, that a [[man]] without [[passions]] would certainly be a [[bad]] citizen;
but it must be agreed also that, if [[men]] are not taught not to love
some things, it is impossible to [[teach]] them to [[love]] one object more
than another--to prefer that which is truly beautiful to that which is
deformed. if, for [[example]], they were early accustomed to regard their
individuality only in its relation to the [[body]] of the [[state]], and to be
aware, so to speak, of their own existence merely as a part of that of
the [[state]], they might at length come to identify themselves in some
degree with this greater whole, to [[feel]] themselves members of their
country, and to [[love]] it with that exquisite feeling which no isolated
person has save for himself; to lift up their spirits perpetually to
this [[great]] object, and thus to transform into a sublime [[virtue]] that
dangerous disposition which gives rise to all our vices [[vice]]. not only does
philosophy demonstrate the possibility of giving feeling these new
directions; [[history]] furnishes us with a thousand striking examples [[example]].
if they are so rare among us moderns, it is because nobody troubles
himself whether [[citizens]] [[exist]] or not, and still less does anybody
think of attending to the matter soon enough to make them. it is too
late to [[change]] our [[natural]] inclinations, when they have taken their
course, and egoism is confirmed by habit: it is too late to lead us
out of ourselves when once the [[human]] ego, concentrated in our hearts [[heart]],
has acquired that contemptible activity which absorbs all [[virtue]] and
constitutes the [[life]] and being of little minds [[mind]]. how can, patriotism
germinate in the midst of so many other [[passions]] which smother it?
and what can remain, for fellow-citizens, of a [[heart]] already divided
between avarice, a mistress, and vanity?

from the first moment of [[life]], [[men]] ought to begin learning to deserve
to [[live]]; and, as at the instant of birth we partake of the rights [[right]] of
citizenship, that instant ought to be the beginning of the exercise of
our [[duty]]. if there are laws [[law]] for the [[age]] of maturity, there ought to be
laws for infancy, teaching [[obedience]] to others: and as the [[reason]] of
each [[man]] is not left to be the sole arbiter of his duties [[duty]], government
ought the less indiscriminately to abandon to the [[intelligence]] and
prejudices of fathers [[father]] the [[education]] of their [[children]], as that
education is of still greater importance to the [[state]] than to the
fathers: for, according to the course of [[nature]], the [[death]] of the
father often deprives him of the final fruits of [[education]]; but his
country sooner or later perceives its effects. families [[family]] dissolve, but
the [[state]] remains.

should the [[public]] [[authority]], by taking the place of the [[father]], and
charging itself with that important function, acquire his rights [[right]] by
discharging his duties [[duty]], he would have the less cause to [[complain]], as
he would only be changing his title, and would have in [[common]], under
the name of _citizen_, the same [[authority]] over his [[children]], as he was
exercising separately under the name of _father_, and would not be less
obeyed when speaking in the name of the [[law]], than when he spoke in that
of [[nature]]. [[public]] [[education]], therefore, under regulations prescribed
by the [[government]], and under magistrates established by the [[sovereign]],
is one of the fundamental rules [[rule]] of popular or legitimate [[government]].
if [[children]] are brought up in [[common]] in the bosom of equality; if they
are imbued with the laws [[law]] of the [[state]] and the precepts of the general
will; if they are taught to [[respect]] these above all things; if they
are surrounded by examples [[example]] and objects which constantly remind them of
the tender [[mother]] who nourishes them, of the [[love]] she bears them, of
the inestimable benefits they receive from her, and of the return they
owe her, we cannot [[doubt]] that they will learn to cherish one another
mutually as brothers [[brother]], to will nothing contrary to the will of [[society]],
to substitute the actions of [[men]] and [[citizens]] for the futile and vain
babbling of sophists, and to become in [[time]] defenders and fathers [[father]] of
the [[country]] of which they will have been so long the [[children]].

i shall say nothing of the magistrates destined to preside over such
an [[education]], which is certainly the most important [[business]] of the
state. it is easy to see that if such marks of [[public]] confidence
were conferred on slight grounds, if this sublime function were not,
for those who have worthily discharged all other offices, the reward
of [[labour]], the pleasant and honourable repose of old [[age]], and the
crown of all honours [[honour]], the whole enterprise would be useless and the
education void of [[success]]. for where-ever the lesson is not supported
by [[authority]], and the precept by [[example]], all instruction is fruitless;
and [[virtue]] itself loses its credit in the mouth of one who does not
practise it. but let illustrious warriors, bent under the weight of
their laurels, preach [[courage]]: let upright magistrates, grown white
in the purple and on the bench [[teach]] [[justice]]. such teachers as these
would thus get themselves [[virtuous]] successors, and transmit from [[age]] to
age, to generations [[generation]] to come, the [[experience]] and [[talents]] of rulers, the
courage and [[virtue]] of [[citizens]], and [[common]] emulation in all to [[live]] and
die for their [[country]].

i [[know]] of but three peoples [[people]] which once practised [[public]] [[education]], the
cretans, the lacedæmonians, and the ancient persians: among all these
it was attended with the [[greatest]] [[success]], and indeed it did wonders
among the two [[last]]. since the [[world]] has been divided into nations too
great to admit of being well governed, this method has been no longer
practicable, and the reader will readily perceive other reasons [[reason]] why
such a thing has never been attempted by any [[modern]] [[people]]. it is very
remarkable that the romans were able to dispense with it; but [[rome]] was
for five hundred years one continued miracle which the [[world]] cannot
hope to see again. the [[virtue]] of the romans, engendered by their horror
of [[tyranny]] and the crimes of tyrants [[tyrant]], and by an innate [[patriotism]], made
all their houses so many schools of citizenship; while the unlimited
power of fathers [[father]] over their [[children]] made the [[individual]] [[authority]] so
rigid that the [[father]] was more feared than the magistrate, and was in
his [[family]] tribunal both censor of morals [[moral]] and avenger of the laws [[law]].

thus a careful and well-intentioned [[government]], vigilant incessantly to
maintain or restore [[patriotism]] and morality among the [[people]], provides
beforehand against the evils [[evil]] which sooner or later result from the
indifference of the [[citizens]] to the [[fate]] of the [[republic]], keeping
within narrow bounds that personal interest which so isolates the
individual that the [[state]] is enfeebled by his [[power]], and has nothing
to [[hope]] from his good-will. wherever [[men]] [[love]] their [[country]], respect
the laws [[law]], and [[live]] simply, little remains to be done in order to make
them [[happy]]; and in [[public]] administration, where [[chance]] has less
influence than in the lot of individuals [[individual]], [[wisdom]] is so nearly allied to
happiness, that the two objects are confounded.

iii. it is not enough to have [[citizens]] and to [[protect]] them, it is also
necessary to consider their subsistence. provision for the [[public]] wants
is an obvious inference from the general will, and the third essential
duty of [[government]]. this [[duty]] is not, we should [[feel]], to fill the
granaries of individuals [[individual]] and thereby to grant them a dispensation from
labour, but to keep plenty so within their reach that [[labour]] is always
necessary and never useless for its acquisition. it extends also to
everything regarding the management of the exchequer, and the expenses
of [[public]] administration. having thus treated of general economy with
reference to the [[government]] of persons [[person]], we must now consider it with
reference to the administration of [[property]].

this part presents [[present]] no fewer difficulties to solve, and contradictions
to remove, than the preceding. it is [[certain]] that the [[right]] of property
is the most [[sacred]] of all the rights [[right]] of citizenship, and even more
important in some respects [[respect]] than [[liberty]] itself; either because it more
nearly affects the preservation of [[life]], or because, [[property]] being
more easily usurped and more difficult to defend than [[life]], the law
ought to [[pay]] a greater attention to what is most easily taken away; or
finally, because [[property]] is the true foundation of civil [[society]], and
the real guarantee of the undertakings of [[citizens]]: for if property
were not answerable for personal actions, nothing would be easier
than to evade duties [[duty]] and laugh at the laws [[law]]. on the other hand, it is
no less [[certain]] that the maintenance of the [[state]] and the government
involves costs and out-goings; and as every one who agrees to the end
must acquiesce in the means, it follows that the members of a society
ought to contribute from their [[property]] to its support. besides, it is
difficult to secure the [[property]] of individuals [[individual]] on one side, without
attacking it on another; and it is impossible that all the regulations
which govern the order of succession, will, contracts, &c. should not
lay individuals [[individual]] under some constraint as to the disposition of their
goods, and should not consequently restrict the [[right]] of [[property]].

but besides what i have said above of the agreement between the
authority of [[law]] and the [[liberty]] of the citizen, there remains to
be made, with [[respect]] to the disposition of goods [[good]], an important
observation which removes many difficulties. as puffendorf has shown,
the [[right]] of [[property]], by its very [[nature]], does not extend beyond the
life of the proprietor, and the moment a [[man]] is [[dead]] his goods [[good]] cease
to belong to him. thus, to prescribe the conditions according to which
he can dispose of them, is in reality less to alter his [[right]] as it
appears, than to extend it in [[fact]].

in general, although the institution of the laws [[law]] which regulate the
power of individuals [[individual]] in the disposition of their own goods [[good]] belongs only
to the [[sovereign]], the spirit of these laws [[law]], which the [[government]] ought
to [[follow]] in their application, is that, from [[father]] to [[son]], and from
relation to relation, the goods [[good]] of a [[family]] should go as little out of
it and be as little alienated as possible. there is a sensible reason
for this in favour of [[children]], to whom the [[right]] of [[property]] would be
quite useless, if the [[father]] left them nothing, and who besides, having
often contributed by their [[labour]] to the acquisition of their father's
wealth, are in their own [[right]] associates with him in his [[right]] of
property. but another [[reason]], more distant, though not less important,
is that nothing is more fatal to morality and to the [[republic]] than the
continual shifting of rank and [[fortune]] among the [[citizens]]: such changes
are both the proof and the source of a thousand disorders, and overturn
and confound everything; for those who were brought up to one thing
find themselves destined for another; and neither those who rise nor
those who fall are able to assume the rules [[rule]] of conduct, or to possess
themselves of the qualifications requisite for their new condition,
still less to discharge the duties [[duty]] it entails. i proceed to the object
of [[public]] finance.

if the [[people]] governed itself and there were no intermediary between
the administration of the [[state]] and the [[citizens]], they would have no
more to do than to assess themselves occasionally, in proportion to
the [[public]] needs and the abilities of individuals [[individual]]: and as they would
all keep in sight the recovery and employment of such assessments, no
fraud or [[abuse]] could slip into the management of them; the [[state]] would
never be involved in debt, or the [[people]] over-burdened with taxes;
or at least the [[knowledge]] of how the [[money]] would be used would be a
consolation for the severity of the tax. but things cannot be carried
an in this manner: on the contrary, however small any [[state]] may be,
civil societies [[society]] are always too populous to be under the immediate
government of all their members. it is necessary that the [[public]] money
should go through the hands of the rulers, all of whom have, besides
the interests of the [[state]], their own [[individual]] interests, which are
not the [[last]] to be listened to. the [[people]], on its side, perceiving
rather the cupidity and ridiculous expenditure of its rulers than the
public needs, murmurs at seeing itself stripped of necessaries to
furnish others with superfluities; and when once these complaints have
reached a [[certain]] [[degree]] of bitterness, the most upright administration
will find it impossible to restore confidence. in such a case,
voluntary contributions bring in nothing, and forced contributions
are illegitimate. this cruel alternative of letting the [[state]] perish,
or of violating the [[sacred]] [[right]] of [[property]], which is its support,
constitutes the [[great]] difficulty of just and prudent economy.

the first step which the founder of a [[republic]] ought to take after
the establishment of laws [[law]], is to settle a sufficient fund for the
maintenance of the magistrates and other officials, and for other
public expenses. this fund, if it consist of [[money]], is called
_œrarium_ or _fisc_, and _public demesne_ if it consist of lands [[land]].
this, for obvious reasons [[reason]], is much to be preferred. whoever has
reflected on this matter must be of the [[opinion]] of bodin, who looks
upon the [[public]] demesne as the most reputable and [[certain]] means of
providing for the needs of the [[state]]. it is remarkable also that
romulus, in his division of lands [[land]], made it his first [[care]] to set apart
a third for the use of the [[state]]. i confess it is not impossible for
the [[produce]] of the demesne, if it be badly managed, to be reduced to
nothing; but it is not of the essence of [[public]] demesnes to be badly
administered.

before any use is made of this fund, it should be assigned or accepted
by an assembly of the [[people]], or of the estates of the [[country]], which
should determine its future use. after this solemnity, which makes such
funds inalienable, their very [[nature]] is, in a manner, changed, and
the revenues [[revenue]] become so [[sacred]], that it is not only the most infamous
theft, but actual [[treason]], to misapply them or pervert them from the
purpose for which they were destined. it reflects [[great]] dishonour
on [[rome]] that the integrity of cato the censor was something so very
remarkable, and that an [[emperor]], on rewarding the [[talents]] of a singer
with a few crowns [[crown]], [[thought]] it necessary to observe that the [[money]] came
from his own private purse, and not from that of the [[state]]. but if we
find few galbas, where are we to look for a cato? for when [[vice]] is no
longer dishonourable, what chiefs [[chief]] will be so scrupulous as to abstain
from touching the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]] that are left to their discretion,
and even not in [[time]] to impose on themselves, by pretending to confound
their own expensive and scandalous dissipations with the [[glory]] of the
state, and the means of extending their own [[authority]] with the means
of augmenting its [[power]]? it is particularly in this delicate part of
the administration that [[virtue]] is the only effective instrument, and
that the integrity of the magistrate is the only real check upon his
avarice. books [[book]] and auditing of accounts, instead of exposing frauds,
only conceal them; for prudence is never so ready to conceive new
precautions as knavery is to elude them. never [[mind]], then, about
account books [[book]] and papers; place the management of finance in honest
hands: that is the only way to get it faithfully conducted.

when [[public]] funds are once established, the rulers of the state
become of [[right]] the administrators of them: for this administration
constitutes a part of [[government]] which is always essential, though
not always equally so. its influence increases in proportion as that
of other resources is diminished; and it may justly be said that a
government has reached the [[last]] stage of [[corruption]], when it has ceased
to have sinews other than [[money]]. now as every [[government]] constantly
tends to become lax, this is enough to show why no [[state]] can subsist
unless its revenues [[revenue]] constantly increase.

the first sense of the necessity of this increase is also the
first sign of the internal disorder of the [[state]]; and the prudent
administrator, in his endeavours to find means to provide for the
present necessity, will neglect nothing to find out the distant cause
of the new need; just as a mariner when he finds the water gaining
on his vessel, does not neglect, while he is working the pumps, to
discover and stop the leak.

from this [[rule]] is deduced the most important [[rule]] in the administration
of finance, which is, to take more pains [[pain]] to guard against needs than
to increase revenues [[revenue]]. for, whatever diligence be employed, the relief
which only comes after, and more slowly than, the [[evil]], always leaves
some injury behind. while a remedy is being found for one [[evil]], another
is beginning to make itself [[felt]], and even the remedies themselves
produce new difficulties: so that at length the nation is involved in
debt and the [[people]] [[oppressed]], while the [[government]] loses its influence
and can do very little with a [[great]] deal of [[money]]. i imagine it was
owing to the recognition of this [[rule]] that such wonders were done by
ancient governments [[government]], which did more with their parsimony than ours do
with all their treasures; and perhaps from this comes the [[common]] use of
the word _economy_, which means rather the prudent management of what
one has than ways of getting what one has not.

but apart from the [[public]] demesne, which is of service to the [[state]] in
proportion to the uprightness of those who govern, any one sufficiently
acquainted with the whole [[force]] of the general administration,
especially when it confines itself to legitimate methods, would be
astonished at the resources the rulers can make use of for guarding
against [[public]] needs, without trespassing on the goods [[good]] of individuals [[individual]].
as they are masters of the whole commerce of the [[state]], nothing is
easier for them than to direct it into such channels as to provide
for every need, without appearing to interfere. the distribution of
provisions, [[money]], and merchandise in just proportions, according to
times and places, is the true secret of finance and the source of
wealth, provided those who administer it have foresight enough to
suffer a [[present]] apparent loss, in order really to obtain immense
profits in the future. when we see a [[government]] paying bounties,
instead of receiving duties [[duty]], on the exportation of corn in [[time]] of
plenty, and on its importation in [[time]] of scarcity, we must have such
facts before our [[eyes]] if we are to be persuaded of their reality.
we should hold such facts [[fact]] to be idle tales, if they had happened in
ancient times [[time]]. let us suppose that, in order to prevent a scarcity in
bad years, a proposal were made to establish [[public]] granaries; would
not the maintenance of so useful an institution serve in most countries
as an excuse for new taxes? at geneva, such granaries, established
and kept up by a prudent administration, are a [[public]] resource in bad
years, and the principal [[revenue]] of the [[state]] at all times [[time]]. _alit et
ditat_ is the inscription which stands, rightly and properly, on the
front of the building. to set forth in this place the economic system
of a [[good]] [[government]], i have often turned my [[eyes]] to that of this
republic, rejoicing to find in my own [[country]] an [[example]] of that wisdom
and [[happiness]] which i should be glad to see prevail in every other.

if we ask how the needs of a [[state]] grow, we shall find they generally
arise, like the wants of individuals [[individual]], less from any real necessity
than from the increase of useless desires [[desire]], and that expenses are often
augmented only to give a pretext for raising receipts: so that the
state would sometimes gain by not being [[rich]], and apparent [[wealth]] is in
reality more burdensome than [[poverty]] itself would be. rulers may indeed
hope to keep the peoples [[people]] in stricter dependence, by thus giving them
with one hand what they take from them with the other; and this was in
fact the policy of joseph towards the [[egyptians]]: but this political
sophistry is the more fatal to the [[state]], as the [[money]] never returns
into the hands it went out of. such principles [[principle]] only enrich the idle at
the expense of the industrious.

a [[desire]] for [[conquest]] is one of the most evident and dangerous causes
of this increase. this [[desire]], occasioned often by a different species
of [[ambition]] from that which, it seems to proclaim, is not always
what it appears to be, and has not so much, for its real motive, the
apparent [[desire]] to aggrandise the nation as a secret [[desire]] to increase
the [[authority]] of the rulers at [[home]], by increasing the number of
troops, and by the diversion which the objects of [[war]] [[occasion]] in the
minds of the [[citizens]].

it is at least [[certain]], that no peoples [[people]] are so [[oppressed]] and wretched
as conquering nations, and that their successes only increase their
misery. did not [[history]] inform us of the [[fact]], [[reason]] would suffice
to tell us that, the greater a [[state]] grows, the heavier and more
burdensome in proportion its expenses become: for every province has
to furnish its share to the general expense of [[government]], and besides
has to be at the expense of its own administration, which is as great
as if it were really independent. add to this that [[great]] fortunes [[fortune]] are
always acquired in one place and spent in another. production therefore
soon ceases to balance consumption, and a whole [[country]] is impoverished
merely to enrich a [[single]] town.

another source of the increase of [[public]] wants, which depends on the
foregoing, is this. there may come a [[time]] when the [[citizens]], no longer
looking upon themselves as interested in the [[common]] cause, will cease
to be the defenders of their [[country]], and the magistrates will prefer
the command of mercenaries to that of free-men; if for no other reason
than that, when the [[time]] comes, they may use them to reduce free-men to
submission. such was the [[state]] of [[rome]] towards the end of the republic
and under the emperors [[emperor]]: for all the victories [[victory]] of the early romans,
like those of alexander, had been won by brave [[citizens]], who were
ready, at need, to give their [[blood]] in the service of their [[country]],
but would never sell it. only at the siege of veii did the practice
of paying the roman infantry begin. marius, in the jugurthine [[war]],
dishonoured the legions by introducing freedmen, vagabonds and other
mercenaries. tyrants [[tyrant]], the enemies [[enemy]] of the very [[people]] it was their duty
to make [[happy]], maintained regular [[troops]], apparently to withstand
the foreigner, but really to enslave their countrymen. to form such
troops, it was necessary to take [[men]] from the [[land]]; the lack of their
labour then diminished the amount of provisions, and their maintenance
introduced those taxes which increased prices. this first disorder
gave rise to murmurs among the [[people]]; in order to suppress them, the
number of [[troops]] had to be increased, and consequently the misery
of the [[people]] also got worse; and the growing despair [[led]] to still
further increases in the cause in order to guard against its effects.
on the other hand, the mercenaries, whose [[merit]] we may [[judge]] of by the
price at which they sold themselves, proud of their own meanness, and
despising the laws [[law]] that protected them, as well as their fellows whose
bread they ate, imagined themselves more honoured in being cæsar's
satellites than in being defenders of [[rome]]. as they were given over
to blind [[obedience]], their swords [[sword]] were always at the throats of their
fellow-citizens, and they were prepared for general butchery at the
first sign. it would not be difficult to show that this was one of the
principal causes of the ruin of the roman [[empire]].

the invention of artillery and fortifications has forced the princes
of [[europe]], in [[modern]] times [[time]], to return to the use of regular [[troops]], in
order to garrison their towns; but> however lawful their motives, it is
to be feared the effect may be no less fatal. there is no [[better]] reason
now than formerly for depopulating the [[country]] to form armies [[army]] and
garrisons, nor should the [[people]] be [[oppressed]] to support, them; in a
word, these dangerous establishments have increased of late years with
such rapidity in this part of the [[world]], that they evidently threaten
to depopulate [[europe]], and sooner or later to ruin its inhabitants.

be this as it may, it ought to be seen that such institutions
necessarily subvert the true economic [[system]], which draws the principal
revenue of the [[state]] from the [[public]] demesne, and leave only the
troublesome resource of subsidies and imposts; with which it remains to
deal.

it should be remembered that the foundation of the social compact is
property; and its first condition, that every one should be maintained
in the peaceful possession of what belongs to him. it is true that,
by the same treaty, every one binds himself, at least tacitly, to
be assessed toward the [[public]] wants: but as this undertaking cannot
prejudice the fundamental [[law]], and presupposes that the need is
clearly recognised by all who contribute to it, it is plain that such
assessment, in order to be lawful, must be voluntary; it must depend,
not indeed on a particular will, as if it were necessary to have the
consent of each [[individual]], and that he should give no more than just
what he pleased, but on a general will, decided by vote of a majority,
and on the basis of a proportional rating which leaves nothing
arbitrary in the imposition of the tax.

that taxes cannot be legitimately established except by the [[consent]] of
the [[people]] or its representatives, is a [[truth]] generally admitted by all
philosophers and jurists of any repute on questions [[question]] of [[public]] [[right]],
not even excepting bodin. if any of them have laid down rules [[rule]] which
seem to contradict this, their particular motives for doing so may
easily be seen; and they introduce so many conditions and restrictions
that the argument comes at bottom to the same thing: for whether the
people has it in its [[power]] to refuse, or the [[sovereign]] ought not to
exact, is a matter of indifference with regard to [[right]]; and if the
point in [[question]] concerns only [[power]], it is useless to inquire whether
it is legitimate or not. contributions levied on the [[people]] are two
kinds; real, levied on commodities, and personal, paid by the head.
both are called taxes or subsidies: when the [[people]] fixes the sum
to be paid, it is called subsidy; but when it grants the product of
an imposition, it is called a tax. we are told in the spirit of the
laws that a capitation tax is most suited to [[slavery]], and a real tax
most in accordance with [[liberty]]. this would be incontestable, if the
circumstances of every [[person]] were [[equal]]; for otherwise nothing can be
more disproportionate than such a tax; and it is in the observations of
exact proportions that the spirit of [[liberty]] consists. but if a tax by
heads were exactly proportioned to the circumstances of individuals [[individual]], as
what is called the capitation tax in [[france]] might be, is would be the
most equitable and consequently the most proper for free-men.

these proportions appear at first very easy to note, because, being
relative to each man's [[man]] position in the [[world]], their incidence is always
public: but proper regard is seldom paid to all the elements that
should enter into such a calculation, even apart from deception arising
from avarice, fraud and self-interest. in the first place, we have
to consider the relation of quantities, according to which, _ceteris
paribus_, the [[person]] who has ten times [[time]] the [[property]] of another man
ought to [[pay]] ten times [[time]] as much to the [[state]]. secondly, the relation of
the use made, that is to say, the distinction between necessaries and
superfluities. he who possesses only the [[common]] necessaries of life
should [[pay]] nothing at all, while the tax on him who is in possession
of superfluities may justly be extended to everything he has over and
above mere necessaries. to this he will possibly object that, when
his rank is taken into account, what may be superfluous to a [[man]] of
inferior station is necessary for him. but this is false: for a grandee
has two legs just like a cow-herd, and, like him again, but one belly.
besides, these pretended necessaries are really so little necessary
to his rank, that if he should renounce them on any worthy [[occasion]],
he would only be the more honoured. the populace would be ready to
adore a minister who went to council on foot, because he had sold off
his carriages to supply a pressing need of the [[state]]. lastly, to no
man does the [[law]] prescribe magnificence; and propriety is no argument
against [[right]].

a third relation, which is never taken into account, though it ought to
be the [[chief]] consideration, is the advantage that every [[person]] derives
from the social confederacy; for this provides a powerful protection
for the immense possessions of the [[rich]], and hardly leaves the poor
man in quiet possession of the cottage he builds with his own hands.
are not all the advantages of [[society]] for the [[rich]] and powerful?
are not all lucrative posts in their hands? are not all privileges
and exemptions reserved for them alone? is not the [[public]] authority
always on their side? if a [[man]] of eminence robs his creditors, or is
guilty of other knaveries, is he not always assured of impunity? are
not the assaults, acts of [[violence]], assassinations, and even murders
committed by the [[great]], matters that are hushed up in a few months,
and of which nothing more is [[thought]]? but if a [[great]] [[man]] himself is
robbed or insulted, the whole [[police]] [[force]] is immediately in motion,
and woe even to [[innocent]] persons [[person]] who [[chance]] to be suspected. if he has
to pass through any dangerous road, the [[country]] is up in arms to escort
him. if the axle-tree of his chaise breaks, everybody flies to his
assistance. if there is a noise at his door, he speaks but a word, and
all is silent. if he is incommoded by the crowd, he waves his hand and
every one makes way. if his coach is met on the road by a wagon, his
servants are ready to beat the driver's brains out, and fifty honest
pedestrians going quietly about their [[business]] had [[better]] be knocked on
the head than an idle jackanapes be delayed in his coach. yet all this
respect costs him not a farthing: it is the [[rich]] man's [[man]] [[right]], and not
what he buys with his [[wealth]]. how different the case of the [[poor]] man!
the more [[humanity]] owes him, the more [[society]] denies him. every door is
shut against him, even when he has a [[right]] to its being opened: and
if ever he obtains [[justice]], it is with much greater difficulty than
others obtain favours. if the militia is to be raised or the highway
to be mended, he is always given the preference; he always bears the
burden which his richer neighbour has influence enough to get exempted
from. on the least accident that happens to him, everybody avoids him:
if his cart be overturned in the road, so far is he from receiving
any assistance, that he is lucky if he does not get horse-whipped by
the impudent lackeys of some [[young]] duke; in a word, all gratuitous
assistance is denied to the [[poor]] when they need it, just because they
cannot [[pay]] for it. i look upon any [[poor]] [[man]] as totally undone, if he
has the misfortune to have an honest [[heart]], a fine [[daughter]], and a
powerful neighbour.

another no less important [[fact]] is that the losses of the [[poor]] are much
harder to repair than those of the [[rich]], and that the difficulty of
acquisition is always greater in proportion as there is more need for
it. "nothing comes out of nothing," is as true of [[life]] as in physics:
money is the seed of [[money]], and the first guinea is sometimes more
difficult to acquire than the second million. add to this that what
the [[poor]] [[pay]] is lost to them for ever, and remains in, or returns to,
the hands of the [[rich]]: and as, to those who share in the government
or to their dependents, the whole [[produce]] of the taxes must sooner or
later pass, although they [[pay]] their share, these persons [[person]] have always a
sensible interest in increasing them.

the terms of the social compact between these two estates of [[men]] may
be summed up in a few words. "you have need of me, because i am rich
and you are [[poor]]. we will therefore come to an agreement. i will permit
you to have the [[honour]] of serving me, on condition that you bestow on
me the little you have left, in return for the pains [[pain]] i shall take to
command you."

putting all these considerations carefully together, we shall find
that, in order to levy taxes in a truly equitable and proportionate
manner, the imposition ought not to be in simple ratio to the property
of the contributors, but in compound ratio to the difference of
their conditions and the superfluity of their possessions. this very
important and difficult operation is daily made by numbers of honest
clerks, who [[know]] their arithmetic; but a [[plato]] or a montesquieu would
not venture to undertake it without the [[greatest]] diffidence, or
without praying to [[heaven]] for understanding and integrity.

another disadvantage of personal taxes is that they may be too much
felt or raised with too [[great]] severity. this, however, does not prevent
them from being frequently evaded; for it is much easier for persons [[person]] to
escape a tax than for their possessions.

of all impositions, that on [[land]], or real [[taxation]], has always been
regarded as most advantageous in countries [[country]] where more attention is
paid to what the tax will [[produce]], and to the certainty of recovering
the product, than to securing the least discomfort for the [[people]]. it
has been even maintained that it is necessary to burden the peasant
in order to rouse him from indolence, and that he would never work
if he had no taxes to [[pay]]. but in all countries [[country]] [[experience]] confutes
this ridiculous notion. in [[england]] and holland the [[farmer]] pays [[pay]] very
little, and in [[china]] nothing: yet these are the countries [[country]] in which the
land is [[best]] cultivated. on the other hand, in those countries [[country]] where
the husbandman is taxed in proportion to the [[produce]] of his lands [[land]], he
leaves them uncultivated, or reaps just as much from them as suffices
for bare subsistence. for to him who loses the fruit of his [[labour]], it
is some gain to do nothing. to lay a tax on industry is a very singular
expedient for banishing idleness.

taxes on [[land]] or corn, especially when they are excessive, lead to two
results so fatal in their effect that they cannot but depopulate and
ruin, in the long run, all countries [[country]] in which they are established.

the first of these arises from the defective circulation of specie;
for industry and commerce draw all the [[money]] from the [[country]] into the
capitals: and as the tax destroys the proportion there might otherwise
be between the needs of the husbandman and the price of his corn, money
is always leaving and never returning. thus the richer the [[city]] the
poorer the [[country]]. the product of the taxes passes from the hands of
the [[prince]] or his financial officers into those of artists and traders;
and the husbandman, who receives, only the smallest part of it, is at
length exhausted by paying always the same, and receiving constantly
less. how could a [[human]] [[body]] subsist if it had veins and no arteries,
or if its arteries conveyed the [[blood]] only within four inches of the
heart? chardin tells us that in [[persia]] the [[royal]] dues on commodities
are paid in [[kind]]: this custom, which, herodotus informs us, prevailed
long ago in the same [[country]] down to the [[time]] of darius, might prevent
the [[evil]] of which i have been speaking. but unless intendants,
directors, commissioners and warehousemen in [[persia]] are a different
kind of [[people]] from what they are elsewhere, i can hardly believe
that the smallest part of this [[produce]] ever reaches the [[king]], or that
the corn is not spoilt in every granary, and the greater part of the
warehouses not consumed by [[fire]].

the second [[evil]] effect arises from an apparent advantage, which
aggravates the [[evil]] before it can be perceived. that is that corn is a
commodity whose price is not enhanced by taxes in the [[country]] producing
it, and which, in spite of its absolute necessity, may be diminished
in quantity without the price being increased. hence, many [[people]] die
of [[hunger]], although corn remains cheap, and the husbandman bears the
whole charge of a tax, for which he cannot indemnify himself by the
price of his corn. it must be observed that we ought not to reason
about a land-tax in the same manner as about duties [[duty]] laid on various
kinds of merchandise; for the effect of such duties [[duty]] is to raise the
price, and they are paid by the buyers rather than the sellers. for
these duties [[duty]], however heavy, are still voluntary, and are paid by the
merchant only in proportion to the quantity he buys; and as he buys
only in proportion to his sale, he himself gives the [[law]] its particular
application; but the [[farmer]] who is obliged to [[pay]] his rent at stated
times, whether he sells or not, cannot wait till he can get his own
price for his commodity: even if he is not forced to sell for mere
subsistence, he must sell to [[pay]] the taxes; so that it is frequently
the heaviness of the tax that keeps the price of corn low.

it is further to be noticed that the resources of commerce and industry
are so far from rendering the tax more supportable through abundance
of [[money]], that they only render it more burdensome. i shall not insist
on what is very evident; _i.e._ that, although a greater or less
quantity of [[money]] in a [[state]] may give it the greater or less credit in
the eye of the foreigner, it makes not the least difference to the
real [[fortune]] of the [[citizens]], and does not make their condition any
more or less comfortable. but i must make these two important remarks:
first, unless a [[state]] possesses superfluous commodities, and abundance
of [[money]] results from [[foreign]] [[trade]], only trading cities [[city]] are sensible
of the abundance; while the peasant only becomes relatively poorer.
secondly, as the price of everything is enhanced by the increase of
money, taxes also must be proportionately increased; so that the farmer
will find himself still more burdened without having more resources.

it ought to be observed that the tax on [[land]] is a real [[duty]] on the
produce. it is universally agreed, however, that nothing is so
dangerous as a tax on corn paid by the purchaser: but how comes it we
do not see that it is a hundred times [[time]] worse when the [[duty]] is paid by
the cultivator himself? is not this an attack on the substance of the
state at its very source? is it not the directest possible method of
depopulating a [[country]], and therefore in the end ruining it? for the
worst [[kind]] of scarcity a nation can suffer from is lack of inhabitants.

only the real statesman can rise, in imposing taxes, above the
mere financial object: he alone can transform heavy burdens into
useful regulations, and make the [[people]] even doubtful whether such
establishments were not calculated rather for the [[good]] of the nation in
general, than merely for the raising of [[money]].

duties on the importation of [[foreign]] commodities, of which the natives
are fond, without the [[country]] standing in need of them; on the
exportation of those of the [[growth]] of the [[country]] which are not too
plentiful, and which foreigners cannot do without; on the productions
of frivolous and all too lucrative [[arts]]; on the importation of all pure
luxuries; and in general on all objects of luxury; will [[answer]] the
two-fold end in view. it is by such taxes, indeed, by which the poor
are eased, and the burdens thrown on the [[rich]], that it is possible to
prevent the continual increase of inequality of [[fortune]]; the subjection
of such a multitude of artisans and useless servants to the [[rich]], the
multiplication of idle persons [[person]] in our cities [[city]], and the depopulation of
the country-side.

it is important that the value of any commodity and the duties [[duty]] laid
on it should be so proportioned that the avarice of individuals [[individual]] may
not be too strongly tempted to fraud by the greatness of the possible
profit. to make smuggling difficult, those commodities should be
singled out which are hardest to conceal. all duties [[duty]] should be rather
paid by the consumer of the commodity taxed than by him who sells it:
as the quantity of [[duty]] he would be obliged to [[pay]] would lay him open
to greater temptations, and afford him more opportunities for fraud.

this is the constant custom in [[china]], a [[country]] where the taxes are
greater and yet [[better]] paid than in any other part of the [[world]].
the merchant himself there pays [[pay]] no [[duty]]; the buyer alone, without
murmuring or sedition, meets the whole charge; for as the necessaries
of [[life]], such as rice and corn, are absolutely exempt from [[taxation]],
the [[common]] [[people]] is not [[oppressed]], and the [[duty]] falls only on those
who are well-to-do. precautions against smuggling ought not to be
dictated so much by the [[fear]] of it occurring, as by the attention which
the [[government]] should [[pay]] to securing individuals [[individual]] from being seduced
by illegitimate profits [[profit]], which first make them [[bad]] [[citizens]], and
afterwards soon turn them into dishonest [[men]].

heavy taxes should be laid on servants in livery, on equipages, rich
furniture, fine clothes, on spacious courts and gardens, on public
entertainments of all kinds [[kind]], on useless professions, such as dancers,
singers, players, and in a word, on all that multiplicity of objects
of luxury, amusement and idleness, which strike the [[eyes]] of all, and
can the less be hidden, as their whole [[purpose]] is to be seen, without
which they would be useless. we need be under no apprehension of the
produce of these taxes being arbitrary, because they are laid on things
not absolutely necessary. they must [[know]] but little of [[mankind]] who
imagine that, after they have been once seduced by luxury, they can
ever renounce it: they would a hundred times [[time]] sooner renounce common
necessaries, and had much rather [[die]] of [[hunger]] than of shame. the
increase in their expense is only an additional [[reason]] for supporting
them, when the vanity of appearing wealthy reaps its [[profit]] from the
price of the thing and the charge of the tax. as long as there are rich
people in the [[world]], they will be desirous of distinguishing themselves
from the [[poor]], nor can the [[state]] devise a [[revenue]] less burdensome or
more [[certain]] than what arises from this distinction.

for the same [[reason]], industry would have nothing to suffer from an
economic [[system]] which increased the [[revenue]], encouraged agriculture by
relieving the husbandman, and insensibly tended to bring all fortunes
nearer to that middle condition which constitutes the [[genuine]] strength
of the [[state]]. these taxes might, i admit, bring [[certain]] fashionable
articles of dress and amusement to an untimely end; but it would be
only to substitute others, by which the artificer would gain, and the
exchequer suffer no loss. in a word, suppose the spirit of government
was constantly to tax only the superfluities of the [[rich]], one of two
things must happen: either the [[rich]] would convert their superfluous
expenses into useful ones, which would redound to the [[profit]] of the
state, and thus the imposition of taxes would have the effect of the
best sumptuary laws [[law]], the expenses of the [[state]] would necessarily
diminish with those of individuals [[individual]], and the treasury would not receive
so much less as it would gain by having less to [[pay]]; or, if the
rich did not become less extravagant, the exchequer would have such
resources in the product of taxes on their expenditure as would provide
for the needs of the [[state]]. in the first case the treasury would be
the richer by what it would save, from having the less to do with its
money; and in the second, it would be enriched by the useless expenses
of individuals [[individual]].

we may add to all this a very important distinction in matters of
political [[right]], to which governments [[government]], constantly tenacious of doing
everything for themselves, ought to [[pay]] [[great]] attention. it has been
observed that personal taxes and duties [[duty]] on the necessaries of [[life]], as
they directly trespass on the [[right]] of [[property]], and consequently on
the true foundation of [[political]] [[society]], are always liable to have
dangerous results, if they are not established with the express consent
of the [[people]] or its representatives. it is not the same with articles
the use of which we can deny ourselves; for as the [[individual]] is under
no absolute necessity to [[pay]], his contribution may count as voluntary.
the particular [[consent]] of each contributor then takes the place of the
general [[consent]] of the whole [[people]]: for why should a [[people]] oppose the
imposition of a tax which falls only on those who [[desire]] to [[pay]] it? it
appears to me [[certain]] that everything, which is not proscribed by [[law]],
or contrary to morality, and yet may be prohibited by the [[government]],
may also be permitted on payment of a [[certain]] [[duty]]. thus, for [[example]],
if the [[government]] may prohibit the use of coaches, it may certainly
impose a tax on them; and this is a prudent and useful method of
censuring their use without absolutely forbidding it. in this case, the
tax may be regarded as a sort of fine, the product of which compensates
for the [[abuse]] it punishes.

it may perhaps be objected that those, whom bodin calls _impostors_,
_i.e._ those who impose or contrive the taxes, being in the class of
the [[rich]], will be far from sparing themselves to relieve the [[poor]]. but
this is quite beside the point. if, in every nation, those to whom
the [[sovereign]] commits the [[government]] of the [[people]], were, from their
position, its enemies [[enemy]], it would not be worth while to inquire what they
ought to do to make the [[people]] [[happy]].
