----------------------------------------------------------------------

the same as in oedipus the [[king]], an open space before the [[royal]] palace,
once that of oedipus, at thebes. the backscene represents the front
of the palace, with three doors, of which the central and largest
is the principal entrance into the house. the [[time]] is at daybreak
on the morning after the fall of the two brothers [[brother]], eteocles and polyneices,
and the flight of the defeated argives. antigone calls ismene forth
from the palace, in order to speak to her alone.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

antigone ismene, sister, mine own dear sister, knowest thou what
ill there is, of all bequeathed by oedipus, that [[zeus]] fulfils not
for us twain while we [[live]]? nothing painful is there, nothing fraught
with ruin, no shame, no dishonour, that i have not seen in thy woes
and mine. 

and now what new edict is this of which they tell, that our captain
hath just published to all thebes? knowest thou aught? hast thou heard?
or is it hidden from thee that our [[friends]] are threatened with the
doom of our foes? 

ismene no word of [[friends]], antigone, gladsome or painful, hath come
to me, since we two sisters were bereft of brothers [[brother]] twain, killed
in one day by twofold blow; and since in this [[last]] night the argive
host hath fled, [[know]] no more, whether my [[fortune]] be brighter, or more
grievous. 

antigone i knew it well, and therefore sought to bring thee beyond
the gates of the court, that thou mightest hear alone. 

ismene what is it? 'tis plain that thou art [[arts]] brooding on some dark
tidings. 

antigone what, hath not creon destined our brothers [[brother]], the one to honoured
burial, the other to unburied shame? eteocles, they say, with due
observance of [[right]] and custom, he hath laid in the [[earth]], for his
honour among the [[dead]] below. but the hapless corpse of polyneices-as
rumour saith, it hath been published to the town that none shall entomb
him or mourn, but leave unwept, unsepulchred, a welcome store for
the birds, as they espy him, to feast on at will. 

such, 'tis said, is the edict that the [[good]] creon hath set forth for
thee and for me,-yes, for me,-and is coming hither to proclaim it
clearly to those who [[know]] it not; nor counts the matter [[light]], but,
whoso disobeys in aught, his doom is [[death]] by stoning before all the
folk. thou knowest it now; and thou wilt soon show whether thou art
nobly bred, or the base [[daughter]] of a [[noble]] line. 

ismene [[poor]] sister,-and if things stand thus, what could i [[help]] to
do or undo? 

antigone consider if thou wilt share the toil and the deed.

ismene in what venture? what can be thy meaning? 

antigone wilt thou aid this hand to lift the [[dead]]? 

ismene thou wouldst bury him,-when 'tis forbidden to thebes?

antigone i will do my part,-and thine, if thou wilt not,-to a [[brother]].
false to him will i never be found. 

ismene ah, over-bold! when creon hath forbidden? 

antigone nay, he hath no [[right]] to keep me from mine own.

ismene ah me! [[think]], sister, how our [[father]] perished, amid hate and
scorn, when sins [[sin]] bared by his own search had moved him to strike both
eyes with self-blinding hand; then the [[mother]] [[wife]], two names in one,
with twisted noose did despite unto her [[life]]; and [[last]], our two brothers
in one day,-each shedding, hapless one, a kinsman's [[blood]],-wrought
out with mutual hands their [[common]] doom. and now we in turn-we two
left all alone [[think]] how we shall perish, more miserably than all
the rest, if, in defiance of the [[law]], we brave a king's decree or
his powers [[power]]. nay, we must [[remember]], first, that we were born [[women]],
as who should not strive with [[men]]; next, that we are ruled of the
stronger, so that we must obey in these things, and in things yet
sorer. i, therefore, asking the spirits infernal to pardon, seeing
that [[force]] is put on me herein, will hearken to our rulers. for 'tis
witless to be over busy. 

antigone i will not urge thee,-no nor, if thou yet shouldst have
the [[mind]], wouldst thou be welcome as a worker with me. nay, be what
thou wilt; but i will bury him: well for me to [[die]] in doing that.
i shall rest, a loved one with him whom i have loved, sinless in my
crime; for i owe a longer allegiance to the [[dead]] than to the living:
in that [[world]] i shall abide for ever. but if thou wilt, be guilty
of dishonouring laws [[law]] which the gods have stablished in [[honour]].

ismene i do them no dishonour; but to defy the [[state]],-i have no strength
for that. 

antigone such be thy plea:-i, then, will go to heap the [[earth]] above
the [[brother]] whom i [[love]]. 

ismene alas, unhappy one! how i [[fear]] for thee! 

antigone [[fear]] not for me: guide thine own [[fate]] aright. 

ismene: at least, then, disclose this plan to none, but hide it closely,-and
so, too, will i. 

antigone oh, denounce it! thou wilt be far more hateful for thy [[silence]],
if thou proclaim not these things to all. 

ismene thou hast a hot [[heart]] for chilling deeds. 

antigone i [[know]] that i please where i am most bound to please.

ismene aye, if thou canst; but thou wouldst what thou canst not.

antigone why, then, when my [[strength]] fails, i shall have done.

ismene a hopeless quest should not be made at all. 

antigone if thus thou speakest, thou wilt have [[hatred]] from me, and
will justly be [[subject]] to the lasting [[hatred]] of the [[dead]]. but leave
me, and the folly that is mine alone, to suffer this dread thing;
for i shall not suffer aught so dreadful as an ignoble [[death]].

ismene go, then, if thou must; and of this be sure,-that though thine
errand is foolish, to thy dear ones thou art [[arts]] truly dear.  (exit antigone
on the spectators' left. ismene retires into the palace by one of
the two side-doors. when they have departed, the chorus of theban
elders enters.)  

chorus  (singing, strophe 1)

beam of the sun, fairest [[light]] that ever dawned on thebe of the seven
gates, thou hast shone forth at [[last]], eye of golden day, arisen above
dirce's streams! the warrior of the [[white]] shield, who came from argos
in his panoply, hath been stirred by thee to headlong flight, in swifter
career; 

leader of the chorus (systema 1)

who set forth against our [[land]] by [[reason]] of the vexed claims of polyneices;
and, like shrill-screaming eagle, he flew over into our [[land]], in snow-white
pinion sheathed, with an armed throng, and with plumage of helms.

chorus (antistrophe 1)

he paused above our dwellings; he ravened around our sevenfold portals
with spears athirst for [[blood]]; but he went hence, or ever his jaws
were glutted with our gore, or the fire-god's pine-fed flame had seized
our [[crown]] of towers. so fierce was the noise of [[battle]] raised behind
him, a thing too hard for him to conquer, as he wrestled with his
dragon foe. 

leader (systema 2)

for [[zeus]] utterly abhors the boasts of a proud tongue; and when he
beheld them coming on in a [[great]] stream, in the haughty [[pride]] of clanging
gold, he smote with brandished [[fire]] one who was now hasting to shout
victory at his goal upon our ramparts. 

chorus (strophe 2)

swung down, he fell on the [[earth]] with a crash, torch in hand, he
who so lately, in the frenzy of the mad onset, was raging against
us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate. but those threats fared
not as he hoped; and to other foes the mighty war-god dispensed their
several dooms, dealing havoc around, a mighty helper at our need.

leader (systema 3)

for seven captains at seven gates, matched against seven, left the
tribute of their panoplies to [[zeus]] who turns the [[battle]]; save those
two of cruel [[fate]], who, born of one sire and one [[mother]], set against
each other their twain conquering spears, and are sharers in a common
death. 

chorus (antistrophe 2)

but since [[victory]] of glorious name hath come to us, with joy responsive
to the joy of thebe whose chariots are many, let us enjoy forgetfulness
after the late wars [[war]], and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long
dance and [[song]]; and may bacchus be our leader, whose dancing shakes
the [[land]] of thebe. 

leader (systema 4)

but lo, the [[king]] of the [[land]] comes yonder, creon, [[son]] of menoeceus,
our new ruler by the new fortunes [[fortune]] that the gods have given; what counsel
is he pondering, that he hath proposed this special conference of
elders, summoned by his general mandate?  (enter creon, from the central
doors of the palace, in the garb of [[king]], with two attendants.)

creon sirs, the vessel of our [[state]], after being tossed on wild waves,
hath once more been safely steadied by the gods: and ye, out of all
the folk, have been called apart by my summons, because i knew, first
of all, how true and constant was your reverence for the [[royal]] power
of laius; how, again, when oedipus was ruler of our [[land]], and when
he had perished, your steadfast loyalty still upheld their [[children]].
since, then, his sons [[son]] have fallen in one day by a twofold doom,-each
smitten by the other, each stained with a brother's [[blood]],-i now possess
the [[throne]] and all its powers [[power]], by nearness of kinship to the [[dead]].

no [[man]] can be fully known, in [[soul]] and spirit and [[mind]], until he hath
been seen versed in [[rule]] and law-giving. for if any, being supreme
guide of the [[state]], cleaves not to the [[best]] counsels, but, through
some [[fear]], keeps his lips locked, i hold, and have ever held, him
most base; and if any makes a friend of more account than his fatherland,
that [[man]] hath no place in my regard. for i-be [[zeus]] my witness, who
sees all things always-would not be silent if i saw ruin, instead
of safety, coming to the [[citizens]]; nor would i ever deem the country's
foe a friend to myself; remembering this, that our [[country]] is the
ship that bears us safe, and that only while she prospers in our voyage
can we make true [[friends]]. 

such are the rules [[rule]] by which i guard this city's greatness. and in
accord with them is the edict which i have now published to the folk
touching the sons [[son]] of oedipus;-that eteocles, who hath fallen fighting
for our [[city]], in all renown of arms, shall be entombed, and crowned
with every rite that follows the noblest [[dead]] to their rest. but for
his [[brother]], polyneices,-who came back from [[exile]], and sought to consume
utterly with [[fire]] the [[city]] of his fathers [[father]] and the shrines of his fathers'
gods,-sought to taste of kindred [[blood]], and to lead the remnant into
slavery;-touching this [[man]], it hath been proclaimed to our people
that none shall grace him with sepulture or lament, but leave him
unburied, a corpse for birds and dogs to [[eat]], a ghastly sight of shame.

such the spirit of my dealing; and never, by deed of mine, shall the
wicked stand in [[honour]] before the just; but whoso hath [[good]] will to
thebes, he shall be honoured of me, in his [[life]] and in his [[death]].

leader of the chorus such is thy [[pleasure]], creon, [[son]] of menoeceus,
touching this city's foe, and its friend; and thou hast [[power]], i ween,
to take what order thou wilt, both for the [[dead]], and for all us who
live. 

creon see, then, that ye be guardians of the mandate. 

leader lay the burden of this task on some younger [[man]].

creon nay, watchers of the corpse have been found. 

leader what, then, is this further charge that thou wouldst give?

creon that ye side not with the breakers of these commands.

leader no [[man]] is so foolish that he is enamoured of [[death]].

creon in sooth, that is the meed; yet lucre hath oft ruined [[men]] through
their hopes [[hope]].  (a guard enters from the spectators' left.)

guard my liege, i will not say that i come breathless from speed,
or that have plied a nimble foot; for often did my thoughts [[thought]] make me
pause, and wheel round in my path, to return. my [[mind]] was holding
large discourse with me; 'fool, why goest thou to thy [[certain]] doom?'
'wretch, tarrying again? and if creon hears this from another, must
not thou smart for it?' so debating, i went on my way with lagging
steps, and thus a short road was made long. at [[last]], however, it carried
the day that i should come hither-to thee; and, though my tale be
nought, yet will i tell it; for i come with a [[good]] grip on one [[hope]],-that
i can suffer nothing but what is my [[fate]]. 

creon and what is it that disquiets thee thus? 

guard i [[wish]] to tell thee first about myself-i did not do the deed-i
did not see the doer-it were not [[right]] that i should come to any harm.

creon thou hast a shrewd eye for thy mark; well dost thou fence thyself
round against the blame; clearly thou hast some [[strange]] thing to tell.

guard aye, truly; dread news makes one pause long. 

creon then tell it, wilt thou, and so get thee gone? 

guard well, this is it.-the corpse-some one hath just given it burial,
and gone away,-after sprinkling thirsty dust on the flesh, with such
other rites as piety enjoins. 

creon what sayest thou? what living [[man]] hath dared this deed?

guard i [[know]] not; no stroke of pickaxe was seen there, no [[earth]] thrown
up by mattock; the ground was hard and dry, unbroken, without track
of wheels; the doer was one who had left no trace. and when the first
day-watchman showed it to us, sore wonder fell on all. the [[dead]] man
was veiled from us; not shut within a tomb, but lightly strewn with
dust, as by the hand of one who shunned a curse. and no sign met the
eye as though any beast of prey or any dog had come nigh to him, or
torn him. 

then [[evil]] words flew fast and loud among us, guard accusing guard;
und it would e'en have come to blows at [[last]], nor was there any to
hinder. every [[man]] was the culprit, and no one was convicted, but all
disclaimed [[knowledge]] of the deed. and we were ready to take red-hot
iron in our hands;-to walk through [[fire]];-to make oath by the gods
that we had not done the deed,-that we were not privy to the planning
or the doing. 

at [[last]], when all our searching was fruitless, one spake, who made
us all bend our faces on the [[earth]] in [[fear]]; for we saw not how we
could gainsay him, or escape mischance if we obeyed. his counsel was
that this deed must be reported to thee, and not hidden. and this
seemed [[best]]; and the lot doomed my hapless [[self]] to [[win]] this prize.
so here i stand,-as unwelcome as unwilling, well i wot; for no man
delights in the bearer of [[bad]] news. 

leader o [[king]], my thoughts [[thought]] have long been whispering, can this deed,
perchance, be e'en the [[work]] of gods? 

creon cease, ere thy words fill me utterly with wrath, lest thou
be found at once an old [[man]] and foolish. for thou sayest what is not
to be borne, in saying that the gods have [[care]] for this corpse. was
it for high [[reward]] of trusty service that they sought to hide his
nakedness, who came to burn their pillared shrines and [[sacred]] treasures,
to burn their [[land]], and scatter its laws [[law]] to the winds? or dost thou
behold the gods honouring the wicked? it cannot be. no! from the first
there were [[certain]] in the town that muttered against me, chafing at
this edict, wagging their heads in secret; and kept not their necks
duly under the yoke, like [[men]] contented with my sway. 

'tis by them, well i [[know]], that these have been beguiled and bribed
to do this deed. nothing so [[evil]] as [[money]] ever grew to be current
among [[men]]. this lays cities [[city]] low, this drives [[men]] from their homes [[home]],
this trains and warps honest souls [[soul]] till they set themselves to works
of shame; this still teaches [[teach]] folk to practise villainies, and to know
every godless deed. 

but all the [[men]] who wrought this thing for hire have made it sure
that, soon or late, they shall [[pay]] the price. now, as [[zeus]] still hath
my reverence, [[know]] this-i tell it thee on my oath:-if ye find not
the very author of this burial, and [[produce]] him before mine [[eyes]],
death alone shall not be enough for you, till first, hung up alive,
ye have revealed this outrage,-that henceforth ye may thieve with
better [[knowledge]] whence lucre should be won, and learn that it is
not well to [[love]] gain from every source. for thou wilt find that ill-gotten
pelf brings more [[men]] to ruin than to weal. 

guard may i speak? or shall i just turn and go? 

creon knowest thou not that even now thy voice offends?

guard is thy smart in the ears, or in the [[soul]]? 

creon and why wouldst thou define the seat of my [[pain]]? 

guard the doer vexes thy [[mind]], but i, thine ears. 

creon ah, thou art [[arts]] a born babbler, 'tis well seen. 

guard may be, but never the doer of this deed. 

creon yea, and more,-the seller of thy [[life]] for silver.

guard alas! 'tis [[sad]], truly, that he who judges [[judge]] should misjudge.

creon let thy fancy play with 'judgment' as it will;-but, if ye show
me not the doers of these things, ye shall avow that dastardly gains
work sorrows [[sorrow]].  (creon goes into the palace.)  

guard well, may he be found! so 'twere [[best]]. but, be he caught or
be he not-fortune must settle that-truly thou wilt not see me here
again. saved, even now, beyond [[hope]] and [[thought]], i owe the gods great
thanks.  (the guard goes out on the spectators' left.)  

chorus  (singing, strophe 1)

wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than [[man]]; the power
that crosses the [[white]] sea, driven by the stormy south-wind, making
a path under surges that threaten to engulf him; and [[earth]], the eldest
of the gods, the [[immortal]], the unwearied, doth he wear, turning the
soil with the offspring of horses, as the ploughs go to and fro from
year to year. 

(antistrophe 1)

and the light-hearted [[race]] of birds, and the tribes of savage beasts,
and the sea-brood of the deep, he snares in the meshes of his woven
toils, he leads captive, [[man]] excellent in wit. and he masters by his
arts the beast whose lair is in the wilds, who roams the hills; he
tames the horse of shaggy mane, he puts the yoke upon its neck, he
tames the tireless mountain bull. 

(strophe 2)

and [[speech]], and wind-swift [[thought]], and all the moods that mould
a [[state]], hath he taught himself; and how to flee the arrows of the
frost, when 'tis hard lodging under the clear [[sky]], and the arrows
of the rushing rain; yea, he hath resource for all; without resource
he meets nothing that must come: only against [[death]] shall he call
for aid in [[vain]]; but from baffling maladies he hath devised escapes.

(antistrophe 2)

cunning beyond fancy's [[dream]] is the fertile [[skill]] which brings him,
now to [[evil]], now to [[good]]. when he honours [[honour]] the laws [[law]] of the [[land]], and
that [[justice]] which he hath sworn by the gods to uphold, proudly stands
his [[city]]: no [[city]] hath he who, for his rashness, dwells with [[sin]].
never may he share my hearth, never [[think]] my thoughts [[thought]], who doth these
things!  (enter the guard on the spectators' left, leading in antigone.)

leader of the chorus what portent from the gods is this?-my soul
is amazed. i [[know]] her-how can i deny that yon maiden is antigone?

o hapless, and child of hapless sire,-of oedipus! what means this?
thou brought a [[prisoner]]?-thou, disloyal to the king's laws [[law]], and taken
in folly? 

guard here she is, the doer of the deed:-caught this girl burying
him:-but where is creon?  (creon enters hurriedly from the palace.)

leader lo, he comes forth again from the house, at our need.

creon what is it? what hath chanced, that makes my coming timely?

guard o [[king]], against nothing should [[men]] pledge their word; for the
after-thought belies the first intent. i could have vowed that i should
not soon be here again,-scared by thy threats, with which i had just
been lashed: but,-since the joy that surprises and transcends our
hopes is like in fulness to no other [[pleasure]],-i have come, though
'tis in breach of my sworn oath, bringing this maid; who was taken
showing grace to the [[dead]]. this [[time]] there was no casting of lots;
no, this [[luck]] hath fallen to me, and to none else. and now, sire,
take her thyself, [[question]] her, examine her, as thou wilt; but i have
a [[right]] to [[free]] and final quittance of this trouble. 

creon and thy [[prisoner]] here-how and whence hast thou taken her?

guard she was burying the [[man]]; thou knowest all. 

creon dost thou mean what thou sayest? dost thou speak aright?

guard i saw her burying the corpse that thou hadst forbidden to bury.
is that plain and clear? 

creon and how was she seen? how taken in the act? 

guard it befell on this [[wise]]. when we had come to the place,-with
those dread menaces of thine upon us,-we swept away all the dust that
covered the corpse, and bared the dank [[body]] well; and then sat us
down on the brow of the hill, to windward, heedful that the smell
from him should not strike us; every [[man]] was wide awake, and kept
his neighbour alert with torrents of threats, if anyone should be
careless of this task. 

so went it, until the sun's bright orb stood in mid [[heaven]], and the
heat began to burn: and then suddenly a whirlwind lifted from the
earth storm of dust, a trouble in the [[sky]] the plain, marring all the
leafage of its woods; and the wide air was choked therewith: we closed
our [[eyes]], and bore the plague from the gods. 

and when, after a long while, this storm had passed, the maid was
seen; and she cried aloud with the sharp cry of a bird in its bitterness,-even
as when, within the empty nest, it sees the bed stripped of its nestlings.
so she also, when she saw the corpse bare, lifted up a voice of wailing,
and called down curses on the doers of that deed. and straightway
she brought thirsty dust in her hands; and from a shapely ewer of
bronze, held high, with thrice-poured drink-offering she crowned the
dead. 

we rushed forward when we saw it, and at once dosed upon our quarry,
who was in no [[wise]] dismayed. then we taxed her with her [[past]] and present
doings; and she stood not on denial of aught,-at once to my joy and
to my [[pain]]. to have escaped from ills one's [[self]] is a [[great]] joy; but
'tis painful to bring [[friends]] to ill. howbeit, all such things are
of less account to me than mine own safety. 

creon thou-thou whose face is bent to earth-dost thou avow, or disavow,
this deed? 

antigone i avow it; i make no denial. 

creon  (to guard) thou canst betake thee whither thou wilt, free
and clear of a grave charge.  (exit guard, to antigone)  now, tell
me thou-not in many words, but briefly-knewest thou that an edict
had forbidden this? 

antigone i knew it: could i [[help]] it? it was [[public]]. 

creon and thou didst indeed dare to transgress that [[law]]?

antigone yes; for it was not [[zeus]] that had published me that edict;
not such are the laws [[law]] set among [[men]] by the [[justice]] who dwells with
the gods below; nor deemed i that thy decrees were of such [[force]],
that a mortal could override the unwritten and unfailing statutes
of [[heaven]]. for their [[life]] is not of to-day or yesterday, but from
all [[time]], and no [[man]] knows [[know]] when they were first put forth.

not through dread of any [[human]] [[pride]] could i [[answer]] to the gods for
breaking these. [[die]] i must,-i knew that well (how should i not?)-even
without thy edicts. but if i am to [[die]] before my [[time]], i count that
a gain: for when any one lives [[life]], as i do, compassed about with evils [[evil]],
can such an one find aught but gain in [[death]]? 

so for me to meet this doom is trifling [[grief]]; but if i had suffered
my mother's [[son]] to [[lie]] in [[death]] an unburied corpse, that would have
grieved me; for this, i am not [[grieved]]. and if my [[present]] deeds are
foolish in thy sight, it may be that a foolish [[judge]] arraigns my folly.

leader of the chorus the maid shows herself passionate child of passionate
sire, and knows [[know]] not how to bend before troubles. 

creon yet i would have thee [[know]] that o'er-stubborn spirits are most
often humbled; 'tis the stiffest iron, baked to hardness in the [[fire]],
that thou shalt oftenest see snapped and shivered; and i have known
horses that show temper brought to order by a little curb; there is
no room for [[pride]] when thou art [[arts]] thy neighbour's [[slave]].-this girl was
already versed in insolence when she transgressed the laws [[law]] that had
been set forth; and, that done, lo, a second insult,-to vaunt of this,
and exult in her deed. 

now verily i am no [[man]], she is the [[man]], if this [[victory]] shall rest
with her, and bring no penalty. no! be she sister's child, or nearer
to me in [[blood]] than any that worships [[zeus]] at the altar of our house,-she
and her kinsfolk shall not avoid a doom most dire; for indeed i charge
that other with a like share in the plotting of this burial.

and summon her-for i saw her e'en now within,-raving, and not mistress
of her wits. so oft, before the deed, the [[mind]] stands self-convicted
in its [[treason]], when folks are plotting mischief in the dark. but
verily this, too, is hateful,-when one who hath been caught in wickednes
then seeks to make the crime a [[glory]]. 

antigone wouldst thou do more than take and slay me? 

creon no more, indeed; having that, i have all. 

antigone why then dost thou delay? in thy discourse there is nought
that pleases me,-never may there be!-and so my words must needs be
unpleasing to thee. and yet, for glory-whence could i have won a nobler,
than by giving burial to mine own [[brother]]? all here would own that
they [[thought]] it well, were not their lips sealed by [[fear]]. but royalty,
blest in so much besides, hath the [[power]] to do and say what it will.

creon thou differest from all these thebans in that view.

antigone these also share it; but they curb their tongues for thee.

creon and art [[arts]] thou not ashamed to act apart from them? 

antigone no; there is nothing shameful in piety to a [[brother]].

creon was it not a [[brother]], too, that died in the opposite cause?

antigone [[brother]] by the same [[mother]] and the same sire. 

creon why, then, dost thou render a grace that is impious in his
sight? 

antigone the [[dead]] [[man]] will not say that he so deems it.

creon yea, if thou makest him but [[equal]] in [[honour]] with the wicked.

antigone it was his [[brother]], not his [[slave]], that perished.

creon wasting this [[land]]; while he fell as its champion.

antigone nevertheless, [[hades]] desires [[desire]] these rites. 

creon but the [[good]] desires [[desire]] not a like portion with the [[evil]].

antigone who knows [[know]] but this seems blameless in the [[world]] below?

creon a foe is never a friend-not even in [[death]]. 

antigone tis not my [[nature]] to join in hating, but in loving.

creon pass, then, to the [[world]] of the [[dead]], and, it thou must needs
love, [[love]] them. while i [[live]], no woman shall [[rule]] me.  (enter ismene
from the house, [[led]] in by two attendants.)  

chorus  (chanting) lo, yonder ismene comes forth, shedding such tears
as fond sisters weep; a cloud upon her brow casts its shadow over
her darkly-flushing face, and breaks in rain on her [[fair]] cheek.

creon and thou, who, lurking like a viper in my house, wast secretly
draining my life-blood, while i knew not that i was nurturing two
pests, to rise against my throne-come, tell me now, wilt thou also
confess thy part in this burial, or wilt thou forswear all knowledge
of it? 

ismene i have done the deed,-if she allows my claim,-and share the
burden of the charge. 

antigone nay, [[justice]] will not suffer thee to do that: thou didst
not [[consent]] to the deed, nor did i give thee part in it.

ismene but, now that ills beset thee, i am not ashamed to sail the
sea of trouble at thy side. 

antigone whose was the deed, [[hades]] and the [[dead]] are witnesses: a
friend in words is not the friend that i [[love]]. 

ismene nay, sister, reject me not, but let me [[die]] with thee, and
duly [[honour]] the [[dead]]. 

antigone share not thou my [[death]], nor claim deeds to which thou hast
not put thy hand: my [[death]] will suffice. 

ismene and what [[life]] is dear to me, bereft of thee? 

antigone ask creon; all thy [[care]] is for him. 

ismene why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought? 

antigone indeed, if i mock, 'tis with [[pain]] that i mock thee.

ismene tell me,-how can i serve thee, even now? 

antigone save thyself: i grudge not thy escape. 

ismene ah, woe is me! and shall i have no share in thy [[fate]]?

antigone thy [[choice]] was to [[live]]; mine, to [[die]]. 

ismene at least thy [[choice]] was not made without my [[protest]].

antigone one [[world]] approved thy [[wisdom]]; another, mine. 

ismene howbeit, the offence is the same for both of us.

antigone be of [[good]] cheer; thou livest; but my [[life]] hath long been
given to [[death]], that so i might serve the [[dead]]. 

creon lo, one of these maidens hath newly shown herself foolish,
as the other hath been since her [[life]] began. 

ismene yea, o [[king]], such [[reason]] as [[nature]] may have given abides not
with the unfortunate, but goes astray. 

creon thine did, when thou chosest vile deeds with the vile.

ismene what [[life]] could i endure, without her presence? 

creon nay, speak not of her 'presence'; she lives [[life]] no more.

ismene but wilt thou slay the betrothed of thine own [[son]]?

creon nay, there are other fields for him to plough. 

ismene but there can never be such [[love]] as bound him to her.

creon i like not an [[evil]] [[wife]] for my [[son]]. 

antigone haemon, beloved! how thy [[father]] wrongs [[wrong]] thee! 

creon enough, enough of thee and of thy marriage! 

leader of the chorus wilt thou indeed rob thy [[son]] of this maiden?

creon 'tis [[death]] that shall stay these bridals for me. 

leader 'tis determined, it seems, that she shall [[die]]. 

creon determined, yes, for thee and for me.-  (to the two attendants)
no more delay-servants, take them within! henceforth they must be
women, and not range at large; for verily even the bold seek to fly,
when they see [[death]] now closing on their [[life]].  (exeunt attendants,
guarding antigone and ismene.-creon remains.)  

chorus  (singing, strophe 1)

blest are they whose days have not tasted of [[evil]]. for when a house
hath once been shaken from [[heaven]], there the curse fails nevermore,
passing from [[life]] to [[life]] of the [[race]]; even as, when the surge is
driven over the darkness of the deep by the fierce breath of thracian
sea-winds, it rolls up the black sand from the depths, and there is
sullen roar from wind-vexed headlands that front the blows of the
storm. 

(antistrophe 1)

i see that from olden [[time]] the sorrows [[sorrow]] in the house of the labdacidae
are heaped upon the sorrows [[sorrow]] of the [[dead]]; and [[generation]] is not freed
by [[generation]], but some [[god]] strikes them down, and the [[race]] hath no
deliverance. 

for now that [[hope]] of which the [[light]] had been spread above the last
root of the house of oedipus-that [[hope]], in turn, is brought low--by
the blood-stained dust due to the gods infernal, and by folly in [[speech]],
and frenzy at the [[heart]]. 

(strophe 2)

thy [[power]], o [[zeus]], what [[human]] trespass can limit? that [[power]] which
neither sleep, the all-ensnaring, nor the untiring months of the gods
can master; but thou, a ruler to whom [[time]] brings not old [[age]], dwellest
in the dazzling splendour of [[olympus]]. 

and through the future, near and far, as through the [[past]], shall this
law hold [[good]]: nothing that is vast enters into the [[life]] of mortals
without a curse. 

(antistrophe 2)

for that [[hope]] whose wanderings are so wide is to many [[men]] a comfort,
but to many a false lure of giddy desires [[desire]]; and the disappointment
comes on one who knoweth nought till he burn his foot against the
hot [[fire]]. 

for with [[wisdom]] hath some one given forth the famous saying, that
evil seems [[good]], soon or late, to him whose [[mind]] the [[god]] draws to
mischief; and but for the briefest space doth he fare [[free]] of woe.

leader of the chorus but lo, haemon, the [[last]] of thy sons [[son]];-comes
he grieving for the doom of his promised bride, antigone, and bitter
for the baffled [[hope]] of his [[marriage]]?  (enter haemon)  

creon we shall [[know]] soon, [[better]] than seers could tell us.-my [[son]],
hearing the fixed doom of thy betrothed, art [[arts]] thou come in rage against
thy [[father]]? or have i thy [[good]] will, act how i may? 

haemon [[father]], i am thine; and thou, in thy [[wisdom]], tracest for me
rules which i shall [[follow]]. no [[marriage]] shall be deemed by me a greater
gain than thy [[good]] guidance. 

creon yea, this, my [[son]], should be thy heart's fixed [[law]],-in all
things to obey thy father's will. 'tis for this that [[men]] [[pray]] to see
dutiful [[children]] grow up around them in their homes [[home]],-that such may
requite their father's foe with [[evil]], and [[honour]], as their father
doth, his friend. but he who begets unprofitable children-what shall
we say that he hath sown, but troubles for himself, and much triumph
for his foes? then do not thou, my [[son]], at pleasure's beck, dethrone
thy [[reason]] for a woman's sake; knowing that this is a joy that soon
grows cold in clasping arms,-an [[evil]] woman to share thy bed and thy
home. for what wound could strike deeper than a false friend? nay,
with loathing, and as if she were thine [[enemy]], let this girl go to
find a husband in the house of [[hades]]. for since i have taken her,
alone of all the [[city]], in open disobedience, i will not make myself
a liar to my people-i will slay her. 

so let her appeal as she will to the majesty of kindred [[blood]]. if
i am to nurture mine own kindred in naughtiness, needs must i bear
with it in aliens. he who does his [[duty]] in his own household will
be found righteous in the [[state]] also. but if any one transgresses,
and does [[violence]] to the laws [[law]], or thinks [[think]] to dictate to his rulers,
such an one can [[win]] no [[praise]] from me. no, whomsoever the [[city]] may
appoint, that [[man]] must be obeyed, in little things and [[great]], in just
things and [[unjust]]; and i should [[feel]] sure that one who thus obeys
would be a [[good]] ruler no less than a [[good]] [[subject]], and in the storm
of spears would stand his ground where he was set, [[loyal]] and dauntless
at his comrade's side. 

but disobedience is the worst of evils [[evil]]. this it is that ruins cities [[city]];
this makes homes [[home]] desolate; by this, the ranks of allies are broken
into head-long rout; but, of the lives [[life]] whose course is [[fair]], the greater
part owes safety to [[obedience]]. therefore we must support the cause
of order, and in no [[wise]] suffer a woman to worst us. [[better]] to fall
from [[power]], if we must, by a man's [[man]] hand; then we should not be called
weaker than a woman. 

leader to us, unless our years have stolen our wit, thou seemest
to say wisely what thou sayest. 

haemon [[father]], the gods implant [[reason]] in [[men]], the highest of all
things that we call our own. not mine the skill-far from me be the
quest!-to say wherein thou speakest not aright; and yet another [[man]],
too, might have some useful [[thought]]. at least, it is my [[natural]] office
to watch, on thy behalf, all that [[men]] say, or do, or find to blame.
for the dread of thy frown forbids the citizen to speak such words
as would offend thine ear; but can hear these murmurs in the dark,
these moanings of the [[city]] for this maiden; 'no woman,' they say,
'ever merited her doom less,-none ever was to [[die]] so shamefully for
deeds so glorious as hers; who, when her own [[brother]] had fallen in
bloody strife, would not leave him unburied, to be devoured by carrion
dogs, or by any bird:-deserves not she the meed of golden [[honour]]?'

such is the darkling rumour that spreads in secret. for me, my [[father]],
no treasure is so precious as thy welfare. what, indeed, is a nobler
ornament for [[children]] than a prospering sire's [[fair]] fame, or for sire
than son's? wear not, then, one mood only in thyself; [[think]] not that
thy word, and thine alone, must be [[right]]. for if any [[man]] thinks [[think]] that
he alone is [[wise]],-that in [[speech]], or in [[mind]], he hath no peer,-such
a [[soul]], when laid open, is ever found empty. 

no, though a [[man]] be [[wise]], 'tis no shame for him to learn many things,
and to bend in season. seest thou, beside the wintry torrent's course,
how the trees that yield to it save every twig, while the stiff-necked
perish root and branch? and even thus he who keeps the sheet of his
sail taut, and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and finishes his
voyage with keel uppermost. 

nay, forego thy wrath; permit thyself to [[change]]. for if i, a younger
man, may offer my [[thought]], it were far [[best]], i ween, that [[men]] should
be all-wise by [[nature]]; but, otherwise-and oft the scale inclines not
so-'tis [[good]] also to learn from those who speak aright. 

leader sire, 'tis meet that thou shouldest [[profit]] by his words, if
he speaks aught in season, and thou, haemon, by thy father's; for
on both parts there hath been [[wise]] [[speech]]. 

creon [[men]] of my [[age]] are we indeed to be schooled, then, by [[men]] of
his? 

haemon in nothing that is not [[right]]; but if i am [[young]], thou shouldest
look to my merits [[merit]], not to my years. 

creon is it a [[merit]] to [[honour]] the unruly? 

haemon i could [[wish]] no one to show [[respect]] for evil-doers.

creon then is not she tainted with that malady? 

haemon our theban folk, with one voice, denies it. 

creon shall thebes prescribe to me how i must [[rule]]? 

haemon see, there thou hast spoken like a [[youth]] indeed.

creon am i to [[rule]] this [[land]] by other [[judgment]] than mine own?

haemon that is no [[city]] which belongs to one [[man]]. 

creon is not the [[city]] held to be the ruler's? 

haemon thou wouldst make a [[good]] monarch of a desert. 

creon this boy, it seems, is the woman's champion. 

haemon if thou art [[arts]] a woman; indeed, my [[care]] is for thee.

creon shameless, at open feud with thy father! 

haemon nay, i see thee offending against [[justice]]. 

creon do i offend, when i [[respect]] mine own prerogatives?

haemon thou dost not [[respect]] them, when thou tramplest on the gods'
honours, 

creon o dastard [[nature]], yielding place to woman! 

haemon thou wilt never find me yield to baseness. 

creon all thy words, at least, plead for that girl. 

haemon and for thee, and for me, and for the gods below.

creon thou canst never [[marry]] her, on this side the grave.

haemon then she must [[die]], and in [[death]] [[destroy]] another.

creon how! doth thy boldness run to open threats? 

haemon what threat is it, to combat [[vain]] resolves? 

creon thou shalt rue thy witless teaching of [[wisdom]]. 

haemon wert thou not my [[father]], i would have called thee unwise.

creon thou woman's [[slave]], use not wheedling [[speech]] with me.

haemon thou wouldest speak, and then hear no reply? 

creon sayest thou so? now, by the [[heaven]] above us-be sure of it-thou
shalt smart for taunting me in this opprobrious strain. bring forth
that hated thing, that she may [[die]] forthwith in his presence-before
his eyes-at her bridegroom's side! 

haemon no, not at my side-never [[think]] it-shall she perish; nor shalt
thou ever set [[eyes]] more upon my face:-rave, then, with such friends
as can endure thee.  (exit haemon)  

leader the [[man]] is gone, o [[king]], in angry haste; a youthful [[mind]],
when stung, is fierce. 

creon let him do, or [[dream]], more than man-good speed to him!-but
he shall not save these two girls from their doom. 

leader dost thou indeed [[purpose]] to slay both? 

creon not her whose hands are pure: thou sayest well. 

leader and by what doom mean'st thou to slay the other?

creon i will take her where the path is loneliest, and hide her,
living, in rocky vault, with so much food set forth as piety prescribes,
that the [[city]] may avoid a [[public]] stain. and there, praying to [[hades]],
the only [[god]] whom she worships, perchance she will obtain release
from [[death]]; or else will learn, at [[last]], though late, that it is lost
labour to revere the [[dead]].  (creon goes into the palace.)

chorus  (singing, strophe)

love, unconquered in the [[fight]], [[love]], who makest havoc of [[wealth]],
who keepest thy vigil on the soft cheek of a maiden; thou roamest
over the sea, and among the homes [[home]] of dwellers in the wilds; no immortal
can escape thee, nor any among [[men]] whose [[life]] is for a day; and he
to whom thou hast come is mad. 

(antistrophe)

the just themselves have their minds [[mind]] warped by thee to [[wrong]], for
their ruin: 'tis thou that hast stirred up this [[present]] strife of
kinsmen; victorious is the love-kindling [[light]] from the [[eyes]] of the
fair bride; it is a [[power]] enthroned in sway beside the eternal laws [[law]];
for there the [[goddess]] aphrodite is working her unconquerable will.
(antigone is [[led]] out of the palace by two of creon's attendants who
are about to conduct her to her doom.)  but now i also am carried
beyond the bounds of loyalty, and can no more keep back the streaming
tears, when i see antigone thus passing to the bridal chamber where
all are laid to rest.  (the following lines between antigone and the
chorus are chanted responsively.)  

antigone (strophe 1)

see me, [[citizens]] of my fatherland, setting forth on my [[last]] way,
looking my [[last]] on the sunlight that is for me no more; no, hades
who gives sleep to all leads me living to acheron's shore; who have
had no portion in the chant that brings the bride, nor hath any song
been mine for the crowning of bridals; whom the [[lord]] of the dark lake
shall wed. 

chorus (systema 1)

glorious, therefore, and with [[praise]], thou departest to that deep
place of the [[dead]]: wasting sickness hath not smitten thee; thou hast
not found the wages of the [[sword]]; no, mistress of thine own [[fate]],
and still alive, thou shalt pass to [[hades]], as no other of mortal kind
hath passed. 

antigone (antistrophe 1)

i have heard in other days how dread a doom befell our phrygian guest,
the [[daughter]] of tantalus, on the sipylian heights; i how, like clinging
ivy, the [[growth]] of stone subdued her; and the rains fail not, as men
tell, from her wasting form, nor fails the snow, while beneath her
weeping lids the tears bedew her bosom; and most like to hers is the
fate that brings me to my rest. 

chorus (systema 2)

yet she was a [[goddess]], thou knowest, and born of gods; we are mortals,
and of mortal [[race]]. but 'tis [[great]] renown for a woman who hath perished
that she should have shared the doom of the godlike, in her [[life]],
and afterward in [[death]]. 

antigone (strophe 2)

ah, i am mocked! in the name of our fathers' gods, can ye not wait
till i am gone,-must ye taunt me to my face, o my [[city]], and ye, her
wealthy sons [[son]]? ah, fount of dirce, and thou holy ground of thebe whose
chariots are many; ye, at least, will bear me witness, in what sort,
unwept of [[friends]], and by what laws [[law]] i pass to the rock-closed prison
of my [[strange]] tomb, ah me unhappy! who have no [[home]] on the [[earth]] or
in the shades, no [[home]] with the living or with the [[dead]].

chorus (strophe 3)

thou hast rushed forward to the utmost verge of daring; and against
that [[throne]] where [[justice]] sits on high thou hast fallen, my [[daughter]],
with a grievous fall. but in this ordeal thou art [[arts]] paying, haply, for
thy father's [[sin]]. 

antigone (antistrophe 2)

thou hast touched on my bitterest [[thought]],-awaking the ever-new lament
for my sire and for all the doom given to us, the famed house of labdacus.
alas for the horrors of the mother's bed! alas for the wretched mother's
slumber at the side of her own [[son]],-and my sire! from what manner
of parents did i take my miserable being! and to them i go thus, accursed,
unwed, to share their [[home]]. alas, my [[brother]], ill-starred in thy [[marriage]],
in thy [[death]] thou hast undone my life! 

chorus (antistrophe 3)

reverent action claims a [[certain]] [[praise]] for reverence; but an offence
against [[power]] cannot be brooked by him who hath [[power]] in his keeping.
thy self-willed temper hath wrought thy ruin. 

antigone (epode)

unwept, unfriended, without marriage-song, i am [[led]] forth in my sorrow
on this [[journey]] that can be delayed no more. no longer, hapless one,
may i behold yon day-star's [[sacred]] eye; but for my [[fate]] no tear is
shed, no friend makes moan.  (creon enters from the palace.)

creon [[know]] ye not that songs [[song]] and wailings before [[death]] would never
cease, if it profited to utter them? away with her-away! and when
ye have enclosed her, according to my word, in her vaulted grave,
leave her alone, forlorn-whether she wishes [[wish]] to [[die]], or to [[live]] a buried
life in such a [[home]]. our hands are clean as touching this maiden.
but this is certain-she shall be deprived of her sojourn in the [[light]].

antigone tomb, bridal-chamber, eternal prison in the caverned rock,
whither go to find mine own, those many who have perished, and whom
persephone hath received among the dead! [[last]] of all shall i pass
thither, and far most miserably of all, before the term of my life
is spent. but i cherish [[good]] [[hope]] that my coming will be welcome to
my [[father]], and pleasant to thee, my [[mother]], and welcome, [[brother]],
to thee; for, when ye died, with mine own hands i washed and dressed
you, and poured drink-offerings at your graves; and now, polyneices,
'tis for tending thy corpse that i [[win]] such recompense as this.

and yet i honoured thee, as the [[wise]] will deem, rightly. never, had
been a [[mother]] of [[children]], or if a husband had been mouldering in
death, would i have taken this task upon me in the city's despite.
what [[law]], ye ask, is my warrant for that word? the husband lost, another
might have been found, and child from another, to replace the first-born:
but, [[father]] and [[mother]] hidden with [[hades]], no brother's [[life]] could
ever bloom for me again. such was the [[law]] whereby i held thee first
in [[honour]]; but creon deemed me guilty of error therein, and of outrage,
ah [[brother]] mine! and now he leads me thus, a captive in his hands;
no bridal bed, no bridal [[song]] hath been mine, no joy of [[marriage]],
no portion in the nurture of [[children]]; but thus, forlorn of [[friends]],
unhappy one, i go living to the vaults of [[death]]. 

and what [[law]] of [[heaven]] have i transgressed? why, hapless one, should
i look to the gods any more,-what ally should i invoke,-when by piety
i have earned the name of impious? nay, then, if these things are
pleasing to the gods, when i have [[suffered]] my doom, i shall come to
know my [[sin]]; but if the [[sin]] is with my judges [[judge]], i could [[wish]] them no
fuller measure of [[evil]] than they, on their part, mete wrongfully to
me. 

chorus still the same tempest of the [[soul]] vexes this maiden with
the same fierce gusts. 

creon then for this shall her guards have cause to rue their slowness.

antigone ah me! that word hath come very near to [[death]].

creon i can cheer thee with no [[hope]] that this doom is not thus to
be fulfilled. 

antigone o [[city]] of my fathers [[father]] in the [[land]] of thebe! o ye gods, eldest
of our race!-they lead me henc--now, now-they tarry not! behold me,
princes of thebes, the [[last]] [[daughter]] of the house of your kings [[king]],-see
what i suffer, and from whom, because i feared to cast away the fear
of heaven!  (antigone is [[led]] away by the guards.)  

chorus  (singing, strophe 1)

even thus endured danae in her [[beauty]] to [[change]] the [[light]] of day
for brass-bound walls; and in that chamber, secret as the grave, she
was held close [[prisoner]]; yet was she of a proud lineage, o my [[daughter]],
and charged with the keeping of the seed of [[zeus]], that fell in the
golden rain. 

but dreadful is the mysterious [[power]] of [[fate]]: there is no deliverance
from it by [[wealth]] or by [[war]], by fenced [[city]], or dark, sea-beaten ships.

(antistrophe 1)

and bonds tamed the [[son]] of dryas, swift to wrath, that [[king]] of the
edonians; so paid he for his frenzied taunts, when, by the will of
dionysus, he was pent in a rocky prison. there the fierce exuberance
of his madness slowly passed away. that [[man]] learned to [[know]] the [[god]],
whom in his frenzy he had provoked with mockeries; for he had sought
to quell the god-possessed [[women]], and the bacchanalian [[fire]]; and he
angered the muses that [[love]] the flute. 

(strophe 2)

and by the waters of the dark rocks, the waters of the twofold sea,
are the shores of bosporus, and thracian salmydessus; where ares,
neighbour to the [[city]], saw the accurst, blinding wound dealt to the
two sons [[son]] of phineus by his fierce [[wife]],-the wound that brought darkness
to those vengeance-craving orbs, smitten with her bloody hands, smitten
with her shuttle for a dagger. 

(antistrophe 2)

pining in their misery, they bewailed their cruel doom, those sons
of a [[mother]] hapless in her [[marriage]]; but she traced her descent from
the ancient line of the erechtheidae; and in far-distant caves she
was nursed amid her father's storms, that child of boreas, swift as
a steed over the steep hills, a [[daughter]] of gods; yet upon her also
the gray fates [[fate]] bore hard, my [[daughter]].  (enter teiresias, [[led]] by a
boy, on the spectators' [[right]].)  

teiresias princes [[prince]] of thebes, we have come with linked steps, both
served by the [[eyes]] of one; for thus, by a guide's [[help]], the blind
must walk. 

creon and what, aged teiresias, are thy tidings? 

teiresias i will tell thee; and do thou hearken to the seer.

creon indeed, it has not been my wont to slight thy counsel.

teiresias therefore didst thou steer our city's course aright.

creon i have [[felt]], and can attest, thy benefits. 

teiresias mark that now, once more, thou standest on fate's fine
edge. 

creon what means this? how i shudder at thy message! 

teiresias thou wilt learn, when thou hearest the warnings of mine
art. as i took my place on mine old seat of augury, where all birds
have been wont to gather within my ken, i heard a [[strange]] voice among
them; they were screaming with dire, feverish rage, that drowned their
language in jargon; and i knew that they were rending each other with
their talons, murderously; the whirr of wings told no doubtful tale.

forthwith, in [[fear]], i essayed burnt-sacrifice on a duly kindled altar:
but from my offerings the fire-god showed no flame; a dank moisture,
oozing from the thigh-flesh, trickled forth upon the embers, and smoked,
and sputtered; the gall was scattered to the air; and the streaming
thighs lay bared of the fat that had been wrapped round them.

such was the failure of the rites by which i vainly [[asked]] a sign,
as from this boy i learned; for he is my guide, as i am guide to others.
and 'tis thy counsel that hath brought this sickness on our [[state]].
for the altars of our [[city]] and of our hearths have been tainted, one
and all, by birds and dogs, with carrion from the hapless corpse,
the [[son]] of oedipus: and therefore the gods no more accept prayer and
sacrifice at our hands, or the flame of meat-offering; nor doth any
bird give a clear sign by its shrill cry, for they have tasted the
fatness of a slain man's [[man]] [[blood]]. 

think, then, on these things, my [[son]]. all [[men]] are liable to err; but
when an error hath been made, that [[man]] is no longer witless or unblest
who heals the ill into which he hath fallen, and remains not stubborn.

self-will, we [[know]], incurs the charge of folly. nay, allow the claim
of the [[dead]]; stab not the fallen; what prowess is it to slay the slain
anew? i have sought thy [[good]], and for thy [[good]] i speak: and never
is it sweeter to learn from a [[good]] counsellor than when he counsels
for thine own gain. 

creon old [[man]], ye all shoot your shafts at me, as archers at the
butts;-ye must needs practise on me with seer-craft also;-aye, the
seer-tribe hath long trafficked in me, and made me their merchandise.
gain your gains, drive your [[trade]], if ye list, in the silver-gold
of sardis and the gold of [[india]]; but ye shall not hide that [[man]] in
the grave,-no, though the eagles of [[zeus]] should bear the carrion morsels
to their master's throne-no, not for dread of that defilement will
i suffer his burial:-for well i [[know]] that no mortal can defile the
gods.-but, aged teiresias, the wisest fall with shameful fall, when
they clothe shameful thoughts [[thought]] in [[fair]] words, for lucre's sake.

teiresias alas! doth any [[man]] [[know]], doth any consider...

creon whereof? what general [[truth]] dost thou announce? 

teiresias how precious, above all [[wealth]], is [[good]] counsel.

creon as folly, i [[think]], is the worst mischief. 

teiresias yet thou art [[arts]] tainted with that distemper. 

creon i would not [[answer]] the seer with a taunt. 

teiresias but thou dost, in saying that i [[prophesy]] falsely.

creon well, the prophet-tribe was ever fond of [[money]]. 

teiresias and the [[race]] bred of tyrants [[tyrant]] loves [[love]] base gain.

creon knowest thou that thy [[speech]] is spoken of thy [[king]]?

teiresias i [[know]] it; for through me thou hast saved thebes.

creon thou art [[arts]] a [[wise]] seer; but thou lovest [[evil]] deeds.

teiresias thou wilt rouse me to utter the dread secret in my [[soul]].

creon out with it!-only speak it not for gain. 

teiresias indeed, methinks, i shall not,-as touching thee.

creon [[know]] that thou shalt not [[trade]] on my resolve. 

teiresias then [[know]] thou-aye, [[know]] it well-that thou shalt not live
through many more courses of the sun's swift chariot, ere one begotten
of thine own loins shall have been given by thee, a corpse for corpses;
because thou hast thrust [[children]] of the sunlight to the shades, and
ruthlessly lodged a living [[soul]] in the grave; but keepest in this
world one who belongs to the gods infernal, a corpse unburied, unhonoured,
all unhallowed. in such thou hast no part, nor have the gods above,
but this is a [[violence]] done to them by thee. therefore the avenging
destroyers [[lie]] in wait for thee, the furies of [[hades]] and of the gods,
that thou mayest be taken in these same ills. 

and mark well if i speak these things as a hireling. a [[time]] not long
to be delayed shall awaken the wailing of [[men]] and of [[women]] in thy
house. and a tumult of [[hatred]] against thee stirs all the cities [[city]] whose
mangled sons [[son]] had the burial-rite from dogs, or from wild beasts, or
from some winged bird that bore a polluting breath to each [[city]] that
contains the hearths of the [[dead]]. 

such arrows for thy heart-since thou provokest me-have i launched
at thee, archer-like, in my anger,-sure arrows, of which thou shalt
not escape the smart.-boy, lead me [[home]], that he may spend his rage
on younger [[men]], and learn to keep a tongue more temperate, and to
bear within his breast a [[better]] [[mind]] than now he bears.  (the boy
leads teiresias out.)  

leader of the chorus the [[man]] hath gone, o [[king]], with dread prophecies.
and, since the hair on this head, once dark, hath been [[white]], i know
that he hath never been a false [[prophet]] to our [[city]]. 

creon i, too, [[know]] it well, and am troubled in [[soul]]. 'tis dire to
yield; but, by [[resistance]], to smite my [[pride]] with ruin-this, too,
is a dire [[choice]]. 

leader [[son]] of menoeceus, it behoves thee to take [[wise]] counsel.

creon what should i do then? speak and i will obey. 

leader go thou, and [[free]] the maiden from her rocky chamber, and make
a tomb for the unburied [[dead]]. 

creon and this is thy counsel? thou wouldst have me yield?

leader yea, [[king]], and with all speed; for swift harms from the gods
cut short the folly of [[men]]. 

creon ah me, 'tis hard, but i resign my cherished resolve,-i obey.
we must not wage a [[vain]] [[war]] with [[destiny]]. 

leader go, thou, and do these things; leave them not to others.

creon even as i am i'll go:-on, on, my servants, each and all of
you,-take axes in your hands, and hasten to the ground that ye see
yonder! since our [[judgment]] hath taken this turn, i will be present
to unloose her, as myself bound her. my [[heart]] misgives me, 'tis best
to keep the established laws [[law]], even to life's end.  (creon and his
servants hasten out on the spectators' left.)  

chorus  (singing, strophe 1)

o thou of many names, [[glory]] of the cadmeian bride, offspring of loud-thundering
zeus! thou who watchest over famed italia, and reignest, where all
guests are welcomed, in the sheltered plain of eleusinian deo! o bacchus,
dweller in thebe, mother-city of bacchants, by the softly-gliding
stream of ismenus, on the soil where the fierce dragon's teeth were
sown! 

(antistrophe 1)

thou hast been seen where torch-flames glare through smoke, above
the crests of the twin peaks, where move the corycian nymphs [[nymph]], thy
votaries, hard by castalia's stream. 

thou comest from the ivy-mantled slopes of nysa's hills, and from
the shore green with many-clustered vines, while thy name is lifted
up on strains of more than mortal [[power]], as thou visitest the ways
of thebe: 

(strophe 2)

thebe, of all cities [[city]], thou holdest first in [[honour]], thou and thy
mother whom the lightning smote; and now, when all our [[people]] is captive
to a [[violent]] plague, come thou with healing feet over the parnassian
height, or over the moaning strait! 

(antistrophe 2)

o thou with whom the stars rejoice as they move, the stars whose
breath is [[fire]]; o master of the voices of the night; [[son]] begotten
of [[zeus]]; appear, o [[king]], with thine attendant thyiads, who in night-long
frenzy dance before thee, the giver of [[good]] gifts, iacchus!  (enter
messenger, on the spectators' left.)  

messenger dwellers by the house of cadmus and of amphion, there is
no estate of mortal [[life]] that i would ever [[praise]] or blame as settled.
fortune raises and [[fortune]] humbles the lucky or unlucky from day to
day, and no one can [[prophesy]] to [[men]] concerning those things which
are established. for 

creon was blest once, as i count bliss; he had saved this [[land]] of
cadmus from its foes; he was clothed with sole dominion in the [[land]];
he reigned, the glorious sire of princely [[children]]. and now all hath
been lost. for when a [[man]] hath forfeited his pleasures [[pleasure]], i count him
not as living,-i hold him but a breathing corpse. heap up riches [[rich]] in
thy house, if thou wilt; [[live]] in kingly [[state]]; yet, if there be no
gladness therewith, i would not give the shadow of a vapour for all
the rest, compared with joy. 

leader of the chorus and what is this new [[grief]] that thou hast to
tell for our princes [[prince]]? 

messenger [[death]]; and the living are guilty for the [[dead]].

leader and who is the slayer? who the stricken? speak. 

messenger haemon hath perished; his [[blood]] hath been shed by no stranger.

leader by his father's hand, or by his own? 

messenger by his own, in wrath with his sire for the murder.

leader o [[prophet]], how true, then, hast thou proved thy word!

messenger these things stand thus; ye must consider of the rest.

leader lo, i see the hapless eurydice, creon's [[wife]], approaching;
she comes from the house by [[chance]], haply,-or because she knows [[know]] the
tidings of her [[son]].  (enter eurydice from the palace.)  

eurydice [[people]] of thebes, i heard your words as i was going forth,
to salute the [[goddess]] pallas with my prayers. even as i was loosing
the fastenings of the gate, to open it, the message of a household
woe smote on mine ear: i sank back, terror-stricken, into the arms
of my handmaids, and my senses fled. but say again what the tidings
were; i shall hear them as one who is no stranger to [[sorrow]].

messenger dear [[lady]], i will witness of what i saw, and will leave
no word of the [[truth]] untold. why, indeed, should i soothe thee with
words in which must presently be found false? [[truth]] is ever [[best]].-i
attended thy [[lord]] as his guide to the furthest part of the plain,
where the [[body]] of polyneices, torn by dogs, still lay unpitied. we
prayed the [[goddess]] of the roads, and pluto, in [[mercy]] to restrain their
wrath; we washed the [[dead]] with holy washing; and with freshly-plucked
boughs we solemnly burned such relics as there were. we raised a high
mound of his native [[earth]]; and then we turned away to enter the maiden's
nuptial chamber with rocky couch, the caverned mansion of the bride
of [[death]]. and, from afar off, one of us heard a voice of loud wailing
at that bride's unhallowed bower; and came to tell our master creon.

and as the [[king]] drew nearer, doubtful sounds of a bitter cry floated
around him; he groaned, and said in accents of anguish, 'wretched
that i am, can my foreboding be true? am i going on the wofullest
way that ever i went? my son's voice greets me.-go, my servants,-haste
ye nearer, and when ye have reached the tomb, pass through the gap,
where the stones have been wrenched away, to the cell's very mouth,-and
look. and see if 'tis haemon's voice that i [[know]], or if mine ear is
cheated by the gods.' 

this search, at our despairing master's word, we went to make; and
in the furthest part of the tomb we descried her hanging by the neck,
slung by a thread-wrought halter of fine linen: while he was embracing
her with arms thrown around her waist, bewailing the loss of his bride
who is with the [[dead]], and his father's deeds, and his own ill-starred
love. 

but his [[father]], when he saw him, cried aloud with a dread cry and
went in, and called to him with a voice of wailing:-'unhappy, what
deed hast thou done! what [[thought]] hath come to thee? what manner of
mischance hath marred thy [[reason]]? come forth, my child! i [[pray]] thee-i
implore!' but the boy glared at him with fierce [[eyes]], spat in his
face, and, without a word of [[answer]], drew his cross-hilted [[sword]]:-as
his [[father]] rushed forth in flight, he missed his aim;-then, hapless
one, wroth with himself, he straightway leaned with all his weight
against his [[sword]], and drove it, half its length, into his side; and,
while sense lingered, he clasped the maiden to his faint embrace,
and, as he gasped, sent forth on her pale cheek the swift stream of
the oozing [[blood]]. 

corpse enfolding corpse he lies [[lie]]; he hath won his nuptial rites, poor
youth, not here, yet in the halls of [[death]]; and he hath witnessed
to [[mankind]] that, of all curses which cleave to [[man]], ill counsel is
the [[sovereign]] curse.  (eurydice retires into the house.)

leader what wouldst thou augur from this? the [[lady]] hath turned back,
and is gone, without a word, [[good]] or [[evil]]. 

messenger i, too, am startled; yet i nourish the [[hope]] that, at these
sore tidings of her [[son]], she cannot deign to give her [[sorrow]] public
vent, but in the privacy of the house will set her handmaids to mourn
the household [[grief]]. for she is not untaught of discretion, that she
should err. 

leader i [[know]] not; but to me, at least, a strained [[silence]] seems
to portend peril, no less than [[vain]] abundance of lament.

messenger well, i will enter the house, and learn whether indeed
she is not hiding some repressed [[purpose]] in the depths of a passionate
heart. yea, thou sayest well: excess of [[silence]], too, may have a perilous
meaning.  (the messenger goes into the palace. enter creon, on the
spectators' left, with attendants, carrying the shrouded [[body]] of haemon
on bier. the following lines between creon and the chorus are chanted
responsively.)  

chorus lo, yonder the [[king]] himself draws near, bearing that which
tells too clear a tale,-the [[work]] of no stranger's madness,-if we may
say it,-but of his own misdeeds. 

creon (strophe 1)

woe for the sins [[sin]] of a darkened [[soul]], stubborn sins [[sin]], fraught with
death! ah, ye behold us, the sire who hath slain, the [[son]] who hath
perished! woe is me, for the wretched blindness of my counsels! alas,
my [[son]], thou hast died in thy [[youth]], by a timeless doom, woe is me!-thy
spirit hath fled,-not by thy folly, but by mine own! 

chorus (strophe 2)

ah me, how all too late thou seemest to see the right! 
creon ah me, i have learned the bitter lesson! but then, methinks,
oh then, some [[god]] smote me from above with crushing weight, and hurled
me into ways of [[cruelty]], woe is me,-overthrowing and trampling on
my joy! woe, woe, for the troublous toils of men!  (enter messenger
from the house.)  

messenger sire, thou hast come, methinks, as one whose hands are
not empty, but who hath store laid up besides; thou bearest yonder
burden with thee-and thou art [[arts]] soon to look upon the woes within thy
house. 

creon and what worse ill is yet to [[follow]] upon ills? 

messenger thy queen hath died, true [[mother]] of yon corpse-ah, hapless
lady by blows newly dealt. 

creon (antistrophe 1)

oh [[hades]], all-receiving whom no [[sacrifice]] can appease! hast thou,
then, no [[mercy]] for me? o thou herald of [[evil]], bitter tidings, what
word dost thou utter? alas, i was already as [[dead]], and thou hast smitten
me anew! what sayest thou, my [[son]]? what is this new message that thou
bringest-woe, woe is me!-of a wife's doom-of slaughter headed on slaughter?

chorus thou canst behold: 'tis no longer hidden within.  (the doors
of the palace are opened, and the corpse of eurydice is disclosed.)

creon (antistrophe 2)

ah me,-yonder i behold a new, a second woe! what [[destiny]], ah what,
can yet await me? i have but now raised my [[son]] in my arms,-and there,
again, i see a corpse before me! alas, alas, unhappy mother! alas,
my child! 

messenger there, at the altar, self-stabbed with a keen knife, she
suffered her darkening [[eyes]] to close, when she had wailed for the
noble [[fate]] of megareus who died before, and then for his [[fate]] who
lies there,-and when, with her [[last]] breath, she had invoked [[evil]] fortunes
upon thee, the slayer of thy sons [[son]]. 

creon (strophe 3)

woe, woe! i thrill with dread. is there none to strike me to the
heart with two-edged [[sword]]?-o miserable that i am, and steeped in
miserable anguish! 

messenger yea, both this son's doom, and that other's, were laid
to thy charge by her whose corpse thou seest. 

creon and what was the manner of the [[violent]] deed by which she passed
away? 

messenger her own hand struck her to the [[heart]], when she had learned
her son's sorely lamented [[fate]]. 

creon (strophe 4)

ah me, this guilt can never be fixed on any other of mortal [[kind]],
for my acquittal! i, even i, was thy slayer, wretched that i am-i
own the [[truth]]. lead me away, o my servants, lead me hence with all
speed, whose [[life]] is but as death! 

chorus thy counsels are [[good]], if there can be [[good]] with ills; briefest
is [[best]], when trouble is in our path. 

creon (antistrophe 3)

oh, let it come, let it appear, that fairest of fates [[fate]] for me, that
brings my [[last]] day,-aye, [[best]] [[fate]] of all! oh, let it come, that i
may never look upon to-morrow's [[light]]. 

chorus these things are in the future; [[present]] tasks claim our [[care]]:
the ordering of the future rests where it should rest. 

creon all my desires [[desire]], at least, were summed in that prayer.

chorus [[pray]] thou no more; for mortals have no escape from destined
woe. 

creon (antistrophe 4)

lead me away, i [[pray]] you; a rash, foolish [[man]]; who have slain thee,
ah my [[son]], unwittingly, and thee, too, my wife-unhappy that i am!
i [[know]] not which way i should bend my gaze, or where i should seek
support; for all is amiss with that which is in my hands,-and yonder,
again, a crushing [[fate]] hath leapt upon my head.  (as creon is being
conducted into the palace, the leader of the chorus speaks the closing
verses.)  

leader [[wisdom]] is the supreme part of [[happiness]]; and reverence towards
the gods must be inviolate. [[great]] words of prideful [[men]] are ever punished
with [[great]] blows, and, in old [[age]], [[teach]] the chastened to be [[wise]].

the end
