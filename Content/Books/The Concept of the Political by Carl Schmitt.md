carl schmitt



carl schmitt was a prominent legal scholar  in  post—world [[war]] i germany and one of the leading intellectuals during the weimar period. exceptionally active as a teacher and publicist, he probed the [[nature]] and sources of what he took to be the weakness of the moclern  liberal,  parliamentary  [[state]],  both  in  its  embodiment in  the  weimar  [[constitution]]  and   more  broadly  as  the  [[modern]]  form
of  [[political]]  organization.   he   joined   the   nazi  party  in   i933   (in
may,  the  same  month  as  did  martin  heidegger)  and published

several works [[work]], some of them anti-semitic, in which he explicitly defended the policies of the regime. (he would later claim that he was trying to give his own understanding  of nazi  ideas [[idea]].)*  ir 1936 he was severely criticized in articles published in das schwarze ko-rps, an official ss organ. protected by herman goring, he re- mained in his post at the [[university]] of berlin and  continued  teach- ing and writing but with a much reduced locus on contemporary domestic  cerman  matters.  he  was  detained  for  an eighteen-month
period after the [[war]] by allied authorities [[authority]], but never  formally  charged with crimes. he never resumed a [[university]] position. fest- schriften were published on the occasions [[occasion]] of his seventieth and eightieth birthdays; among the authors contributing were julien freund,  reinhart koselleck,  and   karlfried   gr under.  he  died   in i qs$ at the [[age]] of ninety-six.
from the beginning of his [[career]], schmitt was taken  seri- ously on all parts of the [[political]] spectrum. the [[young]] carl friedrich (later to become a central author of the postwar [[german]] [[constitution]],  a  harvard   professor,  and   president  of  the american
political [[science]] association) cited him approvingly, in i 93o, on article  48  of  the  weimar  [[constitution]],   which  permitted  commis-
sarial dictatorship, a step that schmitt had urged on hindenberg.’ franz neumann, the socialist and left-wing sociologist author of behemoth, drew extensively upon schmitt, as did his colleague and  friend  otto kirchheimer.’  indeed, all of the  frankfurt school

(especially walter benjamin) spoke highly of him, often after i 933. more  recently, the  italian  and  french  left, as well as those  associ-
ated with the radical jour na1 telos, have  approvingly  investigated his nonideological conception of  the  [[political]].‘  the  [[european]] [[right]], as well as american conservatives of a straussian persuasion, find in his [[work]] at least  the  beginnings  of  a  theory  of  [[authority]] that might address the supposed failings of  individualistic  liberal- ism. just as interestingly, a number of defenders of liberalism have found   it  necessary  to  [[single]]  out  schmitt  for  attack,’  a  need they

do not [[feel]] with other critics of liberal parliamentarism who were members of the nazi party. by [[virtue]] of the range of those to whom he appeals and the depth of his [[political]] allegiance during the nazi era, schmitt comes close these days to being the martin heidegger of [[political]] theory.8
i cannot here do more than to call attention to these facts [[fact]].9 if a deﬁnition of an important thinker is to have a manifold of supporters and detractors,10 the scholars i have cited clearly show schmitt a thinker to be taken seriously.  this is new.  entries in   a standard reference [[work]], the blackwell encyclopedia of politi- cal [[thought]], published in 1987, go from “schiller, friedrich” to “schumpeter, joseph.” no carl schmitt. yet recent years have seen an explosion of [[work]] on schmitt, in english-speaking countries [[country]] as well as in germany.11 a [[question]] thus accompanies the welcome

sympathetic, chantal mouffe ﬁnds him “an adversary as rigorous as he is insight- ful,” in “penser la démocratie moderne avec, et contre, carl schmitt,” revue française de [[science]] politique 42, no. 1 (february 1992), p. 83. a computer search of the holdings of a research [[university]] library on schmitt comes up with sixty-three journal articles in the [[last]] ﬁve years as well as thirty-six books [[book]] published since 1980, most of them since 1990. by comparison, the search reveals 164 articles on heidegger, and twenty-six on hitler.
8 around the [[time]] they both joined the nazi party, schmitt initiated
contact with heidegger by sending him a copy of the concept of the [[political]]. hei- degger responded warmly and indicated that he hoped schmitt would assist him in “reconstituting the [[law]] faculty.” this  letter  appears  on  p.  132  of  the telos issue cited above. schmitt, heidegger, and bäumler were the three most prominent [[german]] intellectuals to join the party.

reissuing of schmitt’s the concept of the [[political]]. what is the significance of the rebirth of interest in schmitt, a leading conser va- tive jurist during the weimar [[republic]], a scholar severely compro- mised by his participation in  and  support  for  the  nazi  regime? why is he now a focus  for  contention?  what  do  we  learn  about our intellectual interests and problems in the attention  now  being paid to carl schmitt!
the intense and renewed attention to the [[work]]  of  carl schmitt, whether hostile or  favorable,  is  due  to  the  [[fact]]  that  he sits at the intersection of three central questions [[question]] which any contem- porary [[political]] theorist must consider. the first is the relation between liberalism and [[democracy]]. the second is the relation be- tween [[politics]] and ethics. the third is the importance  of  what schmitt called “enemies” for [[state]]  legitimation  and  the implication of that importance for the relation between domestic and interna- tional [[politics]]. his understandings of these questions [[question]] raise a final issue, which c{uietly frames all  of  the  others;  it  has  to  do  with  the [[nature]] and consequence of the growing distance between the contemporary [[world]]  and  the  events   associated   with   the  advent of nazism. i want here to examine each of the questions [[question]], both substantively and in terms of their interest and challenge to the various schools of  [[thought]]  that  take schmitt seriously.  i am going to call these schools “left,” “right,” and “liberal.” i do so with the recognition that these terms  may  be  outmoded  and  even  a  source of confusion in our [[world]].


the relation between liberalism and democracy
schmitt’s conception of the [[political]] stands  in  opposition  to his conception of “political romanticism,” the [[subject]] of one of his early books [[book]]. [[political]] romanticism is characterized as a stance of occasionalist ironism, such that there is no [[last]] word on anything. [[political]] romanticism is the doctrine of the autonomous, isolated,
xiv	tracy b. strong
and solitary [[individual]],  whose absolute  stance  toward  himself gives a [[world]] in which nothing is connecting to anything else. [[political]] romanticism is thus at the root of what schmitt sees as the liberal tendency to substitute perpetual  discussion  for  the  [[political]]."  on the positive side, schmitt’s conception of the [[political]] stands in [[alliance]] with the [[subject]] of his subsequent [[book]], [[politics]] 1 theology. there he elaborates a conception of sovereignty as the making of decisions which concern the exception."  the  [[political]]  is  the  arena of [[authority]] rather than general  [[law]]  and requires  decisions  which are singular, absolute and final.” thus, as schmitt notes in [[political]] theology, the [[sovereign]] decision has the quality of being something like a [[religious]] miracle: it  has no  references  except  the [[fact]]  that  it is, to what heidegger would have called its demin. (it  should  be noted that the [[sovereign]] is not like [[god]]: there i no “sovereign.” rather, [[sovereign]] acts have the quality of referring only to them- selves, as moments of “existential intervention.”)”
this is, for schmitt, a given quality of “the [[political]].” what distresses him is that the historical conjunction of liberalism and [[democracy]] has obscured this conception, such that we are in danger of losing the [[experience]] of the [[political]]. in 77ir concept of the [[political]] schmitt identifies this loss of the conception of the [[political]] with the triumph of the [[modern]] notion of [[politics]], dating loosely from the french [[revolution]] but already [[present]] in seventeenth- century doctrines such as those of cardinal bellarmine, whose theory of indirect powers [[power]] hobbes went to extended pains [[pain]] to attack in [[chapter]] 4 i of levlathan. [[politics]] thus involves, famously, friends

and enemies [[enemy]], which means at least the centrality of  those  who are with you and those against whom you struggle. fighting and the possibility of [[death]] are necessary for there to be the [[political]]."
from this standpoint, schmitt came to the following conclu- sions about [[modern]] bourgeois [[politics]]. first, it is  a  [[system]]  which rests on compromise; hence all of its solutions are in the end temporary, occasional, never decisive. second,  such  arrangements can never resolve the  claims  of  equality  inherent  in  [[democracy]].  by the universalism implicit in its claims for equality, [[democracy]] challenges the legitimacy of the [[political]] order, as liberal legitimacy rests on discuss ion and the compromise of shifting majority rules [[rule]]. third, liberalism will tend to undermine the possibility  of  the [[political]] in that it wishes [[wish]] to substitute procedure for struggle. th us, [[last]], legitimacy and legality  cannot  be the same; indeed,  they  stand in contradiction to each other."
the driving [[force]] behind this argument lies [[lie]] in its claim that [[politics]] cannot be made safe and that the attempt  to  make  [[politics]] safe will result in the abandonment of the [[state]]  to private  interests and to “society.” the reality of an empirical referent for this claim was undeniable in the [[experience]] of weimar. (it is worth remem- bering that  schmitt was  among  those  who  sought  to  strengthen the weimar regime by  trying  to  persuade  hindenburg  to  invoke the temporary dictatorial powers [[power]] of article 48 against the extremes
on the [[right]] and the left.)"
there is here, however, a deeper claim, a claim that the [[political]] defines what it is to be a  [[human]]  being  in  the  [[modern]] [[world]] and that those who would diminish the [[political]] diminish [[humanity]]. schmitt lays this out  as  the  “friend-enemy”  distinction. what  is  important  about  this distinction  is not sc›  much  the  “who

is on my side” quality, but the claim that only by means of this distinction does the [[question]] of our willingness to  take  responsi- bility for our own lives [[life]] arise. “each  participant  is  in  a  position  to [[judge]] whether  the  adversary   intends  to  negate  his  opponent’s   way of [[life]] and  therefore  must  be  repulsed  or fought in order to preserve
one’s  oon    form   of  rzirfenre.   ’9   i t  is   this  quality   that   attracts the
nonliberal left and the [[right]] to  schmitt.  it  is  precisely  to  deny that the stakes of [[politics]] should be so high that liberals resist  schmitt. lf a liberal is  a  [[person]]  who cannot  take  his  own  side  in an argument, a liberal is also a [[person]] who,  as  schmitt  notes, thereby raising the stakes, if [[asked]] “ ‘christ or barabbas?’ [re- sponds]   with   a   proposal   to  adjourn  or  appoint  a  committee   of
investigation. *0

the	relation between [[politics]] and ethics
schmitt claimed that liberalism’s reliance on procedure  [[led]] to a depoliticization and dehumanization of the [[world]]. it was the daring of the claim for  the [[political]]  that drew leo strauss’s  atten-
tion in the critique he wrote of the conrep/ off/te pofifirnf $£l i 932. schmitt  had  written:  “the  [[political]]  adversaries  of  a  clear political
theory will ... easily refute [[political]] phenomena and truths [[truth]]  in the name of some autonomous discipline as amoral, uneconomical, unscientific and above all declare this—and this is politically rele- vant—a [[devil]] ry worthy of being combated.” ’ schmitt’s claim  was not just that the [[political]] was a separate realm of [[human]] activity, parallel  to ethics, economics,  [[science]], and  [[religion]],  but  that inquiry

foreword	xvii
into the [[political]] was an inquiry into the “order of [[human]] things,” where the important word is “human.””
to claim this was to claim that the possibility of dying for what one was was the final determining quality of the [[human]]. schmitt’s existential hobbesianism thus saw [[moral]] claims as im- plicitly denying the finality of [[death]] in favor of an abstract univer- salism in which [[human]] beings were not particularly involved in what they were. as herbert marcuse noted, “carl schmitt inquires into the [[reason]] for such [[sacrifice]]: ‘there is no [[rational]] end, no norm however [[correct]], no program however exemplary, no social ideal however beautiful, and no legitimacy or legality that could justify [[men’s]] killing one another.’ what, then, remains as a possible justification! only this: that there is a [[state]] of affairs that through its very existence and presence is exempt from all justification, i.e. an ‘existential,’ ‘ontological’ [[state]] of affairs,—justification by mere existence.”” it is this quality in schmitt that is at the basis of the accusations of irrationalism and decisionism.”
two questions [[question]] are at stake here. the first is whether it is possible to escape the hold of an ethical universalism;  the second  is that if it is possible, where then does one find oneself what does it mean to go “beyond [[good]] and evil” ! schmitt clearly [[thought]] that he had given a positive [[answer]] to the first [[question]]: that  [[people]] will only be responsible for what they are if the  reality of [[death]]  and  conflict  remain  [[present]].2’  such considerations transcend  the

ethical and place one—this is schmitt’s [[answer]] to the second ques- tion—in the realm of [[nature]]. as strauss  notes:  “schmitt  returns, contrary to liberalism, to its  author,  hobbes,  in  order  to  strike  at the root of liberalism in hobbes’s express negation  of  the  [[state]]  of [[nature]]. 2‘
however, as strauss brilliantly shows, it is highly contestable that schmitt actually has achieved what he believes [[belief]] himself to have accomplished. strauss demonstrates that schmitt  remains  con- cerned with the meaningfulness of life—he is afraid that modernity will make [[life]] unmeaningful. he thus, as strauss concludes, re- mains within the horizon of  liberal  moralist.  “the  affirmation  of the [[political]],”  writes  strauss,  “is  ultimately   nothing  other   than the affirmation of the [[moral]].”*’ schmitt has, albeit un willingly, moralized even his would-be amorality.
it is out of the scope of this foreword to indicate how schmitt might have  done  otherwise.  strauss  indicates  that  schmitt   has merely prepared the way for a radical critique of liberalism. how- ever, schmitt “is tying himself to his opponents’ view of morality instead of questioning the  claim  of  humanitarian-pacifist  morality to be morals [[moral]]; he remains  trapped  in the view that he is attacking.”*’  it is important to note that the [[nature]]  of  strauss’s  critique  of schmitt indicates that whatever his own  critique  of liberalism  will be, it  cannot be  a  simple  reaffirmation  of  [[moral]]  truths [[truth]].  rather (and all too gnomically) “it is o [[understand]] [[socrates]],” as the highlighted  words  beginning  the introduction  and chapters [[chapter]] 3 and

here, as heinrich meier points out, that schmitt never engaged in a full-fledged confrontation with nietzsche."
to some of those on the left, schmitt’s according of primacy
to the [[political]] thus appears to open the door to a [[kind]] of postmod- ernism.’' here, his insistence on the centrality of antagonistic rela- tions and his [[resistance]] to an abstract, not to say “thin,” under- standing of agency fit in well with those who see liberalism as a historical event. to see liberalism as a historical event means that one understands it as the inheritor and bearer not only of  rights [[right]] and freedoms but also of structures of [[power]] and domination, of colonial and class exploitations, of the [[hatred]] of, rather than the opposition to, the other.’*
such  a   response   to  schmitt   is,  however,  a  highly selective
choice of some elements of his doctrine. it tacitly  introduces  ele- ments of [[democracy]] by pluralizing his notion of sovereignty a nd suggesting that the decision about the  exception  is  a  decision  that each [[person]] can make. i t is to claim that value-pluralism is not inherently   undesirable.’’  against   this  one  can   insist   that schmitt,
other chapters [[chapter]] in [[natural]] [[right]] and [[history]] all begin with the word “’j’he.” for a critique of‘ the strauss critique of schmitt, see john p. mccormic k, “f'ear, technology, and the [[state]]: carl schmitt,  leo strauss, anct  the  revival  of hobbes in weimar and national socialist ciermany,” [[political]] theory zz, no. q (november

no matter what else he m ight be, was not a democrat. he did not conceive sovereignty as something each [[individual]] might have but rather as the exercise of  [[power]]  by  the  [[state]].  it  is  to  this  central and “tough” notion of sovereignty that conservatives respond. the [[question]] raised here is whether one can accept  the formulations  of the concept of the [[political]] as (in schmitt’s words) “the starting  point for objective discussion” and not emerge from them in the direction that leo strauss took.” i leave unanswered  and  barely [[asked]] if there could be a straussianism of the left in [[america]], an [[alliance]] of berkeley and chicago, as it were.”

legitimation and enemies
in the concept of the [[political]], schmitt identifies as the “high points of politics” those moments in which “the [[enemy]] is, in  con- crete clarity, recognized as the [[enemy]].”  he  suggests  that  this  is true both theoretically and in practice." there  are  two  aspects  of this claim worthy of note. the first is the semi-hegelian form it assumes. the concrete recognition of the other as [[enemy]] and the consequent establishment of one’s own identity  sounds  something like hegel’s master and [[slave]], especially if [[read]] through a kojevian lens. i suspect, in [[fact]], that it is this aspect which [[led]] the ss journal dan schwarze korps to accuse schmitt of neo-hegelianism.”
but only the form is hegelian. there are two elements in schmitt’s cla inn about enemies [[enemy]] which are not hegelian. first is a suggestion that unless one is clear about the fundamental non ratio-

nality of [[politics]], one will likely be overtaken by events. following the passage about the “high points of [[politics]],” schmitt  goes on  to give examples [[example]] of those who were clear about what was friend and [[enemy]] and those who were not. he cites as clear-headed  some cierman opponents of napoleon; lenin in his condemnation of capitalism; and—most strik ingly—cromwell in his enmity to- ward [[spain]]. he contrasts these [[men]] to “the loomed classes [who] romanticized the russian peasant,”  and  to  the  “aristocratic  [[society]] in  [[france]]  before  the  [[revolution]]  of  i ys9 [who] sentimentalized
‘man who is by [[nature]] [[good]].’ ””  the  implication  here is that ratio-
nality—what is [[rational]] for a group to do to preserve itself as a group—is not  only  not  universal  but  hard  to  [[know]].  we  are  not far here from alastair mac i ntyre’s whose [[justice]]? whose rational- ity?” the important aspect to schmitt’s claim is  that it  is by  facing the friend-enemy distinction that we (a  “we”)  will  be  able  to  be clear about what  “we”  are  and  what  it  is  “rational”  for  “us”  to  do.
schmitt insists in his discussion of the friend -enemy distinc-
tion on the [[public]] [[nature]] of the categories. it is not  my  [[enemy]]  but our [[enemy]]; that is, “enemy” is a [[political]] concept. here schmitt enlists the [[public]] quality to [[politics]] in order to prevent a  universal- ism which he thinks [[think]] extremely dangerous. the argument goes  like this. [[resistance]] to or the refusal to accept the [[fact]] that one’s [[rational]] action has limitations determined by the quality of the identity  of one’s group leads to two possible outcomes.
the first is that one assumes one shares with others universal qualities which must then “naturally” engender an ultimate con- vergence  of  interests  attainable   through   negotiation  and  compro-

mise. here events  are most  likely  not  only  to  prove one  [[wrong]] but to [[destroy]] a group  that acts on such a  false  [[belief]].  (one thinks [[think]] of mar x’s caustic comments about the social-democrats in the eighteenth brumaire of eouis napoleon). this is the case with the “doomed”  russian  classes  and  the “aristocratic  society”  of [[france]].
the other, more dangerous possibility  is that one  will  claim  to speak in the name of universal [[humanity]]. in such a case, all those by whom one is opposed must perforce be seen as speaking against [[humanity]] and hence can only [[merit]] to be exterminated. schmitt writes:

humanity as such and as a whole has no enemies [[enemy]]. everyone be- longs to [[humanity]] . “humanity” thus becomes an asymmetrical counter-concept. if he discriminates within [[humanity]] and thereby denies the quality of being [[human]] to a disturber or destroyer, then the negatively valued [[person]] becomes an unperson, and his [[life]] is no longer of  the highest value: it becomes worthless and must be destroyed. concepts such as “human being” thus contain the possibility of the deepest  inequality and become thereby “asymmetrical.””

these words  were written in  i 9y6, but they  were prepared
for in the conclusion to the concept of the politi'cal: “the adversary is thus no longer called an [[enemy]] but a disturbe r of [[peace]] and is thereby designated to be an outlaw of [[humanity]].””  schmitt  wants here to remove from [[politics]], especially international  [[politics]]  but also internal [[politics]] of an ideological k ind, any possibility of justi- fying one’s action on the basis of a claim to universal [[moral]] princi- ples. he does so because he fears [[fear]] that in such a  framework  all  claims to [[good]] will recognize no limits  to  their  reach.  and,  thus, this century will see “wars for the domination of the earth”  (the phrase  is  nietzsche’s   in  ecce  homo),  that  is,  wars [[war]]  to  determine

once and for all what  is [[good]]  for all, wars [[war]]  with no outcome except an end to [[politics]] and the elimination of all difference.
on a first level, the [[question]] that schmitt poses here is whether liberalism can meet the challenges posed by international [[politics]].’* [[rousseau]] suggested that a [[country]] would be [[better]] off avoiding international [[politics]]; hobbes made no attempt to extend the notion of sovereignty beyond [[state]] borders.  any  [[answer]]  to this [[question]] must deal with the [[fact]] that this century has seen not only the d ramatic extension of countries [[country]] claiming to adhere to universal values but also unprecedented attempts at local and uni- versal genocide and the [[development]] of extremely aggressive re- gionalisms. for schmitt these all went together. he [[thought]] there was no [[natural]] limit to what one m ight do to make the [[world]] safe for liberalism. the evidence is mixed.
on a second level, one  must  ask  how  a  [[man]]  who  wrote with some eloquence about the dangers of universalism could have written what he wrote in support of nazi policies. three possible answers [[answer]] [[present]] themselves. the first  is  that  he  was  morally blinded by ambition—that he would say what  was  necessary  to attain and remain in prestigious  posts.  the second  is  that  he  did not [[understand]] what the nazis were doing. the [[last]]  is  that  he [[thought]] (or persuaded himself for some period of time) that the opponents of the  regime  were, in [[fact]], enemies [[enemy]],  who, in [[fact]],  posed  a threat to the  [[german]]  identity.  if  the  [[last]]  is  true, as  i  [[believe]]  it to  be,  then   what   needs  attention   in  schmitt’s   theory   is  not the

attack on universalism but the overly simplistic notion of friend. there is a way in which schmitt allowed his notion of [[enemy]] to generate his [[idea]] of friend.43

schmitt and nazism
does one’s [[judgment]] on schmitt come down to the way one reads the facts [[fact]] of schmitt’s adherence to the nazi party? among his more sympathetic commentators there is a tendency to apolo- gize and excuse. at least one response given by those who sympa- thize with schmitt’s [[work]] will not do. this is the one repeated by the editors of telos to professor jeffrey herf: they rehearse answers [[answer]] like that of paul tillich, who responded to a student who objected to heidegger on the grounds of his participation in the nazi party by pointing out that [[plato]] had after all served the [[tyrant]] dionysos of syracuse and we do not therefore refrain from reading him.44 while the quality of a person’s [[thought]] can in no way be reduced to a person’s actions, this is only because no action admits, in a mo- ment, of only the meaning that [[time]] will give to it. one cannot sim- ply draw a line between [[thought]] and [[life]] as if choices in [[life]] could be judged by criteria [[foreign]] to [[thought]]. context matters, and not in a self-evident way.45 however, to ask the [[question]] of what schmitt [[thought]] he was doing—his intentions—can also not be ﬁ- nal. to [[understand]] everything is precisely not to excuse it. purity of intentions matters for little and is often dangerous in [[politics]].46

it seems to me relatively clear that in most aspects of his [[thought]] schmitt’s understanding of [[law]] and the [[world]] did not [[change]] throughout his [[life]]. this includes at least some aspects of his open anti-semitism during the period 1933 – 36.47 frightening in schmitt’s case is the possibility that precisely what many ﬁnd attractive in schmitt must open, while not requiring them to take, the possibility of the route he took. i want brieﬂy to suggest that this is a [[question]] we must face. consider the possibilities.
the approach taken by strauss and meier consists in argu- ing that schmitt, while attempting a radical critique of liberalism, remains within the liberal framework. (such an accusation is sim- ilar to the one heidegger makes about nietzsche as attempting a radical critique of western metaphysics while remaining in the metaphysical framework.) the implication therefore is that the choices schmitt makes are not excluded by the liberal framework; that is, they take place in the terms allowed by that framework. the [[question]] here becomes the manner in which one can mitigate the dangerous possibilities inherent in liberalism, since for the his- torical [[present]] and apparent future no alternative is available. the commitment to liberalism is thus instrumental.
the position taken by the contributors to telos as well as many of schmitt’s other english-language defenders derives from the feeling that the liberal tradition no longer offers the intellec- tual resources to meet the challenges (especially those of techno- logical domination and bureaucratized capitalism) of the [[modern]] [[world]]. central to this pressing need for new theoretical resources is the collapse of marxism as a viable ﬁrst-world theoretical

stance. in this perspective, the preservation of (and, indeed, em- phasis on) the forms of liberal [[institutions]] further undermines  the values those [[institutions]] were originally supposed to promote. (this was the gist of schmitt’s analysis also, of course.) here the rejection of liberal structures is made in the name of (more or less) liberal values. but the only structure proposed is a kinder and gentler antagonistics than the existentially intense ones in schmitt.
liberals are horriﬁed at schmitt because he offends against one of the deepest premises of liberalism: [[politics]] is necessary but should not become too serious. as robert lane wrote a long [[time]] ago, liberal [[politics]] requires “a touch of anomie” about the [[public]] sphere.48 most important, liberal [[politics]] take the form of claim- ing that [[politics]] should never be about identity and that to the de- gree that policy decisions affect what it means to be a [[person]] those decisions are divisive and dangerous. for liberals, rights [[right]] are rights [[right]] no matter how gained: they have little truck with the claim of what one might call schmitt-leaning democrats that rights [[right]] are not rights [[right]] unless they are fought for and won, such that they become our rights [[right]].49
why these reactions now? there is no [[question]] but that the left and the [[right]] are, in their interest in schmitt, responding to a perceived need to ﬁnd other sources for [[political]] theorizing.50 clearly there is a sense that the [[political]] categories imposed on us

by the relation to the [[monarchy]] of various parts of the 1791 french national assembly have played their way out in the face of [[modern]] technologically and rationalized industrial [[society]].
there is also another [[reason]], this one more generational. an intellectual consequence of the [[experience]] with nazism was to effectively shrink, perhaps one might say homogenize, the lan- guage and terms of [[political]] debate in the subsequent period. as the nazi [[experience]] fades from [[consciousness]] (at just over sixty years of [[age]], i am among the [[last]] to have been born during the [[war]] and to have been taught by those with adult [[consciousness]] during the war), so also possibilities excluded by the specter of auschwitz have returned. the revival of interest in schmitt is consequent, i [[believe]], to this increasing distance from the 1930s. how we manage the intellectual terrain that we are opening up is our responsibility.

notes on “the [[age]] of neutralizations and depoliticizations”
at a conference in barcelona, [[spain]], in 1929, carl schmitt gave a lecture on the topic of “the [[age]] of neutralizations and depoliticizations.” the lecture was published in 1930 and was added to the edition of the concept of the [[political]] when it ap- peared in 1932. schmitt thus [[thought]] of it as part of his general argument in that [[book]]; it is appropriate and important that it ap- pear in this expanded edition.1
as noted, a central theme to the concept of the [[political]] is the “friend-foe” distinction, a distinction that serves as the quasi- transcendental presupposition of the [[political]]. as the [[political]] is for schmitt the realm of that which is truly [[human]],2 his distress is that the west is losing touch with that which gives [[life]] [[human]] meaning. the argument he develops in the barcelona lecture pre-

sents the west as standing at the most recent of a series of “cen- tral domains of [[thought]].” “central domains” play here pretty much the same role for schmitt as paradigms do for thomas kuhn.3 thus: “if a domain of [[thought]] becomes central, then the problems of other domains are solved in terms of the central do- mains—they are considered secondary problems, whose solution follows as a matter of course only if the problems of the central domain are solved” (“the [[age]] of neutralizations and depoliti- cizations,” p. 86). in the [[modern]] west, schmitt sees danger in the increasing sense of the [[state]] as just “a huge industrial plant.”4 in- creasingly this plant “runs by itself . . . [and] the decisionistic and personalistic element in the concept of sovereignty is lost.”5 schmitt’s task is to recover this element in contemporary times [[time]].
there have been ﬁve domains since the renaissance, each loosely identiﬁed with a century. as he lays it out in the barcelona lecture, the [[history]] of the [[last]] ﬁve hundred years in the west shows a [[common]] structure: as the controlling [[force]] has changed, so also have what counts as evidence, as well as what was the so- cial and [[political]] elite. thus in the sixteenth century the [[world]] was structured around an explicitly theological understanding with [[god]] and the scriptures [[scripture]] as foundational certainties; this was replaced in the next century by metaphysics and [[rational]] (“scien- tiﬁc”) research and in the eighteenth by ethical humanism with its central notions of [[duty]] and [[virtue]]. in the nineteenth century eco- nomics comes to dominate (although schmitt is seen as a [[man]] of the [[right]] he always took marx completely seriously), and, ﬁnally, in the twentieth century technicity is the ordering of the day. and this is at the core of his claim that ours is an [[age]] of “neutraliza-

tion and depoliticization”: whereas all previous eras had leaders and decision makers—what he calls clercs—the era of technology and technological [[progress]] has no need of [[individual]] persons [[person]].6
schmitt uses the french clerc and no [[doubt]] has in [[mind]] the 1927 [[book]] by julien benda, la trahison des clercs (the betrayal of the intellectuals).7 but whereas benda had seen the clercs as turn- ing away from [[spiritual]] and eternal values to temporal and polit- ical activity, schmitt, tacitly opposing benda, sees the clerc as the [[person]] who most centrally grasps and formulates the core of a particular central domain.8
the central quality of all transformations that have [[led]] to our [[present]] stage—technicity—is the “striving for a neutral do- main.” for [[europe]], the attraction of a neutral domain is that it seems to provide a solution to the conﬂicts that had grown up out of quarrels over theology. it transformed the concepts elaborated by “centuries of theological reﬂection” into what are for schmitt “merely private matters” (and, 90). however, each stage of neu- tralization became, in schmitt’s analysis, merely the next arena of struggle. here it is important to see that what someone like john rawls sees as one of the most important achievements of the west—religious toleration—is for schmitt merely the prelude to another form of conﬂict.

6 this periodization can also be found in shorter form in the 1934 preface to [[political]] theology, pp. 1–2. the stages are well discussed in henning ottmann, “das zeitalter der neutralisierungen und enttotalisierungen: carl schmitts the- orie der neuzeit,” in reinhard mehring, ed. carl schmitt: der begriff des politis- chen; ein kooperativer kommentar (berlin: akademie verlag., 2003), pp. 156 –169. see the more extensive discussion in my foreword to [[political]] theology.
7 a contemporary edition is julien benda, la trahison des clercs (les cahiers rouges: grasset, 2003).
8 thus jacob taubes, one of the most insightful readers of schmitt, can write about schmitt in the [[political]] theology of paul (stanford: stanford univer- sity press, 2004), p. 103: “he is a clerk, and he understands his position to be not to establish the [[law]] but to interpret the [[law]].”
xxx	tracy b. strong
the central [[question]] now, therefore, is what conﬂicts will arise when the central domain is technology, which, “precisely be- cause it serves all . . . is not neutral” (and, 91). here schmitt ﬁnds himself in opposition to thinkers like weber, troeltsch, and rathenau, whom he reads as succumbing to the “disenchantment of the [[world]] (entzauberung der welt).” if one follows them, schmitt says, one will despair, for the [[world]] will appear only as what weber called a “casing as hard as steel” with no way or even sight out.9 this leads to quietism, the most important danger now confronting [[europe]]. this danger arises because it is russia (i.e., the ussr) that has understood and seized technicity and made it its own in the new arena of conﬂict. only in russia does one now ﬁnd a sense of a new “strong [[politics]].”
schmitt writes somewhat chillingly in the concept of the [[political]] that “if a [[people]] no longer possesses the energy or the will to maintain itself in the sphere of [[politics]], the latter will not thereby vanish from the [[world]]. only a [[weak]] [[people]] will disap- pear.”10 he thus closes his article with a truncated citation from vergil’s fourth eclogue: “ab integro nascitur ordo.” this full line is “magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo,” which trans- lates as “a [[great]] order of the ages [[age]] is born from the renewal.” schmitt’s abbreviated line means “an order is born from the re- newal.” it is worth noting both that this line served as the origin for the motto on the [[great]] seal of the [[united]] states devised by charles thompson (an eminent latinist), and that vergil’s fol- lowing line speaks of the coming of a new child (understood by medieval [[christianity]] to be a prophecy of the coming of christ). schmitt ends his posthumously published glossarium with “with each newly born child a new [[world]] is born. [[god]] willing, each

newly born child will be an aggressor!”11 the eloquent two clos- ing paragraphs of schmitt’s barcelona article are in effect a call for the west to be [[equal]] to the need for this renewed conﬂict and to oppose the forces [[force]] of communism. one can only imagine what he might say in the [[present]] [[age]] as the [[united]] states calls, in more or less explicitly theological terms, for a conﬂict between the west and “radical islam.”12

the french [[political]] philosopher  julien  freund  has observed that “by a [[curious]] paradox the name schmitt  is surrounded  by  mist, and it may be [[asked]] whether this fog is not often manufactured artificially.... it is fashionable to  discredit  the  [[work]]  of  this  author on the  basis  of  a  [[reputation]]  that  is  based  largely  on  rumors  ...

noone  indeed  has questioned  the  prolific ness of  schmitt, and
few   have  questioned   the   profundity   of   his   writings.   but  his  de-
cision, after the enabling act of march 93s, to become the selt- appointed ideologue of the nazis has made him so controversial ' that even today it is difficult to view his [[work]] objectively.’ the

carl schmitt was born in isss into a [[family]] of devout cath- olics in the predominantly protestant town of plettenberg in west- phalia. he received his initial formal [[education]] in a catholic school. later, while continuing his humanistic studies, he resided in a catholic institution. subsequently  he  [[studied]]  [[law]]  at  the  universities [[university]] of berlin and strasbourg and  received  his doctorate  in  jurisprudence in iqio. after working as a [[law]] clerk, he entered the academic [[world]] and   taught  at  the  [[university]]  of  strasbourg  in  iqi6, at  the graduate
school of  [[business]] administration at munich from  igi 9 to 19°•, the

was fascinated by and proud of the [[power]] the catholic [[church]] had exerted on so powerful a figure as bismarck. this [[pride]] can be seen in his early conception of the [[state]] as an entity  whose  function  is  to realize [[right]] (rech i) . and because of the universal [[nature]] of the
catholic [[church]] it was, according to schmitt, in a [[better]] position to decide on what constitutes [[right]] than the many states then in existence.’
but [[world]] [[war]] i, germany’s defeat, and the controversial
terms of the versailles treaty produced a new [[political]] reality in germany.  this  induced  schmitt  to  focus  his  attention   on   some   of the concrete problems facing the weimar [[republic]].’

6	the concept of the political
volume.' here, however, i should like to  point  out  that  schmitt raised the [[question]] : what is the [[modern]] [[european]] [[state]] ? in  his [[answer]] he attempted, on the one hand, to  derive  a  model  of this [[state]], and, on the other, to focus particular attention on  the centrifu- gal forces [[force]] within the [[state]] that were responsible for tearing it apart. though this essay contains only germs of what subsequently matured into a relatively complete model," in the opening sentence of the
i932 essay schmitt indivisibly  linked [[state]] and  [[politics]]. reflecting on
the connection between the two, he recently commented:

the decisive [[question]] ... concerns  the  relationship  of  ...  [[state]]  and [[politics]]. a doctrine which began to take shape in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a cioctrine inaugurated by machiavelli, jean bodin, and thomas hobbes, endowed  the  [[state]]  with  an  important  [[monopoly]]: the [[european]] [[state]] became the sole [[subject]] of poiitics. both [[state]] and [[politics]] were linked  just as indivisibly  as  polis and  [[politics]] in  [[aristotle]]."

concretely speaking, only states, and not just any domestic  or international association,  are  the  bearers  of  [[politics]].  hence  only states   may   conduct   with  each   other   relations   which   in   an ultimate

sense are binding on their respective members. though such relations revolve fundamentally around  questions [[question]]  pertaining  to  [[politics]],  this  by no means implies that other categories—economic, [[religious]], cultural—do not also come into play.  yet,  according  to  schmitt  in the essay translated here, even ostensibly nonpolitical categories have the potential of becoming [[political]]. once a nonpolitical category acuminates in [[politics]], only the [[state]] is then in the position  to decide  on its interests anal undertake  appropriate  actions.  it  thus  follows that in concrete circumstances it is the prerogative of the  [[state]]  to define the content and course of [[politics]].
precisely because of  the  uniqueness  of  events, schmitt  found it impossible  to  provide an  exhaustive or even  a  general  definition  of [[politics]], one that would always  hold  true.'"  by  combining  his [[belief]] in the uniqueness of events  with  his  [[belief]]  that  [[man]]  is basically dangerous, schmitt advanced  a  simple criterion  of  [[politics]] in this essay which so far has proven to be constant, namely, the distinction between friend and [[enemy]].
although  schmitt  is  not  one  of  those  in  germany  who con-
sider [[war]] to be a social ideal, something to be cherished, or  some- thing normal, it is, nevertheless, an ever [[present]] possibility." but the decision as to whether or not to go to [[war]] is  a  purely  [[political]]  decision and hence, in schmitt’s construction,  something  only  the [[state]] can  decide.'* more  precisely,  as  a  [[state]]  cannot  [[exist]]  without a

l • because [[sovereign]] states constantly confront each other in the [[political]] arena with the obvious implication of the ever [[present]] possibility of [[war]], the late leo strauss in his comments on schmitt’s essay, correctly observed that a connection exists between schmitt and thomas hobbes. whether one speaks
8	the concept of the political
sovereign [[authority]], it is this [[authority]] which in the final analysis decides whether such an extreme  situation  is  at  hand."  schmitt  thus links [[state]], [[politics]], and sovereignty.
this linking of [[state]], [[politics]], and sovereignty makes it clear
that  schmitt’s  major  concern  is  with   the  [[modern]]   [[sovereign]]   [[state]]  as it began  to  emerge  in  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries.  from the general tone of the essay it is also clear that he personally iden- tified himself with this epoch and laments  that  the  curtain  was descending. it may well  be  [[asked]]  why  he should  object  to  the  closing of this period—especially in view of its [[violence]]. although one can extract  the  [[answer]]  from  his  ig3z  essay,  he  provided  it  himself  in some of his subsequent writings.
with exceptions, the epoch of the [[european]] [[sovereign]] [[state]] may be characterized as a period in which order  prevailed  within [[sovereign]] states and also in the relations between [[sovereign]] states. the [[peace]] of  augsburg  (i  j$$),  the  [[religious]]  compromise  of  eliza- beth i (i$yq—i §63), and the edict of nantes (i5 q8) were significant

of the possibility of [[war]] or  the conflict  itself, one  difference  between  schmitt and  hobbes  is that, whereas for  the latter  it  “is  the [[state]]  of  [[war]]  of  individuals
—for schmitt it is the [[state]] of [[war]]  of  groups,  and  especially  of  nations.” though it is true that  states  in  schmitt’s  construction  are  constantly  con- fronted by this  possibility,  and  from  this  view  might  be  said  to  [[exist]]  in  a [[state]] of [[nature]], a qualitative difference does [[exist]] between  hobbes’s  and  schmitt’s [[state]] of [[nature]] [see helmut  rumpf,  carl  sch milt  und  thomas hobbes:  ldeellc  bezieh ungen  und  apluelle  bedeutung   mit  einer  abbaiidlun g

pp. 9—i i below), we are not justified in ascribing  to  schmitt  a  sort  of hobbesian [[state]] of [[nature]].  at  the  critical  point  in  hobbes’s  [[state]]  of  [[nature]] [[man]] may truly find himself in actual  combat, and  in  such  a  situation,  accord- ing to hobbes, “nothing can be  [[unjust]].  the  notions  of  [[right]]  and  [[wrong]], [[justice]] and [[injustice]] have  there  no  place....  [[force]]  and  fraud,  are  in  warre the two cardinall virtues” (lr«io/âna, chap. i 3) .

steps in the movement  toward  [[religious]]  toleration—the recognition on the part of new'1y emerging [[sovereign]] rulers in distinct territorial states ” that christians [[christian]], regardless of specific doctrinal  differences, were entitled to be treated as christians [[christian]]  and  not as beings possessed by the [[devil]] to whom no quarter should be given. once it was ac- cepted in [[principle]] that  christians [[christian]]  are  [[equal]]  by  [[virtue]] of  belonging to the same [[religion]], developments at [[home]] had definite  repercus- sions  insofar  as  relations  among  [[sovereign]]   states   were concerned.
hence, despite doctrinal differences, catholic and protestant rulers were prepared to coexist in a larger [[community]].  an  implica- tion of this [[development]] was that agreements could be concluded by [[sovereign]] states in [[time]] of [[peace]] with a reasonable expectation that these would be adhered to. moreover, a secularized notion of [[politics]] enabled rules [[rule]] and regulations to emerge  which  applied  in  [[time]]  of [[war]] as well. and this mitigated the devastation that had character- ized [[past]] con fiicts,l ’
among other things, the emerging jun publicu m eiiropaeti m clearly distinguished a [[state]] of [[peace]] from that of [[war]], and clear-cut distinctions were also drawn between combatants  and  noncombat- ants, between combat and noncombat areas, and the cessation of hostilities was usually followed by a [[peace]] treaty. furthermore, prisoners [[prisoner]] of [[war]] were entitled to be  treated  humanely,  and  the concept of neutrality was also sanctioned."
these  developments  contributed   to  changing   the  concept of
the  [[public]]  adversary, something schmitt  did  not see  very  clearly  in
'• despite nominally reasserting the traditional allegiance  owed  by  princes [[prince]] to the [[emperor]], [[empire]], and diet, the  treaty  of  westphalia  (i6d8) stipulated  that  princes [[prince]]  in  their  respective  territorial  domains  were  [[sovereign]] “in matters both ecclesiastical and political” (article 6q).  article  65  consider- ably reinforced the previous one by ascribing  to  the  princes [[prince]]  their  [[right]]  of making or interpreting laws [[law]] and declaring wars [[war]]. ”

i93z." what we in [[fact]]  witness  is  the  transformation  of  the  foe concept in favor of the [[public]] [[enemy]] notion, i.e., the  subjection  of warfare to prescribed rules [[rule]] and  regulations;  hence  feelings  of  per-  sonal   hatred—so   rampant    when   ideology    dominates  politics—sub-
sided.’° schmitt alluded to this in 1932 when he said in the essay translated here that the [[enemy]] no longer had to be “hated personally” and that an “enemy exists only when, at  least  potentially, one fight- ing collectivity of [[people]] confronts a similar collectivity.” the secu- larization of [[politics]] th us facilitated the [[growth]] of the /us publics m europaeum,  and  this  was  accompanied  by  a  new  mode  of warfar•
in which the adversary was considered a “clean” [[enemy]]. i n i 963 schmitt   observed   that   the  secularization  of   [[politics]]  constituted  a
definite mark of “progress in the sense of [[humanity]].” "
despite critical attacks on the [[sovereign]] [[state]] and  the  /ns publics m europaeum that accompanied its [[development]] (e.g., the french [[revolution]] and the napoleonic wars [[war]], and, in the domain of [[political]] [[thought]], the infusion of militant ideology into [[politics]]  by marx  and  engels),  the  [[state]]  withstood  these  until  the  early   part of the twentieth century. but the rapid succession of momentous events—world [[war]] i, versailles, the communist [[victory]]  in  mos- cow, and  the  nazi  [[victory]]  in  berlin  about  one year  after  the publi-
cation  of the  i 932 t e xt of schmitt’s essay—halted  the  broad course
of [[development]] of the epoch of the [[european]] [[sovereign]] [[state]] and also soon showed that the traditional  [[european]]  [[sovereign]]  [[state]]  was no  longer  a   politically   viable  entity  in  a  rapidly  changing [[world]].

moreover, as this [[state]] rested on and functioned under a secular notion of [[politics]], the infusion of militant ideology into [[politics]] underminecl the state’s very foundation. by [[virtue]] of its contamina- tion with militant ideology, the new [[politics]] possessed a sort of “surplus val ue.”” thus the ideologically committed totalitarian one-party states readily dismissed the [[principle]] on which the j«i publicum europaeum was predicated, namely, the [[genuine]] accep- tance by [[sovereign]] states of the [[principle]] pacta sunt servandu. the rules [[rule]] of the game governing relations of [[sovereign]] states were, therefore, no longer sacrosanct but were incorporated  into the arse- nal of [[weapons]] of one-party  states  and  utilized  as  tactical  devices in gaining specific ends. and, finally, with the [[victory]] of ideologies considered to be a true and absolute one, the  adversary  was  no longer considered a “clean”  [[enemy]],  but  a  despised  foe  to  whom no quarter should be given.
i ii
though schmitt clearly saw in iq32 that the curtain was descending on an epoch, he undoubtedly would have welcomed the arrest and even the reversal of this process. it may perhaps be argued that, in view of  germany’s  central  geographic  location  in  [[europe]], its resources, level of industrialization, and overall potential, a politically healthy germany could have aided in halting this process,  at least temporarily. yet, despite  germany’s  assets, she  was  unable to reassert herself in the arena of [[world]] [[politics]], not because  of policies pursued  by  her  former  adversaries,  but  primarily because of   domestic  economic  and  [[political]]  circumstances.  since  she  was
unable to put her house in order, schmitt i r '93a continued rather despairingly   tc  point  to  what   he  [[thought]]   to  be  sensible  solutions to
halt the disintegration of the weimar [[state]].

2° in a related context, i have discussed  this [[question]]  in  “appeasement  and detentc: some reflections,” detente in historical perspecti've, câ. george schwab and henry friedlandcr (new york: cyrco press, •975) •‹
12	the concept of the political
thus, in “the concept of the political” and in many  of  his other writings, schmitt focused attention on the immediate cen- trifugal forces [[force]] tearing the weimar [[state]] apart and on some of the intellectual underpinnings of these forces [[force]], including pluralism. as is well known, the theory of  pluralism  maintains  that  an [[individual]]  is  a member of many rather than just one [[human]] association, and no association, including the [[state]], is necessarily the decisive and sover- eign one. in the competition among associations for the loyalty of individuals [[individual]], the  [[individual]]  is  left  to  decide  for  himself the  extent to which he may [[desire]] to become involved. precisely such a doc-  trine, according to schmitt, helps to undermine the [[state]]  as  the highest and most decisive entity.
though formulated as a theory only recently, some of the concrete manifestations were already somewhat more than faintly visible in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. it was of particular concern to schmitt that [[certain]] [[political]] forces [[force]] which emerged in the [[modern]] [[state]] had begun to [[question]] and even challenge the state’s [[monopoly]] on [[politics]]. the appearance and [[growth]] of such domestic forces [[force]] often caused states to immerse themselves in internal [[political]] struggles, and this not only weakened the state’s posture  vis-a-vis other states, but undermined the [[sovereign]] [[state]] in general.
in other words, as long as the state’s [[monopoly]] on [[politics]] was not seriously challenged from within, its  posture,  depending  of course on the state’s overall resources, was one of [[strength]]. rhe state’s immersion in domestic [[political]] struggles and some of the conse- quences of this under lies [[lie]] schmitt’s discussion. in reflecting on this added dimension schmitt was [[led]] to draw a distinction between “politics” and  “political.”  his  decision  not  to  entitle   his  essay the concept  of  po/i/fci but, instead,  ter  concept o| ltte polttical, is a reflection of this distinction.
whereas [[state]] and [[politics]] were indivisibly linked in the clas- sical [[european]] [[state]], schmitt recently observed that

the classical profile of the [[state]] was shattered as its [[monopoly]] on [[politics]] waned. new ...	political  protagonists asserted  themselves.	from
introduction	'3
this (ollowed a new [[degree]]  of  reflection  for  theoretical  [[thought]].  now one could distinguish “politics” from “political.” the new protagonists become the core of the entire complex  of  problems  called  “political.” here lies [[lie]] the beginning and thrust  of  every  attempt  to  recognize  the many new subjects [[subject]] of the [[political]], which become  active  in  [[political]] reality, in the [[politics]] of the  [[state]]  or  nonstate,  and  which  bring  about new kinds [[kind]] of friend-enemy groupings."

bearing in [[mind]] the circumstances under which weimar was born, the liberal democratic [[nature]] of its  [[constitution]],  and  the extremist [[political]] movements which were permitted to thrive there, schmitt, as already observed, was appalled at how the [[state]] was being turned into a whipping post, and his [[hope]] was to turn the situation around.
in his endeavor to strengthen the weimar [[state]], schmitt chal- lenged a basic liberal assumption then widely held either (or  philo- sophica i or tactical reasons [[reason]], namely, that  every  [[political]]  party,  no matter how antirepublican, must be permitted freely to compete for parliamentary representation  and  for  governmental   [[power]].“   this meant that the sole  requirement  of  such  parties  in  their  quest  for [[power]] was that they proceed legally.'* because the most influential commentators  and jurists  of  the  weimar  [[constitution]]  argued  that  it was an open document insofar  as  any  and  all  constitutional  revisions are permissible if these are brought about legally,2‘ a totalitarian

movement which succeeds in legally capturing the legislature can then proceed legally to forge a [[constitution]] and [[state]] that would reflect its militant [[political]] ideology.
cognizant that the [[political]] left and [[right]] utilized bourgeois legality  as a weapon in  the quest for [[power]] a nd fearful of  a [[victory]]  by one of the extremist  movements  with  the  ideological  subversion of the [[state]] [[certain]]  to [[follow]], schmitt  saw  little  [[hope]]  in  the  ability of the weimar [[state]] to sur v've u nless its leadership was immediately prepared  to  distinguish  friend  from  [[enemy]]  and   to  act accordingly.
concretely speaking, he argued in i 9sz that only those parties not intent  on  subverting  the  [[state]]  be  granted   the  [[right]]   to  compete for
parliamentary and governmental [[power]].” this obviously  meant  driving the extremists on both sides of  the  [[political]]  spectrum  from the open arena.“
given the relative ease with which basic constitutional revi- sions could be brought about (article y6), and the widespread adherence to legalist thinking—factors militating against the effec- tiveness o( the presidency—schmitt, toward the end of the weimar period, sought to strengthen drastically the president’s hands,  and hence  he  developed  the  [[idea]]  of  a  presidential  [[system]].  although  his presidential [[system]] had its roots in the weimar [[constitution]], schmitt’s  conception   went  beyond   this  document  and   was, there-

fore, no  longer  in  accord  with  the  constitution’s  spirit  and  letter. in other words, he was willing to sacr.fice  a  part  of  the  [[constitution]] in order to save and  strengthen  the  existing  [[state]].  by  advocating such an extreme position, a position certainly unacceptable to the legalists, schmitt clearly implied, among other things, that he would accept [[political]] parties and the weimar [[parliament]] only on the condition that they be subordinate to and [[united]] with the president in the search for solutions.
as i have noted  elsewhere,  schmitt’s  presidential  [[system]] centered on  the  popularly  elected   president.   as  commander-in-chief of the armed forces [[force]], with the potent article q8 of the weimar con- stitution at his disposal and aided in his exercise of [[power]] by the bureaucracy and reichswehr, the president, in sch mitt’s view, could certainly have arrested the [[political]]  assaults on  the [[state]].°’ yet  today it  is  widely charged  that  the  presidential  [[system]]  which   came  about in  the  [[last]]  years  of weimar  had  in  [[fact]]  paved  the  way  for  hitler. but this misses schmitt’s point.
the [[system]] which  finally  emerged  was an  emasculated  form of what he had urged. hence, despite schmitt’s pleas for the  neces-  sity of distinguishing friend from [[enemy]], hindenburg consistently labored under the impact of legalist doctrines and did not, therefore, forcefully move to arrest  and  eliminate  the  [[political]]  challenges facing ¥veimar. quite the contrary. not only did  he  continue  to permit negatively inclined parties to operate and compete for [[power]], but he also loathed ruling by decree.’0 it appears  that  he  was  under the confused impression that [[rule]] by  decree  might  contradict  the  oath to defend the [[constitution]] which he took upon assuming the presidency (article 42).

the concept of the  [[state]]  presupposes  the  concept  of  the [[political]].
according to [[modern]] linguistic usage, the [[state]] is the [[political]] status of an organized [[people]] in an enclosed territorial unit. this is nothing more than a  general  paraphrase,  not  a  definition  of  the [[state]]. since we are concerned here with the [[nature]]  of  the  [[political]], such a definition is  unwarranted. it may  be  left open  what  the [[state]]  is in its essence—a machine or an organism, a [[person]] or an  institu- tion, a [[society]] or a [[community]], an enterprise or  a  beehive,  or  per- haps even a basic procedural order. these definitions and images anticipate too much mea ning, interpretation, illustration, and con- struction, and therefore cannot constitute any appropriate point of departure for a simple and elementary statement.
in its literal sense and in its historical appearance the [[state]] is a specific entity of a [[people]].• vis-a-vis the many conceivable kinds [[kind]] of
schmitt has in [[mind]] the [[modern]] national  [[sovereign]]  [[state]]  and  not  the [[political]] entities of the medieval  or  ancient  periods.  for  schmitt's  identifica- tion with the epoch of  the  moder n  [[state]]  see george  schwab,  tb e  c hallengc o] the exception.’ an  introduction  to  the  [[political]]  ideas [[idea]]  of  p.arl  schmitt  between 9° and zq 6 zd ed.

entities, it is in the decisive  case the  ultimate  [[authority]].  more  need not be said at this moment. all characteristics of this image of  entity and  [[people]]  receive  their  meaning  from  the  further  distinctive  trait of the  [[political]]  and  become  incomprehensible  when  the  [[nature]]  of the [[political]] is misunderstood.
one seldom fi nds a clear  definition of  the  [[political]]. the  word is most f requently used negatively, in contrast to various other ideas [[idea]],  for [[example]] in such antitheses as [[politics]] and economy, [[politics]] and morality, [[politics]] and  [[law]] ;  and  within  [[law]]  there  is  again  [[politics]] and civil [[law]],' and so forth. by means of such negative, often also polemical confrontations, it is usually possible, depending upon the context and concrete situation, to  characterize  something  with  clar- ity. but this is still not a specific definition. in one way or another “political” is generally juxtaposed to  “state”  or  at  least  is  brought into relation with it.2 the  [[state]]  thus  appears  as something  [[political]], the [[political]] as something pertaining to the state—obviously an un- satisfactory circle.

' the antithesis  of  [[law]]  and  [[politics]]  is easily  confused  by  the  antithesis of  civil  and  [[public]]  [[law]].  according  to  j.  k.  bluntschli  in  all gemeines staats-
recht, cth  ed.  (munich:  j. g. cotta,  i 868), i, zi9: “pfopcrty  is a  civil  [[law]]  and
not  a   [[political]]   concept.”   the   [[political]]   significance   of   this  antithesis came
particularly to the fore in i925 a old i9z6, during the debates regarding the expropriation of the fortunes [[fortune]] of the princes [[prince]] who had  formerly  ruled  in  ger- many. the following sentence from the [[speech]] by deputy dietrich (reichstag
session, december  z, i9z5, bericafe,  47i 7)  is cited as an [[example]]: “we are of
the  [[opinion]]   that  the  issues  here  do  not  at  all  pertain   to  civil  [[law]]  questions
but are purely [[political]] ones. ”
° also in those definitions of the [[political]] which utilize the concept  of [[power]] as the decisive factor, this [[power]] appears mostly as [[state]] [[power]], for [[example]], in max weber’s “politik  als  beruf,”  geiam mclic  politischc  schrif- ten.  3•d  ed.,  ed.  johannes   winckelmann    (tiibingen:   j.  c.   b.   mohr  [paul
siebeck] ,  197  )   pp   5o5,  •;o6:   “aspiring   to  participate  in  or  of influencing
the distribution  of  [[power]],  be it  between  states,  be  it  internally  between groups
the    conce pt  o|  the  political	!
many such descriptions of the [[political]] appear in professional juridic literature. insofar as these are  not  politically  polemical,  they are of practical and tech nical interest and  are  to  be  understood  as legal or administrative decisions in particular cases. these  then  re- ceive their meaning by the presupposition of a  stable  [[state]]  within whose framework they operate. thus there exists, for [[example]], a jurisprudence and literature pertaining to the concept of the  [[political]] cltib or the [[political]] meeting in the [[law]] of associations. furthermore, french administrative [[law]] practice has attempted  to  construct  a concept of the [[political]] motive (m obile politique) with whose aid [[political]] acts of [[government]] (actes de gon ver nem ent) could be dis- tinguished from nonpolitical administrative acts and thereby removed trom the control of administrative courts."
such  accommodating  definitions serve  the  needs of  legal prac-
of  [[people]]  which  the  [[state]]  encompasses,”  or  “leadership  or  the  influencing  o( a [[political]]  association,  hence  today, of  a  state”;  or  his  “parliament  und regie-
rung im neugeord neten  de utsch [[land]],”  ibid., p  347:  “the  essence  of  [[politics]] is  ...      combat,  the  winning  of  allies and  of  voluntary  followers.”  h. triepel,
staatsrecht und politi) (berlin : w. de g ruyter & co., 9°7) pp- •*—• 7. says: “until recent decades  [[politics]]  was  still  plainly  associated  with  the  study  of  the  [[state]]....  in  this  vein  weitz  characterizes  poi ities  as  the  learned discus-
sion of the [[state]] with [[respect]] to the  historical  [[development]]  of  states  on  the whole as well as of their current conditions and needs.” triepel then  justly criticizes the ostensibly nonpolitical, purely juristic approach of the  cerber- laband school and the attempt at  its  continuation  in  the  postwar  period (kelsen) . nevertheless, triepel had not yet  recognized  the  pure  [[political]] meaning of this pretence of an apolitical purity, because he subscribes to the equation [[politics]] = [[state]].  as  will still  be seen  below,  designating  the adversary as [[political]] and oneself as nonpolitical (i.e., scientific,  just,  objective,  neutral, etc.)  is in actuality  a  typical  and  unusually  intensive  way  of  pursuing [[politics]].
...      for   the  criterion   of   the   [[political]]   furnished   here (friend-enemy
orientation), i draw upon the particularly  interesting  de£nition  of  the  spe- cifically [[political]] acte dc gonuernement which dufour . . (traité de droi°t administrati f ap plique, v, i 28) has advanced:  “defining  an  act  of  govern- ment is the [[purpose]] to which  the  author  addresses  himself.  such  an  act  a inns at defending [[society]] itself  or  as  embodied  in  the  [[government]]  against  its internal or external enemies [[enemy]], overt or covert, [[present]] or future. ”
22	the conce pt o f the political
tice. basically, they provide a practical way of delimiting legal competences of cases within a [[state]] in its legal procedures. they  do not in the least aim at a general definition of the [[political]]. such definitions of the [[political]] suffice, therefore, for as long as  the [[state]] and the [[public]] [[institutions]] can be assumed as something self-evident and concrete. also, the general definitions of the [[political]] which contain nothing more than additional references to the [[state]] are understandable and to  that  extent  also  intellectually j ustifiable  for as long as the [[state]] is truly a clear and unequivr›cal eminent entity confronting nonpolitical groups and affairs—in other words, for  as long as the [[state]] possesses the [[monopoly]] on [[politics]].  that  was  the case where the [[state]] had either (as in the eighteenth century) not recognized [[society]] as an antithetical [[force]] or, at least (as  in  ger- many in the  nineteenth  century  and  into  the  twentieth),  stood above [[society]] as a stable and distinct [[force]].
the equation [[state]] = [[politics]] becomes  erroneous  and  decep- tive at exactly the moment when [[state]] and [[society]]  penetrate  each other. what had been up to  that  point  a9airs  of  [[state]]  become thereby social matters, and, [[vice]] versa, what had been purely social matters become affairs of state—as must necessarily occur in a dem- ocratically organized unit. heretofore ostensibly neutral domains— [[religion]], [[culture]], [[education]], the economy—then  cease  to  be  neutral in the sense that they do not perta in to [[state]] and to [[politics]]. as a polemical concept against such neutralizations and depoliticaliza-  tions of important domains appears the total [[state]], which potentially embraces every domain. this results in the identity of [[state]]  and [[society]]. in such a [[state]], therefore, everything is at least potentially [[political]], and in referring to the [[state]]  it  is  no longer  possible  to assert for it a specifically [[political]] characteristic.
[schmitt’s note]
the [[development]] can be  traced  from  the  absolute  [[state]]  of the eighteenth century via the neutral (noninter ventionist) state
the   concept   of the   political	*3
of the nineteenth to the total  [[state]]  c›f  the  twentieth.‘  [[democracy]] must do away with all the  typical  distinctions  and  depoliticaliza- tions characteristic ref the liberal ninetee nth century, also with those corresponding tc› the nineteeiath-century antitheses and divisions pertaining to the state-society ( = [[political]] against social) contrast, namely the followi ng, .i mong n u merous rather thorough ly  polemical and thereby agai n [[political]] antitheses:

religious as antithesis of [[political]] cultural	as antithesis of [[political]] economic as  antithesis  of  [[political]] legal	as antithesis of [[political]] scientific as antithesis of political

the more profound thinkers of the nineteenth cent ury sor›n recognized this. i n jacob hurck hardt’s wrlt geschichtliche betrach - fondrr (of  the  period  around  i sao)  the   following   sentences   are found on “democracy,  i.e.,  a  doctrine  nourished  by  a  thousand  springs, and varying greatly  with  the  social  status  of  its  adherents. only in  one  [[respect]]   was  it  consistent,   namely,   in   the   insatiability of its demand for [[state]] control of the [[individual]]. thus it blurs the boundaries between [[state]] and [[society]] and looks  to  the  [[state]]  for  the things that [[society]]  will  most  likely  refuse  to do,  while  maintaining a permanent condition of argument and [[change]] and ultimately vindicating the righ t  to  [[work]]  and  subsistence  for  [[certain]]  castes.” burck hardt  also  correctly  noted  the  inner  contradiction  of  democ-

tatively distinct from [[society]] and higher than it.  a  [[state]]  standing above [[society]] could  be  called  tmiversal  but  not  total,  as  that  term is understood nowadays, namely, as the polemical negatir›n of the neutral [[state]], whose economy and [[law]] were in themselves  nonpolit- ical. nevertheless, after  i 8q8,  the  qualitative  distinction  between [[state]] and [[society]] to which lorenz von stein and rudolf g neist still subscribed lost its previous clarity. notwithstanding [[certain]] limita- tions, reservations, and comprom ises, the [[development]] of germa n [[political]] [[science]], whose fundamental lines are  shown  in  my  treatise on preuss,’ follows the historical [[development]]  toward  the  demo- cratic identity of [[state]] and [[society]].
an interesting national-liberal intermediary stage is recogniz- able in the works [[work]] of albert haenel. “to generali ze  the  concept  of [[state]] altogether with the concept of h uman society” is, according to him, a “downright mistake.” he sees in the [[state]]  an  entity  joining other organizatir ns of [[society]] but of a “special  [[kind]]  which  rises  above these and is all embracing.” although its general [[purpose]] is universal, though only in the special task of delimiting  and  organ- izing socially effective forces [[force]], i.e., in the specific function of the [[law]], haenel considers [[wrong]] the [[belief]] that the [[state]] has, at least poten- tially, the [[power]] of making all the social goals of [[humanity]]  its goals too. even though the [[state]] is for him universal, it is by  no  mea ns  total.’ the decisive step is found in gier ke’s  theory  of  association (the first volume of his dan deutsche genossenschafisrecht appeared

in i 568) ,  because  it  conceives  of  the  [[state]]  as  one  association  [[equal]] to other associations. of course, in addition to the associational  ele- ments, [[sovereign]] ones too belonged to the [[state]] and were sometimes stressed more o nd sometimes  less.  but, since  it  pertained  to  a  theory of association and not to a theory of sovereignty of the [[state]], the democratic consequences were undeniable. i n germany,  they  were drawn  by  hugo  preuss  a nd   k.  wol zendorff,   whereas  in   [[england]]  it [[led]] to pluralist theories (see below, section q) .
while awa it ing further enlightenment, it seems to me that rudolf smend's theory  of  the  integration  of  the  [[state]]  corresponds to a [[political]] situation in which [[society]]  is  no longer  integrated  into an  existing  [[state]] (as  the  [[german]]  [[people]]  in  the  monarchical  [[state]] of the nineteenth century) but should itself integrate into  the [[state]]. that this situation  necessitates the total [[state]] is expressed most clearly
in smend’s remark about a sentence from h. tresc her’s i9t s disser- tation   on   montesquieu   and   hegel.'   there   it   is   sa id   of   hegel’s
doctrine of the division of powers [[power]] that it signifies “the most vigorous penetration of all societal spheres by the [[state]] for  the  general  pur- pose of [[win]] ning for the entirety of the [[state]] all vital energies of the [[people]].” to which smend adds that this is “precisely the integration theory” of his [[book]]. in actuality it is the total [[state]] which no longer knows [[know]] anything absolutely nonpolitical, the [[state]] which  must  do away with the depoliticalizations of the  nineteenth  century  and which in particular puts an end to the [[principle]] that the apolitical economy is independent of the [[state]] and  that  the [[state]] is apart  from the economy.



a definition of the [[political]] can be obtained only by discover- ing and defining the specifically [[political]] categories.  in  contrast  to the various  relatively  independent  endeavors  of  [[human]]  [[thought]] and

z6	the concept of the political
action, particularly the [[moral]], aesthetic, and economic,  the  [[political]] has its own criteria  which  express  themselves  in  a  characteristic way. the [[political]] must therefore rest on its own  ultimate  distinc- tions, to which all action with a specifically [[political]] mea ning ca n be traced. let us assume that in the realm of morality the final distinc- tions are between [[good]] and [[evil]], in aesthetics beautiful and ugly, in economics profitable a nd unprofitable. the [[question]] then is whether there is also a special distinction which can serve as a sim pie crite-  rion of the [[political]] a nd of what it consists. the [[nature]] of such a [[political]]  distinction  is  surely  different  from  that  of   those  others.  it is independent of them and as such cats speak clearly for itself.
the specific [[political]] distinction to which [[political]] actions and motives can be reduced is that between f rietid and [[enemy]].* this provides a defi nition in the sense of a criterion and not as  an exhaustive definition or one  indicative  of  substantial  content.{ insofar as it is not derived from other  c riteria,  the  antithesis  of  friend and [[enemy]] corresponds  to  the  relatively  independent  criteria of other antitheses: [[good]]  and  [[evil]]  in  the  [[moral]]  sphere,  beautiful  and ugly in the aesthetic sphere, and so on. in any event it is inde- pendent, not in the sense of  a  distinct  new  domain,  but  in  that  it can neither be based on any one a ntithesis or any  combination  of other antitheses, nor can it be traced to  these.  if  the  antithesis  of [[good]] and [[evil]] is  not  simply  identical  with  that  of  beautiful  and ugly, profitable and unprofitable, and cannot be  directly  reduced  to the others, then the antithesis  of  friend  and  [[enemy]]  must  even  less be confused with or mistaken  for  the  others.  the  distinction  of friend and [[enemy]] denotes the utmost  [[degree]] of  intensity  of  a  union or separation, of an association or dissociation. it can [[exist]] theo-
since schmitt identified himself with the epoch of the  national  sov- ereign [[state]] with its joj po6ficurit europaeiim, he used the term feind in  the [[enemy]] and not the foe sense.
i of the numerous discussions of schmitt’s friend-enemy criterion, particular attention is called  to  hans  morgenthau’s  la  noti’on  du “politi que” et  la  theorie   dev  di[ferends  internationaux   (paris:  sirey,   i 933)    pp    35 37.

retically  and  practically,  without  having  simultaneously  to   clraw  upon all those [[moral]], aesthetic, economic, or other distinctions. the [[political]] [[enemy]] need  not  be  morally  [[evil]]  or  aesthetically  ugly ;  he need not appear as :in economic competitor, and it may even be advantageous to engage with him in [[business]] transactions. but he is, nevertheless,  the  other,  the  stranger ;  and  it  is  sufficient  for  his [[nature]] that he is, in a specially intense way, existentially something different and a [[lie]] n, so  that  in  the  extreme  case  confi icts  with  him are  {possible.  the.se  can  neither  be  decided  by  a  previously  deter- m tried j;eneral norm nor by the [[judgment]] of a clisinterested a ted therefore neutra1 third part y.
only the actual {participants ca n correctly recr›gnize,  under- stand,  and  j udye  the  concrete  situation  and  settle  the  extreme   case of confl ict. each |aartici{aa nt is in a position to j udpe whether the adversary intends to negate his oppr›nent’s way of  [[life]]  and  therefr›re must be re{ ulsed r›r fought in order to preserve one’s own form of existence. kmr›tionally the [[enemy]] is easily treated as  being  [[evil]]  a nd ugly, beca use every distinction, most of  all  the  [[political]],  as  the strongest and most  intense  of  the  distinctions  and  categorizations, draws upon other distinctions for support. this does not a lter the autonomy  of  such  distinctions.  consecjuently,  the  reverse  is   also true: the morally [[evil]],  aesthetically  ugly  or  economically  damaging need not necessarily be the [[enemy]] ; the morally [[good]], aesthetically beautiful,  and  economically  profitable  need  not  necessarily   become the  friend  in  the  specifically  [[political]]   sense  of  the   word.  thereby the inherently objective  [[nature]]  and  autonomy  of  the  [[political]]  be- comes evident by [[virtue]] of its being able to treat, distinguish, and comprehend the friend-enemy antithesis independently  of  other antitheses.

cern here is neither with abstractions nr›r with normative ideals, but with inherent reality and the real possibility  of  such  a  distinction. one may or may not share these hopes [[hope]] and pedagogic ideals.



the  [[enemy]]  is  not  merely   any  competitor   or   just   any   partner  of  a  conflict  in  general.  he  is  also  not  the   private   adversary   whom one  hates.  an  [[enemy]]  exists  only  when,  at  least   potentially,   one  fighting  collectivity  of  [[people]]  confronts  a  similar   collectivity.   the [[enemy]] is solely the [[public]] [[enemy]],  because  everything  that  has  a relationship  to  such  a  collectivity  of  [[men]],  particularly  to   a   whole nation,  becomes  [[public]]  by   [[virtue]]  of   such   a   relationship.   the   [[enemy]] is ojf*i, not in im icu s in the broader sense ; jtoks[ttoq, not t2ilpñs.’
in his repuhlic (bk. v, ch. xvi. 47°) [[plato]] strongly emphasizes the contrast between the [[public]] [[enemy]] (nolsttto9) and the private one (t;(fipfiq), but in connection with the other antithesis of [[war]] (ftdlepo9) and insurrec-
the   conce pt  of the  political	*9
as [[german]] and other languages [[language]] do not  distinguish  between  the  private and [[political]] [[enemy]], many  misconceptions  and  falsifications are | ossible. the often c|ur›ted “love your  e ncmies”  (matt.  y:qq; luke 6:2j) reads “diligite inimicos vestros,” dyonfiit  sold  fzilpoé9 lqu›v, a nd not dillglt e hostes vestros. no me ntion is made of the [[political]] [[enemy]]. never in the thousa nd-year struggle between cih ris- tians and moslems did it occ ur to a  ch r istia n  to  [[surrender]]  rather than defend [[europe]] out of [[love]] toward the saracens or turks.  the [[enemy]] in the politica1 sense need  not  be  hated  [her sonally,  arid  in the private sphere only does it make sense to [[love]] one’s [[enemy]], i.e., one’s ad versary. the l3ible c} uotatir›n touches the [[political]] a ntithesis even less tha n it intends to dissolve, for [[example]],  the  antithesis  of [[good]] and [[evil]] or beautiful a nd ugly. i t certainly d‹›es not mean that one should [[love]] and support the enemies [[enemy]] of one’s own [[people]].
the [[political]] is the most intense and extreme antagonism, and every concrete antagonism becomes that much more [[political]] the closer it approaches the most extreme point, that of the friend-enemy grouping.   in   its  entirety   the  [[state]]  as  an   organized   [[political]] entity
tion, upheaval, rebellion, civil [[war]] (pitiptq) .• real [[war]] for [[plato]] is a  [[war]] between hellenes and barbarians only  (those  w ho are  “by  [[nature]] enemies”), w hereas con fiicts among hellenes are for him discords (ptd£ft tq).  the [[thought]] expressed here is that a [[people]] can not wage  [[war]]  against itself  and  a civ il [[war]] is onl y a self-laceration and it does not signify that perhaps  a new [[state]] or even a new [[people]] is being created. cited  mostly  for  the  âoi/ii con- cept is pomponius in the digest •fo, i6,  i i 8. the  most  clear-cut  defi nition with additional supporting material  is in  forcellini’s lexicon  totius latinimali›
(i q6$ ed.), ii, 684 : “a [[public]] [[enemy]] (hostis) is one  z ith  whom  we  are  at  [[war]] publicly.... in this [[respect]] he differs from  a  private  [[enemy]].  he  is  a [[person]]  with  whom  we  have  private quarrels. they may also be  distinguished
as follows: a private [[enemy]]  is a  [[person]]  who  hates  us, whereas  a  [[public]]  [[enemy]]  is a [[person]] who fights against us.”
stasis also means the exact opposite,  i.e.,  [[peace]]  and  order.  the  dia- lectic in hercnt in the term is pointed out by carl schmitt in politische theologle ii: [[die]] legendc von der erledigun g  jeder  polltische n  theologie (berlin : duncker ñ humblot, i9yo ), pp. i i y—i i 8.
3°	the   concept  of   the  political
decides  for  itself  the  friend-enemy   distinction.  furthermore,   next to the primary [[political]] decisions and under the protection of the decision taken, numerous secondary concepts of the  [[political]]  ema- nate. as to the equation  of  [[politics]] and  [[state]] discussed  under section i,  it nas  the effect, for  [[example]], of  contrasting  a  [[political]]  attitude of a [[state]] with party [[politics]] so that one can speak of a state’s domestic [[religious]], educational, communal, social policy, and so on. not- withstanding, the [[state]] encompasses and relativizes all these  an- titheses. however an antithesis and  antagonism  remain  here  within the state’s domain which have relevance for the concept of the [[political]]."  finally  even  more  banal  forms  of   [[politics]]  appear, forms

this becomes evident in daily [[speech]]  and  can  be exemplified by two obvious phenomena. first, all [[political]] concepts, images, and terms have a polemical meaning. they are focused on a  specific conflict and are bound to a concrete situation ; the result (which manifests itself in [[war]]  or  revolution)  is  a  friend-enemy  grouping, and they turn into empty and ghostlike abstractions when  this situa- tion disappears. words such as [[state]], [[republic]]," [[society]], class, as well
a social policy existed ever since a politically noteworthy class put forth its social demands; welfare [[care]], which in early times [[time]]  was administered to the [[poor]] and distressed, had not been considered a sociopolitical problem and was also not called such. likewise a [[church]] policy existed only where a [[church]] constituted a politically significant counterforce.
machiavelli, for [[example]], cal1s all nonmonarchical states republics [[republic]], and his definition is still accepted today. richard  thoma  defines [[democracy]] as a nonprivileged [[state]]; hence all nondemocracies are classifiecl as privileged states.

z ° n timerous forms an ti degrees [[degree]] of intensity  of  the  polemical  [[character]] are also here possible. but the essentially polern ical rl a ture of the politically charged terms and concepts rem a in nevertheless recognizable. terminolrigical questions [[question]] become thereby highly [[political]]. a word or expression can sim ul- taneously be reflex, signal, password,  n net  weapon  in  a  hostile  confrontation. for [[example]], karl ren ner, a socialist  of  the  second  i n ter national,  in  a  very sig nificant  sc holar i y pu blication, [[die]] techth nsti trite dcs privatrcchts (tubin- [[men]]: j. c. h.  mott r  [ paul siebeck] ,  i gz9), p.  9 j, call s  rent  w hich  the tenant
pays  the  i an elf ord  “tribute.”  most  [[german]]   professors  of   jurisprutlence,   j udges,
and la wycrs, woulcl consider such a clesignation  an  inal rn issible  politicaliza- tion of civil [[law]] rel at ions hips and would reject  this  on  the  grounds  that  it  would  rjisturb  the  purely  juristic,  purely   legal,  purely  scientific   discussion. for t hens the [[question]] h as been decided in a legal positivist [[man]] ner, and the therein  residing  [[political]]  clesign  of  the  [[state]]  is  th us  recognizecl.   on   the other hand, [[man]] y socialists of the second international  put  m uch  val ue  in calling the  pa yrnents  which  armed  [[france]]  imposes  upon  disarmed  cerm any not  “tribute,”  but  “reparations.”  “reparation”  appears  to  be   more   juristic, more  legal,  more  peaceful,  less  polemical,  and  more  apolitical  than  “tribute.” in  scrutinizing   this  more  closely,  however,  it  may  be  seen   that   “reparation” is  more  highly  charged  and  therefore  also  [[political]]  because  this  term  is utilized politically to condemn juristically and even  morally  the  vanquished [[enemy]]. the imposed payments have  the  effect  of  disqualif y ing  and  subjugat- ing  hint  not  onl y  legally  but  also  morally.  the   [[question]]   in  [[german]] y  today is whether one should say “tribute” or “reparation.” this  has  turned  into  an internal dispute.  in  previous  centuries  a  controversy  existed  between  the [[german]]  kaiser  (and  [[king]]  of  hungary)  and  the  turkish  sultan  on  the  ques- tion of whether the payments made  by  the  kaiser  to  the  sultan  were  in  the [[nature]] of a “pension” or “tribute.” the debtor stressed  that  he  did  not  [[pay]] “tribute”  but  “pension,”  whereas   the  creditor   considered   it   to  be   “tribute.” in the relations between  christians [[christian]]  and  turks  the  words  were  still  used  in  those days more openly  and  more  objectively,  and  the  juristic  concepts  per- haps had not yet become to the same extent as today [[political]] instruments of coercion. nevertheless,  bodin,  who  mentions  this  controversy  (lej  six  livres dc  la  rc publique,  [[paris]],  i •i8o,  p.  28q),  adds  that  in  most  instances “pension”

terrines the use of the word [[political]] regardless of whether the adversary is designated as nonpolitical (in the sense of harmless), or [[vice]] versa if one wants to disqualify or denounce him as [[political]] in order to portray oneself as nonpolitical (in the sense of purely scien- tific, purely [[moral]], p urely juristic, purely aesthetic, purely economic, or on the basis of similar purities) and thereby superior.
secondly, in usual domestic polemics the word [[political]]  is today often used interchangeably with party [[politics]]. the inevitable lack of objectivity in [[political]] decisions, which is only the reflex to suppress the politically inherent friend-enemy antithesis, manifests itself in the regrettable forms and aspects of the scramble for office and the [[politics]] of patronage. the  demand for  depoliticalization which arises in this context means only the rejection of party [[politics]], etc. the equation [[politics]] = party [[politics]] is possible whenever antagonisms among domestic [[political]] parties succeed in weakening the all-embracing [[political]] unit, the [[state]]. the intensification of internal antagonisms has the effect of weakening  the  [[common]] identity vis-a-vis another [[state]]. if domestic conflicts among [[political]] parties have become the sole [[political]] difference, the most extreme [[degree]] of internal [[political]] tension is thereby reached; i.e., the domestic, not the [[foreign]] friend-and-enemy  groupings  are  decisive for armed conflict. the ever [[present]] possibility of  conflict  must always be kept in [[mind]]. if one wants to speak of [[politics]] in  the context of the primacy of internal [[politics]], then  this conflict  no longer refers to [[war]] between organized nations but to civil [[war]].
for to the [[enemy]] concept belongs  the ever  [[present]]  possibility of combat. all peripherals must be left aside from this term, in- cluding [[military]] details and the [[development]] of [[weapons]] technology. [[war]] is armed combat between organized  [[political]] entities ; civil  [[war]]  is armed combat within an organized unit. a self-laceration en- dangers the sur vival of the latter. the essence of a weapon is that
is paid not to [[protect]] oneself from other enemies [[enemy]], but primarily from the protector himself and to ransom oneself from an [[invasion]] (pour se rachcter de f’inunjioa) .
the    concept  of the  political	-‘l3
it is a means of physically killing [[human]] beings. just as the term [[enemy]], the word combat, too, is to be understood  in  its  origin al existential  sense.  it  does  not  mean  competition,  nor  does  it   mean pure intellectual controversy nor symbolic wrest lings iii which, after all, every [[human]] being is somehow always involved, for  it is a fact
that  the entire  [[life]] of  a  [[human]]  bei ng is  a struggle  a net  every  human
being sy mbolically a combatant. the friend, cnemy, and combat concepts  receive  their  real  meaning  precisely   because   they refer  to the  real  possibility  of  physical  killing.  [[war]]   follows  from  enmity. [[war]] is the existential negation of the [[enemy]].* it is the most ext reme consequence of enmity. it does not have to be [[common]], normal, something ideal, or desirable. but it must  nevertheless remain a real possibility  for  as long as the  concept  ref  the  enena y remains valid. it is by no means as though the [[political]] signifies nothi rig but devastating [[war]] and every [[political]]  deed  a  [[military]]  action,  by  n‹a means as though every nation would be uninterruptedly f aced with the  friend-enemy  alternative  vis-a-vis  every  other   nation. and,  after all, could not the politically reasonable course reside in avoiding war!  the  definition  of  the  [[political]]   suggested   here neither   favors [[war]] nor militarism, neither imperialism nor pacifism. nor is it an attempt to idealize the victorious  [[war]] or the successful [[revolution]] as a  “social  ideal,”  since  neither  [[war]]  nor  [[revolution]] is  something social or something ideal.' 3 the [[military]] [[battle]] itself is not the
* schmitt clearly alludes here to the foe concept in [[politics]].
"  rudolf  stamml er’s  thesis,  w hich  i.s  rooted   in   neo-kantian   [[thought]], that the “social ideal” is the  “community  of  [[free]]  willing  individuals”  is  con- tradicted by erich kaufmann  in  das  wesen  des  vol)errechts  und  [[die]]  clauiiilu rebus  sic  stantibus  (tubingen :  j.  c.  b.  mohr  [paul  siebeck) ,   91 i) ,   .   iq6,  who maintains that “not the  [[community]]  of  [[free]]  willing  individuals [[individual]],  but  the victorious [[war]]  is  the  social  ideal:  the  victorious  [[war]]  as  the  [[last]]  means  toward  that  lofty  goal”  (the  participation  and  self-assertion  of  the  [[state]]   in   worlci history).  this  sentence  incorporates  the  typical  neo-kantian  liberal  notion  of “social ideal.” but wars [[war]], including victorious wars [[war]], are something completely incommensurable and incompatible with this  conception.  this  [[idea]]  is  then joined to the notion of the victorious [[war]], which has its habitat in the
34	the concept of the political
“continuation of [[politics]] by other means” as the famous term of clausewitz is generally incorrectly cited.“ [[war]] has its own strategic, tactical, and other rules [[rule]] and points of view, but they  all  presuppose that the [[political]] decision has already been made as to who the [[enemy]] is. in [[war]] the adversaries most often confront each other openly ; normally they are identifiable by a uniform, and the distinction  of friend and [[enemy]] is therefore no  longer  a  [[political]]  problem  which the fighting soldier has  to solve. a  british  diplomat  correctly  stated in this context that the politician is [[better]] schooled for  the [[battle]] than the soldier, because the politician fights his whole [[life]] whereas the soldier does so  in  exceptional  circumstances  only.  [[war]]  is  neither the aim nor the [[purpose]] nor even the very content of  [[politics]].  but  as an ever [[present]] possibility it is the leading presupposition which determines in a characteristic way [[human]] ac:ion and thin [[king]] and thereby creates a specifically [[political]] behavior.
the  criterion  of   the  friend-and-enemy  distinction  in  no way
implies that  one  particular  nation  must  forever  be  the  friend  or [[enemy]]  of   another  specific  nation  or  that  a  [[state]]  of   neutrality  is  not
hegelian-rankian [[philosophy]] of [[history]], in which social ideals do not [[exist]]. the antithesis which appear s at first glance to be striking thus breaks  into  two disparate parts, and the rhetorical [[force]] of a thunderous contrast can neither veil the structural incoherence nor heal the intellectual breach.
'• carl  von clausewitz  ( fottt  kriege, zn.d ed.  [ berlin:  ferd. dumm-
lers verlagsñuchandlung, *53] vol. i ii, part ii i, p. i zo) says: “war is nothing  but a continuation  of  [[political]]  intercourse  with  a  mixture  of other
means.” [[war]] is for him a “mere instrument of [[politics]].” this  cannot  be denied, but its meaning for the understanding of the essence of [[politics]] is thereby still not exhe usted. to be precise, [[war]], for clausewitz, is not merely one of many instruments, but the ii/?itna ratio of the friend-and-enemy group- ing. [[war]] has its own grammar (i.e., special military-technical laws),  but [[politics]] remains its brain. it does not have its own [[logic]]. this can only be tlerived from the friend-and-enemy concept, and the sentence on page i z i reveals this core of [[politics]]: “if [[war]] belongs to [[politics]], it will thereby assume its [[character]]. the more grandiose and powerful it becomes, so will also the [[war]], and this may be carried to the point at which [[war]] reaches its absolute form. ”

possible or could not be politically reasonable. as with every [[political]] concept, the neutrality concept too is [[subject]] to the ultimate pre- supposition of a real possibility of a friend-and-e nemy grouping. should only neutrality {prevail in the [[world]], then not only  [[war]]  but also neutrality would come to an end. the [[politics]] of avoiding [[war]] terminates, as does all [[politics]], whenever the possibility of fighting disappears. what alwa ys matters is the possibility  of  the extreme case taking place, the real wir, and the decision  whether  this situa- tion has or has not arrived.
that the extreme case appears to be an exception does not negate its decisive [[character]] but confirms it all the more. to  the extent that wars [[war]] tod:iy have decreased in  n umber  and  frequency, they have proportionately increased in ferocity. [[war]] is still today the most extreme possibility. one can say  that  the exceptional case has an especially decisive meaning which exposes the core of the matter. for only in real comb:it  is  revealed  the  most extreme consequence of the [[political]] grouping of friend and [[enemy]]. from this most ex- treme possibility [[human]]  [[life]] derives its specifically [[political]] tension. a [[world]] in which the possibility of [[war]] is utterly eliminated,
a completely pacified globe, would be a [[world]] without the distinction of friend and [[enemy]] a nd hence a [[world]] without [[politics]]. it is con- ceivable that such a [[world]] might contain many very interesting antitheses and contrasts, competitions and intrigues  o(  every  [[kind]], but there would not be a  meaningful  antithesis  whereby  [[men]] could be required to [[sacrifice]] [[life]], authorized to shed [[blood]], and kill other [[human]] beings. for the definition of the [[political]], it is here even irrelevant whether such a [[world]] without [[politics]] is desirable as an  ideal situation. the phenomenon of the [[political]] can be understood only in the context of the ever [[present]] possibility of the friend-and- [[enemy]] grouping, regardless of the aspects which this possibility implies for morality, aesthetics, and economics.
war as the most extreme [[political]] means discloses the possi- bility which underlies  every  [[political]]  [[idea]],  namely,  the  distinction of friend and [[enemy]]. this makes sense only as long as this distinc-
$6	the conce pt of the political
tion in [[mankind]] is actually [[present]]  or at least  potentially  possible.  on the other hand, it would be senseless to wage [[war]] for purely [[religious]], purely [[moral]], purely juristic, or purely economic motives. the friend-and-enemy grouping and therefore also [[war]] ca nnot be derived from these specific antitheses of [[human]]  endeavor.  a  [[war]] need be neither something  [[religious]] nor  something  morally  [[good]] nor something lucrative. [[war]] today is in all likelihood none of these. this obvious point is mostly confused by the [[fact]] that  [[religious]], [[moral]], a nd other antitheses can intensify to [[political]] ones and can bring about the decisive friend-or-enemy constellation.  if,  in  [[fact]],  this occurs, then the relevant antithesis is no longer purely [[religious]], [[moral]], or economic, but [[political]]. the  sole  remaining  [[question]]  then is always whether such a friend-and-enemy grouping is really  at  hand, regardless of which [[human]] motives are sufhciently [[strong]] to have brought it about.
nothing can  escape  this  logical  conclusion of  the  [[political]]. if pacifist hostility toward [[war]] were so [[strong]] as  to drive  pacifists  into a [[war]] against non pacifists, in a [[war]] against [[war]],  that  would prove that pacifism truly possesses [[political]] energy because it is supiciently [[strong]] to group [[men]] according to friend  and  [[enemy]].  if,  in [[fact]], the will to abolish [[war]] is so [[strong]] that  it  no  longer  shuns [[war]], then it has become a [[political]] motive, i.e., it afhrms, even if only as an extreme possibility, [[war]] and even the [[reason]] for [[war]]. presently this appears to be a peculiar way of justifying wars [[war]]. the [[war]] is then considered to  constitute  the  absolute  [[last]]  [[war]]  of   [[humanity]].  such a [[war]] is necessarily unusually intense and inhuman because, by transcending the limits of the [[political]] framework, it simultaneously degrades the [[enemy]] into [[moral]] and other categories and is forced to make of him a monster that must not only be defeated  but  also  utterly destroyed. in other words, he is an  [[enemy]]  who  no  longer must be compelled to retreat into  his  borders  only.•  the  feasibility of such [[war]] is particularly illustrative of the [[fact]] that [[war]] as a real

possibility is still [[present]] today, and this [[fact]] is crucial for the friend- and-enemy antithesis and for the recognition of [[politics]].

every [[religious]], [[moral]], economic, ethical, or other antithesis transforms into a [[political]] one if  it  is  sufhciently  [[strong]]  to  group [[human]] beings effectively according to friend and [[enemy]]. the [[political]] doe5 not reside in the battlc itself, whick possesses its ow'n technical, psychological, and militar y laws [[law]], but  i n  the  mode  of  behavior  which is determined by this possibility, by clearly evaluating the concrete situation and  thereby  being  able  to  distinguish  correctly  the  real friend and the real [[enemy]]. a [[religious]] [[community]] which wages wars [[war]] against members of other [[religious]] commute ities or engages  in  other wars [[war]] is already more than a  [[religious]]  [[community]] ;  it  is  a  [[political]] entity. it is a [[political]] entity when it possesses,  even  if  only  nega-  tively, the capacity of promoting that decisive step, when it is in the position of forbidding its members to participate in wars [[war]],  i.e.,  of decisively denying the [[enemy]]  equality  of  a  [[certain]]  adversary.  the same holds true for an association of individuals [[individual]] based on economic interests  as,  for  [[example]],  an  industrial  concern  or  a  labor  union. also a class in the mar xian sense ceases to be something purely  economic and becomes a [[political]] factor when it reaches this decisive point, for [[example]], when marxists approach  the  class  struggle  seri- ously and treat the class adversary as a  real  [[enemy]]  and  fights  him  either in the form of a [[war]] of [[state]]  against  [[state]]  or  in  a  civil  [[war]]  within a [[state]]. the real [[battle]] is then of necessity no longer fought according  to  economic  laws [[law]]  but  has—next  to  the  fighting   methods in the narrowest technical sense—its [[political]] necessities and orienta- tions, coalitions and compromises, and so on. should the proletariat succeed in seizing [[political]] [[power]] within  a  [[state]],  a  proletarian  [[state]]  will thus have been created. this [[state]]  is  by  no  means  less  of  a [[political]] [[power]] than a national [[state]], a theocratic, mercantile, or

soldier [[state]], a civil service [[state]], or some other type  of [[political]] entity. were it possible to group all [[mankind]] in the proletarian and bourgeois antithesis, as friend and [[enemy]] in proletarian and capitalist states, and if, in the process, all other friend-and-enemy  groupings were to disappear, the total reality of the [[political]] would then be revealed, insofar  as  concepts,  which  at  first  glance  had  appeared  to be purely economic, turn into [[political]] ones. if the [[political]]  [[power]] of a class or of some other group within  a  [[state]]  is  sufficiently  [[strong]] to hinder the waging of  wars [[war]] against other states but incapable of assuming or lacking the will to assume the state’s [[power]] and  thereby decide on the friend-and-enemy distinction and, if necessary, make [[war]], then the [[political]] entity is destroyed.
the [[political]] can derive its energy from  tne  most  varied [[human]] endeavors, from the [[religious]], economic, [[moral]], and other antitheses. it does not describe its own substance, but only the intensity of an association or dissociation of [[human]] beings whose motives can be [[religious]], national (in the ethnic or cultural sense) , economic, or of another [[kind]] and can effect at different times [[time]] dif- ferent coalitions and separations. the real friend-enemy grouping is existentially so [[strong]] and  decisive  that  the  nonpolitical  antithesis, at precisely the moment at which it becomes [[political]], pushes  aside and subordinates its hitherto purely [[religious]],  purely  economic, purely cultural criteria and motives to the  conditions  and  conclu- sions of the [[political]]  situation  at  hand. in  any  event, that  grouping  is always [[political]] which orients itself toward this most extreme possibility. this grouping is therefore always the decisive [[human]] grouping, the [[political]] entity. if such an entity exists at all,  it  is  always the decisive entity, and it is [[sovereign]] in the sense that the decision about the critical situation, even if it is the exception, must always necessarily reside there.
a valid meaning is here  attached to  the  word  sovereignty, just as to the term entity. both do not at all imply that a  [[political]] entity must necessarily determine every aspect of a person’s  [[life]] or that a centralized [[system]] should [[destroy]] every other organization or
the   conce pt  of  the   political	?9
corporation.* it  may  be  that  econom ie  considerations  can  be  stronger than  a nything  [[desired]]  by   a   [[government]]   which   is  ostensibly   indiffer ent toward  economics.  likewise,  [[religious]]  convictions  can  easily determine the [[politics]] of  an  alleged ly  ne ut ral  [[state]].  wh ‹it  al ways matters is only the {aossibi lity of con fiict. if, in  [[fact]],  the  eco nomic, cultural, r›r [[religious]] con n terf or ces are so [[strong]] that  they  are  in  a position  to  decide  u)ac› n  the  extreme  }›ossibility  from  their   vie w- point,  then  these  forces [[force]]  have  in  actuality   become   the   new  substa rice  of the [[political]] entity.  it  would  be  a n  indicatiran  that  these  counter-  forces [[force]]  had  not  reached  the  decisive  point  in   the   [[political]]   if   they turned  out  to  be  not  sufficiently   po we rf ul  to  prevent  a  [[war]]  contrar y to  their  interests  r›r  princi[ les.  should  the  counterforces  be  [[strong]] enough  to  hinder  a  [[war]]  [[desired]]  by   the   [[state]]   that   was   contrary   to their interests or principles [[principle]] but not sufficiently capable  themselves  of deciding  about  [[war]],  then  a  unified  [[political]]  entity   would   no  longer [[exist]].  however  one  may  look  at  it,  in  the  orientation  toward   the possible extreme case of  an  actual  [[battle]]  against  a  real  [[enemy]],  the [[political]] en tity is essential, and it is the decisive entity for the f riend- or-enemy  grouping;  and  in  this  (and  not  in  any  [[kind]]  of   absolutist sense),   it   is   [[sovereign]].   otherwise   the   [[political]]   entity   is   nonexistent.
when the [[political]] significance of domestic economic associ- ations had been recognized, in particu1;ir the [[growth]] of labor unions, the laws [[law]] of the [[state]] appeared quite [[power]] less against their economic weapon, the strike. consequently, some have somewhat hastily pro- claimed the [[death]] and the end of the [[state]]. as far as i can tell this emerged as a doctrine of the french sy ndicalists after  i po6  and i9oy.“  duguit  is  in   this  context  the  [[best]]  known  [[political]]  theorist.

that the [[state]] is an entity and in [[fact]] the decisive entity rests upon its [[political]] [[character]].  a  pluralist  theory  is  either  the  theory of [[state]] which arrives at the unity of [[state]] by a federalism of social associations or a theory of  the  dissolution  or  rebuttal  of  the [[state]]. if, in [[fact]], it challenges the entity and places the [[political]] association on an [[equal]] level with the others, for [[example]], [[religious]] or economic associations, it must, above all, [[answer]] the [[question]] as to the specific content of the [[political]]. although in his numerous  books [[book]]  laski speaks of [[state]], [[politics]], sovereignty, and [[government]], one does not find in these a specific definition of the [[political]]. the [[state]] simply transforms itself into an association which competes with other associations; it becomes a [[society]] among some other societies [[society]] which [[exist]] within or outside the [[state]]. that  is the pluralism  of  this theory of [[state]]. its entire ingenuity is directed  against earlier  exaggerations of the [[state]], against its majesty and  its personality,  against  its claim to possess the [[monopoly]] of the highest unity, while  it  remains unclear what, according to this pluralist theory of [[state]], the [[political]] entity should be. at times [[time]] it appears in its  old  liberal  form,  as  a mere servant of the essentially economically determined [[society]], at times [[time]] pluralistically as a distinct type of [[society]], that is, as one asso- ciation among other associations, at times [[time]] as the product of a federalism of social associations or an umbrella association of a conglomeration of associations. above all, it  has  to  be  explained why [[human]] beings should have to form  a governmental  association in addition to the [[religious]], cultural, economic, and other associa- tions, and what would be its specific [[political]] meaning.  no  clear chain of [[thought]] is discernible here. what appears finally is an all-embracing, monistically global, and by no means pluralist con- cept, namely cole’s “society” and laski’s “humanity.”
the pluralist theory of [[state]] is in itself  pluralistic,  that  is, it  has no center but draws its thoughts [[thought]] from rather different intel-  lectual circles (religion, economics, liberalism, socialism, etc.). it
the concept oj the political	45
ignores the central concept of every theory of [[state]], the [[political]], and does not even mention the possibility that the pluralism of associa- tions could lead to a federally constructed [[political]] entity. it totally revolves in a  libera1 individualism.  the  result  is  nothing  else  than a revocable service for individuals [[individual]] and their [[free]] associations. one association is played off against another and all c}uestions and coi- flicts are decided by individuals [[individual]]. in reality there exists no [[political]] [[society]] or association but only one [[political]] entity—one [[political]] [[community]]. the ever [[present]] possibility of a friend-and-enemy gr‹ruping sufhces to forge a clecisive entit y which transcends  the mere societal-associational groupings. the [[political]] entity is some- thing specifically different, and vis-a-vis other associations, something decisive." were this entity to  disappear,  even  if  only  potentially, then the [[political]] itsclf  would  disappear.  only  as  long  as  the essence of the [[political]] is not comprehended or not taken into consideration is it possible to place a [[political]] association pluralisti- cally on the same level with [[religious]], cultural, economic, or other associations and permit it to compete with  these. as we shall attempt to show below (section 6), the concept of the [[political]] yields plural- istic consequences, but not in the sense  that,  within  one  and  the same [[political]] entity, instead of the decisive friend-and-enemy group- ing, a pluralism could take its  place  without  destroying  the  entity and the [[political]] itself.



to the [[state]] as an essentially [[political]]  entity  belongs  the  yet belli, i.e., the real possibility of deciding  in  a  concrete  situation  upon the [[enemy]] and the  ability  to  [[fight]]  him  with  the  [[power]]  emanating from the entity. as long as a politically [[united]] [[people]] is prepared

to [[fight]] for its  existence,  independence,  and  [[freedom]]  on  the  basis of a decision emanating from the [[political]] entity, this specifically [[political]] [[question]] has primacy over the  technical  means  by  which the [[battle]] will be waged, the [[nature]] of the army’s organization, and what the prospects are for winning the [[war]]. the [[development]] of [[military]] techniques appears to move in a direction  which  will perhaps permit only a few states to survive, i.e., those whose indus- [[trial]] potential would allow them to wage a promising [[war]]. should smaller and weaker states be unable to maintain  their  independence by [[virtue]] of an appropriate [[alliance]], they may then be forced, volun- tarily or by necessity, to abdicate the /oi belli. this  [[development]] would still not prove that [[war]], [[state]], and [[politics]]  will  altogether  cease. the numerous  changes [[change]]  and  revolutions [[revolution]]  in  [[human]]  [[history]] and [[development]] have produced new forms and dimensions of [[political]] groupings. previously existing [[political]] structures were de- stroyed, new kinds [[kind]] of [[foreign]]  and  civil  wars [[war]] arose, and  the number of organized [[political]] entities soon increased or diminished.
the [[state]] as the decisive [[political]] entity possesses an enormous [[power]]: the possibility of waging [[war]] and thereby  publicly disposing  of the lives [[life]] of [[men]]. the jet belli contains such a disposition.  it implies a double possibility: the [[right]] to demand from its own members the readiness to [[die]] and  unhesitatingly  to  kill  enemies [[enemy]]. the endeavor of a normal [[state]] consists above all in assuring total [[peace]] within the [[state]] and its territory. to create  tranquility,  secu- rity, and order and thereby establish the normal situation is the prerequisite for legal norms to be valid. every norm presupposes a normal situation, and no norm can be valid in an entirely abnormal situation.
as  long  as  the  [[state]]  is  a  [[political]]  entity   this  requirement  for
internal [[peace]] compels it in critical  situations  to decide  also  upon the domestic [[enemy]]. every [[state]] provides, therefore, some [[kind]] of formula for the declaration of an internal [[enemy]]. the no\ettvog declaration  in  the [[public]]  [[law]]  of  the [[greek]]  republics [[republic]]  and  the hostis
the conce pt of the political	47
declaration in roman  [[public]]  [[law]]  are  but  two  examples [[example]].  whether the form is shar{ er or milder, explicit or implicit, whether ostracism, expulsion, proscription, or out lawry are  provided for in special  laws [[law]] or in explicit or gencr:i1 descriptions, the a inn is always the same, namely to declare an [[enemy]].  that,  depending  on  the  attitude  of those who had  been  declared  enem res of [[state]], is  possibly  the  sign of civil [[war]], i.e., the dissolution of the [[state]] as an organized [[political]] entity, internally peacef u1,  territorially  enclosed,  anal  impenetrable to aliens. the civil [[war]] then decides the further [[fate]] of  this  entity. more so than for other states, this is particularly valid for a consti- tutional  [[state]],  despite  all  the  constitutional  ties  to  which  the  [[state]] is bound. in a constitutional [[state]], as lorenz von stein says, the [[constitution]] is  “the  expression  of  the  societal  order,  the  existence of [[society]] itself. as soon as it is attacked the [[battle]]  must  then  be waged outside the [[constitution]] and the [[law]], hence decided  by  the [[power]] of [[weapons]].” *
the  [[authority]]  to decide, in  the  form  of  a  verdict  on  [[life]] and
death, the jet ei/ae ac necis, can  also  belong to  another  non [[political]] order within the [[political]] entity, for instance,  to  the  [[family]]  or  to  the head of the household, but  not  the  [[right]]  of  a  norris  declaration  as  long as  the  [[political]]  entity  is  an  actuality  and  possesses  the  /oi belli. if a [[political]] entity  exists  at  all,  the  [[right]]  of  vendettas  between families [[family]]  or kinsfolk  would  have  to  be  suspended  at  least  tempo- rarily during a [[war]]. a [[human]] group which renounces these  conse- quences of a [[political]] entity ceases to be a [[political]] group, because it thereby renounces  the  possibility  of  deciding   whom  it  considers   to be the [[enemy]] and how he should be  treated.  by  [[virtue]]  of  this  [[power]] over the physical [[life]] of [[men]], the [[political]]  [[community]]  transcends  all other associations or societies [[society]]. within the [[community]], however, sub- ordinate   groupings  of   a  secondary   [[political]]   [[nature]]   could   [[exist]] with

a [[religious]] [[community]], a [[church]],  can  exhort  a  member  to [[die]] for his [[belief]] and become a martyr, but only for  the salvation  of  his own [[soul]], not for the [[religious]] [[community]] in its quality as an earthly [[power]]; otherwise it assumes a [[political]] dimension. its  holy wars [[war]] and crusades are actions which presuppose an [[enemy]] decision, just as do other wars [[war]]. under no circumstances  can  anyone  demand that any member of an economically  determined  [[society]],  whose order in the economic domain is based upon [[rational]] procedures, [[sacrifice]] his [[life]] in the interest  of  [[rational]] operations. to  justify  such a demand on the basis of econ omic expediency would contradict the individualistic principles [[principle]] of a liberal  economic  order  and  could never be justified by the norms or ideals of an economy auton- omously conceived. the [[individual]] may voluntarily  [[die]]  for  what- ever [[reason]] he may [[wish]]. that is, like everything in an essentially individualist liberal [[society]], a thoroughly private matter—decided upon freely.
the economically functioning [[society]] possesses sufficient means to neutralize nonviolently, in a “peaceful” [[fashion]], those economic competitors who are inferior, unsuccessful or mere “perturbers.” concretely speaking, this implies that this competitor will be left to starve if he does not voluntarily accommodate himself. a purely cultural or civilized [[system]] of [[society]]  will  not lack social indications to rid itself of  unwanted  perturbations  or  unwanted  additions.  but no program, no ideal, no norm, no expediency confers a [[right]] to dispose of the physical [[life]] of other [[human]] beings. to demand seriously of [[human]] beings that they  kill others  and  be  prepared  to [[die]] themselves so that [[trade]] and industry may flourish for the  survivors or that  the purchasing  [[power]]  of  grandchildren  may  grow is sinister and crazy. it is a manifest fraud to condemn [[war]] as  homicide and then demand of [[men]] that they wage [[war]], kill and be killed, so that there will never again be [[war]]. [[war]], the readiness of combatants to [[die]], the physical killing of [[human]] beings who belong

on the side of the enemy—all this has no normative meaning, but an existential meaning only, particularly in a  real combat  situation  with a real [[enemy]]. there exists no [[rational]] [[purpose]], no norm  no  matter how true, no program no matter how exemplary, no social ideal no matter how beautiful, no legitimacy nor legality which could justity [[men]] in killing each other for this [[reason]]. if  such  physical  destruc- tion of [[human]] [[life]] is not motivated by an existential threat  to one’s own way of [[life]], then it cannot be justified. just as little can [[war]] be justified by ethical and juristic norms. if there  really  are enemies [[enemy]] in the existential sense as meant here, then it is justified, but only politically, to repel and [[fight]] them physically.
that [[justice]] does not belong to the concept of [[war]] has been generally recognized since grotius.20 the notions which postulate a  just [[war]] usually serve a [[political]] [[purpose]]. to demand of a politically [[united]] [[people]] that it wage [[war]] for a just cause only is either some- thing self-evident, if it means that [[war]] can be risked only against  a real [[enemy]], or it is a hidden [[political]] aspiration  of  some  other  party to wrest from the [[state]] its yet belli and to find norms of [[justice]] whose content and application in the concrete case is not decided  upon  by the [[state]] but by another party, and thereby it determines who  the [[enemy]] is. for as long as a [[people]] exists in the [[political]] sphere, this [[people]] must, even if only in the  most  extreme  case—and  whether this point has been reached has to be decided by it—determine  by itself the distinction of friend and [[enemy]]. therein  resides the essence of its [[political]] existence. when it no longer possesses the capacity or the will to make this distinction, it ceases to [[exist]] politically. if it permits this decision to be made by another, then it is no longer a politically [[free]] [[people]] and is absorbed into another [[political]] [[system]]. the justification of [[war]] does not  reside in its being fought for  ideals or norms of [[justice]], but in its being fought against a real [[enemy]]. all

confusions  of  this category  of  friend  and [[enemy]]  can  be explained as
results of bleedings of some sort of abstractions or norms.
a [[people]] which exists in the sphere of the [[political]] cannot in case of need renounce the [[right]] to determine by itself the friend-and- [[enemy]]  distinction.   it  can  solemnly  declare   that  it  condemns   [[war]]  as a means of solving international disputes  and  can  renounce  it  as  a means of national policy, as was done in the so-called kellogg pact
of   1928.z'   in  so  doing  it  has  neither   repudiated   [[war]]   as  an instru-
ment of international [[politics]] (and a [[war]] as an instrument of inter- national [[politics]] can be worse than a [[war]] as an instrument of  a  na- tional policy only)  nor  condemned  nor  outlawed  [[war]]  altogether. such a declaration is [[subject]], first of all, to specific reservations which are explicitly or implicitly self-understood as, for [[example]], the reservation regarding the autonomous existence of the [[state]] and its self-defense,  the  reservation  regarding  existing  treaties,  the  [[right]]  o( a continuing [[free]] and  independent  existence,  and  so  on.  second, these  reservations  are,  according  to  their  logical  structure,  no  mere

systematic treatment, not even there where explicit  treatments  mention  the  [[sanctity]] of treaties and the sentence pacta sunt servan da. to fill this gap a noteworthy beginning is to be found in carl bilfinger, “betrachtungen iiber politisches  recht,”   zeitschri ft   fiir  auslandisch•      b••!!•’•ltei   recht   und vol-

exceptions to the norm, but altogether give the norm its concrete content. they are not peripheral but essential  exceptions;  they  give the treaty its real content in dubious cases. third, as long as  a [[sovereign]] [[state]] exists, this [[state]] decides for itself, by [[virtue]] of its independence, whether or  not  such  a  reservation  (self-defense, [[enemy]] aggression, violation of  existing  treaties  including  the  kellogg pact, and so on) is or is not given in  the  concrete  case. fourth, [[war]] cannot altogether be outlawed, but only specific indi- viduals, peoples [[people]], states, classes, religions [[religion]], etc., which, by being out- lawed, are declared to be the [[enemy]]. the solemn declaration of out- lawing [[war]] does not  abolish  the  friend-enemy  distinction,  but,  on the contrary, opens new  possibilities  by  giving  an  international goi/ii declaration new content and new vigor.
were this distinction to vanish then [[political]]  [[life]]  would  van- ish altogether. a [[people]] which exists in the [[political]] sphere cannot, despite entreating declarations to the contrary, escape  from  making this fateful distinction. if  a  part  of  the  [[population]]  declares  that  it no longer recognizes  enemies [[enemy]],  then, depending  on  the circumstance, it joins their side and aids them. such a declaration does not abolish  the reality of the friend -and-enemy distinction. quite another ques- tion concerns [[citizens]] of a [[state]] who  declare  that  they  personally have no enemies [[enemy]]. a private [[person]] has no [[political]] enemies [[enemy]]. such a declaration can at most say that he would  like  to  place  himself outside the [[political]] [[community]]  to  which  he  belongs  and  continue to [[live]] as a private [[individual]] only.2' furthermore, it would be  a mistake to [[believe]] that a nation could eliminate the distinction  of friend and [[enemy]] by declaring its [[friendship]] for the entire world

[schmitt’s  note]
on this [[principle]] rests the feudal order  and  the  relation  of  [[lord]] and vassal, leader and [[led]], patron a nd clients. this relation is clearly and explicitly seen here. no form of order, no reasonable legitimacy or legality can [[exist]] without protection  and  [[obedience]].  the protego er go obligo is the rogi/o ergo so m of the [[state]]. a polit- ical theory which does not systematically become aware of this sentence remains an inadequate  fragment.  hobbes  designated  this (at the end of his english edition of i65 i, p. 3q6) as  the  true  pur- pose of his m viathan, to instill in [[man]] once again “the  mutual relation between protection and  obedience” ; [[human]]  [[nature]]  as well as [[divine]] [[right]] demands its inviolable observation.
hobbes himself had experienced this [[truth]]  in  the  terrible times [[time]] of civil [[war]], because then all legitimate and  normative  illu- sions with which [[men]] like to [[deceive]] themselves regarding [[political]] realities in periods of untroubled security vanish. if within the [[state]] there are organized parties capable of according their members more protection than the [[state]], then  the  latter  becomes  at  [[best]]  an  annex of such parties, and the individua i citizen k mows whom he has to obey. as has been shown (under section q above),  a  pluralistic theory of [[state]] can justify this. the fundamental correctness of the protection-obedience axiom comes to the fore even more clearly in [[foreign]] policy and interstate relations:  the  simplest  expression  of this axiom is found in the protectorate under international [[law]], the

it would be ludicrous to [[believe]] that a defense less [[people]] has nothing b ut [[friends]],  and  it  would  be  a  deranged  calculation  to su[opose  that  the  [[enemy]]  cou id  perhaps  be  touched  by   the  absence of a [[resistance]]. no one thinks [[think]] it possible that the [[world]] could,  for [[example]], be transformed into a condition of pure morality by the renunciation   of   every   aesthetic  or  economic   productivity.   even less

the [[political]] entity presupposes the  real existence of  an [[enemy]]  and  therefore  coexistence   with   another   [[political]]   entity.  as   long  as a [[state]] exists, there will thus  always  be  in  the  [[world]]  more  than  j ust one [[state]]. a [[world]] [[state]] which embraces the entire globe and all of [[humanity]] can not [[exist]]. the [[political]] [[world]] is  a  pluriverse,  not  a [[universe]].  in  this  sense  every  theory  of  [[state]]  is  pluralistic,  even though in a diflerent way from the domestic  theory  of  pluralism discussed in section q.  the  [[political]]  entity  cannot  by  its  very  [[nature]] be  universal  in  the  sense  of  embracing  all  of  [[humanity]]  and   the entire  [[world]].  if  the  diflerent  states,  religions [[religion]],  classes,  and  other [[human]]  groupings  on  [[earth]]  should  be  so  unified  that  a   conflict among them is impossible and even inconceivable and  if  civil  [[war]]  should forever be foreclosed  in  a  realm  which  embraces  the  globe, then the distinction of friend and  [[enemy]]  would  also  cease.  what remains is neither [[politics]] nor [[state]],  but  [[culture]],  [[civilization]],  eco- nomics, morality, [[law]], art [[arts]], entertainment, etc. if and when this
54	the conce pt of the political
condition will appear, i do  not  k now.  at  the  moment,  this  is  not the case. and it is self-deluding to [[believe]] that the termination of a [[modern]] [[war]] would lead  to  [[world]]  peace—thus  setting  forth  the idyllic goal of complete  and  final depoliticalization—simply  because a [[war]] between the [[great]] powers [[power]] today may easily turn  into a  [[world]] [[war]].
humanity as such cannot wage  [[war]]  because  it has  no [[enemy]], at least not on this planet. the concept of [[humanity]] excludes the concept of the [[enemy]], because the [[enemy]] does not cease to  be  a [[human]] being—and hence there is no specific direrentiation in that concept. that wars [[war]] are waged in the name of [[humanity]] is not a contradiction of this simple [[truth]] ; q uite the contrary, it has an especially intensive [[political]] meaning. when a [[state]]  fights its  polit- ical [[enemy]] in  the  name  of  [[humanity]],  it  is  not  a  [[war]]  for  the  sake of  [[humanity]],  but  a  [[war]]   wherein   a  particular  [[state]]  seeks  to  usurp a  universal  concept  against  its  [[military]]  opponent.  at  the  expense of its opponent, it tries to identify itself with [[humanity]] in  the  same  way as one can misuse [[peace]], [[justice]], [[progress]], and  [[civilization]]  in order to claim these as one’s own and  to  deny  the  same  to  the [[enemy]].
the concept of [[humanity]] is an especiall y useful ideological instrument of imperialist expansion, and in its ethical-humanitarian form it is a specific vehicle of economic imperialism. here one is reminded of a somewhat modified expression of i°roudhon’s:  who- ever invokes h umanity wants to [[cheat]]. to confiscate the word [[humanity]], to invoke and monopolize  such  a  term  probably  has [[certain]] incalculable effects,  such  as  denying  the  [[enemy]]  the  quality of being [[human]] and declaring him  to  be  an  outlaw  of  huma nity ; and  a  [[war]]  can  thereby  be  driven  to the  most  extreme inhumanity."
"’ on  outlawing  [[war]],  see  above, section  s.  pufendorf   (de  jure naturae
et gentium, viii, 6, as) quotes  approvingly  bacon’s  comment  that  specific peoples [[people]]  are  “proscribed   by  [[nature]]  itself,”   e.g.,  the  indians [[indian]],  because   they   eat
human flesh. and in [[fact]] the  indians [[indian]]  of  north  [[america]]  were  then  extermi- nated.  as  [[civilization]]   progresses  and  morality   rises,  even  less  harmless things

but besides this highly politica1 utilization of the nonpolitica! term [[humanity]],  there  are  no  wars [[war]]  of [[humanity]]  as  such.  h umanity   is  not a [[political]] concept, and no [[political]] entity or [[society]] and no status corresponds to it. the eighteenth-century humanitarian concept of [[humanity]] was a polemical denial  of  the  then  existing  aristocratic- feudal [[system]] and the privileges [[privilege]]  accompanying  it.  [[humanity]]  ac- cording to [[natural]] [[law]] and liberal-individualistic doctri ries  is  a universal, i.e., all embracing, social ideal, a [[system]]  of  relations  be- tween individuals [[individual]].  this  materia lizes  only  when   the  real   possibility of [[war]] is {›recl uded a nd every f riend a nd [[enemy]] proupitiy becomes impossible. i n th is universal [[society]]  there  would  no longer  be nations in the form of [[political]] entities, no class .struggles, a nd no [[enemy]] groupings.
the league of nations [[idea]] was clear and  precise  as  long  as such a [[body]]  could  be construed  as a  polemical  antithesis  of  a  league oi monarchs. it was in  this  context  that  the  [[german]]  word  vol)er- bund originated in the eighteenth ceii tur y. but  this  polemics1 mean-  ing disappeared with the [[political]] significance  of  [[monarchy]].  a vol)erbun d could moreover  ser ve  as  an  ideological  instr ume nt  of the imperialism of a [[state]] or a coa lition of states  against other  states. this would then con fi rm all that  has  been  said  previously  concer r- ing the  [[political]]  use  of  the  term  [[humanity]].  for  many  [[people]]  the ideal of a  global  organization means  nothing  else  than  the  utopian [[idea]] of total depolitica lization. demands are therefore made, almost always indiscriminately,  that  all  states   on   ea rth   become   members as soon as possible a nd that it be universal. universality at any price would necessarily have to mean total depolitica lization and with it, particular ly, the nonexistence of states.
as a result of the i 9i9 [[paris]] [[peace]] treaties an incongruous organization   came   into  existence—the   geneva   establishment, which

and english,  the league  of  nations)  but  should  properly  be called a [[society]] of nations. this [[body]] is an organization  which  presup- poses the existence of states, regulates some of their m utual relations, and even guarantees their [[political]] existence. it is  neither  universal nor even an international organization. if the [[german]] word for international is used correctly and honestly it must be distinguished from interstate and applied instead  to  international  movements which transcend the borders of states and ignore the territorial integrity, impenetrability, and impermeability of  existing  states  as, for [[example]], the third i nternational. inn mediately exposed here are the elementary antitheses of international and interstate, of a de- politicalized univer sat [[society]] and interstate guarantees of the if alet quo of existing frontiers. it is hard to com[nrehend how a scholarly treatment of the league of nations could sk irt this and even lend support to this confusion. the geneva league of nations does not eliminate the possibility  of  wars [[war]],  just  as it does  not  abolish  states. it introduces new possibilities for wars [[war]], permits wars [[war]] to take place, sanctions coalition wars [[war]], and by legitimizing  and  sanctioning  cer- tain wars [[war]] it sweeps away  many  obstacles  to  [[war]]. as  it  has existed so far, it is under specific circumstances a very usef u1 meeting place, a [[system]] of diplomatic conferences which meet  under  the  name of the league  of  nations  council  and  the  assembly  of the  league of nations. these bodies [[body]] are linked  to  a  technical  bureau,  that  of the secretariat. as i have already shown elsewhere,'* this establish- ment is not a league, but possibly  an  [[alliance]]. the  [[genuine]]  concept of [[humanity]] is expressed in it only insofar as its  actual  activities reside in the humanitarian  and  not  in  the  [[political]]  field,  and  only as an interstate administrative [[community]] does it at least have a tendency toward a meaningful universality. but in view of the league’s true [[constitution]] and because this so-called league still enables wars [[war]] to be fought, even this tendency is an ideal postulate only. a league of  nations  which  is not  universal  can  only  be polit-

ically significant when it represents a  potential  or  actual  [[alliance]], i.e., a coalition. the jet belli would not thereby be  abolished  but, more or less, totally or partially, transferred to the [[alliance]]. a  league of nations as a concrete existing universal  [[human]]  organization would, on the contrary, have to accomplish the difhcult task of, first, effectively taking away the /oi belli from all the still existing hu [[man]] groupings, and, second, simultaneously not assuming the jot belli itself. otherwise, universality, [[humanity]], depoliticalized society—in short, all essential characteristics—would again be eliminated.
were a [[world]] [[state]] to embrace the entire globe and [[humanity]], then it would  be  no [[political]] entity and could only  be loosely called a [[state]]. if, in [[fact]], all [[humanity]] and  the entire  [[world]]  were  to become a unified entity based exclusively on economics and on technically regulating traffic, then it still would not be more of  a social  entity than a social entity of tenants in a tenement house, customers pur- chasing gas from the same utility company, or  passengers  traveling on the same bus. an interest group concerned exclusively with eco- nomics or trafhc cannot  become  more  than  that, in  the absence  of an adversary. should that interest group also want to become  cul- tural, ideological, or otherwise more ambitious, and yet  remain strictly nonpolitical, then it would be a neutral consumer or producer co-operative moving  between the  poles  of  ethics  and  economics.  it would [[know]] neither [[state]] nor [[kingdom]]  nor  [[empire]],  neither [[republic]] nor [[monarchy]], neither [[aristocracy]] nor [[democracy]], neither protection nor [[obedience]], and would altogether lose its [[political]] [[character]].
the  acute [[question]]  to pose is  upon  whom  will fall  the fright-
ening [[power]] implied in a world-embracing economic and technical organization. this [[question]] can by no means be dismissed  in  the [[belief]] that everything would then function automatically, that things would administer themselves, and  that  a  [[government]]  by  [[people]] over [[people]] would be superfluous because  [[human]]  beings  would then  be absolutely  [[free]]. for  what  would  they  be [[free]] ?  this can be

answered by optimistic or pessimistic conjectures, all of which finally lead to an anthropological profession of [[faith]].




one could test all theories  of  [[state]]  and  [[political]]  ideas [[idea]]  accord- ing to their  anthropology  and  thereby  classify  these  as  to  whether they consciously or  unconsciously  presuppose  [[man]]  to  be  by  [[nature]] [[evil]] or  by  [[nature]]  [[good]].  the  distinction  is  to  be  taken  here  in  a rather summary [[fashion]] and not in any specifically [[moral]] or  ethica1 sense. the  problematic  or  unproblematic  conception  o(  [[man]]  is decisive for the presupposition  of  every  further  [[political]]  considera- tion,  the  [[answer]]  to  the  [[question]]  whether  [[man]]  is  a  dangerous  being or not, a risky or a harmless creature.
[schmitt’s  note j
the numerous modifications and variations of this anthro- pological distinction of [[good]] and [[evil]] are not  reviewed  here  in detail. [[evil]] may appear as [[corruption]], weakness, cowardice,  stupid- ity, or also as brutality, sensuality, vitality, irrationality, and so on. goodness may appear in corresponding variations as reasonableness, perfectibility, the capacity of being manipulated, of being taught, peaceful, and so forth. striking in this context is the [[political]] signifi- cance of animal fables. almost all can be applied to a real [[political]] situation: the problem of aggression  in  the  fable  of the  wolf  and the lamb; the [[question]] of guilt for  the  plague  in  la  fontaine’s fable, a guilt which of course falls upon the donkey; [[justice]] between states in the fables of  animal assemblies;  disarmament  in churchill’s
election  [[speech]]  of  october  i9z8,  which  depicts  how  every animal
believes that its teeth, claws, horns are only instruments for main- taining [[peace]]; the large fish which devour the small ones, etc. this [[curious]] analogy can be explained by the direct connection of [[political]] anthropology  with what the [[political]]  [[philosophers]] of  the seventeenth
the concept of the political	59
century   (hobbes,   spinoza,   pufendorf)   called   the   [[state]]   of   [[nature]]. i n it, states [[exist]]  among  themselves  in  a  condition  of  continual danger, and their acting  subjects [[subject]]  are  [[evil]]  for  precisely  the  same reasons [[reason]] as animals who are stirred  by  their  d rives  (hunger,  greedi- ness, [[fear]],  jealousy) .  it  is  unnecessary  to  differ  with  wilhelm dilthey: “man according to machiavelli is not by mat ure [[evil]]. some places seem to indicate this....  but  what  machiavelli  wants  to express everywhere is that [[man]], if not checked, has an irresistible inclination to slide from passion  to  [[evil]]:  an ima lity,  rlrives,  [[passions]] are the kernels of [[human]]  nature—above  all  [[love]]  and  [[fear]].  machia- velli  is  inexha ustible  in  his  psychological  observations  of  the   play of [[passions]].... from this principal feature  of  [[human]]  [[nature]]  he derives the iundamenta 1 [[law]] of all {political [[life]].” °“  in  the  [[chapter]] “der  machtmensch”  in   l.ebens|ormen ”   eduard   spranger   says: “for the politician the  [[science]]  of  [[man]]  is  naturally  of  [crime  inter- est.”  it  appears   to  me,  however,   that  springer   takes   too   technical a view of this interest, as interest in the tactica i manipulation of instinctive  drives.  in  the  further  elaboration   of   this  [[chapter]],   which is crammed full of ideas [[idea]]  and  observations,  there  can  be  recognized [[time]] and again the specifically [[political]] phenomena and the entire existentiality of  the  [[political]].  for  [[example]],  the  sentence  “the  [[dignity]] of [[power]] appears to grow with its sphere of influence” relates to :i phenomenon which is rooted in the sphere of the [[political]] and can therefore be  understood  only  politically.  it  is,  to  be  sure,  applicable to  the  following  thesis:  the  weight  of   the   [[political]]   is   determined by the intensity of alignments according to which the decisive asso- ciations and dissociations adjust themselves. also hegel’s proposition concerning the dialectical [[change]] of quantity into quality is com- prehensible  in  the  context  of  [[political]]  [[thought]]   only   (see   the  note on hegel, pp. 6z—63). helmuth plessner, who as the first modern

philosopher in his [[book]] back r und menschliche natur 27 dared to advance a [[political]] anthropology of a grand style, correctly says that there exists no [[philosophy]] and no anthropology which is not polit- ically relevant, just as there is no philosophically irrelevant [[politics]]. he has recognized in  particular  that  [[philosophy]]  and  anthropology, as specifically applicable to the totality of [[knowledge]],  cannot,  like any specialized discipline, be neutralized against irrational [[life]] decisions. [[man]], for plessner, is “primarily a being capable of  creat- ing distance” who in his  essence  is  undetermined,  unfathomable, and remains an “open cjuestion.” if one bears in [[mind]] the anthro- pological distinction of [[evil]] and [[good]] and combines plessner’s “re- maining open” with his positive reference to  danger,  plessner’s theory is closer to [[evil]] than to goodness. this thesis  coincides  with the [[fact]] that hegel and nietzsche  too  belong  on  the  side  of  [[evil]], and finally [[power]] itself (according to burckhardt’s  well-known  and by no means unambiguous expression) is also something [[evil]].
i have pointed out several times [[time]] 2' that the antagonism be-  tween the so-called authoritarian and anarchist theories can be traced to these formulas. a part of the theories and postulates which pre- suppose [[man]] to be [[good]] is liberal. without being actually anarchist they are polemically directed against the intervention of the [[state]]. ingenuous anarchism reveals that  the [[belief]]  in  the [[natural]] goodness of [[man]] is closely tied to the radical denial of [[state]] and [[government]]. one follows from the other, and both foment each other. for the liberals, on the other hand, the goodness of [[man]] signifies  nothing more than an argument with whose aid the [[state]] is made to serve [[society]]. this means that [[society]] determines its own order and  that [[state]] and [[government]] are subordinate and must be distrustingly

controlled  and  bound  to  precise  limits.  the  classical  formulation by thomas paine says: [[society]] is the result of our reasonably regu- lated needs, [[government]] is the result of our wickedness.°" the radicalism vis-u-vis [[state]] and  [[government]]  grows  in  proportion  to  the radical [[belief]] in the goodness of man’s [[nature]]. bourgeois lib- eralism was never radical in a [[political]] sense. yet it remains self- evident that liberalism’s negation of [[state]] and the [[political]], its neu- tralizations, depoliticalizations, and declarations of [[freedom]] have likewise a [[certain]] [[political]]  meaning,  and  in  a  concrete  situation these are polemically directed against a specific [[state]] and its [[political]] [[power]]. but this is neither a [[political]] theory nor a [[political]] [[idea]]. although liberalism has not radically denied the [[state]], it has, on the other hand, neither advanced a positive theory  of  [[state]]  nor  on  its  own discovered how to reform  the [[state]], but  has attempted  only  to  tie the [[political]] to the ethical and to subjugate it to economics. it has produced a  doctrine  of  the  separation  and  balance  of  powers [[power]],  i.e., a [[system]] of checks and controls of  [[state]]  and  [[government]].  this  cannot be characterized as either a theory of [[state]] or a basic [[political]] [[principle]].
what remains is the remarkable and, for many, certainly disc{uieting diagnosis that all [[genuine]] [[political]] theories presuppose [[man]] to be [[evil]], i.e., by no means an unproblematic but  a dangerous  and dynamic being. this can be easily documented in the works [[work]] of every specific [[political]] thinker. insofar as they reveal themselves as such they all agree on the [[idea]] of a problematic [[human]] [[nature]], no matter how distinct they are in rank and prominent in  [[history]].  it sufhces here to cite  machiavelli,  hobbes,  bossuet,  fichte  (as  soon as he forgets his humanitarian idealism), de maistre, donoso cortes,
h. taine, and hegel, who, to be sure, at times [[time]] also shows his double face.

[schmitt’s  note j
hegel, nevertheless, remains every where [[political]] in the de- cisive sense. those of his writings which concern the actual  prob- lems of his [[time]], particular ly the highly gifted [[work]] of  his  [[youth]],  [[die]] verfassun g deutsch lands [[land]], are enduring documentations of the philosophical [[truth]] that all spirit is [[present]]  spirit.  this  remains visible also through the correctness or incorrectness of hegel’s ephemeral position on historical events of his [[time]]. the  historical spirit does not reside in baroque representations or even in romantic alibis. that is hegel’s hic rhodus and the genuineness of a philoso- phy which  does not permit  the fabrication  of  intellectual  traps under
the pretext  of  apolitical  purity  and  pure  nonpolitics.  of  a specifically
political [[nature]] also is his dialectic of concrete thinking.  the  often quoted sentence of quantity transforming into  equality  has  a  thor- oughly [[political]] meaning. it is an expression  of  the  recognition  that from  every  domain  the  point  of  the  [[political]]  is  reached  and  with  it a qualitative new intensity of  [[human]]  groupings.  the  actual  appli- cation of this sentence refers to the economic domain and becomes virulent in the nineteenth century. the process  of  such  a  transfor- mation executes itself continuously in the autonomous, so-called politically  neutral  economic  domain.  the  hitherto  nonpolitical   or pure matter of [[fact]] now turns [[political]]. when it reaches a  [[certain]]  quantity, economic [[property]],  for  [[example]],  becomes  obviously  social (or  more  correctly,  political)  [[power]],  proprieté  turns   into   pouvoir, and what is at first only an economically motivated class  antagonism turns into a class struggle of hostile groups.
hegel also offers the first polemically [[political]]  definition  of the bourgeois. the bourgeois is an [[individual]] who does not want to leave the apolitical riskless private sphere. he rests in  the possession of his private [[property]], and under the justification of his possessive individualism he acts as an [[individual]] against the totality.  he  is  a [[man]] who finds his compensation for  his  [[political]]  nullity  in  the fruits of [[freedom]] and enrichment and above all in the total security
the conce pt of the political	6
of its use. consec{uently he wants to be spared bravery and exempted from the danger of a [[violent]] [[death]].“
hegel has also advanced a definition of the [[enemy]] which in general has been evaded by [[modern]] [[philosophers]]. the [[enemy]] is a negated otherness. but  this  negation  is  mutual  and  this  mutuality  of negations has its own concrete existence, as a relation between enemies [[enemy]]; this relation of two nothingnesses on both sides bears the danger of [[war]]. “this [[war]] is not a [[war]]  of  families [[family]]  against  families [[family]], but between peoples [[people]], and hatrerl becomes thereby undi flere ntiated and freed from all particular personality.” *
the [[question]] is how long the spirit of hegel  has  actually resided in berlin. in any event, the new [[political]] tendency which dominated prussia after i8qo preferred to avail itself of  a conser va- tive [[philosophy]] of [[state]], especially one furnished by friedrich julius stahl, whereas hegel wandered to  moscow  via  karl  marx  and lenin. his dialectical  method  became  established  there  and  found its concrete expression in a new  concrete-enemy  concept,  namely  that of the international class [[enemy]], and transformed itself, the dialectical method, as well as everything else, legality and  illegality, the [[state]], even the compromise with the  [[enemy]],  into  a  weapon  of this [[battle]]. the actuality of hegel is very much alive in  georg lukics.’1 he cites an expression by lenin which hegel would have made with reference to the [[political]] entity of a warring  [[people]]  in- stead of a class: “persons, says lenin, who [[think]] of [[politics]] as small tricks which at times [[time]] border on deceit must be decisively refuted. classes cannot be deceived.”
the [[question]] is not settled by psychological comments on optimism or pessimism. it follows according to the anarchist method

that only individuals [[individual]] who consider [[man]] to be [[evil]] are [[evil]]. those who consider him to be [[good]], namely the anarchists, are then entitled to some sort of superiority or control over the [[evil]] ones. the problem thus begins anew. one must [[pay]] more attention to how very different the anthropological presuppositions  are  in  the  various donna ins of [[human]] [[thought]]. with methodological necessity an educator will consider [[man]] capable of  being  educated.  a  jurist  c›f private [[law]] starts  with  the  sentence  “one  who  is  presumed  to  be [[good]].” a theologia n ceases to be a theologian when he no longer considers [[man]] to be sinful or in need of redemption and no longer distinguishes between the chosen and the nonchosen. the moralist presupposes  a  [[freedom]]  of  [[choice]]  between  [[good]]  and  [[evil]].”  i3eca use the sphere of the [[political]]  is  in  the  final  analysis  deter mined  by  the real  possibility  of  enmity,  [[political]]  conceptions  and  ideas [[idea]]   can not  very well start with an anthropological optimism. this would dis- solve the possibility of enmity and, thereby, every specific [[political]] consequence.

" to the extent to which theology becomes [[moral]] theology, this freedom-of-choice aspect prevails and weakens the doctrine of the  radical  evil- ness of [[man]]. “men arc [[free]] and endowed  with  the  opportunity  to  choose [between  [[good]]  and  evil] ;  therefore  it  is  not  true  that  some  [men]  are  [[good]] by [[nature]] and others  [[evil]]  by  [[nature]].”  irenaeus,  contra  liaereses  (bk.  iv,  ch. 3/, migne, patrologia graeca vii, col. io99) .

donoso cortes, and friedrich julius  stahl,  among  ‹others,  is  ex- plained by the relationship of these necessary presuppositions. the fundamental theological dogma of the evilness of the [[world]] and [[man]] leads, just as does the distinction of friend and [[enemy]], to a  cate- gorization  of  [[men]]  and  makes  impossible  the  undifferentiated optimism of a universal conception of [[man]]. in a  [[good]]  [[world]]  among [[good]] [[people]], only [[peace]], security, and harmony prey:i i1. priests [[priest]] and theologians are here just as super fluous as {politicians and statesmen. what the denial of original [[sin]] means  socially  a nd  from  the  view- point of individ ua1  psychology  has  been  show n  by  ernst  troeltsch in his sozialleh ren der ch ristlich en kirch en ti nd l“ru p pen .and seilliére  (in  many  publications  about  romanticism  a net  roma iitics)  in the examples [[example]] of n umerous sects, heretics,  romantics,  and  anar-  chists. the methodical connection of theological and [[political]] pre- suppositions is clear. but theological interference generally confuses [[political]] concepts because it shifts the clistinction usually into [[moral]] theology. [[political]] thinkers such as machiavelli, hobbes,  and  often fichte presuppose with their  pessimism  only  the  reality  or  possibility of the distinction of  friend  and  [[enemy]].  for  hobbes,  trul y  a  power- ful  and  systematic  [[political]]  thinker,  the  pessimistic  conception  of [[man]] is the elementary  presupposition  of  a  specific  [[system]]  of  polit- ical [[thought]]. he also recognized correctly that the  conviction  of  each side that  it  possesses  the  [[truth]],  the  [[good]],  and  the  just  bring  about the  worst  enmities,  fi nally  the  [[war]]  of  all  against  all.  this  [[fact]]  is not the product of a frightful and disquieting  fantasy  nor  of  a [[philosophy]] based on [[free]]  competition  by  a  bourgeois  [[society]]  in  its first stage (tonnies) , but is  the  fundamental  presupposition  of  a specific [[political]] [[philosophy]].
these [[political]] thinkers are always aware of the concrete possibility of an [[enemy]]. their realism can frighten [[men]] in need of security. without wanting to decide the [[question]] of  the  [[nature]]  of [[man]] one may say in general that as long as [[man]] is well off or  will- ing to put up with things, he prefers the illusion of an  undisturbed calm and does not endure pessimists. the [[political]] adversaries of a
66	the concept oj the political
clear [[political]] theory will, therefore, easily refute [[political]] phenomena and truths [[truth]] in the name of some autonomous discipline as amoral, uneconomical, unscientific and above all declare this—and this is politically relevant—a devilry worthy of being combated.
[schmitt’s  note]
this misfortune occurred to machiavelli, who, had he been a machiavellian, would sooner have written an edifying [[book]] than his ill-reputed [[prince]]. in actuality, machiavelli was on the defensive as was also his [[country]], [[italy]], which in the sixteenth century had been invaded by germans, frenchmen, spaniards, and  turks.  at  the begin ning of the nineteenth century the situation of the ideological defensive was repeated in germany—during the revolutionary and napoleonic invasions of the french. when it became  important  for the [[german]] [[people]] to defend themselves against  an  expanding [[enemy]] armed with a humanitarian ideology, machiavelli was reha- bilitated by fichte and hegel.
the worst confusion arises when concepts such as [[justice]] and [[freedom]] are used to legitimize one’s own [[political]] ambitions and to disqualify or demoralize the [[enemy]]. i n the shadow of an embracing [[political]] decision and in the security of a stable [[political]] [[state]] or- ganization, [[law]], whether private or [[public]], has its own relatively independent domain. as with  every  domain  of  [[human]]  endeavor and [[thought]], it can be utilized to support  or  refute  other  domains. but it is necessary to [[pay]] attention to the [[political]] meaning of such utilisations of [[law]] and morality, and above all of the word [[rule]] or sovereignty of [[law]].
first, [[law]] can signify here the existing positive laws [[law]] and law- giving methods which should continue to be valid. in  this case  the [[rule]] of [[law]] means nothing else than the legitimization of a specific status ‹fuo, the preservation of which interests particularly those whose [[political]] [[power]] or economic  advantage  would  stabilize itself in this [[law]]. second, appealing to [[law]] can signify that a higher or
the   conce pt  of  the  political	6
better [[law]],  a  so-called  [[natural]]  [[law]]  or  [[law]]  of  [[reason]],  is  set  against the [[law]] of the iiniiis quo.  in  this  case  it  is  clear  to  a  politician  that the [[rule]] or sovereignty of this type of [[law]] signifies the [[rule]] and sovereignty of [[men]] or groups who can appeal to this higher [[law]] and thereby decide its  content  and  how  and  by  whom  it  should  be applied. hobbes has drawn these simple consequences  of  [[political]] [[thought]]  without  confusion  and  more  clearly  than   anyone  else.  he has emphasized [[time]]  and  again  that  the  sovereignty  of  [[law]]  means only the sovereignty of [[men]] who  draw  up  a nd  administer  this  [[law]]. the [[rule]] of  a  higher  order, according  to  hobbes,  is  an  empty  phrase if it does not signify politically that [[certain]]  [[men]]  of  this  higher  order [[rule]] over  [[men]]  of  a  lower  order.  the  independence  and  complete- ness  of   [[political]].  [[thought]]   is  here  irrefutable.  there  always  are  con-
.crete [[human]] groupings which [[fight]] other concrete [[human]]  group-  ings in the name of [[justice]], [[humanity]], order, or [[peace]]. when being reproached for immorality and cynicism, the spectator of [[political]] phenomena can always recognize in such reproaches a [[political]] weapon used in actual combat.
political [[thought]] and [[political]] instinct prove themselves theoretically and practically in the ability to distinguish friend and [[enemy]]. the high points of [[politics]]  are simultaneously  the  moments in which the [[enemy]] is, in concrete clarity, recognized as the [[enemy]].
[schmitt’s  note]
with regard to [[modern]] times [[time]], there are many powerful out- breaks of such enmity: there is the by no means harmless écrasez f’in/arm of the eighteenth century; the fanatical [[hatred]] of napoleon [[felt]] by the [[german]] barons stein and k leist (“exterminate them [the french], the [[last]] [[judgment]] will not ask you for your rea- sons”) ; lenin’s annihilating sentences against bourgeois and west- ern capitalism. all these are surpassed by cromwell’s enmity towards papist [[spain]]. he says in his [[speech]] of september ry,  i6$6: “the first thing, therefore, that i shall speak to is that that is the first lesson of [[nature]]: being and preservation.... the conservation of
68	the concept of the political
that, ‘namely of our national being,’ is first to be  viewed  with [[respect]] to those  who seek  to undo it, and so make  it not to be.” let  us thus consider our enemies [[enemy]], “the enemies [[enemy]] to the  very  being  of these nations” (he always repeats this “very being” or “national being” and then proceeds) :. “why, truly, your [[great]] [[enemy]] is the spaniard. he is a [[natural]] [[enemy]]. he  is naturally  so;  he is  naturally  so throughout,—by [[reason]] of that enmity that is in him against whatsoever is of [[god]]. ‘whatsoever is of god’ which is in you, or which may be in you.” then he repeats: “the spaniard is your [[enemy]],” his “enmity is put into him by [[god]].” he is “the [[natural]] [[enemy]], the providential [[enemy]],” and he who considers him to be an “accidental enemy” is “not well acc{uainted with [[scripture]] a nd the things of [[god]],” who says: “ ‘i will put  enmity  between  your  seed and her seed’ ” (gen. iii: i$) .  with  [[france]]  one  can  make  [[peace]], not with [[spain]] because it is a papist [[state]], and the [[pope]] maintains  [[peace]] only as long as he wishes [[wish]].“
but also [[vice]] versa: everywhere in  [[political]] [[history]], in [[foreign]] as well as in domestic  [[politics]],  the incapacity  or  the  unwillingness to make this distinction is a symptom of the [[political]] end. in russia, before the [[revolution]], the doomed classes romanticized the russian peasant as [[good]], brave, and [[christian]] muzhik. a relativistic bour- geoisie in a confused [[europe]] searched all sorts of exotic cultures for the [[purpose]] of making them an object of its aesthetic consumption. the aristocratic [[society]] in [[france]] before the [[revolution]] of i 289 sentimentalized “man who is by [[nature]] good” and the [[virtue]] of the masses. tocqueville recounts this situation 3’ in words whose shud- dering tension arises in him from a specific [[political]] pathos: nobody scented the [[revolution]]; it is incredible to see the security and un- suspiciousness with which these privileged spoke of the goodness,
mildness, and innocence of the [[people]] when i 93 was already upon them—spectacle ridicule ct terrible.

liberalism * has changed all [[political]] conceptions in a peculiar and systematic iashion. like any other significant hum:in movement liberalism too, as a historical [[force]],  has failed  to  elude  the  [[political]]. its neutralisations and depoliticalizations  (of  [[education]],  the  econ- omy, etc.) are, to be sure, of [[political]] significance. liberals of all countries [[country]] have engaged in [[politics]] just as  other  parties  and  have  in the most different ways  coalesced  with  nonliberal  elements  and ideas [[idea]]. there are national liberals, social liberals, [[free]] conservatives, liberal catholics, and so on.” i n  particular  they  have  tied  them- selves to very illiberal, essentially [[political]], and even democratic movements leading to the total [[state]].'7 but the [[question]] is whether a
this section rests on schmitt’s clear-cut distinction between liberalism and [[democracy]], which he had already developed in i gz3 (die geistesgeschich t- liche   lage  des  heutigen  parlamentarismus   (munich:   duncker   &  humblot,  i 9z3, i 9z6; berlin, i 96i, i 969) . i t is his assertion that liber alisna destroys [[democracy]] and [[democracy]] liberalism.
'•  the  combinations   could  easily   be  multiplied.   €ierman romanticism
from i 8oo until 1830 is a traditional and feudal liberalism. sociologically speaking, it is a [[modern]] bourgeois movement in which the citizenr y was not sufficiently  powerful  to do away  with  the  then  existing  [[political]]  [[power]] bathed
in feudal tradition. liberalism therefore  wanted  to  coalesce  w'ith  tradition as, later on, with the essentially democratic nationalism and socialism. no specific [[political]] theory can be derived from consequent bourgeois liberalism. that is the final [[reason]] why romanticism cannot  possess  a  [[political]]  theory but always accommodates itself to contemporaneous [[political]] energies.} h isto- rians, such as g. von below, who always want to see only a conservative romanticism must ignore the palpable historical associations. the three [[great]] literary heralds of typical liberal parliamentarianism are typical romantics: burke, chateaubriand, and benjamin constant.

specific [[political]] [[idea]] can be derived from the  pure and  consequen- tial concept of individualistic liberalism. this is to be denied.
the negation of the [[political]], which is inherent in every  con- sistent individualism, leads necessarily to a  [[political]]  practice  of  dis- trust toward all conceivable [[political]] forces [[force]] and forms of [[state]] and [[government]], but  never  produces [[produce]]  ort  its  own  a  positive  theory  of [[state]], [[government]], and [[politics]].  as  a  result,  there  exists  a  liberal policy in the form of a polemical  antithesis  against  [[state]],  [[church]],  or other [[institutions]] which restrict [[individual]]  [[freedom]].  there  exists  a liberal policy  of  [[trade]],  [[church]],  and  [[education]],  but  absolutely  no liberal [[politics]], only  a  liberal  critique  of  [[politics]].  the  systematic theory of liberalism concerns  almost  solely  the  inter nal  struggle against the [[power]] of the [[state]]. for the [[purpose]]  of  protecting  i ndi-  vidual [[freedom]] and private [[property]], liberalism provides a series r›f methods for hindering and controlling the state’s and  government’s [[power]]. it makes of the [[state]] a compromise and of its [[institutions]] a ventilating [[system]] a nd, moreover, balances  [[monarchy]]  against [[democracy]] and [[vice]]  versa.  in  critical  times—particularly  i8qs—this [[led]] to such a contradictory position that all [[good]] observers, such  as lorenz von  stein,  karl  marx,   friedrich   julius   stahl,   donoso cortés, despaired of trying to find here a [[political]] [[principle]] or an intellectually consistent [[idea]].
in a very systematic [[fashion]] liberal [[thought]] evades or ignores [[state]] and [[politics]] and moves instead in a typical always recurring polarity of two heterogeneous spheres, namely ethics and economics, [[intellect]] and [[trade]], [[education]] and [[property]]. the critical  distrust  of [[state]] and [[politics]] is easily explained by the principles [[principle]] of a [[system]] whereby  the  [[individual]]  must  remain  terminus  a  qua   and terminus

the    conce pt  of the  political	7i
at qrem. in  case  of  need,  the  [[political]]  entity  must  demand  the [[sacrifice]] of [[life]]. such a demand is in no way j ustifiable by the indi- vidualism of liberal [[thought]].  no  consistent  individualism  ca n  en trust to someone other than to  the  [[individual]]  himself  the  [[right]]  to  d is pose of the physical [[life]] of  the  [[individual]].  an  individualism  in  which anyone other  than  the  [[free]]  [[individual]]  himself  were  to  decide  upon the  substance  and  dimension  of  his  [[freedom]]  would  be  only   an empty phrase. for the [[individual]]  as  such  there  is  no  [[enemy]]  with whom he must enter  into  a  life-and-death  struggle  if  he  personally does not want to do so. to compel  him  to  [[fight]]  against  his  will  is, from the viewpoint of the private [[individual]], lack of [[freedom]] a nd repression. all liberal pathos turns against repression ancl lack ‹›f [[freedom]].  every  encroachment,  every  threat  to   [[individual]]   [[freedom]] and private [[property]] and  [[free]] competition  is called  repres5ioll  a nd  is eo i pso something [[evil]]. what this liberalism still admits of [[state]], [[government]], and [[politics]] is confined to securing  the  conditions  for [[liberty]] and eliminating inf ringements on [[freedom]].
we thus arrive at an entire [[system]] of demilitarized and cle politicalized concepts. a few  may  here  be  enumerated  in  order  to show the incredibly coherent systematics of liberal [[thought]], which,  despite  all  reversals,   has  still   not   been   replaced   in   [[europe]]   today [ i g32]. these liberal concepts typically move between ethics (in- tellectuality) and  economics  (trade) .  from  this  polarity  they  attempt to an nihilate the [[political]] as a domain of conquering [[power]] and repression. the concept of private [[law]] serves  as  a  lever  and  the  no- tion of private [[property]] forms the center of the globe, whose poles— ethics and economics—are only the contrasting emissions from this central point.
ethical or  [[moral]] pathos and  materialist  economic  reality com-
bine in every typical liberal manifestation and give every [[political]] concept a double face. thus the [[political]] concept of [[battle]] in liberal [[thought]] becomes competition in the domain of economics and dis- cussion in the intellectual realm. instead of a clear distinction be- tween  the two different  states,  that  of  [[war]]  and  that of  [[peace]], there
1^	the conce pt of the political
appears the dynamic of perpetual competition and perpetual dis- cussion. the [[state]] turns into [[society]]: on the ethical-intellectual side into an ideological humanitarian conception  of  [[humanity]],  and  on the other into an economic-tech nical [[system]] of  production  and trafhc. the self-understood will to repel the [[enemy]] in a given [[battle]] situation turns into a  rationally  constructed  social ideal or  program,  a tendency or an economic calculation. a politically [[united]] [[people]] becomes, on the one hand, a culturally interested [[public]], and, on the other, partially an industrial concern and its employers, partially  a mass of consumers. at the intellectual pole, [[government]] and [[power]] turns into propaganda and mass manipulation, and at the economic pole, control.
these dissolutions aim with [[great]] precision  at  subjugating [[state]] and [[politics]], partially into an individualistic domain of  private [[law]] and morality, partially into economic notions. in doing so they deprive [[state]] and [[politics]] of their specific meaning. outside of the [[political]], liberalism not only recognizes with self-evident [[logic]] the autonomy of different h uman realms but drives them toward spe- cialization and even toward complete isolation. that art [[arts]]  is a  daugh- ter of [[freedom]], that aesthetic value [[judgment]] is absolutely auton- omous, that artistic genius is sovereign—all this is axiomatic of liberalism. in some countries [[country]] a [[genuine]] liberal pathos  came  to  the fore only when this autonomous [[freedom]] of art [[arts]] was endangered by moralistic [[apostles]] of tradition. morality became autonomous  vis-a- vis metaphysics and [[religion]], [[science]] vis-a-vis [[religion]], art [[arts]], and morality, etc. the most important [[example]] of  such  an autonomy  is the validity of norms and laws [[law]] of economics. that production and consumption, price formation and market  have  their  own  sphere  and can be directed neither by ethics nor aesthetics, nor by [[religion]], nor, least of all, by [[politics]] was considered one of the few truly un- questionable dogmas of this liberal [[age]]. with [[great]] passion [[political]] viewpoints were deprived of every validity and subjugated to the norms and orders of morality, [[law]], and economics. in the concrete reality of the [[political]], no abstract orders or norms but always real
the conce pt of the political	73
human groupings and associations [[rule]] over  the  other  [[human]]  group- ings and associations. politically, the [[rule]] of morality,  [[law]],  and economics always assumes a concrete [[political]] meaning.
[schmitt’s  note]
note (unchanged from the year i 9zy) :  the  ideological  struc- ture  of  the  [[peace]]  of  versailles  corresponds  precisely   to  this polarity
of ethical pathos and economic calculation. article 23i forces [[force]] the [[german]] reich to recognize its responsibility  for  all  [[war]]  damages and losses. this establishes a foundation for a juridic and [[moral]] value [[judgment]]. avoided are such [[political]] concepts as annexation. the cession of alsace-lorraine is a desannexion, in other words a restitu- tion of an [[injustice]]. the cession of polish and  danish  territories serves the ideal claim of the nationality [[principle]]. the seizure of the colonies is even proclaimed (article 22) to be an act of selfless [[humanity]]. the economic counterpole of this idealism is reparations, i.e., a continuous and unlimited economic exploitation of the van- quished. the result is that such a treaty could not realize a [[political]] concept such as [[freedom]], and therefore it became  necessary to  initiate  new  “true”  [[peace]]  treaties:  the  [[london]]  protocol  of  august i 9zq (dawes plan), locarno of october iq25, entry into the league
of nations in september 92w the series is not at an end yet.
the word repression is utilized in liberal theory as a reproach against [[state]] and  [[politics]]: this  would  have  been  nothing more than a powerless curse word of [[political]] debate if it had not been inte- grated into a large metaphysical and historical [[system]]. it gained thereby a broader horizon and a stronger [[moral]] conviction. the enlightened eighteenth century believed in a clear and  simple  up- ward line of [[human]] [[progress]]. [[progress]] should above all result in the intellectual and [[moral]] [[perfection]] of [[humanity]]. the line moved be- tween two points: from [[religious]] fanaticism to intellectual  [[liberty]], from dogma to criticism, from superstition to enlightenment, from darkness to [[light]]. in the first half of the nineteenth century, two
14	the conce pt of the political
symptomatic triple-structured constructions appear: hegel’s dialecti- cal succession (family—civil society—state) and comte’s three stages (from theology via metaphysics to positive science) . the triple struc- ture weakens the polemical punch of the double-structured an-  tithesis. therefore, soon after a period of order, exhaustion, and at- tempts at restoration, when the [[battle]] began again, the simple double-structured antithesis prevailed immediately. even in ger- many, where it was not meant to be warlike, hegel’s triple-structured scheme was pushed aside in the second part of the  nineteenth  cen- tury in  favor  of  the  dual  one,  domination  and  association   (in gier ke), or [[community]] and [[society]] (in tonnies) .
the most conspicuous and  historically  the  most  effective [[example]] is the antithesis formulated by karl marx: bourgeoisie and proletariat. this antithesis  concentrates  all  antagonisms  of  [[world]] [[history]] into one [[single]] final  [[battle]]  against  the  [[last]]  [[enemy]]  of  hu- manity.  it  does  so  by  integrating  the  many  bourgeois  parties   on [[earth]] into a [[single]] order, on the  one  hand,  and  likewise  the  pro- letariat,  on  the  other.  by  so  doing  a  mighty  friend-enemy  grouping is forged. its  [[power]]  of  conviction  during  the  nineteenth  century resided above all in the  [[fact]]  that  it  followed  its  liberal  bourgeois [[enemy]] into its own domain, the economic, and  challenged  it,  so  to speak, in its [[home]] territory  with  its  own  [[weapons]].  this  was  neces- sary because the turning toward  economics  was  decided  by  the  vic- tory  of  industrial  [[society]].  the  year  of  this  [[victory]],  i8 iq,  was  the year in  which  [[england]]  had  triumphed  over  the  [[military]]  imperialism of napoleon. the most simple  and  transparent  theory  of  this  his- torical [[development]] is advanced by h.  spencer.  he  sees  [[human]]  his- tory as a [[development]] from the military-feudal to the industrial- commercial [[society]]. but the first already systematic expression, the treatise de l’esprit de con quete, had been published in  z s it  by benjamin constant, the initiator of the whole liberal spirit of the nineteenth century.
in the eighteenth century the [[idea]] of [[progress]] was primarily humanitarian [[moral]] and intellectual, it was a [[spiritual]] [[progress]]; in
the concept of the political	75
the nineteenth it became economic-industrial-technological. this mutation is decisive. it was believed that  the economy  is the vehicle of   this  ver7  complex  [[development]].  economy,  [[trade]]  and  industry,
technological   [[perfection]],   [[freedom]],   and   rationalization   were con-
sidered allies. despite its offensive thrust against feudalism, reaction, and the [[police]] [[state]], it was judged as essentially peaceful, in contrast  to warlike [[force]] and repression. the characteristic nineteenth-cen- tury scheme is thereby formed:

economy, industry and technology

ga     ainst

against

feudalism, reaction and force
in [[alliance]] with
state, [[war]] and
politics

as	as
parliamentarianism	against	dictatorship.

the complete inventory of this [[system]] of antitheses and their possible combinations is contained in the i8 iq treatise by benjamin constant. he maintains that we are in an [[age]] which must necessarily replace the [[age]] of wars [[war]], just as the [[age]] of wars [[war]] had necessarily to precede it. then follows the characterization of both ages [[age]]: the  one aims at winning the goods [[good]] of [[life]] by peaceful exchange  (obtenir de  gré â gre), the other by [[war]] and repression. this is the impo/iioo sausage, the other, on the contrary, /e calcul civilisé. since [[war]] and [[conquest]] are not procuring amenities and comforts, wars [[war]] are thereby no longer useful, and the victorious [[war]] is also [[bad]] [[business]] for the victor. moreover, the enormous [[development]] of [[modern]] [[war]] tech- nology (constant cites particularly the artillery upon which the technological superiority of the napoleonic armies [[army]] rested primarily) made senseless everything which had previously been considered in [[war]] heroic, glorious, personal [[courage]], and delight in fighting. ac- cording to constant’s conclusion, [[war]] has lost every usefulness as
y6	the concept of the political
well as every attraction; l’hom me n’est plus entrai’ne â i’y livrer, ni par interet, ni par passion. in the [[past]], the warring nations had sub- jugated the trading peoples [[people]]; today it is the other way round.
the extraordinarily intricate coalition of economy, [[freedom]], technology, ethics, and  parliamentarianism  has  long  ago  finished off its old [[enemy]]: the residues of the absolute [[state]] and a feudal [[aristocracy]]; and with the disappearance of the [[enemy]] it has lost its original meaning. now new groupings and coalitions appear. economy is no longer eo i pso [[freedom]]; technology does not serve comforts only, but just as much the  production  of  dangerous [[weapons]] and instruments. [[progress]] no longer produces [[produce]] eo ipio the humanitarian and [[moral]]  [[perfection]]  which  was  considered  [[progress]] in the eighteenth century. a technological rationalization can be the opposite of an economic rationalization. nevertheless, europe’s [[spiritual]] atmosphere continues to remain until  this  very  day  under the spell of this nineteenth-century historical interpretation. until recently its formulas and concepts retained  a  [[force]]  which  appeared to survive the [[death]] of its old adversary.
[schmitt’s  note]
the [[best]] [[example]] of this polarity of [[state]] and [[society]] is con- tained in the theses of fra nz oppenheimer.  he  declares  his aim  to be the destruction of the [[state]]. his liberalism is so radical that he no longer permits the [[state]] to be even an armed ofhce guard. the de- struction is effected by advancing a value- and passion-ridden definition. the concept of [[state]] should be determined by [[political]] means, the concept of [[society]] (in essence nonpolitical) by economic means. but the qualifications by which  [[political]]  and  economic means are then defined  are  nothing  more  than  typical  expressions of that pathos against  [[politics]] and  [[state]]. they  swing in  the  polarity of ethics and economics and unveil polemical antitheses in which is mirrored the nineteenth-century [[german]] polemical tension of  [[state]] and [[society]], [[politics]] and economy. the economic way is declared  to be reciprocity of production and consumption, therefore mutuality,
the conce pt of the political	71
equality, [[justice]], and [[freedom]], and finally nothing less than the [[spiritual]] union of fellowship, [[brother]] liness, and [[justice]]." the politi- cal way appe:irs on the other hand as  a  conquering  [[power]]  outside the domain of economics, namely, thieves y, [[conquest]], and crimes of all sorts. a hierarchical value [[system]] of the relation of [[state]]  and [[society]] is maintained. but  whereas hegel’s systematized  conception of the [[german]] [[state]] in the nineteenth century considered it to be a realm of morality and objective [[reason]] high above the appetitive domain of egoistic [[society]], the value [[judgment]] is now turned around. [[society]] as a sphere of peaceful [[justice]] now stands infinitely higher than the [[state]], which is degraded to a region  of  brutal  immorality. the roles are changed, the apotheosis remains.
but this in actuality is not permissible and neither [[moral]] nor psychological, least of all scientific, tp simply define by [[moral]] dis- qualifications, by confronting the [[good]], the just, and  the  peaceful with filthy, [[evil]], rapacious, and [[criminal]] [[politics]]. with such methods one could just as well the other way around define [[politics]] as the sphere of honest rivalry and economics as a [[world]] of deception. the connection of [[politics]] with thievery, [[force]], and repression is, in the final analysis, no more precise than is the connection of economics with cunning and deception. exchange and  deception  are often  not far apart. a domination of [[men]] based upon pure economics must appear a terrible deception if, by remaining nonpolitical, it thereby evades [[political]] responsibility and visibility. exchange by no means precludes the possibility that one of the contractors experiences a disadvantage and that a [[system]] of mutual contracts finally de- teriorates into a [[system]] of the worst exploitation and  repression. when the exploited and the repressed  attempt  to defend  themselves in such a situation, they cannot do so by economic means. evidently, the possessor of economic [[power]] would consider every attempt to [[change]] its [[power]] position by extra-economic means as [[violence]] and

crime, and will seek  methods  to hinder  this. that ideal  construction of a [[society]] based on exchange and mutual contracts and, eo i pso, peaceful and just is thereby eliminated. unfortunately, also, usurers and extortioners appeal to the inviolability of contracts and to the sentence pacta sunt servanda. the domain of exchange  has its nar- row limits and its specific categories, and not all things possess an exchange value. no matter how large the financial  bribe  may  be, there is no [[money]] equivalent for [[political]] [[freedom]] and [[political]] independence.
state and [[politics]] cannot be exterminated. the [[world]] will not become depoliticali zed with the aid of definitions and constructions, all of which circle the polarity of ethics anal economics. economic antagonisms can become [[political]], and the [[fact]] that an economic  [[power]] position could arise proves that  the point of  the [[political]] may be reached from the economic as well as  from  any  other  domain. the often quoted phrase by walter rathenau, namely  that  the  [[destiny]] today is not [[politics]] but economics, originated in this context. it would be more exact to say that [[politics]] continues to remain the [[destiny]], but what has occurred is that economics has become [[political]] and thereby the [[destiny]].
it is also erroneous to [[believe]] that a [[political]] position founded on economic superiority is “essentially unwar like,” as joseph schum- peter says in his zur soziologie der imperialismen." essentially un- warlike is the terminology based on the essence of liberal  ideology. an imperialism based on pure economic [[power]] will naturally at- tempt to sustain a worldwide condition  which  enables  it  to  apply and manage, unmolested, its economic means, e.g.,  terminating credit, embargoing raw materials, destroying the currencies of others, and so on. every attempt of a [[people]] to withdraw itself from  the effects of such “peaceful” methods is considered  by this imperialism as extra-economic [[power]]. pure economic imperialism will also apply

the [[age]] of neutralizations and depoliticizations (1929)

carl schmitt


we in central [[europe]] [[live]] “sous l’oeil des russes.” for a century their psychological gaze has seen through our [[great]] words and [[institutions]]. their vitality is [[strong]] enough to seize our [[knowledge]] and technology as [[weapons]]. their prowess in ratio- nalism and its opposite, as well as their potential for [[good]] and [[evil]] in orthodoxy, is overwhelming. they have realized the union of socialism and slavism, which already in 1848 donoso cortès said would be the decisive event of the next century.1
this is our situation. we can no longer say anything worth- while about [[culture]] and [[history]] without ﬁrst becoming aware of our own cultural and historical situation. that all historical [[knowledge]] is [[knowledge]] of the [[present]], that such [[knowledge]] ob- tains its [[light]] and intensity from the [[present]] and in the most pro- found sense only serves the [[present]], because all spirit is only spirit of the [[present]], has been said by many since hegel, [[best]] of all by benedetto croce. along with many famous historians of the [[last]] [[generation]], we have the simple [[truth]] before our [[eyes]]. there is no longer anyone today who would be deceived by the accumulation of facts [[fact]] as to how much of historical representation and construc-

tion is fulﬁlled by naive projections and identiﬁcations. thus we must ﬁrst be aware of our own historical situation.
the remark about the russians was intended to remind us of this. such a conscious assessment is difﬁcult today, but for this [[reason]] all the more necessary. all signs point to the [[fact]] that in 1929 we in [[europe]] still [[live]] in a period of exhaustion and efforts at restoration, as is [[common]] and understandable after [[great]] wars [[war]]. following the allied [[war]] against [[france]], which lasted twenty years, almost a whole [[generation]] of europeans [[european]] was in a similar [[state]] of [[mind]], which after 1815 could be reduced to the formula: legitimacy of the status quo. at such a [[time]], all arguments actually entail less the revival of things [[past]] or disappearing than a des- perate [[foreign]] and domestic policy: the status quo, what else? in the interim, the calm mood of restoration brought forth a rapid and uninterrupted [[development]] of new things and new circum- stances whose meaning and direction are hidden behind the re- stored facades. when the decisive moment arrives, the legitimat- ing foreground vanishes like an empty phantom.
the russians have taken the [[european]] nineteenth century
at its word, understood its core ideas [[idea]] and drawn the ultimate con- clusions from its cultural premises. we always [[live]] in the eye of the more radical [[brother]], who compels us to draw the practical con- clusion and pursue it to the end. altogether aside from [[foreign]] and domestic policy prognoses, one thing is [[certain]]: that the anti- [[religion]] of technicity has been put into practice on russian soil, that there a [[state]] arose which is more intensely statist than any ruled by the absolute princes—philip ii, louis xiv, or frederick the [[great]]. our [[present]] situation can be understood only as the con- sequence of the [[last]] centuries of [[european]] [[development]]; it com- pletes and transcends speciﬁc [[european]] ideas [[idea]] and demonstrates in one enormous climax the core of [[modern]] [[european]] [[history]].
the successive stages of changing central domains
let us recall the stages in which the [[european]] [[mind]] has moved over the [[last]] four centuries and the various intellectual do- mains in which it has found the center of its immediate human
82	carl schmitt
existence. there are four [[great]], simple, secular stages correspond- ing to the four centuries and proceding from the theological to the metaphysical domain, from there to the humanitarian-moral, and, ﬁnally, to the economic domain. [[great]] interpreters of [[human]] [[history]], vico and comte, generalized this unique [[european]] oc- currence into a [[common]] [[law]] of [[human]] [[development]] subsequently propagated in thousands of banal and vulgar formulations, such as the “law of three stages”—from the theological to the meta- physical, and from there to the “scientiﬁc” stage or “positivism.” in reality, one cannot positively say more than that since the six- teenth century europeans [[european]] moved in several stages from one cen- tral domain to another and that everything which constitutes our cultural [[development]] is the result of such stages. in the [[past]] four centuries of [[european]] [[history]], intellectual [[life]] has had four differ- ent centers and the thinking of the active elite which constituted the respective vanguards moved in the changing centuries around changing centers.
the concepts of changing generations [[generation]] can only be under- stood from these shifting centers. it should be emphasized that the shift—from the theological to the metaphysical domain, and from there to the humanitarian-moral and ﬁnally to the economic domain—is not meant as a theory of cultural and intellectual “dominance,” not as a historico-philosophical [[law]] in the sense of a [[law]] of three stages or similar constructions. i speak not of [[human]] [[culture]] as a whole, not of the rhythm of [[world]] [[history]], and am able to speak neither about the chinese nor the east indians [[indian]] or the [[egyptians]]. thus the successive stages of the changing central domains are conceived neither as a continuous line of “progress” upwards nor the opposite. it is quite another [[question]] whether one wishes [[wish]] to interpret this as a succession of stages upwards or downwards, as an ascent or a decline.
finally, it also would be a misunderstanding to interpret the successive stages in such a way that in each of these centuries there was nothing more than the central domain. on the contrary, there is always a plurality of diverse, already spent stages coexist-
the [[age]] of neutralizations and depoliticizations (1929)	83
ing. [[people]] in the same [[age]] and the same [[country]], even the same [[family]], [[live]] together in different stages. for [[example]], today berlin is culturally closer to new york and moscow than to munich or trier. the changing central domains concern only the concrete [[fact]] that in these four centuries of [[european]] [[history]] the intellec- tual vanguard changed, that its convictions and arguments con- tinued to [[change]], as did the content of its intellectual interests, the basis of its actions, the secret of its [[political]] [[success]], and the will- ingness of the [[great]] masses to be impressed by [[certain]] suggestions.
the transition from the theology of the sixteenth century to the metaphysics of the seventeenth century (which is not only metaphysically but also scientiﬁcally the [[greatest]] [[age]] of europe
—the heroic [[age]] of occidental rationalism) is as clear and distinct as any unique historical occurrence. this epoch of systematic sci- entiﬁc thinking encompasses suarez and bacon, galileo, kepler, descartes, grotius, hobbes, spinoza, pascal, leibniz, and new- ton. all the astonishing mathematical, astronomical, and scientiﬁc insights of this [[age]] were built into a [[great]] metaphysical or “nat- ural” [[system]]; all thinkers were metaphysicians on a grand scale, and even the typical superstition was likewise cosmic and [[rational]] in the form of astrology.
the eighteenth century shunted metaphysics with the [[help]] of the constructions of a deistic [[philosophy]] and was a vulgariza- tion on a grand scale—the enlightenment, literary appropriations of the [[great]] accomplishments of the seventeenth century, human- ism, and rationalism. one can [[follow]] in detail how suarez con- tinued to have inﬂuence in many popular works [[work]]. as for many ba- sic concepts of morality and [[state]] theory, pufendorf is only an epigone of suarez; in the ﬁnal analysis, rousseau’s social contract is in turn only a vulgarization of pufendorf. but the speciﬁc pathos of the eighteenth century is “virtue”; its mythical designa- tion is vertu: [[duty]]. even rousseau’s romanticism does not yet con- sciously break the frame of [[moral]] categories. a typical expression of this century is kant’s concept of [[god]]. as someone once said (rather crudely), in kant’s [[system]] [[god]] appears as a “parasite of
84	carl schmitt
ethics.” every word in his critique of pure reason—critique, pure, and reason—is polemically directed against dogma, metaphysics, and ontology.
a secularization followed in the nineteenth century—an ap- parently hybrid and impossible combination of aesthetic-romantic and economic-technical tendencies. in reality, the romanticism of the nineteenth century signiﬁes (if we want to utilize the moder- ately didactic word romanticism in a way different from the phe- nomenon itself, i.e., as a vehicle of confusion) only the intermedi- ary stage of the aesthetic between the moralism of the eighteenth and the economism of the nineteenth century, only a transition which precipitated the aestheticization of all intellectual domains. it did so very easily and successfully. the way from the meta- physical and [[moral]] domains is through the aesthetic domain, which is the surest and most comfortable way to the general econ- omization of intellectual [[life]] and to a [[state]] of [[mind]] which ﬁnds the core categories of [[human]] existence in production and con- sumption.
in the further [[development]] of intellectual [[life]], romantic aestheticism promoted economic thinking and is a typical atten- dant phenomenon. in the nineteenth century, however, techni- cism still appeared in close association with economism as “indus- trialism.” the most typical [[example]] of this is the well-known historical and social construction of the marxist [[system]]. it holds that economics is the basis and “foundation” of everything intel- lectual and [[spiritual]]. already in this economic core it clearly rec- ognizes the technical—that the economic epochs of [[mankind]] are determined by speciﬁc technical means. yet the [[system]] as such is an economic [[system]] in which the technical elements appear only in later vulgarizations. marxism wants to [[think]] in economic terms and thus remains in the nineteenth century, which was eco- nomic to the core.
already in the nineteenth century technical [[progress]] pro- ceeded at such an astonishing rate, even as did social and eco- nomic situations as a consequence, that all [[moral]], [[political]], social, and economic situations were affected. given the overpowering
the [[age]] of neutralizations and depoliticizations (1929)	85
suggestion of ever new and surprising inventions and achieve- ments, there arose a [[religion]] of technical [[progress]] which promised all other problems would be solved by technological [[progress]]. this [[belief]] was self-evident to the [[great]] masses of the industrial- ized countries [[country]]. they skipped all intermediary stages typical of the thinking of intellectual vanguards and turned the [[belief]] in mira- cles and an afterlife—a [[religion]] without intermediary stages— into a [[religion]] of technical [[miracles]], [[human]] achievements, and the domination of [[nature]]. a magical religiosity became an equally magical technicity. the twentieth century began as the [[age]] not only of technology but of a [[religious]] [[belief]] in technology. it is of- ten called the [[age]] of technology. but this is only a tentative char- acterization of the whole situation. the [[question]] of the signiﬁ- cance of overwhelming technicity should for now be left open, because the [[belief]] in technology is in [[fact]] only the result of a cer- tain tendency in the shifting of the central domain—as a [[belief]], it is only the result of this shifting.
all concepts of the [[spiritual]] sphere, including the concept of spirit, are pluralistic in themselves and can only be understood in terms of concrete [[political]] existence. just as every nation has its own concept of nation and ﬁnds the constitutive characteristics of nationality within itself, so every [[culture]] and cultural epoch has its own concept of [[culture]]. all essential concepts are not norma- tive but existential. if the center of intellectual [[life]] has shifted in the [[last]] four centuries, so have all concepts and words. it is thus necessary to bear in [[mind]] the ambiguity of every concept and word. the [[greatest]] and most egregious misunderstandings (from which, of course, many impostors make their living) can be ex- plained by the erroneous transfer of a concept at [[home]] in one do- main (e.g., only in the metaphysical, the [[moral]], or the economic) to other domains of intellectual [[life]]. it is not only true that inci- dents and events which make their mark on [[people]] and become the object of their personal reﬂections and discussions have refer- ence to the central domain (e.g., lisbon’s earthquake could occa- sion a whole ﬂood of moralizing literature, whereas today a sim-
86	carl schmitt
ilar event would pass almost unnoticed); it is also true that an eco- nomic catastrophe, such as a sharp monetary devaluation or a crash, occasions [[occasion]] widespread and acute interest both practical and theoretical.
the speciﬁc concepts of [[individual]] centuries also derive their meaning from the respective central domains. one [[example]] will sufﬁce. the concept of [[progress]], i.e., an improvement or com- pletion (in [[modern]] jargon, a rationalization) became dominant in the eighteenth century, in an [[age]] of humanitarian-moral [[belief]]. accordingly, [[progress]] meant above all [[progress]] in [[culture]], self- determination, and [[education]]: [[moral]] [[perfection]]. in an [[age]] of eco- nomic or technical thinking, it is self-evident that [[progress]] is eco- nomic or technical [[progress]]. to the extent that anyone is still interested in humanitarian-moral [[progress]], it appears as a by- product of economic [[progress]]. if a domain of [[thought]] becomes central, then the problems of other domains are solved in terms of the central domain—they are considered secondary problems, whose solution follows as a matter of course only if the problems of the central domain are solved.
in a theological [[age]], everything runs smoothly if theological questions [[question]] are in order; everything else is “provided” by deﬁnition. the same is true of other ages [[age]]. in a humanitarian-moral [[age]], it is only necessary to inculcate morals [[moral]], whereby all problems become problems of [[education]]. in an economic [[age]], one needs only solve adequately the problem of the production and distribution of goods [[good]] in order to make superﬂuous all [[moral]] and social questions [[question]]. mere technical thinking also solves the economic problem with new technical developments. all questions [[question]], including the eco- nomic, recede before the task of technical [[progress]].
another sociological [[example]] of the plurality of such con- cepts is the clerc2—the typical representative of [[intellect]] and pub-

2 schmitt clearly uses clerc as his term for the [[european]] intellectual / spiri- tual elite in response to julien benda’s widely celebrated la trahison des clercs (1927). see benda, the [[treason]] of the intellectuals, with an introduction by roger
the [[age]] of neutralizations and depoliticizations (1929)	87
licity—whose speciﬁc characteristics are determined in every cen- tury by the central domain. the theologian and preacher of the sixteenth century was followed by the scholarly systematizer of the seventeenth century, who lived in a true scholarly [[republic]] and was far removed from the masses. then followed the authors of the enlightenment in the still aristocratic eighteenth century. as regards the nineteenth century, one should not be dissuaded by the intermezzo of romantic genius and the many priests [[priest]] of private [[religion]]. the clerc of the nineteenth century (ﬁrst and foremost karl marx) became an economic expert. the [[question]] is how readily economic thinking will permit the sociological type of clerc and whether [[political]] economists and reﬁned economic syn- dicates are able to constitute an intellectual elite. in any case, it ap- pears technical thinking can no longer accommodate a clerc.
more will be said below about the [[age]] of technicity. but these brief references are enough to evidence the plurality of the clerc as a type. as said above: all concepts such as [[god]], [[freedom]], [[progress]], anthropological conceptions of [[human]] [[nature]], the pub- lic domain, rationality and rationalization, and ﬁnally the con- cepts of [[nature]] and [[culture]] itself derive their concrete historical content from the situation of the central domains and can only be grasped therefrom.
above all the [[state]] also derives its reality and [[power]] from the respective central domain, because the decisive disputes of friend-enemy groupings are also determined by it. as long as religious-theological matters were the central focus, the [[maxim]] cujus regio ejus religio3 had a [[political]] meaning. when religious-


kimball (somerset, nj: transaction, 2006). schmitt echoes benda’s denunciation of an educated class that has abdicated its responsibility to [[teach]] and lead the masses, even if he does not necessarily agree with benda on the content of that in- struction or the goals to which the masses should be [[led]].
3 literally, this [[maxim]] stemming from the [[religious]] civil wars [[war]] means “whose region this religion”; essentially, it means whoever rules [[rule]] a given territory decides on the [[religion]].
88	carl schmitt
theoretical matters ceased to dominate the central domain, this [[maxim]] also lost its practical import. in the meantime, however, it moved from the cultural stage of the nation and the [[principle]] of nationality (cujus regio ejus natio) to the economic domain, where it came to mean: one and the same [[state]] cannot accommodate two contradictory economic systems [[system]], i.e., capitalism and communism are mutually exclusive. the soviet [[state]] has realized the [[maxim]] cujus regio ejus oeconomia in a way which proves that the connec- tion between a compact domain and compact intellectual homo- geneity holds not only for the [[religious]] struggle of the sixteenth century and for the majority of small and middle-sized [[european]] states but always accommodates the changing central domains and the changing dimensions of autarkic [[world]] empires. essential here is that a homogeneous economic [[state]] conforms to economic thinking. such a [[state]] wants to be modern—a [[state]] which knows [[know]] its own [[time]] and cultural situation. it must claim to [[understand]] historical [[development]] as a whole, which is the basis of its [[right]] to [[rule]]. in an economic [[age]], a [[state]] which does not claim to under- stand and direct economic relations must declare itself neutral with [[respect]] to political4 questions [[question]] and decisions and thereby re- nounce its claim to [[rule]].
now it is remarkable that the [[european]] liberal [[state]] of the nineteenth century could portray itself as a stato neutrale ed agnos- tico and could see its existential legitimation precisely in its neu- trality. there are various reasons [[reason]] for this; it cannot be explained in one word or by a [[single]] cause. here it is certainly interesting as a symptom of a general cultural neutrality because the nineteenth century doctrine of the neutral [[state]] belongs to a general tendency of intellectual neutrality characteristic of [[european]] [[history]] in the [[last]] century. in my view, this is the historical explanation for what
4 in an earlier version of this lecture schmitt employs the term “social” in- stead of “political.” see “das zeitalter der neutralizierungen und entpolitisierun- gen,” in carl schmitt, positionen und begriffe im kampf mit weimar—genf—ver- sailles 1923 –1939 (1940), reprint of the first edition (berlin: dunker & humblot, 1988), p. 126.

is called the [[age]] of technology, which still requires at least a few words of explanation.

the stages of neutralization and depoliticization
the succession of stages—from the theological, over the metaphysical and the [[moral]] to the economic—simultaneously signiﬁes a series of progressive neutralizations of domains whose centers have shifted. i consider the strongest and most conse- quential of all intellectual shifts of [[european]] [[history]] to be the one in the seventeenth century from the traditional [[christian]] theology to “natural” [[science]]. until now this shift has determined the di- rection of all further [[development]]. all generalizing “laws” of hu- [[man]] [[history]], such as comte’s [[law]] of three stages, spencer’s devel- opment scheme from the [[military]] to the industrial [[age]], and similar historico-philosophical constructions stand in the shadow of this [[great]] process. at the core of this astounding shift lies [[lie]] an el- emental impulse that has been decisive for centuries, i.e., the striv- ing for a neutral domain. following the hopeless theological dis- putes and stuggles of the sixteenth century, europeans [[european]] sought a neutral domain in which there would be no conﬂict and they could reach [[common]] agreement through the debates and ex- changes [[change]] of [[opinion]]. thereafter one no longer espoused the con- troversial concepts and arguments of [[christian]] theology and in- stead construed a “natural” [[system]] of theology, metaphysics, morality, and [[law]]. dilthey described this process of intellectual [[history]] in a justly famous exposition in which he emphasizes above all the [[great]] signiﬁcance of the stoic tradition. but the es- sential point for me is that theology, the former central domain, was abandoned because it was controversial, in favor of another
—neutral—domain. the former central domain became neutral- ized in that it ceased to be the central domain. on the basis of the new central domain, one hoped to ﬁnd minimum agreement and [[common]] premises allowing for the possibility of security, clarity, prudence, and [[peace]]. europeans [[european]] thus moved in the direction of neutralization  and  minimalization,  whereby  they  accepted the
90	carl schmitt
law which “kept them in line” for the following centuries and constituted their concept of [[truth]].
concepts elaborated over many centuries of theological re- ﬂection now became uninteresting and merely private matters. in the metaphysics of eighteenth century deism, [[god]] himself was re- moved from the [[world]] and reduced to a neutral instance vis-à-vis the struggles and antagonisms of real [[life]]. as hamann5 argued against kant, he became a concept and ceased to be an essence. in the nineteenth century, ﬁrst the monarch and then the [[state]] be- came a neutral [[power]], initiating a [[chapter]] in the [[history]] of politi- cal theology in the liberal doctrines of the pouvoir neutre and the stato neutrale in which the process of neutralization ﬁnds its clas- sical formula because it also has grasped what is most decisive: po- litical [[power]]. but in the dialectic of such a [[development]] one cre- ates a new domain of struggle precisely through the shifting of the central domain. in the new domain, at ﬁrst considered neu- tral, the antitheses of [[men]] and interests unfold with a new inten- sity and become increasingly sharper. europeans [[european]] always have wandered from a conﬂictual to a neutral domain, and always the newly won neutral domain has become immediately another arena of struggle, once again necessitating the search for a new neutral domain. scientiﬁc thinking was also unable to achieve [[peace]]. the [[religious]] wars [[war]] evolved into the still cultural yet already economically determined national wars [[war]] of the nineteenth century and, ﬁnally, into economic wars [[war]].
the  evidence  of  the  widespread  contemporary  [[belief]] in
technology is based only on the proposition that the absolute and ultimate neutral ground has been found in technology, since ap- parently there is nothing more neutral. technology serves every- one, just as radio is utilized for news of all kinds [[kind]] or as the postal service delivers packages regardless of their contents, since its technology can provide no criterion for evaluating them. unlike

the [[age]] of neutralizations and depoliticizations (1929)	91
theological, metaphysical, [[moral]], and even economic questions [[question]], which are forever debatable, purely technical problems have something refreshingly factual about them. they are easy to solve, and it is easily understandable why there is a tendency to take refuge in technicity from the inextricable problems of all other domains. here all peoples [[people]] and nations, all classes and religions [[religion]], all generations [[generation]] and races [[race]] appear to be able to agree because all make use of and take for granted the advantages and amenities of tech- nical comforts. thus this appears to be the ground of a general equalization, which max scheler advocated in a 1927 lecture.6 here all struggles and confusions of [[religious]], national, and social conﬂicts were leveled into a neutral domain. technology ap- peared to be a domain of [[peace]], understanding, and reconcilia- tion. the otherwise inexplicable link between paciﬁst and techni- cal [[belief]] is explained by this turn toward neutralization which the [[european]] [[mind]] took in the seventeenth century and which, as if by [[fate]], has been pursued into the twentieth century.
but the neutrality of technology is something other than the
neutrality of all former domains. technology is always only an in- strument and weapon; precisely because it serves all, it is not neu- tral. no [[single]] decision can be derived from the immanence of technology, least of all for neutrality. every type of [[culture]], every [[people]] and [[religion]], every [[war]] and [[peace]] can use technology as a weapon. given that instruments and [[weapons]] become ever more useful, the probability of their being used becomes that much greater. technical [[progress]] need not be either metaphysical or [[moral]] and not particularly economic to be [[progress]]. if humani- tarian-moral [[progress]] is still expected by many today from the

6 here schmitt is referring to a lecture scheler delivered on january 8, 1927 at the hochschule für politik in berlin and then again as part of a [[public]] lecture series at the [[university]] of cologne in the summer semester 1927. see “eigene lehre von ‘politik und moral’ (hauptgedanken),” in max scheler, schriften aus dem nachlass, vol. iv, “philosophie und geschichte,” edited by manfred s. frings (bonn: bouvier verlag, 1990), pp. 43 –76. cf. also in the same volume “bemer- kungen zu den manuskripten,” pp. 253ff.

perfection of technology, it is because technology is magically linked to morality on the somewhat naive assumption that the splendid array of contemporary technology will be used only as intended, i.e., sociologically, and that they themselves will control these frightful [[weapons]] and wield this monstrous [[power]]. but technology itself remains culturally blind. consequently, no con- clusions which usually can be drawn from the central domains of [[spiritual]] [[life]] can be derived from pure technology as nothing but technology—neither a concept of cultural [[progress]], nor a type of clerc or [[spiritual]] leader, nor a speciﬁc [[political]] [[system]].
so far the [[hope]] that a politically dominant elite would de- velop out of the [[community]] of technical inventors has not been fulﬁlled. the constructions of saint-simon and other sociologists who anticipated an “industrial” [[society]] are either not purely tech- nical (but rather mixed with humanitarian-moral and economic elements) or simply fantastic. not even the economic direction of the contemporary economy is in the hands of technicians, and un- til now nobody has been able to construe a social order [[led]] by technicians other than as one lacking any leadership or direction. even georges sorel did not remain an engineer; he became a clerc. no signiﬁcant technical invention can ever calculate its ob- jective [[political]] results. the inventions of the ﬁfteenth and six- teenth centuries produced liberating, individualistic, and rebel- lious developments. the invention of the printing press [[led]] to [[freedom]] of the press. today technical inventions are the means of the domination of the masses on a large scale. radio belongs to a broadcasting [[monopoly]]; ﬁlm, to the censor. the decision concern- ing [[freedom]] and [[slavery]] lies [[lie]] not in technology as such, which can be revolutionary or reactionary, can serve [[freedom]] or oppression, centralization or decentralization. neither a [[political]] [[question]] nor a [[political]] [[answer]] can be derived from purely technical principles [[principle]] and perspectives.
the previous [[german]] [[generation]] was under the spell of a cultural decline; it did not have to await the [[world]] [[war]], and cer- tainly not the 1918 collapse and spengler’s decline of the west. ex-
the [[age]] of neutralizations and depoliticizations (1929)	93
pressions of such a mood can be found in ernst troeltsch, max weber, and walter rathenau. the irresistible [[power]] of technology appears here as the domination of spiritlessness over spirit or, per- haps, as an ingenious but soulless mechanism. a [[european]] century which bewailed the maladie du siècle and awaited the domination of caliban or “after us the savage god” was succeeded by a ger- [[man]] [[generation]] which complained about a soulless [[age]] of technol- ogy in which the [[soul]] is helpless and powerless. in max scheler’s metaphysics of the powerless [[god]] or in leopold ziegler’s7 con- struction of a merely incidental, ﬂuctuating, and ultimately pow- erless elite there is still evidence of helplessness (be it of the [[soul]] or the spirit) vis-à-vis the [[age]] of technology.
the [[anxiety]] was legitimate because it sprang from dark feelings about the consequences of the just concluded process of neutralization. along with technology, intellectual neutrality had become intellectually meaningless. once everything had been ab- stracted from [[religion]] and theology, then from metaphysics and the [[state]], everything appeared to have been abstracted above all from [[culture]], ending in the neutrality of cultural [[death]]. whereas a vulgar mass [[religion]] predicated on the apparent neutrality of technology awaited [[human]] paradise, the [[greatest]] sociologists [[felt]] that the tendency which had dominated all stages of the [[modern]] [[european]] spirit now threatened [[culture]] itself. to this was added the [[anxiety]] of the new classes and masses which had arisen from the tabula rasa created by restless technicization. new and even alien masses threatening to traditional [[education]] and taste contin- ually arose from this cultural and social nothingness. but the anx- iety was ultimately nothing more than the [[doubt]] about the ability to control and utilize the marvelous instruments of the new tech- nology. a result of [[human]] understanding and specialized knowl- edge, such as a discipline and in particular [[modern]] technology, also cannot simply be presented as [[dead]] and soulless any more

than can the [[religion]] of technicity be confused with technology it- [[self]]. the spirit of technicity, which has [[led]] to the mass [[belief]] in an anti-religious activism, is still spirit; perhaps an [[evil]] and demonic spirit, but not one which can be dismissed as mechanistic and at- tributed to technology. it is perhaps something gruesome, but not itself technical and mechanical. it is the [[belief]] in an activistic metaphysics—the [[belief]] in unlimited [[power]] and the domination of [[man]] over [[nature]], even over [[human]] [[nature]]; the [[belief]] in the un- limited “receding of [[natural]] boundaries,” in the unlimited possi- bilities for [[change]] and [[prosperity]]. such a [[belief]] can be called fan- tastic and satanic, but not simply [[dead]], spiritless, or mechanized soullessness.

the [[fear]] of cultural and social nothingness sprang more from an anxiety-ridden panic over the threatened status quo than from a cool-headed [[knowledge]] of the peculiarity of intellectual processes and their dynamics. all new and [[great]] impulses, every [[revolution]] and reformation, every new elite originates from as- ceticism and voluntary or involuntary [[poverty]] (poverty meaning above all the renunciation of the security of the status quo). orig- inal [[christianity]] and all serious reforms within christianity—the benedictine, cluniac, and franciscan renewals, the baptists and the puritans—every [[genuine]] rebirth seeking to return to some original [[principle]], every [[genuine]] ritornar al principio, every return to pure, uncorrupted [[nature]] appears as cultural or social nothing- ness to the comfort and ease of the existing status quo. it grows silently and in darkness, and a historian or sociologist would rec- ognize only nothingness in its initial phases. the moment of bril- liant representation is also and at once the moment in which every link to the secret and inconspicuous beginning is endangered.


the process of continuous neutralization of various do- mains of cultural [[life]] has reached its end because technology is at hand. technology is no longer neutral ground in the sense of the
the [[age]] of neutralizations and depoliticizations (1929)	95
process of neutralization; every [[strong]] [[politics]] will make use of it. for this [[reason]], the [[present]] century can only be understood pro- visionally as the century of technology. how ultimately it should be understood will be revealed only when it is known which type of [[politics]] is [[strong]] enough to master the new technology and which type of [[genuine]] friend-enemy groupings can develop on this new ground.
great masses of industrialized peoples [[people]] today still cling to a torpid [[religion]] of technicity because they, like all masses, seek rad- ical results and [[believe]] subconsciously that the absolute depoliti- cization sought after four centuries can be found here and that universal [[peace]] begins here. yet technology can do nothing more than intensify [[peace]] or [[war]]; it is equally available to both. in this [[respect]], nothing changes [[change]] by speaking in the name of and employ- ing the magic formula of [[peace]]. today we see through the fog of names and words with which the psycho-technical machinery of mass suggestion works [[work]].
today we even recognize the secret [[law]] of this vocabulary and [[know]] that the most terrible [[war]] is pursued only in the name of [[peace]], the most terrible oppression only in the name of free- dom, the most terrible inhumanity only in the name of [[humanity]]. finally, we also see through the mood of that [[generation]] which saw only [[spiritual]] [[death]] or a soulless mechanism in the [[age]] of technicity. we recognize the pluralism of [[spiritual]] [[life]] and [[know]] that the central domain of [[spiritual]] existence cannot be a neutral domain and that it is [[wrong]] to solve a [[political]] problem with the antithesis of organic and mechanistic, [[life]] and [[death]]. a [[life]] which has only [[death]] as its antithesis is no longer [[life]] but powerlessness and helplessness. whoever knows [[know]] no other [[enemy]] than [[death]] and recognizes in his [[enemy]] nothing more than an empty mechanism is nearer to [[death]] than [[life]]. the comfortable antithesis of the or- ganic and the mechanistic is itself something crudely mechanistic. a grouping which sees on the one side only spirit and [[life]] and on the other only [[death]] and mechanism signiﬁes nothing more than a renunciation of the struggle and amounts to nothing more than

a romantic lament. for [[life]] struggles not with [[death]], spirit not with spiritlessness; spirit struggles with spirit, [[life]] with [[life]], and out of the [[power]] of an integral understanding of this arises the or- der of [[human]] things. ab integro nascitur ordo.8

8 schmitt abbreviates the ﬁfth line of virgil’s eclogue iv, which reads, “magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo,” often rendered, “a new [[world]] or- der is born,” or “a [[great]] order of the ages [[age]] is born anew.” in the context of schmitt’s remarks here, the abridgement could be interpreted to mean, “from integrity or- der is born” or “an order is born from renewal.”
