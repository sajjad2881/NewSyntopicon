act i

scene i. elsinore. a platform before the castle.

 enter francisco and barnardo, two sentinels.

barnardo. who’s there?

francisco. nay, [[answer]] me. stand and unfold yourself.

barnardo. long [[live]] the king!

francisco. barnardo?

barnardo. he.

francisco. you come most carefully upon your hour.

barnardo. ’tis now struck twelve. get thee to bed, francisco.

francisco. for this relief much thanks. ’tis bitter cold, and i am sick
at [[heart]].

barnardo. have you had quiet guard?

francisco. not a mouse stirring.

barnardo. well, [[good]] night. if you do meet horatio and marcellus, the
rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

 enter horatio and marcellus.

francisco. i [[think]] i hear them. stand, ho! who is there?

horatio. [[friends]] to this ground.

marcellus. and liegemen to the dane.

francisco. give you [[good]] night.

marcellus. o, farewell, honest soldier, who hath reliev’d you?

francisco. barnardo has my place. give you good-night.

 [_exit._]

marcellus. holla, barnardo!

barnardo. say, what, is horatio there?

horatio. a piece of him.

barnardo. welcome, horatio. welcome, [[good]] marcellus.

marcellus. what, has this thing appear’d again tonight?

barnardo. i have seen nothing.

marcellus. horatio says ’tis but our fantasy, and will not let belief
take hold of him touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of
this night, that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes
and speak to it.

horatio. tush, tush, ’twill not appear.

barnardo. sit down awhile, and let us once again assail your ears, that
are so fortified against our story, what we two nights have seen.

horatio. well, sit we down, and let us hear barnardo speak of this.

barnardo. [[last]] night of all, when yond same star that’s westward from
the pole, had made his course t’illume that part of [[heaven]] where now it
burns, marcellus and myself, the bell then beating one—

marcellus. [[peace]], break thee off. look where it comes again.

 enter ghost.

barnardo. in the same figure, like the [[king]] that’s [[dead]].

marcellus. thou art [[arts]] a scholar; speak to it, horatio.

barnardo. looks it not like the [[king]]? mark it, horatio.

horatio. most like. it harrows me with [[fear]] and wonder.

barnardo it would be spoke to.

marcellus. [[question]] it, horatio.

horatio. what art [[arts]] thou that usurp’st this [[time]] of night, together with
that [[fair]] and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did
sometimes march? by [[heaven]] i charge thee speak.

marcellus. it is offended.

barnardo. see, it stalks away.

horatio. stay! speak, speak! i charge thee speak!

 [_exit ghost._]

marcellus. ’tis gone, and will not [[answer]].

barnardo. how now, horatio! you tremble and look pale. is not this
something more than fantasy? what [[think]] you on’t?

horatio. before my [[god]], i might not this [[believe]] without the sensible
and true avouch of mine own [[eyes]].

marcellus. is it not like the [[king]]?

horatio. as thou art [[arts]] to thyself: such was the very armour he had on
when he th’ambitious norway combated; so frown’d he once, when in an
angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice. ’tis [[strange]].

marcellus. thus twice before, and jump at this [[dead]] hour, with martial
stalk hath he gone by our watch.

horatio. in what particular [[thought]] to [[work]] i [[know]] not; but in the
gross and scope of my [[opinion]], this bodes some [[strange]] eruption to our
state.

marcellus. [[good]] now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows [[know]], why this
same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the [[subject]] of
the [[land]], and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and [[foreign]] mart for
implements of [[war]]; why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
does not divide the sunday from the week. what might be toward, that
this sweaty haste doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: who
is’t that can inform me?

horatio. that can i; at least, the whisper goes so. our [[last]] [[king]],
whose image even but now appear’d to us, was, as you [[know]], by
fortinbras of norway, thereto prick’d on by a most emulate [[pride]], dar’d
to the combat; in which our valiant hamlet, for so this side of our
known [[world]] esteem’d him, did slay this fortinbras; who by a seal’d
compact, well ratified by [[law]] and heraldry, did forfeit, with his [[life]],
all those his lands [[land]] which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror; against
the which, a moiety competent was gaged by our [[king]]; which had return’d
to the [[inheritance]] of fortinbras, had he been vanquisher; as by the
same cov’nant and carriage of the article design’d, his fell to hamlet.
now, sir, [[young]] fortinbras, of unimproved mettle, hot and full, hath in
the skirts of norway, here and there, shark’d up a list of lawless
resolutes, for food and diet, to some enterprise that hath a stomach
in’t; which is no other, as it doth well appear unto our [[state]], but to
recover of us by [[strong]] hand and terms compulsatory, those foresaid
lands so by his [[father]] lost. and this, i take it, is the main motive of
our preparations, the source of this our watch, and the [[chief]] head of
this post-haste and rummage in the [[land]].

barnardo. i [[think]] it be no other but e’en so: well may it sort that
this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king
that was and is the [[question]] of these wars [[war]].

horatio. a mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye. in the most high and
palmy [[state]] of [[rome]], a little ere the mightiest julius fell, the graves
stood tenantless and the sheeted [[dead]] did squeak and gibber in the
roman streets; as stars with trains of [[fire]] and dews of [[blood]],
disasters in the sun; and the moist star, upon whose influence
neptune’s [[empire]] stands, was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. and
even the like precurse of fierce events, as harbingers preceding still
the fates [[fate]] and prologue to the omen coming on, have [[heaven]] and earth
together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen.

 re-enter ghost.

but, soft, behold! lo, where it comes again! i’ll cross it, though it
blast me. stay, illusion! if thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
speak to me. if there be any [[good]] thing to be done, that may to thee do
ease, and grace to me, speak to me. if thou art [[arts]] privy to thy country’s
fate, which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, o speak! or if thou hast
uphoarded in thy [[life]] extorted treasure in the womb of [[earth]], for
which, they say, you spirits oft walk in [[death]], speak of it. stay, and
speak!

 [_the cock crows._]

stop it, marcellus!

marcellus. shall i strike at it with my partisan?

horatio. do, if it will not stand.

barnardo. ’tis here!

horatio. ’tis here!

 [_exit ghost._]

marcellus. ’tis gone! we do it [[wrong]], being so majestical, to offer it
the show of [[violence]], for it is as the air, invulnerable, and our vain
blows malicious mockery.

barnardo. it was about to speak, when the cock crew.

horatio. and then it started, like a guilty thing upon a fearful
summons. i have heard the cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, doth
with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat awake the [[god]] of day; and at
his warning, whether in sea or [[fire]], in [[earth]] or air, th’extravagant
and erring spirit hies to his confine. and of the [[truth]] herein this
present object made probation.

marcellus. it faded on the crowing of the cock. some say that ever
’gainst that season comes wherein our saviour’s birth is celebrated,
the bird of dawning singeth all night long; and then, they say, no
spirit dare stir abroad, the nights are wholesome, then no planets
strike, no fairy takes, nor witch hath [[power]] to charm; so hallow’d and
so gracious is the [[time]].

horatio. so have i heard, and do in part [[believe]] it. but look, the morn
in russet mantle clad, walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
break we our watch up, and by my [[advice]], let us impart what we have
seen tonight unto [[young]] hamlet; for upon my [[life]], this spirit, dumb to
us, will speak to him. do you [[consent]] we shall acquaint him with it, as
needful in our loves [[love]], fitting our [[duty]]?

marcellus. let’s do’t, i [[pray]], and i this morning [[know]] where we shall
find him most conveniently.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. elsinore. a room of [[state]] in the castle.

 enter claudius [[king]] of denmark, gertrude the queen, hamlet, polonius,
 laertes, voltemand, cornelius, lords [[lord]] and attendant.

king. though yet of hamlet our dear brother’s [[death]] the memory be
green, and that it us befitted to bear our hearts [[heart]] in [[grief]], and our
whole [[kingdom]] to be contracted in one brow of woe; yet so far hath
discretion fought with [[nature]] that we with wisest [[sorrow]] [[think]] on him,
together with remembrance of ourselves. therefore our sometime sister,
now our queen, th’imperial jointress to this warlike [[state]], have we, as
’twere with a defeated joy, with one auspicious and one dropping eye,
with mirth in [[funeral]], and with dirge in [[marriage]], in [[equal]] scale
weighing delight and dole, taken to [[wife]]; nor have we herein barr’d
your [[better]] wisdoms, which have freely gone with this affair along. for
all, our thanks. now follows, that you [[know]] [[young]] fortinbras, holding a
weak supposal of our worth, or thinking by our late dear brother’s
death our [[state]] to be disjoint and out of frame, colleagued with this
dream of his advantage, he hath not fail’d to pester us with message,
importing the [[surrender]] of those lands [[land]] lost by his [[father]], with all
bonds of [[law]], to our most valiant [[brother]]. so much for him. now for
ourself and for this [[time]] of meeting: thus much the [[business]] is: we
have here writ to norway, uncle of [[young]] fortinbras, who, impotent and
bed-rid, scarcely hears of this his nephew’s [[purpose]], to suppress his
further gait herein; in that the levies, the lists, and full
proportions are all made out of his [[subject]]: and we here dispatch you,
good cornelius, and you, voltemand, for bearers of this greeting to old
norway, giving to you no further personal [[power]] to [[business]] with the
king, more than the scope of these dilated articles allow. farewell;
and let your haste commend your [[duty]].

cornelius and voltemand. in that, and all things, will we show our
duty.

king. we [[doubt]] it nothing: heartily farewell.

 [_exeunt voltemand and cornelius._]

and now, laertes, what’s the news with you? you told us of some suit.
what is’t, laertes? you cannot speak of [[reason]] to the dane, and lose
your voice. what wouldst thou beg, laertes, that shall not be my offer,
not thy asking? the head is not more native to the [[heart]], the hand more
instrumental to the mouth, than is the [[throne]] of denmark to thy [[father]].
what wouldst thou have, laertes?

laertes. dread my [[lord]], your leave and favour to return to [[france]], from
whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my [[duty]] in your
coronation; yet now i must confess, that [[duty]] done, my thoughts [[thought]] and
wishes bend again toward [[france]], and bow them to your gracious leave
and pardon.

king. have you your father’s leave? what says polonius?

polonius. he hath, my [[lord]], wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome
petition; and at [[last]] upon his will i seal’d my hard [[consent]]. i do
beseech you give him leave to go.

king. take thy [[fair]] hour, laertes; [[time]] be thine, and thy [[best]] graces
spend it at thy will! but now, my cousin hamlet, and my son—

hamlet. [_aside._] a little more than kin, and less than [[kind]].

king. how is it that the clouds still hang on you?

hamlet. not so, my [[lord]], i am too much i’ the sun.

queen. [[good]] hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, and let thine eye look
like a friend on denmark. do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for
thy [[noble]] [[father]] in the dust. thou know’st ’tis [[common]], all that lives
must [[die]], passing through [[nature]] to eternity.

hamlet. ay, madam, it is [[common]].

queen. if it be, why seems it so particular with thee?

hamlet. seems, madam! nay, it is; i [[know]] not seems. ’tis not alone my
inky cloak, [[good]] [[mother]], nor customary suits of solemn black, nor windy
suspiration of forc’d breath, no, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
nor the dejected haviour of the visage, together with all forms, moods,
shows of [[grief]], that can denote me truly. these indeed seem, for they
are actions that a [[man]] might play; but i have that within which passeth
show; these but the trappings and the suits of woe.

king. ’tis sweet and commendable in your [[nature]], hamlet, to give these
mourning duties [[duty]] to your [[father]]; but you must [[know]], your [[father]] lost a
father, that [[father]] lost, lost his, and the survivor bound in filial
obligation, for some term to do obsequious [[sorrow]]. but to persevere in
obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness. ’tis unmanly
grief, it shows a will most incorrect to [[heaven]], a [[heart]] unfortified, a
mind impatient, an understanding simple and unschool’d; for what we
know must be, and is as [[common]] as any the most vulgar thing to sense,
why should we in our peevish opposition take it to [[heart]]? fie, ’tis a
fault to [[heaven]], a [[fault]] against the [[dead]], a [[fault]] to [[nature]], to reason
most absurd, whose [[common]] theme is [[death]] of fathers [[father]], and who still hath
cried, from the first corse till he that died today, ‘this must be so.’
we [[pray]] you throw to [[earth]] this unprevailing woe, and [[think]] of us as of
a [[father]]; for let the [[world]] take note you are the most immediate to our
throne, and with no less nobility of [[love]] than that which dearest
father bears his [[son]] do i impart toward you. for your intent in going
back to school in wittenberg, it is most retrograde to our [[desire]]: and
we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our
eye, our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our [[son]].

queen. let not thy [[mother]] lose her prayers, hamlet. i [[pray]] thee stay
with us; go not to wittenberg.

hamlet. i shall in all my [[best]] obey you, madam.

king. why, ’tis a loving and a [[fair]] reply. be as ourself in denmark.
madam, come; this gentle and unforc’d accord of hamlet sits smiling to
my [[heart]]; in grace whereof, no jocund health that denmark drinks today
but the [[great]] cannon to the clouds shall tell, and the king’s rouse the
heaven shall bruit again, re-speaking earthly thunder. come away.

 [_exeunt all but hamlet._]

hamlet. o that this too too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve
itself into a dew! or that the everlasting had not fix’d his canon
’gainst self-slaughter. o god! o god! how weary, stale, flat, and
unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world! fie on’t! oh fie!
’tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed; things rank and gross in
nature possess it merely. that it should come to this! but two months
dead—nay, not so much, not two: so excellent a [[king]]; that was to this
hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my [[mother]], that he might not beteem
the winds of [[heaven]] visit her face too roughly. [[heaven]] and earth! must
i [[remember]]? why, she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had
grown by what it fed on; and yet, within a month— let me not think
on’t—frailty, thy name is woman! a little month, or ere those shoes
were old with which she followed my [[poor]] father’s [[body]] like niobe, all
tears.—why she, even she— o god! a beast that wants discourse of reason
would have mourn’d longer,—married with mine uncle, my father’s
brother; but no more like my [[father]] than i to hercules. within a month?
ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her
galled [[eyes]], she [[married]]. o most wicked speed, to post with such
dexterity to incestuous sheets! it is not, nor it cannot come to [[good]].
but break my [[heart]], for i must hold my tongue.

 enter horatio, marcellus and barnardo.

horatio. hail to your lordship!

hamlet. i am glad to see you well: horatio, or i do forget myself.

horatio. the same, my [[lord]], and your [[poor]] servant ever.

hamlet. sir, my [[good]] friend; i’ll [[change]] that name with you: and what
make you from wittenberg, horatio?— marcellus?

marcellus. my [[good]] [[lord]].

hamlet. i am very glad to see you.—good even, sir.— but what, in [[faith]],
make you from wittenberg?

horatio. a truant disposition, [[good]] my [[lord]].

hamlet. i would not hear your [[enemy]] say so; nor shall you do my ear
that [[violence]], to make it truster of your own report against yourself.
i [[know]] you are no truant. but what is your affair in elsinore? we’ll
teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

horatio. my [[lord]], i came to see your father’s [[funeral]].

hamlet. i prithee do not mock me, fellow-student. i [[think]] it was to see
my mother’s wedding.

horatio. indeed, my [[lord]], it follow’d hard upon.

hamlet. thrift, thrift, horatio! the [[funeral]] bak’d meats did coldly
furnish forth the [[marriage]] tables. would i had met my dearest foe in
heaven or ever i had seen that day, horatio. my [[father]],—methinks i see
my [[father]].

horatio. where, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. in my mind’s eye, horatio.

horatio. i saw him once; he was a goodly [[king]].

hamlet. he was a [[man]], take him for all in all, i shall not look upon
his like again.

horatio. my [[lord]], i [[think]] i saw him yesternight.

hamlet. saw? who?

horatio. my [[lord]], the [[king]] your [[father]].

hamlet. the [[king]] my father!

horatio. season your admiration for a while with an attent ear, till i
may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you.

hamlet. for [[god’s]] [[love]] let me hear.

horatio. two nights together had these gentlemen, marcellus and
barnardo, on their watch in the [[dead]] waste and middle of the night,
been thus encounter’d. a figure like your [[father]], armed at point
exactly, cap-à-pie, appears before them, and with solemn march goes
slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d by their oppress’d and
fear-surprised [[eyes]], within his truncheon’s length; whilst they,
distill’d almost to jelly with the act of [[fear]], stand dumb, and speak
not to him. this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did, and i with
them the third night kept the watch, where, as they had deliver’d, both
in [[time]], form of the thing, each word made true and [[good]], the
apparition comes. i knew your [[father]]; these hands are not more like.

hamlet. but where was this?

marcellus. my [[lord]], upon the platform where we watch.

hamlet. did you not speak to it?

horatio. my [[lord]], i did; but [[answer]] made it none: yet once methought it
lifted up it head, and did address itself to motion, like as it would
speak. but even then the morning cock crew loud, and at the sound it
shrunk in haste away, and vanish’d from our sight.

hamlet. ’tis very [[strange]].

horatio. as i do [[live]], my honour’d [[lord]], ’tis true; and we did [[think]] it
writ down in our [[duty]] to let you [[know]] of it.

hamlet. indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. hold you the watch
tonight?

mar. and barnardo. we do, my [[lord]].

hamlet. arm’d, say you?

both. arm’d, my [[lord]].

hamlet. from top to toe?

both. my [[lord]], from head to foot.

hamlet. then saw you not his face?

horatio. o yes, my [[lord]], he wore his beaver up.

hamlet. what, look’d he frowningly?

horatio. a countenance more in [[sorrow]] than in anger.

hamlet. pale, or red?

horatio. nay, very pale.

hamlet. and fix’d his [[eyes]] upon you?

horatio. most constantly.

hamlet. i would i had been there.

horatio. it would have much amaz’d you.

hamlet. very like, very like. stay’d it long?

horatio. while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

marcellus and barnardo. longer, longer.

horatio. not when i saw’t.

hamlet. his beard was grizzled, no?

horatio. it was, as i have seen it in his [[life]], a sable silver’d.

hamlet. i will watch tonight; perchance ’twill walk again.

horatio. i warrant you it will.

hamlet. if it assume my [[noble]] father’s [[person]], i’ll speak to it, though
hell itself should gape and bid me hold my [[peace]]. i [[pray]] you all, if
you have hitherto conceal’d this sight, let it be tenable in your
silence still; and whatsoever else shall hap tonight, give it an
understanding, but no tongue. i will requite your loves [[love]]. so, fare ye
well. upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve, i’ll visit you.

all. our [[duty]] to your [[honour]].

hamlet. your loves [[love]], as mine to you: farewell.

 [_exeunt horatio, marcellus and barnardo._]

my father’s spirit in arms! all is not well; i [[doubt]] some foul play:
would the night were come! till then sit still, my [[soul]]: foul deeds
will rise, though all the [[earth]] o’erwhelm them, to [[men’s]] [[eyes]].

 [_exit._]

scene iii. a room in polonius’s house.

 enter laertes and ophelia.

laertes. my necessaries are embark’d. farewell. and, sister, as the
winds give benefit and convoy is assistant, do not sleep, but let me
hear from you.

ophelia. do you [[doubt]] that?

laertes. for hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, hold it a fashion
and a toy in [[blood]]; a violet in the [[youth]] of primy [[nature]], forward, not
permanent, sweet, not lasting; the perfume and suppliance of a minute;
no more.

ophelia. no more but so?

laertes. [[think]] it no more. for [[nature]] crescent does not grow alone in
thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, the inward service of the
mind and [[soul]] grows wide withal. perhaps he loves [[love]] you now, and now no
soil nor cautel doth besmirch the [[virtue]] of his will; but you must
fear, his greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own; for he himself is
subject to his birth: he may not, as unvalu’d persons [[person]] do, carve for
himself; for on his [[choice]] depends the [[sanctity]] and health of this
whole [[state]]; and therefore must his [[choice]] be circumscrib’d unto the
voice and yielding of that [[body]] whereof he is the head. then if he says
he loves [[love]] you, it fits your [[wisdom]] so far to [[believe]] it as he in his
particular act and place may give his saying deed; which is no further
than the main voice of denmark goes withal. then weigh what loss your
honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs [[song]], or lose
your [[heart]], or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster’d importunity.
fear it, ophelia, [[fear]] it, my dear sister; and keep you in the rear of
your affection, out of the shot and danger of [[desire]]. the chariest maid
is prodigal enough if she unmask her [[beauty]] to the moon. [[virtue]] itself
scopes not calumnious strokes: the canker galls the infants of the
spring too oft before their buttons be disclos’d, and in the morn and
liquid dew of [[youth]] contagious blastments are most imminent. be wary
then, [[best]] safety lies [[lie]] in [[fear]]. [[youth]] to itself rebels, though none
else near.

ophelia. i shall th’effect of this [[good]] lesson keep as watchman to my
heart. but [[good]] my [[brother]], do not as some ungracious [[pastors]] do, show
me the steep and thorny way to [[heaven]]; whilst like a puff’d and
reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, and
recks not his own rede.

laertes. o, [[fear]] me not. i stay too long. but here my [[father]] comes.

 enter polonius.

a double blessing is a double grace; [[occasion]] smiles upon a second
leave.

polonius. yet here, laertes? aboard, aboard, for shame. the wind sits
in the shoulder of your sail, and you are stay’d for. there, my
blessing with you.

 [_laying his hand on laertes’s head._]

and these few precepts in thy memory look thou [[character]]. give thy
thoughts no tongue, nor any unproportion’d [[thought]] his act. be thou
familiar, but by no means vulgar. those [[friends]] thou hast, and their
adoption tried, grapple them unto thy [[soul]] with hoops of steel; but do
not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d
comrade. beware of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, bear’t that
th’opposed may beware of thee. give every [[man]] thine ear, but few thy
voice: take each man’s censure, but reserve thy [[judgment]]. costly thy
habit as thy purse can buy, but not express’d in fancy; [[rich]], not
gaudy: for the apparel oft proclaims the [[man]]; and they in [[france]] of the
best rank and station are of a most select and generous [[chief]] in that.
neither a borrower nor a lender be: for loan oft loses both itself and
friend; and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. this above all: to
thine own [[self]] be true; and it must [[follow]], as the night the day, thou
canst not then be false to any [[man]]. farewell: my blessing season this
in thee.

laertes. most humbly do i take my leave, my [[lord]].

polonius. the [[time]] invites you; go, your servants tend.

laertes. farewell, ophelia, and [[remember]] well what i have said to you.

ophelia. ’tis in my memory lock’d, and you yourself shall keep the key
of it.

laertes. farewell.

 [_exit._]

polonius. what is’t, ophelia, he hath said to you?

ophelia. so please you, something touching the [[lord]] hamlet.

polonius. [[marry]], well bethought: ’tis told me he hath very oft of late
given private [[time]] to you; and you yourself have of your audience been
most [[free]] and bounteous. if it be so,—as so ’tis put on me, and that in
way of caution,—i must tell you you do not [[understand]] yourself so
clearly as it behoves my [[daughter]] and your [[honour]]. what is between you?
give me up the [[truth]].

ophelia. he hath, my [[lord]], of late made many tenders of his affection
to me.

polonius. affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl, unsifted in
such perilous circumstance. do you [[believe]] his tenders, as you call
them?

ophelia. i do not [[know]], my [[lord]], what i should [[think]].

polonius. [[marry]], i’ll [[teach]] you; [[think]] yourself a baby; that you have
ta’en these tenders for true [[pay]], which are not sterling. tender
yourself more dearly; or,—not to crack the wind of the [[poor]] phrase,
roaming it thus,—you’ll tender me a [[fool]].

ophelia. my [[lord]], he hath importun’d me with [[love]] in honourable
fashion.

polonius. ay, [[fashion]] you may call it; go to, go to.

ophelia. and hath given countenance to his [[speech]], my [[lord]], with almost
all the holy vows of [[heaven]].

polonius. ay, springes to catch woodcocks. i do [[know]], when the blood
burns, how prodigal the [[soul]] lends the tongue vows: these blazes,
daughter, giving more [[light]] than heat, extinct in both, even in their
promise, as it is a-making, you must not take for [[fire]]. from this time
be something scanter of your maiden presence; set your entreatments at
a higher rate than a command to parley. for [[lord]] hamlet, [[believe]] so
much in him that he is [[young]]; and with a larger tether may he walk than
may be given you. in few, ophelia, do not [[believe]] his vows; for they
are brokers, not of that dye which their investments show, but mere
implorators of unholy suits, breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
the [[better]] to beguile. this is for all. i would not, in plain terms,
from this [[time]] forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give
words or talk with the [[lord]] hamlet. look to’t, i charge you; come your
ways.

ophelia. i shall obey, my [[lord]].

 [_exeunt._]

scene iv. the platform.

 enter hamlet, horatio and marcellus.

hamlet. the air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

horatio. it is a nipping and an eager air.

hamlet. what hour now?

horatio. i [[think]] it lacks of twelve.

marcellus. no, it is struck.

horatio. indeed? i heard it not. it then draws near the season wherein
the spirit held his wont to walk.

 [_a flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within._]

what does this mean, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. the [[king]] doth wake tonight and takes his rouse, keeps wassail,
and the swaggering upspring reels; and as he drains his draughts of
rhenish down, the kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of
his pledge.

horatio. is it a custom?

hamlet. ay [[marry]] is’t; and to my [[mind]], though i am native here, and to
the manner born, it is a custom more honour’d in the breach than the
observance. this heavy-headed revel east and west makes us traduc’d and
tax’d of other nations: they clepe us drunkards, and with swinish
phrase soil our addition; and indeed it takes from our achievements,
though perform’d at height, the pith and marrow of our attribute. so
oft it chances [[chance]] in particular [[men]] that for some vicious mole of nature
in them, as in their birth, wherein they are not guilty, since nature
cannot choose his origin, by their o’ergrowth of some [[complexion]], oft
breaking down the pales and forts of [[reason]]; or by some habit, that too
much o’erleavens the form of plausive manners;—that these [[men]],
carrying, i say, the stamp of one defect, being nature’s livery or
fortune’s star,— his virtues [[virtue]] else,—be they as pure as grace, as
infinite as [[man]] may undergo, shall in the general censure take
corruption from that particular [[fault]]. the dram of [[evil]] doth all the
noble substance often [[doubt]] to his own scandal.

horatio. look, my [[lord]], it comes!

 enter ghost.

hamlet. angels and ministers of grace defend us! be thou a spirit of
health or goblin damn’d, bring with thee airs from [[heaven]] or blasts
from hell, be thy intents wicked or charitable, thou com’st in such a
questionable shape that i will speak to thee. i’ll call thee hamlet,
king, [[father]], [[royal]] dane. o, [[answer]] me! let me not burst in ignorance;
but tell why thy canoniz’d bones, hearsed in [[death]], have burst their
cerements; why the sepulchre, wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d, hath
op’d his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again! what may this
mean, that thou, [[dead]] corse, again in complete steel, revisit’st thus
the glimpses of the moon, making night hideous, and we fools [[fool]] of nature
so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts [[thought]] beyond the reaches
of our souls [[soul]]? say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?

 [_ghost beckons hamlet._]

horatio. it beckons you to go away with it, as if it some impartment
did [[desire]] to you alone.

marcellus. look with what courteous action it waves you to a more
removed ground. but do not go with it.

horatio. no, by no means.

hamlet. it will not speak; then will i [[follow]] it.

horatio. do not, my [[lord]].

hamlet. why, what should be the [[fear]]? i do not set my [[life]] at a pin’s
fee; and for my [[soul]], what can it do to that, being a thing [[immortal]] as
itself? it waves me forth again. i’ll [[follow]] it.

horatio. what if it tempt you toward the flood, my [[lord]], or to the
dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o’er his base into the sea,
and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your
sovereignty of [[reason]], and draw you into madness? [[think]] of it. the very
place puts toys of desperation, without more motive, into every brain
that looks so many fadoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath.

hamlet. it waves me still. go on, i’ll [[follow]] thee.

marcellus. you shall not go, my [[lord]].

hamlet. hold off your hands.

horatio. be rul’d; you shall not go.

hamlet. my [[fate]] cries out, and makes each petty artery in this [[body]] as
hardy as the nemean lion’s nerve.

 [_ghost beckons._]

still am i call’d. unhand me, gentlemen.

 [_breaking [[free]] from them._]

by [[heaven]], i’ll make a ghost of him that lets me. i say, away!—go on,
i’ll [[follow]] thee.

 [_exeunt ghost and hamlet._]

horatio. he waxes desperate with [[imagination]].

marcellus. let’s [[follow]]; ’tis not fit thus to obey him.

horatio. have after. to what issue will this come?

marcellus. something is rotten in the [[state]] of denmark.

horatio. [[heaven]] will direct it.

marcellus. nay, let’s [[follow]] him.

 [_exeunt._]

scene v. a more remote part of the castle.

 enter ghost and hamlet.

hamlet. whither wilt thou lead me? speak, i’ll go no further.

ghost. mark me.

hamlet. i will.

ghost. my hour is almost come, when i to sulph’rous and tormenting
flames must render up myself.

hamlet. alas, [[poor]] ghost!

ghost. [[pity]] me not, but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall
unfold.

hamlet. speak, i am bound to hear.

ghost. so art [[arts]] thou to [[revenge]], when thou shalt hear.

hamlet. what?

ghost. i am thy father’s spirit, doom’d for a [[certain]] term to walk the
night, and for the day confin’d to fast in fires [[fire]], till the foul crimes
done in my days of [[nature]] are burnt and purg’d away. but that i am
forbid to tell the secrets of my prison-house, i could a tale unfold
whose lightest word would harrow up thy [[soul]]; freeze thy [[young]] [[blood]],
make thy two [[eyes]] like stars start from their spheres, thy knotted and
combined locks to part, and each particular hair to stand on end like
quills upon the fretful porcupine. but this eternal blazon must not be
to ears of flesh and [[blood]]. list, list, o, list! if thou didst ever thy
dear [[father]] love—

hamlet. o god!

ghost. [[revenge]] his foul and most unnatural murder.

hamlet. murder!

ghost. murder most foul, as in the [[best]] it is; but this most foul,
strange, and unnatural.

hamlet. haste me to know’t, that i, with wings as swift as meditation
or the thoughts [[thought]] of [[love]] may sweep to my [[revenge]].

ghost. i find thee apt; and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf, wouldst thou not stir in this.
now, hamlet, hear. ’tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, a
serpent stung me; so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of
my [[death]] rankly abus’d; but [[know]], thou [[noble]] [[youth]], the serpent that
did sting thy father’s [[life]] now wears his [[crown]].

hamlet. o my prophetic soul! mine uncle!

ghost. ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, with witchcraft of
his wit, with traitorous gifts,— o wicked wit, and gifts, that have the
power so to seduce!—won to his shameful [[lust]] the will of my most
seeming-virtuous queen. o hamlet, what a falling off was there, from
me, whose [[love]] was of that [[dignity]] that it went hand in hand even with
the vow i made to her in [[marriage]]; and to decline upon a wretch whose
natural gifts were [[poor]] to those of mine. but [[virtue]], as it never will
be mov’d, though lewdness court it in a shape of [[heaven]]; so [[lust]],
though to a radiant angel link’d, will sate itself in a celestial bed
and prey on garbage. but soft! methinks i scent the morning air; brief
let me be. sleeping within my orchard, my custom always of the
afternoon, upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed
hebenon in a vial, and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous
distilment, whose effect holds such an enmity with [[blood]] of [[man]] that
swift as quicksilver it courses through the [[natural]] gates and alleys of
the [[body]]; and with a sudden vigour it doth posset and curd, like eager
droppings into milk, the thin and wholesome [[blood]]. so did it mine; and
a most instant tetter bark’d about, most lazar-like, with vile and
loathsome crust all my smooth [[body]]. thus was i, sleeping, by a
brother’s hand, of [[life]], of [[crown]], of queen at once dispatch’d: cut off
even in the blossoms of my [[sin]], unhous’led, disappointed, unanel’d; no
reckoning made, but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my
head. o horrible! o horrible! most horrible! if thou hast [[nature]] in
thee, bear it not; let not the [[royal]] bed of denmark be a couch for
luxury and damned incest. but howsoever thou pursu’st this act, taint
not thy [[mind]], nor let thy [[soul]] contrive against thy [[mother]] aught; leave
her to [[heaven]], and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, to prick
and sting her. fare thee well at once! the glow-worm shows the matin to
be near, and ’gins to pale his uneffectual [[fire]]. adieu, adieu, adieu.
hamlet, [[remember]] me.

 [_exit._]

hamlet. o all you host of heaven! o earth! what else? and shall i
couple hell? o, fie! hold, my [[heart]]; and you, my sinews, grow not
instant old, but bear me stiffly up. [[remember]] thee? ay, thou poor
ghost, while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe. remember
thee? yea, from the table of my memory i’ll wipe away all trivial fond
records, all saws of books [[book]], all forms, all pressures [[past]], that youth
and observation copied there; and thy commandment all alone shall live
within the [[book]] and volume of my brain, unmix’d with baser matter. yes,
by heaven! o most pernicious woman! o villain, villain, smiling damned
villain! my tables. meet it is i set it down, that one may smile, and
smile, and be a villain! at least i am sure it may be so in denmark.

 [_writing._]

so, uncle, there you are. now to my word; it is ‘adieu, adieu, remember
me.’ i have sworn’t.

horatio and marcellus. [_within._] my [[lord]], my [[lord]].

marcellus. [_within._] [[lord]] hamlet.

horatio. [_within._] [[heaven]] secure him.

hamlet. so be it!

marcellus. [_within._] illo, ho, ho, my lord!

hamlet. hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.

 enter horatio and marcellus.

marcellus. how is’t, my [[noble]] [[lord]]?

horatio. what news, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. o, wonderful!

horatio. [[good]] my [[lord]], tell it.

hamlet. no, you’ll reveal it.

horatio. not i, my [[lord]], by [[heaven]].

marcellus. nor i, my [[lord]].

hamlet. how say you then, would [[heart]] of [[man]] once [[think]] it?— but you’ll
be secret?

horatio and marcellus. ay, by [[heaven]], my [[lord]].

hamlet. there’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all denmark but he’s an
arrant knave.

horatio. there needs no ghost, my [[lord]], come from the grave to tell us
this.

hamlet. why, [[right]]; you are i’ the [[right]]; and so, without more
circumstance at all, i hold it fit that we shake hands and part: you,
as your [[business]] and desires [[desire]] shall point you,— for every [[man]] hath
business and [[desire]], such as it is;—and for my own [[poor]] part, look you,
i’ll go [[pray]].

horatio. these are but wild and whirling words, my [[lord]].

hamlet. i’m [[sorry]] they offend you, heartily; yes [[faith]], heartily.

horatio. there’s no offence, my [[lord]].

hamlet. yes, by saint patrick, but there is, horatio, and much offence
too. touching this vision here, it is an honest ghost, that let me tell
you. for your [[desire]] to [[know]] what is between us, o’ermaster’t as you
may. and now, [[good]] [[friends]], as you are [[friends]], scholars, and soldiers,
give me one [[poor]] request.

horatio. what is’t, my [[lord]]? we will.

hamlet. never make known what you have seen tonight.

horatio and marcellus. my [[lord]], we will not.

hamlet. nay, but swear’t.

horatio. in [[faith]], my [[lord]], not i.

marcellus. nor i, my [[lord]], in [[faith]].

hamlet. upon my [[sword]].

marcellus. we have sworn, my [[lord]], already.

hamlet. indeed, upon my [[sword]], indeed.

ghost. [_cries under the stage._] swear.

hamlet. ha, ha boy, say’st thou so? art [[arts]] thou there, truepenny? come on,
you hear this fellow in the cellarage. [[consent]] to swear.

horatio. propose the oath, my [[lord]].

hamlet. never to speak of this that you have seen. swear by my [[sword]].

ghost. [_beneath._] swear.

hamlet. _hic et ubique?_ then we’ll shift our ground. come hither,
gentlemen, and lay your hands again upon my [[sword]]. never to speak of
this that you have heard. swear by my [[sword]].

ghost. [_beneath._] swear.

hamlet. well said, old mole! canst [[work]] i’ th’earth so fast? a worthy
pioner! once more remove, [[good]] [[friends]].

horatio. o day and night, but this is wondrous [[strange]].

hamlet. and therefore as a stranger give it welcome. there are more
things in [[heaven]] and [[earth]], horatio, than are dreamt of in your
philosophy. but come, here, as before, never, so [[help]] you [[mercy]], how
strange or odd soe’er i bear myself,— as i perchance hereafter shall
think meet to put an antic disposition on— that you, at such times
seeing me, never shall, with arms encumber’d thus, or this head-shake,
or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, as ‘well, we know’, or ‘we
could and if we would’, or ‘if we list to speak’; or ‘there be and if
they might’, or such ambiguous giving out, to note that you [[know]] aught
of me:—this not to do. so grace and [[mercy]] at your most need [[help]] you,
swear.

ghost. [_beneath._] swear.

hamlet. rest, rest, perturbed spirit. so, gentlemen, with all my [[love]] i
do commend me to you; and what so [[poor]] a [[man]] as hamlet is may do
t’express his [[love]] and friending to you, [[god]] willing, shall not lack.
let us go in together, and still your fingers on your lips, i [[pray]]. the
time is out of joint. o cursed spite, that ever i was born to set it
right. nay, come, let’s go together.

 [_exeunt._]



act ii

scene i. a room in polonius’s house.

 enter polonius and reynaldo.

polonius. give him this [[money]] and these notes, reynaldo.

reynaldo. i will, my [[lord]].

polonius. you shall do marvellous wisely, [[good]] reynaldo, before you
visit him, to make inquiry of his behaviour.

reynaldo. my [[lord]], i did intend it.

polonius. [[marry]], well said; very well said. look you, sir, enquire me
first what danskers are in [[paris]]; and how, and who, what means, and
where they keep, what company, at what expense; and finding by this
encompassment and drift of [[question]], that they do [[know]] my [[son]], come you
more nearer than your particular demands will touch it. take you as
’twere some distant [[knowledge]] of him, as thus, ‘i [[know]] his [[father]] and
his [[friends]], and in part him’—do you mark this, reynaldo?

reynaldo. ay, very well, my [[lord]].

polonius. ‘and in part him, but,’ you may say, ‘not well; but if’t be
he i mean, he’s very wild; addicted so and so;’ and there put on him
what forgeries you please; [[marry]], none so rank as may dishonour him;
take heed of that; but, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips as are
companions noted and most known to [[youth]] and [[liberty]].

reynaldo. as gaming, my [[lord]]?

polonius. ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, drabbing.
you may go so far.

reynaldo. my [[lord]], that would dishonour him.

polonius. [[faith]] no, as you may season it in the charge. you must not
put another scandal on him, that he is open to incontinency; that’s not
my meaning: but breathe his faults [[fault]] so quaintly that they may seem the
taints of [[liberty]]; the flash and outbreak of a fiery [[mind]], a savageness
in unreclaimed [[blood]], of general assault.

reynaldo. but my [[good]] lord—

polonius. wherefore should you do this?

reynaldo. ay, my [[lord]], i would [[know]] that.

polonius. [[marry]], sir, here’s my drift, and i [[believe]] it is a fetch of
warrant. you laying these slight sullies on my [[son]], as ’twere a thing a
little soil’d i’ th’ working, mark you, your party in converse, him you
would sound, having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the [[youth]] you
breathe of guilty, be assur’d he closes with you in this consequence;
‘good sir,’ or so; or ‘friend,’ or ‘gentleman’— according to the phrase
or the addition of [[man]] and [[country]].

reynaldo. very [[good]], my [[lord]].

polonius. and then, sir, does he this,— he does—what was i about to
say? by the mass, i was about to say something. where did i leave?

reynaldo. at ‘closes in the consequence.’ at ‘friend or so,’ and
‘gentleman.’

polonius. at ‘closes in the consequence’ ay, marry! he closes with you
thus: ‘i [[know]] the gentleman, i saw him yesterday, or t’other day, or
then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say, there was he
gaming, there o’ertook in’s rouse, there falling out at tennis’: or
perchance, ‘i saw him enter such a house of sale’— _videlicet_, a
brothel, or so forth. see you now; your bait of falsehood takes this
carp of [[truth]]; and thus do we of [[wisdom]] and of reach, with windlasses,
and with assays of bias, by indirections find directions out. so by my
former lecture and [[advice]] shall you my [[son]]. you have me, have you not?

reynaldo. my [[lord]], i have.

polonius. [[god]] b’ wi’ you, fare you well.

reynaldo. [[good]] my [[lord]].

polonius. observe his inclination in yourself.

reynaldo. i shall, my [[lord]].

polonius. and let him ply his [[music]].

reynaldo. well, my [[lord]].

polonius. farewell.

 [_exit reynaldo._]

 enter ophelia.

how now, ophelia, what’s the matter?

ophelia. alas, my [[lord]], i have been so affrighted.

polonius. with what, in the name of [[god]]?

ophelia. my [[lord]], as i was sewing in my chamber, [[lord]] hamlet, with his
doublet all unbrac’d, no hat upon his head, his stockings foul’d,
ungart’red, and down-gyved to his ankle, pale as his shirt, his knees
knocking each other, and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had
been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors, he comes before me.

polonius. mad for thy [[love]]?

ophelia. my [[lord]], i do not [[know]], but truly i do [[fear]] it.

polonius. what said he?

ophelia. he took me by the wrist and held me hard; then goes he to the
length of all his arm; and with his other hand thus o’er his brow, he
falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it. long stay’d he
so, at [[last]],—a little shaking of mine arm, and thrice his head thus
waving up and down, he rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did
seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being. that done, he lets me
go, and with his head over his shoulder turn’d he seem’d to find his
way without his [[eyes]], for out o’ doors he went without their [[help]], and
to the [[last]] bended their [[light]] on me.

polonius. come, go with me. i will go seek the [[king]]. this is the very
ecstasy of [[love]], whose [[violent]] [[property]] fordoes itself, and leads the
will to desperate undertakings, as oft as any passion under [[heaven]] that
does afflict our natures [[nature]]. i am [[sorry]],— what, have you given him any
hard words of late?

ophelia. no, my [[good]] [[lord]]; but as you did command, i did repel his
letters and denied his access to me.

polonius. that hath made him mad. i am [[sorry]] that with [[better]] heed and
judgment i had not quoted him. i fear’d he did but trifle, and meant to
wreck thee. but beshrew my jealousy! it seems it is as proper to our
age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions [[opinion]] as it is [[common]] for the
younger sort to lack discretion. come, go we to the [[king]]. this must be
known, which, being kept close, might move more [[grief]] to hide than hate
to utter [[love]].

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. a room in the castle.

 enter [[king]], queen, rosencrantz, guildenstern and attendants.

king. welcome, dear rosencrantz and guildenstern. moreover that we much
did long to see you, the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty
sending. something have you heard of hamlet’s transformation; so i call
it, since nor th’exterior nor the inward [[man]] resembles that it was.
what it should be, more than his father’s [[death]], that thus hath put him
so much from th’understanding of himself, i cannot [[dream]] of. i entreat
you both that, being of so [[young]] days brought up with him, and since so
neighbour’d to his [[youth]] and [[humour]], that you vouchsafe your rest here
in our court some little [[time]], so by your companies to draw him on to
pleasures and to gather, so much as from [[occasion]] you may glean,
whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that, open’d, lies [[lie]] within
our remedy.

queen. [[good]] gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you, and sure i am, two
men there are not living to whom he more adheres. if it will please you
to show us so much gentry and [[good]] will as to expend your [[time]] with us
awhile, for the supply and [[profit]] of our [[hope]], your visitation shall
receive such thanks as fits a king’s remembrance.

rosencrantz. both your majesties might, by the [[sovereign]] [[power]] you have
of us, put your dread pleasures [[pleasure]] more into command than to entreaty.

guildenstern. we both obey, and here give up ourselves, in the full
bent, to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded.

king. thanks, rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern.

queen. thanks, guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz. and i beseech you
instantly to visit my too much changed [[son]]. go, some of you, and bring
these gentlemen where hamlet is.

guildenstern. heavens [[heaven]] make our presence and our practices pleasant and
helpful to him.

queen. ay, amen.

 [_exeunt rosencrantz, guildenstern and some attendants._]

 enter polonius.

polonius. th’ambassadors from norway, my [[good]] [[lord]], are joyfully
return’d.

king. thou still hast been the [[father]] of [[good]] news.

polonius. have i, my [[lord]]? assure you, my [[good]] liege, i hold my [[duty]],
as i hold my [[soul]], both to my [[god]] and to my gracious [[king]]: and i do
think,—or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure
as it hath us’d to do—that i have found the very cause of hamlet’s
lunacy.

king. o speak of that, that do i long to hear.

polonius. give first admittance to th’ambassadors; my news shall be the
fruit to that [[great]] feast.

king. thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.

 [_exit polonius._]

he tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found the head and source of
all your son’s distemper.

queen. i [[doubt]] it is no other but the main, his father’s [[death]] and our
o’erhasty [[marriage]].

king. well, we shall sift him.

 enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius.

welcome, my [[good]] friends! say, voltemand, what from our [[brother]] norway?

voltemand. most [[fair]] return of greetings and desires [[desire]]. upon our first,
he sent out to suppress his nephew’s levies, which to him appear’d to
be a preparation ’gainst the polack; but [[better]] look’d into, he truly
found it was against your highness; whereat griev’d, that so his
sickness, [[age]], and impotence was falsely borne in hand, sends out
arrests on fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys, receives rebuke from
norway; and in fine, makes vow before his uncle never more to give
th’assay of arms against your majesty. whereon old norway, overcome
with joy, gives him three thousand crowns [[crown]] in annual fee, and his
commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before, against the
polack: with an entreaty, herein further shown, [_gives a paper._] that
it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this
enterprise, on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set
down.

king. it likes us well; and at our more consider’d [[time]] we’ll [[read]],
answer, and [[think]] upon this [[business]]. meantime we thank you for your
well-took [[labour]]. go to your rest, at night we’ll feast together:. most
welcome [[home]].

 [_exeunt voltemand and cornelius._]

polonius. this [[business]] is well ended. my liege and madam, to
expostulate what majesty should be, what [[duty]] is, why day is day, night
night, and [[time]] is [[time]]. were nothing but to waste night, day and [[time]].
therefore, since brevity is the [[soul]] of wit, and tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes, i will be brief. your [[noble]] [[son]] is mad. mad
call i it; for to define true madness, what is’t but to be nothing else
but mad? but let that go.

queen. more matter, with less art [[arts]].

polonius. madam, i swear i use no art [[arts]] at all. that he is mad, ’tis
true: ’tis true ’tis [[pity]]; and [[pity]] ’tis ’tis true. a foolish figure,
but farewell it, for i will use no art [[arts]]. mad let us grant him then. and
now remains that we find out the cause of this effect, or rather say,
the cause of this defect, for this effect defective comes by cause.
thus it remains, and the remainder thus. perpend, i have a
daughter—have whilst she is mine— who in her [[duty]] and [[obedience]], mark,
hath given me this. now gather, and surmise. [_reads._] _to the
celestial, and my soul’s idol, the most beautified ophelia_— that’s an
ill phrase, a vile phrase; ‘beautified’ is a vile phrase: but you shall
hear. [_reads._] _these; in her excellent [[white]] bosom, these, &c._

queen. came this from hamlet to her?

polonius. [[good]] madam, stay awhile; i will be faithful. [_reads._]
_doubt thou the stars are [[fire]], [[doubt]] that the sun doth move, doubt
truth to be a liar, but never [[doubt]] i [[love]]. o dear ophelia, i am ill at
these numbers. i have not art [[arts]] to reckon my groans. but that i [[love]] thee
best, o most [[best]], [[believe]] it. adieu. thine evermore, most dear [[lady]],
whilst this machine is to him, hamlet._ this in [[obedience]] hath my
daughter show’d me; and more above, hath his solicitings, as they fell
out by [[time]], by means, and place, all given to mine ear.

king. but how hath she receiv’d his [[love]]?

polonius. what do you [[think]] of me?

king. as of a [[man]] faithful and honourable.

polonius. i would fain prove so. but what might you [[think]], when i had
seen this hot [[love]] on the wing, as i perceiv’d it, i must tell you
that, before my [[daughter]] told me, what might you, or my dear majesty
your queen here, [[think]], if i had play’d the desk or table-book, or
given my [[heart]] a winking, mute and dumb, or look’d upon this [[love]] with
idle sight, what might you [[think]]? no, i went round to [[work]], and my
young mistress thus i did bespeak: ‘lord hamlet is a [[prince]], out of thy
star. this must not be.’ and then i precepts gave her, that she should
lock herself from his resort, admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
which done, she took the fruits of my [[advice]], and he, repulsed,—a short
tale to make— fell into a sadness, then into a fast, thence to a watch,
thence into a weakness, thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
into the madness wherein now he raves, and all we wail for.

king. do you [[think]] ’tis this?

queen. it may be, very likely.

polonius. hath there been such a [[time]], i’d fain [[know]] that, that i have
positively said ‘’tis so,’ when it prov’d otherwise?

king. not that i [[know]].

polonius. take this from this, if this be otherwise. [_points to his
head and shoulder._] if circumstances lead me, i will find where truth
is hid, though it were hid indeed within the centre.

king. how may we try it further?

polonius. you [[know]] sometimes he walks four hours together here in the
lobby.

queen. so he does indeed.

polonius. at such a [[time]] i’ll loose my [[daughter]] to him. be you and i
behind an arras then, mark the encounter. if he [[love]] her not, and be
not from his [[reason]] fall’n thereon, let me be no assistant for a [[state]],
but keep a farm and carters.

king. we will try it.

 enter hamlet, reading.

queen. but look where sadly the [[poor]] wretch comes reading.

polonius. away, i do beseech you, both away i’ll board him presently.
o, give me leave.

 [_exeunt [[king]], queen and attendants._]

how does my [[good]] [[lord]] hamlet?

hamlet. well, god-a-mercy.

polonius. do you [[know]] me, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. excellent well. you’re a fishmonger.

polonius. not i, my [[lord]].

hamlet. then i would you were so honest a [[man]].

polonius. honest, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. ay sir, to be honest, as this [[world]] goes, is to be one man
picked out of ten thousand.

polonius. that’s very true, my [[lord]].

hamlet. for if the sun breed maggots in a [[dead]] dog, being a good
kissing carrion,— have you a [[daughter]]?

polonius. i have, my [[lord]].

hamlet. let her not walk i’ th’ sun. conception is a blessing, but not
as your [[daughter]] may conceive. friend, look to’t.

polonius. how say you by that? [_aside._] still harping on my [[daughter]].
yet he knew me not at first; he said i was a fishmonger. he is far
gone, far gone. and truly in my [[youth]] i [[suffered]] much extremity for
love; very near this. i’ll speak to him again.—what do you [[read]], my
lord?

hamlet. words, words, words.

polonius. what is the matter, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. between who?

polonius. i mean the matter that you [[read]], my [[lord]].

hamlet. slanders, sir. for the satirical [[slave]] says here that old men
have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their [[eyes]] purging
thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most [[weak]] hams. all which, sir, though i most
powerfully and potently [[believe]], yet i hold it not honesty to have it
thus set down. for you yourself, sir, should be old as i am, if like a
crab you could go backward.

polonius. [_aside._] though this be madness, yet there is a method
in’t.— will you walk out of the air, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. into my grave?

polonius. indeed, that is out o’ the air. [_aside._] how pregnant
sometimes his replies are! a [[happiness]] that often madness hits on,
which [[reason]] and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. i
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him
and my [[daughter]]. my honourable [[lord]], i will most humbly take my leave
of you.

hamlet. you cannot, sir, take from me anything that i will more
willingly part withal, except my [[life]], except my [[life]], except my [[life]].

polonius. fare you well, my [[lord]].

hamlet. these tedious old fools [[fool]].

 enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.

polonius. you go to seek the [[lord]] hamlet; there he is.

rosencrantz. [_to polonius._] [[god]] save you, sir.

 [_exit polonius._]

guildenstern. my honoured lord!

rosencrantz. my most dear lord!

hamlet. my excellent [[good]] friends! how dost thou, guildenstern? ah,
rosencrantz. [[good]] lads, how do ye both?

rosencrantz. as the indifferent [[children]] of the [[earth]].

guildenstern. [[happy]] in that we are not over-happy; on fortune’s cap we
are not the very button.

hamlet. nor the soles of her shoe?

rosencrantz. neither, my [[lord]].

hamlet. then you [[live]] about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?

guildenstern. [[faith]], her privates we.

hamlet. in the secret parts of [[fortune]]? o, most true; she is a
strumpet. what’s the news?

rosencrantz. none, my [[lord]], but that the world’s grown honest.

hamlet. then is doomsday near. but your news is not true. let me
question more in particular. what have you, my [[good]] [[friends]], deserved
at the hands of [[fortune]], that she sends you to prison hither?

guildenstern. prison, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. denmark’s a prison.

rosencrantz. then is the [[world]] one.

hamlet. a goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
dungeons, denmark being one o’ th’ worst.

rosencrantz. we [[think]] not so, my [[lord]].

hamlet. why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either [[good]] or
bad but thinking makes it so. to me it is a prison.

rosencrantz. why, then your [[ambition]] makes it one; ’tis too narrow for
your [[mind]].

hamlet. o [[god]], i could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a
king of infinite space, were it not that i have [[bad]] dreams [[dream]].

guildenstern. which dreams [[dream]], indeed, are [[ambition]]; for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a [[dream]].

hamlet. a [[dream]] itself is but a shadow.

rosencrantz. truly, and i hold [[ambition]] of so airy and [[light]] a quality
that it is but a shadow’s shadow.

hamlet. then are our beggars bodies [[body]], and our monarchs and outstretch’d
heroes the beggars’ shadows. shall we to th’ court? for, by my fay, i
cannot [[reason]].

rosencrantz and guildenstern. we’ll wait upon you.

hamlet. no such matter. i will not sort you with the rest of my
servants; for, to speak to you like an honest [[man]], i am most dreadfully
attended. but, in the beaten way of [[friendship]], what make you at
elsinore?

rosencrantz. to visit you, my [[lord]], no other [[occasion]].

hamlet. beggar that i am, i am even [[poor]] in thanks; but i thank you.
and sure, dear [[friends]], my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. were you
not sent for? is it your own inclining? is it a [[free]] visitation? come,
deal justly with me. come, come; nay, speak.

guildenstern. what should we say, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. why, anything. but to the [[purpose]]. you were sent for; and there
is a [[kind]] of [[confession]] in your looks, which your modesties have not
craft enough to colour. i [[know]] the [[good]] [[king]] and queen have sent for
you.

rosencrantz. to what end, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. that you must [[teach]] me. but let me conjure you, by the rights
of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our [[youth]], by the obligation of
our ever-preserved [[love]], and by what more dear a [[better]] proposer could
charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent
for or no.

rosencrantz. [_to guildenstern._] what say you?

hamlet. [_aside._] nay, then i have an eye of you. if you [[love]] me, hold
not off.

guildenstern. my [[lord]], we were sent for.

hamlet. i will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery, and your secrecy to the [[king]] and queen moult no feather. i
have of late, but wherefore i [[know]] not, lost all my mirth, forgone all
custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition
that this goodly frame the [[earth]], seems to me a sterile promontory;
this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging
firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden [[fire]], why, it
appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of
vapours. what a piece of [[work]] is man! how [[noble]] in [[reason]]? how infinite
in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable? in action
how like an angel? in apprehension, how like a [[god]]? the [[beauty]] of the
world, the paragon of animals. and yet, to me, what is this
quintessence of dust? [[man]] delights not me; no, nor woman neither,
though by your smiling you seem to say so.

rosencrantz. my [[lord]], there was no such stuff in my thoughts [[thought]].

hamlet. why did you laugh then, when i said ‘man delights not me’?

rosencrantz. to [[think]], my [[lord]], if you delight not in [[man]], what lenten
entertainment the players shall receive from you. we coted them on the
way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.

hamlet. he that plays the [[king]] shall be welcome,—his majesty shall have
tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target;
the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous [[man]] shall end his part in
peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a’ th’
sere; and the [[lady]] shall say her [[mind]] freely, or the blank verse shall
halt for’t. what players are they?

rosencrantz. even those you were wont to take such delight in—the
tragedians of the [[city]].

hamlet. how chances [[chance]] it they travel? their residence, both in reputation
and [[profit]], was [[better]] both ways.

rosencrantz. i [[think]] their inhibition comes by the means of the late
innovation.

hamlet. do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the
city? are they so followed?

rosencrantz. no, indeed, they are not.

hamlet. how comes it? do they grow rusty?

rosencrantz. nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is, sir, an ayry of [[children]], little eyases, that cry out on the top of
question, and are most tyrannically clapped for’t. these are now the
fashion, and so berattle the [[common]] stages—so they call them—that many
wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come
thither.

hamlet. what, are they [[children]]? who maintains ’em? how are they
escoted? will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?
will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
players—as it is most like, if their means are no better—their writers
do them [[wrong]] to make them exclaim against their own succession?

rosencrantz. [[faith]], there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation holds it no [[sin]] to tarre them to controversy. there was for a
while, no [[money]] bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the [[question]].

hamlet. is’t possible?

guildenstern. o, there has been much throwing about of brains.

hamlet. do the boys carry it away?

rosencrantz. ay, that they do, my [[lord]]. hercules and his load too.

hamlet. it is not very [[strange]]; for my uncle is [[king]] of denmark, and
those that would make mouths at him while my [[father]] lived, give twenty,
forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.
’sblood, there is something in this more than [[natural]], if philosophy
could find it out.

 [_flourish of trumpets within._]

guildenstern. there are the players.

hamlet. gentlemen, you are welcome to elsinore. your hands, come. the
appurtenance of welcome is [[fashion]] and [[ceremony]]. let me comply with you
in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which i tell you must show
fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. you
are welcome. but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.

guildenstern. in what, my dear [[lord]]?

hamlet. i am but mad north-north-west. when the wind is southerly, i
know a hawk from a handsaw.

 enter polonius.

polonius. well be with you, gentlemen.

hamlet. hark you, guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. that
great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.

rosencrantz. happily he’s the second [[time]] come to them; for they say an
old [[man]] is twice a child.

hamlet. i will [[prophesy]] he comes to tell me of the players. mark
it.—you say [[right]], sir: for a monday morning ’twas so indeed.

polonius. my [[lord]], i have news to tell you.

hamlet. my [[lord]], i have news to tell you. when roscius was an actor in
rome—

polonius. the actors are come hither, my [[lord]].

hamlet. buzz, buzz.

polonius. upon my [[honour]].

hamlet. then came each actor on his ass—

polonius. the [[best]] actors in the [[world]], either for tragedy, comedy,
history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene
individable, or poem unlimited. seneca cannot be too heavy, nor plautus
too [[light]], for the [[law]] of writ and the [[liberty]]. these are the only [[men]].

hamlet. o jephthah, [[judge]] of [[israel]], what a treasure hadst thou!

polonius. what treasure had he, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. why— ’one [[fair]] [[daughter]], and no more, the which he loved
passing well.’

polonius. [_aside._] still on my [[daughter]].

hamlet. am i not i’ th’ [[right]], old jephthah?

polonius. if you call me jephthah, my [[lord]], i have a [[daughter]] that i
love passing well.

hamlet. nay, that follows not.

polonius. what follows then, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. why, as by lot, [[god]] wot, and then, you [[know]], it came to pass,
as most like it was. the first row of the pious chanson will show you
more. for look where my abridgement comes.

 enter four or five players.

you are welcome, masters, welcome all. i am glad to see thee well.
welcome, [[good]] [[friends]]. o, my old friend! thy face is valanc’d since i
saw thee [[last]]. com’st thou to beard me in denmark? what, my [[young]] lady
and mistress! by’r [[lady]], your ladyship is nearer to [[heaven]] than when i
saw you [[last]], by the altitude of a chopine. [[pray]] [[god]] your voice, like a
piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. masters, you
are all welcome. we’ll e’en to’t like french falconers, fly at anything
we see. we’ll have a [[speech]] straight. come, give us a taste of your
quality. come, a passionate [[speech]].

first player. what [[speech]], my [[lord]]?

hamlet. i heard thee speak me a [[speech]] once, but it was never acted, or
if it was, not above once, for the play, i [[remember]], pleased not the
million, ’twas caviare to the general. but it was—as i received it, and
others, whose judgments [[judgment]] in such matters cried in the top of mine—an
excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much
modesty as cunning. i [[remember]] one said there were no sallets in the
lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that
might indite the author of affectation, but called it an honest method,
as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. one
speech in it, i chiefly loved. ’twas aeneas’ tale to dido, and
thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam’s slaughter. if it
live in your memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see: _the
rugged pyrrhus, like th’ hyrcanian beast,—_ it is not so: it begins
with pyrrhus— _the rugged pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, black as his
purpose, did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous
horse, hath now this dread and black [[complexion]] smear’d with heraldry
more dismal. head to foot now is he total gules, horridly trick’d with
blood of fathers [[father]], mothers [[mother]], daughters [[daughter]], sons [[son]], bak’d and impasted with the
parching streets, that lend a tyrannous and a damned [[light]] to their
vile murders. roasted in wrath and [[fire]], and thus o’ersized with
coagulate gore, with [[eyes]] like carbuncles, the hellish pyrrhus old
grandsire priam seeks._ so, proceed you.

polonius. ’fore [[god]], my [[lord]], well spoken, with [[good]] accent and good
discretion.

first player. _anon he finds him, striking too short at greeks [[greek]]. his
antique [[sword]], rebellious to his arm, lies [[lie]] where it falls, repugnant to
command. unequal match’d, pyrrhus at priam drives, in rage strikes
wide; but with the whiff and wind of his fell [[sword]] th’unnerved father
falls. then senseless ilium, seeming to [[feel]] this blow, with flaming
top stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash takes prisoner
pyrrhus’ ear. for lo, his [[sword]], which was declining on the milky head
of reverend priam, seem’d i’ th’air to stick. so, as a painted [[tyrant]],
pyrrhus stood, and like a neutral to his will and matter, did nothing.
but as we often see against some storm, a [[silence]] in the heavens [[heaven]], the
rack stand still, the bold winds speechless, and the orb below as hush
as [[death]], anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region; so after
pyrrhus’ pause, aroused vengeance sets him new a-work, and never did
the cyclops’ hammers fall on mars’s armour, forg’d for proof eterne,
with less remorse than pyrrhus’ bleeding [[sword]] now falls on priam. out,
out, thou strumpet fortune! all you gods, in general synod, take away
her [[power]]; break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, and bowl
the round nave down the hill of [[heaven]], as low as to the fiends._

polonius. this is too long.

hamlet. it shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—prythee say on. he’s
for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. say on; come to hecuba.

first player. _but who, o who, had seen the mobled queen,—_

hamlet. ‘the mobled queen’?

polonius. that’s good! ‘mobled queen’ is [[good]].

first player. _run barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flames with
bisson rheum. a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood, and
for a robe, about her lank and all o’erteemed loins, a blanket, in
th’alarm of [[fear]] caught up— who this had seen, with tongue in venom
steep’d, ’gainst fortune’s [[state]] would [[treason]] have pronounc’d. but if
the gods themselves did see her then, when she saw pyrrhus make
malicious [[sport]] in mincing with his [[sword]] her husband’s limbs, the
instant burst of clamour that she made,— unless things mortal move them
not at all,— would have made milch the burning [[eyes]] of [[heaven]], and
passion in the gods._

polonius. look, where he has not turn’d his colour, and has tears in’s
eyes. [[pray]] you, no more.

hamlet. ’tis well. i’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—good
my [[lord]], will you see the players well bestowed? do you hear, let them
be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the
time. after your [[death]] you were [[better]] have a [[bad]] epitaph than their
ill report while you [[live]].

polonius. my [[lord]], i will use them according to their desert.

hamlet. [[god’s]] bodikin, [[man]], [[better]]. use every [[man]] after his desert, and
who should scape whipping? use them after your own [[honour]] and [[dignity]].
the less they deserve, the more [[merit]] is in your bounty. take them in.

polonius. come, sirs.

hamlet. [[follow]] him, [[friends]]. we’ll hear a play tomorrow.

 [_exeunt polonius with all the players but the first._]

dost thou hear me, old friend? can you play _the murder of gonzago_?

first player. ay, my [[lord]].

hamlet. we’ll ha’t tomorrow night. you could for a need study a speech
of some dozen or sixteen lines, which i would set down and insert in’t,
could you not?

first player. ay, my [[lord]].

hamlet. very well. [[follow]] that [[lord]], and look you mock him not.

 [_exit first player._]

[_to rosencrantz and guildenstern_] my [[good]] [[friends]], i’ll leave you
till night. you are welcome to elsinore.

rosencrantz. [[good]] my [[lord]].

 [_exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern._]

hamlet. ay, so, [[god]] b’ wi’ ye. now i am alone. o what a rogue and
peasant [[slave]] am i! is it not monstrous that this player here, but in a
fiction, in a [[dream]] of passion, could [[force]] his [[soul]] so to his own
conceit that from her working all his visage wan’d; tears in his [[eyes]],
distraction in’s aspect, a broken voice, and his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit? and all for nothing! for hecuba? what’s
hecuba to him, or he to hecuba, that he should weep for her? what would
he do, had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have? he would
drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid
speech; make mad the guilty, and appal the [[free]], confound the ignorant,
and amaze indeed, the very faculties of [[eyes]] and ears. yet i, a dull
and muddy-mettled rascal, peak like john-a-dreams, unpregnant of my
cause, and can say nothing. no, not for a [[king]] upon whose [[property]] and
most dear [[life]] a damn’d defeat was made. am i a [[coward]]? who calls me
villain, breaks my pate across? plucks off my beard and blows it in my
face? tweaks me by the nose, gives me the [[lie]] i’ th’ throat as deep as
to the lungs? who does me this? ha! ’swounds, i should take it: for it
cannot be but i am pigeon-liver’d, and lack gall to make oppression
bitter, or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this
slave’s offal. bloody, bawdy villain! remorseless, [[treacherous]],
lecherous, kindless villain! oh vengeance! why, what an ass am i! this
is most brave, that i, the [[son]] of a dear [[father]] murder’d, prompted to
my [[revenge]] by [[heaven]] and hell, must, like a whore, unpack my [[heart]] with
words and fall a-cursing like a very drab, a scullion! fie upon’t! foh!
about, my brain! i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play,
have by the very cunning of the scene, been struck so to the [[soul]] that
presently they have proclaim’d their malefactions. for murder, though
it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ. i’ll have
these players play something like the murder of my [[father]] before mine
uncle. i’ll observe his looks; i’ll tent him to the quick. if he but
blench, i [[know]] my course. the spirit that i have seen may be the [[devil]],
and the [[devil]] hath [[power]] t’assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps
out of my weakness and my melancholy, as he is very potent with such
spirits, abuses [[abuse]] me to damn me. i’ll have grounds more relative than
this. the play’s the thing wherein i’ll catch the [[conscience]] of the
king.

 [_exit._]



act iii

scene i. a room in the castle.

 enter [[king]], queen, polonius, ophelia, rosencrantz and guildenstern.

king. and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts
on this confusion, grating so harshly all his days of quiet with
turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

rosencrantz. he does confess he feels [[feel]] himself distracted, but from what
cause he will by no means speak.

guildenstern. nor do we find him forward to be sounded, but with a
crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some
confession of his true [[state]].

queen. did he receive you well?

rosencrantz. most like a gentleman.

guildenstern. but with much forcing of his disposition.

rosencrantz. niggard of [[question]], but of our demands, most [[free]] in his
reply.

queen. did you assay him to any pastime?

rosencrantz. madam, it so fell out that [[certain]] players we o’er-raught
on the way. of these we told him, and there did seem in him a [[kind]] of
joy to hear of it. they are about the court, and, as i [[think]], they have
already order this night to play before him.

polonius. ’tis most true; and he beseech’d me to entreat your majesties
to hear and see the matter.

king. with all my [[heart]]; and it doth much content me to hear him so
inclin’d. [[good]] gentlemen, give him a further edge, and drive his
purpose on to these delights.

rosencrantz. we shall, my [[lord]].

 [_exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern._]

king. sweet gertrude, leave us too, for we have closely sent for hamlet
hither, that he, as ’twere by accident, may here affront ophelia. her
father and myself, lawful espials, will so bestow ourselves that,
seeing unseen, we may of their encounter frankly [[judge]], and gather by
him, as he is behav’d, if’t be th’affliction of his [[love]] or no that
thus he suffers for.

queen. i shall obey you. and for your part, ophelia, i do [[wish]] that
your [[good]] beauties [[beauty]] be the [[happy]] cause of hamlet’s wildness: so shall i
hope your virtues [[virtue]] will bring him to his wonted way again, to both your
honours.

ophelia. madam, i [[wish]] it may.

 [_exit queen._]

polonius. ophelia, walk you here.—gracious, so please you, we will
bestow ourselves.—[_to ophelia._] [[read]] on this [[book]], that show of such
an exercise may colour your loneliness.—we are oft to blame in this,
’tis too much prov’d, that with devotion’s visage and pious action we
do sugar o’er the [[devil]] himself.

king. [_aside._] o ’tis too true! how smart a lash that [[speech]] doth
give my conscience! the harlot’s cheek, beautied with plastering art [[arts]],
is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most
painted word. o heavy burden!

polonius. i hear him coming. let’s withdraw, my [[lord]].

 [_exeunt [[king]] and polonius._]

 enter hamlet.

hamlet. to be, or not to be, that is the [[question]]: whether ’tis nobler
in the [[mind]] to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous [[fortune]], or
to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? to
die—to sleep, no more; and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache, and
the thousand [[natural]] shocks that flesh is heir to: ’tis a consummation
devoutly to be wish’d. to [[die]], to sleep. to sleep, perchance to
dream—ay, there’s the rub, for in that sleep of [[death]] what dreams [[dream]] may
come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause.
there’s the [[respect]] that makes calamity of so long [[life]]. for who would
bear the whips and scorns of [[time]], the oppressor’s [[wrong]], the proud
man’s contumely, the pangs of dispriz’d [[love]], the law’s delay, the
insolence of office, and the spurns that patient [[merit]] of the unworthy
takes, when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin? who
would these fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary [[life]], but
that the dread of something after [[death]], the undiscover’d [[country]], from
whose bourn no traveller returns, puzzles the will, and makes us rather
bear those ills we have than fly to others that we [[know]] not of? thus
conscience does make cowards of us all, and thus the native hue of
resolution is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of [[thought]], and
enterprises of [[great]] pith and moment, with this regard their currents
turn awry and lose the name of action. soft you now, the [[fair]] ophelia!
nymph, in thy orisons be all my sins [[sin]] remember’d.

ophelia. [[good]] my [[lord]], how does your [[honour]] for this many a day?

hamlet. i humbly thank you; well, well, well.

ophelia. my [[lord]], i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long
to re-deliver. i [[pray]] you, now receive them.

hamlet. no, not i. i never gave you aught.

ophelia. my honour’d [[lord]], you [[know]] [[right]] well you did, and with them
words of so sweet breath compos’d as made the things more [[rich]]; their
perfume lost, take these again; for to the [[noble]] [[mind]] [[rich]] gifts wax
poor when givers prove unkind. there, my [[lord]].

hamlet. ha, ha! are you honest?

ophelia. my [[lord]]?

hamlet. are you [[fair]]?

ophelia. what means your lordship?

hamlet. that if you be honest and [[fair]], your honesty should admit no
discourse to your [[beauty]].

ophelia. could [[beauty]], my [[lord]], have [[better]] commerce than with honesty?

hamlet. ay, truly; for the [[power]] of [[beauty]] will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the [[force]] of honesty can
translate [[beauty]] into his likeness. this was sometime a paradox, but
now the [[time]] gives it proof. i did [[love]] you once.

ophelia. indeed, my [[lord]], you made me [[believe]] so.

hamlet. you should not have believed me; for [[virtue]] cannot so inoculate
our old stock but we shall relish of it. i loved you not.

ophelia. i was the more deceived.

hamlet. get thee to a nunnery. why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners? i am myself indifferent honest; but yet i could accuse me of
such things that it were [[better]] my [[mother]] had not borne me. i am very
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than i have
thoughts to put them in, [[imagination]] to give them shape, or [[time]] to act
them in. what should such fellows as i do crawling between [[earth]] and
heaven? we are arrant knaves all, [[believe]] none of us. go thy ways to a
nunnery. where’s your [[father]]?

ophelia. at [[home]], my [[lord]].

hamlet. let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
nowhere but in’s own house. farewell.

ophelia. o [[help]] him, you sweet heavens!

hamlet. if thou dost [[marry]], i’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry.
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
calumny. get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. or if thou wilt needs
marry, [[marry]] a [[fool]]; for [[wise]] [[men]] [[know]] well enough what monsters you
make of them. to a nunnery, go; and quickly too. farewell.

ophelia. o heavenly powers [[power]], restore him!

hamlet. i have heard of your paintings too, well enough. [[god]] hath given
you one face, and you make yourselves another. you jig, you amble, and
you lisp, and nickname [[god’s]] creatures, and make your wantonness your
ignorance. go to, i’ll no more on’t, it hath made me mad. i say, we
will have no more marriages [[marriage]]. those that are [[married]] already, all but
one, shall [[live]]; the rest shall keep as they are. to a nunnery, go.

 [_exit._]

ophelia. o, what a [[noble]] [[mind]] is here o’erthrown! the courtier’s,
soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue, [[sword]], th’expectancy and rose of the
fair [[state]], the glass of [[fashion]] and the mould of form, th’observ’d of
all observers, quite, quite down! and i, of ladies [[lady]] most deject and
wretched, that suck’d the honey of his [[music]] vows, now see that noble
and most [[sovereign]] [[reason]], like sweet bells jangled out of tune and
harsh, that unmatch’d form and feature of blown [[youth]] blasted with
ecstasy. o woe is me, t’have seen what i have seen, see what i see.

 enter [[king]] and polonius.

king. [[love]]? his affections do not that way tend, nor what he spake,
though it lack’d form a little, was not like madness. there’s something
in his [[soul]] o’er which his melancholy sits on brood, and i do [[doubt]] the
hatch and the disclose will be some danger, which for to prevent, i
have in quick determination thus set it down: he shall with speed to
england for the demand of our neglected tribute: haply the seas and
countries different, with variable objects, shall expel this something
settled matter in his [[heart]], whereon his brains still beating puts him
thus from [[fashion]] of himself. what [[think]] you on’t?

polonius. it shall do well. but yet do i [[believe]] the origin and
commencement of his [[grief]] sprung from neglected [[love]]. how now, ophelia?
you need not tell us what [[lord]] hamlet said, we heard it all. my [[lord]],
do as you please, but if you hold it fit, after the play, let his queen
mother all alone entreat him to show his [[grief]], let her be round with
him, and i’ll be plac’d, so please you, in the ear of all their
conference. if she find him not, to [[england]] send him; or confine him
where your [[wisdom]] [[best]] shall [[think]].

king. it shall be so. madness in [[great]] ones must not unwatch’d go.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. a hall in the castle.

 enter hamlet and [[certain]] players.

hamlet. speak the [[speech]], i [[pray]] you, as i pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue. but if you mouth it, as many of your players
do, i had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very
torrent, tempest, and, as i may say, whirlwind of passion, you must
acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. o, it
offends me to the [[soul]] to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a
passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,
who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
shows and noise. i would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing
termagant. it out-herods herod. [[pray]] you avoid it.

first player. i warrant your [[honour]].

hamlet. be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
tutor. suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this
special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of [[nature]]; for
anything so overdone is from the [[purpose]] of playing, whose end, both at
the first and now, was and is, to hold as ’twere the mirror up to
nature; to show [[virtue]] her own feature, scorn her own image, and the
very [[age]] and [[body]] of the [[time]] his form and pressure. now, this
overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot
but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in
your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. o, there be players
that i have seen play—and heard others [[praise]], and that highly—not to
speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of christians [[christian]], nor
the gait of [[christian]], pagan, nor [[man]], have so strutted and bellowed
that i have [[thought]] some of nature’s journeymen had made [[men]], and not
made them well, they imitated [[humanity]] so abominably.

first player. i [[hope]] we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir.

hamlet. o reform it altogether. and let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them. for there be of them that will
themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too, though in the meantime some necessary [[question]] of the play be then
to be considered. that’s villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the [[fool]] that uses it. go make you ready.

 [_exeunt players._]

 enter polonius, rosencrantz and guildenstern.

how now, my [[lord]]? will the [[king]] hear this piece of [[work]]?

polonius. and the queen too, and that presently.

hamlet. bid the players make haste.

 [_exit polonius._]

will you two [[help]] to hasten them?

rosencrantz and guildenstern. we will, my [[lord]].

 [_exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern._]

hamlet. what ho, horatio!

 enter horatio.

horatio. here, sweet [[lord]], at your service.

hamlet. horatio, thou art [[arts]] e’en as just a [[man]] as e’er my conversation
cop’d withal.

horatio. o my dear [[lord]].

hamlet. nay, do not [[think]] i flatter; for what advancement may i hope
from thee, that no [[revenue]] hast, but thy [[good]] spirits to feed and
clothe thee? why should the [[poor]] be flatter’d? no, let the candied
tongue lick absurd pomp, and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
where thrift may [[follow]] fawning. dost thou hear? since my dear [[soul]] was
mistress of her [[choice]], and could of [[men]] distinguish, her election hath
seal’d thee for herself. for thou hast been as one, in suffering all,
that suffers nothing, a [[man]] that fortune’s buffets and rewards [[reward]] hast
ta’en with [[equal]] thanks. and bles’d are those whose [[blood]] and judgment
are so well co-mingled that they are not a pipe for fortune’s finger to
sound what stop she please. give me that [[man]] that is not passion’s
slave, and i will wear him in my heart’s core, ay, in my [[heart]] of
heart, as i do thee. something too much of this. there is a play
tonight before the [[king]]. one scene of it comes near the circumstance
which i have told thee, of my father’s [[death]]. i prythee, when thou
see’st that act a-foot, even with the very comment of thy [[soul]] observe
mine uncle. if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one [[speech]],
it is a damned ghost that we have seen; and my imaginations [[imagination]] are as foul
as vulcan’s stithy. give him heedful note; for i mine [[eyes]] will rivet
to his face; and after we will both our judgments [[judgment]] join in censure of
his seeming.

horatio. well, my [[lord]]. if he steal aught the whilst this play is
playing, and scape detecting, i will [[pay]] the theft.

hamlet. they are coming to the play. i must be idle. get you a place.

 danish march. a flourish. enter [[king]], queen, polonius, ophelia,
 rosencrantz, guildenstern and others.

king. how fares our cousin hamlet?

hamlet. excellent, i’ [[faith]]; of the chameleon’s dish: i [[eat]] the air,
promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.

king. i have nothing with this [[answer]], hamlet; these words are not
mine.

hamlet. no, nor mine now. [_to polonius._] my [[lord]], you play’d once i’
th’university, you say?

polonius. that did i, my [[lord]], and was accounted a [[good]] actor.

hamlet. what did you enact?

polonius. i did enact julius caesar. i was kill’d i’ th’ capitol.
brutus killed me.

hamlet. it was a brute part of him to kill so [[capital]] a calf there. be
the players ready?

rosencrantz. ay, my [[lord]]; they stay upon your patience.

queen. come hither, my dear hamlet, sit by me.

hamlet. no, [[good]] [[mother]], here’s metal more attractive.

polonius. [_to the [[king]]._] o ho! do you mark that?

hamlet. [[lady]], shall i [[lie]] in your lap?

 [_lying down at ophelia’s feet._]

ophelia. no, my [[lord]].

hamlet. i mean, my head upon your lap?

ophelia. ay, my [[lord]].

hamlet. do you [[think]] i meant [[country]] matters?

ophelia. i [[think]] nothing, my [[lord]].

hamlet. that’s a [[fair]] [[thought]] to [[lie]] between maids’ legs.

ophelia. what is, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. nothing.

ophelia. you are merry, my [[lord]].

hamlet. who, i?

ophelia. ay, my [[lord]].

hamlet. o [[god]], your only jig-maker! what should a [[man]] do but be merry?
for look you how cheerfully my [[mother]] looks, and my [[father]] died
within’s two hours.

ophelia. nay, ’tis twice two months, my [[lord]].

hamlet. so long? nay then, let the [[devil]] wear black, for i’ll have a
suit of sables. o heavens! [[die]] two months ago, and not forgotten yet?
then there’s [[hope]] a [[great]] man’s memory may outlive his [[life]] half a
year. but by’r [[lady]], he must build churches [[church]] then; or else shall he
suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is ‘for, o,
for o, the hobby-horse is forgot!’

 trumpets sound. the dumb show enters.

_enter a [[king]] and a queen very lovingly; the queen embracing him and he
her. she kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. he takes her
up, and declines his head upon her neck. lays him down upon a bank of
flowers. she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. anon comes in a fellow,
takes off his [[crown]], kisses it, pours poison in the king’s ears, and
exits. the queen returns, finds the [[king]] [[dead]], and makes passionate
action. the poisoner with some three or four mutes, comes in again,
seeming to lament with her. the [[dead]] [[body]] is carried away. the poisoner
woos the queen with gifts. she seems loth and unwilling awhile, but in
the end accepts his [[love]]._

 [_exeunt._]

ophelia. what means this, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. [[marry]], this is miching mallicho; it means mischief.

ophelia. belike this show imports the argument of the play.

 enter prologue.

hamlet. we shall [[know]] by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel;
they’ll tell all.

ophelia. will they tell us what this show meant?

hamlet. ay, or any show that you’ll show him. be not you ashamed to
show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.

ophelia. you are naught, you are naught: i’ll mark the play.

prologue. _for us, and for our tragedy, here stooping to your clemency,
we beg your hearing patiently._

hamlet. is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

ophelia. ’tis brief, my [[lord]].

hamlet. as woman’s [[love]].

 enter a [[king]] and a queen.

player [[king]]. full thirty times [[time]] hath phoebus’ cart gone round neptune’s
salt wash and tellus’ orbed ground, and thirty dozen moons with
borrow’d sheen about the [[world]] have times [[time]] twelve thirties been, since
love our hearts [[heart]], and hymen did our hands unite commutual in most sacred
bands.

player queen. so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count
o’er ere [[love]] be done. but, woe is me, you are so sick of late, so far
from cheer and from your former [[state]], that i distrust you. yet, though
i distrust, discomfort you, my [[lord]], it nothing must: for women’s fear
and [[love]] holds quantity, in neither aught, or in extremity. now what my
love is, proof hath made you [[know]], and as my [[love]] is siz’d, my [[fear]] is
so. where [[love]] is [[great]], the littlest doubts [[doubt]] are [[fear]]; where little
fears grow [[great]], [[great]] [[love]] grows there.

player [[king]]. [[faith]], i must leave thee, [[love]], and shortly too: my
operant powers [[power]] their functions leave to do: and thou shalt [[live]] in this
fair [[world]] behind, honour’d, belov’d, and haply one as [[kind]] for husband
shalt thou—

player queen. o confound the rest. such [[love]] must needs be [[treason]] in
my breast. in second husband let me be accurst! none wed the second but
who kill’d the first.

hamlet. [_aside._] wormwood, wormwood.

player queen. the instances that second [[marriage]] move are base respects
of thrift, but none of [[love]]. a second [[time]] i kill my husband [[dead]], when
second husband kisses me in bed.

player [[king]]. i do [[believe]] you [[think]] what now you speak; but what we do
determine, oft we break. [[purpose]] is but the [[slave]] to memory, of violent
birth, but [[poor]] validity: which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the
tree, but fall unshaken when they mellow be. most necessary ’tis that
we forget to [[pay]] ourselves what to ourselves is debt. what to ourselves
in passion we propose, the passion ending, doth the [[purpose]] lose. the
violence of either [[grief]] or joy their own enactures with themselves
destroy. where joy most revels, [[grief]] doth most lament; [[grief]] joys, joy
grieves, on slender accident. this [[world]] is not for aye; nor ’tis not
strange that even our loves [[love]] should with our fortunes [[fortune]] [[change]], for ’tis a
question left us yet to prove, whether [[love]] lead [[fortune]], or else
fortune [[love]]. the [[great]] [[man]] down, you mark his favourite flies, the
poor advanc’d makes [[friends]] of enemies [[enemy]]; and hitherto doth [[love]] on
fortune tend: for who not needs shall never lack a friend, and who in
want a hollow friend doth try, directly seasons him his [[enemy]]. but
orderly to end where i begun, our wills and fates [[fate]] do so contrary run
that our devices still are overthrown. our thoughts [[thought]] are ours, their
ends none of our own. so [[think]] thou wilt no second husband wed, but die
thy thoughts [[thought]] when thy first [[lord]] is [[dead]].

player queen. nor [[earth]] to me give food, nor [[heaven]] [[light]], [[sport]] and
repose lock from me day and night, to desperation turn my trust and
hope, an anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope, each opposite that
blanks the face of joy, meet what i would have well, and it destroy!
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, if, once a widow, ever i
be [[wife]].

hamlet. [_to ophelia._] if she should break it now.

player [[king]]. ’tis deeply sworn. sweet, leave me here awhile. my spirits
grow dull, and fain i would beguile the tedious day with sleep.
[_sleeps._]

player queen. sleep rock thy brain, and never come mischance between us
twain.

 [_exit._]

hamlet. madam, how like you this play?

queen. the [[lady]] protests too much, methinks.

hamlet. o, but she’ll keep her word.

king. have you heard the argument? is there no offence in’t?

hamlet. no, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ th’
world.

king. what do you call the play?

hamlet. _the mousetrap._ [[marry]], how? tropically. this play is the image
of a murder done in vienna. gonzago is the duke’s name, his wife
baptista: you shall see anon; ’tis a knavish piece of [[work]]: but what o’
that? your majesty, and we that have [[free]] souls [[soul]], it touches us not. let
the gall’d jade wince; our withers are unwrung.

 enter lucianus.

this is one lucianus, nephew to the [[king]].

ophelia. you are a [[good]] chorus, my [[lord]].

hamlet. i could interpret between you and your [[love]], if i could see the
puppets dallying.

ophelia. you are keen, my [[lord]], you are keen.

hamlet. it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.

ophelia. still [[better]], and worse.

hamlet. so you mistake your husbands.—begin, murderer. pox, leave thy
damnable faces, and begin. come, the croaking raven doth bellow for
revenge.

lucianus. thoughts [[thought]] black, hands apt, drugs fit, and [[time]] agreeing,
confederate season, else no creature seeing; thou mixture rank, of
midnight weeds collected, with hecate’s ban thrice blasted, thrice
infected, thy [[natural]] magic and dire [[property]] on wholesome [[life]] usurp
immediately.

 [_pours the poison into the sleeper’s ears._]

hamlet. he poisons him i’ th’garden for’s estate. his name’s gonzago.
the story is extant, and written in very [[choice]] italian. you shall see
anon how the murderer gets the [[love]] of gonzago’s [[wife]].

ophelia. the [[king]] rises.

hamlet. what, frighted with false [[fire]]?

queen. how fares my [[lord]]?

polonius. give o’er the play.

king. give me some [[light]]. away.

all. lights [[light]], lights [[light]], lights [[light]].

 [_exeunt all but hamlet and horatio._]

hamlet. why, let the strucken deer go weep, the hart ungalled play; for
some must watch, while some must sleep, so runs the [[world]] away. would
not this, sir, and a forest of feathers, if the rest of my fortunes
turn turk with me; with two provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me
a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?

horatio. half a share.

hamlet. a whole one, i. for thou dost [[know]], o damon dear, this realm
dismantled was of jove himself, and now reigns here a very,
very—pajock.

horatio. you might have rhymed.

hamlet. o [[good]] horatio, i’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand
pound. didst perceive?

horatio. very well, my [[lord]].

hamlet. upon the talk of the poisoning?

horatio. i did very well note him.

hamlet. ah, ha! come, some [[music]]. come, the recorders. for if the king
like not the comedy, why then, belike he likes it not, perdie. come,
some [[music]].

 enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.

guildenstern. [[good]] my [[lord]], vouchsafe me a word with you.

hamlet. sir, a whole [[history]].

guildenstern. the [[king]], sir—

hamlet. ay, sir, what of him?

guildenstern. is in his retirement, marvellous distempered.

hamlet. with drink, sir?

guildenstern. no, my [[lord]]; rather with choler.

hamlet. your [[wisdom]] should show itself more richer to signify this to
the doctor, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him
into far more choler.

guildenstern. [[good]] my [[lord]], put your discourse into some frame, and
start not so wildly from my affair.

hamlet. i am tame, sir, pronounce.

guildenstern. the queen your [[mother]], in most [[great]] affliction of
spirit, hath sent me to you.

hamlet. you are welcome.

guildenstern. nay, [[good]] my [[lord]], this courtesy is not of the right
breed. if it shall please you to make me a wholesome [[answer]], i will do
your mother’s commandment; if not, your pardon and my return shall be
the end of my [[business]].

hamlet. sir, i cannot.

guildenstern. what, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. make you a wholesome [[answer]]. my wit’s diseased. but, sir, such
answer as i can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say, my
mother. therefore no more, but to the matter. my [[mother]], you say,—

rosencrantz. then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
amazement and admiration.

hamlet. o wonderful [[son]], that can so stonish a mother! but is there no
sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration?

rosencrantz. she desires [[desire]] to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.

hamlet. we shall obey, were she ten times [[time]] our [[mother]]. have you any
further [[trade]] with us?

rosencrantz. my [[lord]], you once did [[love]] me.

hamlet. and so i do still, by these pickers and stealers.

rosencrantz. [[good]] my [[lord]], what is your cause of distemper? you do
surely bar the door upon your own [[liberty]] if you deny your griefs to
your friend.

hamlet. sir, i lack advancement.

rosencrantz. how can that be, when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in denmark?

hamlet. ay, sir, but while the grass grows—the proverb is something
musty.

 re-enter the players with recorders.

o, the recorders. let me see one.—to withdraw with you, why do you go
about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?

guildenstern. o my [[lord]], if my [[duty]] be too bold, my [[love]] is too
unmannerly.

hamlet. i do not well [[understand]] that. will you play upon this pipe?

guildenstern. my [[lord]], i cannot.

hamlet. i [[pray]] you.

guildenstern. [[believe]] me, i cannot.

hamlet. i do beseech you.

guildenstern. i [[know]] no touch of it, my [[lord]].

hamlet. ’tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your finger
and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most
eloquent [[music]]. look you, these are the stops.

guildenstern. but these cannot i command to any utterance of harmony. i
have not the [[skill]].

hamlet. why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! you
would play upon me; you would seem to [[know]] my stops; you would pluck
out the [[heart]] of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass; and there is much [[music]], excellent voice, in
this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. ’sblood, do you think
i am easier to be played on than a pipe? call me what instrument you
will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.

 enter polonius.

god bless you, sir.

polonius. my [[lord]], the queen would speak with you, and presently.

hamlet. do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?

polonius. by the mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.

hamlet. methinks it is like a weasel.

polonius. it is backed like a weasel.

hamlet. or like a whale.

polonius. very like a whale.

hamlet. then will i come to my [[mother]] by and by.—they [[fool]] me to the
top of my bent.—i will come by and by.

polonius. i will say so.

 [_exit._]

hamlet. by and by is easily said. leave me, [[friends]].

 [_exeunt all but hamlet._]

’tis now the very witching [[time]] of night, when churchyards yawn, and
hell itself breathes out contagion to this [[world]]. now could i drink hot
blood, and do such bitter [[business]] as the day would quake to look on.
soft now, to my [[mother]]. o [[heart]], lose not thy [[nature]]; let not ever the
soul of nero enter this firm bosom: let me be cruel, not unnatural. i
will speak daggers to her, but use none; my tongue and [[soul]] in this be
hypocrites. how in my words somever she be shent, to give them seals
never, my [[soul]], [[consent]].

 [_exit._]

scene iii. a room in the castle.

 enter [[king]], rosencrantz and guildenstern.

king. i like him not, nor stands it safe with us to let his madness
range. therefore prepare you, i your commission will forthwith
dispatch, and he to [[england]] shall along with you. the terms of our
estate may not endure hazard so near us as doth hourly grow out of his
lunacies.

guildenstern. we will ourselves provide. most holy and [[religious]] fear
it is to keep those many many bodies [[body]] safe that [[live]] and feed upon your
majesty.

rosencrantz. the [[single]] and peculiar [[life]] is bound with all the
strength and armour of the [[mind]], to keep itself from ’noyance; but much
more that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest the lives [[life]] of many. the
cease of majesty dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw what’s near
it with it. it is a massy wheel fix’d on the summit of the highest
mount, to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortis’d and
adjoin’d; which when it falls, each small annexment, petty consequence,
attends the boist’rous ruin. never alone did the [[king]] sigh, but with a
general groan.

king. arm you, i [[pray]] you, to this speedy [[voyage]]; for we will fetters
put upon this [[fear]], which now goes too free-footed.

rosencrantz and guildenstern. we will haste us.

 [_exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern._]

 enter polonius.

polonius. my [[lord]], he’s going to his mother’s closet. behind the arras
i’ll convey myself to hear the process. i’ll warrant she’ll tax him
home, and as you said, and wisely was it said, ’tis meet that some more
audience than a [[mother]], since [[nature]] makes them partial, should
o’erhear the [[speech]] of vantage. fare you well, my liege, i’ll call upon
you ere you go to bed, and tell you what i [[know]].

king. thanks, dear my [[lord]].

 [_exit polonius._]

o, my offence is rank, it smells to [[heaven]]; it hath the primal eldest
curse upon’t,— a brother’s murder! [[pray]] can i not, though inclination
be as sharp as will: my stronger guilt defeats my [[strong]] intent, and,
like a [[man]] to double [[business]] bound, i stand in pause where i shall
first begin, and both neglect. what if this cursed hand were thicker
than itself with brother’s [[blood]], is there not rain enough in the sweet
heavens to wash it [[white]] as snow? whereto serves [[mercy]] but to confront
the visage of offence? and what’s in prayer but this twofold [[force]], to
be forestalled ere we come to fall, or pardon’d being down? then i’ll
look up. my [[fault]] is [[past]]. but o, what form of prayer can serve my
turn? [[forgive]] me my foul murder! that cannot be; since i am still
possess’d of those effects for which i did the murder,— my [[crown]], mine
own [[ambition]], and my queen. may one be pardon’d and retain th’offence?
in the corrupted currents of this [[world]] offence’s gilded hand may shove
by [[justice]], and oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the [[law]].
but ’tis not so above; there is no shuffling, there the action lies [[lie]] in
his true [[nature]], and we ourselves compell’d even to the teeth and
forehead of our faults [[fault]], to give in evidence. what then? what rests? try
what repentance can. what can it not? yet what can it, when one cannot
repent? o wretched state! o bosom black as death! o limed [[soul]], that
struggling to be [[free]], art [[arts]] more engag’d! [[help]], angels! make assay: bow,
stubborn knees; and [[heart]] with strings of steel, be soft as sinews of
the new-born babe. all may be well.

 [_retires and kneels._]

 enter hamlet.

hamlet. now might i do it pat, now he is praying. and now i’ll do’t.
and so he goes to [[heaven]]; and so am i reveng’d. that would be scann’d:
a villain kills my [[father]], and for that i, his sole [[son]], do this same
villain send to [[heaven]]. o, this is hire and salary, not [[revenge]]. he
took my [[father]] grossly, full of bread, with all his crimes broad blown,
as flush as may; and how his audit stands, who knows [[know]] save [[heaven]]? but
in our circumstance and course of [[thought]], ’tis heavy with him. and am
i then reveng’d, to take him in the purging of his [[soul]], when he is fit
and season’d for his passage? no. up, [[sword]], and [[know]] thou a more
horrid hent: when he is drunk asleep; or in his rage, or in
th’incestuous [[pleasure]] of his bed, at gaming, swearing; or about some
act that has no relish of salvation in’t, then trip him, that his heels
may kick at [[heaven]], and that his [[soul]] may be as damn’d and black as
hell, whereto it goes. my [[mother]] stays. this physic but prolongs thy
sickly days.

 [_exit._]

 the [[king]] rises and advances.

king. my words fly up, my thoughts [[thought]] remain below. words without thoughts
never to [[heaven]] go.

 enter queen and polonius.

polonius. he will come straight. look you lay [[home]] to him, tell him his
pranks have been too broad to bear with, and that your grace hath
screen’d and stood between much heat and him. i’ll [[silence]] me e’en
here. [[pray]] you be round with him.

hamlet. [_within._] [[mother]], [[mother]], [[mother]].

queen. i’ll warrant you, [[fear]] me not. withdraw, i hear him coming.

 [_polonius goes behind the arras._]

 enter hamlet.

hamlet. now, [[mother]], what’s the matter?

queen. hamlet, thou hast thy [[father]] much offended.

hamlet. [[mother]], you have my [[father]] much offended.

queen. come, come, you [[answer]] with an idle tongue.

hamlet. go, go, you [[question]] with a wicked tongue.

queen. why, how now, hamlet?

hamlet. what’s the matter now?

queen. have you forgot me?

hamlet. no, by the rood, not so. you are the queen, your husband’s
brother’s [[wife]], and, would it were not so. you are my [[mother]].

queen. nay, then i’ll set those to you that can speak.

hamlet. come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge. you go not
till i set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you.

queen. what wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me? [[help]], [[help]], ho!

polonius. [_behind._] what, ho! [[help]], [[help]], help!

hamlet. how now? a rat? [_draws._] [[dead]] for a ducat, dead!

 [_makes a pass through the arras._]

polonius. [_behind._] o, i am slain!

 [_falls and dies._]

queen. o me, what hast thou done?

hamlet. nay, i [[know]] not. is it the [[king]]?

 [_draws forth polonius._]

queen. o what a rash and bloody deed is this!

hamlet. a bloody deed. almost as [[bad]], [[good]] [[mother]], as kill a [[king]] and
marry with his [[brother]].

queen. as kill a [[king]]?

hamlet. ay, [[lady]], ’twas my word.— [_to polonius._] thou wretched, rash,
intruding [[fool]], farewell! i took thee for thy [[better]]. take thy [[fortune]],
thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.— leave wringing of your
hands. [[peace]], sit you down, and let me wring your [[heart]], for so i
shall, if it be made of penetrable stuff; if damned custom have not
braz’d it so, that it is proof and bulwark against sense.

queen. what have i done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue in noise so
rude against me?

hamlet. such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty, calls
virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose from the [[fair]] forehead of an
innocent [[love]], and sets a blister there. makes [[marriage]] vows as false
as dicers’ oaths. o such a deed as from the [[body]] of contraction plucks
the very [[soul]], and sweet [[religion]] makes a rhapsody of words. heaven’s
face doth glow, yea this solidity and compound mass, with tristful
visage, as against the doom, is thought-sick at the act.

queen. ay me, what act, that roars so loud, and thunders in the index?

hamlet. look here upon this picture, and on this, the counterfeit
presentment of two brothers [[brother]]. see what a grace was seated on this brow,
hyperion’s curls, the front of jove himself, an eye like [[mars]], to
threaten and command, a station like the herald mercury new lighted on
a heaven-kissing hill: a combination and a form indeed, where every god
did seem to set his seal, to give the [[world]] assurance of a [[man]]. this
was your husband. look you now what follows. here is your husband, like
a mildew’d ear blasting his wholesome [[brother]]. have you [[eyes]]? could you
on this [[fair]] mountain leave to feed, and batten on this moor? ha! have
you [[eyes]]? you cannot call it [[love]]; for at your [[age]] the hey-day in the
blood is tame, it’s humble, and waits upon the [[judgment]]: and what
judgment would step from this to this? sense sure you have, else could
you not have motion; but sure that sense is apoplex’d, for madness
would not err nor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d but it
reserv’d some quantity of [[choice]] to serve in such a difference. what
devil was’t that thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind? [[eyes]] without
feeling, feeling without sight, ears without hands or [[eyes]], smelling
sans all, or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope. o
shame! where is thy blush? rebellious hell, if thou canst mutine in a
matron’s bones, to flaming [[youth]] let [[virtue]] be as wax, and melt in her
own [[fire]]. proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the
charge, since frost itself as actively doth burn, and [[reason]] panders
will.

queen. o hamlet, speak no more. thou turn’st mine [[eyes]] into my very
soul, and there i see such black and grained spots as will not leave
their tinct.

hamlet. nay, but to [[live]] in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, stew’d
in [[corruption]], honeying and making [[love]] over the nasty sty.

queen. o speak to me no more; these words like daggers enter in mine
ears; no more, sweet hamlet.

hamlet. a murderer and a villain; a [[slave]] that is not twentieth part
the tithe of your precedent [[lord]]. a [[vice]] of kings [[king]], a cutpurse of the
empire and the [[rule]], that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and
put it in his pocket!

queen. no more.

hamlet. a [[king]] of shreds and patches!—

 enter ghost.

save me and hover o’er me with your wings, you heavenly guards! what
would your gracious figure?

queen. alas, he’s mad.

hamlet. do you not come your tardy [[son]] to chide, that, laps’d in time
and passion, lets go by the important acting of your dread command? o
say!

ghost. do not forget. this visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted
purpose. but look, amazement on thy [[mother]] sits. o step between her and
her fighting [[soul]]. conceit in weakest bodies [[body]] strongest works [[work]]. speak to
her, hamlet.

hamlet. how is it with you, [[lady]]?

queen. alas, how is’t with you, that you do bend your eye on vacancy,
and with the incorporal air do hold discourse? forth at your [[eyes]] your
spirits wildly peep, and, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, your
bedded hairs, like [[life]] in excrements, start up and stand an end. o
gentle [[son]], upon the heat and flame of thy distemper sprinkle cool
patience. whereon do you look?

hamlet. on him, on him! look you how pale he glares, his form and cause
conjoin’d, preaching to stones, would make them capable.—do not look
upon me, lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects.
then what i have to do will want true colour; tears perchance for
blood.

queen. to whom do you speak this?

hamlet. do you see nothing there?

queen. nothing at all; yet all that is i see.

hamlet. nor did you nothing hear?

queen. no, nothing but ourselves.

hamlet. why, look you there! look how it steals away! my [[father]], in his
habit as he liv’d! look where he goes even now out at the portal.

 [_exit ghost._]

queen. this is the very coinage of your brain. this bodiless creation
ecstasy is very cunning in.

hamlet. ecstasy! my pulse as yours doth temperately keep [[time]], and
makes as healthful [[music]]. it is not madness that i have utter’d. bring
me to the test, and i the matter will re-word; which madness would
gambol from. [[mother]], for [[love]] of grace, lay not that flattering unction
to your [[soul]] that not your trespass, but my madness speaks. it will but
skin and film the ulcerous place, whilst rank [[corruption]], mining all
within, infects unseen. confess yourself to [[heaven]], repent what’s [[past]],
avoid what is to come; and do not spread the compost on the weeds, to
make them ranker. [[forgive]] me this my [[virtue]]; for in the fatness of
these pursy times [[time]] [[virtue]] itself of [[vice]] must pardon beg, yea, curb and
woo for leave to do him [[good]].

queen. o hamlet, thou hast cleft my [[heart]] in twain.

hamlet. o throw away the worser part of it, and [[live]] the purer with the
other half. [[good]] night. but go not to mine uncle’s bed. assume a
virtue, if you have it not. that monster custom, who all sense doth
eat, of habits [[evil]], is angel yet in this, that to the use of actions
fair and [[good]] he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on.
refrain tonight, and that shall lend a [[kind]] of easiness to the next
abstinence. the next more easy; for use almost can [[change]] the stamp of
nature, and either curb the [[devil]], or throw him out with wondrous
potency. once more, [[good]] night, and when you are desirous to be bles’d,
i’ll blessing beg of you. for this same [[lord]] [_pointing to polonius._]
i do repent; but [[heaven]] hath pleas’d it so, to punish me with this, and
this with me, that i must be their scourge and minister. i will bestow
him, and will [[answer]] well the [[death]] i gave him. so again, [[good]] night. i
must be cruel, only to be [[kind]]: thus [[bad]] begins, and worse remains
behind. one word more, [[good]] [[lady]].

queen. what shall i do?

hamlet. not this, by no means, that i bid you do: let the bloat king
tempt you again to bed, pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,
and let him, for a pair of reechy kisses, or paddling in your neck with
his damn’d fingers, make you to ravel all this matter out, that i
essentially am not in madness, but mad in craft. ’twere [[good]] you let
him [[know]], for who that’s but a queen, [[fair]], sober, [[wise]], would from a
paddock, from a bat, a gib, such dear concernings hide? who would do
so? no, in despite of sense and secrecy, unpeg the basket on the
house’s top, let the birds fly, and like the famous ape, to try
conclusions, in the basket creep and break your own neck down.

queen. be thou assur’d, if words be made of breath, and breath of [[life]],
i have no [[life]] to breathe what thou hast said to me.

hamlet. i must to [[england]], you [[know]] that?

queen. alack, i had forgot. ’tis so concluded on.

hamlet. there’s letters seal’d: and my two schoolfellows, whom i will
trust as i will adders fang’d,— they bear the mandate, they must sweep
my way and marshal me to knavery. let it [[work]]; for ’tis the [[sport]] to
have the enginer hoist with his own petard, and ’t shall go hard but i
will delve one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon. o,
’tis most sweet, when in one line two crafts directly meet. this man
shall set me packing. i’ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
mother, [[good]] night. indeed, this counsellor is now most still, most
secret, and most grave, who was in [[life]] a foolish peating knave. come,
sir, to draw toward an end with you. [[good]] night, [[mother]].

 [_exit hamlet dragging out polonius._]



act iv

scene i. a room in the castle.

 enter [[king]], queen, rosencrantz and guildenstern.

king. there’s matter in these sighs. these profound heaves you must
translate. ’tis fit we [[understand]] them. where is your [[son]]?

queen. bestow this place on us a little while.

 [_to rosencrantz and guildenstern, who go out._]

ah, my [[good]] [[lord]], what have i seen tonight!

king. what, gertrude? how does hamlet?

queen. mad as the sea and wind, when both contend which is the
mightier. in his lawless fit behind the arras hearing something stir,
whips out his rapier, cries ‘a rat, a rat!’ and in this brainish
apprehension kills the unseen [[good]] old [[man]].

king. o heavy deed! it had been so with us, had we been there. his
liberty is full of threats to all; to you yourself, to us, to everyone.
alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer’d? it will be laid to us,
whose providence should have kept short, restrain’d, and out of haunt
this mad [[young]] [[man]]. but so much was our [[love]] we would not understand
what was most fit, but like the owner of a foul disease, to keep it
from divulging, let it feed even on the pith of [[life]]. where is he gone?

queen. to draw apart the [[body]] he hath kill’d, o’er whom his very
madness, like some ore among a mineral of metals base, shows itself
pure. he weeps for what is done.

king. o gertrude, come away! the sun no sooner shall the mountains
touch but we will ship him hence, and this vile deed we must with all
our majesty and [[skill]] both countenance and excuse.—ho, guildenstern!

 re-enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.

friends both, go join you with some further aid: hamlet in madness hath
polonius slain, and from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him. go
seek him out, speak [[fair]], and bring the [[body]] into the chapel. i pray
you haste in this.

 [_exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern._]

come, gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest [[friends]], and let them know
both what we mean to do and what’s untimely done, so haply slander,
whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter, as level as the cannon to his
blank, transports his poison’d shot, may miss our name, and hit the
woundless air. o, come away! my [[soul]] is full of discord and dismay.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. another room in the castle.

 enter hamlet.

hamlet. safely stowed.

rosencrantz and guildenstern. [_within._] hamlet! [[lord]] hamlet!

hamlet. what noise? who calls on hamlet? o, here they come.

 enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.

rosencrantz. what have you done, my [[lord]], with the [[dead]] [[body]]?

hamlet. compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.

rosencrantz. tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence, and bear
it to the chapel.

hamlet. do not [[believe]] it.

rosencrantz. [[believe]] what?

hamlet. that i can keep your counsel, and not mine own. besides, to be
demanded of a sponge—what replication should be made by the [[son]] of a
king?

rosencrantz. take you me for a sponge, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. ay, sir; that soaks up the king’s countenance, his rewards [[reward]], his
authorities. but such officers do the [[king]] [[best]] service in the end: he
keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be
last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but
squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.

rosencrantz. i [[understand]] you not, my [[lord]].

hamlet. i am glad of it. a knavish [[speech]] sleeps in a foolish ear.

rosencrantz. my [[lord]], you must tell us where the [[body]] is and go with us
to the [[king]].

hamlet. the [[body]] is with the [[king]], but the [[king]] is not with the [[body]].
the [[king]] is a thing—

guildenstern. a thing, my lord!

hamlet. of nothing. bring me to him. hide fox, and all after.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. another room in the castle.

 enter [[king]], attended.

king. i have sent to seek him and to find the [[body]]. how dangerous is it
that this [[man]] goes loose! yet must not we put the [[strong]] [[law]] on him:
he’s lov’d of the distracted multitude, who like not in their [[judgment]],
but their [[eyes]]; and where ’tis so, th’offender’s scourge is weigh’d,
but never the offence. to bear all smooth and even, this sudden sending
him away must seem deliberate pause. diseases desperate grown by
desperate appliance are reliev’d, or not at all.

 enter rosencrantz.

how now? what hath befall’n?

rosencrantz. where the [[dead]] [[body]] is bestow’d, my [[lord]], we cannot get
from him.

king. but where is he?

rosencrantz. without, my [[lord]], guarded, to [[know]] your [[pleasure]].

king. bring him before us.

rosencrantz. ho, guildenstern! bring in my [[lord]].

 enter hamlet and guildenstern.

king. now, hamlet, where’s polonius?

hamlet. at supper.

king. at supper? where?

hamlet. not where he eats, but where he is eaten. a [[certain]] convocation
of [[politic]] worms are e’en at him. your worm is your only [[emperor]] for
diet. we fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
maggots. your fat [[king]] and your lean beggar is but variable
service,—two dishes, but to one table. that’s the end.

king. alas, alas!

hamlet. a [[man]] may fish with the worm that hath [[eat]] of a [[king]], and eat
of the fish that hath fed of that worm.

king. what dost thou mean by this?

hamlet. nothing but to show you how a [[king]] may go a [[progress]] through
the guts of a beggar.

king. where is polonius?

hamlet. in [[heaven]]. send thither to see. if your messenger find him not
there, seek him i’ th’other place yourself. but indeed, if you find him
not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into
the lobby.

king. [_to some attendants._] go seek him there.

hamlet. he will stay till you come.

 [_exeunt attendants._]

king. hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,— which we do
tender, as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast done,—must send
thee hence with fiery quickness. therefore prepare thyself; the bark is
ready, and the wind at [[help]], th’associates tend, and everything is bent
for [[england]].

hamlet. for [[england]]?

king. ay, hamlet.

hamlet. [[good]].

king. so is it, if thou knew’st our purposes [[purpose]].

hamlet. i see a cherub that sees them. but, come; for england!
farewell, dear [[mother]].

king. thy loving [[father]], hamlet.

hamlet. my [[mother]]. [[father]] and [[mother]] is [[man]] and [[wife]]; [[man]] and [[wife]] is
one flesh; and so, my [[mother]]. come, for [[england]].

 [_exit._]

king. [[follow]] him at foot. tempt him with speed aboard; delay it not;
i’ll have him hence tonight. away, for everything is seal’d and done
that else leans on th’affair. [[pray]] you make haste.

 [_exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern._]

and [[england]], if my [[love]] thou hold’st at aught,— as my [[great]] power
thereof may give thee sense, since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
after the danish [[sword]], and thy [[free]] awe pays [[pay]] homage to us,—thou mayst
not coldly set our [[sovereign]] process, which imports at full, by letters
conjuring to that effect, the [[present]] [[death]] of hamlet. do it, [[england]];
for like the hectic in my [[blood]] he rages, and thou must cure me. till i
know ’tis done, howe’er my haps, my joys were ne’er begun.

 [_exit._]

scene iv. a plain in denmark.

 enter fortinbras and forces [[force]] marching.

fortinbras. go, captain, from me greet the danish [[king]]. tell him that
by his license, fortinbras craves the conveyance of a promis’d march
over his [[kingdom]]. you [[know]] the rendezvous. if that his majesty would
aught with us, we shall express our [[duty]] in his eye; and let him know
so.

captain. i will do’t, my [[lord]].

fortinbras. go softly on.

 [_exeunt all but the captain._]

 enter hamlet, rosencrantz, guildenstern &c.

hamlet. [[good]] sir, whose powers [[power]] are these?

captain. they are of norway, sir.

hamlet. how purpos’d, sir, i [[pray]] you?

captain. against some part of poland.

hamlet. who commands them, sir?

captain. the nephew to old norway, fortinbras.

hamlet. goes it against the main of poland, sir, or for some frontier?

captain. truly to speak, and with no addition, we go to gain a little
patch of ground that hath in it no [[profit]] but the name. to [[pay]] five
ducats, five, i would not farm it; nor will it yield to norway or the
pole a ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

hamlet. why, then the polack never will defend it.

captain. yes, it is already garrison’d.

hamlet. two thousand souls [[soul]] and twenty thousand ducats will not debate
the [[question]] of this straw! this is th’imposthume of much [[wealth]] and
peace, that inward breaks, and shows no cause without why the [[man]] dies.
i humbly thank you, sir.

captain. [[god]] b’ wi’ you, sir.

 [_exit._]

rosencrantz. will’t please you go, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. i’ll be with you straight. go a little before.

 [_exeunt all but hamlet._]

how all occasions [[occasion]] do inform against me, and spur my dull [[revenge]]. what
is a [[man]] if his [[chief]] [[good]] and market of his [[time]] be but to sleep and
feed? a beast, no more. sure he that made us with such large discourse,
looking before and after, gave us not that capability and godlike
reason to fust in us unus’d. now whether it be bestial oblivion, or
some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on th’event,— a thought
which, quarter’d, hath but one part [[wisdom]] and ever three parts
coward,—i do not [[know]] why yet i [[live]] to say this thing’s to do, sith i
have cause, and will, and [[strength]], and means to do’t. examples [[example]] gross
as [[earth]] exhort me, witness this [[army]] of such mass and charge, [[led]] by a
delicate and tender [[prince]], whose spirit, with [[divine]] [[ambition]] puff’d,
makes mouths at the invisible event, exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that [[fortune]], [[death]], and danger dare, even for an eggshell.
rightly to be [[great]] is not to stir without [[great]] argument, but greatly
to find quarrel in a straw when honour’s at the stake. how stand i
then, that have a [[father]] kill’d, a [[mother]] stain’d, excitements of my
reason and my [[blood]], and let all sleep, while to my shame i see the
imminent [[death]] of twenty thousand [[men]] that, for a fantasy and trick of
fame, go to their graves like beds, [[fight]] for a plot whereon the
numbers cannot try the cause, which is not tomb enough and continent to
hide the slain? o, from this [[time]] forth, my thoughts [[thought]] be bloody or be
nothing worth.

 [_exit._]

scene v. elsinore. a room in the castle.

 enter queen, horatio and a gentleman.

queen. i will not speak with her.

gentleman. she is importunate, indeed distract. her mood will needs be
pitied.

queen. what would she have?

gentleman. she speaks much of her [[father]]; says she hears there’s tricks
i’ th’ [[world]], and hems, and beats her [[heart]], spurns enviously at
straws, speaks things in [[doubt]], that carry but half sense. her speech
is nothing, yet the unshaped use of it doth move the hearers to
collection; they aim at it, and botch the words up fit to their own
thoughts, which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
indeed would make one [[think]] there might be [[thought]], though nothing
sure, yet much unhappily. ’twere [[good]] she were spoken with, for she may
strew dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds [[mind]].

queen. let her come in.

 [_exit gentleman._]

to my sick [[soul]], as sin’s true [[nature]] is, each toy seems prologue to
some [[great]] amiss. so full of artless [[jealousy]] is guilt, it spills
itself in fearing to be spilt.

 enter ophelia.

ophelia. where is the beauteous majesty of denmark?

queen. how now, ophelia?

ophelia. [_sings._] how should i your true [[love]] [[know]] from another one?
by his cockle bat and staff and his sandal shoon.

queen. alas, sweet [[lady]], what imports this [[song]]?

ophelia. say you? nay, [[pray]] you mark. [_sings._] he is [[dead]] and gone,
lady, he is [[dead]] and gone, at his head a grass green turf, at his heels
a stone.

queen. nay, but ophelia—

ophelia. [[pray]] you mark. [_sings._] [[white]] his shroud as the mountain
snow.

 enter [[king]].

queen. alas, look here, my lord!

ophelia. [_sings._] larded all with sweet flowers; which bewept to the
grave did go with true-love showers.

king. how do you, pretty [[lady]]?

ophelia. well, [[god]] dild you! they say the owl was a baker’s [[daughter]].
lord, we [[know]] what we are, but [[know]] not what we may be. [[god]] be at your
table!

king. conceit upon her [[father]].

ophelia. [[pray]] you, let’s have no words of this; but when they ask you
what it means, say you this: [_sings._] tomorrow is saint valentine’s
day, all in the morning betime, and i a maid at your window, to be your
valentine.

   then up he rose and donn’d his clothes, and dupp’d the chamber door,
   let in the maid, that out a maid never departed more.

king. pretty ophelia!

ophelia. indeed la, without an oath, i’ll make an end on’t. [_sings._]
by gis and by saint charity, alack, and fie for shame! [[young]] [[men]] will
do’t if they come to’t; by cock, they are to blame.

   quoth she, before you tumbled me, you promis’d me to wed. so would i
   ha’ done, by yonder sun, an thou hadst not come to my bed.

king. how long hath she been thus?

ophelia. i [[hope]] all will be well. we must be patient. but i cannot
choose but weep, to [[think]] they would lay him i’ th’ cold ground. my
brother shall [[know]] of it. and so i thank you for your [[good]] counsel.
come, my coach! [[good]] night, ladies [[lady]]; [[good]] night, sweet ladies [[lady]]; good
night, [[good]] night.

 [_exit._]

king. [[follow]] her close; give her [[good]] watch, i [[pray]] you.

 [_exit horatio._]

o, this is the poison of deep [[grief]]; it springs all from her father’s
death. o gertrude, gertrude, when sorrows [[sorrow]] come, they come not single
spies, but in battalions. first, her [[father]] slain; next, your [[son]] gone;
and he most [[violent]] author of his own just remove; the [[people]] muddied,
thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts [[thought]] and whispers for good
polonius’ [[death]]; and we have done but greenly in hugger-mugger to inter
him. [[poor]] ophelia divided from herself and her [[fair]] [[judgment]], without
the which we are pictures or mere beasts. [[last]], and as much containing
as all these, her [[brother]] is in secret come from [[france]], feeds on his
wonder, keeps himself in clouds, and wants not buzzers to infect his
ear with pestilent speeches [[speech]] of his father’s [[death]], wherein necessity,
of matter beggar’d, will nothing stick our [[person]] to arraign in ear and
ear. o my dear gertrude, this, like to a murdering piece, in many
places gives me superfluous [[death]].

 [_a noise within._]

queen. alack, what noise is this?

king. where are my switzers? let them guard the door.

 enter a gentleman.

what is the matter?

gentleman. save yourself, my [[lord]]. the ocean, overpeering of his list,
eats not the flats with more impetuous haste than [[young]] laertes, in a
riotous head, o’erbears your offices. the rabble call him [[lord]], and, as
the [[world]] were now but to begin, antiquity forgot, custom not known,
the ratifiers and props of every word, they cry ‘choose we! laertes
shall be king!’ caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
‘laertes shall be [[king]], laertes [[king]].’

queen. how cheerfully on the false trail they cry. o, this is counter,
you false danish dogs.

 [_a noise within._]

king. the doors are broke.

 enter laertes, armed; danes following.

laertes. where is this [[king]]?—sirs, stand you all without.

danes. no, let’s come in.

laertes. i [[pray]] you, give me leave.

danes. we will, we will.

 [_they retire without the door._]

laertes. i thank you. keep the door. o thou vile [[king]], give me my
father.

queen. calmly, [[good]] laertes.

laertes. that drop of [[blood]] that’s calm proclaims me bastard; cries
cuckold to my [[father]], brands the harlot even here between the chaste
unsmirched brow of my true [[mother]].

king. what is the cause, laertes, that thy rebellion looks so
giant-like?— let him go, gertrude. do not [[fear]] our [[person]]. there’s such
divinity doth hedge a [[king]], that [[treason]] can but peep to what it would,
acts little of his will.—tell me, laertes, why thou art [[arts]] thus
incens’d.—let him go, gertrude:— speak, [[man]].

laertes. where is my [[father]]?

king. [[dead]].

queen. but not by him.

king. let him demand his fill.

laertes. how came he [[dead]]? i’ll not be juggled with. to hell,
allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil! [[conscience]] and grace, to the
profoundest pit! i dare damnation. to this point i stand, that both the
worlds, i give to negligence, let come what comes; only i’ll be
reveng’d most throughly for my [[father]].

king. who shall stay you?

laertes. my will, not all the [[world]]. and for my means, i’ll husband
them so well, they shall go far with little.

king. [[good]] laertes, if you [[desire]] to [[know]] the certainty of your dear
father’s [[death]], is’t writ in your [[revenge]] that, sweepstake, you will
draw both friend and foe, winner and loser?

laertes. none but his enemies [[enemy]].

king. will you [[know]] them then?

laertes. to his [[good]] [[friends]] thus wide i’ll ope my arms; and, like the
kind life-rendering pelican, repast them with my [[blood]].

king. why, now you speak like a [[good]] child and a true gentleman. that i
am guiltless of your father’s [[death]], and am most sensibly in [[grief]] for
it, it shall as level to your [[judgment]] ’pear as day does to your eye.

danes. [_within._] let her come in.

laertes. how now! what noise is that?

 re-enter ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.

o heat, dry up my brains. tears seven times [[time]] salt, burn out the sense
and [[virtue]] of mine eye. by [[heaven]], thy madness shall be paid by weight,
till our scale turn the beam. o rose of may! dear maid, [[kind]] sister,
sweet ophelia! o heavens [[heaven]], is’t possible a [[young]] maid’s wits should be
as mortal as an old man’s [[life]]? [[nature]] is fine in [[love]], and where ’tis
fine, it sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it
loves.

ophelia. [_sings._] they bore him barefac’d on the bier, hey no nonny,
nonny, hey nonny and on his grave rain’d many a tear.— fare you well,
my dove!

laertes. hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade [[revenge]], it could not
move thus.

ophelia. you must sing ‘down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.’ o, how
the wheel becomes it! it is the false steward that stole his master’s
daughter.

laertes. this nothing’s more than matter.

ophelia. there’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; [[pray]] [[love]], [[remember]].
and there is pansies, that’s for thoughts [[thought]].

laertes. a document in madness, thoughts [[thought]] and remembrance fitted.

ophelia. there’s fennel for you, and columbines. there’s rue for you;
and here’s some for me. we may call it herb of grace o’ sundays. o you
must wear your rue with a difference. there’s a daisy. i would give you
some violets, but they wither’d all when my [[father]] died. they say he
made a [[good]] end. [_sings._] for bonny sweet robin is all my joy.

laertes. [[thought]] and affliction, passion, hell itself she turns to
favour and to prettiness.

ophelia. [_sings._] and will he not come again? and will he not come
again? no, no, he is [[dead]], go to thy death-bed, he never will come
again.

   his beard was as [[white]] as snow, all flaxen was his poll. he is gone,
   he is gone, and we cast away moan. [[god]] ha’ [[mercy]] on his [[soul]].

and of all [[christian]] souls [[soul]], i [[pray]] [[god]]. [[god]] b’ wi’ ye.

 [_exit._]

laertes. do you see this, o [[god]]?

king. laertes, i must commune with your [[grief]], or you deny me [[right]]. go
but apart, make [[choice]] of whom your wisest [[friends]] you will, and they
shall hear and [[judge]] ’twixt you and me. if by direct or by collateral
hand they find us touch’d, we will our [[kingdom]] give, our [[crown]], our
life, and all that we call ours to you in satisfaction; but if not, be
you content to lend your patience to us, and we shall jointly labour
with your [[soul]] to give it due content.

laertes. let this be so; his means of [[death]], his obscure burial,— no
trophy, [[sword]], nor hatchment o’er his bones, no [[noble]] rite, nor formal
ostentation,— cry to be heard, as ’twere from [[heaven]] to [[earth]], that i
must call’t in [[question]].

king. so you shall. and where th’offence is let the [[great]] axe fall. i
pray you go with me.

 [_exeunt._]

scene vi. another room in the castle.

 enter horatio and a servant.

horatio. what are they that would speak with me?

servant. sailors, sir. they say they have letters for you.

horatio. let them come in.

 [_exit servant._]

i do not [[know]] from what part of the [[world]] i should be greeted, if not
from [[lord]] hamlet.

 enter sailors.

first sailor. [[god]] bless you, sir.

horatio. let him bless thee too.

first sailor. he shall, sir, and’t please him. there’s a letter for
you, sir. it comes from th’ambassador that was bound for [[england]]; if
your name be horatio, as i am let to [[know]] it is.

horatio. [_reads._] ‘horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this,
give these fellows some means to the [[king]]. they have letters for him.
ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment
gave us chase. finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a
compelled valour, and in the grapple i boarded them. on the instant
they got clear of our ship, so i alone became their [[prisoner]]. they have
dealt with me like thieves of [[mercy]]. but they knew what they did; i am
to do a [[good]] turn for them. let the [[king]] have the letters i have sent,
and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly [[death]]. i
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much
too [[light]] for the bore of the matter. these [[good]] fellows will bring
thee where i am. rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course for
england: of them i have much to tell thee. farewell. he that thou
knowest thine, hamlet.’

come, i will give you way for these your letters, and do’t the
speedier, that you may direct me to him from whom you brought them.

 [_exeunt._]

scene vii. another room in the castle.

 enter [[king]] and laertes.

king. now must your [[conscience]] my acquittance seal, and you must put me
in your [[heart]] for friend, sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
that he which hath your [[noble]] [[father]] slain pursu’d my [[life]].

laertes. it well appears. but tell me why you proceeded not against
these feats, so crimeful and so [[capital]] in [[nature]], as by your safety,
wisdom, all things else, you mainly were stirr’d up.

king. o, for two special reasons [[reason]], which may to you, perhaps, seem much
unsinew’d, but yet to me they are [[strong]]. the queen his [[mother]] lives
almost by his looks; and for myself,— my [[virtue]] or my plague, be it
either which,— she’s so conjunctive to my [[life]] and [[soul]], that, as the
star moves not but in his sphere, i could not but by her. the other
motive, why to a [[public]] count i might not go, is the [[great]] [[love]] the
general gender bear him, who, dipping all his faults [[fault]] in their
affection, would like the spring that turneth wood to stone, convert
his gyves to graces; so that my arrows, too slightly timber’d for so
loud a wind, would have reverted to my bow again, and not where i had
aim’d them.

laertes. and so have i a [[noble]] [[father]] lost, a sister driven into
desperate terms, whose worth, if praises [[praise]] may go back again, stood
challenger on mount of all the [[age]] for her perfections. but my revenge
will come.

king. break not your sleeps for that. you must not [[think]] that we are
made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with
danger, and [[think]] it pastime. you shortly shall hear more. i lov’d your
father, and we [[love]] ourself, and that, i [[hope]], will [[teach]] you to
imagine—

 enter a messenger.

how now? what news?

messenger. letters, my [[lord]], from hamlet. this to your majesty; this to
the queen.

king. from hamlet! who brought them?

messenger. sailors, my [[lord]], they say; i saw them not. they were given
me by claudio. he receiv’d them of him that brought them.

king. laertes, you shall hear them. leave us.

 [_exit messenger._]

[_reads._] ‘high and mighty, you shall [[know]] i am set naked on your
kingdom. tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly [[eyes]]. when i
shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions [[occasion]] of my
sudden and more [[strange]] return. hamlet.’

what should this mean? are all the rest come back? or is it some [[abuse]],
and no such thing?

laertes. [[know]] you the hand?

king. ’tis hamlet’s [[character]]. ’naked!’ and in a postscript here he
says ‘alone.’ can you advise me?

laertes. i am lost in it, my [[lord]]. but let him come, it warms the very
sickness in my [[heart]] that i shall [[live]] and tell him to his teeth, ‘thus
diest thou.’

king. if it be so, laertes,— as how should it be so? how otherwise?—
will you be rul’d by me?

laertes. ay, my [[lord]]; so you will not o’errule me to a [[peace]].

king. to thine own [[peace]]. if he be now return’d, as checking at his
voyage, and that he means no more to undertake it, i will [[work]] him to
exploit, now ripe in my device, under the which he shall not choose but
fall; and for his [[death]] no wind shall breathe, but even his mother
shall uncharge the practice and call it accident.

laertes. my [[lord]], i will be rul’d; the rather if you could devise it so
that i might be the organ.

king. it falls [[right]]. you have been talk’d of since your travel much,
and that in hamlet’s hearing, for a quality wherein they say you shine.
your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that
one, and that, in my regard, of the unworthiest siege.

laertes. what part is that, my [[lord]]?

king. a very riband in the cap of [[youth]], yet needful too, for [[youth]] no
less becomes the [[light]] and careless livery that it wears than settled
age his sables and his weeds, importing health and graveness. two
months since here was a gentleman of normandy,— i’ve seen myself, and
serv’d against, the french, and they can well on horseback, but this
gallant had witchcraft in’t. he grew unto his seat, and to such
wondrous doing brought his horse, as had he been incorps’d and
demi-natur’d with the brave beast. so far he topp’d my [[thought]] that i
in forgery of shapes and tricks, come short of what he did.

laertes. a norman was’t?

king. a norman.

laertes. upon my [[life]], lamond.

king. the very same.

laertes. i [[know]] him well. he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the
nation.

king. he made [[confession]] of you, and gave you such a masterly report
for art [[arts]] and exercise in your defence, and for your rapier most
especially, that he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed if one could
match you. the scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion,
guard, nor eye, if you oppos’d them. sir, this report of his did hamlet
so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but [[wish]] and beg your
sudden coming o’er to play with him. now, out of this,—

laertes. what out of this, my [[lord]]?

king. laertes, was your [[father]] dear to you? or are you like the
painting of a [[sorrow]], a face without a [[heart]]?

laertes. why ask you this?

king. not that i [[think]] you did not [[love]] your [[father]], but that i know
love is begun by [[time]], and that i see, in passages of proof, time
qualifies the spark and [[fire]] of it. there lives [[life]] within the very flame
of [[love]] a [[kind]] of wick or snuff that will abate it; and nothing is at a
like goodness still, for goodness, growing to a pleurisy, dies in his
own too much. that we would do, we should do when we would; for this
‘would’ changes [[change]], and hath abatements and delays as many as there are
tongues, are hands, are accidents; and then this ‘should’ is like a
spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing. but to the quick o’ th’ulcer:
hamlet comes back: what would you undertake to show yourself your
father’s [[son]] in deed, more than in words?

laertes. to cut his throat i’ th’ [[church]].

king. no place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; [[revenge]] should have
no bounds. but [[good]] laertes, will you do this, keep close within your
chamber. hamlet return’d shall [[know]] you are come [[home]]: we’ll put on
those shall [[praise]] your excellence, and set a double varnish on the
fame the frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together and wager on
your heads. he, being remiss, most generous, and [[free]] from all
contriving, will not peruse the foils; so that with ease, or with a
little shuffling, you may choose a [[sword]] unbated, and in a pass of
practice, requite him for your [[father]].

laertes. i will do’t. and for that [[purpose]] i’ll anoint my [[sword]]. i
bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that, but dip a knife in
it, where it draws [[blood]] no cataplasm so rare, collected from all
simples that have [[virtue]] under the moon, can save the thing from death
this is but scratch’d withal. i’ll touch my point with this contagion,
that if i gall him slightly, it may be [[death]].

king. let’s further [[think]] of this, weigh what convenience both of time
and means may fit us to our shape. if this should fail, and that our
drift look through our [[bad]] performance. ’twere [[better]] not assay’d.
therefore this project should have a back or second, that might hold if
this did blast in proof. soft, let me see. we’ll make a solemn wager on
your cunnings,— i ha’t! when in your motion you are hot and dry, as
make your bouts more [[violent]] to that end, and that he calls for drink,
i’ll have prepar’d him a chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping, if
he by [[chance]] escape your venom’d stuck, our [[purpose]] may hold there.

 enter queen.

how now, sweet queen?

queen. one woe doth tread upon another’s heel, so fast they [[follow]].
your sister’s drown’d, laertes.

laertes. drown’d! o, where?

queen. there is a willow grows aslant a brook, that shows his hoary
leaves in the glassy stream. there with fantastic garlands did she make
of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples, that liberal
shepherds give a grosser name, but our cold maids do [[dead]] [[men’s]] fingers
call them. there on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds clamb’ring to
hang, an envious sliver broke, when down her weedy trophies and herself
fell in the weeping brook. her clothes spread wide, and mermaid-like,
awhile they bore her up, which [[time]] she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
as one incapable of her own distress, or like a creature native and
indued unto that element. but long it could not be till that her
garments, heavy with their drink, pull’d the [[poor]] wretch from her
melodious lay to muddy [[death]].

laertes. alas, then she is drown’d?

queen. drown’d, drown’d.

laertes. too much of water hast thou, [[poor]] ophelia, and therefore i
forbid my tears. but yet it is our trick; [[nature]] her custom holds, let
shame say what it will. when these are gone, the woman will be out.
adieu, my [[lord]], i have a [[speech]] of [[fire]], that fain would blaze, but
that this folly douts it.

 [_exit._]

king. let’s [[follow]], gertrude; how much i had to do to calm his rage!
now [[fear]] i this will give it start again; therefore let’s [[follow]].

 [_exeunt._]



act v

scene i. a churchyard.

 enter two clowns with spades, &c.

first clown. is she to be buried in [[christian]] burial, when she wilfully
seeks her own salvation?

second clown. i tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave
straight. the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it [[christian]] burial.

first clown. how can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own
defence?

second clown. why, ’tis found so.

first clown. it must be _se offendendo_, it cannot be else. for here
lies the point: if i drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an
act hath three branches. it is to act, to do, and to perform: argal,
she drowned herself wittingly.

second clown. nay, but hear you, goodman delver,—

first clown. give me leave. here lies [[lie]] the water; [[good]]. here stands the
man; [[good]]. if the [[man]] go to this water and drown himself, it is, will
he nill he, he goes,—mark you that. but if the water come to him and
drown him, he drowns not himself. argal, he that is not guilty of his
own [[death]] shortens not his own [[life]].

second clown. but is this [[law]]?

first clown. ay, [[marry]], is’t, crowner’s quest [[law]].

second clown. will you ha’ the [[truth]] on’t? if this had not been a
gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ [[christian]] burial.

first clown. why, there thou say’st. and the more [[pity]] that [[great]] folk
should have countenance in this [[world]] to drown or hang themselves more
than their even [[christian]]. come, my spade. there is no ancient
gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up
adam’s profession.

second clown. was he a gentleman?

first clown. he was the first that ever bore arms.

second clown. why, he had none.

first clown. what, art [[arts]] a heathen? how dost thou [[understand]] the
scripture? the [[scripture]] says adam digg’d. could he dig without arms?
i’ll put another [[question]] to thee. if thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself—

second clown. go to.

first clown. what is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
shipwright, or the carpenter?

second clown. the gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
tenants.

first clown. i like thy wit well in [[good]] [[faith]], the gallows does well.
but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill. now, thou dost
ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the [[church]]; argal, the
gallows may do well to thee. to’t again, come.

second clown. who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
carpenter?

first clown. ay, tell me that, and unyoke.

second clown. [[marry]], now i can tell.

first clown. to’t.

second clown. mass, i cannot tell.

 enter hamlet and horatio, at a distance.

first clown. cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
not mend his pace with beating; and when you are [[asked]] this question
next, say ‘a grave-maker’. the houses he makes [[last]] till doomsday. go,
get thee to yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.

 [_exit second clown._]

[_digs and sings._]

   in [[youth]] when i did [[love]], did [[love]], methought it was very sweet; to
   contract, o, the [[time]] for, a, my behove, o methought there was
   nothing meet.

hamlet. has this fellow no feeling of his [[business]], that he sings at
grave-making?

horatio. custom hath made it in him a [[property]] of easiness.

hamlet. ’tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier
sense.

first clown. [_sings._] but [[age]] with his stealing steps hath claw’d me
in his clutch, and hath shipp’d me into the [[land]], as if i had never
been such.

 [_throws up a skull._]

hamlet. that skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. how the
knave jowls it to th’ ground, as if ’twere cain’s jawbone, that did the
first murder! this might be the pate of a politician which this ass now
o’er-offices, one that would circumvent [[god]], might it not?

horatio. it might, my [[lord]].

hamlet. or of a courtier, which could say ‘good morrow, sweet lord! how
dost thou, [[good]] [[lord]]?’ this might be my [[lord]] such-a-one, that praised
my [[lord]] such-a-one’s horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?

horatio. ay, my [[lord]].

hamlet. why, e’en so: and now my [[lady]] worm’s; chapless, and knocked
about the mazard with a sexton’s spade. here’s fine [[revolution]], an we
had the trick to see’t. did these bones cost no more the breeding but
to play at loggets with ’em? mine ache to [[think]] on’t.

first clown. [_sings._] a pickaxe and a spade, a spade, for and a
shrouding-sheet; o, a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is
meet.

 [_throws up another skull._]

hamlet. there’s another. why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and
his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about
the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of
battery? hum. this fellow might be in’s [[time]] a [[great]] buyer of [[land]],
with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
his recoveries. is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his
recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers
vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the
length and breadth of a pair of indentures? the very conveyances of his
lands will scarcely [[lie]] in this box; and must the inheritor himself
have no more, ha?

horatio. not a jot more, my [[lord]].

hamlet. is not parchment made of sheep-skins?

horatio. ay, my [[lord]], and of calf-skins too.

hamlet. they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. i
will speak to this fellow.—whose grave’s this, sir?

first clown. mine, sir. [_sings._] o, a pit of clay for to be made for
such a guest is meet.

hamlet. i [[think]] it be thine indeed, for thou liest in’t.

first clown. you [[lie]] out on’t, sir, and therefore ’tis not yours. for
my part, i do not [[lie]] in’t, yet it is mine.

hamlet. thou dost [[lie]] in’t, to be in’t and say it is thine. ’tis for
the [[dead]], not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

first clown. ’tis a quick [[lie]], sir; ’t will away again from me to you.

hamlet. what [[man]] dost thou dig it for?

first clown. for no [[man]], sir.

hamlet. what woman then?

first clown. for none neither.

hamlet. who is to be buried in’t?

first clown. one that was a woman, sir; but, rest her [[soul]], she’s [[dead]].

hamlet. how absolute the knave is! we must speak by the card, or
equivocation will undo us. by the [[lord]], horatio, these three years i
have taken note of it, the [[age]] is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—how
long hast thou been a grave-maker?

first clown. of all the days i’ th’ year, i came to’t that day that our
last [[king]] hamlet o’ercame fortinbras.

hamlet. how long is that since?

first clown. cannot you tell that? every [[fool]] can tell that. it was the
very day that [[young]] hamlet was born,—he that is mad, and sent into
england.

hamlet. ay, [[marry]], why was he sent into [[england]]?

first clown. why, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there;
or if he do not, it’s no [[great]] matter there.

hamlet. why?

first clown. ’twill not be seen in him there; there the [[men]] are as mad
as he.

hamlet. how came he mad?

first clown. very strangely, they say.

hamlet. how strangely?

first clown. [[faith]], e’en with losing his wits.

hamlet. upon what ground?

first clown. why, here in denmark. i have been sexton here, [[man]] and
boy, thirty years.

hamlet. how long will a [[man]] [[lie]] i’ th’earth ere he rot?

first clown. [[faith]], if he be not rotten before he [[die]],—as we have many
pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in,—he will last
you some eight year or nine year. a tanner will [[last]] you nine year.

hamlet. why he more than another?

first clown. why, sir, his hide is so tann’d with his [[trade]] that he
will keep out water a [[great]] while. and your water is a sore decayer of
your whoreson [[dead]] [[body]]. here’s a skull now; this skull hath lain in
the [[earth]] three-and-twenty years.

hamlet. whose was it?

first clown. a whoreson, mad fellow’s it was. whose do you [[think]] it
was?

hamlet. nay, i [[know]] not.

first clown. a pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a pour’d a flagon of
rhenish on my head once. this same skull, sir, was yorick’s skull, the
king’s jester.

hamlet. this?

first clown. e’en that.

hamlet. let me see. [_takes the skull._] alas, [[poor]] yorick. i knew him,
horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. he hath
borne me on his back a thousand times [[time]]; and now, how abhorred in my
imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. here hung those lips that i
have kiss’d i [[know]] not how oft. where be your gibes now? your gambols?
your songs [[song]]? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table
on a roar? not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chop-fallen?
now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch
thick, to this favour she must come. make her laugh at that.—prythee,
horatio, tell me one thing.

horatio. what’s that, my [[lord]]?

hamlet. dost thou [[think]] alexander looked o’ this [[fashion]] i’ th’earth?

horatio. e’en so.

hamlet. and smelt so? pah!

 [_throws down the skull._]

horatio. e’en so, my [[lord]].

hamlet. to what base uses we may return, horatio! why may not
imagination trace the [[noble]] dust of alexander till he find it stopping
a bung-hole?

horatio. ’twere to consider too curiously to consider so.

hamlet. no, [[faith]], not a jot. but to [[follow]] him thither with modesty
enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus. alexander died, alexander
was buried, alexander returneth into dust; the dust is [[earth]]; of earth
we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they
not stop a beer-barrel? imperious caesar, [[dead]] and turn’d to clay,
might stop a hole to keep the wind away. o, that that [[earth]] which kept
the [[world]] in awe should patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw. but
soft! but soft! aside! here comes the [[king]].

 enter priests [[priest]], &c, in procession; the corpse of ophelia, laertes and
 mourners following; [[king]], queen, their trains, &c.

the queen, the courtiers. who is that they [[follow]]? and with such maimed
rites? this doth betoken the corse they [[follow]] did with desperate hand
fordo it own [[life]]. ’twas of some estate. couch we awhile and mark.

 [_retiring with horatio._]

laertes. what [[ceremony]] else?

hamlet. that is laertes, a very [[noble]] [[youth]]. mark.

laertes. what [[ceremony]] else?

priest. her obsequies have been as far enlarg’d as we have warranties.
her [[death]] was doubtful; and but that [[great]] command o’ersways the order,
she should in ground unsanctified have lodg’d till the [[last]] trumpet.
for charitable prayers, shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on
her. yet here she is allowed her virgin rites, her maiden strewments,
and the bringing [[home]] of bell and burial.

laertes. must there no more be done?

priest. no more be done. we should profane the service of the [[dead]] to
sing sage requiem and such rest to her as to peace-parted souls [[soul]].

laertes. lay her i’ th’earth, and from her [[fair]] and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring. i tell thee, churlish [[priest]], a minist’ring angel
shall my sister be when thou liest howling.

hamlet. what, the [[fair]] ophelia?

queen. [_scattering flowers._] sweets to the sweet. farewell. i hop’d
thou shouldst have been my hamlet’s [[wife]]; i [[thought]] thy bride-bed to
have deck’d, sweet maid, and not have strew’d thy grave.

laertes. o, treble woe fall ten times [[time]] treble on that cursed head whose
wicked deed thy most ingenious sense depriv’d thee of. hold off the
earth a while, till i have caught her once more in mine arms. [_leaps
into the grave._] now pile your dust upon the quick and [[dead]], till of
this flat a mountain you have made, to o’ertop old pelion or the skyish
head of blue [[olympus]].

hamlet. [_advancing._] what is he whose [[grief]] bears such an emphasis?
whose phrase of [[sorrow]] conjures the wand’ring stars, and makes them
stand like wonder-wounded hearers? this is i, hamlet the dane. [_leaps
into the grave._]

laertes. [_grappling with him._] the [[devil]] take thy soul!

hamlet. thou pray’st not well. i prythee take thy fingers from my
throat; for though i am not splenative and rash, yet have i in me
something dangerous, which let thy wiseness [[fear]]. away thy hand!

king. pluck them asunder.

queen. hamlet! hamlet!

all. gentlemen!

horatio. [[good]] my [[lord]], be quiet.

 [_the attendants part them, and they come out of the grave._]

hamlet. why, i will [[fight]] with him upon this theme until my eyelids
will no longer wag.

queen. o my [[son]], what theme?

hamlet. i lov’d ophelia; forty thousand brothers [[brother]] could not, with all
their quantity of [[love]], make up my sum. what wilt thou do for her?

king. o, he is mad, laertes.

queen. for [[love]] of [[god]] forbear him!

hamlet. ’swounds, show me what thou’lt do: woul’t weep? woul’t [[fight]]?
woul’t fast? woul’t tear thyself? woul’t drink up eisel? [[eat]] a
crocodile? i’ll do’t. dost thou come here to whine? to outface me with
leaping in her grave? be buried quick with her, and so will i. and if
thou prate of mountains, let them throw millions of acres on us, till
our ground, singeing his pate against the burning zone, make ossa like
a wart. nay, an thou’lt mouth, i’ll rant as well as thou.

queen. this is mere madness: and thus awhile the fit will [[work]] on him;
anon, as patient as the female dove, when that her golden couplets are
disclos’d, his [[silence]] will sit drooping.

hamlet. hear you, sir; what is the [[reason]] that you use me thus? i lov’d
you ever. but it is no matter. let hercules himself do what he may, the
cat will mew, and dog will have his day.

 [_exit._]

king. i [[pray]] thee, [[good]] horatio, wait upon him.

 [_exit horatio._]

[_to laertes_] strengthen your patience in our [[last]] night’s [[speech]];
we’ll put the matter to the [[present]] push.— [[good]] gertrude, set some
watch over your [[son]]. this grave shall have a living monument. an hour
of quiet shortly shall we see; till then in patience our proceeding be.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. a hall in the castle.

 enter hamlet and horatio.

hamlet. so much for this, sir. now let me see the other; you do
remember all the circumstance?

horatio. [[remember]] it, my lord!

hamlet. sir, in my [[heart]] there was a [[kind]] of fighting that would not
let me sleep. methought i lay worse than the mutinies in the bilboes.
rashly, and prais’d be rashness for it,—let us [[know]], our indiscretion
sometime serves us well, when our deep plots do pall; and that should
teach us there’s a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we
will.

horatio. that is most [[certain]].

hamlet. up from my cabin, my sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark
grop’d i to find out them; had my [[desire]], finger’d their packet, and in
fine, withdrew to mine own room again, making so bold, my fears
forgetting manners, to unseal their grand commission; where i found,
horatio, oh [[royal]] knavery! an exact command, larded with many several
sorts of reasons [[reason]], importing denmark’s health, and england’s too, with
ho! such bugs and goblins in my [[life]], that on the supervise, no leisure
bated, no, not to stay the grinding of the axe, my head should be
struck off.

horatio. is’t possible?

hamlet. here’s the commission, [[read]] it at more leisure. but wilt thou
hear me how i did proceed?

horatio. i beseech you.

hamlet. being thus benetted round with villanies,— or i could make a
prologue to my brains, they had begun the play,—i sat me down, devis’d
a new commission, wrote it [[fair]]: i once did hold it, as our statists
do, a baseness to write [[fair]], and labour’d much how to forget that
learning; but, sir, now it did me yeoman’s service. wilt thou [[know]] the
effect of what i wrote?

horatio. ay, [[good]] my [[lord]].

hamlet. an earnest conjuration from the [[king]], as [[england]] was his
faithful tributary, as [[love]] between them like the palm might flourish,
as [[peace]] should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma ’tween
their amities, and many such-like ‘as’es of [[great]] charge, that on the
view and [[know]] of these contents, without debatement further, more or
less, he should the bearers put to sudden [[death]], not shriving-time
allow’d.

horatio. how was this seal’d?

hamlet. why, even in that was [[heaven]] ordinant. i had my father’s signet
in my purse, which was the model of that danish seal: folded the writ
up in the form of the other, subscrib’d it: gave’t th’impression;
plac’d it safely, the changeling never known. now, the next day was our
sea-fight, and what to this was sequent thou know’st already.

horatio. so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to’t.

hamlet. why, [[man]], they did make [[love]] to this employment. they are not
near my [[conscience]]; their defeat does by their own insinuation grow.
’tis dangerous when the baser [[nature]] comes between the pass and fell
incensed points of mighty opposites.

horatio. why, what a [[king]] is this!

hamlet. does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,— he that hath
kill’d my [[king]], and whor’d my [[mother]], popp’d in between th’election and
my hopes [[hope]], thrown out his angle for my proper [[life]], and with such
cozenage—is’t not [[perfect]] [[conscience]] to quit him with this arm? and
is’t not to be damn’d to let this canker of our [[nature]] come in further
evil?

horatio. it must be shortly known to him from [[england]] what is the issue
of the [[business]] there.

hamlet. it will be short. the interim is mine; and a man’s life’s no
more than to say ‘one’. but i am very [[sorry]], [[good]] horatio, that to
laertes i forgot myself; for by the image of my cause i see the
portraiture of his. i’ll court his favours. but sure the bravery of his
grief did put me into a tow’ring passion.

horatio. [[peace]], who comes here?

 enter osric.

osric. your lordship is [[right]] welcome back to denmark.

hamlet. i humbly thank you, sir. dost [[know]] this waterfly?

horatio. no, my [[good]] [[lord]].

hamlet. thy [[state]] is the more gracious; for ’tis a [[vice]] to [[know]] him. he
hath much [[land]], and fertile; let a beast be [[lord]] of beasts, and his
crib shall stand at the king’s mess; ’tis a chough; but, as i say,
spacious in the possession of dirt.

osric. sweet [[lord]], if your lordship were at leisure, i should impart a
thing to you from his majesty.

hamlet. i will receive it with all diligence of spirit. put your bonnet
to his [[right]] use; ’tis for the head.

osric. i thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.

hamlet. no, [[believe]] me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.

osric. it is indifferent cold, my [[lord]], indeed.

hamlet. methinks it is very sultry and hot for my [[complexion]].

osric. exceedingly, my [[lord]]; it is very sultry,—as ’twere—i cannot tell
how. but, my [[lord]], his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid
a [[great]] wager on your head. sir, this is the matter,—

hamlet. i beseech you, [[remember]],—

 [_hamlet moves him to put on his hat._]

osric. nay, in [[good]] [[faith]]; for mine ease, in [[good]] [[faith]]. sir, here is
newly come to court laertes; [[believe]] me, an absolute gentleman, full of
most excellent differences, of very soft [[society]] and [[great]] showing.
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of
gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a
gentleman would see.

hamlet. sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though i [[know]],
to divide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory, and
yet but yaw neither, in [[respect]] of his quick sail. but, in the verity
of extolment, i take him to be a [[soul]] of [[great]] article and his infusion
of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his
semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage,
nothing more.

osric. your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

hamlet. the concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
rawer breath?

osric. sir?

horatio. is’t not possible to [[understand]] in another tongue? you will
do’t, sir, really.

hamlet. what imports the nomination of this gentleman?

osric. of laertes?

horatio. his purse is empty already, all’s golden words are spent.

hamlet. of him, sir.

osric. i [[know]] you are not ignorant,—

hamlet. i would you did, sir; yet in [[faith]] if you did, it would not
much approve me. well, sir?

osric. you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is,—

hamlet. i dare not confess that, lest i should compare with him in
excellence; but to [[know]] a [[man]] well were to [[know]] himself.

osric. i mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him,
by them in his meed he’s unfellowed.

hamlet. what’s his weapon?

osric. rapier and dagger.

hamlet. that’s two of his [[weapons]]. but well.

osric. the [[king]], sir, hath wager’d with him six barbary horses, against
the which he has imponed, as i take it, six french rapiers and
poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. three of the
carriages, in [[faith]], are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the
hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.

hamlet. what call you the carriages?

horatio. i knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.

osric. the carriages, sir, are the hangers.

hamlet. the phrase would be more [[german]] to the matter if we could carry
cannon by our sides. i would it might be hangers till then. but on. six
barbary horses against six french swords [[sword]], their assigns, and three
liberal conceited carriages: that’s the french bet against the danish.
why is this all imponed, as you call it?

osric. the [[king]], sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and
him, he shall not exceed you three hits. he hath laid on twelve for
nine. and it would come to immediate [[trial]] if your lordship would
vouchsafe the [[answer]].

hamlet. how if i [[answer]] no?

osric. i mean, my [[lord]], the opposition of your [[person]] in [[trial]].

hamlet. sir, i will walk here in the hall. if it please his majesty, it
is the breathing [[time]] of day with me. let the foils be brought, the
gentleman willing, and the [[king]] hold his [[purpose]], i will [[win]] for him if
i can; if not, i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.

osric. shall i re-deliver you e’en so?

hamlet. to this effect, sir; after what flourish your [[nature]] will.

osric. i commend my [[duty]] to your lordship.

hamlet. yours, yours.

 [_exit osric._]

he does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for’s
turn.

horatio. this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.

hamlet. he did comply with his dug before he suck’d it. thus has
he,—and many more of the same bevy that i [[know]] the drossy [[age]] dotes
on,— only got the tune of the [[time]] and outward habit of encounter; a
kind of yeasty collection, which carries them through and through the
most fanned and winnowed opinions [[opinion]]; and do but blow them to their [[trial]],
the bubbles are out,

 enter a [[lord]].

lord. my [[lord]], his majesty commended him to you by [[young]] osric, who
brings back to him that you attend him in the hall. he sends to [[know]] if
your [[pleasure]] hold to play with laertes or that you will take longer
time.

hamlet. i am constant to my purposes [[purpose]], they [[follow]] the king’s [[pleasure]].
if his fitness speaks, mine is ready. now or whensoever, provided i be
so able as now.

lord. the [[king]] and queen and all are coming down.

hamlet. in [[happy]] [[time]].

lord. the queen desires [[desire]] you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes
before you fall to play.

hamlet. she well instructs me.

 [_exit [[lord]]._]

horatio. you will lose this wager, my [[lord]].

hamlet. i do not [[think]] so. since he went into [[france]], i have been in
continual practice. i shall [[win]] at the odds. but thou wouldst not think
how ill all’s here about my [[heart]]: but it is no matter.

horatio. nay, [[good]] my [[lord]].

hamlet. it is but foolery; but it is such a [[kind]] of gain-giving as
would perhaps trouble a woman.

horatio. if your [[mind]] dislike anything, obey it. i will forestall their
repair hither, and say you are not fit.

hamlet. not a whit, we defy augury. there’s a special providence in the
fall of a sparrow. if it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to
come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. the readiness
is all. since no [[man]] has aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave
betimes?

 enter [[king]], queen, laertes, lords [[lord]], osric and attendants with foils &c.

king. come, hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

 [_the [[king]] puts laertes’s hand into hamlet’s._]

hamlet. give me your pardon, sir. i have done you [[wrong]]; but pardon’t
as you are a gentleman. this presence knows [[know]], and you must needs have
heard, how i am punish’d with sore distraction. what i have done that
might your [[nature]], [[honour]], and exception roughly awake, i here proclaim
was madness. was’t hamlet wrong’d laertes? never hamlet. if hamlet from
himself be ta’en away, and when he’s not himself does [[wrong]] laertes,
then hamlet does it not, hamlet denies it. who does it, then? his
madness. if’t be so, hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d; his
madness is [[poor]] hamlet’s [[enemy]]. sir, in this audience, let my
disclaiming from a purpos’d [[evil]] [[free]] me so far in your most generous
thoughts that i have shot my arrow o’er the house and hurt my [[brother]].

laertes. i am satisfied in [[nature]], whose motive in this case should
stir me most to my [[revenge]]. but in my terms of [[honour]] i stand aloof,
and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known [[honour]] i
have a voice and precedent of [[peace]] to keep my name ungor’d. but till
that [[time]] i do receive your offer’d [[love]] like [[love]], and will not wrong
it.

hamlet. i embrace it freely, and will this brother’s wager frankly
play.— give us the foils; come on.

laertes. come, one for me.

hamlet. i’ll be your foil, laertes; in mine ignorance your [[skill]] shall
like a star i’ th’ darkest night, stick fiery off indeed.

laertes. you mock me, sir.

hamlet. no, by this hand.

king. give them the foils, [[young]] osric. cousin hamlet, you [[know]] the
wager?

hamlet. very well, my [[lord]]. your grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker
side.

king. i do not [[fear]] it. i have seen you both; but since he is better’d,
we have therefore odds.

laertes. this is too heavy. let me see another.

hamlet. this likes me well. these foils have all a length?

 [_they prepare to play._]

osric. ay, my [[good]] [[lord]].

king. set me the stoups of wine upon that table. if hamlet give the
first or second hit, or quit in [[answer]] of the third exchange, let all
the battlements their ordnance [[fire]]; the [[king]] shall drink to hamlet’s
better breath, and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that
which four successive kings [[king]] in denmark’s [[crown]] have worn. give me the
cups; and let the kettle to the trumpet speak, the trumpet to the
cannoneer without, the cannons to the heavens [[heaven]], the heavens [[heaven]] to [[earth]],
‘now the [[king]] drinks to hamlet.’ come, begin. and you, the judges [[judge]], bear
a wary eye.

hamlet. come on, sir.

laertes. come, my [[lord]].

 [_they play._]

hamlet. one.

laertes. no.

hamlet. [[judgment]].

osric. a hit, a very palpable hit.

laertes. well; again.

king. stay, give me drink. hamlet, this pearl is thine; here’s to thy
health.

 [_trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within._]

give him the cup.

hamlet. i’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile.

 [_they play._]

come. another hit; what say you?


laertes. a touch, a touch, i do confess.

king. our [[son]] shall [[win]].

queen. he’s fat, and scant of breath. here, hamlet, take my napkin, rub
thy brows. the queen carouses to thy [[fortune]], hamlet.

hamlet. [[good]] madam.

king. gertrude, do not drink.

queen. i will, my [[lord]]; i [[pray]] you pardon me.

king. [_aside._] it is the poison’d cup; it is too late.

hamlet. i dare not drink yet, madam. by and by.

queen. come, let me wipe thy face.

laertes. my [[lord]], i’ll hit him now.

king. i do not think’t.

laertes. [_aside._] and yet ’tis almost ’gainst my [[conscience]].

hamlet. come for the third, laertes. you do but dally. i [[pray]] you pass
with your [[best]] [[violence]]. i am afeard you make a wanton of me.

laertes. say you so? come on.

 [_they play._]

osric. nothing neither way.

laertes. have at you now.

 [_laertes wounds hamlet; then, in scuffling, they [[change]] rapiers, and
 hamlet wounds laertes._]

king. part them; they are incens’d.

hamlet. nay, come again!

 [_the queen falls._]

osric. look to the queen there, ho!

horatio. they bleed on both sides. how is it, my [[lord]]?

osric. how is’t, laertes?

laertes. why, as a woodcock to my own springe, osric. i am justly
kill’d with mine own treachery.

hamlet. how does the queen?

king. she swoons to see them bleed.

queen. no, no, the drink, the drink! o my dear hamlet! the drink, the
drink! i am poison’d.

 [_dies._]

hamlet. o villany! ho! let the door be lock’d: treachery! seek it out.

 [_laertes falls._]

laertes. it is here, hamlet. hamlet, thou art [[arts]] slain. no medicine in the
world can do thee [[good]]. in thee there is not half an hour of [[life]]; the
treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenom’d. the foul
practice hath turn’d itself on me. lo, here i [[lie]], never to rise again.
thy mother’s poison’d. i can no more. the [[king]], the king’s to blame.

hamlet. the point envenom’d too! then, venom, to thy [[work]].

 [_stabs the [[king]]._]

osric and lords [[lord]]. treason! treason!

king. o yet defend me, [[friends]]. i am but hurt.

hamlet. here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned dane, drink off this
potion. is thy union here? [[follow]] my [[mother]].

 [_king dies._]

laertes. he is justly serv’d. it is a poison temper’d by himself.
exchange forgiveness with me, [[noble]] hamlet. mine and my father’s death
come not upon thee, nor thine on me.

 [_dies._]

hamlet. [[heaven]] make thee [[free]] of it! i [[follow]] thee. i am [[dead]], horatio.
wretched queen, adieu. you that look pale and tremble at this [[chance]],
that are but mutes or audience to this act, had i but [[time]],—as this
fell sergeant, [[death]], is strict in his arrest,—o, i could tell you,—
but let it be. horatio, i am [[dead]], thou liv’st; report me and my cause
aright to the unsatisfied.

horatio. never [[believe]] it. i am more an antique roman than a dane.
here’s yet some liquor left.

hamlet. as th’art a [[man]], give me the cup. let go; by [[heaven]], i’ll
have’t. o [[good]] horatio, what a wounded name, things standing thus
unknown, shall [[live]] behind me. if thou didst ever hold me in thy [[heart]],
absent thee from felicity awhile, and in this harsh [[world]] draw thy
breath in [[pain]], to tell my story.

 [_march afar off, and shot within._]

what warlike noise is this?

osric. [[young]] fortinbras, with [[conquest]] come from poland, to the
ambassadors of [[england]] gives this warlike volley.

hamlet. o, i [[die]], horatio. the potent poison quite o’er-crows my
spirit: i cannot [[live]] to hear the news from [[england]], but i do prophesy
th’election lights [[light]] on fortinbras. he has my dying voice. so tell him,
with the occurrents more and less, which have solicited. the rest is
silence.

 [_dies._]

horatio. now cracks a [[noble]] [[heart]]. [[good]] night, sweet [[prince]], and
flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. why does the drum come hither?

 [_march within._]

 enter fortinbras, the english ambassadors and others.

fortinbras. where is this sight?

horatio. what is it you would see? if aught of woe or wonder, cease
your search.

fortinbras. this quarry cries on havoc. o proud [[death]], what feast is
toward in thine eternal cell, that thou so many princes [[prince]] at a shot so
bloodily hast struck?

first ambassador. the sight is dismal; and our affairs from england
come too late. the ears are senseless that should give us hearing, to
tell him his commandment is fulfill’d, that rosencrantz and
guildenstern are [[dead]]. where should we have our thanks?

horatio. not from his mouth, had it th’ability of [[life]] to thank you. he
never gave commandment for their [[death]]. but since, so jump upon this
bloody [[question]], you from the polack wars [[war]], and you from [[england]] are
here arriv’d, give order that these bodies [[body]] high on a stage be placed to
the view, and let me speak to th’ yet unknowing [[world]] how these things
came about. so shall you hear of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, of
accidental judgments [[judgment]], casual slaughters, of deaths [[death]] put on by cunning
and forc’d cause, and, in this upshot, purposes [[purpose]] mistook fall’n on the
inventors’ heads. all this can i truly deliver.

fortinbras. let us haste to hear it, and call the noblest to the
audience. for me, with [[sorrow]] i embrace my [[fortune]]. i have some rights
of memory in this [[kingdom]], which now to claim my vantage doth invite
me.

horatio. of that i shall have also cause to speak, and from his mouth
whose voice will draw on more. but let this same be presently
perform’d, even while [[men’s]] minds [[mind]] are wild, lest more mischance on
plots and errors happen.

fortinbras. let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage,
for he was likely, had he been put on, to have prov’d most royally; and
for his passage, the soldiers’ [[music]] and the rites of [[war]] speak loudly
for him. take up the bodies [[body]]. such a sight as this becomes the field,
but here shows much amiss. go, bid the soldiers shoot.

 [_a [[dead]] march._]

 [_exeunt, bearing off the bodies [[body]], after which a peal of ordnance is
 shot off._]
