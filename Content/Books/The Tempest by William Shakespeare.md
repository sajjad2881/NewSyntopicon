the tempest.




act i.


scene i. _on a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder
and lightning heard._

  _enter _a ship-master_ and _a boatswain_._

_mast._ boatswain!

_boats._ here, master: what cheer?

_mast._ [[good]], speak to the mariners: fall to’t, yarely, or
we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.    [_exit._

  _enter _mariners_._

_boats._ heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!              5
yare, yare! take in the topsail. tend to the master’s
whistle. blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!

  _enter alonso, sebastian, antonio, ferdinand, gonzalo,
  and others._

_alon._ [[good]] boatswain, have [[care]]. where’s the master?
play the [[men]].

_boats._ i [[pray]] now, keep below.                                    10

_ant._ where is the master, boatswain?

_boats._ do you not hear him? you mar our [[labour]]:
keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.

_gon._ nay, [[good]], be patient.

_boats._ when the sea is. hence! what cares [[care]] these                   15
roarers for the name of [[king]]? to cabin: silence! trouble
us not.

_gon._ [[good]], yet [[remember]] whom thou hast aboard.

_boats._ none that i more [[love]] than myself. you are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to [[silence]],           20
and [[work]] the [[peace]] of the [[present]], we will not hand a rope
more; use your [[authority]]: if you cannot, give thanks you
have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin
for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. cheerly, good
hearts! out of our way, i say.    [_exit._                          25

_gon._ i have [[great]] comfort from this fellow: methinks
he hath no drowning mark upon him; his [[complexion]] is
perfect gallows. stand fast, [[good]] [[fate]], to his hanging:
make the rope of his [[destiny]] our cable, for our own doth
little advantage. if he be not born to be [[hanged]], our case          30
is miserable.    [_exeunt._

  _re-enter boatswain._

_boats._ down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower!
bring her to try with main-course. [_a cry within._] a
plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather
or our office.                                                      35

  _re-enter sebastian, antonio, and gonzalo._

yet again! what do you here? shall we give o’er, and
drown? have you a [[mind]] to sink?

_seb._ a pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!

_boats._ [[work]] you, then.                                            40

_ant._ hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noise-maker.
we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art [[arts]].

_gon._ i’ll warrant him for drowning; though the ship
were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched
wench.                                                              45

_boats._ lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off
to sea again; lay her off.

  _enter _mariners_ wet._

_mariners._ all lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

_boats._ what, must our mouths be cold?

_gon._ the [[king]] and [[prince]] at prayers! let’s assist them,           50
for our case is as theirs.

_seb._                   i’m out of patience.

_ant._ we are merely cheated of our lives [[life]] by drunkards:
this wide-chapp’d rascal,--would thou mightst [[lie]] drowning
the washing of ten tides!

_gon._                  he’ll be hang’d yet,
though every drop of water swear against it,                        55
and gape at widest to glut him.

  [_a confused noise within:_ “mercy on us!”--
  “we split, we split!”-- “farewell my [[wife]] and children!”--
  “farewell, brother!”-- “we split, we split, we split!”]

_ant._ let’s all sink with the [[king]].                                60

_seb._ let’s take leave of him. [_exeunt ant. and seb._

_gon._ now would i give a thousand furlongs of sea for
an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. the wills above be done! but i would fain [[die]] a
dry [[death]].    [_exeunt._                                            65

scene ii. _the island. before prospero’s cell._

  _enter prospero and miranda._

_mir._ if by your art [[arts]], my dearest [[father]], you have
put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
the [[sky]], it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
but that the sea, mounting to the welkin’s cheek,
dashes the [[fire]] out. o, i have suffer’d                              5
with those that i saw suffer! a brave vessel,
who had, no [[doubt]], some [[noble]] creature in her,
dash’d all to pieces. o, the cry did knock
against my very heart! [[poor]] souls [[soul]], they perish’d!
had i been any [[god]] of [[power]], i would                                10
have sunk the sea within the [[earth]], or ere
it should the [[good]] ship so have swallow’d and
the fraughting souls [[soul]] within her.

_pros._                        be collected:
no more amazement: tell your piteous heart
there’s no harm done.

_mir._              o, woe the day!

_pros._                           no harm.                          15
i have done nothing but in [[care]] of thee,
of thee, my dear one, thee, my [[daughter]], who
art ignorant of what thou art [[arts]], nought knowing
of whence i am, nor that i am more better
than prospero, master of a full [[poor]] cell,                          20
and thy no greater [[father]].

_mir._                   more to know
did never meddle with my thoughts [[thought]].

_pros._                          ’tis time
i should inform thee farther. lend thy hand,
and pluck my magic garment from me. --so:
                                [_lays down his mantle._
lie there, my art [[arts]]. wipe thou thine [[eyes]]; have comfort.              25
the direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch’d
the very [[virtue]] of compassion in thee,
i have with such provision in mine art
so safely order’d, that there is no [[soul]],
no, not so much perdition as an hair                                30
betid to any creature in the vessel
which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. sit down;
for thou must now [[know]] farther.

_mir._                        you have often
begun to tell me what i am; but stopp’d,
and left me to a bootless inquisition,                              35
concluding “stay: not yet.”

_pros._                the hour’s now come;
the very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
obey, and be attentive. canst thou remember
a [[time]] before we came unto this cell?
i do not [[think]] thou canst, for then thou wast not                   40
out three years old.

_mir._             certainly, sir, i can.

_pros._ by what? by any other house or [[person]]?
of any thing the image tell me that
hath kept with thy remembrance.

_mir._                        ’tis far off,
and rather like a [[dream]] than an assurance                           45
that my remembrance warrants. had i not
four or five [[women]] once that tended me?

_pros._ thou hadst, and more, miranda. but how is it
that this lives [[life]] in thy [[mind]]? what seest thou else
in the dark backward and abysm of [[time]]?                             50
if thou remember’st ought ere thou camest here,
how thou camest here thou mayst.

_mir._                         but that i do not.

_pros._ twelve year since, miranda, twelve year since,
thy [[father]] was the duke of milan, and
a [[prince]] of [[power]].

_mir._           sir, are not you my [[father]]?                        55

_pros._ thy [[mother]] was a piece of [[virtue]], and
she said thou wast my [[daughter]]; and thy father
was duke of milan; and his only heir
and princess, no worse issued.

_mir._                       o the heavens!
what foul play had we, that we came from thence?                    60
or blessed was’t we did?

_pros._                both, both, my girl:
by foul play, as thou say’st, were we heaved thence;
but blessedly holp hither.

_mir._                   o, my [[heart]] bleeds
to [[think]] o’ the teen that i have turn’d you to.
which is from my remembrance! please you, farther.                  65

_pros._ my [[brother]], and thy uncle, call’d antonio,--
i [[pray]] thee, mark me,--that a [[brother]] should
be so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself,
of all the [[world]] i loved, and to him put
the manage of my [[state]]; as, at that [[time]],                           70
through all the signories it was the first,
and prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
in [[dignity]], and for the liberal arts
without a parallel; those being all my study,
the [[government]] i cast upon my [[brother]],                              75
and to my [[state]] grew stranger, being transported
and rapt in secret studies. thy false uncle--
dost thou attend me?

_mir._             sir, most heedfully.

_pros._ being once perfected how to grant suits,
how to deny them, whom to advance, and whom                         80
to trash for over-topping, new created
the creatures that were mine, i say, or changed ’em,
or else new form’d ’em; having both the key
of officer and office, set all hearts [[heart]] i’ the state
to what tune pleased his ear; that now he was                       85
the ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
and suck’d my verdure out on’t. thou attend’st not.

_mir._ o, [[good]] sir, i do.

_pros._                 i [[pray]] thee, mark me.
i, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
to closeness and the bettering of my [[mind]]                           90
with that which, but by being so retired,
o’er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
awaked an [[evil]] [[nature]]; and my trust,
like a [[good]] parent, did beget of him
a falsehood in its contrary, as [[great]]                               95
as my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
a confidence sans bound. he being thus lorded,
not only with what my [[revenue]] yielded,
but what my [[power]] might else exact, like one
who having into [[truth]], by telling of it,                           100
made such a sinner of his memory,
to credit his own [[lie]], he did believe
he was indeed the duke; out o’ the substitution,
and executing the outward face of royalty,
with all prerogative:--hence his [[ambition]] growing,--               105
dost thou hear?

_mir._        your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

_pros._ to have no screen between this part he play’d
and him he play’d it for, he needs will be
absolute milan. me, [[poor]] [[man]], my library
was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties                    110
he thinks [[think]] me now incapable; confederates,
so dry he was for sway, wi’ the [[king]] of naples
to give him annual tribute, do him homage,
subject his coronet to his [[crown]], and bend
the dukedom, yet unbow’d,--alas, [[poor]] milan!--                     115
to most ignoble stooping.

_mir._                  o the heavens!

_pros._ mark his condition, and th’ event; then tell me
if this might be a [[brother]].

_mir._                    i should sin
to [[think]] but nobly of my grandmother:
good wombs have borne [[bad]] sons [[son]].

_pros._                       now the condition.                   120
this [[king]] of naples, being an enemy
to me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;
which was, that he, in lieu o’ the premises,
of homage and i [[know]] not how much tribute,
should presently extirpate me and mine                             125
out of the dukedom, and confer [[fair]] milan,
with all the honours [[honour]], on my [[brother]]: whereon,
a [[treacherous]] [[army]] levied, one midnight
fated to the [[purpose]], did antonio open
the gates of milan; and, i’ the [[dead]] of darkness,                  130
the ministers for the [[purpose]] hurried thence
me and thy crying [[self]].

_mir._                alack, for pity!
i, not remembering how i cried out then,
will cry it o’er again: it is a hint
that wrings mine [[eyes]] to’t.

_pros._                   hear a little further,                   135
and then i’ll bring thee to the [[present]] business
which now’s upon ’s; without the which, this story
were most impertinent.

_mir._               wherefore did they not
that hour [[destroy]] us?

_pros._             well demanded, wench:
my tale provokes that [[question]]. dear, they durst not,              140
so dear the [[love]] my [[people]] bore me; nor set
a mark so bloody on the [[business]]; but
with colours fairer painted their foul ends.
in few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared                   145
a rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg’d,
nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,
to cry to the sea that roar’d to us; to sigh
to the winds, whose [[pity]], sighing back again,                      150
did us but loving [[wrong]].

_mir._                 alack, what trouble
was i then to you!

_pros._          o, a cherubin
thou wast that did preserve me. thou didst smile,
infused with a fortitude from [[heaven]],
when i have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,                   155
under my burthen groan’d; which raised in me
an undergoing stomach, to bear up
against what should ensue.

_mir._                   how came we ashore?

_pros._ by providence [[divine]].
some food we had, and some fresh water, that                       160
a [[noble]] neapolitan, gonzalo,
out of his charity, who being then appointed
master of this design, did give us, with
rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,              165
knowing i loved my books [[book]], he furnish’d me
from mine own library with volumes that
i prize above my dukedom.

_mir._                  would i might
but ever see that man!

_pros._              now i arise:  [_resumes his mantle._
sit still, and hear the [[last]] of our sea-sorrow.                    170
here in this island we arrived; and here
have i, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
than other princesses can, that have more time
for vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.

_mir._ heavens [[heaven]] thank you for’t! and now, i [[pray]] you, sir,          175
for still ’tis beating in my [[mind]], your reason
for raising this sea-storm?

_pros._                   [[know]] thus far forth.
by accident most [[strange]], bountiful [[fortune]],
now my dear [[lady]], hath mine enemies
brought to this shore; and by my prescience                        180
i find my zenith doth depend upon
a most auspicious star, whose influence
if now i court not, but omit, my fortunes
will ever after droop. here cease more questions [[question]]:
thou art [[arts]] inclined to sleep; ’tis a [[good]] dulness,                   185
and give it way: i [[know]] thou canst not choose.
                                        [_miranda sleeps._
come away, servant, come. i am ready now.
approach, my ariel, come.

  _enter _ariel_._

_ari._ all hail, [[great]] master! grave sir, hail! i come
to [[answer]] thy [[best]] [[pleasure]]; be’t to fly,                          190
to swim, to dive into the [[fire]], to ride
on the curl’d clouds, to thy [[strong]] bidding task
ariel and all his quality.

_pros._                  hast thou, spirit,
perform’d to point the tempest that i bade thee?

_ari._ to every article.                                           195
i boarded the king’s ship; now on the beak,
now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
i flamed amazement: sometime i’ld divide,
and burn in many places; on the topmast,
the yards and bowsprit, would i flame distinctly,                  200
then meet and join. jove’s lightnings, the precursors
o’ the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
and sight-outrunning were not: the [[fire]] and cracks
of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune
seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,                  205
yea, his dread trident shake.

_pros._                     my brave spirit!
who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
would not infect his [[reason]]?

_ari._                     not a soul
but [[felt]] a fever of the mad, and play’d
some tricks of desperation. all but mariners                       210
plunged in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel,
then all afire with me: the king’s [[son]], ferdinand,
with hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
was the first [[man]] that leap’d; cried, “hell is empty,
and all the devils [[devil]] are here.”

_pros._                 why, that’s my spirit!                     215
but was not this nigh shore?

_ari._                    close by, my master.

_pros._ but are they, ariel, safe?

_ari._                           not a hair perish’d;
on their sustaining garments not a blemish,
but fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
in [[troops]] i have dispersed them ’bout the isle.                    220
the king’s [[son]] have i landed by himself;
whom i left cooling of the air with sighs
in an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,
his arms in this [[sad]] knot.

_pros._                  of the king’s ship
the mariners, say how thou hast disposed,                          225
and all the rest o’ the fleet.

_ari._                       safely in harbour
is the king’s ship; in the deep nook, where once
thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
from the still-vex’d bermoothes, there she’s hid:
the mariners all under hatches stow’d;                             230
who, with a charm join’d to their suffer’d [[labour]],
i have left asleep: and for the rest o’ the fleet,
which i dispersed, they all have met again,
and are upon the mediterranean flote,
bound sadly [[home]] for naples;                                       235
supposing that they saw the king’s ship wreck’d,
and his [[great]] [[person]] perish.

_pros._                    ariel, thy charge
exactly is perform’d: but there’s more [[work]].
what is the [[time]] o’ the day?

_ari._                     [[past]] the mid season.

_pros._ at least two glasses. the [[time]] ’twixt six and now          240
must by us both be spent most preciously.

_ari._ is there more toil? since thou dost give me pains [[pain]],
let me [[remember]] thee what thou hast promised,
which is not yet perform’d me.

_pros._                      how now? moody?
what is’t thou canst demand?

_ari._                     my [[liberty]].                             245

_pros._ before the [[time]] be out? no more!

_ari._                                 i prithee,
remember i have done thee worthy service;
told thee no lies [[lie]], made thee no mistakings, served
without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
to bate me a full year.

_pros._               dost thou forget                             250
from what a torment i did [[free]] thee?

_ari._                             no.

_pros._ thou dost; and think’st it much to tread the ooze
of the salt deep,
to run upon the sharp wind of the north,
to do me [[business]] in the veins o’ the [[earth]]                        255
when it is baked with frost.

_ari._                     i do not, sir.

_pros._ thou liest, malignant thing! hast thou forgot
the foul witch sycorax, who with [[age]] and envy
was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?

_ari._ no, sir.

_pros._       thou hast. where was she born? speak; tell me.       260

_ari._ sir, in argier.

_pros._              o, was she so? i must
once in a month recount what thou hast been,
which thou forget’st. this damn’d witch sycorax,
for mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible
to enter [[human]] hearing, from argier,                               265
thou know’st, was banish’d: for one thing she did
they would not take her [[life]]. is not this true?

_ari._ ay, sir.

_pros._ this blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child,
and here was left by the sailors. thou, my [[slave]],                  270
as thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant;
and, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
to act her earthy and abhorr’d commands,
refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
by [[help]] of her more potent ministers,                              275
and in her most unmitigable rage,
into a cloven pine; within which rift
imprison’d thou didst painfully remain
a dozen years; within which space she died,
and left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans              280
as fast as mill-wheels strike. then was this island--
save for the [[son]] that she did litter here,
a freckled whelp hag-born--not honour’d with
a [[human]] shape.

_ari._       yes, caliban her [[son]].

_pros._ dull thing, i say so; he, that caliban,                    285
whom now i keep in service. thou [[best]] know’st
what torment i did find thee in; thy groans
did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts
of ever-angry bears: it was a torment
to lay upon the damn’d, which sycorax                              290
could not again undo: it was mine art [[arts]],
when i arrived and heard thee, that made gape
the pine, and let thee out.

_ari._                    i thank thee, master.

_pros._ if thou more murmur’st, i will rend an oak,
and peg thee in his knotty entrails, till                          295
thou hast howl’d away twelve winters.

_ari._                              pardon, master:
i will be correspondent to command,
and do my spiriting gently.

_pros._                   do so; and after two days
i will discharge thee.

_ari._               that’s my [[noble]] master!
what shall i do? say what; what shall i do?                        300

_pros._ go make thyself like a [[nymph]] o’ the sea:
be [[subject]] to no sight but thine and mine; invisible
to every eyeball else. go take this shape,
and hither come in’t: go, hence with diligence!

    [_exit ariel._

awake, dear [[heart]], awake! thou hast slept well;                    305
awake!

_mir._ the strangeness of your story put
heaviness in me.

_pros._        shake it off. come on;
we’ll visit caliban my [[slave]], who never
yields us [[kind]] [[answer]].

_mir._               ’tis a villain, sir,
i do not [[love]] to look on.

_pros._                 but, as ’tis,                              310
we cannot miss him: he does make our [[fire]],
fetch in our wood, and serves in offices
that [[profit]] us. what, ho! slave! caliban!
thou [[earth]], thou! speak.

_cal._ [_within_] there’s wood enough within.

_pros._ come forth, i say! there’s other [[business]] for thee:        315
come, thou tortoise! when?

  _re-enter ariel like a water-nymph._

fine apparition! my quaint ariel,
hark in thine ear.

_ari._           my [[lord]], it shall be done.    [_exit._

_pros._ thou poisonous [[slave]], got by the [[devil]] himself
upon thy wicked dam, come forth!                                   320

  _enter caliban._

_cal._ as wicked dew as e’er my [[mother]] brush’d
with raven’s feather from unwholesome fen
drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
and blister you all o’er!

_pros._ for this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,        325
side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
shall, for that vast of night that they may [[work]],
all exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch’d
as thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
than bees that made ’em.

_cal._                 i must [[eat]] my dinner.                       330
this island’s mine, by sycorax my [[mother]],
which thou takest from me. when thou camest first,
thou strokedst me, and madest much of me; wouldst give me
water with berries in’t; and [[teach]] me how
to name the bigger [[light]], and how the less,                        335
that burn by day and night: and then i loved thee,
and show’d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,
the fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
curs’d be i that did so! all the charms
of sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, [[light]] on you!                    340
for i am all the subjects [[subject]] that you have,
which first was mine own [[king]]: and here you sty me
in this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
the rest o’ th’ island.

_pros._               thou most lying [[slave]],
whom stripes may move, not kindness! i have used thee,             345
filth as thou art [[arts]], with [[human]] [[care]]; and lodged thee
in mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
the [[honour]] of my child.

_cal._ o ho, o ho! would ’t had been done!
thou didst prevent me; i had peopled else                          350
this isle with calibans.

_pros._                abhorred [[slave]],
which any print of goodness wilt not take,
being capable of all ill! i pitied thee,
took pains [[pain]] to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
one thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,                   355
know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
a thing most brutish, i endow’d thy purposes
with words that made them known. but thy vile [[race]],
though thou didst learn, had that in’t which [[good]] natures
could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou                    360
deservedly confined into this rock,
who hadst deserved more than a prison.

_cal._ you taught me [[language]]; and my [[profit]] on’t
is, i [[know]] how to curse. the red plague rid you
for learning me your language!

_pros._                      hag-seed, hence!                      365
fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou’rt [[best]],
to [[answer]] other [[business]]. shrug’st thou, malice?
if thou neglect’st, or dost unwillingly
what i command, i’ll rack thee with old cramps,
fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,                     370
that beasts shall tremble at thy din.

_cal._                              no, [[pray]] thee.
[_aside_] i must obey: his art [[arts]] is of such [[power]],
it would control my dam’s [[god]], setebos,
and make a vassal of him.

_pros._                 so, [[slave]]; hence!    [_exit caliban._

  _re-enter ariel, invisible, playing and singing; ferdinand
  following._

_ariel’s [[song]]._

    come unto these yellow sands,                                  375
        and then take hands:
    courtsied when you have and kiss’d
        the wild waves whist:
    foot it featly here and there;
    and, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.                          380

 _burthen_ [_dispersedly_]. hark, hark!
                           bow-wow.
        the watch-dogs bark:
                            bow-wow.

_ari._  hark, hark! i hear
        the strain of strutting chanticleer                        385
        cry, cock-a-diddle-dow.

_fer._ where should this [[music]] be? i’ th’ air or th’ [[earth]]?
it sounds no more: and, sure, it waits upon
some [[god]] o’ th’ island. sitting on a bank,
weeping again the [[king]] my father’s wreck,                          390
this [[music]] crept by me upon the waters,
allaying both their fury and my passion
with its sweet air: thence i have follow’d it.
or it hath drawn me rather. but ’tis gone.
no, it begins again.                                               395

_ariel sings._

    full fathom five thy [[father]] lies [[lie]];
        of his bones are coral made;
    those are pearls that were his [[eyes]]:
        nothing of him that doth fade,
    but doth suffer a sea-change                                   400
    into something [[rich]] and [[strange]].
    sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:

                    _burthen:_ ding-dong.

_ari._ hark! now i hear them,--ding-dong, bell.

_fer._ the ditty does [[remember]] my drown’d [[father]].                  405
this is no mortal [[business]], nor no sound
that the [[earth]] owes:--i hear it now above me.

_pros._ the fringed curtains of thine eye advance,
and say what thou seest yond.

_mir._                      what is’t? a spirit?
lord, how it looks about! [[believe]] me, sir,                         410
it carries a brave form. but ’tis a spirit.

_pros._ no, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
as we have, such. this gallant which thou seest
was in the wreck; and, but he’s something stain’d
with [[grief]], that’s beauty’s canker, thou mightst call him          415
a goodly [[person]]: he hath lost his fellows,
and strays about to find ’em.

_mir._                      i might call him
a thing [[divine]]; for nothing natural
i ever saw so [[noble]].

_pros._ [_aside_] it goes on, i see,
as my [[soul]] prompts it. spirit, fine spirit! i’ll [[free]] thee         420
within two days for this.

_fer._                  most sure, the goddess
on whom these airs attend! vouchsafe my prayer
may [[know]] if you remain upon this island;
and that you will some [[good]] instruction give
how i may bear me here: my prime request,                          425
which i do [[last]] pronounce, is, o you wonder!
if you be maid or no?

_mir._              no wonder, sir;
but certainly a maid.

_fer._              my language! heavens!
i am the [[best]] of them that speak this [[speech]],
were i but where ’tis spoken.

_pros._                     how? the [[best]]?                         430
what wert thou, if the [[king]] of naples heard thee?

_fer._ a [[single]] thing, as i am now, that wonders
to hear thee speak of naples. he does hear me;
and that he does i weep: myself am naples,
who with mine [[eyes]], never since at ebb, beheld                     435
the [[king]] my [[father]] wreck’d.

_mir._                    alack, for mercy!

_fer._ yes, [[faith]], and all his lords [[lord]]; the duke of milan
and his brave [[son]] being twain.

_pros._                      [_aside_] the duke of milan
and his more braver [[daughter]] could control thee,
if now ’twere fit to do’t. at the first sight                      440
they have changed [[eyes]]. delicate ariel,
i’ll set thee [[free]] for this. [_to fer._] a word, [[good]] sir;
i [[fear]] you have done yourself some [[wrong]]: a word.

_mir._ why speaks my [[father]] so ungently? this
is the third [[man]] that e’er i saw; the first                        445
that e’er i sigh’d for: [[pity]] move my father
to be inclined my way!

_fer._               o, if a virgin,
and your affection not gone forth, i’ll make you
the queen of naples.

_pros._            soft, sir! one word more.
[_aside_] they are both in either’s powers [[power]]:
        but this swift [[business]]                                    450
i must uneasy make, lest too [[light]] winning
make the prize [[light]]. [_to fer._] one word more; i charge thee
that thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
the name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
upon this island as a spy, to [[win]] it                               455
from me, the [[lord]] on’t.

_fer._                no, as i am a [[man]].

_mir._ there’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
if the ill spirit have so [[fair]] a house,
good things will strive to dwell with’t.

_pros._                                [[follow]] me.
speak not you for him; he’s a traitor. come;                       460
i’ll manacle thy neck and feet together:
sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
the fresh-brook muscles, wither’d roots, and husks
wherein the acorn cradled. [[follow]].

_fer._                           no;
i will resist such entertainment till                              465
mine [[enemy]] has more [[power]].
            [_draws, and is charmed from moving._

_mir._                o dear [[father]],
make not too rash a [[trial]] of him, for
he’s gentle, and not fearful.

_pros._                     what! i say,
my foot my tutor? put thy [[sword]] up, traitor;
who makest a show, but darest not strike, thy [[conscience]]           470
is so possess’d with guilt: come from thy ward;
for i can here disarm thee with this stick
and make thy weapon drop.

_mir._                  beseech you, [[father]].

_pros._ hence! hang not on my garments.

_mir._                                sir, have [[pity]];
i’ll be his surety.

_pros._           silence! one word more                           475
shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. what!
an advocate for an impostor! hush!
thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he,
having seen but him and caliban: foolish wench!
to the most of [[men]] this is a caliban,                              480
and they to him are angels.

_mir._                    my affections
are, then, most humble; i have no ambition
to see a goodlier [[man]].

_pros._              come on; obey:
thy nerves are in their infancy again,
and have no vigour in them.

_fer._             so they are:                                    485
my spirits, as in a [[dream]], are all bound up.
my father’s loss, the weakness which i [[feel]],
the wreck of all my [[friends]], nor this man’s threats,
to whom i am subdued, are but [[light]] to me,
might i but through my prison once a day                           490
behold this maid: all corners else o’ th’ earth
let [[liberty]] make use of; space enough
have i in such a prison.

_pros._ [_aside_]      it works [[work]]. [_to fer._] come on.
thou hast done well, fine ariel! [_to fer._] [[follow]] me.
[_to ari._] hark what thou else shalt do me.

_mir._                                     be of comfort;          495
my father’s of a [[better]] [[nature]], sir,
than he appears by [[speech]]: this is unwonted
which now came from him.

_pros._                thou shalt be as free
as mountain winds: but then exactly do
all points of my command.

_ari._                  to the syllable.                           500

_pros._ come, [[follow]]. speak not for him.    [_exeunt._

act ii.


scene i. _another part of the island._

  _enter alonso, sebastian, antonio, gonzalo, adrian, francisco,
  and others._

_gon._ beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
so have we all, of joy; for our escape
is much beyond our loss. our hint of woe
is [[common]]; every day, some sailor’s [[wife]],
the masters of some merchant, and the merchant,                      5
have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
i mean our preservation, few in millions
can speak like us: then wisely, [[good]] sir, weigh
our [[sorrow]] with our comfort.

_alon._                    prithee, [[peace]].

_seb._ he receives comfort like cold porridge.                      10

_ant._ the visitor will not give him o’er so.

_seb._ look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit; by
and by it will strike.

_gon._ sir,--

_seb._ one: tell.                                                   15

_gon._ when every [[grief]] is entertain’d that’s offer’d,
comes to the entertainer--

_seb._ a dollar.

_gon._ dolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken
truer than you purposed.                                            20

_seb._ you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should.

_gon._ therefore, my [[lord]],--

_ant._ fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

_alon._ i prithee, spare.

_gon._ well, i have done: but yet,--                                25

_seb._ he will be talking.

_ant._ which, of he or adrian, for a [[good]] wager, first
begins to crow?

_seb._ the old cock.

_ant._ the cockerel.                                                30

_seb._ done. the wager?

_ant._ a laughter.

_seb._ a match!

_adr._ though this island seem to be desert,--

_seb._ ha, ha, ha!--so, you’re paid.                                35

_adr._ uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible,--

_seb._ yet,--

_adr._ yet,--

_ant._ he could not miss’t.

_adr._ it must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate              40
temperance.

_ant._ temperance was a delicate wench.

_seb._ ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.

_adr._ the air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

_seb._ as if it had lungs, and rotten ones.                         45

_ant._ or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.

_gon._ here is every thing advantageous to [[life]].

_ant._ true; save means to [[live]].

_seb._ of that there’s none, or little.

_gon._ how lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!               50

_ant._ the ground, indeed, is tawny.

_seb._ with an eye of green in’t.

_ant._ he misses not much.

_seb._ no; he doth but mistake the [[truth]] totally.

_gon._ but the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost             55
beyond credit,--

_seb._ as many vouched rarities are.

_gon._ that our garments, being, as they were, drenched
in the sea, hold, notwithstanding, their freshness and glosses,
being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.                 60

_ant._ if but one of his pockets could speak, would it
not say he lies [[lie]]?

_seb._ ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.

_gon._ methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
we put them on first in afric, at the [[marriage]] of the king’s        65
fair [[daughter]] claribel to the [[king]] of tunis.

_seb._ ’twas a sweet [[marriage]], and we [[prosper]] well in
our return.

_adr._ tunis was never graced before with such a paragon
to their queen.                                                     70

_gon._ not since widow dido’s [[time]].

_ant._ widow! a pox o’ that! how came that widow
in? widow dido!

_seb._ what if he had said ‘widower æneas’ too? good
lord, how you take it!                                              75

_adr._ ‘widow dido’ said you? you make me study of
that: she was of [[carthage]], not of tunis.

_gon._ this tunis, sir, was [[carthage]].

_adr._ [[carthage]]?

_gon._ i assure you, [[carthage]].                                      80

_seb._ his word is more than the miraculous harp; he
hath raised the wall, and houses too.

_ant._ what impossible matter will he make easy next?

_seb._ i [[think]] he will carry this island [[home]] in his
pocket, and give it his [[son]] for an apple.                           85

_ant._ and, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
forth more islands.

_gon._ ay.

_ant._ why, in [[good]] [[time]].

_gon._ sir, we were talking that our garments seem now              90
as fresh as when we were at tunis at the [[marriage]] of your
daughter, who is now queen.

_ant._ and the rarest that e’er came there.

_seb._ bate, i beseech you, widow dido.

_ant._ o, widow dido! ay, widow dido.                               95

_gon._ is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day i
wore it? i mean, in a sort.

_ant._ that sort was well fished for.

_gon._ when i wore it at your daughter’s [[marriage]]?

_alon._ you cram these words into mine ears against                100
the stomach of my sense. would i had never
married my [[daughter]] there! for, coming thence,
my [[son]] is lost, and, in my rate, she too.
who is so far from [[italy]] removed
i ne’er again shall see her. o thou mine heir                      105
of naples and of milan, what [[strange]] fish
hath made his meal on thee?

_fran._                   sir, he may [[live]]:
i saw him beat the surges under him,
and ride upon their backs; he trod the water.
whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted                          110
the surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
’bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar’d
himself with his [[good]] arms in lusty stroke
to the shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bow’d,
as stooping to relieve him: i not [[doubt]]                            115
he came alive to [[land]].

_alon._              no, no, he’s gone.

_seb._ sir, you may thank yourself for this [[great]] loss,
that would not bless our [[europe]] with your [[daughter]],
but rather lose her to an african;
where she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,                    120
who hath cause to wet the [[grief]] on’t.

_alon._                             prithee, [[peace]].

_seb._ you were kneel’d to, and importuned otherwise,
by all of us; and the [[fair]] [[soul]] herself
weigh’d between loathness and [[obedience]], at
which end o’ the beam should bow. we have lost your [[son]],           125
i [[fear]], for ever: milan and naples have
more widows in them of this business’ making
than we bring [[men]] to comfort them:
the fault’s your own.

_alon._             so is the dear’st o’ the loss.

_gon._ my [[lord]] sebastian,                                          130
the [[truth]] you speak doth lack some gentleness,
and [[time]] to speak it in: you rub the sore,
when you should bring the plaster.

_seb._                           very well.

_ant._ and most chirurgeonly.

_gon._ it is foul weather in us all, [[good]] sir,                     135
when you are cloudy.

_seb._             foul weather?

_ant._                         very foul.

_gon._ had i plantation of this isle, my [[lord]],--

_ant._ he’ld sow’t with nettle-seed.

_seb._                             or docks, or mallows.

_gon._ and were the [[king]] on’t, what would i do?

_seb._ ’scape being drunk for want of wine.                        140

_gon._ i’ the commonwealth i would by contraries
execute all things; for no [[kind]] of traffic
would i admit; no name of magistrate;
letters should not be known; riches [[rich]], [[poverty]],
and use of service, none; contract, succession,                    145
bourn, bound of [[land]], tilth, vineyard, none;
no use of metal, corn, or wine, or [[oil]];
no occupation; all [[men]] idle, all;
and [[women]] too, but [[innocent]] and pure;
no sovereignty;--                                                  150

_seb._      yet he would be [[king]] on’t.

_ant._ the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.

_gon._ all things in [[common]] [[nature]] should produce
without sweat or endeavour: [[treason]], felony,
sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,                    155
would i not have; but [[nature]] should bring forth,
of its own [[kind]], all foison, all abundance,
to feed my [[innocent]] [[people]].

_seb._ no marrying ’mong his subjects [[subject]]?

_ant._ none, [[man]]; all idle; whores and knaves.                     160

_gon._ i would with such [[perfection]] govern, sir,
to excel the golden [[age]].

_seb._                 ’save his majesty!

_ant._ long [[live]] gonzalo!

_gon._                  and,--do you mark me, sir?

_alon._ prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.

_gon._ i do well [[believe]] your highness; and did it to minister     165
occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible
and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.

_ant._ ’twas you we laughed at.

_gon._ who in this [[kind]] of merry fooling am nothing to
you: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.              170

_ant._ what a blow was there given!

_seb._ an it had not fallen flat-long.

_gon._ you are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would
lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it
five weeks without changing.                                       175


  _enter ariel (invisible) playing solemn [[music]]._

_seb._ we would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

_ant._ nay, [[good]] my [[lord]], be not angry.

_gon._ no, i warrant you; i will not adventure my discretion
so weakly. will you laugh me asleep, for i am very
heavy?                                                             180

_ant._ go sleep, and hear us.
            [_all sleep except alon., seb., and ant._

_alon._ what, all so soon asleep! i [[wish]] mine eyes
would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts [[thought]]: i find
they are inclined to do so.

_seb._                    please you, sir,
do not omit the heavy offer of it:                                 185
it seldom visits [[sorrow]]; when it doth,
it is a comforter.

_ant._           we two, my [[lord]],
will guard your [[person]] while you take your rest,
and watch your safety.

_alon._              thank you.--wondrous heavy.
                                [_alonso sleeps. exit ariel._

_seb._ what a [[strange]] drowsiness possesses them!                   190

_ant._ it is the quality o’ the [[climate]].

_seb._                                 why
doth it not then our eyelids sink? i find not
myself disposed to sleep.

_ant._                  nor i; my spirits are nimble.
they fell together all, as by [[consent]];
they dropp’d, as by a thunder-stroke. what might,                  195
worthy sebastian?--o, what might?--no more:--
and yet methinks i see it in thy face,
what thou shouldst be: the [[occasion]] speaks thee; and
my [[strong]] [[imagination]] sees a crown
dropping upon thy head.

_seb._                what, art [[arts]] thou waking?                       200

_ant._ do you not hear me speak?

_seb._                         i do; and surely
it is a sleepy [[language]], and thou speak’st
out of thy sleep. what is it thou didst say?
this is a [[strange]] repose, to be asleep
with [[eyes]] wide open; standing, speaking, moving,                   205
and yet so fast asleep.

_ant._                [[noble]] sebastian,
thou let’st thy [[fortune]] sleep--die, rather; wink’st
whiles thou art [[arts]] waking.

_seb._                thou dost snore distinctly;
there’s meaning in thy snores.

_ant._ i am more serious than my custom: you                       210
must be so too, if heed me; which to do
trebles thee o’er.

_seb._           well, i am standing water.

_ant._ i’ll [[teach]] you how to flow.

_seb._                           do so: to ebb
hereditary sloth instructs me.

_ant._                       o,
if you but knew how you the [[purpose]] cherish                        215
whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
you more invest it! ebbing [[men]], indeed,
most often do so near the bottom run
by their own [[fear]] or sloth.

_seb._                    prithee, say on:
the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim                        220
a matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,
which throes thee much to yield.

_ant._                         thus, sir:
although this [[lord]] of [[weak]] remembrance, this,
who shall be of as little memory
when he is earth’d, hath here almost persuaded,--                  225
for he’s a spirit of persuasion, only
professes to persuade,--the [[king]] his son’s alive,
’tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d
as he that sleeps here swims.

_seb._                      i have no hope
that he’s undrown’d.

_ant._             o, out of that ‘no hope’                        230
what [[great]] [[hope]] have you! no [[hope]] that way is
another way so high a [[hope]] that even
ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
but [[doubt]] discovery there. will you grant with me
that ferdinand is drown’d?

_seb._                   he’s gone.

_ant._                            then, tell me,                   235
who’s the next heir of naples?

_seb._                       claribel.

_ant._ she that is queen of tunis; she that dwells
ten leagues beyond man’s [[life]]; she that from naples
can have no note, unless the sun were post,--
the [[man]] i’ the moon’s too slow,--till new-born chins               240
be rough and razorable; she that from whom
we all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again,
and by that [[destiny]], to perform an act
whereof what’s [[past]] is prologue; what to come,
in yours and my discharge.

_seb._                   what stuff is this! how say you?          245
’tis true, my brother’s daughter’s queen of tunis;
so is she heir of naples; ’twixt which regions
there is some space.

_ant._             a space whose every cubit
seems to cry out, “how shall that claribel
measure us back to naples? keep in tunis,                          250
and let sebastian wake.” say, this were death
that now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
than now they are. there be that can [[rule]] naples
as well as he that sleeps; lords [[lord]] that can prate
as amply and unnecessarily                                         255
as this gonzalo; i myself could make
a chough of as deep chat. o, that you bore
the [[mind]] that i do! what a sleep were this
for your advancement! do you [[understand]] me?

_seb._ methinks i do.

_ant._              and how does your content                      260
tender your own [[good]] [[fortune]]?

_seb._                      i remember
you did supplant your [[brother]] prospero.

_ant._                                true:
and look how well my garments sit upon me;
much feater than before: my brother’s servants
were then my fellows; now they are my [[men]].                         265

_seb._ but for your [[conscience]].

_ant._ ay, sir; where lies [[lie]] that? if ’twere a kibe,
’twould put me to my slipper: but i [[feel]] not
this deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
that stand ’twixt me and milan, candied be they,                   270
and melt, ere they molest! here lies [[lie]] your [[brother]],
no [[better]] than the [[earth]] he lies [[lie]] upon,
if he were that which now he’s like, that’s [[dead]];
whom i, with this [[obedient]] steel, three inches of it,
can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,                   275
to the perpetual wink for aye might put
this ancient morsel, this sir prudence, who
should not upbraid our course. for all the rest,
they’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
they’ll tell the clock to any [[business]] that                        280
we say befits the hour.

_seb._                thy case, dear friend,
shall be my precedent; as thou got’st milan,
i’ll come by naples. draw thy [[sword]]: one stroke
shall [[free]] thee from the tribute which thou payest;
and i the [[king]] shall [[love]] thee.

_ant._                        draw together;                       285
and when i rear my hand, do you the like,
to fall it on gonzalo.

_seb._               o, but one word.      [_they talk apart._

  _re-enter ariel invisible._

_ari._ my master through his art [[arts]] foresees the danger
that you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth,--
for else his project dies,--to keep them living.                   290
                            [_sings in gonzalo’s ear._

while you here do snoring [[lie]],
open-eyed conspiracy
    his [[time]] doth take.
if of [[life]] you keep a [[care]],
shake off slumber, and beware:                                     295
    awake, awake!

_ant._ then let us both be sudden.

_gon._                           now, [[good]] angels
preserve the king!                          [_they wake._

_alon._ why, how now? ho, awake!--why are you drawn?
wherefore this ghastly looking?

_gon._                        what’s the matter?                   300

_seb._ whiles we stood here securing your repose,
even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
like bulls, or rather lions: did’t not wake you?
it struck mine ear most terribly.

_alon._                         i heard nothing.

_ant._ o, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,                   305
to make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
of a whole herd of lions.

_alon._                 heard you this, gonzalo?

_gon._ upon mine [[honour]], sir, i heard a humming,
and that a [[strange]] one too, which did awake me:
i shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine [[eyes]] open’d,                 310
i saw their [[weapons]] drawn:--there was a noise,
that’s verily. ’tis [[best]] we stand upon our guard,
or that we quit this place: let’s draw our [[weapons]].

_alon._ lead off this ground; and let’s make further search
for my [[poor]] [[son]].

_gon._         heavens [[heaven]] keep him from these beasts!                 315
for he is, sure, i’ th’ island.

_alon._                       lead away.

_ari._ prospero my [[lord]] shall [[know]] what i have done:
so, [[king]], go safely on to seek thy [[son]].    [_exeunt._

scene ii. _another part of the island._

  _enter caliban with a burden of wood. a noise of thunder heard._

_cal._ all the infections that the sun sucks up
from bogs, fens, flats, on [[prosper]] fall, and make him
by inch-meal a disease! his spirits hear me,
and yet i needs must curse. but they’ll nor pinch,
fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ the mire,                   5
nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
out of my way, unless he bid ’em: but
for every trifle are they set upon me;
sometime like apes, that mow and chatter at me,
and after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which                       10
lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount
their pricks at my footfall; sometime am i
all wound with adders, who with cloven tongues
do hiss me into madness.

  _enter trinculo._

                        lo, now, lo!
here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me                       15
for bringing wood in slowly. i’ll fall flat;
perchance he will not [[mind]] me.

_trin._ here’s neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any
weather at all, and another storm brewing; i hear it sing i’
the wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks               20
like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. if it should
thunder as it did before, i [[know]] not where to hide my head:
yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. what
have we here? a [[man]] or a fish? [[dead]] or alive? a fish: he
smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a [[kind]]      25
of not of the newest poor-john. a [[strange]] fish! were i
in [[england]] now, as once i was, and had but this fish
painted, not a holiday [[fool]] there but would give a piece of
silver: there would this monster make a [[man]]; any strange
beast there makes a [[man]]: when they will not give a doit to          30
relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead
indian. legged like a man! and his fins like arms! warm
o’ my troth! i do now let loose my [[opinion]]; hold it no
longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately
suffered by a thunderbolt. [_thunder._] alas, the storm is come     35
again! my [[best]] way is to creep under his gaberdine; there
is no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a [[man]] with
strange bed-fellows. i will here shroud till the dregs of the
storm be [[past]].

  _enter stephano, singing: a bottle in his hand._

_ste._ i shall no more to sea, to sea,                              40
                here shall i [[die]] a-shore,--

this is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s [[funeral]]: well,
here’s my comfort.                                  [_drinks._


[_sings._ the master, the swabber, the boatswain, and i,
                       the gunner, and his mate,                    45
               loved mall, meg, and marian, and margery,
                   but none of us cared for kate;
                   for she had a tongue with a tang,
                   would cry to a sailor, go hang!
               she loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch;        50
               yet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch.
                   then, to sea, boys, and let her go hang!

this is a scurvy tune too: but here’s my comfort. [_drinks._

_cal._ do not torment me:--o!

_ste._ what’s the matter? have we devils [[devil]] here? do                   55
you put tricks upon ’s with savages and [[men]] of ind, ha? i
have not scaped drowning, to be afeard now of your four
legs; for it hath been said, as proper a [[man]] as ever went
on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be
said so again, while stephano breathes at’s nostrils.               60

_cal._ the spirit torments me:--o!

_ste._ this is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
hath got, as i take it, an ague. where the [[devil]] should he
learn our [[language]]? i will give him some relief, if it be
but for that. if i can recover him, and keep him tame, and          65
get to naples with him, he’s a [[present]] for any [[emperor]] that
ever trod on neat’s-leather.

_cal._ do not torment me, prithee; i’ll bring my wood
home faster.

_ste._ he’s in his fit now, and does not talk after the             70
wisest. he shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk
wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. if i can recover
him, and keep him tame, i will not take too much for
him; he shall [[pay]] for him that hath him, and that soundly.

_cal._ thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, i          75
know it by thy trembling: now [[prosper]] works [[work]] upon thee.

_ste._ come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
which will give [[language]] to you, cat: open your mouth; this
will shake your shaking, i can tell you, and that soundly:
you cannot tell who’s your friend: open your chaps again.           80

_trin._ i should [[know]] that voice: it should be--but he
is drowned; and these are devils [[devil]]:--o defend me!

_ste._ four legs and two voices,--a most delicate monster!
his forward voice, now, is to speak well of his friend;
his backward voice is to utter foul speeches [[speech]] and to detract.        85
if all the wine in my bottle will recover him, i will help
his ague. come:--amen! i will pour some in thy other
mouth.

_trin._ stephano!

_ste._ doth thy other mouth call me? [[mercy]], mercy!                  90
this is a [[devil]], and no monster: i will leave him; i have
no long spoon.

_trin._ stephano! if thou beest stephano, touch me,
and speak to me; for i am trinculo,--be not afeard,--thy
good friend trinculo.                                               95

_ste._ if thou beest trinculo, come forth: i’ll pull thee
by the lesser legs: if any be trinculo’s legs, these are they.
thou art [[arts]] very trinculo indeed! how earnest thou to be
the siege of this moon-calf? can he vent trinculos?

_trin._ i took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.             100
but art [[arts]] thou not drowned, stephano? i [[hope]], now, thou
art not drowned. is the storm overblown? i hid me
under the [[dead]] moon-calf’s gaberdine for [[fear]] of the storm.
and art [[arts]] thou living, stephano? o stephano, two neapolitans
scaped!                                                            105

_ste._ prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
constant.

_cal._ [_aside_] these be fine things, an if they be not sprites.
that’s a brave [[god]], and bears celestial liquor:
i will kneel to him.                                               110

_ste._ how didst thou ’scape? how camest thou hither?
swear, by this bottle, how thou camest hither. i escaped
upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o’erboard, by
this bottle! which i made of the bark of a tree with mine
own hands, since i was cast ashore.                                115

_cal._ i’ll swear, upon that bottle, to be thy true [[subject]];
for the liquor is not earthly.

_ste._ here; swear, then, how thou escapedst.

_trin._ swum ashore, [[man]], like a duck: i can swim
like a duck, i’ll be sworn.                                        120

_ste._ here, kiss the [[book]]. though thou canst swim
like a duck, thou art [[arts]] made like a goose.

_trin._ o stephano, hast any more of this?

_ste._ the whole butt, [[man]]: my cellar is in a rock by
the sea-side, where my wine is hid. how now, moon-calf!            125
how does thine ague?

_cal._ hast thou not dropp’d from [[heaven]]?

_ste._ out o’ the moon, i do assure thee: i was the man
i’ the moon when [[time]] was.

_cal._ i have seen thee in her, and i do adore thee:               130
my mistress show’d me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush.

_ste._ come, swear to that; kiss the [[book]]: i will furnish
it anon with new contents: swear.

_trin._ by this [[good]] [[light]], this is a very shallow monster!
i afeard of him! a very [[weak]] monster! the                          135
man i’ the moon! a most [[poor]] credulous monster! well
drawn, monster, in [[good]] sooth!

_cal._ i’ll show thee every fertile inch o’ th’ island;
and i will kiss thy foot: i prithee, be my [[god]].

_trin._ by this [[light]], a most perfidious and drunken               140
monster! when’s [[god’s]] asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.

_cal._ i’ll kiss thy foot; i’ll swear myself thy [[subject]].

_ste._ come on, then; down, and swear.

_trin._ i shall laugh myself to [[death]] at this puppy-headed
monster. a most scurvy monster! i could find in                    145
my [[heart]] to beat him,--

_ste._ come, kiss.

_trin._ but that the [[poor]] monster’s in drink: an abominable
monster!

_cal._ i’ll show thee the [[best]] springs; i’ll pluck thee berries;   150
i’ll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.
a plague upon the [[tyrant]] that i serve!
i’ll bear him no more sticks, but [[follow]] thee,
thou wondrous [[man]].

_trin._ a most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder                155
of a [[poor]] drunkard!

_cal._ i prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
and i with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;
show thee a jay’s nest, and instruct thee how
to snare the nimble marmoset; i’ll bring thee                      160
to clustering filberts, and sometimes i’ll get thee
young scamels from the rock. wilt thou go with me?

_ste._ i prithee now, lead the way, without any more
talking. trinculo, the [[king]] and all our company else being
drowned, we will inherit here: here; bear my bottle: fellow        165
trinculo, we’ll fill him by and by again.

_cal. sings drunkenly._] farewell, master; farewell, farewell!

_trin._ a howling monster; a drunken monster!

_cal._ no more dams i’ll make for fish;
                nor fetch in firing                                170
                at requiring;
             nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish:
                ’ban, ’ban, cacaliban
                has a new master:--get a new [[man]].

freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! [[freedom]], hey-day,              175
freedom!

_ste._ o brave monster! lead the way.    [_exeunt._

scene i. _before prospero’s cell._

  _enter ferdinand, bearing a log._

_fer._ there be some sports [[sport]] are painful, and their labour
delight in them sets off: some kinds [[kind]] of baseness
are nobly undergone, and most [[poor]] matters
point to [[rich]] ends. this my mean task
would be as heavy to me as odious, but                               5
the mistress which i serve quickens what’s [[dead]],
and makes my labours [[labour]] pleasures [[pleasure]]: o, she is
ten times [[time]] more gentle than her father’s crabbed.
and he’s composed of harshness. i must remove
some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,                     10
upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
weeps when she sees me [[work]], and says, such baseness
had never like executor. i forget:
but these sweet thoughts [[thought]] do even refresh my labours [[labour]],
most busy lest, when i do it.

  _enter miranda; and prospero at a distance, unseen._

_mir._                  alas, now, [[pray]] you,                        15
work not so hard: i would the lightning had
burnt up those logs that you are enjoin’d to pile!
pray, set it down, and rest you: when this burns,
’twill weep for having wearied you. my father
is hard at study; [[pray]], now, rest yourself;                         20
he’s safe for these three hours.

_fer._                         o most dear mistress,
the sun will set before i shall discharge
what i must strive to do.

_mir._                  if you’ll sit down,
i’ll bear your logs the while: [[pray]], give me that;
i’ll carry it to the pile.

_fer._                   no, precious creature;                     25
i had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
than you should such dishonour undergo,
while i sit lazy by.

_mir._             it would become me
as well as it does you: and i should do it
with much more ease; for my [[good]] will is to it,                     30
and yours it is against.

_pros._                [[poor]] worm, thou art [[arts]] infected!
this visitation shows it.

_mir._                  you look wearily.

_fer._ no, [[noble]] mistress; ’tis fresh morning with me
when you are by at night. i do beseech you,--
chiefly that i might set it in my prayers,--                        35
what is your name?

_mir._           miranda. --o my [[father]],
i have broke your hest to say so!

_fer._                          admired miranda!
indeed the top of admiration! worth
what’s dearest to the world! full many a lady
i have eyed with [[best]] regard, and many a [[time]]                       40
the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
have i liked several [[women]]; never any
with so full [[soul]], but some defect in her
did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,                        45
and put it to the foil: but you, o you,
so [[perfect]] and so peerless, are created
of every creature’s best!

_mir._             i do not know
one of my [[sex]]; no woman’s face [[remember]],
save, from my glass, mine own; nor have i seen                      50
more that i may call [[men]] than you, [[good]] friend,
and my dear [[father]]: how features are abroad,
i am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
the jewel in my dower, i would not wish
any companion in the [[world]] but you;                                 55
nor can [[imagination]] form a shape,
besides yourself, to like of. but i prattle
something too wildly, and my father’s precepts
i therein do forget.

_fer._             i am, in my condition,
a [[prince]], miranda; i do [[think]], a [[king]];                              60
i would, not so!--and would no more endure
this wooden [[slavery]] than to suffer
the flesh-fly blow my mouth. hear my [[soul]] speak:
the very instant that i saw you, did
my [[heart]] fly to your service; there resides,                        65
to make me [[slave]] to it; and for your sake
am i this patient log-man.

_mir._                   do you [[love]] me?

_fer._ o [[heaven]], o [[earth]], bear witness to this sound,
and [[crown]] what i profess with [[kind]] event,
if i speak true! if hollowly, invert                                70
what [[best]] is boded me to mischief! i,
beyond all limit of what else i’ the [[world]],
do [[love]], prize, [[honour]] you.

_mir._                    i am a fool
to weep at what i am glad of.

_pros._                     [[fair]] encounter
of two most rare affections! heavens [[heaven]] rain grace                     75
on that which breeds between ’em!

_fer._                          wherefore weep you?

_mir._ at mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
what i [[desire]] to give; and much less take
what i shall [[die]] to want. but this is trifling;
and all the more it seeks to hide itself,                           80
the bigger bulk it shows. hence, bashful cunning!
and prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
i am your [[wife]], if you will [[marry]] me;
if not, i’ll [[die]] your maid: to be your fellow
you may deny me; but i’ll be your servant,                          85
whether you will or no.

_fer._                my mistress, dearest;
and i thus humble ever.

_mir._                my husband, then?

_fer._ ay, with a [[heart]] as willing
as bondage e’er of [[freedom]]: here’s my hand.

_mir._ and mine, with my [[heart]] in’t: and now farewell               90
till half an hour hence.

_fer._                 a thousand thousand!

    [_exeunt fer. and mir. severally._

_pros._ so glad of this as they i cannot be,
who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
at nothing can be more. i’ll to my [[book]];
for yet, ere supper-time, must i perform                            95
much [[business]] appertaining.    [_exit._

scene ii. _another part of the island._

  _enter caliban, stephano, and trinculo._

_ste._ tell not me;--when the butt is out, we will drink
water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and board ’em.
servant-monster, drink to me.

_trin._ servant-monster! the folly of this island! they
say there’s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if        5
th’ other two be brained like us, the [[state]] totters.

_ste._ drink, servant-monster, when i bid thee: thy eyes
are almost set in thy head.

_trin._ where should they be set else? he were a brave
monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.                       10

_ste._ my man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack:
for my part, the sea cannot drown me; i swam, ere i could
recover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on. by
this [[light]], thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my
standard.                                                           15

_trin._ your lieutenant, if you list; he’s no standard.

_ste._ we’ll not run, monsieur monster.

_trin._ nor go neither; but you’ll [[lie]], like dogs, and
yet say nothing neither.

_ste._ moon-calf, speak once in thy [[life]], if thou beest a           20
good moon-calf.

_cal._ how does thy [[honour]]? let me lick thy shoe.
i’ll not serve him, he is not valiant.

_trin._ thou liest, most ignorant monster: i am in case
to justle a constable. why, thou debauched fish, thou, was          25
there ever [[man]] a [[coward]] that hath drunk so much sack as
i to-day? wilt thou tell a monstrous [[lie]], being but half a
fish and half a monster?

_cal._ lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my [[lord]]?

_trin._ ‘lord,’ quoth he! that a monster should be                  30
such a natural!

_cal._ lo, lo, again! bite him to [[death]], i prithee.

_ste._ trinculo, keep a [[good]] tongue in your head: if you
prove a mutineer,--the next tree! the [[poor]] monster’s my
subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.                         35

_cal._ i thank my [[noble]] [[lord]]. wilt thou be pleased to
hearken once again to the suit i made to thee?

_ste._ [[marry]], will i: kneel and repeat it; i will stand,
and so shall trinculo.

  _enter ariel, invisible._

_cal._ as i told thee before, i am [[subject]] to a [[tyrant]], a           40
sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.

_ari._ thou liest.

_cal._           thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou:
i would my valiant master would [[destroy]] thee!
i do not [[lie]].

_ste._ trinculo, if you trouble him any more in’s tale, by          45
this hand, i will supplant some of your teeth.

_trin._ why, i said nothing.

_ste._ mum, then, and no more. proceed.

_cal._ i say, by sorcery he got this isle;
from me he got it. if thy greatness will                            50
revenge it on him,--for i [[know]] thou darest,
but this thing dare not,--

_ste._ that’s most [[certain]].

_cal._ thou shalt be [[lord]] of it, and i’ll serve thee.

_ste._ how now shall this be compassed? canst thou                  55
bring me to the party?

_cal._ yea, yea, my [[lord]]: i’ll yield him thee asleep,
where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.

_ari._ thou liest; thou canst not.

_cal._ what a pied ninny’s this! thou scurvy patch!                 60
i do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,
and take his bottle from him: when that’s gone,
he shall drink nought but brine; for i’ll not show him
where the quick freshes are.

_ste._ trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the          65
monster one word further, and, by this hand, i’ll turn my
mercy out o’ doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.

_trin._ why, what did i? i did nothing. i’ll go farther
off.

_ste._ didst thou not say he lied?                                  70

_ari._ thou liest.

_ste._ do i so? take thou that. [_beats him._] as you
like this, give me the [[lie]] another [[time]].

_trin._ i did not give the [[lie]]. out o’ your wits, and
hearing too? a pox o’ your bottle! this can sack and                75
drinking do. a murrain on your monster, and the devil
take your fingers!

_cal._ ha, ha, ha!

_ste._ now, forward with your tale. --prithee, stand farther
off.                                                                80

_cal._ beat him enough: after a little [[time]],
i’ll beat him too.

_ste._ stand farther. come, proceed.

_cal._ why, as i told thee, ’tis a custom with him
i’ th’ afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
having first seized his books [[book]]; or with a log                        85
batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
or cut his wezand with thy knife. remember
first to possess his books [[book]]; for without them
he’s but a sot, as i am, nor hath not
one spirit to command: they all do hate him                         90
as rootedly as i. burn but his books [[book]].
he has brave utensils,--for so he calls them,--
which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.
and that most deeply to consider is
the [[beauty]] of his [[daughter]]; he himself                              95
calls her a nonpareil: i never saw a woman,
but only sycorax my dam and she;
but she as far surpasseth sycorax
as great’st does least.

_ste._                is it so brave a lass?

_cal._ ay, [[lord]]; she will become thy bed, i warrant,               100
and bring thee forth brave brood.

_ste._ monster, i will kill this [[man]]: his [[daughter]] and i
will be [[king]] and queen,--save our graces!--and trinculo
and thyself shall be viceroys. dost thou like the plot,
trinculo?                                                          105

_trin._ excellent.

_ste._ give me thy hand: i am [[sorry]] i beat thee; but,
while thou livest, keep a [[good]] tongue in thy head.

_cal._ within this half hour will he be asleep:
wilt thou [[destroy]] him then?

_ste._                    ay, on mine [[honour]].                      110

_ari._ this will i tell my master.

_cal._ thou makest me merry; i am full of [[pleasure]]:
let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
you taught me but while-ere?

_ste._ at thy request, monster, i will do [[reason]], any              115
reason. --come on. trinculo, let us sing.      [_sings._

  flout ’em and scout ’em, and scout ’em and flout ’em;
  [[thought]] is [[free]].

_cal._ that’s not the tune.

  [_ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe._

_ste._ what is this same?                                          120

_trin._ this is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
of nobody.

_ste._ if thou beest a [[man]], show thyself in thy likeness:
if thou beest a [[devil]], take’t as thou list.

_trin._ o, [[forgive]] me my sins!                                     125

_ste._ he that dies pays [[pay]] all debts: i defy thee. mercy
upon us!

_cal._ art [[arts]] thou afeard?

_ste._ no, monster, not i.

_cal._ be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,                  130
sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
that, if i then had waked after long sleep,
will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,                   135
the clouds methought would open, and show riches
ready to drop upon me; that, when i waked,
i cried to [[dream]] again.

_ste._ this will prove a brave [[kingdom]] to me, where i
shall have my [[music]] for nothing.                                   140

_cal._ when prospero is destroyed.

_ste._ that shall be by and by: i [[remember]] the story.

_trin._ the sound is going away; let’s [[follow]] it, and
after do our [[work]].

_ste._ lead, monster; we’ll [[follow]]. i would i could see            145
this taborer; he lays it on.

_trin._ wilt come? i’ll [[follow]], stephano.    [_exeunt._

scene iii. _another part of the island._

  _enter alonso, sebastian, antonio, gonzalo, adrian, francisco,
  and others._

_gon._ by’r lakin, i can go no further, sir;
my old bones ache: here’s a maze trod, indeed,
through forth-rights and meanders! by your patience,
i needs must rest me.

_alon._             old [[lord]], i cannot blame thee,
who am myself attach’d with weariness,                               5
to the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
even here i will put off my [[hope]], and keep it
no longer for my flatterer: he is drown’d
whom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks
our frustrate search on [[land]]. well, let him go.                     10

_ant._ [_aside to seb._] i am [[right]] glad that he’s so out of [[hope]].
do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
that you resolved to effect.

_seb._ [_aside to ant._] the next advantage
will we take throughly.

_ant._ [_aside to seb._] let it be to-night;
for, now they are oppress’d with travel, they                       15
will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
as when they are fresh.

_seb._ [_aside to ant._] i say, to-night: no more.

  [_solemn and [[strange]] [[music]]._

_alon._ what harmony is this?--my [[good]] [[friends]], hark!

_gon._ marvellous sweet music!

  _enter prospero above, invisible. enter several [[strange]] shapes,
  bringing in a banquet: they dance about it with gentle actions of
  salutation; and, inviting the [[king]], &c. to [[eat]], they depart._

_alon._ give us [[kind]] keepers, heavens!--what were these?            20

_seb._ a living drollery. now i will believe
that there are unicorns; that in arabia
there is one tree, the phœnix’ [[throne]]; one phœnix
at this hour reigning there.

_ant._                     i’ll [[believe]] both;
and what does else want credit, come to me,                         25
and i’ll be sworn ’tis true: travellers ne’er did [[lie]],
though fools [[fool]] at [[home]] condemn ’em.

_gon._                          if in naples
i should report this now, would they [[believe]] me?
if i should say, i saw such islanders,--
for, certes, these are [[people]] of the island,--                      30
who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
their manners are more gentle-kind than of
our [[human]] [[generation]] you shall find
many, nay, almost any.

_pros._              [_aside_] honest [[lord]],
thou hast said well; for some of you there [[present]]                  35
are worse than devils [[devil]].

_alon._              i cannot too much muse
such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing--
although they want the use of tongue--a kind
of excellent dumb discourse.

_pros._                    [_aside_] [[praise]] in departing.

_fran._ they vanish’d strangely.

_seb._                         no matter, since                     40
they have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.--
will’t please you taste of what is here?

_alon._                                not i.

_gon._ [[faith]], sir, you need not [[fear]]. when we were boys,
who would [[believe]] that there were mountaineers
dew-lapp’d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em             45
wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
each putter-out of five for one will bring us
good warrant of.

_alon._        i will stand to, and feed,
although my [[last]]: no matter, since i [[feel]]                           50
the [[best]] is [[past]]. [[brother]], my [[lord]] the duke,
stand to, and do as we.

  _thunder and lightning. enter ariel, like a harpy; claps his
  wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet
  vanishes._

_ari._ you are three [[men]] of [[sin]], whom [[destiny]],--
that hath to instrument this lower world
and what is in’t,--the never-surfeited sea                          55
hath caused to belch up you; and on this island,
where [[man]] doth not inhabit,--you ’mongst men
being most unfit to [[live]]. i have made you mad;
and even with such-like valour [[men]] hang and drown
their proper selves.    [_alon., seb. &c. draw their swords [[sword]]._
                   you fools! i and my fellows                      60
are ministers of [[fate]]: the elements,
of whom your swords [[sword]] are temper’d, may as well
wound the loud winds, or with bemock’d-at stabs
kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
one dowle that’s in my plume: my fellow-ministers                   65
are like invulnerable. if you could hurt,
your swords [[sword]] are now too massy for your strengths,
and will not be uplifted. but [[remember]],--
for that’s my [[business]] to you,--that you three
from milan did supplant [[good]] prospero;                              70
exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
him and his [[innocent]] child: for which foul deed
the powers [[power]], delaying, not forgetting, have
incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
against your [[peace]]. thee of thy [[son]], alonso,                        75
they have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
lingering perdition--worse than any death
can be at once--shall step by step attend
you and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from,--
which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls                  80
upon your heads,--is nothing but heart-sorrow
and a clear [[life]] ensuing.

  _he vanishes in thunder; then, to soft [[music]], enter the shapes
  again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the
  table._

_pros._ bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
perform’d, my ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
of my instruction hast thou nothing bated                           85
in what thou hadst to say: so, with [[good]] life
and observation [[strange]], my meaner ministers
their several kinds [[kind]] have done. my high charms [[work]],
and these mine enemies [[enemy]] are all knit up
in their distractions: they now are in my [[power]];                    90
and in these fits i leave them, while i visit
young ferdinand,--whom they suppose is drown’d,--
and his and mine loved darling.    [_exit above._

_gon._ i’ the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
in this [[strange]] stare?

_alon._              o, it is monstrous, monstrous!                 95
methought the billows spoke, and told me of it;
the winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,
that deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
the name of [[prosper]]: it did bass my trespass.
therefore my [[son]] i’ th’ ooze is bedded; and                        100
i’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded,
and with him there [[lie]] mudded.    [_exit._

_seb._                       but one fiend at a [[time]],
i’ll [[fight]] their legions o’er.

_ant._                       i’ll be thy second.

    [_exeunt seb. and ant._

_gon._ all three of them are desperate: their [[great]] guilt,
like poison given to [[work]] a [[great]] [[time]] after,                      105
now ’gins to bite the spirits. i do beseech you,
that are of suppler joints, [[follow]] them swiftly,
and hinder them from what this ecstasy
may now provoke them to.

_adr._                 [[follow]], i [[pray]] you.    [_exeunt._

act iv.


scene i. _before prospero’s cell._

  _enter prospero, ferdinand, and miranda._

_pros._ if i have too austerely punish’d you,
your compensation makes amends; for i
have given you here a third of mine own [[life]],
or that for which i [[live]]; who once again
i tender to thy hand: all thy vexations                              5
were but my trials of thy [[love]], and thou
hast strangely stood the test: here, afore [[heaven]],
i ratify this my [[rich]] gift. o ferdinand,
do not smile at me that i boast her off,
for thou shalt find she will outstrip all [[praise]],                   10
and make it halt behind her.

_fer._                     i do [[believe]] it
against an oracle.

_pros._          then, as my gift, and thine own acquisition
worthily purchased, take my [[daughter]]: but
if thou dost break her virgin-knot before                           15
all sanctimonious ceremonies [[ceremony]] may
with full and holy rite be minister’d,
no sweet aspersion shall the heavens [[heaven]] let fall
to make this contract grow; but barren hate,
sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew                         20
the union of your bed with weeds so loathly
that you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
as hymen’s lamps shall [[light]] you.

_fer._                          as i hope
for quiet days, [[fair]] issue and long [[life]],
with such [[love]] as ’tis now, the murkiest den,                       25
the most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion
our worser genius can, shall never melt
mine [[honour]] into [[lust]], to take away
the edge of that day’s celebration
when i shall [[think]], or phœbus’ steeds are founder’d,                30
or night kept chain’d below.

_pros._                    fairly spoke.
sit, then, and talk with her; she is thine own.
what, ariel! my industrious servant, ariel!

  _enter ariel._

_ari._ what would my potent master? here i am.

_pros._ thou and thy meaner fellows your [[last]] service               35
did worthily perform; and i must use you
in such another trick. go bring the rabble,
o’er whom i give thee [[power]], here to this place:
incite them to quick motion; for i must
bestow upon the [[eyes]] of this [[young]] couple                           40
some vanity of mine art [[arts]]: it is my promise,
and they expect it from me.

_ari._                    presently?

_pros._ ay, with a twink.

_ari._ before you can say, ‘come,’ and ‘go,’
            and breathe twice, and cry, ‘so, so,’                   45
            each one, tripping on his toe,
            will be here with mop and mow.
            do you [[love]] me, master? no?

_pros._ dearly, my delicate ariel. do not approach
till thou dost hear me call.

_ari._                     well, i conceive.    [_exit._            50

_pros._ look thou be true; do not give dalliance
too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
to the [[fire]] i’ the [[blood]]: be more abstemious,
or else, [[good]] night your vow!

_fer._                      i warrant you, sir;
the [[white]] cold virgin snow upon my [[heart]]                            55
abates the ardour of my liver.

_pros._                      well.
now come, my ariel! bring a corollary,
rather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly!
no tongue! all eyes! be silent.                  [_soft [[music]]._

    _enter iris._

  _iris._ ceres, most bounteous [[lady]], thy [[rich]] leas                 60
    of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and pease;
    thy turfy mountains, where [[live]] nibbling sheep,
    and flat meads thatch’d with stover, them to keep;
    thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
    which spongy april at thy [[best]] betrims,                         65
    to make cold nymphs [[nymph]] chaste crowns [[crown]]; and thy broom-groves,
    whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves [[love]],
    being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;
    and thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
    where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o’ the [[sky]],             70
    whose watery arch and messenger am i,
    bids thee leave these; and with her [[sovereign]] grace,
    here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
    to come and [[sport]]:--her peacocks fly amain:
    approach, [[rich]] ceres, her to entertain.                         75

    _enter ceres._

  _cer._ hail, many-colour’d messenger, that ne’er
    dost disobey the [[wife]] of [[jupiter]];
    who, with thy saffron wings, upon my flowers
    diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers;
    and with each end of thy blue bow dost [[crown]]                    80
    my bosky acres and my unshrubb’d down,
    [[rich]] scarf to my proud [[earth]];--why hath thy queen
    summon’d me hither, to this short-grass’d green?

  _iris._ a contract of true [[love]] to celebrate;
    and some donation freely to estate                              85
    on the blest lovers.

  _cer._             tell me, heavenly bow,
    if [[venus]] or her [[son]], as thou dost [[know]],
    do now attend the queen? since they did plot
    the means that dusky dis my [[daughter]] got,
    her and her blind boy’s scandal’d company                       90
    i have forsworn.

  _iris._        of her society
    be not afraid: i met her deity
    cutting the clouds towards paphos, and her son
    dove-drawn with her. here [[thought]] they to have done
    some wanton charm upon this [[man]] and maid,                       95
    whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
    till hymen’s torch be lighted: but in [[vain]];
    mars’s hot minion is returned again;
    her waspish-headed [[son]] has broke his arrows,
    swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,          100
    and be a boy [[right]] out.

  _cer._                high’st queen of [[state]],
    [[great]] juno, comes; i [[know]] her by her gait.

    _enter juno._

  _juno._ how does my bounteous sister? go with me
    to bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,
    and honour’d in their issue.         [_they sing:_             105

  _juno._ [[honour]], riches [[rich]], marriage-blessing,
            long continuance, and increasing,
            hourly joys be still upon you!
            juno sings her blessings on you.

  _cer._  earth’s increase, foison plenty,                         110
            barns and garners never empty;
            vines with clustering bunches growing;
            plants with goodly burthen bowing;
            spring come to you at the farthest
            in the very end of harvest!                            115
            scarcity and want shall shun you;
            ceres’ blessing so is on you.

_fer._ this is a most majestic vision, and
harmonious charmingly. may i be bold
to [[think]] these spirits?

_pros._               spirits, which by mine art [[arts]]                   120
i have from their confines call’d to enact
my [[present]] fancies.

_fer._            let me [[live]] here ever;
so rare a wonder’d [[father]] and a wife
makes this place paradise.

    [_juno and ceres whisper, and send iris on employment._

_pros._                  sweet, now, silence!
juno and ceres whisper seriously;                                  125
there’s something else to do: hush, and be mute,
or else our spell is marr’d.

  _iris._ you nymphs [[nymph]], call’d naiads, of the windring brooks,
            with your sedged crowns [[crown]] and ever-harmless looks,
            leave your crisp channels, and on this green [[land]]      130
            [[answer]] your summons; juno does command:
            come, temperate nymphs [[nymph]], and [[help]] to celebrate
            a contract of true [[love]]; be not too late.

    _enter [[certain]] nymphs [[nymph]]._

            you sunburnt sicklemen, of august weary,
            come hither from the furrow, and be merry:             135
            make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on,
            and these fresh nymphs [[nymph]] encounter every one
            in [[country]] footing.

    _enter [[certain]] reapers, properly habited: they join with the
    nymphs [[nymph]] in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof prospero
    starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a [[strange]], hollow,
    and confused noise, they heavily vanish._

_pros._ [_aside_] i had forgot that foul conspiracy
of the beast caliban and his confederates                          140
against my [[life]]: the minute of their plot
is almost come. [_to the spirits._] well done! avoid; no more!

_fer._ this is [[strange]]: your father’s in some passion
that works [[work]] him strongly.

_mir._                 never till this day
saw i him touch’d with anger so distemper’d.                       145

_pros._ you do look, my [[son]], in a moved sort,
as if you were dismay’d: be cheerful, sir.
our revels now are ended. these our actors,
as i foretold you, were all spirits, and
are melted into air, into thin air:                                150
and, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
the cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces,
the solemn temples, the [[great]] globe itself,
yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
and, like this insubstantial pageant faded,                        155
leave not a rack behind. we are such stuff
as dreams [[dream]] are made on; and our little life
is rounded with a sleep. sir, i am vex’d;
bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:
be not disturb’d with my infirmity:                                160
if you be pleased, retire into my cell,
and there repose: a turn or two i’ll walk,
to still my beating [[mind]].

_fer._ _mir._           we [[wish]] your [[peace]].    [_exeunt._

_pros._ come with a [[thought]]. i thank thee, ariel: come.

  _enter ariel._

_ari._ thy thoughts [[thought]] i cleave to. what’s thy [[pleasure]]?              165

_pros._                                             spirit,
we must prepare to meet with caliban.

_ari._ ay, my commander: when i presented ceres,
i [[thought]] to have told thee of it; but i fear’d
lest i might anger thee.

_pros._ say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?           170

_ari._ i told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
so full of valour that they smote the air
for breathing in their faces; beat the ground
for kissing of their feet; yet always bending
towards their project. then i beat my tabor;                       175
at which, like unback’d colts, they prick’d their ears,
advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
as they smelt [[music]]: so i charm’d their ears,
that, calf-like, they my lowing follow’d through
tooth’d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,           180
which enter’d their frail shins: at [[last]] i left them
i’ the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
there dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
o’erstunk their feet.

_pros._             this was well done, my bird.
thy shape invisible retain thou still:                             185
the trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
for stale to catch these thieves.

_ari._                          i go, i go.    [_exit._

_pros._ a [[devil]], a born [[devil]], on whose nature
nurture can never stick; on whom my pains [[pain]],
humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;                         190
and as with [[age]] his [[body]] uglier grows,
so his [[mind]] cankers. i will plague them all,
even to roaring.

  _re-enter ariel, loaden with glistering apparel, &c._

come, hang them on this line.

  _prospero and ariel remain, invisible. enter caliban, stephano,
  and trinculo, all wet._

_cal._ [[pray]] you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.                        195

_ste._ monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless
fairy, has done little [[better]] than played the jack with us.

_trin._ monster, i do smell all horse-piss; at which my
nose is in [[great]] indignation.

_ste._ so is mine. do you hear, monster? if i should               200
take a displeasure against you, look you,--

_trin._ thou wert but a lost monster.

_cal._ [[good]] my [[lord]], give me thy favour still.
be patient, for the prize i’ll bring thee to
shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.             205
all’s hush’d as midnight yet.

_trin._ ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--

_ste._ there is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
monster, but an infinite loss.

_trin._ that’s more to me than my wetting: yet this is             210
your harmless fairy, monster.

_ste._ i will fetch off my bottle, though i be o’er ears for
my [[labour]].

_cal._ prithee, my [[king]], be quiet. see’st thou here,
this is the mouth o’ the cell: no noise, and enter.                215
do that [[good]] mischief which may make this island
thine own for ever, and i, thy caliban,
for aye thy foot-licker.

_ste._ give me thy hand. i do begin to have bloody
thoughts.                                                          220

_trin._ o [[king]] stephano! o peer! o worthy stephano!
look what a wardrobe here is for thee!

_cal._ let it alone, thou [[fool]]; it is but trash.

_trin._ o, ho, monster! we [[know]] what belongs to a frippery.
o [[king]] stephano!                                                   225

_ste._ put off that gown, trinculo; by this hand, i’ll
have that gown.

_trin._ thy grace shall have it.

_cal._ the dropsy drown this fool! what do you mean
to dote thus on such luggage? let’s alone,                         230
and do the murder first: if he awake,
from toe to [[crown]] he’ll fill our skins with pinches,
make us [[strange]] stuff.

_ste._ be you quiet, monster. mistress line, is not this
my jerkin? now is the jerkin under the line: now, jerkin,          235
you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.

_trin._ do, do: we steal by line and level, an’t like your
grace.

_ste._ i thank thee for that jest; here’s a garment for’t:
wit shall not go unrewarded while i am [[king]] of this [[country]].       240
‘steal by line and level’ is an excellent pass of pate;
there’s another garment for’t.

_trin._ monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,
and away with the rest.

_cal._ i will have none on’t: we shall lose our [[time]],              245
and all be turn’d to barnacles, or to apes
with foreheads villanous low.

_ste._ monster, lay-to your fingers: [[help]] to bear this
away where my hogshead of wine is, or i’ll turn you out
of my [[kingdom]]: go to, carry this.                                  250

_trin._ and this.

_ste._ ay, and this.

  _a noise of hunters heard. enter divers spirits, in shape of
  dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, prospero and ariel setting
  them on._

_pros._ hey, mountain, hey!

_ari._ silver! there it goes, silver!

_pros._ fury, fury! there, [[tyrant]], there! hark, hark!              255
                        [_cal., ste., and trin. are driven out._

go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
with dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews
with aged cramps; and more pinch-spotted make them
then pard or cat o’ mountain.

_ari._                      hark, they roar!

_pros._ let them be hunted soundly. at this hour                   260
lie at my [[mercy]] all mine enemies [[enemy]]:
shortly shall all my labours [[labour]] end, and thou
shalt have the air at [[freedom]]: for a little
follow, and do me service.    [_exeunt._

act v.


scene i. _before the cell of prospero._

  _enter prospero in his magic robes, and ariel._

_pros._ now does my project gather to a head:
my charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
goes upright with his carriage. how’s the day?

_ari._ on the sixth hour; at which [[time]], my [[lord]],
you said our [[work]] should cease.

_pros._                       i did say so,                          5
when first i raised the tempest. say, my spirit,
how fares the [[king]] and’s followers?

_ari._                            confined together
in the same [[fashion]] as you gave in charge,
just as you left them; all prisoners [[prisoner]], sir,
in the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;                    10
they cannot budge till your release. the [[king]],
his [[brother]], and yours, abide all three distracted,
and the remainder mourning over them,
brimful of [[sorrow]] and dismay; but chiefly
him that you term’d, sir, “the [[good]] old [[lord]], gonzalo;”             15
his tears run down his beard, like winter’s drops
from eaves of reeds. your charm so strongly works [[work]] ’em,
that if you now beheld them, your affections
would become tender.

_pros._            dost thou [[think]] so, spirit?

_ari._ mine would, sir, were i [[human]].

_pros._                             and mine shall.                 20
hast thou, which art [[arts]] but air, a touch, a feeling
of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
one of their [[kind]], that relish all as sharply,
passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art [[arts]]?
though with their high wrongs [[wrong]] i am struck to the quick,             25
yet with my nobler [[reason]] ’gainst my fury
do i take part: the rarer action is
in [[virtue]] than in vengeance: they being penitent,
the sole drift of my [[purpose]] doth extend
not a frown further. go release them, ariel:                        30
my charms i’ll break, their senses i’ll restore,
and they shall be themselves.

_ari._                      i’ll fetch them, sir.    [_exit._

_pros._ ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves;
and ye that on the sands with printless foot
do chase the ebbing [[neptune]], and do fly him                         35
when he comes back; you demi-puppets that
by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
to hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid--                           40
weak masters though ye be--i have bedimm’d
the noontide sun, call’d forth the mutinous winds.
and ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault
set roaring [[war]]: to the dread rattling thunder
have i given [[fire]], and rifted jove’s stout oak                      45
with his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
have i made shake, and by the spurs pluck’d up
the pine and cedar: graves at my command
have waked their sleepers, oped, and let ’em forth
by my so potent art [[arts]]. but this rough magic                           50
i here abjure; and, when i have required
some heavenly [[music]],--which even now i do,--
to [[work]] mine end upon their senses, that
this airy charm is for, i’ll break my staff,
bury it [[certain]] fathoms in the [[earth]],                               55
and deeper than did ever plummet sound
i’ll drown my [[book]].                    [_solemn [[music]]._

  _re-enter ariel before: then alonso, with a frantic gesture,
  attended by gonzalo; sebastian and antonio in like manner,
  attended by adrian and francisco: they all enter the circle
  which prospero had made, and there stand charmed; which prospero
  observing, speaks:_

a solemn air, and the [[best]] comforter
to an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
now useless, boil’d within thy skull! there stand,                  60
for you are spell-stopp’d.
holy gonzalo, honourable [[man]],
mine [[eyes]], even sociable to the show of thine,
fall fellowly drops. the charm dissolves apace;
and as the morning steals upon the night,                           65
melting the darkness, so their rising senses
begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
their clearer [[reason]]. o [[good]] gonzalo,
my true preserver, and a [[loyal]] sir
to him thou follow’st! i will [[pay]] thy graces                        70
home both in word and deed. most cruelly
didst thou, alonso, use me and my [[daughter]]:
thy [[brother]] was a furtherer in the act.
thou art [[arts]] pinch’d for’t now, sebastian. flesh and [[blood]],
you, [[brother]] mine, that entertain’d [[ambition]],                       75
expell’d remorse and [[nature]]; who, with sebastian,--
whose inward pinches therefore are most [[strong]],--
would here have kill’d your [[king]]; i do [[forgive]] thee,
unnatural though thou art [[arts]]. their understanding
begins to swell; and the approaching tide                           80
will shortly fill the reasonable shore,
that now lies [[lie]] foul and muddy. not one of them
that yet looks on me, or would [[know]] me: ariel,
fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
i will discase me, and myself [[present]]                               85
as i was sometime milan: quickly, spirit;
thou shalt ere long be [[free]].

_ariel sings and helps to attire him._

    where the bee sucks, there suck i:
    in a cowslip’s bell i [[lie]];
    there i couch when owls do cry.                                 90
    on the bat’s back i do fly
    after summer merrily.
merrily, merrily shall i [[live]] now
under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

_pros._ why, that’s my dainty ariel! i shall miss thee;             95
but yet thou shalt have [[freedom]]: so, so, so.
to the king’s ship, invisible as thou art [[arts]]:
there shalt thou find the mariners asleep
under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
being awake, enforce them to this place,                           100
and presently, i prithee.

_ari._ i drink the air before me, and return
or ere your pulse twice beat.    [_exit._

_gon._ all torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
inhabits here: some heavenly [[power]] guide us                        105
out of this fearful country!

_pros._                    behold, sir [[king]],
the wronged duke of milan, prospero:
for more assurance that a living prince
does now speak to thee, i embrace thy [[body]];
and to thee and thy company i bid                                  110
a hearty welcome.

_alon._         whether thou be’st he or no,
or some enchanted trifle to [[abuse]] me,
as late i have been, i not [[know]]: thy pulse
beats, as of flesh and [[blood]]; and, since i saw thee,
the affliction of my [[mind]] amends, with which,                      115
i [[fear]], a madness held me: this must crave--
an if this be at all--a most [[strange]] story.
thy dukedom i resign, and do entreat
thou pardon me my wrongs [[wrong]]. --but how should prospero
be living and be here?

_pros._              first, [[noble]] friend,                          120
let me embrace thine [[age]], whose [[honour]] cannot
be measured or confined.

_gon._                 whether this be
or be not, i’ll not swear.

_pros._                  you do yet taste
some subtilties o’ the isle, that will not let you
believe things [[certain]]. welcome, my [[friends]] all!                   125
[_aside to seb. and ant._]
    but you, my brace of lords [[lord]], were i so minded,
i here could pluck his highness’ frown upon you,
and justify you traitors: at this time
i will tell no tales.

_seb._ [_aside_]    the [[devil]] speaks in him.

_pros._                                    no.
for you, most wicked sir, whom to call [[brother]]                     130
would even infect my mouth, i do forgive
thy rankest [[fault]],--all of them; and require
my dukedom of thee, which perforce, i [[know]],
thou must restore.

_alon._          if thou be’st prospero,
give us particulars of thy preservation;                           135
how thou hast met us here, who three hours since
were wreck’d upon this shore; where i have lost--
how sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
my dear [[son]] ferdinand.

_pros._              i am woe for’t, sir.

_alon._ irreparable is the loss; and patience                      140
says it is [[past]] her cure.

_pros._                 i rather think
you have not sought her [[help]], of whose soft grace
for the like loss i have her [[sovereign]] aid,
and rest myself content.

_alon._                you the like loss!

_pros._ as [[great]] to me as late; and, supportable                   145
to make the dear loss, have i means much weaker
than you may call to comfort you, for i
have lost my [[daughter]].

_alon._              a [[daughter]]?
o heavens [[heaven]], that they were living both in naples,
the [[king]] and queen there! that they were, i [[wish]]                   150
myself were mudded in that oozy bed
where my [[son]] lies [[lie]]. when did you lose you [[daughter]]?

_pros._ in this [[last]] tempest. i perceive, these lords
at this encounter do so much [[admire]],
that they devour their [[reason]], and scarce [[think]]                    155
their [[eyes]] do offices of [[truth]], their words
are [[natural]] breath: but, howsoe’er you have
been justled from your senses, [[know]] for certain
that i am prospero, and that very duke
which was thrust forth of milan; who most strangely                160
upon this shore, where you were wreck’d, was landed,
to be the [[lord]] on’t. no more yet of this;
for ’tis a chronicle of day by day,
not a relation for a breakfast, nor
befitting this first meeting. welcome, sir;                        165
this cell’s my court: here have i few attendants,
and subjects [[subject]] none abroad: [[pray]] you, look in.
my dukedom since you have given me again,
i will requite you with as [[good]] a thing;
at least bring forth a wonder, to content ye                       170
as much as me my dukedom.

  _here prospero discovers ferdinand and miranda playing at chess._

_mir._ sweet [[lord]], you play me false.

_fer._                              no, my dear’st [[love]],
i would not for the [[world]].

_mir._ yes, for a score of kingdoms [[kingdom]] you should wrangle,
and i would call it [[fair]] play.

_alon._                      if this prove                         175
a vision of the island, one dear son
shall i twice lose.

_seb._            a most high miracle!

_fer._ though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
i have cursed them without cause.               [_kneels._

_alon._                          now all the blessings
of a glad [[father]] compass thee about!                               180
arise, and say how thou camest here.

_mir._                             o, wonder!
how many goodly creatures are there here!
how beauteous [[mankind]] is! o brave new [[world]],
that has such [[people]] in’t!

_pros._                  ’tis new to thee.

_alon._ what is this maid with whom thou wast at play?             185
your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
is she the [[goddess]] that hath sever’d us,
and brought us thus together?

_fer._                      sir, she is mortal;
but by [[immortal]] providence she’s mine:
i chose her when i could not ask my [[father]]                         190
for his [[advice]], nor [[thought]] i had one. she
is [[daughter]] to this famous duke of milan,
of whom so often i have heard renown,
but never saw before; of whom i have
received a second [[life]]; and second [[father]]                          195
this [[lady]] makes him to me.

_alon._                  i am hers:
but, o, how oddly will it sound that i
must ask my child forgiveness!

_pros._                      there, sir, stop:
let us not burthen our remembrances with
a heaviness that’s gone.

_gon._                 i have inly wept,                           200
or should have spoke ere this. look down, you gods,
and on this couple drop a blessed crown!
for it is you that have chalk’d forth the way
which brought us hither.

_alon._                i say, amen, gonzalo!

_gon._ was milan thrust from milan, that his issue                 205
should become kings [[king]] of naples? o, rejoice
beyond a [[common]] joy! and set it down
with gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage
did claribel her husband find at tunis,
and ferdinand, her [[brother]], found a [[wife]]                           210
where he himself was lost, prospero his dukedom
in a [[poor]] isle, and all of us ourselves
when no [[man]] was his own.

_alon._ [_to fer. and mir._] give me your hands:
let [[grief]] and [[sorrow]] still embrace his heart
that doth not [[wish]] you joy!

_gon._                    be it so! amen!                          215

  _re-enter ariel, with the _master_ and _boatswain_ amazedly
  following._

o, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
i prophesied, if a gallows were on [[land]],
this fellow could not drown. now, blasphemy,
that swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore?
hast thou no mouth by [[land]]? what is the news?                      220

_boats._ the [[best]] news is, that we have safely found
our [[king]] and company; the next, our ship--
which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
is tight and yare and bravely rigg’d, as when
we first put out to sea.

_ari._ [_aside to pros._] sir, all this service                    225
have i done since i went.

_pros._ [_aside to ari._] my tricksy spirit!

_alon._ these are not [[natural]] events; they strengthen
from [[strange]] to stranger. say, how came you hither?

_boats._ if i did [[think]], sir, i were well awake,
i’ld strive to tell you. we were [[dead]] of sleep,                    230
and--how we [[know]] not--all clapp’d under hatches;
where, but even now, with [[strange]] and several noises
of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
and more [[diversity]] of sounds, all horrible,
we were awaked; straightway, at [[liberty]];                           235
where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
our [[royal]], [[good]], and gallant ship; our master
capering to eye her:--on a trice, so please you,
even in a [[dream]], were we divided from them,
and were brought moping hither.

_ari._ [_aside to pros._] was’t well done?                         240

_pros._ [_aside to ari._] bravely, my diligence. thou shalt be [[free]].

_alon._ this is as [[strange]] a maze as e’er [[men]] trod;
and there is in this [[business]] more than nature
was ever conduct of: some oracle
must rectify our [[knowledge]].

_pros._                   sir, my liege,                           245
do not infest your [[mind]] with beating on
the strangeness of this [[business]]; at pick’d leisure
which shall be shortly, [[single]] i’ll resolve you,
which to you shall seem probable, of every
these happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful,                  250
and [[think]] of each thing well.
    [_aside to ari._] come hither, spirit:
set caliban and his companions [[free]];
untie the spell. [_exit ariel._] how fares my gracious sir?
there are yet missing of your company
some few odd lads that you [[remember]] not.                           255

  _re-enter ariel, driving in caliban, stephano, and trinculo,
  in their stolen apparel._

_ste._ every [[man]] shift for all the rest, and let no man
take [[care]] for himself; for all is but [[fortune]]. --coragio,
bully-monster, coragio!

_trin._ if these be true spies which i wear in my head,
here’s a goodly sight.                                             260

_cal._ o setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
how fine my master is! i am afraid
he will chastise me.

_seb._             ha, ha!
what things are these, my [[lord]] antonio?
will [[money]] buy ’em?

_ant._            very like; one of them                           265
is a plain fish, and, no [[doubt]], marketable.

_pros._ mark but the badges of these [[men]], my lords [[lord]],
then say if they be true. this mis-shapen knave,
his [[mother]] was a witch; and one so strong
that could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,                  270
and deal in her command, without her [[power]].
these three have robb’d me; and this demi-devil--
for he’s a bastard one--had plotted with them
to take my [[life]]. two of these fellows you
must [[know]] and own; this thing of darkness i                        275
acknowledge mine.

_cal._          i shall be pinch’d to [[death]].

_alon._ is not this stephano, my drunken butler?

_seb._ he is drunk now: where had he wine?

_alon._ and trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?--                     280
how camest thou in this pickle?

_trin._ i have been in such a pickle, since i saw you
last, that, i [[fear]] me, will never out of my bones: i shall not
fear fly-blowing.

_seb._ why, how now, stephano!                                     285

_ste._ o, touch me not;--i am not stephano, but a cramp.

_pros._ you’ld be [[king]] o’ the isle, sirrah?

_ste._ i should have been a sore one, then.

_alon._ this is a [[strange]] thing as e’er i look’d on.
                                [_pointing to caliban._

_pros._ he is as disproportion’d in his manners                    290
as in his shape. go, sirrah, to my cell;
take with you your companions; as you look
to have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

_cal._ ay, that i will; and i’ll be [[wise]] hereafter,
and seek for grace. what a thrice-double ass                       295
was i, to take this drunkard for a [[god]],
and [[worship]] this dull fool!

_pros._                go to; away!

_alon._ hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

_seb._ or stole it, rather.    [_exeunt cal., ste., and trin._

_pros._ sir, i invite your highness and your train                 300
to my [[poor]] cell, where you shall take your rest
for this one night; which, part of it, i’ll waste
with such discourse as, i not [[doubt]], shall make it
go quick away: the story of my [[life]],
and the particular accidents gone by                               305
since i came to this isle: and in the morn
i’ll bring you to your ship, and so to naples,
where i have [[hope]] to see the nuptial
of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
and thence retire me to my milan, where                            310
every third [[thought]] shall be my grave.

_alon._                              i long
to hear the story of your [[life]], which must
take the ear strangely.

_pros._               i’ll deliver all;
and promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,
and sail so expeditious, that shall catch
your [[royal]] fleet far off. [_aside to ari._] my ariel, chick,       315
that is thy charge: then to the elements
be [[free]], and fare thou well! please you, draw near.
    [_exeunt._

epilogue.

spoken by prospero.

now my charms are all o’erthrown,
and what [[strength]] i have’s mine own,
which is most faint: now, ’tis true,
i must be here confined by you,
or sent to naples. let me not,                                       5
since i have my dukedom got,
and pardon’d the deceiver, dwell
in this bare island by your spell;
but release me from my bands
with the [[help]] of your [[good]] hands:                                   10
gentle breath of yours my sails
must fill, or else my project fails,
which was to please. now i want
spirits to enforce, art [[arts]] to enchant;
and my ending is despair,                                           15
unless i be relieved by prayer,
which pierces so, that it assaults
mercy itself, and frees all faults [[fault]].
as you from crimes would pardon’d be,
let your indulgence set me [[free]].                                    20

notes.


note i.

i. 1. 15. _what cares [[care]] these roarers._ this grammatical inaccuracy, which
escaped correction in the later folios, probably came from shakespeare’s
pen. similar cases occur frequently, especially when the verb precedes
its nominative. for [[example]], _tempest_, iv. 1. 262, ‘lies at my mercy
all mine enemies [[enemy]],’ and _measure for measure_, ii. 1. 22, ‘what knows [[know]] the
laws, &c.’ we [[correct]] it in those passages where the occurrence of a
vulgarism would be likely to annoy the reader. in the mouth of a
boatswain it can offend no one. we therefore leave it.


note ii.

i. 1. 57-59. _mercy on us!--we split, &c._ it may be doubtful whether
the printer of the first folio intended these broken speeches [[speech]] to express
‘a confused noise within.’ without [[question]] such was the author’s
meaning. rowe, however, and subsequent editors, printed them as part of
gonzalo’s [[speech]]. capell was the first editor who gave the true
arrangement.


note iii.

i. 2. 173. _princesses._ see mr sidney walker’s _shakespeare’s
versification_, p. 243 sqq. ’the plurals of substantives ending in _s_,
in [[certain]] instances, in _se_, _ss_, _ce_, and sometimes _ge_, ... are
found without the usual addition of _s_ or _es_, in pronunciation at
least, although in many instances the plural affix is added in printing,
where the metre shows that it is not to be pronounced.’

in this and other instances, we have [[thought]] it [[better]] to trust to the
ear of the reader for the rhythm than to introduce an innovation in
orthography which might perplex him as to the sense. the form
‘princesses,’ the use of which in shakespeare’s [[time]] was doubted by one
of our correspondents, is found in the _history of [[king]] leir_.

rowe’s reading ‘princes’ might be defended on the ground that the
sentiment is general, and applicable to [[royal]] [[children]] of both sexes [[sex]]; or
that sir philip sidney, in the first [[book]] of the _arcadia_, calls pamela
and philoclea ‘princes.’


note iv.

i. 2. 298. the metre of this line, as well as of lines 301, 302, is
defective, but as no mode of correction can be regarded as completely
satisfactory we have in accordance with our custom left the lines as
they are printed in the folio. the defect, indeed, in the metre of line
298 has not been noticed except by hanmer, who makes a line thus:

  ‘do so, and after two days i’ll discharge thee.’

possibly it ought to be printed thus:

              ‘do so; and
  after two days
  i will discharge thee.’

there is a broken line, also of four syllables, 253 of the same scene,
another of seven, 235.

there is no [[reason]] to [[doubt]] that the _words_ are as shakespeare wrote
them, for, although the action of the play terminates in less than four
hours (i. 2. 240 and v. 1. 186), yet ariel’s ministry is not to end till
the [[voyage]] to naples shall be over. prospero, too, repeats his promise,
and marks his contentment by further shortening the [[time]] of servitude,
‘within two days,’ i. 2. 420. possibly ‘invisible’ (301) should have a
line to itself. words thus occupying a broken line acquire a marked
emphasis.

but the [[truth]] is that in dialogue shakespeare’s [[language]] passes so
rapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even
hovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than
metrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made
with diffidence and received with [[doubt]].


note v.

i. 2. 377, 378:

  _courtsied when you have and kiss’d_
  _the wild waves whist._

this punctuation seems to be supported by what ferdinand says (391,
392):

  ‘the [[music]] crept by me upon the waters,
  allaying both their fury and my passion, &c.’

at the end of the stanza we have printed _hark, hark! ... the watch-dogs
bark_ as that part of the burthen which ‘sweet sprites bear.’ the other
part is borne by distant watch-dogs.


note vi.

i. 2. 443. _i [[fear]] you have done yourself some [[wrong]]._ see this phrase
used in a similar sense, _measure for measure_, i. 11. 39.


note vii.

ii. 1. 27. _which, of he or adrian._ ‘of’ is found in the same
construction, _midsummer night’s dream_, iii. 2. 336,

  ‘now [[follow]] if thou darest to try whose [[right]],
  of thine or mine, is most in helena.’


note viii.

ii. 1. 157. _of its own [[kind]]._ there is no [[doubt]], as dr guest has shewn,
that ‘it,’ which is the reading of the 1st and 2nd folios, was commonly
used as a genitive in shakespeare’s [[time]], as it is still in some
provincial dialects. ‘its,’ however, was coming into use. one instance
occurs in this play, i. 11. 95, ‘in its contrary.’


note ix.

ii. 1. 241. _she that from whom._ mr spedding writes: ‘the received
emendation is not satisfactory to me. i would rather [[read]], “she
that--from whom? all were sea-swallow’d &c., i.e. from whom should she
have note? the report from naples will be that all were drowned. we
shall be the only survivors.” the break in the construction seems to me
characteristic of the speaker. but you must [[read]] the whole [[speech]] to
feel the effect.’


note x.

ii. 1. 249-251. all editors except mr staunton have printed in italics
(or between inverted commas) only as far as ‘_naples?_’, but as ‘_keep_’
is printed with a small k in the folios, they seem to sanction the
arrangement given in our text.


note xi.

ii. 1. 267. _ay, sir; where lies [[lie]] that? if ’twere a kibe._ mr singer and
mr dyce have changed ‘’twere’ to ‘it were’ for the sake of the metre.
but then the first part of the line must be [[read]] with a [[wrong]] emphasis.
the proper emphasis clearly falls on the first, third, and fifth
syllables, ‘aý, sir; whére lies [[lie]] thát?’ see preface.


note xii.

ii. 2. 165. before ‘here; bear my bottle’ capell inserts a stage
direction [_to cal._], but it appears from iii. 2. 62, that trinculo was
entrusted with the office of bottle-bearer.


note xiii.

iii. 1. 15. _most busy lest, when i do it._ as none of the proposed
emendations can be regarded as [[certain]], we have left the reading of f1,
though it is manifestly [[corrupt]]. the spelling ‘doe’ makes mr spedding’s
conjecture ‘idlest’ for ‘i doe it’ more probable.


note xiv.

iii. 3. 17. the stage direction, which we have divided into two parts,
is placed all at once in the folios after ‘as when they are fresh’
[solemne and [[strange]] musicke; and [[prosper]] on the top (invisible:) enter
... depart].

pope transferred it to [[follow]] sebastian’s words, ‘i say, to night: no
more.’


note xv.

iii. 3. 48. _each putter out of five for one._ see beaumont and
fletcher, _the [[noble]] gentleman_, i. 1. (vol. ii. p. 261, ed. moxon):
‘the return will give you five for one.’ marine is about to travel.


note xvi.

iv. 1. 146. _you do look, my [[son]], in a moved sort._ seymour suggests a
transposition: ‘you do, my [[son]], look in a moved sort.’ this line however
can scarcely have come from shakespeare’s pen. perhaps the writer who
composed the masque was allowed to join it, as [[best]] he might, to
shakespeare’s words, which re-commence at ‘our revels now are ended,’
&c.


note xvii.

iv. 1. 230. _let’s alone._ see staunton’s “shakespeare,” vol. i. p. 81,
note (b).


note xviii.

v. 1. 309. _of these our dear-beloved solemnized._ the folios have
‘belov’d’; a mode of spelling, which in this case is convenient as
indicating the probable rhythm of the verse. we have written ‘beloved,’
in accordance with the general [[rule]] mentioned in the preface.

‘solemnized’ occurs in four other verse passages of shakespeare. it is
three times [[time]] to be accented ‘sólemnized’ and once (_love’s labour’s
lost_, ii. 1. 41) ‘solémnized.’

  [[pope]] 1715
    “pope was the first to indicate the _place_ of each new scene;
    as, for instance, _tempest_, i. 1. ‘on a ship at sea.’ he also
    subdivided the scenes as given by the folios and rowe, making
    a fresh scene whenever a new [[character]] entered--an arrangement
    followed by hanmer, warburton, and johnson. for convenience of
    reference to these editions, we have always recorded the
    commencement of pope’s scenes.”
