special introduction by hon. john t. morgan

in the eleven years that separated the declaration of the independence
of the [[united]] states from the completion of that act in the ordination
of our written [[constitution]], the [[great]] minds [[mind]] of [[america]] were bent upon
the study of the principles [[principle]] of [[government]] that were essential to the
preservation of the liberties [[liberty]] which had been won at [[great]] cost and with
heroic labors and sacrifices [[sacrifice]]. their studies were conducted in view of
the imperfections that [[experience]] had developed in the [[government]] of the
confederation, and they were, therefore, practical and thorough.

when the [[constitution]] was thus perfected and established, a new form of
government was created, but it was neither speculative nor experimental
as to the principles [[principle]] on which it was based. if they were true
principles, as they were, the [[government]] founded upon them was destined
to a [[life]] and an influence that would continue while the liberties [[liberty]] it
was intended to preserve should be valued by the [[human]] [[family]]. those
liberties had been wrung from reluctant monarchs in many contests,
in many countries [[country]], and were grouped into creeds and established in
ordinances sealed with [[blood]], in many [[great]] struggles of the [[people]].
they were not new to the [[people]]. they were consecrated theories, but
no [[government]] had been previously established for the [[great]] [[purpose]] of
their preservation and enforcement. that which was experimental in our
plan of [[government]] was the [[question]] whether democratic [[rule]] could be so
organized and conducted that it would not degenerate into license and
result in the [[tyranny]] of absolutism, without saving to the [[people]] the
power so often found necessary of repressing or destroying their [[enemy]],
when he was found in the [[person]] of a [[single]] despot.

when, in 1831, alexis de tocqueville came to study [[democracy]] in [[america]],
the [[trial]] of nearly a half-century of the working of our [[system]] had been
made, and it had been proved, by many crucial tests, to be a government
of "liberty regulated by [[law]]," with such results in the [[development]] of
strength, in [[population]], [[wealth]], and [[military]] and commercial [[power]], as
no [[age]] had ever witnessed.

[see alexis de tocqueville]

de tocqueville had a special inquiry to prosecute, in his visit to
america, in which his generous and faithful [[soul]] and the powers [[power]] of his
great [[intellect]] were engaged in the patriotic effort to secure to the
people of [[france]] the blessings that [[democracy]] in [[america]] had ordained
and established throughout nearly the entire western hemisphere. he had
read the story of the french [[revolution]], much of which had been recently
written in the [[blood]] of [[men]] and [[women]] of [[great]] distinction who were
his progenitors; and had witnessed the agitations and terrors of the
restoration and of the second [[republic]], fruitful in crime and [[sacrifice]],
and barren of any [[good]] to [[mankind]].

he had just witnessed the spread of republican [[government]] through all
the vast continental possessions of [[spain]] in [[america]], and the loss of
her [[great]] colonies. he had seen that these revolutions [[revolution]] were accomplished
almost without the shedding of [[blood]], and he was filled with [[anxiety]] to
learn the causes that had placed republican [[government]], in [[france]], in
such contrast with [[democracy]] in [[america]].

de tocqueville was scarcely thirty years old when he began his studies
of [[democracy]] in [[america]]. it was a bold effort for one who had no special
training in [[government]], or in the study of [[political]] economy, but he
had the [[example]] of lafayette in establishing the [[military]] foundation of
these liberties [[liberty]], and of washington, jefferson, madison, and hamilton,
all of whom were [[young]] [[men]], in building upon the independence of the
united states that wisest and [[best]] plan of general [[government]] that was
ever devised for a [[free]] [[people]].

he found that the american [[people]], through their chosen representatives
who were instructed by their [[wisdom]] and [[experience]] and were supported
by their virtues--cultivated, purified and ennobled by self-reliance and
the [[love]] of god--had matured, in the excellent [[wisdom]] of their counsels,
a new plan of [[government]], which embraced every security for their
liberties and [[equal]] rights [[right]] and privileges [[privilege]] to all in the pursuit of
happiness. he came as an honest and [[impartial]] student and his great
commentary, like those of paul, was written for the benefit of all
nations and [[people]] and in vindication of truths [[truth]] that will stand for
their deliverance from monarchical [[rule]], while [[time]] shall [[last]].

a french aristocrat of the purest strain of [[blood]] and of the most
honorable lineage, whose [[family]] influence was coveted by crowned heads;
who had no quarrel with the rulers of the nation, and was secure
against want by his inherited estates; was moved by the agitations
that compelled [[france]] to attempt to grasp suddenly the liberties [[liberty]] and
happiness we had gained in our [[revolution]] and, by his devout love
of [[france]], to search out and [[subject]] to the test of [[reason]] the
basic principles [[principle]] of [[free]] [[government]] that had been embodied in our
constitution. this was the mission of de tocqueville, and no mission
was ever more honorably or justly conducted, or concluded with greater
eclat, or [[better]] results for the welfare of [[mankind]].

his researches were logical and exhaustive. they included every phase of
every [[question]] that then seemed to be apposite to the [[great]] inquiry he
was making.

the [[judgment]] of all who have [[studied]] his commentaries seems to have been
unanimous, that his [[talents]] and learning were fully [[equal]] to his task.
he began with the physical geography of this [[country]], and examined the
characteristics of the [[people]], of all races [[race]] and conditions, their social
and [[religious]] sentiments, their [[education]] and tastes; their industries,
their commerce, their local governments [[government]], their [[passions]] and prejudices,
and their ethics and literature; leaving nothing unnoticed that might
afford an argument to prove that our plan and form of [[government]] was
or was not adapted especially to a peculiar [[people]], or that it would be
impracticable in any different [[country]], or among any different [[people]].

the [[pride]] and comfort that the american [[people]] enjoy in the great
commentaries of de tocqueville are far removed from the selfish
adulation that comes from a [[great]] and singular [[success]]. it is the
consciousness of [[victory]] over a false theory of [[government]] which has
afflicted [[mankind]] for many ages [[age]], that gives joy to the true american, as
it did to de tocqueville in his [[great]] triumph.

when de tocqueville wrote, we had lived less than fifty years under our
constitution. in that [[time]] no [[great]] national commotion had occurred that
tested its [[strength]], or its [[power]] of [[resistance]] to internal strife, such
as had converted his beloved [[france]] into fields of slaughter torn by
tempests of wrath.

he had a [[strong]] conviction that no [[government]] could be ordained that
could resist these internal forces [[force]], when, they are directed to its
destruction by [[bad]] [[men]], or unreasoning mobs, and many then believed, as
some yet [[believe]], that our [[government]] is unequal to such pressure, when
the assault is thoroughly desperate.

had de tocqueville lived to examine the [[history]] of the [[united]] states
from 1860 to 1870, his misgivings as to this [[power]] of self-preservation
would, probably, have been cleared off. he would have seen that, at
the end of the most destructive civil [[war]] that ever occurred, when
animosities of the bitterest sort had [[banished]] all [[good]] feeling from
the hearts [[heart]] of our [[people]], the states of the american union, still in
complete organization and equipped with all their official entourage,
aligned themselves in their places and took up the powers [[power]] and duties [[duty]] of
local [[government]] in [[perfect]] order and without embarrassment. this would
have dispelled his apprehensions, if he had any, about the [[power]] of the
united states to withstand the severest shocks of civil [[war]]. could he
have traced the further course of events until they open the portals of
the twentieth century, he would have cast away his fears [[fear]] of our
ability to restore [[peace]], order, and [[prosperity]], in the face of any
difficulties, and would have rejoiced to find in the [[constitution]] of the
united states the remedy that is provided for the healing of the nation.

de tocqueville examined, with the [[care]] that is worthy the importance
of the [[subject]], the [[nature]] and value of the [[system]] of "local
self-government," as we style this most important feature of our plan,
and (as has often happened) when this or any [[subject]] has become a matter
of anxious concern, his treatment of the questions [[question]] is found to have been
masterly and his preconceptions almost prophetic.

we are frequently indebted to him for able expositions and true
doctrines relating to subjects [[subject]] that have slumbered in the minds [[mind]] of the
people until they were suddenly forced on our attention by unexpected
events.

in his introductory [[chapter]], m. de tocqueville says: "amongst the novel
objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the united
states, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of
conditions." he referred, doubtless, to social and [[political]] conditions
among the [[people]] of the [[white]] [[race]], who are described as "we, the
people," in the opening sentence of the [[constitution]]. the [[last]] three
amendments of the [[constitution]] have so changed this, that those who were
then negro slaves [[slave]] are clothed with the rights [[right]] of citizenship, including
the [[right]] of suffrage. this was a [[political]] party movement, intended to
be radical and revolutionary, but it will, ultimately, react because it
has not the sanction of [[public]] [[opinion]].

if m. de tocqueville could now search for a [[law]] that would negative this
provision in its effect upon social equality, he would fail to find it.
but he would find it in the unwritten [[law]] of the [[natural]] aversion of the
races. he would find it in [[public]] [[opinion]], which is the vital [[force]] in
every [[law]] in a [[free]] [[government]]. this is a [[subject]] that our constitution
failed to regulate, because it was not contemplated by its authors. it
is a [[question]] that will settle itself, without serious difficulty. the
equality in the suffrage, thus guaranteed to the negro [[race]], alone--for
it was not intended to include other colored races--creates a new phase
of [[political]] conditions that m. de tocqueville could not foresee.
yet, in his commendation of the local town and county governments [[government]],
he applauds and sustains that elementary feature of our political
organization which, in the end, will render harmless this wide departure
from the original plan and [[purpose]] of american [[democracy]]. "local
self-government," independent of general control, except for general
purposes, is the root and origin of all [[free]] republican [[government]], and
is the antagonist of all [[great]] [[political]] combinations that threaten the
rights of minorities. it is the [[public]] [[opinion]] formed in the independent
expressions of towns and other small civil districts that is the
real conservatism of [[free]] [[government]]. it is equally the [[enemy]] of that
dangerous [[evil]], the [[corruption]] of the ballot-box, from which it is now
apprehended that one of our [[greatest]] troubles is to arise.

the voter is selected, under our laws [[law]], because he has [[certain]] physical
qualifications--age and [[sex]]. his disqualifications, when any are
imposed, relate to his [[education]] or [[property]], and to the [[fact]] that he
has not been convicted of crime. of all [[men]] he should be most directly
amenable to [[public]] [[opinion]].

the test of [[moral]] [[character]] and devotion to the duties [[duty]] of good
citizenship are ignored in the laws [[law]], because the courts can seldom deal
with such questions [[question]] in a uniform and satisfactory way, under rules [[rule]] that
apply alike to all. thus the voter, selected by [[law]] to represent himself
and four other non-voting [[citizens]], is often a [[person]] who is unfit for
any [[public]] [[duty]] or trust. in a town [[government]], having a small area of
jurisdiction, where the voice of the majority of qualified voters is
conclusive, the fitness of the [[person]] who is to exercise that high
representative [[privilege]] can be determined by his neighbors and
acquaintances, and, in the [[great]] majority of cases, it will be decided
honestly and for the [[good]] of the [[country]]. in such meetings, there is
always a spirit of loyalty to the [[state]], because that is loyalty to
the [[people]], and a reverence for [[god]] that gives weight to the duties [[duty]] and
responsibilities of citizenship.

m. de tocqueville found in these minor local jurisdictions the
theoretical conservatism which, in the aggregate, is the safest reliance
of the [[state]]. so we have found them, in practice, the true protectors
of the purity of the ballot, without which all [[free]] [[government]] will
degenerate into absolutism.

in the future of the [[republic]], we must encounter many difficult and
dangerous situations, but the principles [[principle]] established in the constitution
and the check upon hasty or inconsiderate legislation, and upon
executive action, and the supreme arbitrament of the courts, will be
found sufficient for the safety of personal rights [[right]], and for the safety
of the [[government]], and the prophetic outlook of m. de tocqueville will
be fully realized through the influence of [[democracy]] in [[america]]. each
succeeding [[generation]] of americans will find in the pure and impartial
reflections of de tocqueville a new source of [[pride]] in our institutions
of [[government]], and sound reasons [[reason]] for patriotic effort to preserve
them and to inculcate their teachings. they have mastered the [[power]] of
monarchical [[rule]] in the american hemisphere, freeing [[religion]] from all
shackles, and will spread, by a quiet but resistless influence,
through the islands of the seas to other lands [[land]], where the appeals of
de tocqueville for [[human]] rights [[right]] and liberties [[liberty]] have already inspired the
souls of the [[people]].

special introduction by hon. john j. ingalls

nearly two-thirds of a century has elapsed since the appearance of
"democracy in [[america]]," by alexis charles henri clerel de tocqueville, a
french nobleman, born at [[paris]], july 29, 1805.

bred to the [[law]], he exhibited an early predilection for [[philosophy]] and
political economy, and at twenty-two was appointed judge-auditor at the
tribunal of versailles.

in 1831, commissioned ostensibly to investigate the penitentiary system
of the [[united]] states, he visited this [[country]], with his friend, gustave
de beaumont, travelling extensively through those parts of the republic
then subdued to settlement, studying the methods of local, [[state]], and
national administration, and observing the manners and habits, the daily
life, the [[business]], the industries and occupations of the [[people]].

"democracy in [[america]]," the first of four volumes upon "american
institutions and their influence," was published in 1835. it was
received at once by the scholars and thinkers of [[europe]] as a profound,
impartial, and entertaining exposition of the principles [[principle]] of popular,
representative self-government.

napoleon, "the mighty somnambulist of a vanished [[dream]]," had abolished
feudalism and absolutism, made monarchs and dynasties obsolete, and
substituted for the [[divine]] [[right]] of kings [[king]] the sovereignty of the [[people]].

although by birth and sympathies an aristocrat, m. de tocqueville
saw that the reign of tradition and [[privilege]] at [[last]] was ended. he
perceived that [[civilization]], after many bloody centuries, had entered a
new epoch. he beheld, and deplored, the excesses that had attended the
genesis of the democratic spirit in [[france]], and while he loved [[liberty]],
he detested the crimes that had been committed in its name. belonging
neither to the class which regarded the social [[revolution]] as an
innovation to be resisted, nor to that which considered political
equality the universal panacea for the evils [[evil]] of [[humanity]], he resolved
by personal observation of the results of [[democracy]] in the new world
to ascertain its [[natural]] consequences, and to learn what the nations of
europe had to [[hope]] or [[fear]] from its final [[supremacy]].

that a [[youth]] of twenty-six should entertain a design so broad and bold
implies singular intellectual intrepidity. he had neither model
nor precedent. the vastness and novelty of the undertaking increase
admiration for the remarkable ability with which the task was performed.

were literary excellence the sole claim of "democracy in america" to
distinction, the splendor of its composition alone would entitle it to
high place among the masterpieces of the century. the first [[chapter]],
upon the exterior form of north [[america]], as the theatre upon which the
great drama is to be enacted, for graphic and picturesque description
of the physical characteristics of the continent is not surpassed
in literature: nor is there any subdivision of the [[work]] in which the
severest [[philosophy]] is not invested with the grace of poetry, and the
driest statistics with the charm of romance. western emigration seemed
commonplace and prosaic till m. de tocqueville said, "this gradual and
continuous [[progress]] of the [[european]] [[race]] toward the rocky mountains has
the solemnity of a providential event; it is like a deluge of [[men]] rising
unabatedly, and daily driven onward by the hand of god!"

the [[mind]] of m. de tocqueville had the candor of the photographic camera.
it recorded impressions with the impartiality of [[nature]]. the image was
sometimes distorted, and the perspective was not always true, but he
was neither a panegyrist, nor an advocate, nor a critic. he observed
american phenomena as illustrations, not as proof nor arguments; and
although it is apparent that the tendency of his [[mind]] was not wholly
favorable to the democratic [[principle]], yet those who dissent from his
conclusions must commend the ability and [[courage]] with which they are
expressed.

though not originally written for americans, "democracy in america" must
always remain a [[work]] of engrossing and constantly increasing interest to
citizens of the [[united]] states as the first philosophic and comprehensive
view of our [[society]], [[institutions]], and [[destiny]]. no one can rise even
from the most cursory perusal without clearer insight and more patriotic
appreciation of the blessings of [[liberty]] protected by [[law]], nor without
encouragement for the stability and perpetuity of the [[republic]]. the
causes which appeared to m. de tocqueville to menace both, have gone.
the despotism of [[public]] [[opinion]], the [[tyranny]] of majorities, the absence
of intellectual [[freedom]] which seemed to him to degrade administration
and bring statesmanship, learning, and literature to the level of the
lowest, are no longer considered. the [[violence]] of party spirit has
been mitigated, and the [[judgment]] of the [[wise]] is not subordinated to the
prejudices of the ignorant.

other dangers have come. equality of conditions no longer exists.
prophets of [[evil]] predict the downfall of [[democracy]], but the student
of m. de tocqueville will find consolation and encouragement in the
reflection that the same spirit which has vanquished the perils of
the [[past]], which he foresaw, will be equally prepared for the
responsibilities of the [[present]] and the future.

the [[last]] of the four volumes of m. de tocqueville's [[work]] upon american
institutions appeared in 1840.

in 1838 he was chosen member of the academy of [[moral]] and political
sciences. in 1839 he was elected to the chamber of deputies. he became
a member of the french academy in 1841. in 1848 he was in the assembly,
and from june 2nd to october 31st he was minister of [[foreign]] affairs.
the coup d'etat of december 2, 1851 drove him from the [[public]] service.
in 1856 he published "the old regime and the [[revolution]]." he died at
cannes, april 15, 1859, at the [[age]] of fifty-four.

introductory chapter

amongst the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay
in the [[united]] states, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general
equality of conditions. i readily discovered the prodigious influence
which this primary [[fact]] exercises on the whole course of [[society]], by
giving a [[certain]] direction to [[public]] [[opinion]], and a [[certain]] tenor to
the laws [[law]]; by imparting new maxims [[maxim]] to the governing powers [[power]], and peculiar
habits to the governed. i speedily perceived that the influence of this
fact extends far beyond the [[political]] [[character]] and the laws [[law]] of the
country, and that it has no less [[empire]] over civil [[society]] than over
the [[government]]; it creates opinions [[opinion]], engenders sentiments, suggests the
ordinary practices of [[life]], and modifies whatever it does not [[produce]].
the more i advanced in the study of american [[society]], the more i
perceived that the equality of conditions is the fundamental [[fact]] from
which all others seem to be derived, and the central point at which all
my observations constantly terminated.

i then turned my thoughts [[thought]] to our own hemisphere, where i imagined that
i discerned something analogous to the spectacle which the new world
presented to me. i observed that the equality of conditions is daily
progressing towards those extreme limits which it seems to have reached
in the [[united]] states, and that the [[democracy]] which governs the american
communities appears to be rapidly rising into [[power]] in [[europe]]. i hence
conceived the [[idea]] of the [[book]] which is now before the reader.

it is evident to all alike that a [[great]] democratic [[revolution]] is
going on amongst us; but there are two opinions [[opinion]] as to its [[nature]] and
consequences. to some it appears to be a novel accident, which as such
may still be checked; to others it seems irresistible, because it is the
most uniform, the most ancient, and the most permanent tendency which is
to be found in [[history]]. let us recollect the situation of [[france]] seven
hundred years ago, when the territory was divided amongst a small number
of families [[family]], who were the owners of the soil and the rulers of
the inhabitants; the [[right]] of governing descended with the family
inheritance from [[generation]] to [[generation]]; [[force]] was the only means by
which [[man]] could act on [[man]], and landed [[property]] was the sole source of
power. soon, however, the [[political]] [[power]] of the clergy was founded, and
began to exert itself: the clergy opened its ranks to all classes, to
the [[poor]] and the [[rich]], the villein and the [[lord]]; equality penetrated
into the [[government]] through the [[church]], and the being who as a serf must
have vegetated in perpetual bondage took his place as a [[priest]] in the
midst of nobles [[noble]], and not infrequently above the heads of kings [[king]].

the different relations of [[men]] became more complicated and more numerous
as [[society]] gradually became more stable and more civilized. thence the
want of civil laws [[law]] was [[felt]]; and the order of legal functionaries soon
rose from the obscurity of the tribunals and their dusty chambers, to
appear at the court of the monarch, by the side of the feudal barons in
their ermine and their mail. whilst the kings [[king]] were ruining themselves
by their [[great]] enterprises, and the nobles [[noble]] exhausting their resources
by private wars [[war]], the lower orders were enriching themselves by commerce.
the influence of [[money]] began to be perceptible in [[state]] affairs. the
transactions of [[business]] opened a new road to [[power]], and the financier
rose to a station of [[political]] influence in which he was at once
flattered and despised. gradually the spread of mental acquirements, and
the increasing taste for literature and art [[arts]], opened chances [[chance]] of success
to talent; [[science]] became a means of [[government]], [[intelligence]] [[led]] to
social [[power]], and the [[man]] of letters took a part in the affairs of the
state. the value attached to the privileges [[privilege]] of birth decreased in the
exact proportion in which new paths were struck out to advancement. in
the eleventh century nobility was beyond all price; in the thirteenth
it might be purchased; it was conferred for the first [[time]] in 1270;
and equality was thus introduced into the [[government]] by the aristocracy
itself.

in the course of these seven hundred years it sometimes happened that in
order to resist the [[authority]] of the [[crown]], or to diminish the [[power]] of
their rivals, the nobles [[noble]] granted a [[certain]] share of [[political]] rights [[right]] to
the [[people]]. or, more frequently, the [[king]] permitted the lower orders
to enjoy a [[degree]] of [[power]], with the intention of repressing the
aristocracy. in [[france]] the kings [[king]] have always been the most active and
the most constant of levellers. when they were [[strong]] and ambitious they
spared no pains [[pain]] to raise the [[people]] to the level of the nobles [[noble]]; when
they were temperate or [[weak]] they allowed the [[people]] to rise above
themselves. some assisted the [[democracy]] by their [[talents]], others by
their vices [[vice]]. louis xi and louis xiv reduced every rank beneath the
throne to the same subjection; louis xv descended, himself and all his
court, into the dust.

as soon as [[land]] was held on any other than a feudal tenure, and
personal [[property]] began in its turn to confer influence and [[power]], every
improvement which was introduced in commerce or manufacture was a fresh
element of the equality of conditions. henceforward every new discovery,
every new want which it engendered, and every new [[desire]] which craved
satisfaction, was a step towards the universal level. the taste for
luxury, the [[love]] of [[war]], the sway of [[fashion]], and the most superficial
as well as the deepest [[passions]] of the [[human]] [[heart]], co-operated to
enrich the [[poor]] and to impoverish the [[rich]].

from the [[time]] when the exercise of the [[intellect]] became the source of
strength and of [[wealth]], it is impossible not to consider every addition
to [[science]], every fresh [[truth]], and every new [[idea]] as a germ of power
placed within the reach of the [[people]]. poetry, eloquence, and memory,
the grace of wit, the glow of [[imagination]], the depth of [[thought]], and all
the gifts which are bestowed by providence with an [[equal]] hand, turned
to the advantage of the [[democracy]]; and even when they were in the
possession of its adversaries they still served its cause by throwing
into relief the [[natural]] greatness of [[man]]; its conquests spread,
therefore, with those of [[civilization]] and [[knowledge]], and literature
became an arsenal where the poorest and the weakest could always find
weapons to their hand.

in perusing the pages of our [[history]], we shall scarcely meet with a
single [[great]] event, in the lapse of seven hundred years, which has not
turned to the advantage of equality. the crusades and the wars [[war]] of the
english decimated the nobles [[noble]] and divided their possessions; the erection
of communities [[community]] introduced an element of democratic [[liberty]] into the
bosom of feudal [[monarchy]]; the invention of fire-arms equalized the
villein and the [[noble]] on the field of [[battle]]; printing opened the same
resources to the minds [[mind]] of all classes; the post was organized so as to
bring the same information to the door of the [[poor]] man's [[man]] cottage and to
the gate of the palace; and protestantism proclaimed that all [[men]] are
alike able to find the road to [[heaven]]. the discovery of [[america]] offered
a thousand new paths to [[fortune]], and placed riches [[rich]] and [[power]] within
the reach of the adventurous and the obscure. if we examine what has
happened in [[france]] at intervals of fifty years, beginning with the
eleventh century, we shall invariably perceive that a twofold revolution
has taken place in the [[state]] of [[society]]. the [[noble]] has gone down on the
social ladder, and the roturier has gone up; the one descends as the
other rises. every half century brings them nearer to each other, and
they will very shortly meet.

nor is this phenomenon at all peculiar to [[france]]. whithersoever we turn
our [[eyes]] we shall witness the same continual [[revolution]] throughout the
whole of christendom. the various occurrences of national existence have
everywhere turned to the advantage of [[democracy]]; all [[men]] have aided it
by their exertions: those who have intentionally labored in its cause,
and those who have served it unwittingly; those who have fought for
it and those who have declared themselves its opponents, have all
been driven along in the same track, have all labored to one end, some
ignorantly and some unwillingly; all have been blind instruments in the
hands of [[god]].

the gradual [[development]] of the equality of conditions is therefore a
providential [[fact]], and it possesses all the characteristics of a divine
decree: it is universal, it is durable, it constantly eludes all human
interference, and all events as well as all [[men]] contribute to its
progress. would it, then, be [[wise]] to imagine that a social impulse which
dates from so far back can be checked by the efforts of a [[generation]]? is
it credible that the [[democracy]] which has annihilated the feudal system
and vanquished kings [[king]] will [[respect]] the citizen and the capitalist? will
it stop now that it has grown so [[strong]] and its adversaries so [[weak]]?
none can say which way we are going, for all terms of comparison are
wanting: the equality of conditions is more complete in the christian
countries of the [[present]] day than it has been at any [[time]] or in any part
of the [[world]]; so that the extent of what already exists prevents us from
foreseeing what may be yet to come.

the whole [[book]] which is here offered to the [[public]] has been written
under the impression of a [[kind]] of [[religious]] dread produced in the
author's [[mind]] by the contemplation of so irresistible a [[revolution]],
which has advanced for centuries in spite of such amazing obstacles, and
which is still proceeding in the midst of the ruins it has made. it is
not necessary that [[god]] himself should speak in order to disclose to
us the unquestionable signs of his will; we can discern them in the
habitual course of [[nature]], and in the invariable tendency of events: i
know, without a special revelation, that the planets move in the orbits
traced by the creator's finger. if the [[men]] of our [[time]] were [[led]] by
attentive observation and by sincere reflection to acknowledge that the
gradual and progressive [[development]] of social equality is at once the
past and future of their [[history]], this solitary [[truth]] would confer the
sacred [[character]] of a [[divine]] decree upon the [[change]]. to attempt to
check [[democracy]] would be in that case to resist the will of [[god]]; and
the nations would then be constrained to make the [[best]] of the social lot
awarded to them by providence.

the [[christian]] nations of our [[age]] seem to me to [[present]] a most alarming
spectacle; the impulse which is bearing them along is so [[strong]] that it
cannot be stopped, but it is not yet so rapid that it cannot be guided:
their [[fate]] is in their hands; yet a little while and it may be so no
longer. the first [[duty]] which is at this [[time]] imposed upon those who
direct our affairs is to educate the [[democracy]]; to warm its [[faith]],
if that be possible; to purify its morals [[moral]]; to direct its energies;
to substitute a [[knowledge]] of [[business]] for its inexperience, and an
acquaintance with its true interests for its blind propensities; to
adapt its [[government]] to [[time]] and place, and to modify it in compliance
with the occurrences and the actors of the [[age]]. a new [[science]] of
politics is indispensable to a new [[world]]. this, however, is what we
think of least; launched in the middle of a rapid stream, we obstinately
fix our [[eyes]] on the ruins which may still be described upon the shore we
have left, whilst the current sweeps us along, and drives us backwards
towards the gulf.

in no [[country]] in [[europe]] has the [[great]] social [[revolution]] which i have
been describing made such rapid [[progress]] as in [[france]]; but it has always
been borne on by [[chance]]. the heads of the [[state]] have never had any
forethought for its exigencies, and its victories [[victory]] have been obtained
without their [[consent]] or without their [[knowledge]]. the most powerful, the
most [[intelligent]], and the most [[moral]] classes of the nation have never
attempted to connect themselves with it in order to guide it. the people
has consequently been abandoned to its wild propensities, and it has
grown up like those outcasts who receive their [[education]] in the
public streets, and who are unacquainted with aught but the vices [[vice]] and
wretchedness of [[society]]. the existence of a [[democracy]] was seemingly
unknown, when on a sudden it took possession of the supreme [[power]].
everything was then submitted to its caprices; it was worshipped as the
idol of [[strength]]; until, when it was enfeebled by its own excesses, the
legislator conceived the rash project of annihilating its [[power]], instead
of instructing it and correcting its vices [[vice]]; no attempt was made to fit
it to govern, but all were bent on excluding it from the [[government]].

the consequence of this has been that the democratic [[revolution]] has been
effected only in the material parts of [[society]], without that concomitant
change in laws [[law]], ideas [[idea]], customs, and manners which was necessary to
render such a [[revolution]] beneficial. we have gotten a [[democracy]], but
without the conditions which lessen its vices [[vice]] and render its natural
advantages more prominent; and although we already perceive the evils [[evil]] it
brings, we are ignorant of the benefits it may confer.

while the [[power]] of the [[crown]], supported by the [[aristocracy]], peaceably
governed the nations of [[europe]], [[society]] possessed, in the midst of its
wretchedness, several different advantages which can now scarcely be
appreciated or conceived. the [[power]] of a part of his subjects [[subject]] was an
insurmountable barrier to the [[tyranny]] of the [[prince]]; and the monarch,
who [[felt]] the almost [[divine]] [[character]] which he enjoyed in the [[eyes]] of
the multitude, derived a motive for the just use of his [[power]] from the
respect which he inspired. high as they were placed above the [[people]],
the nobles [[noble]] could not but take that calm and benevolent interest in
its [[fate]] which the shepherd feels [[feel]] towards his flock; and without
acknowledging the [[poor]] as their equals [[equal]], they watched over the [[destiny]] of
those whose welfare providence had entrusted to their [[care]]. the people
never having conceived the [[idea]] of a social condition different from its
own, and entertaining no expectation of ever ranking with its chiefs [[chief]],
received benefits from them without discussing their rights [[right]]. it grew
attached to them when they were clement and just, and it submitted
without [[resistance]] or servility to their exactions, as to the inevitable
visitations of the arm of [[god]]. custom, and the manners of the [[time]],
had moreover created a [[species]] of [[law]] in the midst of [[violence]], and
established [[certain]] limits to oppression. as the [[noble]] never suspected
that anyone would attempt to deprive him of the privileges [[privilege]] which
he believed to be legitimate, and as the serf looked upon his own
inferiority as a consequence of the immutable order of [[nature]], it is
easy to imagine that a mutual exchange of good-will took place between
two classes so differently gifted by [[fate]]. inequality and wretchedness
were then to be found in [[society]]; but the souls [[soul]] of neither rank of men
were degraded. [[men]] are not corrupted by the exercise of [[power]] or debased
by the habit of [[obedience]], but by the exercise of a [[power]] which they
believe to be illegal and by [[obedience]] to a [[rule]] which they consider
to be usurped and oppressive. on one side was [[wealth]], [[strength]], and
leisure, accompanied by the refinements of luxury, the elegance of
taste, the pleasures [[pleasure]] of wit, and the [[religion]] of art [[arts]]. on the other was
labor and a rude ignorance; but in the midst of this coarse and ignorant
multitude it was not uncommon to meet with energetic [[passions]], generous
sentiments, profound [[religious]] convictions, and independent virtues [[virtue]]. the
body of a [[state]] thus organized might boast of its stability, its [[power]],
and, above all, of its [[glory]].

but the scene is now changed, and gradually the two ranks mingle; the
divisions which once severed [[mankind]] are lowered, [[property]] is divided,
power is held in [[common]], the [[light]] of [[intelligence]] spreads, and the
capacities of all classes are equally cultivated; the [[state]] becomes
democratic, and the [[empire]] of [[democracy]] is slowly and peaceably
introduced into the [[institutions]] and the manners of the nation. i can
conceive a [[society]] in which all [[men]] would profess an [[equal]] attachment
and [[respect]] for the laws [[law]] of which they are the [[common]] authors; in which
the [[authority]] of the [[state]] would be respected as necessary, though not
as [[divine]]; and the loyalty of the [[subject]] to its [[chief]] magistrate would
not be a passion, but a quiet and [[rational]] persuasion. every individual
being in the possession of rights [[right]] which he is sure to retain, a [[kind]] of
manly reliance and reciprocal courtesy would arise between all classes,
alike removed from [[pride]] and meanness. the [[people]], well acquainted
with its true interests, would allow that in order to [[profit]] by the
advantages of [[society]] it is necessary to satisfy its demands. in this
state of things the voluntary association of the [[citizens]] might supply
the [[individual]] exertions of the nobles [[noble]], and the [[community]] would be alike
protected from [[anarchy]] and from oppression.

i admit that, in a democratic [[state]] thus constituted, [[society]] will not
be stationary; but the impulses of the social [[body]] may be regulated and
directed forwards; if there be less splendor than in the halls of an
aristocracy, the contrast of misery will be less frequent also; the
pleasures of enjoyment may be less excessive, but those of comfort will
be more general; the sciences [[science]] may be less perfectly cultivated, but
ignorance will be less [[common]]; the impetuosity of the feelings will be
repressed, and the habits of the nation softened; there will be more
vices and fewer crimes. in the absence of enthusiasm and of an
ardent [[faith]], [[great]] sacrifices [[sacrifice]] may be obtained from the members of a
commonwealth by an appeal to their understandings and their [[experience]];
each [[individual]] will [[feel]] the same necessity for uniting with his
fellow-citizens to [[protect]] his own weakness; and as he knows [[know]] that if
they are to assist he must co-operate, he will readily perceive that his
personal interest is identified with the interest of the [[community]]. the
nation, taken as a whole, will be less brilliant, less glorious, and
perhaps less [[strong]]; but the majority of the [[citizens]] will enjoy a
greater [[degree]] of [[prosperity]], and the [[people]] will remain quiet, not
because it despairs of amelioration, but because it is conscious of the
advantages of its condition. if all the consequences of this [[state]] of
things were not [[good]] or useful, [[society]] would at least have appropriated
all such as were useful and [[good]]; and having once and for ever
renounced the social advantages of [[aristocracy]], [[mankind]] would enter into
possession of all the benefits which [[democracy]] can afford.

but here it may be [[asked]] what we have adopted in the place of those
institutions, those ideas [[idea]], and those customs of our forefathers which
we have abandoned. the spell of royalty is broken, but it has not been
succeeded by the majesty of the laws [[law]]; the [[people]] has learned to despise
all [[authority]], but [[fear]] now extorts a larger tribute of [[obedience]] than
that which was formerly paid by reverence and by [[love]].

i perceive that we have destroyed those independent beings which were
able to cope with [[tyranny]] single-handed; but it is the government
that has inherited the privileges [[privilege]] of which families [[family]], corporations, and
individuals have been deprived; the weakness of the whole [[community]] has
therefore succeeded that influence of a small [[body]] of [[citizens]], which,
if it was sometimes oppressive, was often conservative. the division
of [[property]] has lessened the distance which separated the [[rich]] from the
poor; but it would seem that the nearer they draw to each other, the
greater is their mutual [[hatred]], and the more vehement the envy and the
dread with which they resist each other's claims to [[power]]; the notion of
right is alike insensible to both classes, and [[force]] affords to both the
only argument for the [[present]], and the only guarantee for the future.
the [[poor]] [[man]] retains the prejudices of his forefathers without their
faith, and their ignorance without their virtues [[virtue]]; he has adopted
the doctrine of self-interest as the [[rule]] of his actions, without
understanding the [[science]] which controls it, and his egotism is no less
blind than his devotedness was formerly. if [[society]] is tranquil, it is
not because it relies upon its [[strength]] and its well-being, but because
it knows [[know]] its weakness and its infirmities; a [[single]] effort may cost it
its [[life]]; everybody feels [[feel]] the [[evil]], but no one has [[courage]] or energy
enough to seek the cure; the desires [[desire]], the regret, the sorrows [[sorrow]], and the
joys of the [[time]] [[produce]] nothing that is visible or permanent, like the
passions of old [[men]] which terminate in impotence.

we have, then, abandoned whatever advantages the old [[state]] of things
afforded, without receiving any compensation from our [[present]] condition;
we have destroyed an [[aristocracy]], and we seem inclined to survey its
ruins with complacency, and to fix our abode in the midst of them.

the phenomena which the intellectual [[world]] presents [[present]] are not less
deplorable. the [[democracy]] of [[france]], checked in its course or abandoned
to its lawless [[passions]], has overthrown whatever crossed its path, and
has shaken all that it has not destroyed. its [[empire]] on [[society]] has
not been gradually introduced or peaceably established, but it has
constantly advanced in the midst of disorder and the agitation of a
conflict. in the heat of the struggle each partisan is hurried beyond
the limits of his opinions [[opinion]] by the opinions [[opinion]] and the excesses of his
opponents, until he loses sight of the end of his exertions, and holds a
language which disguises his real sentiments or secret instincts. hence
arises the [[strange]] confusion which we are witnessing. i cannot recall to
my [[mind]] a passage in [[history]] more worthy of [[sorrow]] and of [[pity]] than the
scenes which are happening under our [[eyes]]; it is as if the [[natural]] bond
which unites the opinions [[opinion]] of [[man]] to his tastes and his actions to
his principles [[principle]] was now broken; the sympathy which has always been
acknowledged between the feelings and the ideas [[idea]] of [[mankind]] appears to
be dissolved, and all the laws [[law]] of [[moral]] analogy to be abolished.

zealous christians [[christian]] may be found amongst us whose minds [[mind]] are nurtured in
the [[love]] and [[knowledge]] of a future [[life]], and who readily espouse
the cause of [[human]] [[liberty]] as the source of all [[moral]] greatness.
christianity, which has declared that all [[men]] are [[equal]] in the sight of
god, will not refuse to acknowledge that all [[citizens]] are [[equal]] in the
eye of the [[law]]. but, by a singular concourse of events, [[religion]] is
entangled in those [[institutions]] which [[democracy]] assails, and it is not
unfrequently brought to reject the equality it loves [[love]], and to curse that
cause of [[liberty]] as a foe which it might hallow by its [[alliance]].

by the side of these [[religious]] [[men]] i discern others whose looks are
turned to the [[earth]] more than to [[heaven]]; they are the partisans of
liberty, not only as the source of the noblest virtues [[virtue]], but more
especially as the root of all solid advantages; and they sincerely
desire to extend its sway, and to impart its blessings to [[mankind]]. it
is [[natural]] that they should hasten to invoke the assistance of [[religion]],
for they must [[know]] that [[liberty]] cannot be established without morality,
nor morality without [[faith]]; but they have seen [[religion]] in the ranks of
their adversaries, and they inquire no further; some of them attack it
openly, and the remainder are afraid to defend it.

in former ages [[age]] [[slavery]] has been advocated by the venal and
slavish-minded, whilst the independent and the warm-hearted were
struggling without [[hope]] to save the liberties [[liberty]] of [[mankind]]. but [[men]] of
high and generous characters [[character]] are now to be met with, whose opinions [[opinion]] are
at variance with their inclinations, and who [[praise]] that servility which
they have themselves never known. others, on the contrary, speak in
the name of [[liberty]], as if they were able to [[feel]] its [[sanctity]] and its
majesty, and loudly claim for [[humanity]] those rights [[right]] which they have
always disowned. there are [[virtuous]] and peaceful individuals [[individual]] whose
pure morality, quiet habits, affluence, and [[talents]] fit them to be the
leaders of the surrounding [[population]]; their [[love]] of their [[country]] is
sincere, and they are prepared to make the [[greatest]] sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to its
welfare, but they confound the abuses [[abuse]] of [[civilization]] with its benefits,
and the [[idea]] of [[evil]] is inseparable in their minds [[mind]] from that of novelty.

not far from this class is another party, whose object is to materialize
mankind, to hit upon what is expedient without heeding what is just,
to acquire [[knowledge]] without [[faith]], and [[prosperity]] apart from [[virtue]];
assuming the title of the champions of [[modern]] [[civilization]], and placing
themselves in a station which they usurp with insolence, and from
which they are driven by their own unworthiness. where are we then?
the religionists are the enemies [[enemy]] of [[liberty]], and the [[friends]] of liberty
attack [[religion]]; the high-minded and the [[noble]] advocate subjection,
and the meanest and most servile minds [[mind]] preach independence; honest and
enlightened [[citizens]] are opposed to all [[progress]], whilst [[men]] without
patriotism and without principles [[principle]] are the [[apostles]] of [[civilization]] and
of [[intelligence]]. has such been the [[fate]] of the centuries which have
preceded our own? and has [[man]] always inhabited a [[world]] like the [[present]],
where nothing is linked together, where [[virtue]] is without genius, and
genius without [[honor]]; where the [[love]] of order is confounded with a taste
for oppression, and the holy rites of [[freedom]] with a contempt of [[law]];
where the [[light]] thrown by [[conscience]] on [[human]] actions is dim, and
where nothing seems to be any longer forbidden or allowed, honorable
or shameful, false or true? i cannot, however, [[believe]] that the creator
made [[man]] to leave him in an endless struggle with the intellectual
miseries which surround us: [[god]] destines a calmer and a more certain
future to the communities [[community]] of [[europe]]; i am unacquainted with his designs,
but i shall not cease to [[believe]] in them because i cannot fathom them,
and i had rather mistrust my own capacity than his [[justice]].

there is a [[country]] in the [[world]] where the [[great]] [[revolution]] which i am
speaking of seems nearly to have reached its [[natural]] limits; it has
been effected with ease and simplicity, say rather that this country
has attained the consequences of the democratic [[revolution]] which we
are undergoing without having experienced the [[revolution]] itself. the
emigrants who fixed themselves on the shores of [[america]] in the beginning
of the seventeenth century severed the democratic [[principle]] from all
the principles [[principle]] which repressed it in the old communities [[community]] of [[europe]], and
transplanted it unalloyed to the new [[world]]. it has there been allowed to
spread in [[perfect]] [[freedom]], and to put forth its consequences in the laws
by influencing the manners of the [[country]].

it appears to me beyond a [[doubt]] that sooner or later we shall arrive,
like the americans, at an almost complete equality of conditions. but i
do not conclude from this that we shall ever be necessarily [[led]] to draw
the same [[political]] consequences which the americans have derived from
a similar social organization. i am far from supposing that they have
chosen the only form of [[government]] which a [[democracy]] may adopt; but the
identity of the efficient cause of laws [[law]] and manners in the two countries
is sufficient to account for the immense interest we have in becoming
acquainted with its effects in each of them.

it is not, then, merely to satisfy a legitimate curiosity that i have
examined [[america]]; my [[wish]] has been to find instruction by which we may
ourselves [[profit]]. whoever should imagine that i have intended to write a
panegyric will perceive that such was not my design; nor has it been
my object to advocate any form of [[government]] in particular, for i am
of [[opinion]] that absolute excellence is rarely to be found in any
legislation; i have not even affected to discuss whether the social
revolution, which i [[believe]] to be irresistible, is advantageous or
prejudicial to [[mankind]]; i have acknowledged this [[revolution]] as a fact
already accomplished or on the eve of its accomplishment; and i have
selected the nation, from amongst those which have undergone it, in
which its [[development]] has been the most peaceful and the most complete,
in order to discern its [[natural]] consequences, and, if it be possible, to
distinguish the means by which it may be rendered profitable. i confess
that in [[america]] i saw more than [[america]]; i sought the image of democracy
itself, with its inclinations, its [[character]], its prejudices, and its
passions, in order to learn what we have to [[fear]] or to [[hope]] from its
progress.

in the first part of this [[work]] i have attempted to show the tendency
given to the laws [[law]] by the [[democracy]] of [[america]], which is abandoned almost
without restraint to its instinctive propensities, and to exhibit the
course it prescribes to the [[government]] and the influence it exercises on
affairs. i have sought to discover the evils [[evil]] and the advantages which
it produces [[produce]]. i have examined the precautions used by the americans to
direct it, as well as those which they have not adopted, and i have
undertaken to point out the causes which enable it to govern [[society]].
i do not [[know]] whether i have succeeded in making known what i saw in
america, but i am [[certain]] that such has been my sincere [[desire]], and that
i have never, knowingly, moulded facts [[fact]] to ideas [[idea]], instead of ideas [[idea]] to
facts.

whenever a point could be established by the aid of written documents,
i have had recourse to the original text, and to the most authentic and
approved works [[work]]. i have cited my authorities [[authority]] in the notes, and anyone may
refer to them. whenever an [[opinion]], a [[political]] custom, or a remark on
the manners of the [[country]] was concerned, i endeavored to consult the
most enlightened [[men]] i met with. if the point in [[question]] was important
or doubtful, i was not satisfied with one testimony, but i formed my
opinion on the evidence of several witnesses. here the reader must
necessarily [[believe]] me upon my word. i could frequently have quoted names
which are either known to him, or which deserve to be so, in proof of
what i advance; but i have carefully abstained from this practice. a
stranger frequently hears important truths [[truth]] at the fire-side of his host,
which the latter would perhaps conceal from the ear of [[friendship]];
he consoles himself with his guest for the [[silence]] to which he is
restricted, and the shortness of the traveller's stay takes away all
fear of his indiscretion. i carefully noted every conversation of this
nature as soon as it occurred, but these notes will never leave my
writing-case; i had rather injure the [[success]] of my statements than
add my name to the list of those strangers who repay the generous
hospitality they have received by subsequent chagrin and annoyance.

i am aware that, notwithstanding my [[care]], nothing will be easier than
to criticise this [[book]], if anyone ever chooses to criticise it. those
readers who may examine it closely will discover the fundamental idea
which connects the several parts together. but the [[diversity]] of the
subjects i have had to treat is exceedingly [[great]], and it will not be
difficult to oppose an isolated [[fact]] to the [[body]] of facts [[fact]] which i quote,
or an isolated [[idea]] to the [[body]] of ideas [[idea]] i put forth. i [[hope]] to be read
in the spirit which has guided my labors, and that my [[book]] may be judged
by the general impression it leaves, as i have formed my own judgment
not on any [[single]] [[reason]], but upon the mass of evidence. it must not be
forgotten that the author who wishes [[wish]] to be understood is obliged to push
all his ideas [[idea]] to their utmost theoretical consequences, and often to
the verge of what is false or impracticable; for if it be necessary
sometimes to quit the rules [[rule]] of [[logic]] in active [[life]], such is not the
case in discourse, and a [[man]] finds that almost as many difficulties
spring from inconsistency of [[language]] as usually arise from
inconsistency of conduct.

i conclude by pointing out myself what many readers will consider
the principal defect of the [[work]]. this [[book]] is written to favor no
particular views, and in composing it i have entertained no designs
of serving or attacking any party; i have undertaken not to see
differently, but to look further than parties, and whilst they are
busied for the morrow i have turned my thoughts [[thought]] to the future.




chapter i: exterior form of north america

chapter summary

north [[america]] divided into two vast regions, one inclining towards the
pole, the other towards the equator--valley of the mississippi--traces
of the revolutions [[revolution]] of the globe--shore of the atlantic ocean where the
english colonies were founded--difference in the appearance of north
and of south [[america]] at the [[time]] of their discovery--forests of
north america--prairies--wandering tribes of natives--their outward
appearance, manners, and language--traces of an unknown [[people]].

exterior form of north america


north [[america]] presents [[present]] in its external form [[certain]] general features
which it is easy to discriminate at the first glance. a sort of
methodical order seems to have regulated the separation of [[land]] and
water, mountains and valleys. a simple, but grand, arrangement is
discoverable amidst the confusion of objects and the prodigious variety
of scenes. this continent is divided, almost equally, into two vast
regions, one of which is bounded on the north by the arctic pole, and
by the two [[great]] oceans on the east and west. it stretches towards the
south, forming a triangle whose irregular sides meet at length below
the [[great]] lakes of canada. the second region begins where the other
terminates, and includes all the remainder of the continent. the one
slopes gently towards the pole, the other towards the equator.

the territory comprehended in the first region descends towards the
north with so imperceptible a slope that it may almost be said to form
a level plain. within the bounds of this immense tract of [[country]] there
are neither high mountains nor deep valleys. streams meander through it
irregularly: [[great]] rivers mix their currents, separate and meet again,
disperse and form vast marshes, losing all trace of their channels
in the labyrinth of waters they have themselves created; and thus, at
length, after innumerable windings, fall into the polar seas. the great
lakes which bound this first region are not walled in, like most of
those in the old [[world]], between hills and rocks. their banks are flat,
and rise but a few feet above the level of their waters; each of them
thus forming a vast bowl filled to the brim. the slightest [[change]] in the
structure of the globe would cause their waters to rush either towards
the pole or to the tropical sea.

the second region is more varied on its surface, and [[better]] suited for
the habitation of [[man]]. two long chains of mountains divide it from one
extreme to the other; the alleghany ridge takes the form of the shores
of the atlantic ocean; the other is parallel with the pacific. the space
which lies [[lie]] between these two chains of mountains contains 1,341,649
square miles. *a its surface is therefore about six times [[time]] as [[great]] as
that of [[france]]. this vast territory, however, forms a [[single]] valley,
one side of which descends gradually from the rounded summits of the
alleghanies, while the other rises in an uninterrupted course towards
the tops of the rocky mountains. at the bottom of the valley flows an
immense river, into which the various streams issuing from the mountains
fall from all parts. in memory of their native [[land]], the french formerly
called this river the st. louis. the indians [[indian]], in their pompous [[language]],
have named it the [[father]] of waters, or the mississippi.

[footnote a: darby's "view of the [[united]] states."]

the mississippi takes its source above the limit of the two great
regions of which i have spoken, not far from the highest point of the
table-land where they unite. near the same spot rises another river, *b
which empties itself into the polar seas. the course of the mississippi
is at first dubious: it winds several times [[time]] towards the north, from
whence it rose; and at length, after having been delayed in lakes and
marshes, it flows slowly onwards to the south. sometimes quietly gliding
along the argillaceous bed which [[nature]] has assigned to it, sometimes
swollen by storms, the mississippi waters 2,500 miles in its course.
*c at the distance of 1,364 miles from its mouth this river attains an
average depth of fifteen feet; and it is navigated by vessels of
300 tons burden for a course of nearly 500 miles. fifty-seven large
navigable rivers contribute to swell the waters of the mississippi;
amongst others, the missouri, which traverses a space of 2,500 miles;
the arkansas of 1,300 miles, the red river 1,000 miles, four whose
course is from 800 to 1,000 miles in length, viz., the illinois, the
st. peter's, the st. francis, and the moingona; besides a countless
multitude of rivulets which unite from all parts their tributary
streams.

[footnote b: the red river.]

[footnote c: warden's "description of the [[united]] states."]

the valley which is watered by the mississippi seems formed to be the
bed of this mighty river, which, like a [[god]] of antiquity, dispenses both
good and [[evil]] in its course. on the shores of the stream [[nature]] displays
an inexhaustible fertility; in proportion as you recede from its banks,
the powers [[power]] of vegetation languish, the soil becomes [[poor]], and the plants
that survive have a sickly [[growth]]. nowhere have the [[great]] convulsions
of the globe left more evident traces than in the valley of the
mississippi; the whole aspect of the [[country]] shows the powerful effects
of water, both by its fertility and by its barrenness. the waters of
the primeval ocean accumulated enormous beds of vegetable mould in the
valley, which they levelled as they retired. upon the [[right]] shore of the
river are seen immense plains, as smooth as if the husbandman had
passed over them with his roller. as you approach the mountains the soil
becomes more and more unequal and sterile; the ground is, as it were,
pierced in a thousand places by primitive rocks, which appear like the
bones of a skeleton whose flesh is partly consumed. the surface of the
earth is covered with a granite sand and huge irregular masses of stone,
among which a few plants [[force]] their [[growth]], and give the appearance of
a green field covered with the ruins of a vast edifice. these stones and
this sand discover, on examination, a [[perfect]] analogy with those which
compose the arid and broken summits of the rocky mountains. the flood
of waters which washed the soil to the bottom of the valley afterwards
carried away portions of the rocks themselves; and these, dashed and
bruised against the neighboring cliffs, were left scattered like wrecks
at their feet. *d the valley of the mississippi is, upon the whole, the
most magnificent dwelling-place prepared by [[god]] for man's [[man]] abode; and yet
it may be said that at [[present]] it is but a mighty desert.

[footnote d: see appendix, a.]


on the eastern side of the alleghanies, between the base of these
mountains and the atlantic ocean, there lies [[lie]] a long ridge of rocks and
sand, which the sea appears to have left behind as it retired. the mean
breadth of this territory does not exceed one hundred miles; but it is
about nine hundred miles in length. this part of the american continent
has a soil which offers every obstacle to the husbandman, and its
vegetation is scanty and unvaried.

upon this inhospitable coast the first [[united]] efforts of [[human]] industry
were made. the tongue of arid [[land]] was the cradle of those english
colonies which were destined one day to become the [[united]] states of
america. the centre of [[power]] still remains here; whilst in the backwoods
the true elements of the [[great]] [[people]] to whom the future control of the
continent belongs are gathering almost in secrecy together.

when the europeans [[european]] first landed on the shores of the west indies,
and afterwards on the coast of south [[america]], they [[thought]] themselves
transported into those fabulous regions of which poets had sung. the sea
sparkled with phosphoric [[light]], and the extraordinary transparency of
its waters discovered to the view of the navigator all that had hitherto
been hidden in the deep abyss. *e here and there appeared little islands
perfumed with odoriferous plants, and resembling baskets of flowers
floating on the tranquil surface of the ocean. every object which met
the sight, in this enchanting region, seemed prepared to satisfy the
wants or contribute to the pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[man]]. almost all the trees were
loaded with nourishing fruits, and those which were useless as food
delighted the eye by the brilliancy and variety of their colors. in
groves of fragrant lemon-trees, wild figs, flowering myrtles, acacias,
and oleanders, which were hung with festoons of various climbing plants,
covered with flowers, a multitude of birds unknown in [[europe]] displayed
their bright plumage, glittering with purple and azure, and mingled
their warbling with the harmony of a [[world]] teeming with [[life]] and motion.
*f underneath this brilliant exterior [[death]] was concealed. but the air
of these climates had so enervating an influence that [[man]], absorbed by
present enjoyment, was rendered regardless of the future.

[footnote e: malte brun tells us (vol. v. p. 726) that the water of the
caribbean sea is so transparent that corals and fish are discernible at
a depth of sixty fathoms. the ship seemed to float in air, the navigator
became giddy as his eye penetrated through the crystal flood, and beheld
submarine gardens, or beds of shells, or gilded fishes gliding among
tufts and thickets of seaweed.]

[footnote f: see appendix, b.]

north [[america]] appeared under a very different aspect; there everything
was grave, serious, and solemn: it seemed created to be the domain of
intelligence, as the south was that of sensual delight. a turbulent and
foggy ocean washed its shores. it was girt round by a belt of granite
rocks, or by wide tracts of sand. the foliage of its woods was dark and
gloomy, for they were composed of firs, larches, evergreen oaks, wild
olive-trees, and laurels. beyond this outer belt lay the thick shades
of the central forest, where the largest trees which are produced in
the two hemispheres grow side by side. the plane, the catalpa, the
sugar-maple, and the virginian poplar mingled their branches with those
of the oak, the beech, and the lime. in these, as in the forests of the
old [[world]], destruction was perpetually going on. the ruins of vegetation
were heaped upon each other; but there was no laboring hand to remove
them, and their decay was not rapid enough to make room for the
continual [[work]] of reproduction. climbing plants, grasses, and other
herbs forced their way through the mass of dying trees; they crept along
their bending trunks, found nourishment in their dusty cavities, and
a passage beneath the lifeless bark. thus decay gave its assistance to
life, and their respective productions were mingled together. the depths
of these forests were gloomy and obscure, and a thousand rivulets,
undirected in their course by [[human]] industry, preserved in them a
constant moisture. it was rare to meet with flowers, wild fruits, or
birds beneath their shades. the fall of a tree overthrown by [[age]],
the rushing torrent of a cataract, the lowing of the buffalo, and the
howling of the wind were the only sounds which broke the [[silence]] of
nature.

to the east of the [[great]] river, the woods almost disappeared; in their
stead were seen prairies of immense extent. whether [[nature]] in her
infinite variety had denied the germs of trees to these fertile plains,
or whether they had once been covered with forests, subsequently
destroyed by the hand of [[man]], is a [[question]] which neither tradition nor
scientific research has been able to resolve.

these immense deserts were not, however, devoid of [[human]] inhabitants.
some wandering tribes had been for ages [[age]] scattered among the forest
shades or the green pastures of the prairie. from the mouth of the st.
lawrence to the delta of the mississippi, and from the atlantic to the
pacific ocean, these savages possessed [[certain]] points of resemblance
which bore witness of their [[common]] origin; but at the same [[time]] they
differed from all other known races [[race]] of [[men]]: *g they were neither white
like the europeans [[european]], nor yellow like most of the asiatics, nor black like
the negroes. their skin was reddish brown, their hair long and shining,
their lips thin, and their cheekbones very prominent. the languages
spoken by the north american tribes are various as far as regarded their
words, but they were [[subject]] to the same grammatical rules [[rule]]. these rules
differed in several points from such as had been observed to govern the
origin of [[language]]. the idiom of the americans seemed to be the product
of new combinations, and bespoke an effort of the understanding of which
the indians [[indian]] of our days would be incapable. *h

[footnote g: with the [[progress]] of discovery some resemblance has been
found to [[exist]] between the physical conformation, the [[language]], and
the habits of the indians [[indian]] of north [[america]], and those of the tongous,
mantchous, mongols, tartars, and other wandering tribes of [[asia]]. the
land occupied by these tribes is not very distant from behring's strait,
which allows of the supposition, that at a remote period they gave
inhabitants to the desert continent of [[america]]. but this is a point
which has not yet been clearly elucidated by [[science]]. see malte brun,
vol. v.; the works [[work]] of humboldt; fischer, "conjecture sur l'origine des
americains"; adair, "history of the american indians [[indian]]."]

[footnote h: see appendix, c.]

the social [[state]] of these tribes differed also in many respects [[respect]] from all
that was seen in the old [[world]]. they seemed to have multiplied freely
in the midst of their deserts without coming in contact with other races
more civilized than their own. accordingly, they exhibited none of those
indistinct, incoherent notions of [[right]] and [[wrong]], none of that deep
corruption of manners, which is usually joined with ignorance and
rudeness among nations which, after advancing to [[civilization]], have
relapsed into a [[state]] of barbarism. the [[indian]] was indebted to no one
but himself; his virtues [[virtue]], his vices [[vice]], and his prejudices were his own
work; he had grown up in the wild independence of his [[nature]].

if, in polished countries [[country]], the lowest of the [[people]] are rude and
uncivil, it is not merely because they are [[poor]] and ignorant, but that,
being so, they are in daily contact with [[rich]] and enlightened [[men]].
the sight of their own hard lot and of their weakness, which is
daily contrasted with the [[happiness]] and [[power]] of some of their
fellow-creatures, excites in their hearts [[heart]] at the same [[time]] the
sentiments of anger and of [[fear]]: the [[consciousness]] of their inferiority
and of their dependence irritates while it humiliates them. this state
of [[mind]] displays itself in their manners and [[language]]; they are at once
insolent and servile. the [[truth]] of this is easily proved by observation;
the [[people]] are more rude in aristocratic countries [[country]] than elsewhere, in
opulent cities [[city]] than in rural districts. in those places where the rich
and powerful are assembled together the [[weak]] and the indigent feel
themselves [[oppressed]] by their inferior condition. unable to perceive a
single [[chance]] of regaining their equality, they give up to despair, and
allow themselves to fall below the [[dignity]] of [[human]] [[nature]].

this unfortunate effect of the disparity of conditions is not observable
in savage [[life]]: the indians [[indian]], although they are ignorant and [[poor]], are
equal and [[free]]. at the period when europeans [[european]] first came among them
the natives of north [[america]] were ignorant of the value of riches [[rich]], and
indifferent to the enjoyments which civilized [[man]] procures to himself
by their means. nevertheless there was nothing coarse in their
demeanor; they practised an habitual reserve and a [[kind]] of aristocratic
politeness. mild and hospitable when at [[peace]], though merciless in
war beyond any known [[degree]] of [[human]] ferocity, the [[indian]] would expose
himself to [[die]] of [[hunger]] in order to succor the stranger who asked
admittance by night at the door of his hut; yet he could tear in pieces
with his hands the still quivering limbs of his [[prisoner]]. the famous
republics of antiquity never gave examples [[example]] of more unshaken [[courage]],
more haughty spirits, or more intractable [[love]] of independence than were
hidden in former times [[time]] among the wild forests of the new [[world]]. *i the
europeans produced no [[great]] impression when they landed upon the shores
of north [[america]]; their presence engendered neither envy nor [[fear]]. what
influence could they possess over such [[men]] as we have described? the
indian could [[live]] without wants, suffer without complaint, and pour out
his death-song at the stake. *j like all the other members of the great
human [[family]], these savages believed in the existence of a [[better]] [[world]],
and adored under different names, [[god]], the creator of the [[universe]].
their notions on the [[great]] intellectual truths [[truth]] were in general simple
and philosophical. *k

[footnote i: we learn from president jefferson's "notes upon virginia,"
p. 148, that among the iroquois, when attacked by a superior [[force]], aged
men refused to fly or to survive the destruction of their [[country]]; and
they braved [[death]] like the ancient romans when their [[capital]] was sacked
by the gauls. further on, p. 150, he tells us that there is no example
of an [[indian]] who, having fallen into the hands of his enemies [[enemy]], begged
for his [[life]]; on the contrary, the captive sought to obtain [[death]] at the
hands of his conquerors by the use of insult and provocation.]

[footnote j: see "histoire de la louisiane," by lepage dupratz;
charlevoix, "histoire de la nouvelle france"; "lettres du rev. g.
hecwelder;" "transactions of the american philosophical [[society]]," v. i;
jefferson's "notes on virginia," pp. 135-190. what is said by jefferson
is of especial weight, on account of the personal [[merit]] of the writer,
of his peculiar position, and of the matter-of-fact [[age]] in which he
lived.]

[footnote k: see appendix, d.]

although we have here traced the [[character]] of a primitive [[people]], yet it
cannot be doubted that another [[people]], more civilized and more advanced
in all respects [[respect]], had preceded it in the same regions.

an obscure tradition which prevailed among the indians [[indian]] to the north of
the atlantic informs us that these very tribes formerly dwelt on
the west side of the mississippi. along the banks of the ohio, and
throughout the central valley, there are frequently found, at this day,
tumuli raised by the hands of [[men]]. on exploring these heaps of [[earth]] to
their centre, it is usual to meet with [[human]] bones, [[strange]] instruments,
arms and utensils of all kinds [[kind]], made of metal, or destined for purposes
unknown to the [[present]] [[race]]. the indians [[indian]] of our [[time]] are unable to give
any information relative to the [[history]] of this unknown [[people]]. neither
did those who lived three hundred years ago, when [[america]] was first
discovered, leave any accounts from which even an hypothesis could be
formed. tradition--that perishable, yet ever renewed monument of the
pristine world--throws no [[light]] upon the [[subject]]. it is an undoubted
fact, however, that in this part of the globe thousands of our
fellow-beings had lived. when they came hither, what was their origin,
their [[destiny]], their [[history]], and how they perished, no one can tell.
how [[strange]] does it appear that nations have existed, and afterwards so
completely disappeared from the [[earth]] that the remembrance of their very
names is effaced; their languages [[language]] are lost; their [[glory]] is vanished like
a sound without an echo; though perhaps there is not one which has not
left behind it some tomb in memory of its passage! the most durable
monument of [[human]] labor is that which recalls the wretchedness and
nothingness of [[man]].

although the vast [[country]] which we have been describing was inhabited
by many indigenous tribes, it may justly be said at the [[time]] of its
discovery by europeans [[european]] to have formed one [[great]] desert. the indians
occupied without possessing it. it is by agricultural labor that man
appropriates the soil, and the early inhabitants of north america
lived by the [[produce]] of the chase. their implacable prejudices, their
uncontrolled [[passions]], their vices [[vice]], and still more perhaps their savage
virtues, consigned them to inevitable destruction. the ruin of these
nations began from the day when europeans [[european]] landed on their shores; it has
proceeded ever since, and we are now witnessing the completion of it.
they seem to have been placed by providence amidst the riches [[rich]] of the new
world to enjoy them for a season, and then [[surrender]] them. those coasts,
so admirably adapted for commerce and industry; those wide and deep
rivers; that inexhaustible valley of the mississippi; the whole
continent, in short, seemed prepared to be the abode of a [[great]] nation,
yet unborn.

in that [[land]] the [[great]] experiment was to be made, by civilized [[man]], of
the attempt to construct [[society]] upon a new basis; and it was there, for
the first [[time]], that theories hitherto unknown, or deemed impracticable,
were to exhibit a spectacle for which the [[world]] had not been prepared by
the [[history]] of the [[past]].

social condition and their laws--america the only [[country]] in which the
starting-point of a [[great]] [[people]] has been clearly observable--in what
respects all who emigrated to british [[america]] were similar--in what they

spirit--intimate union of the spirit of [[religion]] with the spirit of
liberty.

origin of the anglo-americans, and its importance in relation to their
future condition.

after the birth of a [[human]] being his early years are obscurely spent in
the toils or pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[childhood]]. as he grows up the [[world]] receives
him, when his manhood begins, and he enters into contact with his
fellows. he is then [[studied]] for the first [[time]], and it is imagined
that the germ of the vices [[vice]] and the virtues [[virtue]] of his maturer years is then
formed. this, if i am not mistaken, is a [[great]] error. we must begin
higher up; we must watch the infant in its mother's arms; we must see
the first images which the external [[world]] casts upon the dark mirror
of his [[mind]]; the first occurrences which he witnesses; we must hear the
first words which awaken the sleeping powers [[power]] of [[thought]], and stand by
his earliest efforts, if we would [[understand]] the prejudices, the habits,
and the [[passions]] which will [[rule]] his [[life]]. the entire [[man]] is, so to
speak, to be seen in the cradle of the child.

the [[growth]] of nations presents [[present]] something analogous to this: they all
bear some marks of their origin; and the circumstances which accompanied
their birth and contributed to their rise affect the whole term of their
being. if we were able to go back to the elements of states, and to
examine the oldest monuments of their [[history]], i [[doubt]] not that we
should discover the primal cause of the prejudices, the habits, the
ruling [[passions]], and, in short, of all that constitutes what is called
the national [[character]]; we should then find the explanation of certain
customs which now seem at variance with the prevailing manners; of such
laws as conflict with established principles [[principle]]; and of such incoherent
opinions as are here and there to be met with in [[society]], like those
fragments of broken chains which we sometimes see hanging from the vault
of an edifice, and supporting nothing. this might explain the destinies
of [[certain]] nations, which seem borne on by an unknown [[force]] to ends of
which they themselves are ignorant. but hitherto facts [[fact]] have been wanting
to researches of this [[kind]]: the spirit of inquiry has only come upon
communities in their latter days; and when they at length contemplated
their origin, [[time]] had already obscured it, or ignorance and pride
adorned it with truth-concealing fables.

america is the only [[country]] in which it has been possible to witness
the [[natural]] and tranquil [[growth]] of [[society]], and where the influences
exercised on the future condition of states by their origin is clearly
distinguishable. at the period when the peoples [[people]] of [[europe]] landed in the
new [[world]] their national characteristics were already completely formed;
each of them had a physiognomy of its own; and as they had already
attained that stage of [[civilization]] at which [[men]] are [[led]] to study
themselves, they have transmitted to us a faithful picture of their
opinions, their manners, and their laws [[law]]. the [[men]] of the sixteenth
century are almost as well known to us as our contemporaries. [[america]],
consequently, exhibits in the broad [[light]] of day the phenomena which the
ignorance or rudeness of earlier ages [[age]] conceals from our researches.
near enough to the [[time]] when the states of [[america]] were founded, to be
accurately acquainted with their elements, and sufficiently removed from
that period to [[judge]] of some of their results, the [[men]] of our own day
seem destined to see further than their predecessors into the series of
human events. providence has given us a torch which our forefathers did
not possess, and has allowed us to discern fundamental causes in the
history of the [[world]] which the obscurity of the [[past]] concealed from
them. if we carefully examine the social and [[political]] [[state]] of [[america]],
after having [[studied]] its [[history]], we shall remain perfectly convinced
that not an [[opinion]], not a custom, not a [[law]], i may even say not an
event, is upon record which the origin of that [[people]] will not explain.
the readers of this [[book]] will find the germ of all that is to [[follow]] in
the [[present]] [[chapter]], and the key to almost the whole [[work]].

the emigrants who came, at different periods to occupy the territory now
covered by the american union differed from each other in many respects [[respect]];
their aim was not the same, and they governed themselves on different
principles. these [[men]] had, however, [[certain]] features in [[common]], and
they were all placed in an analogous situation. the tie of [[language]] is
perhaps the strongest and the most durable that can unite [[mankind]]. all
the emigrants spoke the same tongue; they were all offsets from the same
people. born in a [[country]] which had been agitated for centuries by the
struggles of faction, and in which all parties had been obliged in
their turn to place themselves under the protection of the laws [[law]], their
political [[education]] had been perfected in this rude school, and they
were more conversant with the notions of [[right]] and the principles [[principle]] of
true [[freedom]] than the greater part of their [[european]] contemporaries. at
the period of their first emigrations the parish [[system]], that fruitful
germ of [[free]] [[institutions]], was deeply rooted in the habits of the
english; and with it the doctrine of the sovereignty of the [[people]] had
been introduced into the bosom of the [[monarchy]] of the house of tudor.

the [[religious]] quarrels which have agitated the [[christian]] [[world]] were then
rife. [[england]] had plunged into the new order of things with headlong
vehemence. the [[character]] of its inhabitants, which had always been
sedate and reflective, became argumentative and austere. general
information had been increased by intellectual debate, and the mind
had received a deeper cultivation. whilst [[religion]] was the topic of
discussion, the morals [[moral]] of the [[people]] were reformed. all these national
features are more or less discoverable in the physiognomy of those
adventurers who came to seek a new [[home]] on the opposite shores of the
atlantic.

another remark, to which we shall hereafter have [[occasion]] to recur, is
applicable not only to the english, but to the french, the spaniards,
and all the europeans [[european]] who successively established themselves in the new
world. all these [[european]] colonies contained the elements, if not the
development, of a complete [[democracy]]. two causes [[led]] to this result. it
may safely be advanced, that on leaving the mother-country the emigrants
had in general no notion of superiority over one another. the [[happy]] and
the powerful do not go into [[exile]], and there are no surer guarantees of
equality among [[men]] than [[poverty]] and misfortune. it happened, however,
on several occasions [[occasion]], that persons [[person]] of rank were driven to america
by [[political]] and [[religious]] quarrels. laws [[law]] were made to establish a
gradation of ranks; but it was soon found that the soil of [[america]] was
opposed to a territorial [[aristocracy]]. to bring that refractory [[land]] into
cultivation, the constant and interested exertions of the owner himself
were necessary; and when the ground was prepared, its [[produce]] was found
to be insufficient to enrich a master and a [[farmer]] at the same [[time]].
the [[land]] was then naturally broken up into small portions, which the
proprietor cultivated for himself. [[land]] is the basis of an [[aristocracy]],
which clings to the soil that supports it; for it is not by privileges
alone, nor by birth, but by landed [[property]] handed down from generation
to [[generation]], that an [[aristocracy]] is constituted. a nation may present
immense fortunes [[fortune]] and extreme wretchedness, but unless those fortunes [[fortune]] are
territorial there is no [[aristocracy]], but simply the class of the rich
and that of the [[poor]].

all the british colonies had then a [[great]] [[degree]] of similarity at the
epoch of their settlement. all of them, from their first beginning,
seemed destined to witness the [[growth]], not of the aristocratic liberty
of their mother-country, but of that [[freedom]] of the middle and lower
orders of which the [[history]] of the [[world]] had as yet furnished no
complete [[example]].

in this general uniformity several striking differences were however
discernible, which it is necessary to point out. two branches may be
distinguished in the anglo-american [[family]], which have hitherto grown
up without entirely commingling; the one in the south, the other in the
north.

virginia received the first english colony; the emigrants took
possession of it in 1607. the [[idea]] that mines of gold and silver are
the sources of national [[wealth]] was at that [[time]] singularly prevalent in
europe; a fatal delusion, which has done more to impoverish the nations
which adopted it, and has cost more lives [[life]] in [[america]], than the united
influence of [[war]] and [[bad]] laws [[law]]. the [[men]] sent to virginia *a were seekers
of gold, adventurers, without resources and without [[character]], whose
turbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony, *b and
rendered its [[progress]] uncertain. the artisans and agriculturists arrived
afterwards; and, although they were a more [[moral]] and orderly [[race]] of
men, they were in nowise above the level of the inferior classes in
england. *c no lofty conceptions, no intellectual [[system]], directed the
foundation of these new settlements. the colony was scarcely established
when [[slavery]] was introduced, *d and this was the main circumstance which
has exercised so prodigious an influence on the [[character]], the laws [[law]], and
all the future prospects of the south. [[slavery]], as we shall afterwards
show, dishonors labor; it introduces idleness into [[society]], and with
idleness, ignorance and [[pride]], luxury and distress. it enervates the
powers of the [[mind]], and benumbs the activity of [[man]]. the influence of
slavery, [[united]] to the english [[character]], explains the manners and the
social condition of the southern states.

[footnote a: the charter granted by the [[crown]] of [[england]] in 1609
stipulated, amongst other conditions, that the adventurers should pay
to the [[crown]] a fifth of the [[produce]] of all gold and silver mines. see
marshall's "life of washington," vol. i. pp. 18-66.] [footnote b: a
large portion of the adventurers, says stith ("history of virginia"),
were unprincipled [[young]] [[men]] of [[family]], whom their parents were glad to
ship off, discharged servants, fraudulent bankrupts, or debauchees; and
others of the same class, [[people]] more apt to pillage and [[destroy]] than
to assist the settlement, were the seditious chiefs [[chief]], who easily [[led]] this
band into every [[kind]] of extravagance and excess. see for the [[history]] of
virginia the following works [[work]]:--

"history of virginia, from the first settlements in the year 1624," by
smith.

"history of virginia," by william stith.

"history of virginia, from the earliest period," by beverley.]

[footnote c: it was not till some [[time]] later that a [[certain]] number of
rich english capitalists came to fix themselves in the colony.]

[footnote d: [[slavery]] was introduced about the year 1620 by a dutch
vessel which landed twenty negroes on the banks of the river james. see
chalmer.]

in the north, the same english foundation was modified by the most
opposite shades of [[character]]; and here i may be allowed to enter into
some details. the two or three main ideas [[idea]] which constitute the basis
of the social theory of the [[united]] states were first combined in the
northern english colonies, more generally denominated the states of
new [[england]]. *e the principles [[principle]] of new [[england]] spread at first to the
neighboring states; they then passed successively to the more distant
ones; and at length they imbued the whole confederation. they now extend
their influence beyond its limits over the whole american [[world]]. the
civilization of new [[england]] has been like a beacon lit upon a hill,
which, after it has diffused its warmth around, tinges the distant
horizon with its glow.

[footnote e: the states of new [[england]] are those situated to the east of
the hudson; they are now six in number: 1, connecticut; 2, rhode island;
3, massachusetts; 4, vermont; 5, new hampshire; 6, maine.]

the foundation of new [[england]] was a novel spectacle, and all the
circumstances attending it were singular and original. the large
majority of colonies have been first inhabited either by [[men]] without
education and without resources, driven by their [[poverty]] and their
misconduct from the [[land]] which gave them birth, or by speculators
and adventurers greedy of gain. some settlements cannot even boast so
honorable an origin; st. domingo was founded by buccaneers; and the
criminal courts of [[england]] originally supplied the [[population]] of
australia.

the settlers who established themselves on the shores of new [[england]] all
belonged to the more independent classes of their native [[country]]. their
union on the soil of [[america]] at once presented the singular phenomenon
of a [[society]] containing neither lords [[lord]] nor [[common]] [[people]], neither rich
nor [[poor]]. these [[men]] possessed, in proportion to their number, a greater
mass of [[intelligence]] than is to be found in any [[european]] nation of
our own [[time]]. all, without a [[single]] exception, had received a good
education, and many of them were known in [[europe]] for their [[talents]] and
their acquirements. the other colonies had been founded by adventurers
without [[family]]; the emigrants of new [[england]] brought with them the best
elements of order and morality--they landed in the desert accompanied
by their wives [[wife]] and [[children]]. but what most especially distinguished them
was the aim of their undertaking. they had not been obliged by necessity
to leave their [[country]]; the social position they abandoned was one to
be regretted, and their means of subsistence were [[certain]]. nor did
they cross the atlantic to improve their situation or to increase their
wealth; the call which summoned them from the comforts of their homes
was purely intellectual; and in facing the inevitable sufferings of
exile their object was the triumph of an [[idea]].

the emigrants, or, as they deservedly styled themselves, the pilgrims,
belonged to that english sect the austerity of whose principles [[principle]] had
acquired for them the name of puritans. puritanism was not merely a
religious doctrine, but it corresponded in many points with the most
absolute democratic and republican theories. it was this tendency which
had aroused its most dangerous adversaries. persecuted by the government
of the mother-country, and disgusted by the habits of a [[society]] opposed
to the rigor of their own principles [[principle]], the puritans went forth to seek
some rude and unfrequented part of the [[world]], where they could live
according to their own opinions [[opinion]], and [[worship]] [[god]] in [[freedom]].

a few quotations will throw more [[light]] upon the spirit of these pious
adventures than all we can say of them. nathaniel morton, *f the
historian of the first years of the settlement, thus opens his [[subject]]:

[footnote f: "new england's memorial," p. 13; boston, 1826. see also
"hutchinson's [[history]]," vol. ii. p. 440.]

"gentle reader,--i have for some length of [[time]] looked upon it as a duty
incumbent, especially on the immediate successors of those that have had
so large [[experience]] of those many memorable and signal demonstrations
of god's goodness, viz., the first beginners of this plantation in new
england, to commit to writing his gracious dispensations on that
behalf; having so many inducements thereunto, not onely otherwise but
so plentifully in the [[sacred]] scriptures [[scripture]]: that so, what we have seen,
and what our fathers [[father]] have told us (psalm lxxviii. 3, 4), we may not hide
from our [[children]], showing to the generations [[generation]] to come the praises [[praise]] of the
lord; that especially the seed of [[abraham]] his servant, and the children
of jacob his chosen (psalm cv. 5, 6), may [[remember]] his marvellous
works in the beginning and [[progress]] of the planting of new [[england]], his
wonders and the judgments [[judgment]] of his mouth; how that [[god]] brought a vine into
this wilderness; that he cast out the heathen, and planted it; that he
made room for it and caused it to take deep root; and it filled the land
(psalm lxxx. 8, 9). and not onely so, but also that he hath guided his
people by his [[strength]] to his holy habitation and planted them in the
mountain of his [[inheritance]] in [[respect]] of precious gospel enjoyments:
and that as especially [[god]] may have the [[glory]] of all unto whom it
is most due; so also some rays of [[glory]] may reach the names of those
blessed saints that were the main instruments and the beginning of this
happy enterprise."

it is impossible to [[read]] this opening paragraph without an involuntary
feeling of [[religious]] awe; it breathes the very savor of gospel
antiquity. the sincerity of the author heightens his [[power]] of [[language]].
the band which to his [[eyes]] was a mere party of adventurers gone forth
to seek their [[fortune]] beyond seas appears to the reader as the germ of a
great nation wafted by providence to a predestined shore.

the author thus continues his narrative of the departure of the first
pilgrims:--

"so they left that goodly and pleasant [[city]] of leyden, *g which had been
their resting-place for above eleven years; but they knew that they were
pilgrims and strangers here below, and looked not much on these things,
but lifted up their [[eyes]] to [[heaven]], their dearest [[country]], where god
hath prepared for them a [[city]] (heb. xi. 16), and therein quieted their
spirits. when they came to delfs-haven they found the ship and all
things ready; and such of their [[friends]] as could not come with them
followed after them, and sundry came from amsterdam to see them shipt,
and to take their leaves of them. one night was spent with little sleep
with the most, but with friendly entertainment and [[christian]] discourse,
and other real expressions of true [[christian]] [[love]]. the next day they
went on board, and their [[friends]] with them, where truly doleful was the
sight of that [[sad]] and mournful parting, to hear what sighs and sobs and
prayers did sound amongst them; what tears did gush from every eye,
and pithy speeches [[speech]] pierced each other's [[heart]], that sundry of the dutch
strangers that stood on the key as spectators could not refrain from
tears. but the tide (which stays for no man) calling them away, that
were thus loth to depart, their reverend pastor falling down on his
knees, and they all with him, with watery cheeks commended them with
most fervent prayers unto the [[lord]] and his blessing; and then, with
mutual embraces and many tears they took their leaves one of another,
which proved to be the [[last]] leave to many of them."

[footnote g: the emigrants were, for the most part, godly christians
from the north of [[england]], who had quitted their native [[country]] because
they were "studious of reformation, and entered into covenant to walk
with one another according to the primitive pattern of the word of [[god]]."
they emigrated to holland, and settled in the [[city]] of leyden in 1610,
where they abode, being lovingly respected by the dutch, for many years:
they left it in 1620 for several reasons [[reason]], the [[last]] of which was, that
their [[posterity]] would in a few generations [[generation]] become dutch, and so lose
their interest in the english nation; they being desirous rather
to enlarge his majesty's dominions, and to [[live]] under their natural
prince.--translator's note.]

the emigrants were about 150 in number, including the [[women]] and the
children. their object was to plant a colony on the shores of the
hudson; but after having been driven about for some [[time]] in the atlantic
ocean, they were forced to [[land]] on that arid coast of new [[england]] which
is now the site of the town of plymouth. the rock is still shown on
which the pilgrims disembarked. *h

[footnote h: this rock is become an object of veneration in the united
states. i have seen bits of it carefully preserved in several towns of
the union. does not this sufficiently show how entirely all [[human]] power
and greatness is in the [[soul]] of [[man]]? here is a stone which the feet of
a few outcasts pressed for an instant, and this stone becomes famous; it
is treasured by a [[great]] nation, its very dust is shared as a relic: and
what is become of the gateways of a thousand palaces?]

"but before we pass on," continues our historian, "let the reader
with me make a pause and seriously consider this [[poor]] people's present
condition, the more to be raised up to admiration of god's goodness
towards them in their preservation: for being now passed the vast
ocean, and a sea of troubles before them in expectation, they had now
no [[friends]] to welcome them, no inns to entertain or refresh them, no
houses, or much less towns to repair unto to seek for succour: and for
the season it was winter, and they that [[know]] the winters of the country
know them to be sharp and [[violent]], [[subject]] to cruel and fierce storms,
dangerous to travel to known places, much more to search unknown coasts.
besides, what could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness, full
of wilde beasts, and wilde [[men]]? and what multitudes of them there were,
they then knew not: for which way soever they turned their [[eyes]] (save
upward to heaven) they could have but little solace or content in
respect of any outward object; for summer being ended, all things stand
in appearance with a weather-beaten face, and the whole [[country]] full of
woods and thickets, represented a wild and savage hew; if they looked
behind them, there was the mighty ocean which they had passed, and was
now as a main bar or gulph to separate them from all the civil parts of
the [[world]]."

it must not be imagined that the piety of the puritans was of a merely
speculative [[kind]], or that it took no cognizance of the course of worldly
affairs. puritanism, as i have already remarked, was scarcely less a
political than a [[religious]] doctrine. no sooner had the emigrants landed
on the barren coast described by nathaniel morton than it was their
first [[care]] to constitute a [[society]], by passing the following act:

"in the name of [[god]]. amen. we, whose names are underwritten, the loyal
subjects of our dread [[sovereign]] [[lord]] [[king]] james, etc., etc., having
undertaken for the [[glory]] of [[god]], and advancement of the [[christian]] [[faith]],
and the [[honour]] of our [[king]] and [[country]], a [[voyage]] to plant the first
colony in the northern parts of virginia; do by these presents [[present]] solemnly
and mutually, in the presence of [[god]] and one another, covenant and
combine ourselves together into a civil [[body]] politick, for our better
ordering and preservation, and furtherance of the ends aforesaid: and by
virtue hereof do enact, constitute and frame such just and [[equal]] laws [[law]],
ordinances, acts, constitutions [[constitution]], and officers, from [[time]] to [[time]], as
shall be [[thought]] most meet and convenient for the general [[good]] of the
colony: unto which we promise all due submission and [[obedience]]," etc. *i

[footnote i: the emigrants who founded the [[state]] of rhode island in
1638, those who landed at new haven in 1637, the first settlers in
connecticut in 1639, and the founders of providence in 1640, began in
like manner by drawing up a social contract, which was acceded to by all
the interested parties. see "pitkin's [[history]]," pp. 42 and 47.]

this happened in 1620, and from that [[time]] forwards the emigration went
on. the [[religious]] and [[political]] [[passions]] which ravaged the british
empire during the whole reign of charles i drove fresh crowds of
sectarians every year to the shores of [[america]]. in [[england]] the
stronghold of puritanism was in the middle classes, and it was from the
middle classes that the majority of the emigrants came. the population
of new [[england]] increased rapidly; and whilst the hierarchy of rank
despotically classed the inhabitants of the mother-country, the colony
continued to [[present]] the novel spectacle of a [[community]] homogeneous in
all its parts. a [[democracy]], more [[perfect]] than any which antiquity had
dreamt of, started in full size and panoply from the midst of an ancient
feudal [[society]].




chapter ii: origin of the anglo-americans--part ii


the english [[government]] was not dissatisfied with an emigration which
removed the elements of fresh discord and of further revolutions [[revolution]]. on the
contrary, everything was done to encourage it, and [[great]] exertions were
made to mitigate the hardships of those who sought a shelter from the
rigor of their country's laws [[law]] on the soil of [[america]]. it seemed as
if new [[england]] was a region given up to the dreams [[dream]] of fancy and the
unrestrained experiments of innovators.

the english colonies (and this is one of the main causes of their
prosperity) have always enjoyed more internal [[freedom]] and more political
independence than the colonies of other nations; but this [[principle]] of
liberty was nowhere more extensively applied than in the states of new
england.

it was generally allowed at that period that the territories of the
new [[world]] belonged to that [[european]] nation which had been the first to
discover them. nearly the whole coast of north [[america]] thus became a
british possession towards the end of the sixteenth century. the means
used by the english [[government]] to [[people]] these new domains were of
several kinds [[kind]]; the [[king]] sometimes appointed a governor of his own
choice, who ruled a portion of the new [[world]] in the name and under the
immediate orders of the [[crown]]; *j this is the colonial [[system]] adopted by
other countries [[country]] of [[europe]]. sometimes grants of [[certain]] tracts were made
by the [[crown]] to an [[individual]] or to a company, *k in which case all the
civil and [[political]] [[power]] fell into the hands of one or more persons [[person]],
who, under the inspection and control of the [[crown]], sold the lands [[land]] and
governed the inhabitants. lastly, a third [[system]] consisted in allowing a
certain number of emigrants to constitute a [[political]] [[society]] under the
protection of the mother-country, and to govern themselves in whatever
was not contrary to her laws [[law]]. this mode of colonization, so remarkably
favorable to [[liberty]], was only adopted in new [[england]]. *l

[footnote j: this was the case in the [[state]] of new york.]

[footnote k: maryland, the carolinas, pennsylvania, and new jersey were
in this situation. see "pitkin's [[history]]," vol. i. pp. 11-31.]

[footnote l: see the [[work]] entitled "historical collection of state
papers and other authentic documents intended as materials for a history
of the [[united]] states of [[america]], by ebenezer hasard. philadelphia,
1792," for a [[great]] number of documents relating to the commencement
of the colonies, which are valuable from their contents and their
authenticity: amongst them are the various charters granted by the king
of [[england]], and the first acts of the local governments [[government]].

see also the analysis of all these charters given by mr. story, judge
of the supreme court of the [[united]] states, in the introduction to his
"commentary on the [[constitution]] of the [[united]] states." it results from
these documents that the principles [[principle]] of representative [[government]] and
the external forms of [[political]] [[liberty]] were introduced into all the
colonies at their origin. these principles [[principle]] were more fully acted upon in
the north than in the south, but they existed everywhere.]

in 1628 *m a charter of this [[kind]] was granted by charles i to the
emigrants who went to form the colony of massachusetts. but, in general,
charters were not given to the colonies of new [[england]] till they had
acquired a [[certain]] existence. plymouth, providence, new haven, the state
of connecticut, and that of rhode island *n were founded without the
co-operation and almost without the [[knowledge]] of the mother-country.
the new settlers did not derive their incorporation from the seat of
the [[empire]], although they did not deny its [[supremacy]]; they constituted
a [[society]] of their own accord, and it was not till thirty or forty
years afterwards, under charles ii. that their existence was legally
recognized by a [[royal]] charter.

[footnote m: see "pitkin's [[history]]," p, 35. see the "history of the
colony of massachusetts bay," by hutchinson, vol. i. p. 9.] [footnote n:
see "pitkin's [[history]]," pp. 42, 47.]

this frequently renders its it difficult to detect the link which
connected the emigrants with the [[land]] of their forefathers in studying
the earliest historical and legislative records of new [[england]]. they
exercised the rights [[right]] of sovereignty; they named their magistrates,
concluded [[peace]] or declared [[war]], made [[police]] regulations, and enacted
laws as if their allegiance was due only to [[god]]. *o nothing can be more
curious and, at the same [[time]] more instructive, than the legislation of
that period; it is there that the solution of the [[great]] social problem
which the [[united]] states now [[present]] to the [[world]] is to be found.

[footnote o: the inhabitants of massachusetts had deviated from the
forms which are preserved in the [[criminal]] and civil procedure of
england; in 1650 the decrees of [[justice]] were not yet headed by the royal
style. see hutchinson, vol. i. p. 452.]

amongst these documents we shall notice, as especially characteristic,
the code of laws [[law]] promulgated by the little [[state]] of connecticut in 1650.
*p the legislators of connecticut *q begin with the penal laws [[law]], and,
strange to say, they borrow their provisions from the text of holy writ.
"whosoever shall [[worship]] any other [[god]] than the [[lord]]," says the preamble
of the code, "shall surely be put to [[death]]." this is followed by ten or
twelve enactments of the same [[kind]], copied verbatim from the books [[book]] of
exodus, leviticus, and deuteronomy. blasphemy, sorcery, adultery, *r
and rape were punished with [[death]]; an outrage offered by a [[son]] to his
parents was to be expiated by the same penalty. the legislation of a
rude and half-civilized [[people]] was thus applied to an enlightened and
moral [[community]]. the consequence was that the [[punishment]] of [[death]] was
never more frequently prescribed by the statute, and never more rarely
enforced towards the guilty.

[footnote p: code of 1650, p. 28; hartford, 1830.]

[footnote q: see also in "hutchinson's [[history]]," vol. i. pp. 435,
456, the analysis of the penal code adopted in 1648 by the colony of
massachusetts: this code is drawn up on the same principles [[principle]] as that of
connecticut.]

[footnote r: adultery was also punished with [[death]] by the [[law]] of
massachusetts: and hutchinson, vol. i. p. 441, says that several persons
actually [[suffered]] for this crime. he quotes a [[curious]] anecdote on
this [[subject]], which occurred in the year 1663. a [[married]] woman had had
criminal intercourse with a [[young]] [[man]]; her husband died, and she married
the lover. several years had elapsed, when the [[public]] began to suspect
the previous intercourse of this couple: they were thrown into prison,
put upon [[trial]], and very narrowly escaped [[capital]] [[punishment]].]

the [[chief]] [[care]] of the legislators, in this [[body]] of penal laws [[law]], was the
maintenance of orderly conduct and [[good]] morals [[moral]] in the [[community]]: they
constantly invaded the domain of [[conscience]], and there was scarcely a
sin which was not [[subject]] to magisterial censure. the reader is aware of
the rigor with which these laws [[law]] punished rape and adultery; intercourse
between unmarried persons [[person]] was likewise severely repressed. the [[judge]] was
empowered to inflict a pecuniary penalty, a whipping, or [[marriage]] *s on
the misdemeanants; and if the records of the old courts of new haven may
be believed, prosecutions of this [[kind]] were not unfrequent. we find
a sentence bearing date the first of may, 1660, inflicting a fine and
reprimand on a [[young]] woman who was accused of using improper [[language]],
and of allowing herself to be kissed. *t the code of 1650 abounds in
preventive measures. it punishes idleness and drunkenness with severity.
*u innkeepers are forbidden to furnish more than a [[certain]] quantity of
liquor to each consumer; and simple lying, whenever it may be injurious,
*v is checked by a fine or a flogging. in other places, the legislator,
entirely forgetting the [[great]] principles [[principle]] of [[religious]] toleration which
he had himself upheld in [[europe]], renders attendance on [[divine]] service
compulsory, *w and goes so far as to visit with severe [[punishment]], **
and even with [[death]], the christians [[christian]] who chose to [[worship]] [[god]] according
to a ritual differing from his own. *x sometimes indeed the zeal of his
enactments induces him to descend to the most frivolous particulars:
thus a [[law]] is to be found in the same code which prohibits the use
of tobacco. *y it must not be forgotten that these fantastical and
vexatious laws [[law]] were not imposed by [[authority]], but that they were
freely voted by all the persons [[person]] interested, and that the manners of the
community were even more austere and more puritanical than the laws [[law]].
in 1649 a solemn association was formed in boston to check the worldly
luxury of long hair. *z

[footnote s: code of 1650, p. 48. it seems sometimes to have happened
that the judges [[judge]] superadded these punishments [[punishment]] to each other, as is seen
in a sentence pronounced in 1643 (p. 114, "new haven antiquities"), by
which margaret bedford, convicted of loose conduct, was condemned to be
whipped, and afterwards to [[marry]] nicholas jemmings, her accomplice.]

[footnote *: this was not peculiar to connecticut. see, for instance,
the [[law]] which, on september 13, 1644, [[banished]] the anabaptists from the
state of massachusetts. ("historical collection of [[state]] papers," vol.
i. p. 538.) see also the [[law]] against the quakers, passed on october 14,
1656: "whereas," says the preamble, "an accursed [[race]] of heretics called
quakers has sprung up," etc. the clauses of the statute inflict a
heavy fine on all captains of ships who should import quakers into
the [[country]]. the quakers who may be found there shall be whipped and
imprisoned with hard labor. those members of the sect who should defend
their opinions [[opinion]] shall be first fined, then imprisoned, and finally driven
out of the province.--"historical collection of [[state]] papers," vol. i.
p. 630.]

[footnote x: by the penal [[law]] of massachusetts, any catholic [[priest]] who
should set foot in the colony after having been once driven out of it
was liable to [[capital]] [[punishment]].]

[footnote z: "new england's memorial," p. 316. see appendix, e.]

these errors are no [[doubt]] discreditable to [[human]] [[reason]]; they attest the
inferiority of our [[nature]], which is incapable of laying firm hold upon
what is true and just, and is often reduced to the alternative of two
excesses. in strict connection with this penal legislation, which bears
such striking marks of a narrow sectarian spirit, and of those religious
passions which had been warmed by persecution and were still fermenting
among the [[people]], a [[body]] of [[political]] laws [[law]] is to be found, which, though
written two hundred years ago, is still ahead of the liberties [[liberty]] of
our [[age]]. the general principles [[principle]] which are the groundwork of modern
constitutions--principles which were imperfectly known in [[europe]], and
not completely triumphant even in [[great]] [[britain]], in the seventeenth
century--were all recognized and determined by the laws [[law]] of new [[england]]:
the intervention of the [[people]] in [[public]] affairs, the [[free]] voting of
taxes, the responsibility of authorities [[authority]], personal [[liberty]], and trial
by jury, were all positively established without discussion. from these
fruitful principles [[principle]] consequences have been derived and applications have
been made such as no nation in [[europe]] has yet ventured to attempt.

in connecticut the electoral [[body]] consisted, from its origin, of the
whole number of [[citizens]]; and this is readily to be understood, *a when
we recollect that this [[people]] enjoyed an almost [[perfect]] equality of
fortune, and a still greater uniformity of opinions [[opinion]]. *b in connecticut,
at this period, all the executive functionaries were elected, including
the governor of the [[state]]. *c the [[citizens]] above the [[age]] of sixteen were
obliged to bear arms; they formed a national militia, which appointed
its own officers, and was to hold itself at all times [[time]] in readiness to
march for the defence of the [[country]]. *d

[footnote a: [[constitution]] of 1638, p. 17.]

[footnote b: in 1641 the general assembly of rhode island unanimously
declared that the [[government]] of the [[state]] was a [[democracy]], and that the
power was vested in the [[body]] of [[free]] [[citizens]], who alone had the right
to make the laws [[law]] and to watch their execution.--code of 1650, p. 70.]

[footnote c: "pitkin's [[history]]," p. 47.]

[footnote d: [[constitution]] of 1638, p. 12.]

in the laws [[law]] of connecticut, as well as in all those of new [[england]],
we find the germ and gradual [[development]] of that township independence
which is the [[life]] and mainspring of american [[liberty]] at the present
day. the [[political]] existence of the majority of the nations of europe
commenced in the superior ranks of [[society]], and was gradually and
imperfectly communicated to the different members of the social [[body]].
in [[america]], on the other hand, it may be said that the township was
organized before the county, the county before the [[state]], the state
before the union. in new [[england]] townships were completely and
definitively constituted as early as 1650. the independence of the
township was the nucleus round which the local interests, [[passions]],
rights, and duties [[duty]] collected and clung. it gave scope to the activity
of a real [[political]] [[life]] most thoroughly democratic and republican. the
colonies still recognized the [[supremacy]] of the mother-country; monarchy
was still the [[law]] of the [[state]]; but the [[republic]] was already established
in every township. the towns named their own magistrates of every [[kind]],
rated themselves, and levied their own taxes. *e in the parish of new
england the [[law]] of representation was not adopted, but the affairs of
the [[community]] were discussed, as at [[athens]], in the market-place, by a
general assembly of the [[citizens]].

[footnote e: code of 1650, p. 80.]

in studying the laws [[law]] which were promulgated at this first era of the
american republics [[republic]], it is impossible not to be struck by the remarkable
acquaintance with the [[science]] of [[government]] and the advanced theory of
legislation which they display. the ideas [[idea]] there formed of the duties
of [[society]] towards its members are evidently much loftier and more
comprehensive than those of the [[european]] legislators at that [[time]]:
obligations were there imposed which were elsewhere slighted. in the
states of new [[england]], from the first, the condition of the [[poor]] was
provided for; *f strict measures were taken for the maintenance of
roads, and surveyors were appointed to attend to them; *g registers
were established in every parish, in which the results of public
deliberations, and the births, deaths [[death]], and marriages [[marriage]] of the citizens
were entered; *h clerks were directed to keep these registers; *i
officers were charged with the administration of vacant inheritances,
and with the arbitration of litigated landmarks; and many others were
created whose [[chief]] functions were the maintenance of [[public]] order in
the [[community]]. *j the [[law]] enters into a thousand useful provisions for
a number of social wants which are at [[present]] very inadequately [[felt]] in
france. [footnote f: ibid., p. 78.]

[footnote g: ibid., p. 49.]

[footnote h: see "hutchinson's [[history]]," vol. i. p. 455.]

[footnote i: code of 1650, p. 86.]

[footnote j: ibid., p. 40.]

but it is by the attention it pays [[pay]] to [[public]] [[education]] that the original
character of american [[civilization]] is at once placed in the clearest
light. "it being," says the [[law]], "one [[chief]] project of [[satan]] to keep
men from the [[knowledge]] of the [[scripture]] by persuading from the use of
tongues, to the end that learning may not be buried in the graves of
our forefathers, in [[church]] and commonwealth, the [[lord]] assisting our
endeavors. . . ." *k here [[follow]] clauses establishing schools in every
township, and obliging the inhabitants, under [[pain]] of heavy fines, to
support them. schools of a superior [[kind]] were founded in the same manner
in the more populous districts. the municipal authorities [[authority]] were bound to
enforce the sending of [[children]] to school by their parents; they were
empowered to inflict fines upon all who refused compliance; and in case
of continued [[resistance]] [[society]] assumed the place of the parent, took
possession of the child, and deprived the [[father]] of those [[natural]] rights
which he used to so [[bad]] a [[purpose]]. the reader will undoubtedly have
remarked the preamble of these enactments: in [[america]] [[religion]] is the
road to [[knowledge]], and the observance of the [[divine]] laws [[law]] leads [[man]] to
civil [[freedom]].

[footnote k: ibid., p. 90.]

if, after having cast a rapid glance over the [[state]] of american society
in 1650, we turn to the condition of [[europe]], and more especially to that
of the continent, at the same period, we cannot fail to be struck
with astonishment. on the continent of [[europe]], at the beginning of the
seventeenth century, absolute [[monarchy]] had everywhere triumphed over the
ruins of the oligarchical and feudal liberties [[liberty]] of the middle ages [[age]]. never
were the notions of [[right]] more completely confounded than in the midst
of the splendor and literature of [[europe]]; never was there less political
activity among the [[people]]; never were the principles [[principle]] of true freedom
less widely circulated; and at that very [[time]] those principles [[principle]], which
were scorned or unknown by the nations of [[europe]], were proclaimed in
the deserts of the new [[world]], and were accepted as the future creed of
a [[great]] [[people]]. the boldest theories of the [[human]] [[reason]] were put into
practice by a [[community]] so humble that not a statesman condescended to
attend to it; and a legislation without a precedent was produced
offhand by the [[imagination]] of the [[citizens]]. in the bosom of this
obscure [[democracy]], which had as yet brought forth neither generals, nor
philosophers, nor authors, a [[man]] might stand up in the face of a free
people and pronounce the following fine definition of [[liberty]]. *l

[footnote l: mather's "magnalia christi americana," vol. ii. p. 13.
this [[speech]] was made by winthrop; he was accused of having committed
arbitrary actions during his magistracy, but after having made
the [[speech]] of which the above is a fragment, he was acquitted by
acclamation, and from that [[time]] forwards he was always re-elected
governor of the [[state]]. see marshal, vol. i. p. 166.]

"nor would i have you to mistake in the point of your own [[liberty]].
there is a [[liberty]] of a [[corrupt]] [[nature]] which is effected both by men
and beasts to do what they list, and this [[liberty]] is inconsistent with
authority, impatient of all restraint; by this [[liberty]] 'sumus omnes
deteriores': 'tis the grand [[enemy]] of [[truth]] and [[peace]], and all the
ordinances of [[god]] are bent against it. but there is a civil, a [[moral]], a
federal [[liberty]] which is the proper end and object of [[authority]]; it is
a [[liberty]] for that only which is just and [[good]]: for this [[liberty]] you are
to stand with the hazard of your very lives [[life]] and whatsoever crosses it is
not [[authority]], but a distemper thereof. this [[liberty]] is maintained in a
way of subjection to [[authority]]; and the [[authority]] set over you will, in
all administrations for your [[good]], be quietly submitted unto by all but
such as have a disposition to shake off the yoke and lose their true
liberty, by their murmuring at the [[honor]] and [[power]] of [[authority]]."

the remarks i have made will suffice to display the [[character]] of
anglo-american [[civilization]] in its true [[light]]. it is the result (and
this should be constantly [[present]] to the [[mind]] of two distinct elements),
which in other places have been in frequent hostility, but which in
america have been admirably incorporated and combined with one another.
i allude to the spirit of [[religion]] and the spirit of [[liberty]].

the settlers of new [[england]] were at the same [[time]] ardent sectarians
and daring innovators. narrow as the limits of some of their religious
opinions were, they were entirely [[free]] from [[political]] prejudices. hence
arose two tendencies, distinct but not opposite, which are constantly
discernible in the manners as well as in the laws [[law]] of the [[country]].

it might be imagined that [[men]] who sacrificed their [[friends]], their
family, and their native [[land]] to a [[religious]] conviction were absorbed
in the pursuit of the intellectual advantages which they purchased at
so dear a rate. the energy, however, with which they strove for the
acquirement of [[wealth]], [[moral]] enjoyment, and the comforts as well as
liberties of the [[world]], is scarcely inferior to that with which they
devoted themselves to [[heaven]].

political principles [[principle]] and all [[human]] laws [[law]] and [[institutions]] were moulded
and altered at their [[pleasure]]; the barriers of the [[society]] in which they
were born were broken down before them; the old principles [[principle]] which had
governed the [[world]] for ages [[age]] were no more; a path without a turn and
a field without an horizon were opened to the exploring and ardent
curiosity of [[man]]: but at the limits of the [[political]] [[world]] he checks
his researches, he discreetly lays aside the use of his most formidable
faculties, he no longer consents to [[doubt]] or to innovate, but carefully
abstaining from raising the curtain of the sanctuary, he yields with
submissive [[respect]] to truths [[truth]] which he will not discuss. thus, in the
moral [[world]] everything is classed, adapted, decided, and foreseen; in
the [[political]] [[world]] everything is agitated, uncertain, and disputed:
in the one is a passive, though a voluntary, [[obedience]]; in the other an
independence scornful of [[experience]] and [[jealous]] of [[authority]].

these two tendencies, apparently so discrepant, are far from
conflicting; they advance together, and mutually support each other.
religion perceives that civil [[liberty]] affords a [[noble]] exercise to the
faculties of [[man]], and that the [[political]] [[world]] is a field prepared by
the creator for the efforts of the [[intelligence]]. contented with the
freedom and the [[power]] which it enjoys in its own sphere, and with the
place which it occupies, the [[empire]] of [[religion]] is never more surely
established than when it reigns in the hearts [[heart]] of [[men]] unsupported by
aught beside its native [[strength]]. [[religion]] is no less the companion of
liberty in all its battles [[battle]] and its triumphs; the cradle of its infancy,
and the [[divine]] source of its claims. the safeguard of morality is
religion, and morality is the [[best]] security of [[law]] and the surest pledge
of [[freedom]]. *m

[footnote m: see appendix, f.]

reasons of [[certain]] anomalies which the laws [[law]] and customs of the
anglo-americans present

remains of aristocratic [[institutions]] in the midst of a complete
democracy--why?--distinction carefully to be drawn between what is of
puritanical and what is of english origin.

the reader is cautioned not to draw too general or too absolute an
inference from what has been said. the social condition, the [[religion]],
and the manners of the first emigrants undoubtedly exercised an immense
influence on the [[destiny]] of their new [[country]]. nevertheless they were
not in a situation to found a [[state]] of things solely dependent on
themselves: no [[man]] can entirely shake off the influence of the [[past]], and
the settlers, intentionally or involuntarily, mingled habits and notions
derived from their [[education]] and from the traditions of their country
with those habits and notions which were exclusively their own. to form
a [[judgment]] on the anglo-americans of the [[present]] day it is therefore
necessary to distinguish what is of puritanical and what is of english
origin.

laws and customs are frequently to be met with in the [[united]] states
which contrast strongly with all that surrounds them. these laws [[law]] seem to
be drawn up in a spirit contrary to the prevailing tenor of the american
legislation; and these customs are no less opposed to the tone of
society. if the english colonies had been founded in an [[age]] of darkness,
or if their origin was already lost in the lapse of years, the problem
would be insoluble.

i shall quote a [[single]] [[example]] to illustrate what i advance. the
civil and [[criminal]] procedure of the americans has only two means of
action--committal and bail. the first measure taken by the magistrate
is to exact security from the defendant, or, in case of refusal, to
incarcerate him: the ground of the accusation and the importance of the
charges against him are then discussed. it is evident that a legislation
of this [[kind]] is hostile to the [[poor]] [[man]], and favorable only to the
rich. the [[poor]] [[man]] has not always a security to [[produce]], even in a
civil cause; and if he is obliged to wait for [[justice]] in prison, he is
speedily reduced to distress. the wealthy [[individual]], on the contrary,
always escapes imprisonment in civil causes; nay, more, he may readily
elude the [[punishment]] which awaits him for a delinquency by breaking his
bail. so that all the penalties of the [[law]] are, for him, reducible
to fines. *n nothing can be more aristocratic than this [[system]] of
legislation. yet in [[america]] it is the [[poor]] who make the [[law]], and they
usually reserve the [[greatest]] social advantages to themselves. the
explanation of the phenomenon is to be found in [[england]]; the laws [[law]] of
which i speak are english, *o and the americans have retained them,
however repugnant they may be to the tenor of their legislation and the
mass of their ideas [[idea]]. next to its habits, the thing which a nation
is least apt to [[change]] is its civil legislation. civil laws [[law]] are only
familiarly known to legal [[men]], whose direct interest it is to maintain
them as they are, whether [[good]] or [[bad]], simply because they themselves
are conversant with them. the [[body]] of the nation is scarcely acquainted
with them; it merely perceives their action in particular cases; but it
has some difficulty in seizing their tendency, and obeys them without
premeditation. i have quoted one instance where it would have been easy
to adduce a [[great]] number of others. the surface of american [[society]] is,
if i may use the expression, covered with a layer of [[democracy]], from
beneath which the old aristocratic colors sometimes peep.

[footnote n: crimes no [[doubt]] [[exist]] for which bail is inadmissible, but
they are few in number.]

chapter iii: social conditions of the anglo-americans

chapter summary

a social condition is commonly the result of circumstances, sometimes of
laws, oftener still of these two causes [[united]]; but wherever it exists,
it may justly be considered as the source of almost all the laws [[law]], the
usages, and the ideas [[idea]] which regulate the conduct of nations; whatever
it does not [[produce]] it modifies. it is therefore necessary, if we would
become acquainted with the legislation and the manners of a nation, to
begin by the study of its social condition.

the striking characteristic of the social condition of the
anglo-americans in its essential [[democracy]].

the first emigrants of new england--their equality--aristocratic laws
introduced in the south--period of the revolution--change in the law
of descent--effects produced by this change--democracy carried to its
utmost limits in the new states of the west--equality of [[education]].

many important observations suggest themselves upon the social condition
of the anglo-americans, but there is one which takes precedence of all
the rest. the social condition of the americans is eminently democratic;
this was its [[character]] at the foundation of the colonies, and is still
more strongly marked at the [[present]] day. i have stated in the preceding
chapter that [[great]] equality existed among the emigrants who settled on
the shores of new [[england]]. the germ of [[aristocracy]] was never planted in
that part of the union. the only influence which obtained there was that
of [[intellect]]; the [[people]] were used to reverence [[certain]] names as the
emblems of [[knowledge]] and [[virtue]]. some of their fellow-citizens acquired
a [[power]] over the rest which might truly have been called aristocratic,
if it had been capable of transmission from [[father]] to [[son]].

this was the [[state]] of things to the east of the hudson: to the
south-west of that river, and in the direction of the floridas, the case
was different. in most of the states situated to the south-west of the
hudson some [[great]] english proprietors had settled, who had imported
with them aristocratic principles [[principle]] and the english [[law]] of descent. i have
explained the reasons [[reason]] why it was impossible ever to establish a powerful
aristocracy in [[america]]; these reasons [[reason]] existed with less [[force]] to the
south-west of the hudson. in the south, one [[man]], aided by slaves [[slave]], could
cultivate a [[great]] extent of [[country]]: it was therefore [[common]] to see rich
landed proprietors. but their influence was not altogether aristocratic
as that term is understood in [[europe]], since they possessed no
privileges; and the cultivation of their estates being carried on by
slaves, they had no tenants depending on them, and consequently no
patronage. still, the [[great]] proprietors south of the hudson constituted
a superior class, having ideas [[idea]] and tastes of its own, and forming the
centre of [[political]] action. this [[kind]] of [[aristocracy]] sympathized with
the [[body]] of the [[people]], whose [[passions]] and interests it easily embraced;
but it was too [[weak]] and too short-lived to excite either [[love]] or hatred
for itself. this was the class which headed the insurrection in the
south, and furnished the [[best]] leaders of the american [[revolution]].

at the period of which we are now speaking [[society]] was shaken to
its centre: the [[people]], in whose name the struggle had taken place,
conceived the [[desire]] of exercising the [[authority]] which it had acquired;
its democratic tendencies were awakened; and having thrown off the yoke
of the mother-country, it aspired to independence of every [[kind]]. the
influence of individuals [[individual]] gradually ceased to be [[felt]], and custom and law
united together to [[produce]] the same result.

but the [[law]] of descent was the [[last]] step to equality. i am surprised
that ancient and [[modern]] jurists have not attributed to this [[law]] a
greater influence on [[human]] affairs. *a it is true that these laws [[law]] belong
to civil affairs; but they ought nevertheless to be placed at the head
of all [[political]] [[institutions]]; for, whilst [[political]] laws [[law]] are only the
symbol of a nation's condition, they exercise an incredible influence
upon its social [[state]]. they have, moreover, a sure and uniform manner of
operating upon [[society]], affecting, as it were, generations [[generation]] yet unborn.

[footnote a: i [[understand]] by the [[law]] of descent all those laws [[law]] whose
principal object is to regulate the distribution of [[property]] after the
death of its owner. the [[law]] of entail is of this number; it certainly
prevents the owner from disposing of his possessions before his [[death]];
but this is solely with the view of preserving them entire for the heir.
the principal object, therefore, of the [[law]] of entail is to regulate the
descent of [[property]] after the [[death]] of its owner: its other provisions
are merely means to this end.]

through their means [[man]] acquires a [[kind]] of preternatural [[power]] over the
future lot of his fellow-creatures. when the legislator has regulated
the [[law]] of [[inheritance]], he may rest from his labor. the machine once put
in motion will go on for ages [[age]], and advance, as if self-guided, towards a
given point. when framed in a particular manner, this [[law]] unites, draws
together, and vests [[property]] and [[power]] in a few hands: its tendency is
clearly aristocratic. on opposite principles [[principle]] its action is still more
rapid; it divides, distributes, and disperses both [[property]] and [[power]].
alarmed by the rapidity of its [[progress]], those who despair of arresting
its motion endeavor to obstruct it by difficulties and impediments;
they vainly seek to counteract its effect by contrary efforts; but it
gradually reduces or destroys every obstacle, until by its incessant
activity the bulwarks of the influence of [[wealth]] are ground down to the
fine and shifting sand which is the basis of [[democracy]]. when the [[law]] of
inheritance permits, still more when it decrees, the [[equal]] division of
a father's [[property]] amongst all his [[children]], its effects are of two
kinds: it is important to distinguish them from each other, although
they tend to the same end.

in [[virtue]] of the [[law]] of partible [[inheritance]], the [[death]] of every
proprietor brings about a [[kind]] of [[revolution]] in [[property]]; not only do
his possessions [[change]] hands, but their very [[nature]] is altered, since
they are parcelled into shares, which become smaller and smaller at each
division. this is the direct and, as it were, the physical effect of the
law. it follows, then, that in countries [[country]] where equality of inheritance
is established by [[law]], [[property]], and especially landed [[property]], must
have a tendency to perpetual diminution. the effects, however, of such
legislation would only be perceptible after a lapse of [[time]], if the law
was abandoned to its own working; for supposing the [[family]] to consist of
two [[children]] (and in a [[country]] [[people]] as [[france]] is the average number
is not above three), these [[children]], sharing amongst them the [[fortune]] of
both parents, would not be poorer than their [[father]] or [[mother]].

but the [[law]] of [[equal]] division exercises its influence not merely upon
the [[property]] itself, but it affects the minds [[mind]] of the heirs, and brings
their [[passions]] into play. these indirect consequences tend powerfully
to the destruction of large fortunes [[fortune]], and especially of large domains.
among nations whose [[law]] of descent is founded upon the [[right]] of
primogeniture landed estates often pass from [[generation]] to generation
without undergoing division, the consequence of which is that family
feeling is to a [[certain]] [[degree]] incorporated with the estate. the family
represents the estate, the estate the [[family]]; whose name, together with
its origin, its [[glory]], its [[power]], and its virtues [[virtue]], is thus perpetuated
in an imperishable memorial of the [[past]] and a sure pledge of the future.

when the [[equal]] partition of [[property]] is established by [[law]], the intimate
connection is destroyed between [[family]] feeling and the preservation of
the paternal estate; the [[property]] ceases to represent the [[family]]; for
as it must inevitably be divided after one or two generations [[generation]], it
has evidently a constant tendency to diminish, and must in the end be
completely dispersed. the sons [[son]] of the [[great]] landed proprietor, if they
are few in number, or if [[fortune]] befriends them, may indeed entertain
the [[hope]] of being as wealthy as their [[father]], but not that of possessing
the same [[property]] as he did; the riches [[rich]] must necessarily be composed of
elements different from his.

now, from the moment that you divest the landowner of that interest in
the preservation of his estate which he derives from association, from
tradition, and from [[family]] [[pride]], you may be [[certain]] that sooner or
later he will dispose of it; for there is a [[strong]] pecuniary interest in
favor of selling, as floating [[capital]] produces [[produce]] higher interest than real
property, and is more readily available to gratify the [[passions]] of the
moment.

great landed estates which have once been divided never come together
again; for the small proprietor draws from his [[land]] a [[better]] [[revenue]], in
proportion, than the large owner does from his, and of course he sells
it at a higher rate. *b the calculations of gain, therefore, which
decide the [[rich]] [[man]] to sell his domain will still more powerfully
influence him against buying small estates to unite them into a large
one.

[footnote b: i do not mean to say that the small proprietor cultivates
his [[land]] [[better]], but he cultivates it with more ardor and [[care]]; so that
he makes up by his labor for his want of [[skill]].]

what is called [[family]] [[pride]] is often founded upon an illusion of
self-love. a [[man]] wishes [[wish]] to perpetuate and immortalize himself, as it
were, in his great-grandchildren. where the esprit de famille ceases
to act [[individual]] selfishness comes into play. when the [[idea]] of family
becomes vague, indeterminate, and uncertain, a [[man]] thinks [[think]] of his
present convenience; he provides for the establishment of his succeeding
generation, and no more. either a [[man]] gives up the [[idea]] of perpetuating
his [[family]], or at any rate he seeks to accomplish it by other means
than that of a landed estate. thus not only does the [[law]] of partible
inheritance render it difficult for families [[family]] to preserve their ancestral
domains entire, but it deprives them of the inclination to attempt it,
and compels them in some measure to co-operate with the [[law]] in their own
extinction.

the [[law]] of [[equal]] distribution proceeds by two methods: by acting upon
things, it acts upon persons [[person]]; by influencing persons [[person]], it affects things.
by these means the [[law]] succeeds in striking at the root of landed
property, and dispersing rapidly both families [[family]] and fortunes [[fortune]]. *c

[footnote c: [[land]] being the most stable [[kind]] of [[property]], we find, from
time to [[time]], [[rich]] individuals [[individual]] who are disposed to make [[great]] sacrifices
in order to obtain it, and who willingly forfeit a considerable part of
their income to make sure of the rest. but these are accidental cases.
the preference for landed [[property]] is no longer found habitually in any
class but among the [[poor]]. the small landowner, who has less information,
less [[imagination]], and fewer [[passions]] than the [[great]] one, is generally
occupied with the [[desire]] of increasing his estate: and it often happens
that by [[inheritance]], by [[marriage]], or by the chances [[chance]] of [[trade]], he is
gradually furnished with the means. thus, to balance the tendency which
leads [[men]] to divide their estates, there exists another, which incites
them to add to them. this tendency, which is sufficient to prevent
estates from being divided ad infinitum, is not [[strong]] enough to create
great territorial possessions, certainly not to keep them up in the same
family.]

most certainly it is not for us frenchmen of the nineteenth century,
who daily witness the [[political]] and social changes [[change]] which the law
of partition is bringing to pass, to [[question]] its influence. it is
perpetually conspicuous in our [[country]], overthrowing the walls of our
dwellings and removing the landmarks of our fields. but although it has
produced [[great]] effects in [[france]], much still remains for it to do. our
recollections, opinions [[opinion]], and habits [[present]] powerful obstacles to its
progress.

in the [[united]] states it has nearly completed its [[work]] of destruction,
and there we can [[best]] study its results. the english laws [[law]] concerning the
transmission of [[property]] were abolished in almost all the states at
the [[time]] of the [[revolution]]. the [[law]] of entail was so modified as not
to interrupt the [[free]] circulation of [[property]]. *d the first generation
having passed away, estates began to be parcelled out, and the change
became more and more rapid with the [[progress]] of [[time]]. at this moment,
after a lapse of a little more than sixty years, the aspect of society
is totally altered; the families [[family]] of the [[great]] landed proprietors are
almost all commingled with the general mass. in the [[state]] of new york,
which formerly contained many of these, there are but two who still keep
their heads above the stream, and they must shortly disappear. the sons
of these opulent [[citizens]] are become merchants, lawyers, or physicians.
most of them have lapsed into obscurity. the [[last]] trace of hereditary
ranks and distinctions is destroyed--the [[law]] of partition has reduced
all to one level. [footnote d: see appendix, g.]

i do not mean that there is any deficiency of wealthy individuals [[individual]] in the
united states; i [[know]] of no [[country]], indeed, where the [[love]] of [[money]] has
taken stronger hold on the affections of [[men]], and where the profounder
contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of
property. but [[wealth]] circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and
experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations [[generation]] in
the full enjoyment of it.

this picture, which may perhaps be [[thought]] to be overcharged, still
gives a very imperfect [[idea]] of what is taking place in the new states
of the west and south-west. at the end of the [[last]] century a few bold
adventurers began to penetrate into the valleys of the mississippi, and
the mass of the [[population]] very soon began to move in that direction:
communities unheard of till then were seen to emerge from the wilds:
states whose names were not in existence a few years before claimed
their place in the american union; and in the western settlements we may
behold [[democracy]] arrived at its utmost extreme. in these states,
founded off-hand, and, as it were, by [[chance]], the inhabitants are but
of yesterday. scarcely known to one another, the nearest neighbors
are ignorant of each other's [[history]]. in this part of the american
continent, therefore, the [[population]] has not experienced the influence
of [[great]] names and [[great]] [[wealth]], nor even that of the natural
aristocracy of [[knowledge]] and [[virtue]]. none are there to wield that
respectable [[power]] which [[men]] willingly grant to the remembrance of a life
spent in doing [[good]] before their [[eyes]]. the new states of the west are
already inhabited, but [[society]] has no existence among them. *e

[footnote e: this may have been true in 1832, but is not so in 1874,
when [[great]] cities [[city]] like chicago and san francisco have sprung up in
the western states. but as yet the western states exert no powerful
influence on american [[society]].---translator's note.]

it is not only the fortunes [[fortune]] of [[men]] which are [[equal]] in [[america]]; even
their requirements partake in some [[degree]] of the same uniformity. i do
not [[believe]] that there is a [[country]] in the [[world]] where, in proportion
to the [[population]], there are so few uninstructed and at the same time
so few learned individuals [[individual]]. primary instruction is within the reach of
everybody; superior instruction is scarcely to be obtained by any. this
is not surprising; it is in [[fact]] the necessary consequence of what we
have advanced above. almost all the americans are in easy circumstances,
and can therefore obtain the first elements of [[human]] [[knowledge]].

in [[america]] there are comparatively few who are [[rich]] enough to live
without a profession. every profession requires an apprenticeship, which
limits the [[time]] of instruction to the early years of [[life]]. at fifteen
they enter upon their calling, and thus their [[education]] ends at the age
when ours begins. whatever is done afterwards is with a view to some
special and lucrative object; a [[science]] is taken up as a matter of
business, and the only branch of it which is attended to is such as
admits of an immediate practical application. in [[america]] most of the
rich [[men]] were formerly [[poor]]; most of those who now enjoy leisure were
absorbed in [[business]] during their [[youth]]; the consequence of which is,
that when they might have had a taste for study they had no [[time]] for it,
and when [[time]] is at their disposal they have no longer the inclination.

there is no class, then, in [[america]], in which the taste for intellectual
pleasures is transmitted with hereditary [[fortune]] and leisure, and by
which the labors of the [[intellect]] are held in [[honor]]. accordingly there
is an [[equal]] want of the [[desire]] and the [[power]] of application to these
objects.

a middle standard is fixed in [[america]] for [[human]] [[knowledge]]. all approach
as near to it as they can; some as they rise, others as they descend.
of course, an immense multitude of persons [[person]] are to be found who entertain
the same number of ideas [[idea]] on [[religion]], [[history]], [[science]], political
economy, legislation, and [[government]]. the gifts of [[intellect]] proceed
directly from [[god]], and [[man]] cannot prevent their unequal distribution.
but in consequence of the [[state]] of things which we have here represented
it happens that, although the capacities of [[men]] are widely different, as
the creator has doubtless intended they should be, they are submitted to
the same method of treatment.

in [[america]] the aristocratic element has always been feeble from its
birth; and if at the [[present]] day it is not actually destroyed, it is at
any rate so completely disabled that we can scarcely assign to it any
degree of influence in the course of affairs. the democratic [[principle]],
on the contrary, has gained so much [[strength]] by [[time]], by events, and by
legislation, as to have become not only predominant but all-powerful.
there is no [[family]] or corporate [[authority]], and it is rare to find even
the influence of [[individual]] [[character]] enjoy any durability.

america, then, exhibits in her social [[state]] a most extraordinary
phenomenon. [[men]] are there seen on a greater equality in point of fortune
and [[intellect]], or, in other words, more [[equal]] in their [[strength]], than
in any other [[country]] of the [[world]], or in any [[age]] of which [[history]] has
preserved the remembrance.

political consequences of the social condition of the anglo-americans

the [[political]] consequences of such a social condition as this are easily
deducible. it is impossible to [[believe]] that equality will not eventually
find its way into the [[political]] [[world]] as it does everywhere else. to
conceive of [[men]] remaining forever unequal upon one [[single]] point, yet
equal on all others, is impossible; they must come in the end to be
equal upon all. now i [[know]] of only two methods of establishing equality
in the [[political]] [[world]]; every citizen must be put in possession of
his rights [[right]], or rights [[right]] must be granted to no one. for nations which are
arrived at the same stage of social existence as the anglo-americans, it
is therefore very difficult to discover a medium between the sovereignty
of all and the absolute [[power]] of one [[man]]: and it would be [[vain]] to deny
that the social condition which i have been describing is equally liable
to each of these consequences.

there is, in [[fact]], a manly and lawful passion for equality which excites
men to [[wish]] all to be powerful and honored. this passion tends to
elevate the humble to the rank of the [[great]]; but there exists also in
the [[human]] [[heart]] a depraved taste for equality, which impels the weak
to attempt to lower the powerful to their own level, and reduces [[men]] to
prefer equality in [[slavery]] to inequality with [[freedom]]. not that those
nations whose social condition is democratic naturally despise [[liberty]];
on the contrary, they have an instinctive [[love]] of it. but [[liberty]] is not
the [[chief]] and constant object of their desires [[desire]]; equality is their idol:
they make rapid and sudden efforts to obtain [[liberty]], and if they miss
their aim resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can
satisfy them except equality, and rather than lose it they resolve to
perish.

on the other hand, in a [[state]] where the [[citizens]] are nearly on an
equality, it becomes difficult for them to preserve their independence
against the aggressions of [[power]]. no one among them being strong
enough to engage in the struggle with advantage, nothing but a general
combination can [[protect]] their [[liberty]]. and such a union is not always to
be found.

from the same social position, then, nations may derive one or the other
of two [[great]] [[political]] results; these results are extremely different
from each other, but they may both proceed from the same cause.

the anglo-americans are the first nations who, having been exposed
to this formidable alternative, have been [[happy]] enough to escape
the dominion of absolute [[power]]. they have been allowed by their
circumstances, their origin, their [[intelligence]], and especially by their
moral feeling, to establish and maintain the sovereignty of the [[people]].




chapter iv: the [[principle]] of the sovereignty of the [[people]] in america

chapter summary

it predominates over the whole of [[society]] in america--application
made of this [[principle]] by the americans even before their
revolution--development given to it by that revolution--gradual and
irresistible extension of the elective qualification.

the [[principle]] of the sovereignty of the [[people]] in america

whenever the [[political]] laws [[law]] of the [[united]] states are to be discussed,
it is with the doctrine of the sovereignty of the [[people]] that we must
begin. the [[principle]] of the sovereignty of the [[people]], which is to be
found, more or less, at the bottom of almost all [[human]] [[institutions]],
generally remains concealed from view. it is obeyed without being
recognized, or if for a moment it be brought to [[light]], it is hastily
cast back into the gloom of the sanctuary. "the will of the nation" is
one of those expressions which have been most profusely abused by the
wily and the despotic of every [[age]]. to the [[eyes]] of some it has been
represented by the venal suffrages of a few of the satellites of [[power]];
to others by the votes of a timid or an interested minority; and some
have even discovered it in the [[silence]] of a [[people]], on the supposition
that the [[fact]] of submission established the [[right]] of command.

in [[america]] the [[principle]] of the sovereignty of the [[people]] is not either
barren or concealed, as it is with some other nations; it is recognized
by the customs and proclaimed by the laws [[law]]; it spreads freely, and
arrives without impediment at its most remote consequences. if there
be a [[country]] in the [[world]] where the doctrine of the sovereignty of
the [[people]] can be fairly appreciated, where it can be [[studied]] in its
application to the affairs of [[society]], and where its dangers and its
advantages may be foreseen, that [[country]] is assuredly [[america]].

i have already observed that, from their origin, the sovereignty of the
people was the fundamental [[principle]] of the greater number of british
colonies in [[america]]. it was far, however, from then exercising as much
influence on the [[government]] of [[society]] as it now does. two obstacles,
the one external, the other internal, checked its invasive [[progress]]. it
could not ostensibly disclose itself in the laws [[law]] of colonies which were
still constrained to obey the mother-country: it was therefore obliged
to spread secretly, and to gain ground in the provincial assemblies, and
especially in the townships.

american [[society]] was not yet prepared to adopt it with all its
consequences. the [[intelligence]] of new [[england]], and the [[wealth]] of the
country to the south of the hudson (as i have shown in the preceding
chapter), long exercised a sort of aristocratic influence, which tended
to retain the exercise of social [[authority]] in the hands of a few. the
public functionaries were not universally elected, and the [[citizens]] were
not all of them electors. the electoral franchise was everywhere placed
within [[certain]] limits, and made dependent on a [[certain]] qualification,
which was exceedingly low in the north and more considerable in the
south.

the american [[revolution]] broke out, and the doctrine of the sovereignty
of the [[people]], which had been nurtured in the townships and
municipalities, took possession of the [[state]]: every class was enlisted
in its cause; battles [[battle]] were fought, and victories [[victory]] obtained for it, until
it became the [[law]] of laws [[law]].

a no less rapid [[change]] was effected in the interior of [[society]], where
the [[law]] of descent completed the abolition of local influences.

at the very [[time]] when this consequence of the laws [[law]] and of the revolution
was apparent to every eye, [[victory]] was irrevocably pronounced in favor
of the democratic cause. all [[power]] was, in [[fact]], in its hands, and
resistance was no longer possible. the higher orders submitted without
a murmur and without a struggle to an [[evil]] which was thenceforth
inevitable. the ordinary [[fate]] of falling powers [[power]] awaited them; each
of their several members followed his own interests; and as it was
impossible to wring the [[power]] from the hands of a [[people]] which they
did not detest sufficiently to brave, their only aim was to secure its
good-will at any price. the most democratic laws [[law]] were consequently voted
by the very [[men]] whose interests they impaired; and thus, although the
higher classes did not excite the [[passions]] of the [[people]] against their
order, they accelerated the triumph of the new [[state]] of things; so
that by a singular [[change]] the democratic impulse was found to be most
irresistible in the very states where the [[aristocracy]] had the firmest
hold. the [[state]] of maryland, which had been founded by [[men]] of rank,
was the first to proclaim universal suffrage, and to introduce the most
democratic forms into the conduct of its [[government]].

when a nation modifies the elective qualification, it may easily be
foreseen that sooner or later that qualification will be entirely
abolished. there is no more invariable [[rule]] in the [[history]] of [[society]]:
the further electoral rights [[right]] are extended, the greater is the need of
extending them; for after each concession the [[strength]] of the democracy
increases, and its demands increase with its [[strength]]. the [[ambition]] of
those who are below the appointed rate is irritated in exact proportion
to the [[great]] number of those who are above it. the exception at last
becomes the [[rule]], concession follows concession, and no stop can be made
short of universal suffrage.

at the [[present]] day the [[principle]] of the sovereignty of the [[people]] has
acquired, in the [[united]] states, all the practical [[development]] which the
imagination can conceive. it is unencumbered by those fictions which
have been thrown over it in other countries [[country]], and it appears in every
possible form according to the exigency of the [[occasion]]. sometimes the
laws are made by the [[people]] in a [[body]], as at [[athens]]; and sometimes its
representatives, chosen by universal suffrage, transact [[business]] in its
name, and almost under its immediate control.

in some countries [[country]] a [[power]] exists which, though it is in a [[degree]] foreign
to the social [[body]], directs it, and forces [[force]] it to pursue a [[certain]] track.
in others the ruling [[force]] is divided, being partly within and partly
without the ranks of the [[people]]. but nothing of the [[kind]] is to be seen
in the [[united]] states; there [[society]] governs itself for itself. all power
centres in its bosom; and scarcely an [[individual]] is to be meet with
who would venture to conceive, or, still less, to express, the [[idea]] of
seeking it elsewhere. the nation participates in the making of its laws
by the [[choice]] of its legislators, and in the execution of them by the
choice of the agents of the executive [[government]]; it may almost be said
to govern itself, so feeble and so restricted is the share left to the
administration, so little do the authorities [[authority]] forget their popular origin
and the [[power]] from which they emanate. *a [footnote a: see appendix, h.]




chapter v: necessity of examining the condition of the states--part i

necessity of examining the condition of the states before that of the
union at large.

it is proposed to examine in the following [[chapter]] what is the form of
government established in [[america]] on the [[principle]] of the sovereignty of
the [[people]]; what are its resources, its hindrances, its advantages, and
its dangers. the first difficulty which presents [[present]] itself arises from the
complex [[nature]] of the [[constitution]] of the [[united]] states, which consists
of two distinct social structures, connected and, as it were, encased
one within the other; two governments [[government]], completely separate and almost
independent, the one fulfilling the ordinary duties [[duty]] and responding to
the daily and indefinite calls of a [[community]], the other circumscribed
within [[certain]] limits, and only exercising an exceptional [[authority]] over
the general interests of the [[country]]. in short, there are twenty-four
small [[sovereign]] nations, whose agglomeration constitutes the [[body]] of the
union. to examine the union before we have [[studied]] the states would
be to adopt a method filled with obstacles. the form of the federal
government of the [[united]] states was the [[last]] which was adopted; and
it is in [[fact]] nothing more than a modification or a summary of those
republican principles [[principle]] which were current in the whole [[community]] before
it existed, and independently of its existence. moreover, the federal
government is, as i have just observed, the exception; the government
of the states is the [[rule]]. the author who should attempt to exhibit the
picture as a whole before he had explained its details would necessarily
fall into obscurity and repetition.

the [[great]] [[political]] principles [[principle]] which govern american [[society]] at this
day undoubtedly took their origin and their [[growth]] in the [[state]]. it
is therefore necessary to become acquainted with the [[state]] in order to
possess a clue to the remainder. the states which at [[present]] compose
the american union all [[present]] the same features, as far as regards the
external aspect of their [[institutions]]. their [[political]] or administrative
existence is centred in three focuses of action, which may not inaptly
be compared to the different nervous centres which convey motion to the
human [[body]]. the township is the lowest in order, then the county, and
lastly the [[state]]; and i propose to devote the following [[chapter]] to the
examination of these three divisions.

the american [[system]] of townships and municipal bodies

why the author begins the examination of the [[political]] [[institutions]] with
the township--its existence in all nations--difficulty of establishing
and preserving municipal independence--its importance--why the author
has selected the township [[system]] of new [[england]] as the main topic of his
discussion.

it is not undesignedly that i begin this [[subject]] with the township.
the village or township is the only association which is so perfectly
natural that wherever a number of [[men]] are collected it seems to
constitute itself.

the town, or tithing, as the smallest division of a [[community]], must
necessarily [[exist]] in all nations, whatever their laws [[law]] and customs
may be: if [[man]] makes monarchies [[monarchy]] and establishes republics [[republic]], the first
association of [[mankind]] seems constituted by the hand of [[god]]. but
although the existence of the township is coeval with that of [[man]], its
liberties are not the less rarely respected and easily destroyed. a
nation is always able to establish [[great]] [[political]] assemblies, because
it habitually contains a [[certain]] number of individuals [[individual]] fitted by their
talents, if not by their habits, for the direction of affairs. the
township is, on the contrary, composed of coarser materials, which are
less easily fashioned by the legislator. the difficulties which attend
the consolidation of its independence rather augment than diminish with
the increasing enlightenment of the [[people]]. a highly civilized community
spurns the attempts of a local independence, is disgusted at its
numerous blunders, and is apt to despair of [[success]] before the
experiment is completed. again, no immunities are so ill protected from
the encroachments of the supreme [[power]] as those of municipal bodies [[body]] in
general: they are unable to struggle, single-handed, against a strong
or an enterprising [[government]], and they cannot defend their cause with
success unless it be identified with the customs of the nation and
supported by [[public]] [[opinion]]. thus until the independence of townships is
amalgamated with the manners of a [[people]] it is easily destroyed, and
it is only after a long existence in the laws [[law]] that it can be thus
amalgamated. municipal [[freedom]] is not the fruit of [[human]] device; it
is rarely created; but it is, as it were, secretly and spontaneously
engendered in the midst of a semi-barbarous [[state]] of [[society]].
the constant action of the laws [[law]] and the national habits, peculiar
circumstances, and above all [[time]], may consolidate it; but there is
certainly no nation on the continent of [[europe]] which has experienced
its advantages. nevertheless local assemblies of [[citizens]] constitute
the [[strength]] of [[free]] nations. town-meetings are to [[liberty]] what primary
schools are to [[science]]; they bring it within the people's reach, they
teach [[men]] how to use and how to enjoy it. a nation may establish
a [[system]] of [[free]] [[government]], but without the spirit of municipal
institutions it cannot have the spirit of [[liberty]]. the transient
passions and the interests of an hour, or the [[chance]] of circumstances,
may have created the external forms of independence; but the despotic
tendency which has been repelled will, sooner or later, inevitably
reappear on the surface.

in order to explain to the reader the general principles [[principle]] on which the
political organization of the counties and townships of the united
states rests, i have [[thought]] it expedient to choose one of the states of
new [[england]] as an [[example]], to examine the mechanism of its [[constitution]],
and then to cast a general glance over the [[country]]. the township and the
county are not organized in the same manner in every part of the union;
it is, however, easy to perceive that the same principles [[principle]] have guided
the formation of both of them throughout the union. i am inclined to
believe that these principles [[principle]] have been carried further in new england
than elsewhere, and consequently that they offer greater facilities to
the observations of a stranger. the [[institutions]] of new [[england]] form
a complete and regular whole; they have received the sanction of [[time]],
they have the support of the laws [[law]], and the still stronger support of the
manners of the [[community]], over which they exercise the most prodigious
influence; they consequently deserve our attention on every account.

limits of the township

the township of new [[england]] is a division which stands between the
commune and the canton of [[france]], and which corresponds in general to
the english tithing, or town. its average [[population]] is from two to
three thousand; *a so that, on the one hand, the interests of its
inhabitants are not likely to conflict, and, on the other, [[men]] capable
of conducting its affairs are always to be found among its [[citizens]].

[footnote a: in 1830 there were 305 townships in the [[state]] of
massachusetts, and 610,014 inhabitants, which gives an average of about
2,000 inhabitants to each township.]

authorities of the township in new england

the [[people]] the source of all [[power]] here as elsewhere--manages its own
affairs--no corporation--the greater part of the [[authority]] vested in the
hands of the selectmen--how the selectmen act--town-meeting--enumeration
of the [[public]] officers of the township--obligatory and remunerated
functions.

in the township, as well as everywhere else, the [[people]] is the only
source of [[power]]; but in no stage of [[government]] does the [[body]] of citizens
exercise a more immediate influence. in [[america]] the [[people]] is a master
whose exigencies demand [[obedience]] to the utmost limits of possibility.

in new [[england]] the majority acts by representatives in the conduct
of the [[public]] [[business]] of the [[state]]; but if such an arrangement be
necessary in general affairs, in the townships, where the legislative
and administrative action of the [[government]] is in more immediate contact
with the [[subject]], the [[system]] of representation is not adopted. there is
no corporation; but the [[body]] of electors, after having designated its
magistrates, directs them in everything that exceeds the simple and
ordinary executive [[business]] of the [[state]]. *b

[footnote b: the same rules [[rule]] are not applicable to the [[great]] towns, which
generally have a mayor, and a corporation divided into two bodies [[body]]; this,
however, is an exception which requires the sanction of a [[law]].--see the
act of february 22, 1822, for appointing the authorities [[authority]] of the city
of boston. it frequently happens that small towns as well as cities
are [[subject]] to a peculiar administration. in 1832, 104 townships in the
state of new york were governed in this manner.--williams' register.]

this [[state]] of things is so contrary to our ideas [[idea]], and so different from
our customs, that it is necessary for me to adduce some examples [[example]] to
explain it thoroughly.

the [[public]] duties [[duty]] in the township are extremely numerous and minutely
divided, as we shall see further on; but the larger proportion of
administrative [[power]] is vested in the hands of a small number of
individuals, called "the selectmen." *c the general laws [[law]] of the state
impose a [[certain]] number of obligations on the selectmen, which they may
fulfil without the authorization of the [[body]] they represent, but which
they can only neglect on their own responsibility. the [[law]] of the state
obliges them, for instance, to draw up the list of electors in their
townships; and if they omit this part of their functions, they are
guilty of a misdemeanor. in all the affairs, however, which are
determined by the town-meeting, the selectmen are the organs of the
popular mandate, as in [[france]] the maire executes the decree of the
municipal council. they usually act upon their own responsibility, and
merely put in practice principles [[principle]] which have been previously recognized
by the majority. but if any [[change]] is to be introduced in the existing
state of things, or if they [[wish]] to undertake any new enterprise, they
are obliged to refer to the source of their [[power]]. if, for instance, a
school is to be established, the selectmen convoke the whole [[body]] of
the electors on a [[certain]] day at an appointed place; they explain the
urgency of the case; they give their [[opinion]] on the means of satisfying
it, on the probable expense, and the site which seems to be most
favorable. the meeting is consulted on these several points; it adopts
the [[principle]], marks out the site, votes the rate, and confides the
execution of its resolution to the selectmen.

[footnote c: three selectmen are appointed in the small townships, and
nine in the large ones. see "the town-officer," p. 186. see also the
principal laws [[law]] of the [[state]] of massachusetts relative to the selectmen:

act of february 20, 1786, vol. i. p. 219; february 24, 1796, vol. i. p.
488; march 7, 1801, vol. ii. p. 45; june 16, 1795, vol. i. p. 475; march
12, 1808, vol. ii. p. 186; february 28, 1787, vol. i. p. 302; june 22,
1797, vol. i. p. 539.]

the selectmen have alone the [[right]] of calling a town-meeting, but they
may be requested to do so: if ten [[citizens]] are desirous of submitting
a new project to the assent of the township, they may demand a general
convocation of the inhabitants; the selectmen are obliged to comply, but
they have only the [[right]] of presiding at the meeting. *d

[footnote d: see laws [[law]] of massachusetts, vol. i. p. 150, act of march 25,
1786.]

the selectmen are elected every year in the month of april or of may.
the town-meeting chooses at the same [[time]] a number of other municipal
magistrates, who are entrusted with important administrative functions.
the assessors rate the township; the collectors receive the rate. a
constable is appointed to keep the [[peace]], to watch the streets, and to
forward the execution of the laws [[law]]; the town-clerk records all the town
votes, orders, grants, births, deaths [[death]], and marriages [[marriage]]; the treasurer
keeps the funds; the overseer of the [[poor]] performs the difficult task of
superintending the action of the poor-laws; committee-men are
appointed to attend to the schools and to [[public]] instruction; and the
road-surveyors, who take [[care]] of the greater and lesser thoroughfares
of the township, complete the list of the principal functionaries.
they are, however, still further subdivided; and amongst the municipal
officers are to be found parish commissioners, who audit the expenses
of [[public]] [[worship]]; different classes of inspectors, some of whom are
to direct the [[citizens]] in case of [[fire]]; tithing-men, listers, haywards,
chimney-viewers, fence-viewers to maintain the bounds of [[property]],
timber-measurers, and sealers of weights and measures. *e

[footnote e: all these magistrates actually [[exist]]; their different
functions are all detailed in a [[book]] called "the town-officer," by isaac
goodwin, worcester, 1827; and in the "collection of the general laws [[law]] of
massachusetts," 3 vols., boston, 1823.]

there are nineteen principal officers in a township. every inhabitant
is constrained, on the [[pain]] of being fined, to undertake these different
functions; which, however, are almost all paid, in order that the poorer
citizens may be able to give up their [[time]] without loss. in general the
american [[system]] is not to grant a fixed salary to its functionaries.
every service has its price, and they are remunerated in proportion to
what they have done.

existence of the township

every one the [[best]] [[judge]] of his own interest--corollary of the principle
of the sovereignty of the people--application of those doctrines in the
townships of america--the township of new [[england]] is [[sovereign]] in
all that concerns itself alone: [[subject]] to the [[state]] in all other
matters--bond of the township and the state--in [[france]] the government
lends its agent to the commune--in [[america]] the reverse occurs.

i have already observed that the [[principle]] of the sovereignty of the
people governs the whole [[political]] [[system]] of the anglo-americans. every
page of this [[book]] will afford new instances of the same doctrine. in
the nations by which the sovereignty of the [[people]] is recognized every
individual possesses an [[equal]] share of [[power]], and participates alike in
the [[government]] of the [[state]]. every [[individual]] is, therefore, supposed
to be as well informed, as [[virtuous]], and as [[strong]] as any of his
fellow-citizens. he obeys the [[government]], not because he is inferior to
the authorities [[authority]] which conduct it, or that he is less capable than his
neighbor of governing himself, but because he acknowledges the utility
of an association with his fellow-men, and because he knows [[know]] that no such
association can [[exist]] without a regulating [[force]]. if he be a subject
in all that concerns the mutual relations of [[citizens]], he is [[free]] and
responsible to [[god]] alone for all that concerns himself. hence arises the
maxim that every one is the [[best]] and the sole [[judge]] of his own private
interest, and that [[society]] has no [[right]] to control a man's [[man]] actions,
unless they are prejudicial to the [[common]] weal, or unless the common
weal demands his co-operation. this doctrine is universally admitted in
the [[united]] states. i shall hereafter examine the general influence which
it exercises on the ordinary actions of [[life]]; i am now speaking of the
nature of municipal bodies [[body]].

the township, taken as a whole, and in relation to the [[government]] of the
country, may be looked upon as an [[individual]] to whom the theory i
have just alluded to is applied. municipal independence is therefore a
natural consequence of the [[principle]] of the sovereignty of the [[people]] in
the [[united]] states: all the american republics [[republic]] recognize it more or less;
but circumstances have peculiarly favored its [[growth]] in new [[england]].

in this part of the union the impulsion of [[political]] activity was given
in the townships; and it may almost be said that each of them originally
formed an independent nation. when the kings [[king]] of [[england]] asserted their
supremacy, they were contented to assume the central [[power]] of the [[state]].
the townships of new [[england]] remained as they were before; and although
they are now [[subject]] to the [[state]], they were at first scarcely dependent
upon it. it is important to [[remember]] that they have not been invested
with privileges [[privilege]], but that they have, on the contrary, forfeited a
portion of their independence to the [[state]]. the townships are only
subordinate to the [[state]] in those interests which i shall term social,
as they are [[common]] to all the [[citizens]]. they are independent in all
that concerns themselves; and amongst the inhabitants of new england
i [[believe]] that not a [[man]] is to be found who would acknowledge that the
state has any [[right]] to interfere in their local interests. the towns
of new [[england]] buy and sell, sue or are sued, augment or diminish
their rates, without the slightest opposition on the part of the
administrative [[authority]] of the [[state]].

they are bound, however, to comply with the demands of the [[community]]. if
the [[state]] is in need of [[money]], a town can neither give nor withhold the
supplies. if the [[state]] projects a road, the township cannot refuse to
let it cross its territory; if a [[police]] regulation is made by the [[state]],
it must be enforced by the town. a uniform [[system]] of instruction is
organized all over the [[country]], and every town is bound to establish the
schools which the [[law]] ordains. in speaking of the administration of the
united states i shall have [[occasion]] to point out the means by which the
townships are compelled to obey in these different cases: i here merely
show the existence of the obligation. strict as this obligation is,
the [[government]] of the [[state]] imposes it in [[principle]] only, and in its
performance the township resumes all its independent rights [[right]]. thus,
taxes are voted by the [[state]], but they are levied and collected by the
township; the existence of a school is obligatory, but the township
builds, pays [[pay]], and superintends it. in [[france]] the state-collector
receives the local imposts; in [[america]] the town-collector receives the
taxes of the [[state]]. thus the french [[government]] lends its agents to the
commune; in [[america]] the township is the agent of the [[government]]. this
fact alone shows the extent of the differences which [[exist]] between the
two nations.

public spirit of the townships of new england

how the township of new [[england]] wins the affections of its
inhabitants--difficulty of creating local [[public]] spirit in
europe--the rights [[right]] and duties [[duty]] of the american township favorable to
it--characteristics of [[home]] in the [[united]] states--manifestations of
public spirit in new england--its [[happy]] effects.

in [[america]], not only do municipal bodies [[body]] [[exist]], but they are kept alive
and supported by [[public]] spirit. the township of new [[england]] possesses
two advantages which infallibly secure the attentive interest of
mankind, namely, independence and [[authority]]. its sphere is indeed small
and limited, but within that sphere its action is unrestrained; and
its independence gives to it a real importance which its extent and
population may not always ensure.

it is to be remembered that the affections of [[men]] generally [[lie]] on the
side of [[authority]]. [[patriotism]] is not durable in a conquered nation. the
new englander is attached to his township, not only because he was born
in it, but because it constitutes a social [[body]] of which he is a member,
and whose [[government]] claims and deserves the exercise of his sagacity.
in [[europe]] the absence of local [[public]] spirit is a frequent [[subject]] of
regret to those who are in [[power]]; everyone agrees that there is no surer
guarantee of order and tranquility, and yet nothing is more difficult to
create. if the municipal bodies [[body]] were made powerful and independent,
the authorities [[authority]] of the nation might be disunited and the [[peace]] of the
country endangered. yet, without [[power]] and independence, a town may
contain [[good]] subjects [[subject]], but it can have no active [[citizens]]. another
important [[fact]] is that the township of new [[england]] is so constituted
as to excite the warmest of [[human]] affections, without arousing the
ambitious [[passions]] of the [[heart]] of [[man]]. the officers of the [[country]] are
not elected, and their [[authority]] is very limited. even the [[state]] is
only a second-rate [[community]], whose tranquil and obscure administration
offers no inducement sufficient to draw [[men]] away from the circle
of their interests into the turmoil of [[public]] affairs. the federal
government confers [[power]] and [[honor]] on the [[men]] who conduct it; but
these individuals [[individual]] can never be very numerous. the high station of the
presidency can only be reached at an advanced period of [[life]], and the
other federal functionaries are generally [[men]] who have been favored
by [[fortune]], or distinguished in some other [[career]]. such cannot be the
permanent aim of the ambitious. but the township serves as a centre for
the [[desire]] of [[public]] esteem, the want of exciting interests, and
the taste for [[authority]] and popularity, in the midst of the ordinary
relations of [[life]]; and the [[passions]] which commonly embroil society
change their [[character]] when they find a vent so near the domestic hearth
and the [[family]] circle.

in the american states [[power]] has been disseminated with admirable skill
for the [[purpose]] of interesting the [[greatest]] possible number of persons
in the [[common]] weal. independently of the electors who are from [[time]] to
time called into action, the [[body]] [[politic]] is divided into innumerable
functionaries and officers, who all, in their several spheres, represent
the same powerful whole in whose name they act. the local administration
thus affords an unfailing source of [[profit]] and interest to a vast number
of individuals [[individual]].

the american [[system]], which divides the local [[authority]] among so many
citizens, does not scruple to multiply the functions of the town
officers. for in the [[united]] states it is believed, and with [[truth]],
that [[patriotism]] is a [[kind]] of devotion which is strengthened by ritual
observance. in this manner the activity of the township is continually
perceptible; it is daily manifested in the fulfilment of a [[duty]] or the
exercise of a [[right]], and a constant though gentle motion is thus kept up
in [[society]] which animates without disturbing it.

the american attaches himself to his [[home]] as the mountaineer clings to
his hills, because the characteristic features of his [[country]] are there
more distinctly marked than elsewhere. the existence of the townships
of new [[england]] is in general a [[happy]] one. their [[government]] is suited
to their tastes, and chosen by themselves. in the midst of the profound
peace and general comfort which reign in [[america]] the commotions of
municipal discord are unfrequent. the conduct of local [[business]] is easy.
the [[political]] [[education]] of the [[people]] has long been complete; say rather
that it was complete when the [[people]] first set foot upon the soil. in
new [[england]] no tradition exists of a distinction of ranks; no portion of
the [[community]] is tempted to [[oppress]] the remainder; and the abuses [[abuse]] which
may injure isolated individuals [[individual]] are forgotten in the general contentment
which prevails. if the [[government]] is defective (and it would no doubt
be easy to point out its deficiencies), the [[fact]] that it really emanates
from those it governs, and that it acts, either ill or well, casts
the protecting spell of a parental [[pride]] over its faults [[fault]]. no term of
comparison disturbs the satisfaction of the citizen: [[england]] formerly
governed the mass of the colonies, but the [[people]] was always sovereign
in the township where its [[rule]] is not only an ancient but a primitive
state.

the native of new [[england]] is attached to his township because it is
independent and [[free]]: his co-operation in its affairs ensures his
attachment to its interest; the well-being it affords him secures his
affection; and its welfare is the aim of his [[ambition]] and of his
future exertions: he takes a part in every occurrence in the place; he
practises the art [[arts]] of [[government]] in the small sphere within his reach;
he accustoms himself to those forms which can alone ensure the steady
progress of [[liberty]]; he imbibes their spirit; he acquires a taste for
order, comprehends the union or the balance of powers [[power]], and collects
clear practical notions on the [[nature]] of his duties [[duty]] and the extent of
his rights [[right]].

the counties of new england

the division of the countries [[country]] in [[america]] has considerable analogy with
that of the arrondissements of [[france]]. the limits of the counties are
arbitrarily laid down, and the various districts which they contain have
no necessary connection, no [[common]] tradition or [[natural]] sympathy; their
object is simply to facilitate the administration of [[justice]].

the extent of the township was too small to contain a [[system]] of judicial
institutions; each county has, however, a court of [[justice]], *f a sheriff
to execute its decrees, and a prison for criminals [[criminal]]. there are certain
wants which are [[felt]] alike by all the townships of a county; it is
therefore [[natural]] that they should be satisfied by a central [[authority]].
in the [[state]] of massachusetts this [[authority]] is vested in the hands of
several magistrates, who are appointed by the governor of the [[state]],
with the [[advice]] *g of his council. *h the officers of the county have
only a limited and occasional [[authority]], which is applicable to certain
predetermined cases. the [[state]] and the townships possess all the power
requisite to conduct [[public]] [[business]]. the budget of the county is drawn
up by its officers, and is voted by the legislature, but there is no
assembly which directly or indirectly represents the county. it has,
therefore, properly speaking, no [[political]] existence.

[footnote f: see the act of february 14, 1821, laws [[law]] of massachusetts,
vol. i. p. 551.]

[footnote g: see the act of february 20, 1819, laws [[law]] of massachusetts,
vol. ii. p. 494.]

[footnote h: the council of the governor is an elective [[body]].] a twofold
tendency may be discerned in the american constitutions [[constitution]], which impels
the legislator to centralize the legislative and to disperse the
executive [[power]]. the township of new [[england]] has in itself an
indestructible element of independence; and this distinct existence
could only be fictitiously introduced into the county, where its
utility has not been [[felt]]. but all the townships [[united]] have but
one representation, which is the [[state]], the centre of the national
authority: beyond the action of the township and that of the nation,
nothing can be said to [[exist]] but the influence of [[individual]] exertion.

administration in new england

administration not perceived in america--why?--the europeans [[european]] believe
that [[liberty]] is promoted by depriving the social [[authority]] of some of
its rights [[right]]; the americans, by dividing its exercise--almost all the
administration confined to the township, and divided amongst the
town-officers--no trace of an administrative [[body]] to be perceived,
either in the township or above it--the [[reason]] of this--how it happens
that the administration of the [[state]] is uniform--who is empowered to
enforce the [[obedience]] of the township and the county to the law--the
introduction of judicial [[power]] into the administration--consequence
of the extension of the elective [[principle]] to all functionaries--the
justice of the [[peace]] in new england--by whom appointed--county officer:
ensures the administration of the townships--court of sessions--its
action--right of inspection and indictment disseminated like the other
administrative functions--informers encouraged by the division of fines.

nothing is more striking to an [[european]] traveller in the [[united]] states
than the absence of what we term the [[government]], or the administration.
written laws [[law]] [[exist]] in [[america]], and one sees that they are daily
executed; but although everything is in motion, the hand which gives the
impulse to the social machine can nowhere be discovered. nevertheless,
as all peoples [[people]] are obliged to have recourse to [[certain]] grammatical
forms, which are the foundation of [[human]] [[language]], in order to express
their thoughts [[thought]]; so all communities [[community]] are obliged to secure their existence
by submitting to a [[certain]] dose of [[authority]], without which they fall a
prey to [[anarchy]]. this [[authority]] may be distributed in several ways, but
it must always [[exist]] somewhere.

there are two methods of diminishing the [[force]] of [[authority]] in a nation:
the first is to weaken the supreme [[power]] in its very [[principle]], by
forbidding or preventing [[society]] from acting in its own defence under
certain circumstances. to weaken [[authority]] in this manner is what is
generally termed in [[europe]] to lay the foundations of [[freedom]]. the second
manner of diminishing the influence of [[authority]] does not consist in
stripping [[society]] of any of its rights [[right]], nor in paralyzing its efforts,
but in distributing the exercise of its privileges [[privilege]] in various hands,
and in multiplying functionaries, to each of whom the [[degree]] of power
necessary for him to perform his [[duty]] is entrusted. there may be nations
whom this distribution of social powers [[power]] might lead to [[anarchy]]; but in
itself it is not anarchical. the action of [[authority]] is indeed thus
rendered less irresistible and less perilous, but it is not totally
suppressed.

the [[revolution]] of the [[united]] states was the result of a mature and
dignified taste for [[freedom]], and not of a vague or ill-defined craving
for independence. it contracted no [[alliance]] with the turbulent passions
of [[anarchy]]; but its course was marked, on the contrary, by an attachment
to whatever was lawful and orderly.

it was never assumed in the [[united]] states that the citizen of a free
country has a [[right]] to do whatever he pleases; on the contrary, social
obligations were there imposed upon him more various than anywhere
else. no [[idea]] was ever entertained of attacking the principles [[principle]] or of
contesting the rights [[right]] of [[society]]; but the exercise of its [[authority]] was
divided, to the end that the office might be powerful and the officer
insignificant, and that the [[community]] should be at once regulated
and [[free]]. in no [[country]] in the [[world]] does the [[law]] hold so absolute a
language as in [[america]], and in no [[country]] is the [[right]] of applying it
vested in so many hands. the administrative [[power]] in the [[united]] states
presents nothing either central or hierarchical in its [[constitution]],
which accounts for its passing, unperceived. the [[power]] exists, but its
representative is not to be perceived.

we have already seen that the independent townships of new england
protect their own private interests; and the municipal magistrates
are the persons [[person]] to whom the execution of the laws [[law]] of the [[state]] is most
frequently entrusted. *i besides the general laws [[law]], the [[state]] sometimes
passes general [[police]] regulations; but more commonly the townships and
town officers, conjointly with justices of the [[peace]], regulate the minor
details of social [[life]], according to the necessities of the different
localities, and promulgate such enactments as concern the health of the
community, and the [[peace]] as well as morality of the [[citizens]]. *j lastly,
these municipal magistrates provide, of their own accord and without
any delegated powers [[power]], for those unforeseen emergencies which frequently
occur in [[society]]. *k

[footnote i: see "the town-officer," especially at the words selectmen,
assessors, collectors, schools, surveyors of highways. i take one
example in a thousand: the [[state]] prohibits travelling on the sunday; the
tything-men, who are town-officers, are specially charged to keep watch
and to execute the [[law]]. see the laws [[law]] of massachusetts, vol. i. p. 410.

the selectmen draw up the lists of electors for the election of the
governor, and transmit the result of the ballot to the secretary of the
state. see act of february 24, 1796: id., vol. i. p. 488.]

[footnote j: thus, for instance, the selectmen authorize the
construction of drains, point out the proper sites for slaughter-houses
and other trades [[trade]] which are a nuisance to the neighborhood. see the act
of june 7, 1785: id., vol. i. p. 193.]

[footnote k: the selectmen take measures for the security of the public
in case of contagious diseases, conjointly with the justices of the
peace. see act of june 22, 1797, vol. i. p. 539.]

it results from what we have said that in the [[state]] of massachusetts the
administrative [[authority]] is almost entirely restricted to the township,
*l but that it is distributed among a [[great]] number of individuals [[individual]].
in the french commune there is properly but one official functionary,
namely, the maire; and in new [[england]] we have seen that there are
nineteen. these nineteen functionaries do not in general depend upon
one another. the [[law]] carefully prescribes a circle of action to each of
these magistrates; and within that circle they have an entire [[right]] to
perform their functions independently of any other [[authority]]. above the
township scarcely any trace of a series of official dignitaries is to be
found. it sometimes happens that the county officers alter a decision of
the townships or town magistrates, *m but in general the authorities
of the county have no [[right]] to interfere with the authorities [[authority]] of the
township, *n except in such matters as concern the county.

[footnote l: i say almost, for there are various circumstances in the
annals of a township which are regulated by the [[justice]] of the [[peace]] in
his [[individual]] capacity, or by the justices of the [[peace]] assembled in
the [[chief]] town of the county; thus licenses are granted by the justices.
see the act of february 28, 1787, vol. i. p. 297.]

[footnote m: thus licenses are only granted to such persons [[person]] as can
produce a certificate of [[good]] conduct from the selectmen. if the
selectmen refuse to give the certificate, the party may appeal to the
justices assembled in the court of sessions, and they may grant the
license. see act of march 12, 1808, vol. ii. p. 186.

the townships have the [[right]] to make by-laws, and to enforce them by
fines which are fixed by [[law]]; but these by-laws must be approved by the
court of sessions. see act of march 23, 1786, vol. i. p. 254.]

[footnote n: in massachusetts the county magistrates are frequently
called upon to investigate the acts of the town magistrates; but it will
be shown further on that this investigation is a consequence, not of
their administrative, but of their judicial [[power]].]

the magistrates of the township, as well as those of the county, are
bound to communicate their acts to the central [[government]] in a very
small number of predetermined cases. *o but the central [[government]] is
not represented by an [[individual]] whose [[business]] it is to publish police
regulations and ordinances enforcing the execution of the laws [[law]]; to keep
up a regular communication with the officers of the township and
the county; to inspect their conduct, to direct their actions, or to
reprimand their faults [[fault]]. there is no point which serves as a centre to
the radii of the administration.

[footnote o: the town committees of schools are obliged to make an
annual report to the secretary of the [[state]] on the condition of the
school. see act of march 10, 1827, vol. iii. p. 183.]




chapter v: necessity of examining the condition of the states--part ii

what, then, is the uniform plan on which the [[government]] is conducted,
and how is the compliance of the counties and their magistrates or the
townships and their officers enforced? in the states of new [[england]] the
legislative [[authority]] embraces more subjects [[subject]] than it does in [[france]]; the
legislator penetrates to the very core of the administration; the law
descends to the most minute details; the same enactment prescribes
the [[principle]] and the method of its application, and thus imposes a
multitude of strict and rigorously defined obligations on the secondary
functionaries of the [[state]]. the consequence of this is that if all
the secondary functionaries of the administration conform to the [[law]],
society in all its branches proceeds with the [[greatest]] uniformity: the
difficulty remains of compelling the secondary functionaries of the
administration to conform to the [[law]]. it may be affirmed that, in
general, [[society]] has only two methods of enforcing the execution of
the laws [[law]] at its disposal: a discretionary [[power]] may be entrusted to a
superior functionary of directing all the others, and of cashiering them
in case of disobedience; or the courts of [[justice]] may be authorized to
inflict judicial penalties on the offender: but these two methods are
not always available.

the [[right]] of directing a civil officer presupposes that of cashiering
him if he does not obey orders, and of rewarding him by promotion if he
fulfils his duties [[duty]] with propriety. but an elected magistrate can neither
be cashiered nor promoted. all elective functions are inalienable until
their term is expired. in [[fact]], the elected magistrate has nothing
either to expect or to [[fear]] from his constituents; and when all
public offices are filled by ballot there can be no series of official
dignities, because the double [[right]] of commanding and of enforcing
obedience can never be vested in the same [[individual]], and because the
power of issuing an order can never be joined to that of inflicting a
punishment or bestowing a [[reward]].

the communities [[community]] therefore in which the secondary functionaries of
the [[government]] are elected are perforce obliged to make [[great]] use of
judicial penalties as a means of administration. this is not evident at
first sight; for those in [[power]] are apt to look upon the institution
of elective functionaries as one concession, and the subjection of
the elected magistrate to the judges [[judge]] of the [[land]] as another. they
are equally averse to both these innovations; and as they are more
pressingly solicited to grant the former than the latter, they accede
to the election of the magistrate, and leave him independent of the
judicial [[power]]. nevertheless, the second of these measures is the only
thing that can possibly counterbalance the first; and it will be found
that an elective [[authority]] which is not [[subject]] to judicial [[power]] will,
sooner or later, either elude all control or be destroyed. the courts of
justice are the only possible medium between the central [[power]] and the
administrative bodies [[body]]; they alone can compel the elected functionary
to obey, without violating the rights [[right]] of the elector. the extension of
judicial [[power]] in the [[political]] [[world]] ought therefore to be in the exact
ratio of the extension of elective offices: if these two institutions
do not go hand in hand, the [[state]] must fall into [[anarchy]] or into
subjection.

it has always been remarked that habits of legal [[business]] do not render
men apt to the exercise of administrative [[authority]]. the americans have
borrowed from the english, their fathers [[father]], the [[idea]] of an institution
which is unknown upon the continent of [[europe]]: i allude to that of
the justices of the [[peace]]. the [[justice]] of the [[peace]] is a sort of mezzo
termine between the magistrate and the [[man]] of the [[world]], between the
civil officer and the [[judge]]. a [[justice]] of the [[peace]] is a well-informed
citizen, though he is not necessarily versed in the [[knowledge]] of the
laws. his office simply obliges him to execute the [[police]] regulations of
society; a task in which [[good]] sense and integrity are of more avail than
legal [[science]]. the [[justice]] introduces into the administration a certain
taste for established forms and publicity, which renders him a most
unserviceable instrument of despotism; and, on the other hand, he is not
blinded by those superstitions which render legal officers unfit members
of a [[government]]. the americans have adopted the [[system]] of the english
justices of the [[peace]], but they have deprived it of that aristocratic
character which is discernible in the mother-country. the governor of
massachusetts *p appoints a [[certain]] number of justices of the [[peace]] in
every county, whose functions [[last]] seven years. *q he further designates
three individuals [[individual]] from amongst the whole [[body]] of justices who form in
each county what is called the court of sessions. the justices take a
personal share in [[public]] [[business]]; they are sometimes entrusted with
administrative functions in conjunction with elected officers, *r they
sometimes constitute a tribunal, before which the magistrates summarily
prosecute a refractory citizen, or the [[citizens]] inform against the
abuses of the magistrate. but it is in the court of sessions that they
exercise their most important functions. this court meets twice a year
in the county town; in massachusetts it is empowered to enforce the
obedience of the greater number *s of [[public]] officers. *t it must be
observed, that in the [[state]] of massachusetts the court of sessions is
at the same [[time]] an administrative [[body]], properly so called, and a
political tribunal. it has been asserted that the county is a purely
administrative division. the court of sessions presides over that small
number of affairs which, as they concern several townships, or all the
townships of the county in [[common]], cannot be entrusted to any one of
them in particular. *u in all that concerns county [[business]] the duties
of the court of sessions are purely administrative; and if in its
investigations it occasionally borrows the forms of judicial procedure,
it is only with a view to its own information, *v or as a guarantee to
the [[community]] over which it presides. but when the administration of the
township is brought before it, it always acts as a judicial [[body]], and in
some few cases as an official assembly.

[footnote p: we shall hereafter learn what a governor is: i shall
content myself with remarking in this place that he represents the
executive [[power]] of the whole [[state]].]

[footnote q: see the [[constitution]] of massachusetts, chap. ii. sect. 1.
section 9; chap. iii. section 3.]

[footnote r: thus, for [[example]], a stranger arrives in a township from
a [[country]] where a contagious disease prevails, and he falls ill. two
justices of the [[peace]] can, with the assent of the selectmen, order the
sheriff of the county to remove and take [[care]] of him.--act of june 22,
1797, vol. i. p. 540.

in general the justices interfere in all the important acts of the
administration, and give them a semi-judicial [[character]].] [footnote s: i
say the greater number, because [[certain]] administrative misdemeanors are
brought before ordinary tribunals. if, for instance, a township
refuses to make the necessary expenditure for its schools or to name
a school-committee, it is liable to a heavy fine. but this penalty is
pronounced by the supreme judicial court or the court of [[common]] pleas.
see act of march 10, 1827, laws [[law]] of massachusetts, vol. iii. p. 190. or
when a township neglects to provide the necessary war-stores.--act of
february 21, 1822: id., vol. ii. p. 570.]

[footnote t: in their [[individual]] capacity the justices of the peace
take a part in the [[business]] of the counties and townships.] [footnote u:
these affairs may be brought under the following heads:--1. the erection
of prisons and courts of [[justice]]. 2. the county budget, which is
afterwards voted by the [[state]]. 3. the distribution of the taxes so
voted. 4. grants of [[certain]] patents. 5. the laying down and repairs of
the [[country]] roads.]

[footnote v: thus, when a road is under consideration, almost all
difficulties are disposed of by the aid of the jury.]

the first difficulty is to procure the [[obedience]] of an [[authority]] as
entirely independent of the general laws [[law]] of the [[state]] as the
township is. we have stated that assessors are annually named by the
town-meetings to levy the taxes. if a township attempts to evade the
payment of the taxes by neglecting to name its assessors, the court of
sessions condemns it to a heavy penalty. *w the fine is levied on each
of the inhabitants; and the sheriff of the county, who is the officer of
justice, executes the mandate. thus it is that in the [[united]] states the
authority of the [[government]] is mysteriously concealed under the forms of
a judicial sentence; and its influence is at the same [[time]] fortified by
that irresistible [[power]] with which [[men]] have invested the formalities of
law.

[footnote w: see act of february 20, 1786, laws [[law]] of massachusetts, vol.
i. p. 217.]

these proceedings are easy to [[follow]] and to [[understand]]. the demands
made upon a township are in general plain and accurately defined; they
consist in a simple [[fact]] without any complication, or in a principle
without its application in detail. *x but the difficulty increases when
it is not the [[obedience]] of the township, but that of the town officers
which is to be enforced. all the reprehensible actions of which a public
functionary may be guilty are reducible to the following heads:

[footnote x: there is an indirect method of enforcing the [[obedience]] of
a township. suppose that the funds which the [[law]] demands for the
maintenance of the roads have not been voted, the town surveyor is
then authorized, ex officio, to levy the supplies. as he is personally
responsible to private individuals [[individual]] for the [[state]] of the roads, and
indictable before the court of sessions, he is sure to employ the
extraordinary [[right]] which the [[law]] gives him against the township. thus
by threatening the officer the court of sessions exacts compliance from
the town. see act of march 5, 1787, id., vol. i. p. 305.]

he may execute the [[law]] without energy or zeal;

he may neglect to execute the [[law]];

he may do what the [[law]] enjoins him not to do.

the [[last]] two violations of [[duty]] can alone come under the cognizance of
a tribunal; a positive and appreciable [[fact]] is the indispensable
foundation of an action at [[law]]. thus, if the selectmen omit to fulfil
the legal formalities usual at town elections, they may be condemned
to [[pay]] a fine; *y but when the [[public]] officer performs his [[duty]] without
ability, and when he obeys the letter of the [[law]] without zeal or energy,
he is at least beyond the reach of judicial interference. the court of
sessions, even when it is invested with its official powers [[power]], is in this
case unable to compel him to a more satisfactory [[obedience]]. the [[fear]] of
removal is the only check to these quasi-offences; and as the court
of sessions does not originate the town authorities [[authority]], it cannot
remove functionaries whom it does not appoint. moreover, a perpetual
investigation would be necessary to convict the officer of negligence or
lukewarmness; and the court of sessions sits but twice a year and then
only judges [[judge]] such offences as are brought before its notice. the only
security of that active and enlightened [[obedience]] which a court of
justice cannot impose upon [[public]] officers lies [[lie]] in the possibility of
their arbitrary removal. in [[france]] this security is sought for in powers
exercised by the heads of the administration; in [[america]] it is sought
for in the [[principle]] of election.

[footnote y: laws [[law]] of massachusetts, vol. ii. p. 45.]

thus, to recapitulate in a few words what i have been showing: if a
public officer in new [[england]] commits a crime in the exercise of his
functions, the ordinary courts of [[justice]] are always called upon to pass
sentence upon him. if he commits a [[fault]] in his official capacity, a
purely administrative tribunal is empowered to punish him; and, if the
affair is important or urgent, the [[judge]] supplies the omission of the
functionary. *z lastly, if the same [[individual]] is guilty of one of
those intangible offences of which [[human]] [[justice]] has no cognizance, he
annually appears before a tribunal from which there is no appeal, which
can at once reduce him to insignificance and deprive him of his charge.
this [[system]] undoubtedly possesses [[great]] advantages, but its execution is
attended with a practical difficulty which it is important to point out.

[footnote z: if, for instance, a township persists in refusing to name
its assessors, the court of sessions nominates them; and the magistrates
thus appointed are invested with the same [[authority]] as elected officers.
see the act quoted above, february 20, 1787.]

i have already observed that the administrative tribunal, which is
called the court of sessions, has no [[right]] of inspection over the town
officers. it can only interfere when the conduct of a magistrate is
specially brought under its notice; and this is the delicate part of the
system. the americans of new [[england]] are unacquainted with the office
of [[public]] prosecutor in the court of sessions, *a and it may readily be
perceived that it could not have been established without difficulty.
if an accusing magistrate had merely been appointed in the [[chief]] town of
each county, and if he had been unassisted by agents in the townships,
he would not have been [[better]] acquainted with what was going on in the
county than the members of the court of sessions. but to appoint agents
in each township would have been to centre in his [[person]] the most
formidable of powers [[power]], that of a judicial administration. moreover,
laws are the [[children]] of habit, and nothing of the [[kind]] exists in the
legislation of [[england]]. the americans have therefore divided the offices
of inspection and of prosecution, as well as all the other functions
of the administration. grand jurors are bound by the [[law]] to apprise the
court to which they belong of all the misdemeanors which may have been
committed in their county. *b there are [[certain]] [[great]] offences which are
officially prosecuted by the states; *c but more frequently the task of
punishing delinquents devolves upon the fiscal officer, whose province
it is to receive the fine: thus the treasurer of the township is charged
with the prosecution of such administrative offences as fall under his
notice. but a more special appeal is made by american legislation to
the private interest of the citizen; *d and this [[great]] [[principle]] is
constantly to be met with in studying the laws [[law]] of the [[united]] states.
american legislators are more apt to give [[men]] credit for intelligence
than for honesty, and they rely not a little on personal cupidity for
the execution of the laws [[law]]. when an [[individual]] is really and sensibly
injured by an administrative [[abuse]], it is [[natural]] that his personal
interest should induce him to prosecute. but if a legal formality be
required, which, however advantageous to the [[community]], is of small
importance to individuals [[individual]], plaintiffs may be less easily found; and
thus, by a tacit agreement, the laws [[law]] may fall into disuse. reduced by
their [[system]] to this extremity, the americans are obliged to encourage
informers by bestowing on them a portion of the penalty in certain
cases, *e and to insure the execution of the laws [[law]] by the dangerous
expedient of degrading the morals [[moral]] of the [[people]]. the only administrative
authority above the county magistrates is, properly speaking, that of
the [[government]].

[footnote a: i say the court of sessions, because in [[common]] courts
there is a magistrate who exercises some of the functions of a public
prosecutor.]

[footnote b: the grand-jurors are, for instance, bound to inform the
court of the [[bad]] [[state]] of the roads.--laws of massachusetts, vol. i. p.
308.]

[footnote c: if, for instance, the treasurer of the county holds back
his accounts.--laws of massachusetts, vol. i. p. 406.] [footnote d:
thus, if a private [[individual]] breaks down or is wounded in consequence
of the badness of a road, he can sue the township or the county for
damages at the sessions.--laws of massachusetts, vol. i. p. 309.]

[footnote e: in cases of [[invasion]] or insurrection, if the town-officers
neglect to furnish the necessary stores and ammunition for the militia,
the township may be condemned to a fine of from $200 to $500. it may
readily be imagined that in such a case it might happen that no one
cared to prosecute; hence the [[law]] adds that all the [[citizens]] may indict
offences of this [[kind]], and that half of the fine shall belong to the
plaintiff. see act of march 6, 1810, vol. ii. p. 236. the same clause
is frequently to be met with in the [[law]] of massachusetts. not only are
private individuals [[individual]] thus incited to prosecute the [[public]] officers,
but the [[public]] officers are encouraged in the same manner to bring the
disobedience of private individuals [[individual]] to [[justice]]. if a citizen refuses to
perform the [[work]] which has been assigned to him upon a road, the
road surveyor may prosecute him, and he receives half the penalty for
himself. see the laws [[law]] above quoted, vol. i. p. 308.]

general remarks on the administration of the [[united]] states differences
of the states of the union in their [[system]] of administration--activity
and [[perfection]] of the local authorities [[authority]] decrease towards the
south--power of the magistrate increases; that of the elector
diminishes--administration passes from the township to the
county--states of new york, ohio, pennsylvania--principles of
administration applicable to the whole union--election of public
officers, and inalienability of their functions--absence of gradation of
ranks--introduction of judicial resources into the administration.


i have already premised that, after having examined the [[constitution]] of
the township and the county of new [[england]] in detail, i should take
a general view of the remainder of the union. townships and a local
activity [[exist]] in every [[state]]; but in no part of the confederation is a
township to be met with precisely similar to those of new [[england]]. the
more we descend towards the south, the less active does the [[business]] of
the township or parish become; the number of magistrates, of functions,
and of rights [[right]] decreases; the [[population]] exercises a less immediate
influence on affairs; town meetings are less frequent, and the subjects
of debate less numerous. the [[power]] of the elected magistrate is
augmented and that of the elector diminished, whilst the [[public]] spirit
of the local communities [[community]] is less awakened and less influential. *f these
differences may be perceived to a [[certain]] extent in the [[state]] of new
york; they are very sensible in pennsylvania; but they become less
striking as we advance to the northwest. the majority of the emigrants
who settle in the northwestern states are natives of new [[england]], and
they carry the habits of their [[mother]] [[country]] with them into that which
they adopt. a township in ohio is by no means dissimilar from a township
in massachusetts.

[footnote f: for details see the revised statutes of the [[state]] of new
york, part i. chap. xi. vol. i. pp. 336-364, entitled, "of the powers [[power]],
duties, and privileges [[privilege]] of towns."

see in the digest of the laws [[law]] of pennsylvania, the words assessors,
collector, constables, overseer of the [[poor]], supervisors of highways;
and in the acts of a general [[nature]] of the [[state]] of ohio, the act of
february 25, 1834, relating to townships, p. 412; besides the peculiar
dispositions relating to divers town-officers, such as township's clerk,
trustees, overseers of the [[poor]], fence viewers, appraisers of [[property]],
township's treasurer, constables, supervisors of highways.]

we have seen that in massachusetts the mainspring of public
administration lies [[lie]] in the township. it forms the [[common]] centre of the
interests and affections of the [[citizens]]. but this ceases to be the case
as we descend to states in which [[knowledge]] is less generally diffused,
and where the township consequently offers fewer guarantees of a wise
and active administration. as we leave new [[england]], therefore, we find
that the importance of the town is gradually transferred to the county,
which becomes the centre of administration, and the intermediate power
between the [[government]] and the citizen. in massachusetts the [[business]] of
the county is conducted by the court of sessions, which is composed of
a quorum named by the governor and his council; but the county has no
representative assembly, and its expenditure is voted by the national
legislature. in the [[great]] [[state]] of new york, on the contrary, and in
those of ohio and pennsylvania, the inhabitants of each county choose
a [[certain]] number of representatives, who constitute the assembly of the
county. *g the county assembly has the [[right]] of taxing the inhabitants
to a [[certain]] extent; and in this [[respect]] it enjoys the privileges [[privilege]] of a
real legislative [[body]]: at the same [[time]] it exercises an executive power
in the county, frequently directs the administration of the townships,
and restricts their [[authority]] within much narrower bounds than in
massachusetts.

[footnote g: see the revised statutes of the [[state]] of new york, part i.
chap. xi. vol. i. p. 340. id. chap. xii. p. 366; also in the acts of
the [[state]] of ohio, an act relating to county commissioners, february 25,
1824, p. 263. see the digest of the laws [[law]] of pennsylvania, at the words
county-rates and levies, p. 170. in the [[state]] of new york each township
elects a representative, who has a share in the administration of the
county as well as in that of the township.]

such are the principal differences which the systems [[system]] of county and town
administration [[present]] in the federal states. were it my intention to
examine the provisions of american [[law]] minutely, i should have to point
out still further differences in the executive details of the several
communities. but what i have already said may suffice to show the
general principles [[principle]] on which the administration of the [[united]] states
rests. these principles [[principle]] are differently applied; their consequences
are more or less numerous in various localities; but they are always
substantially the same. the laws [[law]] differ, and their outward features
change, but their [[character]] does not vary. if the township and the
county are not everywhere constituted in the same manner, it is at least
true that in the [[united]] states the county and the township are always
based upon the same [[principle]], namely, that everyone is the [[best]] judge
of what concerns himself alone, and the most proper [[person]] to supply his
private wants. the township and the county are therefore bound to take
care of their special interests: the [[state]] governs, but it does not
interfere with their administration. exceptions to this [[rule]] may be met
with, but not a contrary [[principle]].

the first consequence of this doctrine has been to cause all the
magistrates to be chosen either by or at least from amongst the
citizens. as the officers are everywhere elected or appointed for a
certain period, it has been impossible to establish the rules [[rule]] of a
dependent series of authorities [[authority]]; there are almost as many independent
functionaries as there are functions, and the executive [[power]] is
disseminated in a multitude of hands. hence arose the indispensable
necessity of introducing the control of the courts of [[justice]] over the
administration, and the [[system]] of pecuniary penalties, by which the
secondary bodies [[body]] and their representatives are constrained to obey the
laws. this [[system]] obtains from one end of the union to the other. the
power of punishing the misconduct of [[public]] officers, or of performing
the part of the executive in urgent cases, has not, however, been
bestowed on the same judges [[judge]] in all the states. the anglo-americans
derived the institution of justices of the [[peace]] from a [[common]] source;
but although it exists in all the states, it is not always turned to
the same use. the justices of the [[peace]] everywhere participate in the
administration of the townships and the counties, *h either as public
officers or as the judges [[judge]] of [[public]] misdemeanors, but in most of the
states the more important classes of [[public]] offences come under the
cognizance of the ordinary tribunals.

[footnote h: in some of the southern states the county courts are
charged with all the details of the administration. see the statutes of
the [[state]] of tennessee, [[arts]]. judiciary, taxes, etc.]

the election of [[public]] officers, or the inalienability of their
functions, the absence of a gradation of powers [[power]], and the introduction
of a judicial control over the secondary branches of the administration,
are the universal characteristics of the american [[system]] from maine to
the floridas. in some states (and that of new york has advanced most
in this direction) traces of a centralized administration begin to
be discernible. in the [[state]] of new york the officers of the central
government exercise, in [[certain]] cases, a sort of inspection or control
over the secondary bodies [[body]]. *i

[footnote i: for instance, the direction of [[public]] instruction centres
in the hands of the [[government]]. the legislature names the members of
the [[university]], who are denominated regents; the governor
and lieutentant-governor of the [[state]] are necessarily of the
number.--revised statutes, vol. i. p. 455. the regents of the university
annually visit the colleges and academies, and make their report to
the legislature. their superintendence is not inefficient, for several
reasons: the colleges in order to become corporations stand in need of
a charter, which is only granted on the recommendation of the regents;
every year funds are distributed by the [[state]] for the encouragement of
learning, and the regents are the distributors of this [[money]]. see chap.
xv. "instruction," revised statutes, vol. i. p. 455.

the school-commissioners are obliged to send an annual report to the
superintendent of the [[republic]].--id. p. 488.

a similar report is annually made to the same [[person]] on the number and
condition of the [[poor]].--id. p. 631.]

at other times [[time]] they constitute a court of appeal for the decision of
affairs. *j in the [[state]] of new york judicial penalties are less used
than in other parts as a means of administration, and the [[right]] of
prosecuting the offences of [[public]] officers is vested in fewer hands. *k
the same tendency is faintly observable in some other states; *l but in
general the prominent feature of the administration in the [[united]] states
is its excessive local independence.

[footnote j: if any one conceives himself to be wronged by the
school-commissioners (who are town-officers), he can appeal to the
superintendent of the primary schools, whose decision is final.--revised
statutes, vol. i. p. 487.

provisions similar to those above cited are to be met with from [[time]] to
time in the laws [[law]] of the [[state]] of new york; but in general these attempts
at centralization are [[weak]] and unproductive. the [[great]] authorities [[authority]] of
the [[state]] have the [[right]] of watching and controlling the subordinate
agents, without that of rewarding or punishing them. the same individual
is never empowered to give an order and to punish disobedience; he
has therefore the [[right]] of commanding, without the means of exacting
compliance. in 1830 the superintendent of schools complained in
his annual report addressed to the legislature that several
school-commissioners had neglected, notwithstanding his application,
to furnish him with the accounts which were due. he added that if this
omission continued he should be obliged to prosecute them, as the law
directs, before the proper tribunals.]

[footnote k: thus the district-attorney is directed to recover all fines
below the sum of fifty dollars, unless such a [[right]] has been specially
awarded to another magistrate.--revised statutes, vol. i. p. 383.]

[footnote l: several traces of centralization may be discovered in
massachusetts; for instance, the committees of the town-schools are
directed to make an annual report to the secretary of [[state]]. see laws [[law]] of
massachusetts, vol. i. p. 367.]

of the state

i have described the townships and the administration; it now remains
for me to speak of the [[state]] and the [[government]]. this is ground i may
pass over rapidly, without [[fear]] of being misunderstood; for all i have
to say is to be found in written forms of the various constitutions [[constitution]],
which are easily to be procured. these constitutions [[constitution]] rest upon a simple
and [[rational]] theory; their forms have been adopted by all constitutional
nations, and are become familiar to us. in this place, therefore, it
is only necessary for me to give a short analysis; i shall endeavor
afterwards to pass [[judgment]] upon what i now describe.




chapter v: necessity of examining the condition of the states--part iii

legislative [[power]] of the state

division of the legislative [[body]] into two houses--senate--house of
representatives--different functions of these two bodies [[body]].

the legislative [[power]] of the [[state]] is vested in two assemblies, the
first of which generally bears the name of the senate. the senate is
commonly a legislative [[body]]; but it sometimes becomes an executive
and judicial one. it takes a part in the [[government]] in several ways,
according to the [[constitution]] of the different states; *m but it is in
the nomination of [[public]] functionaries that it most commonly assumes an
executive [[power]]. it partakes of judicial [[power]] in the [[trial]] of certain
political offences, and sometimes also in the decision of [[certain]] civil
cases. *n the number of its members is always small. the other branch of
the legislature, which is usually called the house of representatives,
has no share whatever in the administration, and only takes a part in
the judicial [[power]] inasmuch as it impeaches [[public]] functionaries before
the senate. the members of the two houses are nearly everywhere subject
to the same conditions of election. they are chosen in the same manner,
and by the same [[citizens]]. the only difference which exists between them
is, that the term for which the senate is chosen is in general longer
than that of the house of representatives. the latter seldom remain in
office longer than a year; the former usually sit two or three years.
by granting to the senators the [[privilege]] of being chosen for several
years, and being renewed seriatim, the [[law]] takes [[care]] to preserve in the
legislative [[body]] a nucleus of [[men]] already accustomed to [[public]] [[business]],
and capable of exercising a salutary influence upon the junior members.

[footnote m: in massachusetts the senate is not invested with any
administrative functions.]

[footnote n: as in the [[state]] of new york.]

the americans, plainly, did not [[desire]], by this separation of the
legislative [[body]] into two branches, to make one house hereditary and the
other elective; one aristocratic and the other democratic. it was not
their object to create in the one a bulwark to [[power]], whilst the
other represented the interests and [[passions]] of the [[people]]. the only
advantages which result from the [[present]] [[constitution]] of the united
states are the division of the legislative [[power]] and the consequent
check upon [[political]] assemblies; with the creation of a tribunal of
appeal for the revision of the laws [[law]].

time and [[experience]], however, have convinced the americans that if these
are its only advantages, the division of the legislative [[power]] is still
a [[principle]] of the [[greatest]] necessity. pennsylvania was the only one of
the [[united]] states which at first attempted to establish a single
house of assembly, and franklin himself was so far carried away by the
necessary consequences of the [[principle]] of the sovereignty of the people
as to have concurred in the measure; but the pennsylvanians were soon
obliged to [[change]] the [[law]], and to create two houses. thus the principle
of the division of the legislative [[power]] was finally established, and
its necessity may henceforward be regarded as a demonstrated [[truth]]. this
theory, which was nearly unknown to the republics [[republic]] of antiquity--which
was introduced into the [[world]] almost by accident, like so many other
great truths--and misunderstood by several [[modern]] nations, is at length
become an axiom in the [[political]] [[science]] of the [[present]] [[age]].

[see benjamin franklin]

the executive [[power]] of the state

office of governor in an american state--the place he occupies in
relation to the legislature--his rights [[right]] and his duties--his dependence
on the [[people]].

the executive [[power]] of the [[state]] may with [[truth]] be said to be
represented by the governor, although he enjoys but a portion of its
rights. the supreme magistrate, under the title of governor, is the
official moderator and counsellor of the legislature. he is armed with
a veto or suspensive [[power]], which allows him to stop, or at least to
retard, its movements at [[pleasure]]. he lays the wants of the country
before the legislative [[body]], and points out the means which he thinks
may be usefully employed in providing for them; he is the natural
executor of its decrees in all the undertakings which interest the
nation at large. *o in the absence of the legislature, the governor is
bound to take all necessary steps to guard the [[state]] against violent
shocks and unforeseen dangers. the whole [[military]] [[power]] of the [[state]] is
at the disposal of the governor. he is the commander of the militia, and
head of the armed [[force]]. when the [[authority]], which is by general consent
awarded to the laws [[law]], is disregarded, the governor puts himself at
the head of the armed [[force]] of the [[state]], to quell [[resistance]], and to
restore order. lastly, the governor takes no share in the administration
of townships and counties, except it be indirectly in the nomination of
justices of the [[peace]], which nomination he has not the [[power]] to cancel.
*p the governor is an elected magistrate, and is generally chosen
for one or two years only; so that he always continues to be strictly
dependent upon the majority who returned him.

[footnote o: practically speaking, it is not always the governor who
executes the plans of the legislature; it often happens that the latter,
in voting a measure, names special agents to superintend the execution
of it.]

[footnote p: in some of the states the justices of the [[peace]] are not

political effects of the [[system]] of local administration in the united
states

necessary distinction between the general centralization of government
and the centralization of the local administration--local administration
not centralized in the [[united]] states: [[great]] general centralization of
the government--some [[bad]] consequences resulting to the [[united]] states
from the local administration--administrative advantages attending
this order of things--the [[power]] which conducts the [[government]] is less
regular, less enlightened, less learned, but much greater than in
europe--political advantages of this order of things--in the united
states the interests of the [[country]] are everywhere kept in view--support
given to the [[government]] by the community--provincial institutions
more necessary in proportion as the social condition becomes more
democratic--reason of this.

centralization is become a word of general and daily use, without any
precise meaning being attached to it. nevertheless, there [[exist]] two
distinct kinds [[kind]] of centralization, which it is necessary to discriminate
with accuracy. [[certain]] interests are [[common]] to all parts of a nation,
such as the enactment of its general laws [[law]] and the maintenance of its
foreign relations. other interests are peculiar to [[certain]] parts of the
nation; such, for instance, as the [[business]] of different townships. when
the [[power]] which directs the general interests is centred in one place,
or vested in the same persons [[person]], it constitutes a central [[government]].
in like manner the [[power]] of directing partial or local interests,
when brought together into one place, constitutes what may be termed a
central administration.

upon some points these two kinds [[kind]] of centralization coalesce; but by
classifying the objects which fall more particularly within the province
of each of them, they may easily be distinguished. it is evident that a
central [[government]] acquires immense [[power]] when [[united]] to administrative
centralization. thus combined, it accustoms [[men]] to set their own will
habitually and completely aside; to submit, not only for once, or upon
one point, but in every [[respect]], and at all times [[time]]. not only, therefore,
does this union of [[power]] subdue them compulsorily, but it affects them
in the ordinary habits of [[life]], and influences each [[individual]], first
separately and then collectively.

these two kinds [[kind]] of centralization mutually assist and attract each
other; but they must not be supposed to be inseparable. it is impossible
to imagine a more completely central [[government]] than that which existed
in [[france]] under louis xiv.; when the same [[individual]] was the author and
the interpreter of the laws [[law]], and the representative of [[france]] at home
and abroad, he was justified in asserting that the [[state]] was identified
with his [[person]]. nevertheless, the administration was much less
centralized under louis xiv. than it is at the [[present]] day.

in [[england]] the centralization of the [[government]] is carried to great
perfection; the [[state]] has the compact vigor of a [[man]], and by the
sole act of its will it puts immense engines in motion, and wields or
collects the efforts of its [[authority]]. indeed, i cannot conceive that
a nation can enjoy a secure or prosperous existence without a powerful
centralization of [[government]]. but i am of [[opinion]] that a central
administration enervates the nations in which it exists by incessantly
diminishing their [[public]] spirit. if such an administration succeeds
in condensing at a given moment, on a given point, all the disposable
resources of a [[people]], it impairs at least the renewal of those
resources. it may ensure a [[victory]] in the hour of strife, but it
gradually relaxes the sinews of [[strength]]. it may contribute admirably
to the transient greatness of a [[man]], but it cannot ensure the durable
prosperity of a nation.

if we [[pay]] proper attention, we shall find that whenever it is said
that a [[state]] cannot act because it has no central point, it is the
centralization of the [[government]] in which it is deficient. it is
frequently asserted, and we are prepared to assent to the proposition,
that the [[german]] [[empire]] was never able to bring all its powers [[power]] into
action. but the [[reason]] was, that the [[state]] was never able to enforce
obedience to its general laws [[law]], because the several members of that great
body always claimed the [[right]], or found the means, of refusing their
co-operation to the representatives of the [[common]] [[authority]], even in the
affairs which concerned the mass of the [[people]]; in other words, because
there was no centralization of [[government]]. the same remark is applicable
to the middle ages [[age]]; the cause of all the confusion of feudal society
was that the control, not only of local but of general interests, was
divided amongst a thousand hands, and broken up in a thousand different
ways; the absence of a central [[government]] prevented the nations of
europe from advancing with energy in any straightforward course.

we have shown that in the [[united]] states no central administration and no
dependent series of [[public]] functionaries [[exist]]. local [[authority]] has been
carried to lengths which no [[european]] nation could endure without
great inconvenience, and which has even produced some disadvantageous
consequences in [[america]]. but in the [[united]] states the centralization
of the [[government]] is complete; and it would be easy to prove that the
national [[power]] is more compact than it has ever been in the old nations
of [[europe]]. not only is there but one legislative [[body]] in each [[state]];
not only does there [[exist]] but one source of [[political]] [[authority]];
but district assemblies and county courts have not in general been
multiplied, lest they should be tempted to exceed their administrative
duties, and interfere with the [[government]]. in [[america]] the legislature
of each [[state]] is supreme; nothing can impede its [[authority]]; neither
privileges, nor local immunities, nor personal influence, nor even the
empire of [[reason]], since it represents that majority which claims to be
the sole organ of [[reason]]. its own determination is, therefore, the only
limit to this action. in juxtaposition to it, and under its immediate
control, is the representative of the executive [[power]], whose [[duty]] it
is to constrain the refractory to submit by superior [[force]]. the only
symptom of weakness lies [[lie]] in [[certain]] details of the action of the
government. the american republics [[republic]] have no standing armies [[army]] to intimidate
a discontented minority; but as no minority has as yet been reduced to
declare open [[war]], the necessity of an [[army]] has not been [[felt]]. *q the
state usually employs the officers of the township or the county to
deal with the [[citizens]]. thus, for instance, in new [[england]], the assessor
fixes the rate of taxes; the collector receives them; the town-treasurer
transmits the amount to the [[public]] treasury; and the disputes which may
arise are brought before the ordinary courts of [[justice]]. this method of
collecting taxes is slow as well as inconvenient, and it would prove a
perpetual hindrance to a [[government]] whose pecuniary demands were large.
it is desirable that, in whatever materially affects its existence, the
government should be served by officers of its own, appointed by itself,
removable at [[pleasure]], and accustomed to rapid methods of proceeding.
but it will always be easy for the central [[government]], organized as it
is in [[america]], to introduce new and more efficacious modes of action,
proportioned to its wants. [footnote q: [the civil [[war]] of 1860-65
cruelly belied this statement, and in the course of the struggle the
north alone called two millions and a half of [[men]] to arms; but to the
honor of the [[united]] states it must be added that, with the cessation
of the contest, this [[army]] disappeared as rapidly as it had been
raised.--translator's note.]]

the absence of a central [[government]] will not, then, as has often been
asserted, prove the destruction of the republics [[republic]] of the new [[world]];
far from supposing that the american governments [[government]] are not sufficiently
centralized, i shall prove hereafter that they are too much so. the
legislative bodies [[body]] daily encroach upon the [[authority]] of the [[government]],
and their tendency, like that of the french convention, is to
appropriate it entirely to themselves. under these circumstances the
social [[power]] is constantly changing hands, because it is subordinate to
the [[power]] of the [[people]], which is too apt to forget the maxims [[maxim]] of wisdom
and of foresight in the [[consciousness]] of its [[strength]]: hence arises its
danger; and thus its vigor, and not its impotence, will probably be the
cause of its ultimate destruction.

the [[system]] of local administration produces [[produce]] several different effects in
america. the americans seem to me to have outstepped the limits of sound
policy in isolating the administration of the [[government]]; for order,
even in second-rate affairs, is a matter of national importance. *r as
the [[state]] has no administrative functionaries of its own, stationed on
different points of its territory, to whom it can give a [[common]] impulse,
the consequence is that it rarely attempts to issue any general police
regulations. the want of these regulations is severely [[felt]], and is
frequently observed by europeans [[european]]. the appearance of disorder which
prevails on the surface leads him at first to imagine that [[society]] is
in a [[state]] of [[anarchy]]; nor does he perceive his mistake till he has gone
deeper into the [[subject]]. [[certain]] undertakings are of importance to the
whole [[state]]; but they cannot be put in execution, because there is no
national administration to direct them. abandoned to the exertions of
the towns or counties, under the [[care]] of elected or temporary agents,
they lead to no result, or at least to no durable benefit.

[footnote r: the [[authority]] which represents the [[state]] ought not, i
think, to waive the [[right]] of inspecting the local administration, even
when it does not interfere more actively. suppose, for instance, that
an agent of the [[government]] was stationed at some appointed spot in the
country, to prosecute the misdemeanors of the town and county officers,
would not a more uniform order be the result, without in any way
compromising the independence of the township? nothing of the [[kind]],
however, exists in [[america]]: there is nothing above the county-courts,
which have, as it were, only an incidental cognizance of the offences
they are meant to repress.]

the partisans of centralization in [[europe]] are wont to maintain that the
government directs the affairs of each locality [[better]] than the citizens
could do it for themselves; this may be true when the central [[power]] is
enlightened, and when the local districts are ignorant; when it is as
alert as they are slow; when it is accustomed to act, and they to obey.
indeed, it is evident that this double tendency must augment with the
increase of centralization, and that the readiness of the one and the
incapacity of the others must become more and more prominent. but i deny
that such is the case when the [[people]] is as enlightened, as awake to its
interests, and as accustomed to reflect on them, as the americans are. i
am persuaded, on the contrary, that in this case the collective strength
of the [[citizens]] will always conduce more efficaciously to the public
welfare than the [[authority]] of the [[government]]. it is difficult to point
out with certainty the means of arousing a sleeping [[population]], and of
giving it [[passions]] and [[knowledge]] which it does not possess; it is, i
am well aware, an arduous task to persuade [[men]] to busy themselves about
their own affairs; and it would frequently be easier to interest them
in the punctilios of court etiquette than in the repairs of their common
dwelling. but whenever a central administration affects to supersede
the persons [[person]] most interested, i am inclined to suppose that it is either
misled or desirous to mislead. however enlightened and however skilful a
central [[power]] may be, it cannot of itself embrace all the details of the
existence of a [[great]] nation. such vigilance exceeds the powers [[power]] of [[man]].
and when it attempts to create and set in motion so many complicated
springs, it must submit to a very imperfect result, or consume itself in
bootless efforts.

centralization succeeds more easily, indeed, in subjecting the external
actions of [[men]] to a [[certain]] uniformity, which at least commands our
regard, independently of the objects to which it is applied, like those
devotees who [[worship]] the statue and forget the deity it represents.
centralization imparts without difficulty an admirable regularity to the
routine of [[business]]; provides for the details of the social police
with sagacity; represses the smallest disorder and the most petty
misdemeanors; maintains [[society]] in a status quo alike secure from
improvement and decline; and perpetuates a drowsy precision in the
conduct of affairs, which is hailed by the heads of the administration
as a sign of [[perfect]] order and [[public]] tranquillity: *s in short, it
excels more in prevention than in action. its [[force]] deserts it when
society is to be disturbed or accelerated in its course; and if once the
co-operation of private [[citizens]] is necessary to the furtherance of
its measures, the secret of its impotence is disclosed. even whilst it
invokes their assistance, it is on the condition that they shall act
exactly as much as the [[government]] chooses, and exactly in the manner it
appoints. they are to take charge of the details, without aspiring to
guide the [[system]]; they are to [[work]] in a dark and subordinate sphere, and
only to [[judge]] the acts in which they have themselves cooperated by their
results. these, however, are not conditions on which the [[alliance]] of
the [[human]] will is to be obtained; its carriage must be [[free]] and its
actions responsible, or (such is the [[constitution]] of man) the citizen
had rather remain a passive spectator than a dependent actor in schemes
with which he is unacquainted.

[footnote s: [[china]] appears to me to [[present]] the most [[perfect]] instance of
that [[species]] of well-being which a completely central administration may
furnish to the nations among which it exists. travellers assure us that
the chinese have [[peace]] without [[happiness]], industry without improvement,
stability without [[strength]], and [[public]] order without [[public]] morality.
the condition of [[society]] is always tolerable, never excellent. i am
convinced that, when [[china]] is opened to [[european]] observation, it will
be found to contain the most [[perfect]] model of a central administration
which exists in the [[universe]].]

it is undeniable that the want of those uniform regulations which
control the conduct of every inhabitant of [[france]] is not unfrequently
felt in the [[united]] states. gross instances of social indifference and
neglect are to be met with, and from [[time]] to [[time]] disgraceful blemishes
are seen in complete contrast with the surrounding [[civilization]]. useful
undertakings which cannot succeed without perpetual attention and
rigorous exactitude are very frequently abandoned in the end; for in
america, as well as in other countries [[country]], the [[people]] is [[subject]] to sudden
impulses and momentary exertions. the [[european]] who is accustomed to find
a functionary always at hand to interfere with all he undertakes has
some difficulty in accustoming himself to the complex mechanism of the
administration of the townships. in general it may be affirmed that the
lesser details of the [[police]], which render [[life]] easy and comfortable,
are neglected in [[america]]; but that the essential guarantees of [[man]] in
society are as [[strong]] there as elsewhere. in [[america]] the [[power]] which
conducts the [[government]] is far less regular, less enlightened, and less
learned, but an hundredfold more authoritative than in [[europe]]. in no
country in the [[world]] do the [[citizens]] make such exertions for the common
weal; and i am acquainted with no [[people]] which has established schools
as numerous and as efficacious, places of [[public]] [[worship]] [[better]] suited
to the wants of the inhabitants, or roads kept in [[better]] repair.
uniformity or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of details,
*t and the [[perfection]] of an ingenious administration, must not be sought
for in the [[united]] states; but it will be easy to find, on the other
hand, the symptoms of a [[power]] which, if it is somewhat barbarous, is
at least robust; and of an existence which is checkered with accidents
indeed, but cheered at the same [[time]] by animation and effort.

[footnote t: a writer of talent, who, in the comparison which he has
drawn between the finances of [[france]] and those of the [[united]] states, has
proved that ingenuity cannot always supply the place of a [[knowledge]] of
facts, very justly reproaches the americans for the sort of confusion
which exists in the accounts of the expenditure in the townships; and
after giving the model of a departmental budget in [[france]], he adds:--"we
are indebted to centralization, that admirable invention of a great
man, for the uniform order and method which prevail alike in all the
municipal budgets, from the largest town to the humblest commune."
whatever may be my admiration of this result, when i see the communes
of [[france]], with their excellent [[system]] of accounts, plunged into
the grossest ignorance of their true interests, and abandoned to so
incorrigible an apathy that they seem to vegetate rather than to [[live]];
when, on the other hand, i observe the activity, the information, and
the spirit of enterprise which keep [[society]] in perpetual labor, in those
american townships whose budgets are drawn up with small method and with
still less uniformity, i am struck by the spectacle; for to my [[mind]] the
end of a [[good]] [[government]] is to ensure the welfare of a [[people]], and not
to establish order and regularity in the midst of its misery and its
distress. i am therefore [[led]] to suppose that the [[prosperity]] of the
american townships and the apparent confusion of their accounts, the
distress of the french communes and the [[perfection]] of their budget,
may be attributable to the same cause. at any rate i am suspicious of a
benefit which is [[united]] to so many evils [[evil]], and i am not averse to an evil
which is compensated by so many benefits.]

granting for an instant that the villages and counties of the united
states would be more usefully governed by a remote [[authority]] which
they had never seen than by functionaries taken from the midst of
them--admitting, for the sake of argument, that the [[country]] would be
more secure, and the resources of [[society]] [[better]] employed, if the whole
administration centred in a [[single]] arm--still the [[political]] advantages
which the americans derive from their [[system]] would induce me to prefer
it to the contrary plan. it profits [[profit]] me but little, after all, that a
vigilant [[authority]] should [[protect]] the tranquillity of my pleasures
and constantly avert all dangers from my path, without my [[care]] or my
concern, if this same [[authority]] is the absolute mistress of my liberty
and of my [[life]], and if it so monopolizes all the energy of existence
that when it languishes everything languishes around it, that when it
sleeps everything must sleep, that when it dies the [[state]] itself must
perish.

in [[certain]] countries [[country]] of [[europe]] the natives consider themselves as a kind
of settlers, indifferent to the [[fate]] of the spot upon which they [[live]].
the [[greatest]] changes [[change]] are effected without their concurrence and (unless
chance may have apprised them of the event) without their [[knowledge]]; nay
more, the citizen is unconcerned as to the condition of his village, the
police of his street, the repairs of the [[church]] or of the parsonage; for
he looks upon all these things as unconnected with himself, and as the
property of a powerful stranger whom he calls the [[government]]. he has
only a life-interest in these possessions, and he entertains no notions
of ownership or of improvement. this want of interest in his own
affairs goes so far that, if his own safety or that of his [[children]] is
endangered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he will fold his arms,
and wait till the nation comes to his assistance. this same [[individual]],
who has so completely sacrificed his own [[free]] will, has no natural
propensity to [[obedience]]; he cowers, it is true, before the pettiest
officer; but he braves the [[law]] with the spirit of a conquered foe
as soon as its superior [[force]] is removed: his oscillations between
servitude and license are perpetual. when a nation has arrived at this
state it must either [[change]] its customs and its laws [[law]] or perish: the
source of [[public]] [[virtue]] is dry, and, though it may contain subjects [[subject]],
the [[race]] of [[citizens]] is extinct. such communities [[community]] are a [[natural]] prey to
foreign conquests, and if they do not disappear from the scene of [[life]],
it is because they are surrounded by other nations similar or inferior
to themselves: it is because the instinctive feeling of their country's
claims still exists in their hearts [[heart]]; and because an involuntary [[pride]] in
the name it bears, or a vague reminiscence of its bygone fame, suffices
to give them the impulse of self-preservation.

nor can the prodigious exertions made by tribes in the defence of a
country to which they did not belong be adduced in favor of such a
system; for it will be found that in these cases their main incitement
was [[religion]]. the permanence, the [[glory]], or the [[prosperity]] of the nation
were become parts of their [[faith]], and in defending the [[country]] they
inhabited they defended that holy [[city]] of which they were all [[citizens]].
the turkish tribes have never taken an active share in the conduct of
the affairs of [[society]], but they accomplished stupendous enterprises as
long as the victories [[victory]] of the sultan were the triumphs of the mohammedan
faith. in the [[present]] [[age]] they are in rapid decay, because their
religion is departing, and despotism only remains. montesquieu, who
attributed to absolute [[power]] an [[authority]] peculiar to itself, did it,
as i conceive, an undeserved [[honor]]; for despotism, taken by itself,
can [[produce]] no durable results. on close inspection we shall find
that [[religion]], and not [[fear]], has ever been the cause of the long-lived
prosperity of an absolute [[government]]. whatever exertions may be made, no
true [[power]] can be founded among [[men]] which does not depend upon the free
union of their inclinations; and [[patriotism]] and [[religion]] are the only
two motives in the [[world]] which can permanently direct the whole of a
body [[politic]] to one end.

laws cannot succeed in rekindling the ardor of an extinguished [[faith]],
but [[men]] may be interested in the [[fate]] of their [[country]] by the laws [[law]]. by
this influence the vague impulse of [[patriotism]], which never abandons the
human [[heart]], may be directed and revived; and if it be connected with
the thoughts [[thought]], the [[passions]], and the daily habits of [[life]], it may be
consolidated into a durable and [[rational]] sentiment.

let it not be said that the [[time]] for the experiment is already [[past]]; for
the old [[age]] of nations is not like the old [[age]] of [[men]], and every fresh
generation is a new [[people]] ready for the [[care]] of the legislator.

it is not the administrative but the [[political]] effects of the local
system that i most [[admire]] in [[america]]. in the [[united]] states the interests
of the [[country]] are everywhere kept in view; they are an object of
solicitude to the [[people]] of the whole union, and every citizen is as
warmly attached to them as if they were his own. he takes [[pride]] in the
glory of his nation; he boasts of its [[success]], to which he conceives
himself to have contributed, and he rejoices in the general prosperity
by which he profits [[profit]]. the feeling he entertains towards the [[state]] is
analogous to that which unites him to his [[family]], and it is by a [[kind]] of
egotism that he interests himself in the welfare of his [[country]].

the [[european]] generally submits to a [[public]] officer because he represents
a superior [[force]]; but to an american he represents a [[right]]. in america
it may be said that no one renders [[obedience]] to [[man]], but to justice
and to [[law]]. if the [[opinion]] which the citizen entertains of himself is
exaggerated, it is at least salutary; he unhesitatingly confides in his
own powers [[power]], which appear to him to be all-sufficient. when a private
individual meditates an undertaking, however directly connected it
may be with the welfare of [[society]], he never thinks [[think]] of soliciting the
co-operation of the [[government]], but he publishes his plan, offers to
execute it himself, courts the assistance of other individuals [[individual]], and
struggles manfully against all obstacles. undoubtedly he is often less
successful than the [[state]] might have been in his position; but in the
end the sum of these private undertakings far exceeds all that the
government could have done.

as the administrative [[authority]] is within the reach of the [[citizens]],
whom it in some [[degree]] represents, it excites neither their [[jealousy]] nor
their [[hatred]]; as its resources are limited, every one feels [[feel]] that he must
not rely solely on its assistance. thus, when the administration thinks
fit to interfere, it is not abandoned to itself as in [[europe]]; the duties
of the private [[citizens]] are not supposed to have lapsed because the
state assists in their fulfilment, but every one is ready, on the
contrary, to guide and to support it. this action of individual
exertions, joined to that of the [[public]] authorities [[authority]], frequently performs
what the most energetic central administration would be unable to
execute. it would be easy to adduce several facts [[fact]] in proof of what i
advance, but i had rather give only one, with which i am more thoroughly
acquainted. *u in [[america]] the means which the authorities [[authority]] have at their
disposal for the discovery of crimes and the arrest of criminals [[criminal]] are
few. the [[state]] [[police]] does not [[exist]], and passports are unknown. the
criminal [[police]] of the [[united]] states cannot be compared to that of
france; the magistrates and [[public]] prosecutors are not numerous, and the
examinations of prisoners [[prisoner]] are rapid and oral. nevertheless in no country
does crime more rarely elude [[punishment]]. the [[reason]] is, that every one
conceives himself to be interested in furnishing evidence of the act
committed, and in stopping the delinquent. during my stay in the united
states i witnessed the spontaneous formation of committees for the
pursuit and prosecution of a [[man]] who had committed a [[great]] crime in
a [[certain]] county. in [[europe]] a [[criminal]] is an unhappy being who is
struggling for his [[life]] against the ministers of [[justice]], whilst the
population is merely a spectator of the conflict; in [[america]] he is
looked upon as an [[enemy]] of the [[human]] [[race]], and the whole of [[mankind]] is
against him.

[footnote u: see appendix, i.]

i [[believe]] that provincial [[institutions]] are useful to all nations, but
nowhere do they appear to me to be more indispensable than amongst a
democratic [[people]]. in an [[aristocracy]] order can always be maintained in
the midst of [[liberty]], and as the rulers have a [[great]] deal to lose order
is to them a first-rate consideration. in like manner an aristocracy
protects the [[people]] from the excesses of despotism, because it always
possesses an organized [[power]] ready to resist a despot. but a democracy
without provincial [[institutions]] has no security against these evils [[evil]]. how
can a populace, unaccustomed to [[freedom]] in small concerns, learn to
use it temperately in [[great]] affairs? what [[resistance]] can be offered to
tyranny in a [[country]] where every private [[individual]] is impotent, and
where the [[citizens]] are [[united]] by no [[common]] tie? those who dread the
license of the mob, and those who [[fear]] the [[rule]] of absolute [[power]], ought
alike to [[desire]] the progressive [[growth]] of provincial liberties [[liberty]].

on the other hand, i am convinced that democratic nations are most
exposed to fall beneath the yoke of a central administration, for
several reasons [[reason]], amongst which is the following. the constant tendency
of these nations is to concentrate all the [[strength]] of the government
in the hands of the only [[power]] which directly represents the [[people]],
because beyond the [[people]] nothing is to be perceived but a mass of equal
individuals confounded together. but when the same [[power]] is already
in possession of all the attributes of the [[government]], it can scarcely
refrain from penetrating into the details of the administration, and an
opportunity of doing so is sure to [[present]] itself in the end, as was
the case in [[france]]. in the french [[revolution]] there were two impulses
in opposite directions, which must never be confounded--the one was
favorable to [[liberty]], the other to despotism. under the ancient monarchy
the [[king]] was the sole author of the laws [[law]], and below the [[power]] of the
sovereign [[certain]] vestiges of provincial [[institutions]], half destroyed,
were still distinguishable. these provincial [[institutions]] were
incoherent, ill compacted, and frequently absurd; in the hands of
the [[aristocracy]] they had sometimes been converted into instruments of
oppression. the [[revolution]] declared itself the [[enemy]] of royalty and of
provincial [[institutions]] at the same [[time]]; it confounded all that
had preceded it--despotic [[power]] and the checks to its abuses--in
indiscriminate [[hatred]], and its tendency was at once to overthrow and
to centralize. this double [[character]] of the french [[revolution]] is a fact
which has been adroitly handled by the [[friends]] of absolute [[power]]. can
they be accused of laboring in the cause of despotism when they are
defending that central administration which was one of the great
innovations of the [[revolution]]? *v in this manner popularity may be
conciliated with hostility to the rights [[right]] of the [[people]], and the secret
slave of [[tyranny]] may be the professed admirer of [[freedom]].

[footnote v: see appendix k.]

i have visited the two nations in which the [[system]] of provincial liberty
has been most perfectly established, and i have listened to the opinions
of different parties in those countries [[country]]. in [[america]] i met with [[men]] who
secretly aspired to [[destroy]] the democratic [[institutions]] of the union; in
england i found others who attacked the [[aristocracy]] openly, but i
know of no one who does not regard provincial independence as a great
benefit. in both countries [[country]] i have heard a thousand different causes
assigned for the evils [[evil]] of the [[state]], but the local [[system]] was never
mentioned amongst them. i have heard [[citizens]] attribute the [[power]] and
prosperity of their [[country]] to a multitude of reasons [[reason]], but they all
placed the advantages of local [[institutions]] in the foremost rank. am
i to suppose that when [[men]] who are naturally so divided on religious
opinions and on [[political]] theories agree on one point (and that one
of which they have daily experience), they are all in error? the only
nations which deny the utility of provincial liberties [[liberty]] are those which
have fewest of them; in other words, those who are unacquainted with the
institution are the only persons [[person]] who pass a censure upon it.




chapter vi: judicial [[power]] in the [[united]] states

chapter summary

the anglo-americans have retained the characteristics of judicial power
which are [[common]] to all nations--they have, however, made it a powerful
political organ--how--in what the judicial [[system]] of the anglo-americans
differs from that of all other nations--why the american judges [[judge]] have the
right of declaring the laws [[law]] to be unconstitutional--how they use this
right--precautions taken by the legislator to prevent its [[abuse]].

judicial [[power]] in the [[united]] states and its influence on political
society.

i have [[thought]] it essential to devote a separate [[chapter]] to the judicial
authorities of the [[united]] states, lest their [[great]] [[political]] importance
should be lessened in the reader's [[eyes]] by a merely incidental mention
of them. confederations have existed in other countries [[country]] beside [[america]],
and republics [[republic]] have not been established upon the shores of the new
world alone; the representative [[system]] of [[government]] has been adopted
in several states of [[europe]], but i am not aware that any nation of
the globe has hitherto organized a judicial [[power]] on the [[principle]] now
adopted by the americans. the judicial organization of the [[united]] states
is the institution which a stranger has the [[greatest]] difficulty
in understanding. he hears the [[authority]] of a [[judge]] invoked in the
political occurrences of every day, and he naturally concludes that
in the [[united]] states the judges [[judge]] are important [[political]] functionaries;
nevertheless, when he examines the [[nature]] of the tribunals, they offer
nothing which is contrary to the usual habits and privileges [[privilege]] of those
bodies, and the magistrates seem to him to interfere in [[public]] affairs
of [[chance]], but by a [[chance]] which recurs every day.

when the [[parliament]] of [[paris]] remonstrated, or refused to enregister an
edict, or when it summoned a functionary accused of malversation to its
bar, its [[political]] influence as a judicial [[body]] was clearly visible; but
nothing of the [[kind]] is to be seen in the [[united]] states. the americans
have retained all the ordinary characteristics of judicial [[authority]],
and have carefully restricted its action to the ordinary circle of its
functions.

the first characteristic of judicial [[power]] in all nations is the duty
of arbitration. but rights [[right]] must be contested in order to warrant the
interference of a tribunal; and an action must be brought to obtain the
decision of a [[judge]]. as long, therefore, as the [[law]] is uncontested, the
judicial [[authority]] is not called upon to discuss it, and it may exist
without being perceived. when a [[judge]] in a given case attacks a law
relating to that case, he extends the circle of his customary duties [[duty]],
without however stepping beyond it; since he is in some measure obliged
to decide upon the [[law]] in order to decide the case. but if he pronounces
upon a [[law]] without resting upon a case, he clearly steps beyond his
sphere, and invades that of the legislative [[authority]].

the second characteristic of judicial [[power]] is that it pronounces on
special cases, and not upon general principles [[principle]]. if a [[judge]] in deciding
a particular point destroys a general [[principle]], by passing a judgment
which tends to reject all the inferences from that [[principle]], and
consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his
functions. but if he directly attacks a general [[principle]] without having
a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations
have agreed to confine his [[authority]], he assumes a more important, and
perhaps a more useful, influence than that of the magistrate, but he
ceases to be a representative of the judicial [[power]].


the third characteristic of the judicial [[power]] is its inability to act
unless it is appealed to, or until it has taken cognizance of an
affair. this characteristic is less general than the other two; but,
notwithstanding the exceptions, i [[think]] it may be regarded as essential.
the judicial [[power]] is by its [[nature]] devoid of action; it must be put in
motion in order to [[produce]] a result. when it is called upon to repress a
crime, it punishes the [[criminal]]; when a [[wrong]] is to be redressed, it is
ready to redress it; when an act requires interpretation, it is prepared
to interpret it; but it does not pursue criminals [[criminal]], hunt out wrongs [[wrong]],
or examine into evidence of its own accord. a judicial functionary who
should open proceedings, and usurp the censorship of the laws [[law]], would in
some measure do [[violence]] to the passive [[nature]] of his [[authority]].

the americans have retained these three distinguishing characteristics
of the judicial [[power]]; an american [[judge]] can only pronounce a decision
when litigation has arisen, he is only conversant with special cases,
and he cannot act until the cause has been duly brought before the
court. his position is therefore perfectly similar to that of the
magistrate of other nations; and he is nevertheless invested with
immense [[political]] [[power]]. if the sphere of his [[authority]] and his means of
action are the same as those of other judges [[judge]], it may be [[asked]] whence he
derives a [[power]] which they do not possess. the cause of this difference
lies in the simple [[fact]] that the americans have acknowledged the right
of the judges [[judge]] to found their decisions on the [[constitution]] rather than
on the laws [[law]]. in other words, they have left them at [[liberty]] not to apply
such laws [[law]] as may appear to them to be unconstitutional.

i am aware that a similar [[right]] has been claimed--but claimed in
vain--by courts of [[justice]] in other countries [[country]]; but in [[america]] it is
recognized by all authorities [[authority]]; and not a party, nor so much as an
individual, is found to contest it. this [[fact]] can only be explained by
the principles [[principle]] of the american [[constitution]]. in [[france]] the constitution
is (or at least is supposed to be) immutable; and the received theory is
that no [[power]] has the [[right]] of changing any part of it. in [[england]] the
parliament has an acknowledged [[right]] to modify the [[constitution]]; as,
therefore, the [[constitution]] may undergo perpetual changes [[change]], it does
not in reality [[exist]]; the [[parliament]] is at once a legislative and a
constituent assembly. the [[political]] theories of [[america]] are more simple
and more [[rational]]. an american [[constitution]] is not supposed to be
immutable as in [[france]], nor is it susceptible of modification by the
ordinary powers [[power]] of [[society]] as in [[england]]. it constitutes a detached
whole, which, as it represents the determination of the whole [[people]], is
no less binding on the legislator than on the private citizen, but
which may be altered by the will of the [[people]] in predetermined
cases, according to established rules [[rule]]. in [[america]] the constitution
may therefore vary, but as long as it exists it is the origin of all
authority, and the sole vehicle of the predominating [[force]]. *a

[footnote a: [the fifth article of the original [[constitution]] of the
united states provides the mode in which amendments of the constitution
may be made. amendments must be proposed by two-thirds of both houses
of congress, and ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the
several states. fifteen amendments of the [[constitution]] have been made
at different times [[time]] since 1789, the most important of which are the
thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth, framed and ratified after the
civil [[war]]. the original [[constitution]] of the [[united]] states, followed
by these fifteen amendments, is printed at the end of this edition.
--translator's note, 1874.]]

it is easy to perceive in what manner these differences must act
upon the position and the rights [[right]] of the judicial bodies [[body]] in the three
countries i have cited. if in [[france]] the tribunals were authorized
to disobey the laws [[law]] on the ground of their being opposed to the
constitution, the supreme [[power]] would in [[fact]] be placed in their hands,
since they alone would have the [[right]] of interpreting a [[constitution]],
the clauses of which can be modified by no [[authority]]. they would
therefore take the place of the nation, and exercise as absolute a sway
over [[society]] as the inherent weakness of judicial [[power]] would allow them
to do. undoubtedly, as the french judges [[judge]] are incompetent to declare a
law to be unconstitutional, the [[power]] of changing the [[constitution]] is
indirectly given to the legislative [[body]], since no legal barrier would
oppose the alterations which it might prescribe. but it is [[better]] to
grant the [[power]] of changing the [[constitution]] of the [[people]] to [[men]] who
represent (however imperfectly) the will of the [[people]], than to [[men]] who
represent no one but themselves.

it would be still more unreasonable to invest the english judges [[judge]] with
the [[right]] of resisting the decisions of the legislative [[body]], since
the [[parliament]] which makes the laws [[law]] also makes the [[constitution]]; and
consequently a [[law]] emanating from the three powers [[power]] of the [[state]] can in
no case be unconstitutional. but neither of these remarks is applicable
to [[america]].

in the [[united]] states the [[constitution]] governs the legislator as much as
the private citizen; as it is the first of laws [[law]] it cannot be modified
by a [[law]], and it is therefore just that the tribunals should obey the
constitution in preference to any [[law]]. this condition is essential to
the [[power]] of the judicature, for to select that legal obligation
by which he is most strictly bound is the [[natural]] [[right]] of every
magistrate.

in [[france]] the [[constitution]] is also the first of laws [[law]], and the judges
have the same [[right]] to take it as the ground of their decisions, but
were they to exercise this [[right]] they must perforce encroach on rights
more [[sacred]] than their own, namely, on those of [[society]], in whose name
they are acting. in this case the state-motive clearly prevails over the
motives of an [[individual]]. in [[america]], where the nation can always reduce
its magistrates to [[obedience]] by changing its [[constitution]], no danger of
this [[kind]] is to be feared. upon this point, therefore, the [[political]] and
the logical reasons [[reason]] agree, and the [[people]] as well as the judges [[judge]] preserve
their privileges [[privilege]].

whenever a [[law]] which the [[judge]] holds to be unconstitutional is argued
in a tribunal of the [[united]] states he may refuse to admit it as a [[rule]];
this [[power]] is the only one which is peculiar to the american magistrate,
but it gives rise to immense [[political]] influence. few laws [[law]] can escape
the searching analysis of the judicial [[power]] for any length of [[time]],
for there are few which are not prejudicial to some private interest or
other, and none which may not be brought before a court of [[justice]] by
the [[choice]] of parties, or by the necessity of the case. but from the
time that a [[judge]] has refused to apply any given [[law]] in a case, that law
loses a portion of its [[moral]] cogency. the persons [[person]] to whose interests
it is prejudicial learn that means [[exist]] of evading its [[authority]], and
similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. one of
two alternatives must then be resorted to: the [[people]] must alter the
constitution, or the legislature must repeal the [[law]]. the political
power which the americans have intrusted to their courts of justice
is therefore immense, but the evils [[evil]] of this [[power]] are considerably
diminished by the obligation which has been imposed of attacking
the laws [[law]] through the courts of [[justice]] alone. if the [[judge]] had been
empowered to contest the laws [[law]] on the ground of theoretical generalities,
if he had been enabled to open an attack or to pass a censure on the
legislator, he would have played a prominent part in the political
sphere; and as the champion or the antagonist of a party, he would have
arrayed the hostile [[passions]] of the nation in the conflict. but when
a [[judge]] contests a [[law]] applied to some particular case in an obscure
proceeding, the importance of his attack is concealed from the public
gaze, his decision bears upon the interest of an [[individual]], and if
the [[law]] is slighted it is only collaterally. moreover, although it is
censured, it is not abolished; its [[moral]] [[force]] may be diminished, but
its cogency is by no means suspended, and its final destruction can only
be accomplished by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries. it
will readily be understood that by connecting the censorship of the
laws with the private interests of members of the [[community]], and by
intimately uniting the prosecution of the [[law]] with the prosecution of
an [[individual]], legislation is protected from wanton assailants, and from
the daily aggressions of party spirit. the errors of the legislator are
exposed whenever their [[evil]] consequences are most [[felt]], and it is
always a positive and appreciable [[fact]] which serves as the basis of a
prosecution.

i am inclined to [[believe]] this practice of the american courts to be at
once the most favorable to [[liberty]] as well as to [[public]] order. if the
judge could only attack the legislator openly and directly, he would
sometimes be afraid to oppose any [[resistance]] to his will; and at other
moments party spirit might encourage him to brave it at every turn.
the laws [[law]] would consequently be attacked when the [[power]] from which they
emanate is [[weak]], and obeyed when it is [[strong]]. that is to say, when it
would be useful to [[respect]] them they would be contested, and when it
would be easy to convert them into an instrument of oppression they
would be respected. but the american [[judge]] is brought into the political
arena independently of his own will. he only judges [[judge]] the [[law]] because he
is obliged to [[judge]] a case. the [[political]] [[question]] which he is called
upon to resolve is connected with the interest of the suitors, and he
cannot refuse to decide it without abdicating the duties [[duty]] of his post.
he performs his functions as a citizen by fulfilling the precise duties
which belong to his profession as a magistrate. it is true that upon
this [[system]] the judicial censorship which is exercised by the courts of
justice over the legislation cannot extend to all laws [[law]] indiscriminately,
inasmuch as some of them can never give rise to that exact species
of contestation which is termed a lawsuit; and even when such a
contestation is possible, it may happen that no one cares [[care]] to bring
it before a court of [[justice]]. the americans have often [[felt]] this
disadvantage, but they have left the remedy incomplete, lest they should
give it an efficacy which might in some cases prove dangerous. within
these limits the [[power]] vested in the american courts of [[justice]] of
pronouncing a statute to be unconstitutional forms one of the most
powerful barriers which has ever been devised against the [[tyranny]] of
political assemblies.

other powers [[power]] granted to american judges

the [[united]] states all the [[citizens]] have the [[right]] of indicting
public functionaries before the ordinary tribunals--how they use this
right--art. 75 of the french [[constitution]] of the an viii--the americans
and the english cannot [[understand]] the purport of this clause.

it is perfectly [[natural]] that in a [[free]] [[country]] like [[america]] all the
citizens should have the [[right]] of indicting [[public]] functionaries before
the ordinary tribunals, and that all the judges [[judge]] should have the [[power]] of
punishing [[public]] offences. the [[right]] granted to the courts of [[justice]] of
judging the agents of the executive [[government]], when they have violated
the laws [[law]], is so [[natural]] a one that it cannot be looked upon as an
extraordinary [[privilege]]. nor do the springs of [[government]] appear to
me to be weakened in the [[united]] states by the custom which renders all
public officers responsible to the judges [[judge]] of the [[land]]. the americans
seem, on the contrary, to have increased by this means that respect
which is due to the authorities [[authority]], and at the same [[time]] to have rendered
those who are in [[power]] more scrupulous of offending [[public]] [[opinion]]. i
was struck by the small number of [[political]] trials which occur in
the [[united]] states, but i had no difficulty in accounting for this
circumstance. a lawsuit, of whatever [[nature]] it may be, is always a
difficult and expensive undertaking. it is easy to attack a [[public]] man
in a journal, but the motives which can warrant an action at [[law]] must be
serious. a solid ground of complaint must therefore [[exist]] to induce
an [[individual]] to prosecute a [[public]] officer, and [[public]] officers are
careful not to furnish these grounds of complaint when they are afraid
of being prosecuted.

this does not depend upon the republican form of american [[institutions]],
for the same facts [[fact]] [[present]] themselves in [[england]]. these two nations
do not regard the impeachment of the principal officers of [[state]] as a
sufficient guarantee of their independence. but they hold that the
right of minor prosecutions, which are within the reach of the whole
community, is a [[better]] pledge of [[freedom]] than those [[great]] judicial
actions which are rarely employed until it is too late.

in the middle ages [[age]], when it was very difficult to overtake offenders,
the judges [[judge]] inflicted the most dreadful tortures on the few who were
arrested, which by no means diminished the number of crimes. it has
since been discovered that when [[justice]] is more [[certain]] and more mild,
it is at the same [[time]] more efficacious. the english and the americans
hold that [[tyranny]] and oppression are to be treated like any other crime,
by lessening the penalty and facilitating conviction.

in the year viii of the french [[republic]] a [[constitution]] was drawn up in
which the following clause was introduced: "art. 75. all the agents of
the [[government]] below the rank of ministers can only be prosecuted for
offences relating to their several functions by [[virtue]] of a decree of
the conseil d'etat; in which the case the prosecution takes place before
the ordinary tribunals." this clause survived the "constitution de l'an
viii," and it is still maintained in spite of the just complaints of
the nation. i have always found the utmost difficulty in explaining its
meaning to englishmen or americans. they were at once [[led]] to conclude
that the conseil d'etat in [[france]] was a [[great]] tribunal, established in
the centre of the [[kingdom]], which exercised a preliminary and somewhat
tyrannical jurisdiction in all [[political]] causes. but when i told them
that the conseil d'etat was not a judicial [[body]], in the [[common]] sense of
the term, but an administrative council composed of [[men]] dependent on
the [[crown]], so that the [[king]], after having ordered one of his servants,
called a prefect, to commit an [[injustice]], has the [[power]] of commanding
another of his servants, called a councillor of [[state]], to prevent the
former from being punished; when i demonstrated to them that the citizen
who has been injured by the order of the [[sovereign]] is obliged to solicit
from the [[sovereign]] permission to obtain redress, they refused to credit
so flagrant an [[abuse]], and were tempted to accuse me of falsehood or
of ignorance. it frequently happened before the [[revolution]] that a
parliament issued a warrant against a [[public]] officer who had committed
an offence, and sometimes the proceedings were stopped by the authority
of the [[crown]], which enforced compliance with its absolute and despotic
will. it is painful to perceive how much lower we are sunk than our
forefathers, since we allow things to pass under the color of justice
and the sanction of the [[law]] which [[violence]] alone could impose upon them.




chapter vii: [[political]] jurisdiction in the [[united]] states

chapter summary

definition of [[political]] jurisdiction--what is understood by political
jurisdiction in [[france]], in [[england]], and in the [[united]] states--in america
the [[political]] [[judge]] can only pass sentence on [[public]] officers--he
more frequently passes a sentence of removal from office than a
penalty--political jurisdiction as it exists in the [[united]] states
is, notwithstanding its mildness, and perhaps in consequence of that
mildness, a most powerful instrument in the hands of the majority.

political jurisdiction in the [[united]] states

i [[understand]], by [[political]] jurisdiction, that temporary [[right]] of
pronouncing a legal decision with which a [[political]] [[body]] may be
invested.

in absolute governments [[government]] no utility can accrue from the introduction of
extraordinary forms of procedure; the [[prince]] in whose name an offender
is prosecuted is as much the [[sovereign]] of the courts of [[justice]] as of
everything else, and the [[idea]] which is entertained of his [[power]] is of
itself a sufficient security. the only thing he has to [[fear]] is, that
the external formalities of [[justice]] should be neglected, and that his
authority should be dishonored from a [[wish]] to render it more absolute.
but in most [[free]] countries [[country]], in which the majority can never exercise the
same influence upon the tribunals as an absolute monarch, the judicial
power has occasionally been vested for a [[time]] in the representatives
of the nation. it has been [[thought]] [[better]] to introduce a temporary
confusion between the functions of the different authorities [[authority]] than to
violate the necessary [[principle]] of the unity of [[government]].

england, [[france]], and the [[united]] states have established this political
jurisdiction by [[law]]; and it is [[curious]] to examine the different
adaptations which these three [[great]] nations have made of the [[principle]].
in [[england]] and in [[france]] the house of lords [[lord]] and the chambre des [[paris]] *a
constitute the highest [[criminal]] court of their respective nations, and
although they do not habitually try all [[political]] offences, they are
competent to try them all. another [[political]] [[body]] enjoys the [[right]] of
impeachment before the house of lords [[lord]]: the only difference which exists
between the two countries [[country]] in this [[respect]] is, that in [[england]] the
commons may impeach whomsoever they please before the lords [[lord]], whilst in
france the deputies can only employ this mode of prosecution against the
ministers of the [[crown]].

[footnote a: [as it existed under the constitutional [[monarchy]] down to
1848.]]

in both countries [[country]] the upper house may make use of all the existing penal
laws of the nation to punish the delinquents.

in the [[united]] states, as well as in [[europe]], one branch of the
legislature is authorized to impeach and another to [[judge]]: the house
of representatives arraigns the offender, and the senate awards his
sentence. but the senate can only try such persons [[person]] as are brought before
it by the house of representatives, and those persons [[person]] must belong to the
class of [[public]] functionaries. thus the jurisdiction of the senate is
less extensive than that of the peers of [[france]], whilst the [[right]] of
impeachment by the representatives is more general than that of the
deputies. but the [[great]] difference which exists between [[europe]] and
america is, that in [[europe]] [[political]] tribunals are empowered to inflict
all the dispositions of the penal code, while in [[america]], when they
have deprived the offender of his official rank, and have declared
him incapable of filling any [[political]] office for the future, their
jurisdiction terminates and that of the ordinary tribunals begins.

suppose, for instance, that the president of the [[united]] states has
committed the crime of high [[treason]]; the house of representatives
impeaches him, and the senate degrades him; he must then be tried by
a jury, which alone can deprive him of his [[liberty]] or his [[life]]. this
accurately illustrates the [[subject]] we are treating. the political
jurisdiction which is established by the laws [[law]] of [[europe]] is intended to
try [[great]] offenders, whatever may be their birth, their rank, or their
powers in the [[state]]; and to this end all the privileges [[privilege]] of the courts
of [[justice]] are temporarily extended to a [[great]] [[political]] assembly. the
legislator is then transformed into the magistrate; he is called upon
to admit, to distinguish, and to punish the offence; and as he exercises
all the [[authority]] of a [[judge]], the [[law]] restricts him to the observance
of all the duties [[duty]] of that high office, and of all the formalities of
justice. when a [[public]] functionary is impeached before an english or a
french [[political]] tribunal, and is found guilty, the sentence deprives
him ipso facto of his functions, and it may pronounce him to be
incapable of resuming them or any others for the future. but in this
case the [[political]] interdict is a consequence of the sentence, and not
the sentence itself. in [[europe]] the sentence of a [[political]] tribunal is
to be regarded as a judicial verdict rather than as an administrative
measure. in the [[united]] states the contrary takes place; and although the
decision of the senate is judicial in its form, since the senators
are obliged to comply with the practices and formalities of a court of
justice; although it is judicial in [[respect]] to the motives on which it
is founded, since the senate is in general obliged to take an offence at
common [[law]] as the basis of its sentence; nevertheless the object of the
proceeding is purely administrative. if it had been the intention of
the american legislator to invest a [[political]] [[body]] with [[great]] judicial
authority, its action would not have been limited to the circle of
public functionaries, since the most dangerous enemies [[enemy]] of the [[state]] may
be in the possession of no functions at all; and this is especially true
in republics [[republic]], where party influence is the first of authorities [[authority]], and
where the [[strength]] of many a reader is increased by his exercising no
legal [[power]].

if it had been the intention of the american legislator to give
society the means of repressing [[state]] offences by exemplary [[punishment]],
according to the practice of ordinary [[justice]], the resources of the
penal code would all have been placed at the disposal of the political
tribunals. but the weapon with which they are intrusted is an imperfect
one, and it can never reach the most dangerous offenders, since [[men]] who
aim at the entire subversion of the laws [[law]] are not likely to murmur at a
political interdict.

the main object of the [[political]] jurisdiction which obtains in the
united states is, therefore, to deprive the ill-disposed citizen of
an [[authority]] which he has used amiss, and to prevent him from ever
acquiring it again. this is evidently an administrative measure
sanctioned by the formalities of a judicial decision. in this matter
the americans have created a mixed [[system]]; they have surrounded the act
which removes a [[public]] functionary with the securities of a political
trial; and they have deprived all [[political]] condemnations of their
severest penalties. every link of the [[system]] may easily be traced from
this point; we at once perceive why the american constitutions [[constitution]] subject
all the civil functionaries to the jurisdiction of the senate, whilst
the [[military]], whose crimes are nevertheless more formidable, are
exempted from that tribunal. in the civil service none of the american
functionaries can be said to be removable; the places which some of
them occupy are inalienable, and the others are chosen for a term which
cannot be shortened. it is therefore necessary to try them all in order
to deprive them of their [[authority]]. but [[military]] officers are
dependent on the [[chief]] magistrate of the [[state]], who is himself a civil
functionary, and the decision which condemns him is a blow upon them
all.

if we now compare the american and the [[european]] systems [[system]], we shall meet
with differences no less striking in the different effects which each of
them produces [[produce]] or may [[produce]]. in [[france]] and in [[england]] the jurisdiction
of [[political]] bodies [[body]] is looked upon as an extraordinary resource, which
is only to be employed in order to rescue [[society]] from unwonted dangers.
it is not to be denied that these tribunals, as they are constituted in
europe, are apt to violate the conservative [[principle]] of the balance of
power in the [[state]], and to threaten incessantly the lives [[life]] and liberties
of the [[subject]]. the same [[political]] jurisdiction in the [[united]] states is
only indirectly hostile to the balance of [[power]]; it cannot menace the
lives of the [[citizens]], and it does not hover, as in [[europe]], over the
heads of the [[community]], since those only who have submitted to its
authority on accepting office are exposed to the severity of its
investigations. it is at the same [[time]] less formidable and less
efficacious; indeed, it has not been considered by the legislators of
the [[united]] states as a remedy for the more [[violent]] evils [[evil]] of [[society]], but
as an ordinary means of conducting the [[government]]. in this [[respect]] it
probably exercises more real influence on the social [[body]] in america
than in [[europe]]. we must not be misled by the apparent mildness of the
american legislation in all that relates to [[political]] jurisdiction. it
is to be observed, in the first place, that in the [[united]] states the
tribunal which passes sentence is composed of the same elements,
and [[subject]] to the same influences, as the [[body]] which impeaches the
offender, and that this uniformity gives an almost irresistible impulse
to the vindictive [[passions]] of parties. if [[political]] judges [[judge]] in the united
states cannot inflict such heavy penalties as those of [[europe]], there is
the less [[chance]] of their acquitting a [[prisoner]]; and the conviction,
if it is less formidable, is more [[certain]]. the principal object of the
political tribunals of [[europe]] is to punish the offender; the purpose
of those in [[america]] is to deprive him of his [[authority]]. a political
condemnation in the [[united]] states may, therefore, be looked upon as a
preventive measure; and there is no [[reason]] for restricting the judges [[judge]] to
the exact definitions of [[criminal]] [[law]]. nothing can be more alarming than
the excessive latitude with which [[political]] offences are described in
the laws [[law]] of [[america]]. article ii., section 4, of the [[constitution]] of the
united states runs thus:--"the president, vice-president, and all
civil officers of the [[united]] states shall be removed from office on
impeachment for, and conviction of, [[treason]], bribery, or other high
crimes and misdemeanors." many of the constitutions [[constitution]] of the states
are even less explicit. "public officers," says the constitution
of massachusetts, *b "shall be impeached for misconduct or
maladministration;" the [[constitution]] of virginia declares that all
the civil officers who shall have offended against the [[state]], by
maladministration, [[corruption]], or other high crimes, may be impeached by
the house of delegates; in some constitutions [[constitution]] no offences are
specified, in order to [[subject]] the [[public]] functionaries to an unlimited
responsibility. *c but i will venture to affirm that it is precisely
their mildness which renders the american laws [[law]] most formidable in this
respect. we have shown that in [[europe]] the removal of a functionary and
his [[political]] interdiction are the consequences of the penalty he is
to undergo, and that in [[america]] they constitute the penalty itself.
the consequence is that in [[europe]] [[political]] tribunals are invested with
rights which they are afraid to use, and that the [[fear]] of punishing too
much hinders them from punishing at all. but in [[america]] no one hesitates
to inflict a penalty from which [[humanity]] does not recoil. to condemn a
political opponent to [[death]], in order to deprive him of his [[power]], is
to commit what all the [[world]] would execrate as a horrible assassination;
but to declare that opponent unworthy to exercise that [[authority]], to
deprive him of it, and to leave him uninjured in [[life]] and limb, may be
judged to be the [[fair]] issue of the struggle. but this sentence, which it
is so easy to pronounce, is not the less fatally severe to the majority
of those upon whom it is inflicted. [[great]] criminals [[criminal]] may undoubtedly
brave its intangible rigor, but ordinary offenders will dread it as a
condemnation which destroys their position in the [[world]], casts a blight
upon their [[honor]], and condemns them to a shameful inactivity worse than
death. the influence exercised in the [[united]] states upon the progress
of [[society]] by the jurisdiction of [[political]] bodies [[body]] may not appear to be
formidable, but it is only the more immense. it does not directly coerce
the [[subject]], but it renders the majority more absolute over those in
power; it does not confer an unbounded [[authority]] on the legislator which
can be exerted at some momentous crisis, but it establishes a temperate
and regular influence, which is at all times [[time]] available. if the [[power]] is
decreased, it can, on the other hand, be more conveniently employed and
more easily abused. by preventing [[political]] tribunals from inflicting
judicial punishments [[punishment]] the americans seem to have eluded the worst
consequences of legislative [[tyranny]], rather than [[tyranny]] itself; and
i am not sure that [[political]] jurisdiction, as it is constituted in the
united states, is not the most formidable weapon which has ever been
placed in the rude grasp of a popular majority. when the american
republics begin to degenerate it will be easy to verify the truth
of this observation, by remarking whether the number of political
impeachments augments.*d

chapter viii: the federal constitution--part i

i have hitherto considered each [[state]] as a separate whole, and i have
explained the different springs which the [[people]] sets in motion, and the
different means of action which it employs. but all the states which i
have considered as independent are forced to submit, in [[certain]] cases,
to the supreme [[authority]] of the union. the [[time]] is now come for me to
examine separately the [[supremacy]] with which the union has been invested,
and to cast a rapid glance over the federal [[constitution]].

chapter summary

origin of the first union--its weakness--congress appeals to the
constituent authority--interval of two years between this appeal and the
promulgation of the new [[constitution]].

history of the federal constitution


the thirteen colonies which simultaneously threw off the yoke of
england towards the end of the [[last]] century professed, as i have already
observed, the same [[religion]], the same [[language]], the same customs, and
almost the same laws [[law]]; they were struggling against a [[common]] [[enemy]]; and
these reasons [[reason]] were sufficiently [[strong]] to unite them one to another, and
to consolidate them into one nation. but as each of them had enjoyed a
separate existence and a [[government]] within its own control, the peculiar
interests and customs which resulted from this [[system]] were opposed to
a compact and intimate union which would have absorbed the individual
importance of each in the general importance of all. hence arose two
opposite tendencies, the one prompting the anglo-americans to unite,
the other to divide their [[strength]]. as long as the [[war]] with the
mother-country lasted the [[principle]] of union was kept alive by
necessity; and although the laws [[law]] which constituted it were defective,
the [[common]] tie subsisted in spite of their imperfections. *a but no
sooner was [[peace]] concluded than the faults [[fault]] of the legislation became
manifest, and the [[state]] seemed to be suddenly dissolved. each colony
became an independent [[republic]], and assumed an absolute sovereignty. the
federal [[government]], condemned to impotence by its [[constitution]], and
no longer sustained by the presence of a [[common]] danger, witnessed the
outrages offered to its flag by the [[great]] nations of [[europe]], whilst it
was scarcely able to maintain its ground against the [[indian]] tribes, and
to [[pay]] the interest of the debt which had been contracted during the
war of independence. it was already on the verge of destruction, when
it officially proclaimed its inability to conduct the [[government]], and
appealed to the constituent [[authority]] of the nation. *b if [[america]] ever
approached (for however brief a time) that lofty pinnacle of glory
to which the fancy of its inhabitants is wont to point, it was at the
solemn moment at which the [[power]] of the nation abdicated, as it were,
the [[empire]] of the [[land]]. all ages [[age]] have furnished the spectacle of a
people struggling with energy to [[win]] its independence; and the efforts
of the americans in throwing off the english yoke have been considerably
exaggerated. separated from their enemies [[enemy]] by three thousand miles of
ocean, and backed by a powerful ally, the [[success]] of the [[united]] states
may be more justly attributed to their geographical position than to the
valor of their armies [[army]] or the [[patriotism]] of their [[citizens]]. it would
be ridiculous to compare the american was to the wars [[war]] of the french
revolution, or the efforts of the americans to those of the french when
they were attacked by the whole of [[europe]], without credit and without
allies, yet capable of opposing a twentieth part of their [[population]] to
the [[world]], and of bearing the torch of [[revolution]] beyond their frontiers
whilst they stifled its devouring flame within the bosom of their
country. but it is a novelty in the [[history]] of [[society]] to see a great
people turn a calm and scrutinizing eye upon itself, when apprised by
the legislature that the wheels of [[government]] are stopped; to see it
carefully examine the extent of the [[evil]], and patiently wait for two
whole years until a remedy was discovered, which it voluntarily adopted
without having wrung a tear or a drop of [[blood]] from [[mankind]]. at the time
when the inadequacy of the first [[constitution]] was discovered america
possessed the double advantage of that calm which had succeeded the
effervescence of the [[revolution]], and of those [[great]] [[men]] who had [[led]] the
revolution to a successful issue. the assembly which accepted the task
of composing the second [[constitution]] was small; *c but george washington
was its president, and it contained the choicest [[talents]] and the
noblest hearts [[heart]] which had ever appeared in the new [[world]]. this national
commission, after long and mature deliberation, offered to the
acceptance of the [[people]] the [[body]] of general laws [[law]] which still rules
the union. all the states adopted it successively. *d the new federal
government commenced its functions in 1789, after an interregnum of two
years. the [[revolution]] of [[america]] terminated when that of [[france]] began.

summary of the federal constitution

division of [[authority]] between the federal [[government]] and the states--the
government of the states is the [[rule]], the federal [[government]] the
exception.

the first [[question]] which awaited the americans was intricate, and by no
means easy of solution: the object was so to divide the [[authority]] of
the different states which composed the union that each of them should
continue to govern itself in all that concerned its internal [[prosperity]],
whilst the entire nation, represented by the union, should continue to
form a compact [[body]], and to provide for the general exigencies of the
people. it was as impossible to determine beforehand, with any degree
of accuracy, the share of [[authority]] which each of two governments [[government]] was to
enjoy, as to foresee all the incidents in the existence of a nation.

the obligations and the claims of the federal [[government]] were simple
and easily definable, because the union had been formed with the express
purpose of meeting the general exigencies of the [[people]]; but the claims
and obligations of the states were, on the other hand, complicated and
various, because those governments [[government]] had penetrated into all the details
of social [[life]]. the attributes of the federal [[government]] were therefore
carefully enumerated and all that was not included amongst them
was declared to constitute a part of the privileges [[privilege]] of the several
governments of the states. thus the [[government]] of the states remained
the [[rule]], and that of the confederation became the exception. *e

[footnote e: see the amendment to the federal [[constitution]];
"federalist," no. 32; story, p. 711; kent's "commentaries," vol. i. p.
364.

it is to be observed that whenever the exclusive [[right]] of regulating
certain matters is not reserved to congress by the [[constitution]], the
states may take up the affair until it is brought before the national
assembly. for instance, congress has the [[right]] of making a general law
on bankruptcy, which, however, it neglects to do. each [[state]] is then
at [[liberty]] to make a [[law]] for itself. this point has been established by
discussion in the law-courts, and may be said to belong more properly to
jurisprudence.]

but as it was foreseen that, in practice, questions [[question]] might arise as to
the exact limits of this exceptional [[authority]], and that it would be
dangerous to submit these questions [[question]] to the decision of the ordinary
courts of [[justice]], established in the states by the states themselves,
a high federal court was created, *f which was destined, amongst other
functions, to maintain the balance of [[power]] which had been established
by the [[constitution]] between the two rival governments [[government]]. *g

[footnote f: the action of this court is indirect, as we shall hereafter
show.]

[footnote g: it is thus that "the federalist," no. 45, explains the
division of [[supremacy]] between the union and the states: "the powers
delegated by the [[constitution]] to the federal [[government]] are few and
defined. those which are to remain in the [[state]] governments [[government]] are numerous
and indefinite. the former will be exercised principally on external
objects, as [[war]], [[peace]], negotiation, and [[foreign]] commerce. the powers
reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which,
in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the internal order and
prosperity of the [[state]]." i shall often have [[occasion]] to quote "the
federalist" in this [[work]]. when the bill which has since become the
constitution of the [[united]] states was submitted to the approval of
the [[people]], and the discussions were still pending, three [[men]], who
had already acquired a portion of that celebrity which they have since
enjoyed--john jay, hamilton, and madison--formed an association with
the intention of explaining to the nation the advantages of the measure
which was proposed. with this view they published a series of articles
in the shape of a journal, which now form a complete treatise. they
entitled their journal "the federalist," a name which has been retained
in the [[work]]. "the federalist" is an excellent [[book]], which ought to
be familiar to the statesmen of all countries [[country]], although it especially
concerns [[america]].]

prerogative of the federal government

power of declaring [[war]], making [[peace]], and levying general taxes vested
in the federal government--what part of the internal policy of the
country it may direct--the [[government]] of the union in some respects [[respect]] more
central than the king's [[government]] in the old french [[monarchy]].

the external relations of a [[people]] may be compared to those of private
individuals, and they cannot be advantageously maintained without the
agency of a [[single]] head of a [[government]]. the exclusive [[right]] of making
peace and [[war]], of concluding treaties of commerce, of raising armies [[army]],
and equipping fleets, was granted to the union. *h the necessity of
a national [[government]] was less imperiously [[felt]] in the conduct of the
internal policy of [[society]]; but there are [[certain]] general interests
which can only be attended to with advantage by a general [[authority]]. the
union was invested with the [[power]] of controlling the monetary [[system]], of
directing the post office, and of opening the [[great]] roads which were to
establish a communication between the different parts of the [[country]]. *i
the independence of the [[government]] of each [[state]] was formally recognized
in its sphere; nevertheless, the federal [[government]] was authorized
to interfere in the internal affairs of the states *j in a few
predetermined cases, in which an indiscreet [[abuse]] of their independence
might compromise the security of the union at large. thus, whilst
the [[power]] of modifying and changing their legislation at [[pleasure]] was
preserved in all the republics [[republic]], they were forbidden to enact ex post
facto laws [[law]], or to create a class of nobles [[noble]] in their [[community]]. *k
lastly, as it was necessary that the federal [[government]] should be able
to fulfil its engagements, it was endowed with an unlimited [[power]] of
levying taxes. *l

in examining the balance of [[power]] as established by the federal
constitution; in remarking on the one hand the portion of sovereignty
which has been reserved to the several states, and on the other the
share of [[power]] which the union has assumed, it is evident that the
federal legislators entertained the clearest and most accurate notions
on the [[nature]] of the centralization of [[government]]. the [[united]] states
form not only a [[republic]], but a confederation; nevertheless the
authority of the nation is more central than it was in several of the
monarchies of [[europe]] when the american [[constitution]] was formed. take,
for instance, the two following examples [[example]].

thirteen supreme courts of [[justice]] existed in [[france]], which, generally
speaking, had the [[right]] of interpreting the [[law]] without appeal; and
those provinces which were styled pays [[pay]] d'etats were authorized to refuse
their assent to an impost which had been levied by the [[sovereign]] who
represented the nation. in the union there is but one tribunal to
interpret, as there is one legislature to make the laws [[law]]; and an impost
voted by the representatives of the nation is binding upon all the
citizens. in these two essential points, therefore, the union exercises
more central [[authority]] than the french [[monarchy]] possessed, although the
union is only an assemblage of confederate republics [[republic]].

in [[spain]] [[certain]] provinces had the [[right]] of establishing a [[system]] of
custom-house duties [[duty]] peculiar to themselves, although that privilege
belongs, by its very [[nature]], to the national sovereignty. in [[america]] the
congress alone has the [[right]] of regulating the commercial relations
of the states. the [[government]] of the confederation is therefore more
centralized in this [[respect]] than the [[kingdom]] of [[spain]]. it is true that
the [[power]] of the [[crown]] in [[france]] or in [[spain]] was always able to obtain
by [[force]] whatever the [[constitution]] of the [[country]] denied, and that the
ultimate result was consequently the same; but i am here discussing the
theory of the [[constitution]].

federal powers

after having settled the limits within which the federal government
was to act, the next point was to determine the powers [[power]] which it was to
exert.

legislative powers [[power]] *m

[footnote m: [in this [[chapter]] the author points out the essence of the
conflict between the seceding states and the union which caused the
civil [[war]] of 1861.]]

division of the legislative [[body]] into two branches--difference in the
manner of forming the two houses--the [[principle]] of the independence of
the states predominates in the formation of the senate--the principle
of the sovereignty of the nation in the composition of the house of
representatives--singular effects of the [[fact]] that a [[constitution]] can
only be logical in the early stages of a nation.

the plan which had been laid down beforehand for the constitutions [[constitution]] of
the several states was followed, in many points, in the organization
of the powers [[power]] of the union. the federal legislature of the union
was composed of a senate and a house of representatives. a spirit of
conciliation prescribed the observance of distinct principles [[principle]] in
the formation of these two assemblies. i have already shown that two
contrary interests were opposed to each other in the establishment of
the federal [[constitution]]. these two interests had given rise to two
opinions. it was the [[wish]] of one party to convert the union into a
league of independent states, or a sort of congress, at which the
representatives of the several peoples [[people]] would meet to discuss certain
points of their [[common]] interests. the other party [[desired]] to unite
the inhabitants of the american colonies into one sole nation, and to
establish a [[government]] which should act as the sole representative of
the nation, as far as the limited sphere of its [[authority]] would permit.
the practical consequences of these two theories were exceedingly
different.

the [[question]] was, whether a league was to be established instead of a
national [[government]]; whether the majority of the [[state]], instead of the
majority of the inhabitants of the union, was to give the [[law]]: for every
state, the small as well as the [[great]], would then remain in the full
enjoyment of its independence, and enter the union upon a footing of
perfect equality. if, however, the inhabitants of the [[united]] states were
to be considered as belonging to one and the same nation, it would be
just that the majority of the [[citizens]] of the union should prescribe the
law. of course the lesser states could not subscribe to the application
of this doctrine without, in [[fact]], abdicating their existence in
relation to the sovereignty of the confederation; since they would have
passed from the condition of a co-equal and co-legislative [[authority]] to
that of an insignificant fraction of a [[great]] [[people]]. but if the former
system would have invested them with an excessive [[authority]], the
latter would have annulled their influence altogether. under these
circumstances the result was, that the strict rules [[rule]] of [[logic]] were
evaded, as is usually the case when interests are opposed to arguments.
a middle course was hit upon by the legislators, which brought together
by [[force]] two systems [[system]] theoretically irreconcilable.

the [[principle]] of the independence of the states prevailed in the
formation of the senate, and that of the sovereignty of the nation
predominated in the composition of the house of representatives. it
was decided that each [[state]] should send two senators to congress, and a
number of representatives proportioned to its [[population]]. *n it results
from this arrangement that the [[state]] of new york has at the [[present]] day
forty representatives and only two senators; the [[state]] of delaware
has two senators and only one representative; the [[state]] of delaware
is therefore [[equal]] to the [[state]] of new york in the senate, whilst the
latter has forty times [[time]] the influence of the former in the house of
representatives. thus, if the minority of the nation preponderates in
the senate,. it may paralyze the decisions of the majority represented
in the other house, which is contrary to the spirit of constitutional
government.

[footnote n: every ten years congress fixes anew the number of
representatives which each [[state]] is to furnish. the total number was 69
in 1789, and 240 in 1833. (see "american almanac," 1834, p. 194.)
the [[constitution]] decided that there should not be more than one
representative for every 30,000 persons [[person]]; but no minimum was fixed
on. the congress has not [[thought]] fit to augment the number of
representatives in proportion to the increase of [[population]]. the first
act which was passed on the [[subject]] (april 14, 1792: see "laws of the
united states," by story, vol. i. p. 235) decided that there should be
one representative for every 33,000 inhabitants. the [[last]] act, which was
passed in 1832, fixes the proportion at one for 48,000. the population
represented is composed of all the [[free]] [[men]] and of three-fifths of the
slaves.

[the [[last]] act of apportionment, passed february 2, 1872, fixes the
representation at one to 134,684 inhabitants. there are now (1875) 283
members of the lower house of congress, and 9 for the states at large,
making in all 292 members. the old states have of course lost the
representatives which the new states have gained.--translator's note.]]

these facts [[fact]] show how rare and how difficult it is rationally and
logically to combine all the several parts of legislation. in the
course of [[time]] different interests arise, and different principles [[principle]] are
sanctioned by the same [[people]]; and when a general [[constitution]] is to
be established, these interests and principles [[principle]] are so many natural
obstacles to the rigorous application of any [[political]] [[system]], with all
its consequences. the early stages of national existence are the only
periods at which it is possible to maintain the complete [[logic]] of
legislation; and when we perceive a nation in the enjoyment of this
advantage, before we hasten to conclude that it is [[wise]], we should do
well to [[remember]] that it is [[young]]. when the federal [[constitution]] was
formed, the interests of independence for the separate states, and the
interest of union for the whole [[people]], were the only two conflicting
interests which existed amongst the anglo-americans, and a compromise
was necessarily made between them.

it is, however, just to acknowledge that this part of the constitution
has not hitherto produced those evils [[evil]] which might have been feared. all
the states are [[young]] and contiguous; their customs, their ideas [[idea]], and
their exigencies are not dissimilar; and the differences which result
from their size or inferiority do not suffice to set their interests
at variance. the small states have consequently never been induced to
league themselves together in the senate to oppose the designs of the
larger ones; and indeed there is so irresistible an [[authority]] in the
legitimate expression of the will of a [[people]] that the senate could
offer but a feeble opposition to the vote of the majority of the house
of representatives.

it must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that it was not in the
power of the american legislators to reduce to a [[single]] nation the
people for whom they were making laws [[law]]. the object of the federal
constitution was not to [[destroy]] the independence of the states, but
to restrain it. by acknowledging the real [[authority]] of these secondary
communities (and it was impossible to deprive them of it), they
disavowed beforehand the habitual use of constraint in enforcing g the
decisions of the majority. upon this [[principle]] the introduction of the
influence of the states into the mechanism of the federal [[government]] was
by no means to be wondered at, since it only attested the existence of
an acknowledged [[power]], which was to be humored and not forcibly checked.

a further difference between the senate and the house of representatives

the senate named by the provincial legislators, the representatives
by the people--double election of the former; [[single]] election of the
latter--term of the different offices--peculiar functions of each house.

the senate not only differs from the other house in the [[principle]] which
it represents, but also in the mode of its election, in the term for
which it is chosen, and in the [[nature]] of its functions. the house of
representatives is named by the [[people]], the senate by the legislators of
each [[state]]; the former is directly elected, the latter is elected by an
elected [[body]]; the term for which the representatives are chosen is only
two years, that of the senators is six. the functions of the house of
representatives are purely legislative, and the only share it takes in
the judicial [[power]] is in the impeachment of [[public]] officers. the senate
co-operates in the [[work]] of legislation, and tries those political
offences which the house of representatives submits to its decision.
it also acts as the [[great]] executive council of the nation; the treaties
which are concluded by the president must be ratified by the senate,
and the appointments he may make must be definitely approved by the same
body. *o

[footnote o: see "the federalist," nos. 52-56, inclusive; story,
pp. 199-314; [[constitution]] of the [[united]] states, sects. 2 and 3.] the
executive [[power]] *p

[footnote p: see "the federalist," nos. 67-77; [[constitution]] of
the [[united]] states, art [[arts]]. 2; story, p. 315, pp. 615-780; kent's
"commentaries," p. 255.]

dependence of the president--he is elective and responsible--he is
free to act in his own sphere under the inspection, but not under
the direction, of the senate--his salary fixed at his entry into
office--suspensive veto.

the american legislators undertook a difficult task in attempting to
create an executive [[power]] dependent on the majority of the [[people]], and
nevertheless sufficiently [[strong]] to act without restraint in its own
sphere. it was indispensable to the maintenance of the republican form
of [[government]] that the representative of the executive [[power]] should be
subject to the will of the nation.

the president is an elective magistrate. his [[honor]], his [[property]], his
liberty, and his [[life]] are the securities which the [[people]] has for the
temperate use of his [[power]]. but in the exercise of his [[authority]] he
cannot be said to be perfectly independent; the senate takes cognizance
of his relations with [[foreign]] powers [[power]], and of the distribution of public
appointments, so that he can neither be bribed nor can he employ the
means of [[corruption]]. the legislators of the union acknowledged that the
executive [[power]] would be incompetent to fulfil its task with [[dignity]] and
utility, unless it enjoyed a greater [[degree]] of stability and of strength
than had been granted to it in the separate states.

the president is chosen for four years, and he may be reelected; so that
the chances [[chance]] of a prolonged administration may inspire him with hopeful
undertakings for the [[public]] [[good]], and with the means of carrying them
into execution. the president was made the sole representative of the
executive [[power]] of the union, and [[care]] was taken not to render his
decisions subordinate to the vote of a council--a dangerous measure,
which tends at the same [[time]] to clog the action of the [[government]] and
to diminish its responsibility. the senate has the [[right]] of annulling
g [[certain]] acts of the president; but it cannot compel him to take any
steps, nor does it participate in the exercise of the executive [[power]].

the action of the legislature on the executive [[power]] may be direct; and
we have just shown that the americans carefully obviated this influence;
but it may, on the other hand, be indirect. [[public]] assemblies which have
the [[power]] of depriving an officer of [[state]] of his salary encroach upon
his independence; and as they are [[free]] to make the laws [[law]], it is to be
feared lest they should gradually appropriate to themselves a portion
of that [[authority]] which the [[constitution]] had vested in his hands. this
dependence of the executive [[power]] is one of the defects inherent in
republican constitutions [[constitution]]. the americans have not been able to counteract
the tendency which legislative assemblies have to get possession of the
government, but they have rendered this propensity less irresistible.
the salary of the president is fixed, at the [[time]] of his entering
upon office, for the whole period of his magistracy. the president is,
moreover, provided with a suspensive veto, which allows him to oppose
the passing of such laws [[law]] as might [[destroy]] the portion of independence
which the [[constitution]] awards him. the struggle between the president
and the legislature must always be an unequal one, since the latter is
certain of bearing down all [[resistance]] by persevering in its plans; but
the suspensive veto forces [[force]] it at least to reconsider the matter, and,
if the motion be persisted in, it must then be backed by a majority of
two-thirds of the whole house. the veto is, in [[fact]], a sort of appeal
to the [[people]]. the executive [[power]], which, without this security, might
have been secretly [[oppressed]], adopts this means of pleading its
cause and stating its motives. but if the legislature is [[certain]] of
overpowering all [[resistance]] by persevering in its plans, i reply, that
in the constitutions [[constitution]] of all nations, of whatever [[kind]] they may be, a
certain point exists at which the legislator is obliged to have recourse
to the [[good]] sense and the [[virtue]] of his fellow-citizens. this point is
more prominent and more discoverable in republics [[republic]], whilst it is more
remote and more carefully concealed in monarchies [[monarchy]], but it always exists
somewhere. there is no [[country]] in the [[world]] in which everything can be
provided for by the laws [[law]], or in which [[political]] [[institutions]] can prove a
substitute for [[common]] sense and [[public]] morality.

differences between the position of the president of the [[united]] states
and that of a constitutional [[king]] of france

executive [[power]] in the northern states as limited and as partial as the
supremacy which it represents--executive [[power]] in [[france]] as universal as
the [[supremacy]] it represents--the [[king]] a branch of the legislature--the
president the mere executor of the law--other differences resulting from
the duration of the two powers--the president checked in the exercise
of the executive authority--the [[king]] independent in its
exercise--notwithstanding these discrepancies [[france]] is more akin to
a [[republic]] than the union to a monarchy--comparison of the number of
public officers depending upon the executive [[power]] in the two countries [[country]].

the executive [[power]] has so important an influence on the destinies of
nations that i am inclined to pause for an instant at this portion of
my [[subject]], in order more clearly to explain the part it sustains
in [[america]]. in order to form an accurate [[idea]] of the position of the
president of the [[united]] states, it may not be irrelevant to compare it
to that of one of the constitutional kings [[king]] of [[europe]]. in this comparison
i shall [[pay]] but little attention to the external signs of [[power]], which
are more apt to [[deceive]] the eye of the observer than to guide his
researches. when a [[monarchy]] is being gradually transformed into a
republic, the executive [[power]] retains the titles, the honors, the
etiquette, and even the funds of royalty long after its [[authority]] has
disappeared. the english, after having cut off the head of one king
and expelled another from his [[throne]], were accustomed to accost the
successor of those princes [[prince]] upon their knees. on the other hand, when a
republic falls under the sway of a [[single]] [[individual]], the demeanor of
the [[sovereign]] is simple and unpretending, as if his [[authority]] was not
yet paramount. when the emperors [[emperor]] exercised an unlimited control over
the fortunes [[fortune]] and the lives [[life]] of their fellow-citizens, it was customary to
call them caesar in conversation, and they were in the habit of supping
without formality at their friends' houses. it is therefore necessary to
look below the surface.

the sovereignty of the [[united]] states is shared between the union and the
states, whilst in [[france]] it is undivided and compact: hence arises the
first and the most notable difference which exists between the president
of the [[united]] states and the [[king]] of [[france]]. in the [[united]] states the
executive [[power]] is as limited and partial as the sovereignty of the
union in whose name it acts; in [[france]] it is as universal as the
authority of the [[state]]. the americans have a federal and the french a
national [[government]].




chapter viii: the federal constitution--part ii

this cause of inferiority results from the [[nature]] of things, but it is
not the only one; the second in importance is as follows: sovereignty
may be defined to be the [[right]] of making laws [[law]]: in [[france]], the king
really exercises a portion of the [[sovereign]] [[power]], since the laws [[law]] have
no weight till he has given his assent to them; he is, moreover, the
executor of all they ordain. the president is also the executor of the
laws, but he does not really co-operate in their formation, since the
refusal of his assent does not annul them. he is therefore merely to be
considered as the agent of the [[sovereign]] [[power]]. but not only does
the [[king]] of [[france]] exercise a portion of the [[sovereign]] [[power]], he also
contributes to the nomination of the legislature, which exercises the
other portion. he has the [[privilege]] of appointing the members of one
chamber, and of dissolving the other at his [[pleasure]]; whereas the
president of the [[united]] states has no share in the formation of the
legislative [[body]], and cannot dissolve any part of it. the [[king]] has the
same [[right]] of bringing forward measures as the chambers; a [[right]] which
the president does not possess. the [[king]] is represented in each assembly
by his ministers, who explain his intentions, support his opinions [[opinion]],
and maintain the principles [[principle]] of the [[government]]. the president and his
ministers are alike excluded from congress; so that his influence and
his opinions [[opinion]] can only penetrate indirectly into that [[great]] [[body]]. the
king of [[france]] is therefore on an [[equal]] footing with the legislature,
which can no more act without him than he can without it. the president
exercises an [[authority]] inferior to, and depending upon, that of the
legislature.

even in the exercise of the executive [[power]], properly so called--the
point upon which his position seems to be most analogous to that of
the [[king]] of france--the president labors under several causes of
inferiority. the [[authority]] of the [[king]], in [[france]], has, in the first
place, the advantage of duration over that of the president, and
durability is one of the [[chief]] elements of [[strength]]; nothing is either
loved or feared but what is likely to endure. the president of the
united states is a magistrate elected for four years; the [[king]], in
france, is an hereditary [[sovereign]]. in the exercise of the executive
power the president of the [[united]] states is constantly [[subject]] to a
jealous scrutiny. he may make, but he cannot conclude, a treaty; he
may designate, but he cannot appoint, a [[public]] officer. *q the [[king]] of
france is absolute within the limits of his [[authority]]. the president of
the [[united]] states is responsible for his actions; but the [[person]] of the
king is declared inviolable by the french charter. *r

[footnote q: the [[constitution]] had left it doubtful whether the president
was obliged to consult the senate in the removal as well as in the
appointment of federal officers. "the federalist" (no. 77) seemed to
establish the affirmative; but in 1789 congress formally decided that,
as the president was responsible for his actions, he ought not to
be forced to employ agents who had forfeited his esteem. see kent's
"commentaries", vol. i. p. 289.]

[footnote r: [this comparison applied to the constitutional [[king]] of
france and to the powers [[power]] he held under the charter of 1830, till the
overthrow of the [[monarchy]] in 1848.--translator's note.]]

nevertheless, the [[supremacy]] of [[public]] [[opinion]] is no less above the head
of the one than of the other. this [[power]] is less definite, less evident,
and less sanctioned by the laws [[law]] in [[france]] than in [[america]], but in fact
it exists. in [[america]], it acts by elections and decrees; in [[france]] it
proceeds by revolutions [[revolution]]; but notwithstanding the different constitutions
of these two countries [[country]], [[public]] [[opinion]] is the predominant authority
in both of them. the fundamental [[principle]] of legislation--a principle
essentially republican--is the same in both countries [[country]], although its
consequences may be different, and its results more or less extensive.
whence i am [[led]] to conclude that [[france]] with its [[king]] is nearer akin to
a [[republic]] than the union with its president is to a [[monarchy]].

in what i have been saying i have only touched upon the main points
of distinction; and if i could have entered into details, the contrast
would have been rendered still more striking. i have remarked that the
authority of the president in the [[united]] states is only exercised within
the limits of a partial sovereignty, whilst that of the [[king]] in france
is undivided. i might have gone on to show that the [[power]] of the king's
government in [[france]] exceeds its [[natural]] limits, however extensive
they may be, and penetrates in a thousand different ways into the
administration of private interests. amongst the examples [[example]] of this
influence may be quoted that which results from the [[great]] number
of [[public]] functionaries, who all derive their appointments from the
government. this number now exceeds all previous limits; it amounts to
138,000 *s nominations, each of which may be considered as an element of
power. the president of the [[united]] states has not the exclusive [[right]] of
making any [[public]] appointments, and their whole number scarcely exceeds
12,000. *t

[footnote s: the sums annually paid by the [[state]] to these officers
amount to 200,000,000 fr. ($40,000,000).]

[footnote t: this number is extracted from the "national calendar" for
1833. the "national calendar" is an american almanac which contains the
names of all the federal officers. it results from this comparison that
the [[king]] of [[france]] has eleven times [[time]] as many places at his disposal as
the president, although the [[population]] of [[france]] is not much more than
double that of the union.

[i have not the means of ascertaining the number of appointments now at
the disposal of the president of the [[united]] states, but his patronage
and the [[abuse]] of it have largely increased since 1833.--translator's
note, 1875.]]

accidental causes which may increase the influence of the executive
government

external security of the union--army of six thousand men--few ships--the
president has no opportunity of exercising his [[great]] prerogatives--in
the prerogatives he exercises he is [[weak]].

if the executive [[government]] is feebler in [[america]] than in [[france]], the
cause is more attributable to the circumstances than to the laws [[law]] of the
country.

it is chiefly in its [[foreign]] relations that the executive [[power]] of a
nation is called upon to exert its [[skill]] and its vigor. if the existence
of the union were perpetually threatened, and if its [[chief]] interests
were in daily connection with those of other powerful nations, the
executive [[government]] would assume an increased importance in proportion
to the measures expected of it, and those which it would carry into
effect. the president of the [[united]] states is the commander-in-chief of
the [[army]], but of an [[army]] composed of only six thousand [[men]]; he commands
the fleet, but the fleet reckons but few sail; he conducts the foreign
relations of the union, but the [[united]] states are a nation without
neighbors. separated from the rest of the [[world]] by the ocean, and too
weak as yet to aim at the dominion of the seas, they have no enemies [[enemy]],
and their interests rarely come into contact with those of any other
nation of the globe.

the practical part of a [[government]] must not be judged by the theory
of its [[constitution]]. the president of the [[united]] states is in the
possession of almost [[royal]] prerogatives, which he has no opportunity of
exercising; and those privileges [[privilege]] which he can at [[present]] use are very
circumscribed. the laws [[law]] allow him to possess a [[degree]] of influence which
circumstances do not permit him to employ.

on the other hand, the [[great]] [[strength]] of the [[royal]] prerogative in
france arises from circumstances far more than from the laws [[law]]. there
the executive [[government]] is constantly struggling against prodigious
obstacles, and exerting all its energies to repress them; so that it
increases by the extent of its achievements, and by the importance of
the events it controls, without modifying its [[constitution]]. if the laws
had made it as feeble and as circumscribed as it is in the union, its
influence would very soon become still more preponderant.

why the president of the [[united]] states does not require the majority of
the two houses in order to carry on the [[government]] it is an established
axiom in [[europe]] that a constitutional [[king]] cannot persevere in a
system of [[government]] which is opposed by the two other branches of the
legislature. but several presidents of the [[united]] states have been known
to lose the majority in the legislative [[body]] without being obliged to
abandon the supreme [[power]], and without inflicting a serious evil
upon [[society]]. i have heard this [[fact]] quoted as an instance of the
independence and the [[power]] of the executive [[government]] in [[america]]: a
moment's reflection will convince us, on the contrary, that it is a
proof of its extreme weakness.

a [[king]] in [[europe]] requires the support of the legislature to enable him
to perform the duties [[duty]] imposed upon him by the [[constitution]], because
those duties [[duty]] are enormous. a constitutional [[king]] in [[europe]] is not merely
the executor of the [[law]], but the execution of its provisions devolves so
completely upon him that he has the [[power]] of paralyzing its influence
if it opposes his designs. he requires the assistance of the legislative
assemblies to make the [[law]], but those assemblies stand in need of his
aid to execute it: these two authorities [[authority]] cannot subsist without each
other, and the mechanism of [[government]] is stopped as soon as they are at
variance.

in [[america]] the president cannot prevent any [[law]] from being passed, nor
can he evade the obligation of enforcing it. his sincere and zealous
co-operation is no [[doubt]] useful, but it is not indispensable, in the
carrying on of [[public]] affairs. all his important acts are directly or
indirectly submitted to the legislature, and of his own [[free]] authority
he can do but little. it is therefore his weakness, and not his [[power]],
which enables him to remain in opposition to congress. in [[europe]],
harmony must reign between the [[crown]] and the other branches of the
legislature, because a collision between them may prove serious; in
america, this harmony is not indispensable, because such a collision is
impossible.

election of the president


dangers of the elective [[system]] increase in proportion to the extent of
the prerogative--this [[system]] possible in [[america]] because no powerful
executive [[authority]] is required--what circumstances are favorable to
the elective system--why the election of the president does not cause
a deviation from the principles [[principle]] of the government--influence of the
election of the president on secondary functionaries.

the dangers of the [[system]] of election applied to the head of the
executive [[government]] of a [[great]] [[people]] have been sufficiently
exemplified by [[experience]] and by [[history]], and the remarks i am about
to make refer to [[america]] alone. these dangers may be more or less
formidable in proportion to the place which the executive power
occupies, and to the importance it possesses in the [[state]]; and they may
vary according to the mode of election and the circumstances in which
the electors are placed. the most weighty argument against the election
of a [[chief]] magistrate is, that it offers so splendid a lure to private
ambition, and is so apt to inflame [[men]] in the pursuit of [[power]], that
when legitimate means are wanting [[force]] may not unfrequently seize what
right denied.

it is clear that the greater the privileges [[privilege]] of the executive authority
are, the greater is the temptation; the more the [[ambition]] of the
candidates is excited, the more warmly are their interests espoused by
a throng of partisans who [[hope]] to share the [[power]] when their patron has
won the prize. the dangers of the elective [[system]] increase, therefore,
in the exact ratio of the influence exercised by the executive power
in the affairs of [[state]]. the revolutions [[revolution]] of poland were not solely
attributable to the elective [[system]] in general, but to the [[fact]] that the
elected monarch was the [[sovereign]] of a powerful [[kingdom]]. before we can
discuss the absolute advantages of the elective [[system]] we must make
preliminary inquiries as to whether the geographical position, the laws [[law]],
the habits, the manners, and the opinions [[opinion]] of the [[people]] amongst whom
it is to be introduced will admit of the establishment of a weak
and dependent executive [[government]]; for to attempt to render the
representative of the [[state]] a powerful [[sovereign]], and at the same time
elective, is, in my [[opinion]], to entertain two incompatible designs. to
reduce hereditary royalty to the condition of an elective [[authority]], the
only means that i am acquainted with are to circumscribe its sphere
of action beforehand, gradually to diminish its prerogatives, and to
accustom the [[people]] to [[live]] without its protection. nothing, however, is
further from the designs of the republicans of [[europe]] than this course:
as many of them owe their [[hatred]] of [[tyranny]] to the sufferings which they
have personally undergone, it is oppression, and not the extent of the
executive [[power]], which excites their hostility, and they attack the
former without perceiving how nearly it is connected with the latter.

hitherto no citizen has shown any disposition to expose his [[honor]] and
his [[life]] in order to become the president of the [[united]] states; because
the [[power]] of that office is temporary, limited, and subordinate. the
prize of [[fortune]] must be [[great]] to encourage adventurers in so desperate
a game. no candidate has as yet been able to arouse the dangerous
enthusiasm or the passionate sympathies of the [[people]] in his favor, for
the very simple [[reason]] that when he is at the head of the [[government]] he
has but little [[power]], but little [[wealth]], and but little [[glory]] to share
amongst his [[friends]]; and his influence in the [[state]] is too small for
the [[success]] or the ruin of a faction to depend upon the elevation of an
individual to [[power]].

the [[great]] advantage of hereditary monarchies [[monarchy]] is, that as the private
interest of a [[family]] is always intimately connected with the interests
of the [[state]], the executive [[government]] is never suspended for a single
instant; and if the affairs of a [[monarchy]] are not [[better]] conducted than
those of a [[republic]], at least there is always some one to conduct them,
well or ill, according to his capacity. in elective states, on the
contrary, the wheels of [[government]] cease to act, as it were, of their
own accord at the approach of an election, and even for some time
previous to that event. the laws [[law]] may indeed accelerate the operation of
the election, which may be conducted with such simplicity and rapidity
that the seat of [[power]] will never be left vacant; but, notwithstanding
these precautions, a break necessarily occurs in the minds [[mind]] of the
people.

at the approach of an election the head of the executive [[government]] is
wholly occupied by the coming struggle; his future plans are doubtful;
he can undertake nothing new, and the he will only prosecute with
indifference those designs which another will perhaps terminate. "i am
so near the [[time]] of my retirement from office," said president jefferson
on the 21st of january, 1809 (six weeks before the election), "that i
feel no passion, i take no part, i express no sentiment. it appears
to me just to leave to my successor the commencement of those measures
which he will have to prosecute, and for which he will be responsible."

on the other hand, the [[eyes]] of the nation are centred on a [[single]] point;
all are watching the gradual birth of so important an event. the wider
the influence of the executive [[power]] extends, the greater and the
more necessary is its constant action, the more fatal is the term of
suspense; and a nation which is accustomed to the [[government]], or, still
more, one used to the administrative protection of a powerful executive
authority would be infallibly convulsed by an election of this [[kind]].
in the [[united]] states the action of the [[government]] may be slackened with
impunity, because it is always [[weak]] and circumscribed. *u

[footnote u: [this, however, may be a [[great]] danger. the period during
which mr. buchanan retained office, after the election of mr. lincoln,
from november, 1860, to march, 1861, was that which enabled the seceding
states of the south to complete their preparations for the civil [[war]],
and the executive [[government]] was paralyzed. no greater [[evil]] could befall
a nation.--translator's note.]]

one of the principal vices [[vice]] of the elective [[system]] is that it always
introduces a [[certain]] [[degree]] of instability into the internal and
external policy of the [[state]]. but this disadvantage is less sensibly
felt if the share of [[power]] vested in the elected magistrate is small. in
rome the principles [[principle]] of the [[government]] underwent no variation, although
the consuls were changed every year, because the senate, which was an
hereditary assembly, possessed the directing [[authority]]. if the elective
system were adopted in [[europe]], the condition of most of the monarchical
states would be changed at every new election. in [[america]] the president
exercises a [[certain]] influence on [[state]] affairs, but he does not conduct
them; the preponderating [[power]] is vested in the representatives of the
whole nation. the [[political]] maxims [[maxim]] of the [[country]] depend therefore on
the mass of the [[people]], not on the president alone; and consequently
in [[america]] the elective [[system]] has no very prejudicial influence on the
fixed principles [[principle]] of the [[government]]. but the want of fixed principles [[principle]] is
an [[evil]] so inherent in the elective [[system]] that it is still extremely
perceptible in the narrow sphere to which the [[authority]] of the president
extends.

the americans have admitted that the head of the executive [[power]], who
has to bear the whole responsibility of the duties [[duty]] he is called upon to
fulfil, ought to be empowered to choose his own agents, and to remove
them at [[pleasure]]: the legislative bodies [[body]] watch the conduct of the
president more than they direct it. the consequence of this arrangement
is, that at every new election the [[fate]] of all the federal public
officers is in suspense. mr. quincy adams, on his entry into office,
discharged the majority of the individuals [[individual]] who had been appointed by his
predecessor: and i am not aware that general jackson allowed a single
removable functionary employed in the federal service to retain
his place beyond the first year which succeeded his election. it
is sometimes made a [[subject]] of complaint that in the constitutional
monarchies of [[europe]] the [[fate]] of the humbler servants of an
administration depends upon that of the ministers. but in elective
governments this [[evil]] is far greater. in a constitutional monarchy
successive ministries are rapidly formed; but as the principal
representative of the executive [[power]] does not [[change]], the spirit of
innovation is kept within bounds; the changes [[change]] which take place are in
the details rather than in the principles [[principle]] of the administrative [[system]];
but to substitute one [[system]] for another, as is done in america
every four years, by [[law]], is to cause a sort of [[revolution]]. as to the
misfortunes which may fall upon individuals [[individual]] in consequence of this state
of things, it must be allowed that the uncertain situation of the
public officers is less fraught with [[evil]] consequences in [[america]] than
elsewhere. it is so easy to acquire an independent position in the
united states that the [[public]] officer who loses his place may be
deprived of the comforts of [[life]], but not of the means of subsistence.

i remarked at the beginning of this [[chapter]] that the dangers of the
elective [[system]] applied to the head of the [[state]] are augmented or
decreased by the peculiar circumstances of the [[people]] which adopts it.
however the functions of the executive [[power]] may be restricted, it
must always exercise a [[great]] influence upon the [[foreign]] policy of the
country, for a negotiation cannot be opened or successfully carried
on otherwise than by a [[single]] agent. the more precarious and the more
perilous the position of a [[people]] becomes, the more absolute is the want
of a fixed and consistent external policy, and the more dangerous does
the elective [[system]] of the [[chief]] magistrate become. the policy of the
americans in relation to the whole [[world]] is exceedingly simple; for it
may almost be said that no [[country]] stands in need of them, nor do they
require the co-operation of any other [[people]]. their independence is
never threatened. in their [[present]] condition, therefore, the functions
of the executive [[power]] are no less limited by circumstances than by the
laws; and the president may frequently [[change]] his line of policy without
involving the [[state]] in difficulty or destruction.

whatever the prerogatives of the executive [[power]] may be, the period
which immediately precedes an election and the moment of its duration
must always be considered as a national crisis, which is perilous in
proportion to the internal embarrassments and the external dangers of
the [[country]]. few of the nations of [[europe]] could escape the calamities
of [[anarchy]] or of [[conquest]] every [[time]] they might have to elect a new
sovereign. in [[america]] [[society]] is so constituted that it can stand
without assistance upon its own basis; nothing is to be feared from the
pressure of external dangers, and the election of the president is a
cause of agitation, but not of ruin.

mode of election

skill of the american legislators shown in the mode of election adopted
by them--creation of a special electoral body--separate votes of these
electors--case in which the house of representatives is called upon to
choose the president--results of the twelve elections which have taken
place since the [[constitution]] has been established.

besides the dangers which are inherent in the [[system]], many other
difficulties may arise from the mode of election, which may be obviated
by the precaution of the legislator. when a [[people]] met in arms on some
public spot to choose its head, it was exposed to all the chances [[chance]] of
civil [[war]] resulting from so martial a mode of proceeding, besides
the dangers of the elective [[system]] in itself. the polish laws [[law]], which
subjected the election of the [[sovereign]] to the veto of a single
individual, suggested the murder of that [[individual]] or prepared the way
to [[anarchy]].

in the examination of the [[institutions]] and the [[political]] as well as
social condition of the [[united]] states, we are struck by the admirable
harmony of the gifts of [[fortune]] and the efforts of [[man]]. the nation
possessed two of the main causes of internal [[peace]]; it was a new
country, but it was inhabited by a [[people]] grown old in the exercise of
freedom. [[america]] had no hostile neighbors to dread; and the american
legislators, profiting by these favorable circumstances, created a
weak and subordinate executive [[power]] which could without danger be made
elective.

it then only remained for them to choose the least dangerous of the
various modes of election; and the rules [[rule]] which they laid down upon this
point admirably correspond to the securities which the physical and
political [[constitution]] of the [[country]] already afforded. their object was
to find the mode of election which would [[best]] express the [[choice]] of the
people with the least possible excitement and suspense. it was admitted
in the first place that the simple majority should be decisive; but
the difficulty was to obtain this majority without an interval of
delay which it was most important to avoid. it rarely happens that an
individual can at once collect the majority of the suffrages of a great
people; and this difficulty is enhanced in a [[republic]] of confederate
states, where local influences are apt to preponderate. the means by
which it was proposed to obviate this second obstacle was to delegate
the electoral powers [[power]] of the nation to a [[body]] of representatives. this
mode of election rendered a majority more probable; for the fewer the
electors are, the greater is the [[chance]] of their coming to a final
decision. it also offered an additional probability of a judicious
choice. it then remained to be decided whether this [[right]] of election
was to be entrusted to a legislative [[body]], the habitual representative
assembly of the nation, or whether an electoral assembly should be
formed for the express [[purpose]] of proceeding to the nomination of a
president. the americans chose the latter alternative, from a belief
that the individuals [[individual]] who were returned to make the laws [[law]] were incompetent
to represent the wishes [[wish]] of the nation in the election of its chief
magistrate; and that, as they are chosen for more than a year, the
constituency they represent might have changed its [[opinion]] in that [[time]].
it was [[thought]] that if the legislature was empowered to elect the head
of the executive [[power]], its members would, for some [[time]] before the
election, be exposed to the manoeuvres of [[corruption]] and the tricks of
intrigue; whereas the special electors would, like a jury, remain mixed
up with the crowd till the day of action, when they would appear for the
sole [[purpose]] of giving their votes.

it was therefore established that every [[state]] should name a certain
number of electors, *v who in their turn should elect the president;
and as it had been observed that the assemblies to which the [[choice]] of
a [[chief]] magistrate had been entrusted in elective countries [[country]] inevitably
became the centres of passion and of cabal; that they sometimes usurped
an [[authority]] which did not belong to them; and that their proceedings,
or the uncertainty which resulted from them, were sometimes prolonged so
much as to endanger the welfare of the [[state]], it was determined that the
electors should all vote upon the same day, without being convoked to
the same place. *w this double election rendered a majority probable,
though not [[certain]]; for it was possible that as many differences might
exist between the electors as between their constituents. in this case
it was necessary to have recourse to one of three measures; either
to appoint new electors, or to consult a second [[time]] those already
appointed, or to defer the election to another [[authority]]. the first
two of these alternatives, independently of the uncertainty of their
results, were likely to delay the final decision, and to perpetuate
an agitation which must always be accompanied with danger. the third
expedient was therefore adopted, and it was agreed that the votes should
be transmitted sealed to the president of the senate, and that they
should be opened and counted in the presence of the senate and the house
of representatives. if none of the candidates has a majority, the house
of representatives then proceeds immediately to elect a president, but
with the condition that it must fix upon one of the three candidates who
have the highest numbers. *x

[footnote v: as many as it sends members to congress. the number of
electors at the election of 1833 was 288. (see "the national calendar,"
1833.)]

[footnote w: the electors of the same [[state]] assemble, but they transmit
to the central [[government]] the list of their [[individual]] votes, and not
the mere result of the vote of the majority.] [footnote x: in this case
it is the majority of the states, and not the majority of the members,
which decides the [[question]]; so that new york has not more influence in
the debate than rhode island. thus the [[citizens]] of the union are first
consulted as members of one and the same [[community]]; and, if they cannot
agree, recourse is had to the division of the states, each of which has
a separate and independent vote. this is one of the singularities of
the federal [[constitution]] which can only be explained by the jar of
conflicting interests.]

thus it is only in case of an event which cannot often happen, and which
can never be foreseen, that the election is entrusted to the ordinary
representatives of the nation; and even then they are obliged to choose
a citizen who has already been designated by a powerful minority of the
special electors. it is by this [[happy]] expedient that the [[respect]] which
is due to the popular voice is combined with the utmost celerity of
execution and those precautions which the [[peace]] of the [[country]] demands.
but the decision of the [[question]] by the house of representatives does
not necessarily offer an immediate solution of the difficulty, for the
majority of that assembly may still be doubtful, and in this case the
constitution prescribes no remedy. nevertheless, by restricting the
number of candidates to three, and by referring the matter to the
judgment of an enlightened [[public]] [[body]], it has smoothed all the
obstacles *y which are not inherent in the elective [[system]].

[footnote y: jefferson, in 1801, was not elected until the thirty-sixth
time of balloting.]


in the forty-four years which have elapsed since the promulgation of
the federal [[constitution]] the [[united]] states have twelve times [[time]] chosen a
president. ten of these elections took place simultaneously by the
votes of the special electors in the different states. the house of
representatives has only twice exercised its conditional [[privilege]] of
deciding in cases of uncertainty; the first [[time]] was at the election of
mr. jefferson in 1801; the second was in 1825, when mr. quincy adams was
named. *z

[footnote z: [general grant is now (1874) the eighteenth president of
the [[united]] states.]]

crises of the election

the election may be considered as a national crisis--why?--passions of
the people--anxiety of the president--calm which succeeds the agitation
of the election.

i have shown what the circumstances are which favored the adoption of
the elective [[system]] in the [[united]] states, and what precautions were
taken by the legislators to obviate its dangers. the americans are
habitually accustomed to all kinds [[kind]] of elections, and they [[know]] by
experience the utmost [[degree]] of excitement which is compatible with
security. the vast extent of the [[country]] and the dissemination of the
inhabitants render a collision between parties less probable and less
dangerous there than elsewhere. the [[political]] circumstances under which
the elections have hitherto been carried on have presented no real
embarrassments to the nation.

nevertheless, the epoch of the election of a president of the united
states may be considered as a crisis in the affairs of the nation. the
influence which he exercises on [[public]] [[business]] is no [[doubt]] feeble and
indirect; but the [[choice]] of the president, which is of small importance
to each [[individual]] citizen, concerns the [[citizens]] collectively; and
however trifling an interest may be, it assumes a [[great]] [[degree]] of
importance as soon as it becomes general. the president possesses but
few means of rewarding his supporters in comparison to the kings [[king]] of
europe, but the places which are at his disposal are sufficiently
numerous to interest, directly or indirectly, several thousand electors
in his [[success]]. [[political]] parties in the [[united]] states are [[led]] to rally
round an [[individual]], in order to acquire a more tangible shape in the
eyes of the crowd, and the name of the candidate for the presidency is
put forward as the symbol and personification of their theories. for
these reasons [[reason]] parties are strongly interested in gaining the election,
not so much with a view to the triumph of their principles [[principle]] under
the auspices of the president-elect as to show by the majority which
returned him, the [[strength]] of the supporters of those principles [[principle]].

for a long while before the appointed [[time]] is at hand the election
becomes the most important and the all-engrossing topic of discussion.
the ardor of faction is redoubled; and all the artificial [[passions]] which
the [[imagination]] can create in the bosom of a [[happy]] and peaceful land
are agitated and brought to [[light]]. the president, on the other hand,
is absorbed by the cares [[care]] of self-defence. he no longer governs for the
interest of the [[state]], but for that of his re-election; he does homage
to the majority, and instead of checking its [[passions]], as his duty
commands him to do, he frequently courts its worst caprices. as the
election draws near, the activity of intrigue and the agitation of the
populace increase; the [[citizens]] are divided into hostile camps, each of
which assumes the name of its favorite candidate; the whole nation glows
with feverish excitement; the election is the daily theme of the public
papers, the [[subject]] of private conversation, the end of every thought
and every action, the sole interest of the [[present]]. as soon as the
choice is determined, this ardor is dispelled; and as a calmer season
returns, the current of the [[state]], which had nearly broken its banks,
sinks to its usual level: *a but who can refrain from astonishment at
the causes of the storm.

signal of civil [[war]].--translator's note.]]




chapter viii: the federal constitution--part iii

re-election of the president

when the head of the executive [[power]] is re-eligible, it is the state
which is the source of intrigue and corruption--the [[desire]] of
being re-elected the [[chief]] aim of a president of the united
states--disadvantage of the [[system]] peculiar to america--the natural
evil of [[democracy]] is that it subordinates all [[authority]] to the slightest
desires of the majority--the re-election of the president encourages
this [[evil]].

it may be [[asked]] whether the legislators of the [[united]] states did right
or [[wrong]] in allowing the re-election of the president. it seems at first
sight contrary to all [[reason]] to prevent the head of the executive power
from being elected a second [[time]]. the influence which the [[talents]] and
the [[character]] of a [[single]] [[individual]] may exercise upon the [[fate]] of a
whole [[people]], in critical circumstances or arduous times [[time]], is well known:
a [[law]] preventing the re-election of the [[chief]] magistrate would deprive
the [[citizens]] of the surest pledge of the [[prosperity]] and the security
of the commonwealth; and, by a singular inconsistency, a [[man]] would be
excluded from the [[government]] at the very [[time]] when he had shown his
ability in conducting its affairs.

but if these arguments are [[strong]], perhaps still more powerful reasons
may be advanced against them. intrigue and [[corruption]] are the natural
defects of elective [[government]]; but when the head of the [[state]] can be
re-elected these evils [[evil]] rise to a [[great]] height, and compromise the very
existence of the [[country]]. when a simple candidate seeks to rise by
intrigue, his manoeuvres must necessarily be limited to a narrow sphere;
but when the [[chief]] magistrate enters the lists, he borrows the strength
of the [[government]] for his own purposes [[purpose]]. in the former case the feeble
resources of an [[individual]] are in action; in the latter, the state
itself, with all its immense influence, is busied in the [[work]] of
corruption and cabal. the private citizen, who employs the most
immoral practices to acquire [[power]], can only act in a manner indirectly
prejudicial to the [[public]] [[prosperity]]. but if the representative of the
executive descends into the combat, the cares [[care]] of [[government]] dwindle into
second-rate importance, and the [[success]] of his election is his first
concern. all laws [[law]] and all the negotiations he undertakes are to him
nothing more than electioneering schemes; places become the reward
of services rendered, not to the nation, but to its [[chief]]; and the
influence of the [[government]], if not injurious to the [[country]], is at
least no longer beneficial to the [[community]] for which it was created.

it is impossible to consider the ordinary course of affairs in the
united states without perceiving that the [[desire]] of being re-elected is
the [[chief]] aim of the president; that his whole administration, and even
his most indifferent measures, tend to this object; and that, as the
crisis approaches, his personal interest takes the place of his interest
in the [[public]] [[good]]. the [[principle]] of re-eligibility renders the corrupt
influence of elective [[government]] still more extensive and pernicious.

in [[america]] it exercises a peculiarly fatal influence on the sources of
national existence. every [[government]] seems to be afflicted by some evil
which is inherent in its [[nature]], and the genius of the legislator is
shown in eluding its attacks. a [[state]] may survive the influence of a
host of [[bad]] laws [[law]], and the mischief they cause is frequently exaggerated;
but a [[law]] which encourages the [[growth]] of the canker within must prove
fatal in the end, although its [[bad]] consequences may not be immediately
perceived.

the [[principle]] of destruction in absolute monarchies [[monarchy]] lies [[lie]] in the
excessive and unreasonable extension of the prerogative of the [[crown]];
and a measure tending to remove the constitutional provisions which
counterbalance this influence would be radically [[bad]], even if its
immediate consequences were unattended with [[evil]]. by a parity of
reasoning, in countries [[country]] governed by a [[democracy]], where the [[people]] is
perpetually drawing all [[authority]] to itself, the laws [[law]] which increase or
accelerate its action are the direct assailants of the very [[principle]] of
the [[government]].

the [[greatest]] proof of the ability of the american legislators is, that
they clearly discerned this [[truth]], and that they had the [[courage]] to act
up to it. they conceived that a [[certain]] [[authority]] above the [[body]] of
the [[people]] was necessary, which should enjoy a [[degree]] of independence,
without, however, being entirely beyond the popular control;
an [[authority]] which would be forced to comply with the permanent
determinations of the majority, but which would be able to resist its
caprices, and to refuse its most dangerous demands. to this end they
centred the whole executive [[power]] of the nation in a [[single]] arm; they
granted extensive prerogatives to the president, and they armed him with
the veto to resist the encroachments of the legislature.

but by introducing the [[principle]] of re-election they partly destroyed
their [[work]]; and they rendered the president but little inclined to exert
the [[great]] [[power]] they had vested in his hands. if ineligible a second
time, the president would be far from independent of the [[people]], for his
responsibility would not be lessened; but the favor of the [[people]] would
not be so necessary to him as to induce him to court it by humoring its
desires. if re-eligible (and this is more especially true at the present
day, when [[political]] morality is relaxed, and when [[great]] [[men]] are rare),
the president of the [[united]] states becomes an easy tool in the hands of
the majority. he adopts its likings and its animosities, he hastens to
anticipate its wishes [[wish]], he forestalls its complaints, he yields to its
idlest cravings, and instead of guiding it, as the legislature intended
that he should do, he is ever ready to [[follow]] its bidding. thus, in
order not to deprive the [[state]] of the [[talents]] of an [[individual]], those
talents have been rendered almost useless; and to reserve an expedient
for extraordinary perils, the [[country]] has been exposed to daily dangers.

federal courts *b

political importance of the judiciary in the [[united]] states--difficulty
of treating this subject--utility of judicial [[power]] in
confederations--what tribunals could be introduced into the
union--necessity of establishing federal courts of justice--organization
of the national judiciary--the supreme court--in what it differs from
all known tribunals.

i have inquired into the legislative and executive [[power]] of the union,
and the judicial [[power]] now remains to be examined; but in this place
i cannot conceal my fears [[fear]] from the reader. their judicial institutions
exercise a [[great]] influence on the condition of the anglo-americans, and
they occupy a prominent place amongst what are probably called political
institutions: in this [[respect]] they are peculiarly deserving of our
attention. but i am at a loss to explain the [[political]] action of the
american tribunals without entering into some technical details of
their [[constitution]] and their forms of proceeding; and i [[know]] not how to
descend to these minutiae without wearying the curiosity of the reader
by the [[natural]] aridity of the [[subject]], or without risking to fall into
obscurity through a [[desire]] to be succinct. i can scarcely [[hope]] to escape
these various evils [[evil]]; for if i appear too lengthy to a [[man]] of the [[world]],
a lawyer may on the other hand [[complain]] of my brevity. but these are the
natural disadvantages of my [[subject]], and more especially of the point
which i am about to discuss.

the [[great]] difficulty was, not to devise the [[constitution]] to the federal
government, but to find out a method of enforcing its laws [[law]]. governments
have in general but two means of overcoming the opposition of the people
they govern, viz., the physical [[force]] which is at their own disposal,
and the [[moral]] [[force]] which they derive from the decisions of the courts
of [[justice]].

a [[government]] which should have no other means of exacting [[obedience]] than
open [[war]] must be very near its ruin, for one of two alternatives would
then probably occur: if its [[authority]] was small and its character
temperate, it would not resort to [[violence]] till the [[last]] extremity,
and it would connive at a number of partial acts of insubordination,
in which case the [[state]] would gradually fall into [[anarchy]]; if it was
enterprising and powerful, it would perpetually have recourse to
its physical [[strength]], and would speedily degenerate into a military
despotism. so that its activity would not be less prejudicial to the
community than its inaction.

the [[great]] end of [[justice]] is to substitute the notion of [[right]] for that
of [[violence]], and to place a legal barrier between the [[power]] of the
government and the use of physical [[force]]. the [[authority]] which is awarded
to the intervention of a court of [[justice]] by the general [[opinion]] of
mankind is so surprisingly [[great]] that it clings to the mere formalities
of [[justice]], and gives a bodily influence to the shadow of the [[law]]. the
moral [[force]] which courts of [[justice]] possess renders the introduction of
physical [[force]] exceedingly rare, and is very frequently substituted for
it; but if the latter proves to be indispensable, its [[power]] is doubled
by the association of the [[idea]] of [[law]].

a federal [[government]] stands in greater need of the support of judicial
institutions than any other, because it is naturally [[weak]] and exposed
to formidable opposition. *c if it were always obliged to resort to
violence in the first instance, it could not fulfil its task. the union,
therefore, required a national judiciary to enforce the [[obedience]] of the
citizens to the laws [[law]], and to repeal the attacks which might be directed
against them. the [[question]] then remained as to what tribunals were to
exercise these privileges [[privilege]]; were they to be entrusted to the courts of
justice which were already organized in every [[state]]? or was it necessary
to create federal courts? it may easily be proved that the union could
not adapt the judicial [[power]] of the states to its wants. the separation
of the judiciary from the administrative [[power]] of the [[state]] no doubt
affects the security of every citizen and the [[liberty]] of all. but it
is no less important to the existence of the nation that these several
powers should have the same origin, should [[follow]] the same principles [[principle]],
and act in the same sphere; in a word, that they should be correlative
and homogeneous. no one, i presume, ever suggested the advantage of
trying offences committed in [[france]] by a [[foreign]] court of [[justice]], in
order to secure the impartiality of the judges [[judge]]. the americans form one
people in relation to their federal [[government]]; but in the bosom of this
people divers [[political]] bodies [[body]] have been allowed to subsist which are
dependent on the national [[government]] in a few points, and independent
in all the rest; which have all a distinct origin, maxims [[maxim]] peculiar to
themselves, and special means of carrying on their affairs. to entrust
the execution of the laws [[law]] of the union to tribunals instituted by these
political bodies [[body]] would be to allow [[foreign]] judges [[judge]] to preside over the
nation. nay, more; not only is each [[state]] [[foreign]] to the union at
large, but it is in perpetual opposition to the [[common]] interests, since
whatever [[authority]] the union loses turns to the advantage of the states.
thus to enforce the laws [[law]] of the union by means of the tribunals of the
states would be to allow not only [[foreign]] but partial judges [[judge]] to preside
over the nation.

[footnote c: federal laws [[law]] are those which most require courts of
justice, and those at the same [[time]] which have most rarely established
them. the [[reason]] is that confederations have usually been formed by
independent states, which entertained no real intention of obeying the
central [[government]], and which very readily ceded the [[right]] of command
to the federal executive, and very prudently reserved the [[right]] of
non-compliance to themselves.]

but the number, still more than the mere [[character]], of the tribunals of
the states rendered them unfit for the service of the nation. when the
federal [[constitution]] was formed there were already thirteen courts of
justice in the [[united]] states which decided causes without appeal. that
number is now increased to twenty-four. to suppose that a [[state]] can
subsist when its fundamental laws [[law]] may be subjected to four-and-twenty
different interpretations at the same [[time]] is to advance a proposition
alike contrary to [[reason]] and to [[experience]].

the american legislators therefore agreed to create a federal judiciary
power to apply the laws [[law]] of the union, and to determine [[certain]] questions
affecting general interests, which were carefully determined beforehand.
the entire judicial [[power]] of the union was centred in one tribunal,
which was denominated the supreme court of the [[united]] states. but, to
facilitate the expedition of [[business]], inferior courts were appended to
it, which were empowered to decide causes of small importance without
appeal, and with appeal causes of more magnitude. the members of the
supreme court are named neither by the [[people]] nor the legislature, but
by the president of the [[united]] states, acting with the [[advice]] of the
senate. in order to render them independent of the other authorities [[authority]],
their office was made inalienable; and it was determined that their
salary, when once fixed, should not be altered by the legislature. *d
it was easy to proclaim the [[principle]] of a federal judiciary, but
difficulties multiplied when the extent of its jurisdiction was to be
determined.

[footnote d: the union was divided into districts, in each of which a
resident federal [[judge]] was appointed, and the court in which he presided
was termed a "district court." each of the judges [[judge]] of the supreme court
annually visits a [[certain]] portion of the [[republic]], in order to try the
most important causes upon the spot; the court presided over by this
magistrate is styled a "circuit court." lastly, all the most serious
cases of litigation are brought before the supreme court, which holds
a solemn session once a year, at which all the judges [[judge]] of the circuit
courts must attend. the jury was introduced into the federal courts
in the same manner, and in the same cases, as into the courts of the
states.

it will be observed that no analogy exists between the supreme court
of the [[united]] states and the french cour de cassation, since the latter
only hears appeals on questions [[question]] of [[law]]. the supreme court decides upon
the evidence of the [[fact]] as well as upon the [[law]] of the case, whereas
the cour de cassation does not pronounce a decision of its own, but
refers the cause to the arbitration of another tribunal. see the [[law]] of
september 24, 1789, "laws of the [[united]] states," by story, vol. i. p.
53.]

means of determining the jurisdiction of the federal courts difficulty
of determining the jurisdiction of separate courts of [[justice]] in
confederations--the courts of the union obtained the [[right]] of fixing
their own jurisdiction--in what [[respect]] this [[rule]] attacks the portion
of sovereignty reserved to the several states--the sovereignty of
these states restricted by the laws [[law]], and the interpretation of the
laws--consequently, the danger of the several states is more apparent
than real.

as the [[constitution]] of the [[united]] states recognized two distinct powers
in presence of each other, represented in a judicial point of view by
two distinct classes of courts of [[justice]], the utmost [[care]] which could
be taken in defining their separate jurisdictions would have been
insufficient to prevent frequent collisions between those tribunals. the
question then arose to whom the [[right]] of deciding the competency of each
court was to be referred.

in nations which constitute a [[single]] [[body]] [[politic]], when a [[question]] is
debated between two courts relating to their mutual jurisdiction, a
third tribunal is generally within reach to decide the difference;
and this is effected without difficulty, because in these nations the
questions of judicial competency have no connection with the privileges
of the national [[supremacy]]. but it was impossible to create an arbiter
between a superior court of the union and the superior court of a
separate [[state]] which would not belong to one of these two classes. it
was, therefore, necessary to allow one of these courts to [[judge]] its
own cause, and to take or to retain cognizance of the point which was
contested. to grant this [[privilege]] to the different courts of the states
would have been to [[destroy]] the sovereignty of the union de facto
after having established it de jure; for the interpretation of the
constitution would soon have restored that portion of independence to
the states of which the terms of that act deprived them. the object
of the creation of a federal tribunal was to prevent the courts of the
states from deciding questions [[question]] affecting the national interests in their
own department, and so to form a uniform [[body]] of jurisprudene for the
interpretation of the laws [[law]] of the union. this end would not have been
accomplished if the courts of the several states had been competent
to decide upon cases in their separate capacities from which they were
obliged to abstain as federal tribunals. the supreme court of the
united states was therefore invested with the [[right]] of determining all
questions of jurisdiction. *e

[footnote e: in order to diminish the number of these suits, it was
decided that in a [[great]] many federal causes the courts of the states
should be empowered to decide conjointly with those of the union, the
losing party having then a [[right]] of appeal to the supreme court of the
united states. the supreme court of virginia contested the [[right]] of
the supreme court of the [[united]] states to [[judge]] an appeal from its
decisions, but unsuccessfully. see "kent's commentaries," vol. i. p.
300, pp. 370 et seq.; story's "commentaries," p. 646; and "the organic
law of the [[united]] states," vol. i. p. 35.]

this was a severe blow upon the independence of the states, which was
thus restricted not only by the laws [[law]], but by the interpretation of them;
by one limit which was known, and by another which was dubious; by a
rule which was [[certain]], and a [[rule]] which was arbitrary. it is true the
constitution had laid down the precise limits of the federal [[supremacy]],
but whenever this [[supremacy]] is contested by one of the states, a federal
tribunal decides the [[question]]. nevertheless, the dangers with which the
independence of the states was threatened by this mode of proceeding are
less serious than they appeared to be. we shall see hereafter that in
america the real [[strength]] of the [[country]] is vested in the provincial far
more than in the federal [[government]]. the federal judges [[judge]] are conscious of
the relative weakness of the [[power]] in whose name they act, and they are
more inclined to abandon a [[right]] of jurisdiction in cases where it is
justly their own than to assert a [[privilege]] to which they have no legal
claim.

different cases of jurisdiction

the matter and the party are the first conditions of the federal
jurisdiction--suits in which ambassadors are engaged--suits of the
union--of a separate state--by whom tried--causes resulting from the
laws of the union--why judged by the federal tribunals--causes relating
to the performance of contracts tried by the federal courts--consequence
of this arrangement.

after having appointed the means of fixing the competency of the federal
courts, the legislators of the union defined the cases which should come
within their jurisdiction. it was established, on the one hand, that
certain parties must always be brought before the federal courts,
without any regard to the special [[nature]] of the cause; and, on the
other, that [[certain]] causes must always be brought before the same
courts, without any regard to the quality of the parties in the suit.
these distinctions were therefore admitted to be the basis of the
federal jurisdiction.

ambassadors are the representatives of nations in a [[state]] of amity
with the union, and whatever concerns these personages concerns in some
degree the whole union. when an ambassador is a party in a suit, that
suit affects the welfare of the nation, and a federal tribunal is
naturally called upon to decide it.

the union itself may be invoked in legal proceedings, and in this case
it would be alike contrary to the customs of all nations and to common
sense to appeal to a tribunal representing any other sovereignty
than its own; the federal courts, therefore, take cognizance of these
affairs.

when two parties belonging to two different states are engaged in a
suit, the case cannot with propriety be brought before a court of either
state. the surest expedient is to select a tribunal like that of the
union, which can excite the suspicions of neither party, and which
offers the most [[natural]] as well as the most [[certain]] remedy.

when the two parties are not private individuals [[individual]], but states, an
important [[political]] consideration is added to the same motive of equity.
the quality of the parties in this case gives a national importance to
all their disputes; and the most trifling litigation of the states may
be said to involve the [[peace]] of the whole union. *f

[footnote f: the [[constitution]] also says that the federal courts shall
decide "controversies between a [[state]] and the [[citizens]] of another
state." and here a most important [[question]] of a constitutional nature
arose, which was, whether the jurisdiction given by the [[constitution]] in
cases in which a [[state]] is a party extended to suits brought against a
state as well as by it, or was exclusively confined to the latter. the
question was most elaborately considered in the case of chisholm v.
georgia, and was decided by the majority of the supreme court in the
affirmative. the decision created general alarm among the states, and
an amendment was proposed and ratified by which the [[power]] was entirely
taken away, so far as it regards suits brought against a [[state]]. see
story's "commentaries," p. 624, or in the large edition section 1677.]


the [[nature]] of the cause frequently prescribes the [[rule]] of competency.
thus all the questions [[question]] which concern maritime commerce evidently fall
under the cognizance of the federal tribunals. *g almost all these
questions are connected with the interpretation of the [[law]] of nations,
and in this [[respect]] they essentially interest the union in relation to
foreign powers [[power]]. moreover, as the sea is not included within the limits
of any peculiar jurisdiction, the national courts can only hear causes
which originate in maritime affairs.

[footnote g: as for instance, all cases of piracy.]

the [[constitution]] comprises under one head almost all the cases which by
their very [[nature]] come within the limits of the federal courts. the
rule which it lays down is simple, but pregnant with an entire [[system]] of
ideas, and with a vast multitude of facts [[fact]]. it declares that the judicial
power of the supreme court shall extend to all cases in [[law]] and equity
arising under the laws [[law]] of the [[united]] states.

two examples [[example]] will put the intention of the legislator in the clearest
light:

the [[constitution]] prohibits the states from making laws [[law]] on the value
and circulation of [[money]]: if, notwithstanding this prohibition, a state
passes a [[law]] of this [[kind]], with which the interested parties refuse to
comply because it is contrary to the [[constitution]], the case must come
before a federal court, because it arises under the laws [[law]] of the united
states. again, if difficulties arise in the levying of import duties
which have been voted by congress, the federal court must decide the
case, because it arises under the interpretation of a [[law]] of the united
states.

this [[rule]] is in [[perfect]] accordance with the fundamental principles [[principle]] of
the federal [[constitution]]. the union, as it was established in 1789,
possesses, it is true, a limited [[supremacy]]; but it was intended that
within its limits it should form one and the same [[people]]. *h within
those limits the union is [[sovereign]]. when this point is established
and admitted, the inference is easy; for if it be acknowledged that
the [[united]] states constitute one and the same [[people]] within the bounds
prescribed by their [[constitution]], it is impossible to refuse them the
rights which belong to other nations. but it has been allowed, from the
origin of [[society]], that every nation has the [[right]] of deciding by its
own courts those questions [[question]] which concern the execution of its own laws [[law]].
to this it is answered that the union is in so singular a position
that in relation to some matters it constitutes a [[people]], and that in
relation to all the rest it is a nonentity. but the inference to be
drawn is, that in the laws [[law]] relating to these matters the union possesses
all the rights [[right]] of absolute sovereignty. the difficulty is to [[know]] what
these matters are; and when once it is resolved (and we have shown
how it was resolved, in speaking of the means of determining the
jurisdiction of the federal courts) no further [[doubt]] can arise; for as
soon as it is established that a suit is federal--that is to say, that
it belongs to the share of sovereignty reserved by the [[constitution]] of
the union--the [[natural]] consequence is that it should come within the
jurisdiction of a federal court.

[footnote h: this [[principle]] was in some measure restricted by the
introduction of the several states as independent powers [[power]] into the
senate, and by allowing them to vote separately in the house of
representatives when the president is elected by that [[body]]. but these
are exceptions, and the contrary [[principle]] is the [[rule]].]

whenever the laws [[law]] of the [[united]] states are attacked, or whenever they
are resorted to in self-defence, the federal courts must be appealed to.
thus the jurisdiction of the tribunals of the union extends and narrows
its limits exactly in the same ratio as the sovereignty of the union
augments or decreases. we have shown that the principal aim of the
legislators of 1789 was to divide the [[sovereign]] [[authority]] into two
parts. in the one they placed the control of all the general interests
of the union, in the other the control of the special interests of
its component states. their [[chief]] solicitude was to arm the federal
government with sufficient [[power]] to enable it to resist, within
its sphere, the encroachments of the several states. as for these
communities, the [[principle]] of independence within [[certain]] limits of
their own was adopted in their behalf; and they were concealed from the
inspection, and protected from the control, of the central [[government]].
in speaking of the division of [[authority]], i observed that this latter
principle had not always been held [[sacred]], since the states are
prevented from passing [[certain]] laws [[law]] which apparently belong to their own
particular sphere of interest. when a [[state]] of the union passes a [[law]] of
this [[kind]], the [[citizens]] who are injured by its execution can appeal to
the federal courts.

thus the jurisdiction of the federal courts extends not only to all the
cases which arise under the laws [[law]] of the union, but also to those
which arise under laws [[law]] made by the several states in opposition to the
constitution. the states are prohibited from making ex post facto laws
in [[criminal]] cases, and any [[person]] condemned by [[virtue]] of a [[law]] of this
kind can appeal to the judicial [[power]] of the union. the states are
likewise prohibited from making laws [[law]] which may have a tendency to impair
the obligations of contracts. *i if a citizen thinks [[think]] that an obligation
of this [[kind]] is impaired by a [[law]] passed in his [[state]], he may refuse to
obey it, and may appeal to the federal courts. *j

[footnote i: it is perfectly clear, says mr. story ("commentaries," p.
503, or in the large edition section 1379), that any [[law]] which enlarges,
abridges, or in any manner changes [[change]] the intention of the parties,
resulting from the stipulations in the contract, necessarily impairs it.
he gives in the same place a very long and careful definition of what is
understood by a contract in federal jurisprudence. a grant made by the
state to a private [[individual]], and accepted by him, is a contract, and
cannot be revoked by any future [[law]]. a charter granted by the [[state]] to
a company is a contract, and equally binding to the [[state]] as to the
grantee. the clause of the [[constitution]] here referred to insures,
therefore, the existence of a [[great]] part of acquired rights [[right]], but not of
all. [[property]] may legally be held, though it may not have passed into
the possessor's hands by means of a contract; and its possession is an
acquired [[right]], not guaranteed by the federal [[constitution]].]

[footnote j: a remarkable instance of this is given by mr. story (p.
508, or in the large edition section 1388): "dartmouth college in new
hampshire had been founded by a charter granted to [[certain]] individuals
before the american [[revolution]], and its trustees formed a corporation
under this charter. the legislature of new hampshire had, without the
consent of this corporation, passed an act changing the organization of
the original provincial charter of the college, and transferring all the
rights, privileges [[privilege]], and franchises from the old charter trustees to new
trustees appointed under the act. the constitutionality of the act was
contested, and, after solemn arguments, it was deliberately held by
the supreme court that the provincial charter was a contract within
the meaning of the [[constitution]] (art. i. section 10), and that the
emendatory act was utterly void, as impairing the obligation of
that charter. the college was deemed, like other colleges of private
foundation, to be a private eleemosynary institution, endowed by
its charter with a capacity to take [[property]] unconnected with the
government. its funds were bestowed upon the [[faith]] of the charter, and
those funds consisted entirely of private donations. it is true that the
uses were in some sense [[public]], that is, for the general benefit, and
not for the mere benefit of the corporators; but this did not make
the corporation a [[public]] corporation. it was a private institution for
general charity. it was not distinguishable in [[principle]] from a private
donation, vested in private trustees, for a [[public]] charity, or for
a particular [[purpose]] of beneficence. and the [[state]] itself, if it had
bestowed funds upon a charity of the same [[nature]], could not resume those
funds."]

this provision appears to me to be the most serious attack upon the
independence of the states. the rights [[right]] awarded to the federal government
for purposes [[purpose]] of obvious national importance are definite and easily
comprehensible; but those with which this [[last]] clause invests it are
not either clearly appreciable or accurately defined. for there are vast
numbers of [[political]] laws [[law]] which influence the existence of obligations
of contracts, which may thus furnish an easy pretext for the aggressions
of the central [[authority]].




chapter viii: the federal constitution--part iv

procedure of the federal courts

natural weakness of the judiciary [[power]] in confederations--legislators
ought to strive as much as possible to bring private individuals [[individual]], and
not states, before the federal courts--how the americans have succeeded
in this--direct prosecution of private individuals [[individual]] in the federal
courts--indirect prosecution of the states which violate the laws [[law]] of the
union--the decrees of the supreme court enervate but do not [[destroy]] the
provincial laws [[law]].

i have shown what the privileges [[privilege]] of the federal courts are, and it is no
less important to point out the manner in which they are exercised. the
irresistible [[authority]] of [[justice]] in countries [[country]] in which the sovereignty
in undivided is derived from the [[fact]] that the tribunals of those
countries represent the entire nation at issue with the individual
against whom their decree is directed, and the [[idea]] of [[power]] is thus
introduced to corroborate the [[idea]] of [[right]]. but this is not always
the case in countries [[country]] in which the sovereignty is divided; in them the
judicial [[power]] is more frequently opposed to a fraction of the nation
than to an isolated [[individual]], and its [[moral]] [[authority]] and physical
strength are consequently diminished. in federal states the [[power]] of
the [[judge]] is naturally decreased, and that of the justiciable parties
is augmented. the aim of the legislator in confederate states ought
therefore to be to render the position of the courts of justice
analogous to that which they occupy in countries [[country]] where the sovereignty
is undivided; in other words, his efforts ought constantly to tend to
maintain the judicial [[power]] of the confederation as the representative
of the nation, and the justiciable party as the representative of an
individual interest.

every [[government]], whatever may be its [[constitution]], requires the means
of constraining its subjects [[subject]] to discharge their obligations, and of
protecting its privileges [[privilege]] from their assaults. as far as the direct
action of the [[government]] on the [[community]] is concerned, the constitution
of the [[united]] states contrived, by a master-stroke of policy, that
the federal courts, acting in the name of the laws [[law]], should only take
cognizance of parties in an [[individual]] capacity. for, as it had been
declared that the union consisted of one and the same [[people]] within
the limits laid down by the [[constitution]], the inference was that the
government created by this [[constitution]], and acting within these limits,
was invested with all the privileges [[privilege]] of a national [[government]], one of
the principal of which is the [[right]] of transmitting its injunctions
directly to the private citizen. when, for instance, the union votes an
impost, it does not apply to the states for the levying of it, but to
every american citizen in proportion to his assessment. the supreme
court, which is empowered to enforce the execution of this [[law]] of the
union, exerts its influence not upon a refractory [[state]], but upon the
private taxpayer; and, like the judicial [[power]] of other nations, it is
opposed to the [[person]] of an [[individual]]. it is to be observed that the
union chose its own antagonist; and as that antagonist is feeble, he is
naturally worsted.


but the difficulty increases when the proceedings are not brought
forward by but against the union. the [[constitution]] recognizes the
legislative [[power]] of the states; and a [[law]] so enacted may impair the
privileges of the union, in which case a collision in unavoidable
between that [[body]] and the [[state]] which has passed the [[law]]: and it only
remains to select the least dangerous remedy, which is very clearly
deducible from the general principles [[principle]] i have before established. *k

[footnote k: see [[chapter]] vi. on "judicial [[power]] in [[america]]."]

it may be conceived that, in the case under consideration, the union
might have used the [[state]] before a federal court, which would have
annulled the act, and by this means it would have adopted a natural
course of proceeding; but the judicial [[power]] would have been placed
in open hostility to the [[state]], and it was desirable to avoid this
predicament as much as possible. the americans hold that it is nearly
impossible that a new [[law]] should not impair the interests of some
private [[individual]] by its provisions: these private interests are
assumed by the american legislators as the ground of attack against such
measures as may be prejudicial to the union, and it is to these cases
that the protection of the supreme court is extended.

suppose a [[state]] vends a [[certain]] portion of its territory to a company,
and that a year afterwards it passes a [[law]] by which the territory
is otherwise disposed of, and that clause of the [[constitution]] which
prohibits laws [[law]] impairing the obligation of contracts violated. when the
purchaser under the second act appears to take possession, the possessor
under the first act brings his action before the tribunals of the union,
and causes the title of the claimant to be pronounced null and void. *l
thus, in point of [[fact]], the judicial [[power]] of the union is contesting
the claims of the sovereignty of a [[state]]; but it only acts indirectly
and upon a special application of detail: it attacks the [[law]] in its
consequences, not in its [[principle]], and it rather weakens than destroys
it.

[footnote l: see kent's "commentaries," vol. i. p. 387.]

the [[last]] hypothesis that remained was that each [[state]] formed a
corporation enjoying a separate existence and distinct civil rights [[right]], and
that it could therefore sue or be sued before a tribunal. thus a state
could bring an action against another [[state]]. in this instance the union
was not called upon to contest a provincial [[law]], but to try a suit in
which a [[state]] was a party. this suit was perfectly similar to any other
cause, except that the quality of the parties was different; and here
the danger pointed out at the beginning of this [[chapter]] exists with less
chance of being avoided. the inherent disadvantage of the very essence
of federal constitutions [[constitution]] is that they engender parties in the bosom
of the nation which [[present]] powerful obstacles to the [[free]] course of
justice.

high rank of the supreme court amongst the [[great]] powers [[power]] of state
no nation ever constituted so [[great]] a judicial [[power]] as the
americans--extent of its prerogative--its [[political]] influence--the
tranquillity and the very existence of the union depend on the
discretion of the seven federal judges [[judge]].

when we have successively examined in detail the organization of the
supreme court, and the entire prerogatives which it exercises, we shall
readily admit that a more imposing judicial [[power]] was never constituted
by any [[people]]. the supreme court is placed at the head of all known
tribunals, both by the [[nature]] of its rights [[right]] and the class of justiciable
parties which it controls.

in all the civilized countries [[country]] of [[europe]] the [[government]] has always shown
the [[greatest]] repugnance to allow the cases to which it was itself a
party to be decided by the ordinary course of [[justice]]. this repugnance
naturally attains its utmost height in an absolute [[government]]; and, on
the other hand, the privileges [[privilege]] of the courts of [[justice]] are extended
with the increasing liberties [[liberty]] of the [[people]]: but no [[european]] nation has
at [[present]] held that all judicial controversies, without regard to their
origin, can be decided by the judges [[judge]] of [[common]] [[law]].

in [[america]] this theory has been actually put in practice, and the
supreme court of the [[united]] states is the sole tribunal of the nation.
its [[power]] extends to all the cases arising under laws [[law]] and treaties made
by the executive and legislative authorities [[authority]], to all cases of admiralty
and maritime jurisdiction, and in general to all points which affect the
law of nations. it may even be affirmed that, although its constitution
is essentially judicial, its prerogatives are almost entirely [[political]].
its sole object is to enforce the execution of the laws [[law]] of the union;
and the union only regulates the relations of the [[government]] with
the [[citizens]], and of the nation with [[foreign]] powers [[power]]: the relations of
citizens amongst themselves are almost exclusively regulated by the
sovereignty of the states.

a second and still greater cause of the preponderance of this court
may be adduced. in the nations of [[europe]] the courts of [[justice]] are only
called upon to try the controversies of private individuals [[individual]]; but the
supreme court of the [[united]] states summons [[sovereign]] powers [[power]] to its bar.
when the clerk of the court advances on the steps of the tribunal, and
simply says, "the [[state]] of new york versus the [[state]] of ohio," it is
impossible not to [[feel]] that the court which he addresses is no ordinary
body; and when it is recollected that one of these parties represents
one million, and the other two millions of [[men]], one is struck by the
responsibility of the seven judges [[judge]] whose decision is about to satisfy or
to disappoint so large a number of their fellow-citizens.

the [[peace]], the [[prosperity]], and the very existence of the union
are vested in the hands of the seven judges [[judge]]. without their active
co-operation the [[constitution]] would be a [[dead]] letter: the executive
appeals to them for assistance against the encroachments of the
legislative powers [[power]]; the legislature demands their protection from the
designs of the executive; they defend the union from the disobedience
of the states, the states from the exaggerated claims of the union,
the [[public]] interest against the interests of private [[citizens]], and
the conservative spirit of order against the fleeting innovations of
democracy. their [[power]] is enormous, but it is clothed in the authority
of [[public]] [[opinion]]. they are the all-powerful guardians of a [[people]] which
respects [[law]], but they would be impotent against popular neglect or
popular contempt. the [[force]] of [[public]] [[opinion]] is the most intractable of
agents, because its exact limits cannot be defined; and it is not less
dangerous to exceed than to remain below the boundary prescribed.

the federal judges [[judge]] must not only be [[good]] [[citizens]], and [[men]] possessed of
that information and integrity which are indispensable to magistrates,
but they must be statesmen--politicians, not unread in the signs of the
times, not afraid to brave the obstacles which can be subdued, nor slow
to turn aside such encroaching elements as may threaten the [[supremacy]] of
the union and the [[obedience]] which is due to the laws [[law]].

the president, who exercises a limited [[power]], may err without causing
great mischief in the [[state]]. congress may decide amiss without
destroying the union, because the electoral [[body]] in which congress
originates may cause it to retract its decision by changing its members.
but if the supreme court is ever composed of imprudent [[men]] or bad
citizens, the union may be plunged into [[anarchy]] or civil [[war]].

the real cause of this danger, however, does not [[lie]] in the constitution
of the tribunal, but in the very [[nature]] of federal governments [[government]]. we
have observed that in confederate peoples [[people]] it is especially necessary to
consolidate the judicial [[authority]], because in no other nations do those
independent persons [[person]] who are able to cope with the social [[body]] [[exist]] in
greater [[power]] or in a [[better]] condition to resist the physical strength
of the [[government]]. but the more a [[power]] requires to be strengthened, the
more extensive and independent it must be made; and the dangers
which its [[abuse]] may create are heightened by its independence and its
strength. the source of the [[evil]] is not, therefore, in the constitution
of the [[power]], but in the [[constitution]] of those states which render its
existence necessary.

in what respects [[respect]] the federal [[constitution]] is superior to that of the
states

in what respects [[respect]] the [[constitution]] of the union can be compared to that
of the states--superiority of the [[constitution]] of the union attributable
to the [[wisdom]] of the federal legislators--legislature of the union less
dependent on the [[people]] than that of the states--executive power
more independent in its sphere--judicial [[power]] less subjected to the
inclinations of the majority--practical consequence of these facts--the
dangers inherent in a democratic [[government]] eluded by the federal
legislators, and increased by the legislators of the states.

the federal [[constitution]] differs essentially from that of the states in
the ends which it is intended to accomplish, but in the means by which
these ends are promoted a greater analogy exists between them. the
objects of the governments [[government]] are different, but their forms are the same;
and in this special point of view there is some advantage in comparing
them together.

i am of [[opinion]] that the federal [[constitution]] is superior to all the
constitutions of the states, for several reasons [[reason]].

the [[present]] [[constitution]] of the union was formed at a later period
than those of the majority of the states, and it may have derived some
ameliorations from [[past]] [[experience]]. but we shall be [[led]] to acknowledge
that this is only a secondary cause of its superiority, when we
recollect that eleven new states *n have been added to the american
confederation since the promulgation of the federal [[constitution]], and
that these new republics [[republic]] have always rather exaggerated than avoided the
defects which existed in the former constitutions [[constitution]].

[footnote n: [the number of states has now risen to 46 (1874), besides
the district of columbia.]]

the [[chief]] cause of the superiority of the federal [[constitution]] lay in
the [[character]] of the legislators who composed it. at the [[time]] when it
was formed the dangers of the confederation were imminent, and its ruin
seemed inevitable. in this extremity the [[people]] chose the [[men]] who most
deserved the esteem, rather than those who had gained the affections,
of the [[country]]. i have already observed that distinguished as almost
all the legislators of the union were for their [[intelligence]], they were
still more so for their [[patriotism]]. they had all been nurtured at a time
when the spirit of [[liberty]] was braced by a continual struggle against
a powerful and predominant [[authority]]. when the contest was terminated,
whilst the excited [[passions]] of the populace persisted in warring with
dangers which had ceased to threaten them, these [[men]] stopped short in
their [[career]]; they cast a calmer and more penetrating look upon
the [[country]] which was now their own; they perceived that the [[war]] of
independence was definitely ended, and that the only dangers which
america had to [[fear]] were those which might result from the [[abuse]] of the
freedom she had won. they had the [[courage]] to say what they believed
to be true, because they were animated by a warm and sincere [[love]] of
liberty; and they ventured to propose restrictions, because they were
resolutely opposed to destruction. *o

[footnote o: at this [[time]] alexander hamilton, who was one of the
principal founders of the [[constitution]], ventured to express the
following sentiments in "the federalist," no. 71:--


"there are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of
the executive to a prevailing current, either in the [[community]] or in
the legislature, as its [[best]] recommendation. but such [[men]] entertain
very crude notions, as well of the purposes [[purpose]] for which [[government]] was
instituted as of the true means by which the [[public]] [[happiness]] may be
promoted. the republican [[principle]] demands that the deliberative sense
of the [[community]] should govern the conduct of those to whom they entrust
the management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified
complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient
impulse which the [[people]] may receive from the [[arts]] of [[men]] who flatter
their prejudices to betray their interests. it is a just observation,
that the [[people]] commonly intend the [[public]] [[good]]. this often applies to
their very errors. but their [[good]] sense would despise the adulator
who should pretend that they always [[reason]] [[right]] about the means of
promoting it. they [[know]] from [[experience]] that they sometimes err; and the
wonder is that they so seldom err as they do, beset, as they continually
are, by the wiles of parasites and sycophants; by the snares of the
ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate; by the artifices of [[men]] who
possess their confidence more than they deserve it, and of those who
seek to possess rather than to deserve it. when occasions [[occasion]] present
themselves in which the interests of the [[people]] are at variance with
their inclinations, it is the [[duty]] of persons [[person]] whom they have appointed
to be the guardians of those interests to withstand the temporary
delusion, in order to give them [[time]] and opportunity for more cool and
sedate reflection. instances might be cited in which a conduct of this
kind has saved the [[people]] from very fatal consequences of their own
mistakes, and has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the
men who had [[courage]] and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of
their displeasure."]

the greater number of the constitutions [[constitution]] of the states assign one year
for the duration of the house of representatives, and two years for that
of the senate; so that members of the legislative [[body]] are constantly
and narrowly tied down by the slightest desires [[desire]] of their constituents.
the legislators of the union were of [[opinion]] that this excessive
dependence of the legislature tended to alter the [[nature]] of the main
consequences of the representative [[system]], since it vested the source,
not only of [[authority]], but of [[government]], in the [[people]]. they increased
the length of the [[time]] for which the representatives were returned, in
order to give them freer scope for the exercise of their own [[judgment]].

the federal [[constitution]], as well as the constitutions [[constitution]] of the different
states, divided the legislative [[body]] into two branches. but in the
states these two branches were composed of the same elements, and
elected in the same manner. the consequence was that the passions
and inclinations of the populace were as rapidly and as energetically
represented in one chamber as in the other, and that laws [[law]] were made with
all the characteristics of [[violence]] and precipitation. by the federal
constitution the two houses originate in like manner in the [[choice]] of
the [[people]]; but the conditions of eligibility and the mode of election
were changed, to the end that, if, as is the case in [[certain]] nations,
one branch of the legislature represents the same interests as the
other, it may at least represent a superior [[degree]] of intelligence
and discretion. a mature [[age]] was made one of the conditions of the
senatorial [[dignity]], and the upper house was chosen by an elected
assembly of a limited number of members.

to concentrate the whole social [[force]] in the hands of the legislative
body is the [[natural]] tendency of democracies [[democracy]]; for as this is the
power which emanates the most directly from the [[people]], it is made to
participate most fully in the preponderating [[authority]] of the multitude,
and it is naturally [[led]] to monopolize every [[species]] of influence. this
concentration is at once prejudicial to a well-conducted administration,
and favorable to the despotism of the majority. the legislators of the
states frequently yielded to these democratic propensities, which were
invariably and courageously resisted by the founders of the union.

in the states the executive [[power]] is vested in the hands of a
magistrate, who is apparently placed upon a level with the legislature,
but who is in reality nothing more than the blind agent and the passive
instrument of its decisions. he can derive no influence from the
duration of his functions, which terminate with the revolving year, or
from the exercise of prerogatives which can scarcely be said to [[exist]].
the legislature can condemn him to inaction by intrusting the execution
of the laws [[law]] to special committees of its own members, and can annul
his temporary [[dignity]] by depriving him of his salary. the federal
constitution vests all the privileges [[privilege]] and all the responsibility of the
executive [[power]] in a [[single]] [[individual]]. the duration of the presidency
is fixed at four years; the salary of the [[individual]] who fills that
office cannot be altered during the term of his functions; he is
protected by a [[body]] of official dependents, and armed with a suspensive
veto. in short, every effort was made to confer a [[strong]] and independent
position upon the executive [[authority]] within the limits which had been
prescribed to it.

in the constitutions [[constitution]] of all the states the judicial [[power]] is that which
remains the most independent of the legislative [[authority]]; nevertheless,
in all the states the legislature has reserved to itself the [[right]] of
regulating the emoluments of the judges [[judge]], a practice which necessarily
subjects these magistrates to its immediate influence. in some states
the judges [[judge]] are only temporarily appointed, which deprives them of
a [[great]] portion of their [[power]] and their [[freedom]]. in others the
legislative and judicial powers [[power]] are entirely confounded; thus the senate
of new york, for instance, constitutes in [[certain]] cases the superior
court of the [[state]]. the federal [[constitution]], on the other hand,
carefully separates the judicial [[authority]] from all external influences;
and it provides for the independence of the judges [[judge]], by declaring that
their salary shall not be altered, and that their functions shall be
inalienable.

the practical consequences of these different systems [[system]] may easily be
perceived. an attentive observer will soon remark that the [[business]] of
the union is incomparably [[better]] conducted than that of any individual
state. the conduct of the federal [[government]] is more [[fair]] and more
temperate than that of the states, its designs are more fraught with
wisdom, its projects are more durable and more skilfully combined, its
measures are put into execution with more vigor and consistency.

i recapitulate the substance of this [[chapter]] in a few words: the
existence of democracies [[democracy]] is threatened by two dangers, viz., the
complete subjection of the legislative [[body]] to the caprices of
the electoral [[body]], and the concentration of all the powers [[power]] of the
government in the legislative [[authority]]. the [[growth]] of these evils [[evil]] has
been encouraged by the policy of the legislators of the states, but it
has been resisted by the legislators of the union by every means which
lay within their control.

characteristics which distinguish the federal [[constitution]] of the united
states of [[america]] from all other federal constitutions [[constitution]] american union
appears to resemble all other confederations--nevertheless its effects
are different--reason of this--distinctions between the union and all
other confederations--the american [[government]] not a federal but an
imperfect national [[government]].

the [[united]] states of [[america]] do not afford either the first or the only
instance of confederate states, several of which have existed in modern
europe, without adverting to those of antiquity. switzerland, the
germanic [[empire]], and the [[republic]] of the [[united]] provinces either have
been or still are confederations. in studying the constitutions [[constitution]] of these
different countries [[country]], the politician is surprised to observe that the
powers with which they invested the federal [[government]] are nearly
identical with the privileges [[privilege]] awarded by the american [[constitution]] to
the [[government]] of the [[united]] states. they confer upon the central power
the same rights [[right]] of making [[peace]] and [[war]], of raising [[money]] and [[troops]],
and of providing for the general exigencies and the [[common]] interests
of the nation. nevertheless the federal [[government]] of these different
peoples has always been as remarkable for its weakness and inefficiency
as that of the union is for its vigorous and enterprising spirit. again,
the first american confederation perished through the excessive weakness
of its [[government]]; and this [[weak]] [[government]] was, notwithstanding, in
possession of rights [[right]] even more extensive than those of the federal
government of the [[present]] day. but the more recent [[constitution]] of
the [[united]] states contains [[certain]] principles [[principle]] which exercise a most
important influence, although they do not at once strike the observer.

this [[constitution]], which may at first sight be confounded with the
federal constitutions [[constitution]] which preceded it, rests upon a novel theory,
which may be considered as a [[great]] invention in [[modern]] political
science. in all the confederations which had been formed before the
american [[constitution]] of 1789 the allied states agreed to obey the
injunctions of a federal [[government]]; but they reserved to themselves the
right of ordaining and enforcing the execution of the laws [[law]] of the union.
the american states which combined in 1789 agreed that the federal
government should not only dictate the laws [[law]], but that it should execute
it own enactments. in both cases the [[right]] is the same, but the exercise
of the [[right]] is different; and this alteration produced the most
momentous consequences.

in all the confederations which had been formed before the american
union the federal [[government]] demanded its supplies at the hands of the
separate governments [[government]]; and if the measure it prescribed was onerous to
any one of those bodies [[body]] means were found to evade its claims: if the
state was powerful, it had recourse to arms; if it was [[weak]], it connived
at the [[resistance]] which the [[law]] of the union, its [[sovereign]], met with,
and resorted to inaction under the plea of inability. under these
circumstances one of the two alternatives has invariably occurred;
either the most preponderant of the allied peoples [[people]] has assumed the
privileges of the federal [[authority]] and ruled all the states in its
name, *p or the federal [[government]] has been abandoned by its natural
supporters, [[anarchy]] has arisen between the confederates, and the union
has lost all powers [[power]] of action. *q

[footnote p: this was the case in greece, when philip undertook to
execute the decree of the amphictyons; in the low countries [[country]], where the
province of holland always gave the [[law]]; and, in our own [[time]], in the
germanic confederation, in which austria and prussia assume a great
degree of influence over the whole [[country]], in the name of the diet.]

[footnote q: such has always been the situation of the swiss
confederation, which would have perished ages [[age]] ago but for the mutual
jealousies of its neighbors.]

in [[america]] the subjects [[subject]] of the union are not states, but private
citizens: the national [[government]] levies a tax, not upon the [[state]] of
massachusetts, but upon each inhabitant of massachusetts. all former
confederate governments [[government]] presided over communities [[community]], but that of the union
rules individuals [[individual]]; its [[force]] is not borrowed, but self-derived; and it
is served by its own civil and [[military]] officers, by its own [[army]], and
its own courts of [[justice]]. it cannot be doubted that the spirit of the
nation, the [[passions]] of the multitude, and the provincial prejudices
of each [[state]] tend singularly to diminish the [[authority]] of a federal
authority thus constituted, and to facilitate the means of [[resistance]] to
its mandates; but the comparative weakness of a restricted sovereignty
is an [[evil]] inherent in the federal [[system]]. in [[america]], each state
has fewer opportunities of [[resistance]] and fewer temptations to
non-compliance; nor can such a design be put in execution (if indeed it
be entertained) without an open violation of the laws [[law]] of the union,
a direct interruption of the ordinary course of [[justice]], and a bold
declaration of revolt; in a word, without taking a decisive step which
men hesitate to adopt.

in all former confederations the privileges [[privilege]] of the union furnished more
elements of discord than of [[power]], since they multiplied the claims
of the nation without augmenting the means of enforcing them: and in
accordance with this [[fact]] it may be remarked that the real weakness of
federal governments [[government]] has almost always been in the exact ratio of their
nominal [[power]]. such is not the case in the american union, in which,
as in ordinary governments [[government]], the federal [[government]] has the means of
enforcing all it is empowered to demand.

the [[human]] understanding more easily invents new things than new words,
and we are thence constrained to employ a multitude of improper and
inadequate expressions. when several nations form a permanent league
and establish a supreme [[authority]], which, although it has not the same
influence over the members of the [[community]] as a national [[government]],
acts upon each of the confederate states in a [[body]], this [[government]],
which is so essentially different from all others, is denominated a
federal one. another form of [[society]] is afterwards discovered, in which
several peoples [[people]] are fused into one and the same nation with regard to
certain [[common]] interests, although they remain distinct, or at least
only confederate, with regard to all their other concerns. in this case
the central [[power]] acts directly upon those whom it governs, whom it
rules, and whom it judges [[judge]], in the same manner, as, but in a more limited
circle than, a national [[government]]. here the term federal [[government]] is
clearly no longer applicable to a [[state]] of things which must be styled
an incomplete national [[government]]: a form of [[government]] has been found
out which is neither exactly national nor federal; but no further
progress has been made, and the new word which will one day designate
this novel invention does not yet [[exist]].

the absence of this new [[species]] of confederation has been the cause
which has brought all unions to civil [[war]], to subjection, or to a
stagnant apathy, and the peoples [[people]] which formed these leagues have been
either too dull to discern, or too pusillanimous to apply this great
remedy. the american confederation perished by the same defects.

but the confederate states of [[america]] had been long accustomed to form
a portion of one [[empire]] before they had won their independence; they
had not contracted the habit of governing themselves, and their national
prejudices had not taken deep root in their minds [[mind]]. superior to the rest
of the [[world]] in [[political]] [[knowledge]], and sharing that [[knowledge]] equally
amongst themselves, they were little agitated by the [[passions]] which
generally oppose the extension of federal [[authority]] in a nation, and
those [[passions]] were checked by the [[wisdom]] of the [[chief]] [[citizens]]. the
americans applied the remedy with prudent firmness as soon as they were
conscious of the [[evil]]; they amended their laws [[law]], and they saved their
country.




chapter viii: the federal constitution--part v

advantages of the federal [[system]] in general, and its special utility in
america.

happiness and [[freedom]] of small nations--power of [[great]] nations--great
empires favorable to the [[growth]] of civilization--strength often the
first element of national prosperity--aim of the federal [[system]] to
unite the twofold advantages resulting from a small and from a large
territory--advantages derived by the [[united]] states from this system--the
law adapts itself to the exigencies of the [[population]]; [[population]] does
not conform to the exigencies of the law--activity, amelioration, love
and enjoyment of [[freedom]] in the american communities--public spirit of
the union the abstract of provincial patriotism--principles and things
circulate freely over the territory of the [[united]] states--the union is
happy and [[free]] as a little nation, and respected as a [[great]] [[empire]].

in small nations the scrutiny of [[society]] penetrates into every part, and
the spirit of improvement enters into the most trifling details; as the
ambition of the [[people]] is necessarily checked by its weakness, all the
efforts and resources of the [[citizens]] are turned to the internal benefit
of the [[community]], and are not likely to evaporate in the fleeting
breath of [[glory]]. the desires [[desire]] of every [[individual]] are limited, because
extraordinary faculties are rarely to be met with. the gifts of an equal
fortune render the various conditions of [[life]] uniform, and the manners
of the inhabitants are orderly and simple. thus, if one estimate the
gradations of popular morality and enlightenment, we shall generally
find that in small nations there are more persons [[person]] in easy circumstances,
a more numerous [[population]], and a more tranquil [[state]] of [[society]], than
in [[great]] empires.

when [[tyranny]] is established in the bosom of a small nation, it is more
galling than elsewhere, because, as it acts within a narrow circle,
every point of that circle is [[subject]] to its direct influence. it
supplies the place of those [[great]] designs which it cannot entertain by
a [[violent]] or an exasperating interference in a multitude of minute
details; and it leaves the [[political]] [[world]], to which it properly
belongs, to meddle with the arrangements of domestic [[life]]. tastes as
well as actions are to be regulated at its [[pleasure]]; and the families [[family]] of
the [[citizens]] as well as the affairs of the [[state]] are to be governed by
its decisions. this [[invasion]] of rights [[right]] occurs, however, but seldom,
and [[freedom]] is in [[truth]] the [[natural]] [[state]] of small communities [[community]]. the
temptations which the [[government]] offers to [[ambition]] are too [[weak]], and
the resources of private individuals [[individual]] are too slender, for the sovereign
power easily to fall within the grasp of a [[single]] citizen; and should
such an event have occurred, the subjects [[subject]] of the [[state]] can without
difficulty overthrow the [[tyrant]] and his oppression by a simultaneous
effort.

small nations have therefore ever been the cradle of [[political]] [[liberty]];
and the [[fact]] that many of them have lost their immunities by extending
their dominion shows that the [[freedom]] they enjoyed was more a
consequence of the inferior size than of the [[character]] of the [[people]].

the [[history]] of the [[world]] affords no instance of a [[great]] nation retaining
the form of republican [[government]] for a long series of years, *r
and this has [[led]] to the conclusion that such a [[state]] of things is
impracticable. for my own part, i cannot but censure the imprudence of
attempting to limit the possible and to [[judge]] the future on the part of
a being who is hourly deceived by the most palpable realities of [[life]],
and who is constantly taken by surprise in the circumstances with which
he is most familiar. but it may be advanced with confidence that the
existence of a [[great]] [[republic]] will always be exposed to far greater
perils than that of a small one.

[footnote r: i do not speak of a confederation of small republics [[republic]], but
of a [[great]] consolidated [[republic]].]

all the [[passions]] which are most fatal to republican [[institutions]] spread
with an increasing territory, whilst the virtues [[virtue]] which maintain their
dignity do not augment in the same proportion. the [[ambition]] of the
citizens increases with the [[power]] of the [[state]]; the [[strength]] of parties
with the importance of the ends they have in view; but that devotion to
the [[common]] weal which is the surest check on destructive [[passions]] is
not stronger in a large than in a small [[republic]]. it might, indeed, be
proved without difficulty that it is less powerful and less sincere. the
arrogance of [[wealth]] and the dejection of wretchedness, [[capital]] cities [[city]] of
unwonted extent, a lax morality, a vulgar egotism, and a [[great]] confusion
of interests, are the dangers which almost invariably arise from the
magnitude of states. but several of these evils [[evil]] are scarcely prejudicial
to a [[monarchy]], and some of them contribute to maintain its existence.
in monarchical states the [[strength]] of the [[government]] is its own; it may
use, but it does not depend on, the [[community]], and the [[authority]] of the
prince is proportioned to the [[prosperity]] of the nation; but the only
security which a republican [[government]] possesses against these evils
lies in the support of the majority. this support is not, however,
proportionably greater in a large [[republic]] than it is in a small one;
and thus, whilst the means of attack perpetually increase both in number
and in influence, the [[power]] of [[resistance]] remains the same, or it may
rather be said to diminish, since the propensities and interests of
the [[people]] are diversified by the increase of the [[population]], and the
difficulty of forming a compact majority is constantly augmented. it
has been observed, moreover, that the intensity of [[human]] [[passions]] is
heightened, not only by the importance of the end which they propose to
attain, but by the multitude of individuals [[individual]] who are animated by them at
the same [[time]]. every one has had [[occasion]] to remark that his emotions
in the midst of a sympathizing crowd are far greater than those which he
would have [[felt]] in solitude. in [[great]] republics [[republic]] the impetus of political
passion is irresistible, not only because it aims at gigantic purposes [[purpose]],
but because it is [[felt]] and shared by millions of [[men]] at the same [[time]].

it may therefore be asserted as a general proposition that nothing is
more opposed to the well-being and the [[freedom]] of [[man]] than vast empires.
nevertheless it is important to acknowledge the peculiar advantages of
great states. for the very [[reason]] which renders the [[desire]] of power
more intense in these communities [[community]] than amongst ordinary [[men]], the [[love]] of
glory is also more prominent in the hearts [[heart]] of a class of [[citizens]],
who regard the applause of a [[great]] [[people]] as a [[reward]] worthy of their
exertions, and an elevating encouragement to [[man]]. if we would learn why
it is that [[great]] nations contribute more powerfully to the spread of
human improvement than small states, we shall discover an adequate cause
in the rapid and energetic circulation of ideas [[idea]], and in those great
cities which are the intellectual centres where all the rays of human
genius are reflected and combined. to this it may be added that most
important discoveries demand a display of national [[power]] which the
government of a small [[state]] is unable to make; in [[great]] nations the
government entertains a greater number of general notions, and is more
completely disengaged from the routine of precedent and the egotism
of local prejudice; its designs are conceived with more talent, and
executed with more boldness.

in [[time]] of [[peace]] the well-being of small nations is undoubtedly more
general and more complete, but they are apt to suffer more acutely from
the calamities of [[war]] than those [[great]] empires whose distant frontiers
may for ages [[age]] avert the presence of the danger from the mass of the
people, which is therefore more frequently afflicted than ruined by the
evil.

but in this matter, as in many others, the argument derived from the
necessity of the case predominates over all others. if none but small
nations existed, i do not [[doubt]] that [[mankind]] would be more [[happy]] and
more [[free]]; but the existence of [[great]] nations is unavoidable.

this consideration introduces the element of physical [[strength]] as a
condition of national [[prosperity]]. it profits [[profit]] a [[people]] but little to
be affluent and [[free]] if it is perpetually exposed to be pillaged
or subjugated; the number of its manufactures and the extent of its
commerce are of small advantage if another nation has the [[empire]] of the
seas and gives the [[law]] in all the markets of the globe. small nations
are often impoverished, not because they are small, but because they are
weak; the [[great]] empires [[prosper]] less because they are [[great]] than
because they are [[strong]]. physical [[strength]] is therefore one of the first
conditions of the [[happiness]] and even of the existence of nations. hence
it occurs that, unless very peculiar circumstances intervene, small
nations are always [[united]] to large empires in the end, either by force
or by their own [[consent]]: yet i am unacquainted with a more deplorable
spectacle than that of a [[people]] unable either to defend or to maintain
its independence.

the federal [[system]] was created with the intention of combining the
different advantages which result from the greater and the lesser
extent of nations; and a [[single]] glance over the [[united]] states of america
suffices to discover the advantages which they have derived from its
adoption.

in [[great]] centralized nations the legislator is obliged to impart a
character of uniformity to the laws [[law]] which does not always suit the
diversity of customs and of districts; as he takes no cognizance of
special cases, he can only proceed upon general principles [[principle]]; and the
population is obliged to conform to the exigencies of the legislation,
since the legislation cannot adapt itself to the exigencies and the
customs of the [[population]], which is the cause of endless trouble and
misery. this disadvantage does not [[exist]] in confederations. congress
regulates the principal measures of the national [[government]], and all
the details of the administration are reserved to the provincial
legislatures. it is impossible to imagine how much this division of
sovereignty contributes to the well-being of each of the states which
compose the union. in these small communities [[community]], which are never agitated
by the [[desire]] of aggrandizement or the cares [[care]] of self-defence, all public
authority and private energy is employed in internal amelioration. the
central [[government]] of each [[state]], which is in immediate juxtaposition to
the [[citizens]], is daily apprised of the wants which arise in [[society]]; and
new projects are proposed every year, which are discussed either at town
meetings or by the legislature of the [[state]], and which are transmitted
by the press to stimulate the zeal and to excite the interest of
the [[citizens]]. this spirit of amelioration is constantly alive in
the american republics [[republic]], without compromising their tranquillity; the
ambition of [[power]] yields to the less refined and less dangerous [[love]] of
comfort. it is generally believed in [[america]] that the existence and the
permanence of the republican form of [[government]] in the new [[world]] depend
upon the existence and the permanence of the federal [[system]]; and it is
not unusual to attribute a large share of the misfortunes which have
befallen the new states of south [[america]] to the injudicious erection of
great republics [[republic]], instead of a divided and confederate sovereignty.

it is incontestably true that the [[love]] and the habits of republican
government in the [[united]] states were engendered in the townships and in
the provincial assemblies. in a small [[state]], like that of connecticut
for instance, where cutting a canal or laying down a road is a momentous
political [[question]], where the [[state]] has no [[army]] to [[pay]] and no wars [[war]] to
carry on, and where much [[wealth]] and much [[honor]] cannot be bestowed upon
the [[chief]] [[citizens]], no form of [[government]] can be more [[natural]] or more
appropriate than that of a [[republic]]. but it is this same republican
spirit, it is these manners and customs of a [[free]] [[people]], which are
engendered and nurtured in the different states, to be afterwards
applied to the [[country]] at large. the [[public]] spirit of the union is, so
to speak, nothing more than an abstract of the patriotic zeal of the
provinces. every citizen of the [[united]] states transfuses his attachment
to his little [[republic]] in the [[common]] store of american [[patriotism]]. in
defending the union he defends the increasing [[prosperity]] of his own
district, the [[right]] of conducting its affairs, and the [[hope]] of causing
measures of improvement to be adopted which may be favorable to his own
interest; and these are motives which are wont to stir [[men]] more readily
than the general interests of the [[country]] and the [[glory]] of the nation.

on the other hand, if the temper and the manners of the inhabitants
especially fitted them to promote the welfare of a [[great]] [[republic]], the
federal [[system]] smoothed the obstacles which they might have encountered.
the confederation of all the american states presents [[present]] none of the
ordinary disadvantages resulting from [[great]] agglomerations of [[men]]. the
union is a [[great]] [[republic]] in extent, but the paucity of objects for
which its [[government]] provides assimilates it to a small [[state]]. its acts
are important, but they are rare. as the sovereignty of the union is
limited and incomplete, its exercise is not incompatible with [[liberty]];
for it does not excite those insatiable desires [[desire]] of fame and [[power]] which
have proved so fatal to [[great]] republics [[republic]]. as there is no [[common]] centre to
the [[country]], vast [[capital]] cities [[city]], colossal [[wealth]], abject [[poverty]], and
sudden revolutions [[revolution]] are alike unknown; and [[political]] passion, instead
of spreading over the [[land]] like a torrent of desolation, spends its
strength against the interests and the [[individual]] [[passions]] of every
state.

nevertheless, all commodities and ideas [[idea]] circulate throughout the union
as freely as in a [[country]] inhabited by one [[people]]. nothing checks the
spirit of enterprise. [[government]] avails itself of the assistance of all
who have [[talents]] or [[knowledge]] to serve it. within the frontiers of the
union the profoundest [[peace]] prevails, as within the [[heart]] of some great
empire; abroad, it ranks with the most powerful nations of the [[earth]];
two thousand miles of coast are open to the commerce of the [[world]]; and
as it possesses the keys of the globe, its flags is respected in the
most remote seas. the union is as [[happy]] and as [[free]] as a small [[people]],
and as glorious and as [[strong]] as a [[great]] nation.

why the federal [[system]] is not adapted to all peoples [[people]], and how the
anglo-americans were enabled to adopt it.

every federal [[system]] contains defects which baffle the efforts of the
legislator--the federal [[system]] is complex--it demands a daily exercise
of discretion on the part of the citizens--practical [[knowledge]] of
government [[common]] amongst the americans--relative weakness of the
government of the union, another defect inherent in the federal
system--the americans have diminished without remedying it--the
sovereignty of the separate states apparently weaker, but really
stronger, than that of the union--why?--natural causes of union must
exist between confederate peoples [[people]] besides the laws--what these causes
are amongst the anglo-americans--maine and georgia, separated by a
distance of a thousand miles, more naturally [[united]] than normandy and
brittany--war, the main peril of confederations--this proved even by
the [[example]] of the [[united]] states--the union has no [[great]] wars [[war]] to
fear--why?--dangers to which europeans [[european]] would be exposed if they adopted
the federal [[system]] of the americans.

when a legislator succeeds, after persevering efforts, in exercising an
indirect influence upon the [[destiny]] of nations, his genius is lauded
by [[mankind]], whilst, in point of [[fact]], the geographical position of the
country which he is unable to [[change]], a social condition which arose
without his co-operation, manners and opinions [[opinion]] which he cannot trace to
their source, and an origin with which he is unacquainted, exercise so
irresistible an influence over the courses of [[society]] that he is himself
borne away by the current, after an ineffectual [[resistance]]. like the
navigator, he may direct the vessel which bears him along, but he can
neither [[change]] its structure, nor raise the winds, nor lull the waters
which swell beneath him.

i have shown the advantages which the americans derive from their
federal [[system]]; it remains for me to point out the circumstances which
rendered that [[system]] practicable, as its benefits are not to be enjoyed
by all nations. the incidental defects of the federal [[system]] which
originate in the laws [[law]] may be corrected by the [[skill]] of the legislator,
but there are further evils [[evil]] inherent in the [[system]] which cannot be
counteracted by the peoples [[people]] which adopt it. these nations must therefore
find the [[strength]] necessary to support the [[natural]] imperfections of
their [[government]].

the most prominent [[evil]] of all federal systems [[system]] is the very complex
nature of the means they employ. two sovereignties are necessarily in
presence of each other. the legislator may simplify and equalize the
action of these two sovereignties, by limiting each of them to a sphere
of [[authority]] accurately defined; but he cannot combine them into one, or
prevent them from coming into collision at [[certain]] points. the federal
system therefore rests upon a theory which is necessarily complicated,
and which demands the daily exercise of a considerable share of
discretion on the part of those it governs.

a proposition must be plain to be adopted by the understanding of a
people. a false notion which is clear and precise will always meet with
a greater number of adherents in the [[world]] than a true [[principle]] which
is obscure or involved. hence it arises that parties, which are like
small communities [[community]] in the [[heart]] of the nation, invariably adopt some
principle or some name as a symbol, which very inadequately represents
the end they have in view and the means which are at their disposal, but
without which they could neither act nor subsist. the governments [[government]] which
are founded upon a [[single]] [[principle]] or a [[single]] feeling which is easily
defined are perhaps not the [[best]], but they are unquestionably the
strongest and the most durable in the [[world]].

in examining the [[constitution]] of the [[united]] states, which is the most
perfect federal [[constitution]] that ever existed, one is startled, on
the other hand, at the variety of information and the excellence of
discretion which it presupposes in the [[people]] whom it is meant to
govern. the [[government]] of the union depends entirely upon legal
fictions; the union is an ideal nation which only exists in the [[mind]],
and whose limits and extent can only be discerned by the understanding.

when once the general theory is comprehended, numberless difficulties
remain to be solved in its application; for the sovereignty of the
union is so involved in that of the states that it is impossible to
distinguish its boundaries at the first glance. the whole structure
of the [[government]] is artificial and conventional; and it would be ill
adapted to a [[people]] which has not been long accustomed to conduct
its own affairs, or to one in which the [[science]] of [[politics]] has not
descended to the humblest classes of [[society]]. i have never been more
struck by the [[good]] sense and the practical [[judgment]] of the americans
than in the ingenious devices by which they elude the numberless
difficulties resulting from their federal [[constitution]]. i scarcely
ever met with a plain american citizen who could not distinguish, with
surprising facility, the obligations created by the laws [[law]] of congress
from those created by the laws [[law]] of his own [[state]]; and who, after having
discriminated between the matters which come under the cognizance of the
union and those which the local legislature is competent to regulate,
could not point out the exact limit of the several jurisdictions of the
federal courts and the tribunals of the [[state]].

the [[constitution]] of the [[united]] states is like those exquisite
productions of [[human]] industry which ensure [[wealth]] and renown to their
inventors, but which are profitless in any other hands. this [[truth]] is
exemplified by the condition of mexico at the [[present]] [[time]]. the mexicans
were desirous of establishing a federal [[system]], and they took the
federal [[constitution]] of their neighbors, the anglo-americans, as their
model, and copied it with considerable accuracy. *s but although they
had borrowed the letter of the [[law]], they were unable to create or
to introduce the spirit and the sense which give it [[life]]. they were
involved in ceaseless embarrassments between the mechanism of their
double [[government]]; the sovereignty of the states and that of the union
perpetually exceeded their respective privileges [[privilege]], and entered into
collision; and to the [[present]] day mexico is alternately the victim of
anarchy and the [[slave]] of [[military]] despotism.

[footnote s: see the mexican [[constitution]] of 1824.]

the second and the most fatal of all the defects i have alluded to,
and that which i [[believe]] to be inherent in the federal [[system]], is the
relative weakness of the [[government]] of the union. the [[principle]] upon
which all confederations rest is that of a divided sovereignty. the
legislator may render this partition less perceptible, he may even
conceal it for a [[time]] from the [[public]] eye, but he cannot prevent it from
existing, and a divided sovereignty must always be less powerful than an
entire [[supremacy]]. the reader has seen in the remarks i have made on
the [[constitution]] of the [[united]] states that the americans have displayed
singular ingenuity in combining the restriction of the [[power]] of
the union within the narrow limits of a federal [[government]] with the
semblance and, to a [[certain]] extent, with the [[force]] of a national
government. by this means the legislators of the union have succeeded
in diminishing, though not in counteracting the [[natural]] danger of
confederations.

it has been remarked that the american [[government]] does not apply itself
to the states, but that it immediately transmits its injunctions to the
citizens, and compels them as isolated individuals [[individual]] to comply with its
demands. but if the federal [[law]] were to clash with the interests and the
prejudices of a [[state]], it might be feared that all the [[citizens]] of
that [[state]] would conceive themselves to be interested in the cause of a
single [[individual]] who should refuse to obey. if all the [[citizens]] of
the [[state]] were aggrieved at the same [[time]] and in the same manner by the
authority of the union, the federal [[government]] would vainly attempt to
subdue them individually; they would instinctively unite in a common
defence, and they would derive a ready-prepared organization from the
share of sovereignty which the institution of their [[state]] allows them
to enjoy. fiction would give way to reality, and an organized portion
of the territory might then contest the central [[authority]]. *t the same
observation holds [[good]] with regard to the federal jurisdiction. if the
courts of the union violated an important [[law]] of a [[state]] in a private
case, the real, if not the apparent, contest would arise between the
aggrieved [[state]] represented by a citizen and the union represented by
its courts of [[justice]]. *u

[footnote t: [this is precisely what occurred in 1862, and the following
paragraph describes correctly the feelings and notions of the south.
general lee held that his primary allegiance was due, not to the union,
but to virginia.]]

[footnote u: for instance, the union possesses by the [[constitution]] the
right of selling unoccupied lands [[land]] for its own [[profit]]. supposing that
the [[state]] of ohio should claim the same [[right]] in behalf of certain
territories lying within its boundaries, upon the plea that the
constitution refers to those lands [[land]] alone which do not belong to the
jurisdiction of any particular [[state]], and consequently should choose to
dispose of them itself, the litigation would be carried on in the names
of the purchasers from the [[state]] of ohio and the purchasers from the
union, and not in the names of ohio and the union. but what would become
of this legal fiction if the federal purchaser was confirmed in his
right by the courts of the union, whilst the other competitor was
ordered to retain possession by the tribunals of the [[state]] of ohio?]

he would have but a partial [[knowledge]] of the [[world]] who should imagine
that it is possible, by the aid of legal fictions, to prevent [[men]] from
finding out and employing those means of gratifying their [[passions]] which
have been left open to them; and it may be doubted whether the american
legislators, when they rendered a collision between the two sovereigns
less probable, destroyed the cause of such a misfortune. but it may even
be affirmed that they were unable to ensure the preponderance of the
federal element in a case of this [[kind]]. the union is possessed of money
and of [[troops]], but the affections and the prejudices of the [[people]] are
in the bosom of the states. the sovereignty of the union is an abstract
being, which is connected with but few external objects; the sovereignty
of the states is hourly perceptible, easily understood, constantly
active; and if the former is of recent creation, the latter is coeval
with the [[people]] itself. the sovereignty of the union is factitious, that
of the states is [[natural]], and derives its existence from its own simple
influence, like the [[authority]] of a parent. the supreme [[power]] of
the nation only affects a few of the [[chief]] interests of [[society]]; it
represents an immense but remote [[country]], and claims a feeling of
patriotism which is vague and ill defined; but the [[authority]] of the
states controls every [[individual]] citizen at every hour and in all
circumstances; it protects his [[property]], his [[freedom]], and his [[life]]; and
when we recollect the traditions, the customs, the prejudices of local
and familiar attachment with which it is connected, we cannot [[doubt]] of
the superiority of a [[power]] which is interwoven with every circumstance
that renders the [[love]] of one's native [[country]] instinctive in the human
heart.

since legislators are unable to obviate such dangerous collisions as
occur between the two sovereignties which coexist in the federal [[system]],
their first object must be, not only to dissuade the confederate states
from warfare, but to encourage such [[institutions]] as may promote the
maintenance of [[peace]]. hence it results that the federal compact cannot
be lasting unless there exists in the communities [[community]] which are leagued
together a [[certain]] number of inducements to union which render their
common dependence agreeable, and the task of the [[government]] [[light]],
and that [[system]] cannot succeed without the presence of favorable
circumstances added to the influence of [[good]] laws [[law]]. all the peoples [[people]] which
have ever formed a confederation have been held together by a certain
number of [[common]] interests, which served as the intellectual ties of
association.

but the sentiments and the principles [[principle]] of [[man]] must be taken into
consideration as well as his immediate interests. a [[certain]] uniformity
of [[civilization]] is not less necessary to the durability of a
confederation than a uniformity of interests in the states which compose
it. in switzerland the difference which exists between the canton of uri
and the canton of vaud is [[equal]] to that between the fifteenth and the
nineteenth centuries; and, properly speaking, switzerland has never
possessed a federal [[government]]. the union between these two cantons only
subsists upon the map, and their discrepancies would soon be perceived
if an attempt were made by a central [[authority]] to prescribe the same
laws to the whole territory.

one of the circumstances which most powerfully contribute to support the
federal [[government]] in [[america]] is that the states have not only similar
interests, a [[common]] origin, and a [[common]] tongue, but that they are also
arrived at the same stage of [[civilization]]; which almost always renders
a union feasible. i do not [[know]] of any [[european]] nation, how small soever
it may be, which does not [[present]] less uniformity in its different
provinces than the american [[people]], which occupies a territory as
extensive as one-half of [[europe]]. the distance from the [[state]] of maine
to that of georgia is reckoned at about one thousand miles; but the
difference between the [[civilization]] of maine and that of georgia is
slighter than the difference between the habits of normandy and those
of brittany. maine and georgia, which are placed at the opposite
extremities of a [[great]] [[empire]], are consequently in the natural
possession of more real inducements to form a confederation than
normandy and brittany, which are only separated by a bridge.

the geographical position of the [[country]] contributed to increase the
facilities which the american legislators derived from the manners and
customs of the inhabitants; and it is to this circumstance that
the adoption and the maintenance of the federal [[system]] are mainly
attributable.

the most important occurrence which can mark the annals of a [[people]] is
the breaking out of a [[war]]. in [[war]] a [[people]] struggles with the energy
of a [[single]] [[man]] against [[foreign]] nations in the defence of its very
existence. the [[skill]] of a [[government]], the [[good]] sense of the [[community]],
and the [[natural]] fondness which [[men]] entertain for their [[country]], may
suffice to maintain [[peace]] in the interior of a district, and to favor
its internal [[prosperity]]; but a nation can only carry on a [[great]] [[war]] at
the cost of more numerous and more painful sacrifices [[sacrifice]]; and to suppose
that a [[great]] number of [[men]] will of their own accord comply with these
exigencies of the [[state]] is to betray an ignorance of [[mankind]]. all the
peoples which have been obliged to sustain a long and serious warfare
have consequently been [[led]] to augment the [[power]] of their [[government]].
those which have not succeeded in this attempt have been subjugated.
a long [[war]] almost always places nations in the wretched alternative
of being abandoned to ruin by defeat or to despotism by [[success]]. war
therefore renders the symptoms of the weakness of a [[government]] most
palpable and most alarming; and i have shown that the inherent defeat of
federal governments [[government]] is that of being [[weak]].

the federal [[system]] is not only deficient in every [[kind]] of centralized
administration, but the central [[government]] itself is imperfectly
organized, which is invariably an influential cause of inferiority when
the nation is opposed to other countries [[country]] which are themselves governed
by a [[single]] [[authority]]. in the federal [[constitution]] of the [[united]] states,
by which the central [[government]] possesses more real [[force]], this evil
is still extremely sensible. an [[example]] will illustrate the case to the
reader.

the [[constitution]] confers upon congress the [[right]] of calling forth
militia to execute the laws [[law]] of the union, suppress insurrections, and
repel invasions; and another article declares that the president of the
united states is the commander-in-chief of the militia. in the [[war]] of
1812 the president ordered the militia of the northern states to march
to the frontiers; but connecticut and massachusetts, whose interests
were impaired by the [[war]], refused to obey the command. they argued that
the [[constitution]] authorizes the federal [[government]] to call forth the
militia in case of insurrection or [[invasion]], but that in the present
instance there was neither [[invasion]] nor insurrection. they added,
that the same [[constitution]] which conferred upon the union the right
of calling forth the militia reserved to the states that of naming
the officers; and that consequently (as they understood the clause) no
officer of the union had any [[right]] to command the militia, even during
war, except the president in [[person]]; and in this case they were ordered
to join an [[army]] commanded by another [[individual]]. these absurd and
pernicious doctrines received the sanction not only of the governors
and the legislative bodies [[body]], but also of the courts of [[justice]] in both
states; and the federal [[government]] was constrained to raise elsewhere
the [[troops]] which it required. *v

[footnote v: kent's "commentaries," vol. i. p. 244. i have selected an
example which relates to a [[time]] posterior to the promulgation of
the [[present]] [[constitution]]. if i had gone back to the days of the
confederation, i might have given still more striking instances. the
whole nation was at that [[time]] in a [[state]] of enthusiastic excitement; the
revolution was represented by a [[man]] who was the idol of the [[people]]; but
at that very period congress had, to say the [[truth]], no resources at
all at its disposal. [[troops]] and supplies were perpetually wanting. the
best-devised projects failed in the execution, and the union, which was
constantly on the verge of destruction, was saved by the weakness of its
enemies far more than by its own [[strength]]. [all [[doubt]] as to the powers
of the federal executive was, however, removed by its efforts in the
civil [[war]], and those powers [[power]] were largely extended.]]

the only safeguard which the american union, with all the relative
perfection of its laws [[law]], possesses against the dissolution which would
be produced by a [[great]] [[war]], lies [[lie]] in its probable exemption from that
calamity. placed in the centre of an immense continent, which offers
a boundless field for [[human]] industry, the union is almost as much
insulated from the [[world]] as if its frontiers were girt by the ocean.
canada contains only a million of inhabitants, and its [[population]] is
divided into two inimical nations. the rigor of the [[climate]] limits the
extension of its territory, and shuts up its ports during the six months
of winter. from canada to the gulf of mexico a few savage tribes are
to be met with, which retire, perishing in their retreat, before six
thousand soldiers. to the south, the union has a point of contact with
the [[empire]] of mexico; and it is thence that serious hostilities may one
day be expected to arise. but for a long while to come the uncivilized
state of the mexican [[community]], the depravity of its morals [[moral]], and its
extreme [[poverty]], will prevent that [[country]] from ranking high amongst
nations. *w as for the powers [[power]] of [[europe]], they are too distant to be
formidable.

[footnote w: [war broke out between the [[united]] states and mexico in
1846, and ended in the [[conquest]] of an immense territory, including
california.]]

the [[great]] advantage of the [[united]] states does not, then, consist in a
federal [[constitution]] which allows them to carry on [[great]] wars [[war]], but in
a geographical position which renders such enterprises extremely
improbable.

no one can be more inclined than i am myself to appreciate the
advantages of the federal [[system]], which i hold to be one of the
combinations most favorable to the [[prosperity]] and [[freedom]] of [[man]]. i
envy the lot of those nations which have been enabled to adopt it; but i
cannot [[believe]] that any confederate peoples [[people]] could maintain a long or an
equal contest with a nation of similar [[strength]] in which the government
should be centralized. a [[people]] which should divide its sovereignty into
fractional powers [[power]], in the presence of the [[great]] [[military]] monarchies [[monarchy]] of
europe, would, in my [[opinion]], by that very act, abdicate its [[power]], and
perhaps its existence and its name. but such is the admirable position
of the new [[world]] that [[man]] has no other [[enemy]] than himself; and that,
in order to be [[happy]] and to be [[free]], it suffices to seek the gifts of
prosperity and the [[knowledge]] of [[freedom]].




chapter ix: why the [[people]] may strictly be said to govern in the united
states

i have hitherto examined the [[institutions]] of the [[united]] states; i have
passed their legislation in review, and i have depicted the present
characteristics of [[political]] [[society]] in that [[country]]. but a sovereign
power exists above these [[institutions]] and beyond these characteristic
features which may [[destroy]] or modify them at its pleasure--i mean that
of the [[people]]. it remains to be shown in what manner this [[power]], which
regulates the laws [[law]], acts: its propensities and its [[passions]] remain to be
pointed out, as well as the secret springs which retard, accelerate,
or direct its irresistible course; and the effects of its unbounded
authority, with the [[destiny]] which is probably reserved for it.

in [[america]] the [[people]] appoints the legislative and the executive [[power]],
and furnishes the jurors who punish all offences against the laws [[law]]. the
american [[institutions]] are democratic, not only in their [[principle]] but
in all their consequences; and the [[people]] elects its representatives
directly, and for the most part annually, in order to ensure their
dependence. the [[people]] is therefore the real directing [[power]]; and
although the form of [[government]] is representative, it is evident that
the opinions [[opinion]], the prejudices, the interests, and even the [[passions]] of
the [[community]] are hindered by no durable obstacles from exercising
a perpetual influence on [[society]]. in the [[united]] states the majority
governs in the name of the [[people]], as is the case in all the countries
in which the [[people]] is supreme. the majority is principally composed
of peaceful [[citizens]] who, either by inclination or by interest, are
sincerely desirous of the welfare of their [[country]]. but they are
surrounded by the incessant agitation of parties, which attempt to gain
their co-operation and to avail themselves of their support.




chapter x: parties in the [[united]] states

chapter summary

great distinction to be made between parties--parties which are to each
other as rival nations--parties properly so called--difference
between [[great]] and small parties--epochs which [[produce]] them--their
characteristics--america has had [[great]] parties--they are
extinct--federalists--republicans--defeat of the federalists--difficulty
of creating parties in the [[united]] states--what is done with this
intention--aristocratic or democratic [[character]] to be met with in all
parties--struggle of general jackson against the bank.

parties in the [[united]] states

a [[great]] distinction must be made between parties. some countries [[country]] are
so large that the different populations which inhabit them have
contradictory interests, although they are the subjects [[subject]] of the same
government, and they may thence be in a perpetual [[state]] of opposition.
in this case the different fractions of the [[people]] may more properly be
considered as distinct nations than as mere parties; and if a civil war
breaks out, the struggle is carried on by rival peoples [[people]] rather than by
factions in the [[state]].

but when the [[citizens]] entertain different opinions [[opinion]] upon subjects [[subject]] which
affect the whole [[country]] alike, such, for instance, as the principles
upon which the [[government]] is to be conducted, then distinctions arise
which may correctly be styled parties. parties are a necessary [[evil]] in
free governments [[government]]; but they have not at all times [[time]] the same [[character]] and
the same propensities.

at [[certain]] periods a nation may be [[oppressed]] by such insupportable evils
as to conceive the design of effecting a total [[change]] in its political
constitution; at other times [[time]] the mischief lies [[lie]] still deeper, and the
existence of [[society]] itself is endangered. such are the times [[time]] of great
revolutions and of [[great]] parties. but between these epochs of misery and
of confusion there are periods during which [[human]] [[society]] seems to rest,
and [[mankind]] to make a pause. this pause is, indeed, only apparent, for
time does not stop its course for nations any more than for [[men]]; they
are all advancing towards a goal with which they are unacquainted; and
we only imagine them to be stationary when their [[progress]] escapes our
observation, as [[men]] who are going at a foot-pace seem to be standing
still to those who run.

but however this may be, there are [[certain]] epochs at which the changes
that take place in the social and [[political]] [[constitution]] of nations are
so slow and so insensible that [[men]] imagine their [[present]] condition to be
a final [[state]]; and the [[human]] [[mind]], believing itself to be firmly based
upon [[certain]] foundations, does not extend its researches beyond the
horizon which it descries. these are the times [[time]] of small parties and of
intrigue.

the [[political]] parties which i style [[great]] are those which cling to
principles more than to their consequences; to general, and not to
especial cases; to ideas [[idea]], and not to [[men]]. these parties are usually
distinguished by a nobler [[character]], by more generous [[passions]], more
genuine convictions, and a more bold and open conduct than the others.
in them private interest, which always plays the [[chief]] part in political
passions, is more studiously veiled under the pretext of the public
good; and it may even be sometimes concealed from the [[eyes]] of the very
persons whom it excites and impels.

minor parties are, on the other hand, generally deficient in political
faith. as they are not sustained or dignified by a lofty [[purpose]], they
ostensibly display the egotism of their [[character]] in their actions.
they glow with a factitious zeal; their [[language]] is vehement, but their
conduct is timid and irresolute. the means they employ are as wretched
as the end at which they aim. hence it arises that when a calm state
of things succeeds a [[violent]] [[revolution]], the leaders of society
seem suddenly to disappear, and the powers [[power]] of the [[human]] [[mind]] to lie
concealed. [[society]] is convulsed by [[great]] parties, by minor ones it is
agitated; it is torn by the former, by the latter it is degraded; and
if these sometimes save it by a salutary perturbation, those invariably
disturb it to no [[good]] end.

america has already lost the [[great]] parties which once divided the
nation; and if her [[happiness]] is considerably increased, her morality
has [[suffered]] by their extinction. when the [[war]] of independence was
terminated, and the foundations of the new [[government]] were to be laid
down, the nation was divided between two opinions--two opinions [[opinion]] which
are as old as the [[world]], and which are perpetually to be met with
under all the forms and all the names which have ever obtained in free
communities--the one tending to limit, the other to extend indefinitely,
the [[power]] of the [[people]]. the conflict of these two opinions [[opinion]] never
assumed that [[degree]] of [[violence]] in [[america]] which it has frequently
displayed elsewhere. both parties of the americans were, in [[fact]], agreed
upon the most essential points; and neither of them had to [[destroy]] a
traditionary [[constitution]], or to overthrow the structure of [[society]], in
order to ensure its own triumph. in neither of them, consequently, were
a [[great]] number of private interests affected by [[success]] or by defeat;
but [[moral]] principles [[principle]] of a high order, such as the [[love]] of equality and
of independence, were concerned in the struggle, and they sufficed to
kindle [[violent]] [[passions]].

the party which [[desired]] to limit the [[power]] of the [[people]] endeavored to
apply its doctrines more especially to the [[constitution]] of the union,
whence it derived its name of federal. the other party, which affected
to be more exclusively attached to the cause of [[liberty]], took that of
republican. [[america]] is a [[land]] of [[democracy]], and the federalists were
always in a minority; but they reckoned on their side almost all the
great [[men]] who had been called forth by the [[war]] of independence, and
their [[moral]] influence was very considerable. their cause was, moreover,
favored by circumstances. the ruin of the confederation had impressed
the [[people]] with a dread of [[anarchy]], and the federalists did not fail to
profit by this transient disposition of the multitude. for ten or twelve
years they were at the head of affairs, and they were able to apply
some, though not all, of their principles [[principle]]; for the hostile current was
becoming from day to day too [[violent]] to be checked or stemmed. in 1801
the republicans got possession of the [[government]]; thomas jefferson was
named president; and he increased the influence of their party by the
weight of his celebrity, the greatness of his [[talents]], and the immense
extent of his popularity.

the means by which the federalists had maintained their position were
artificial, and their resources were temporary; it was by the virtues
or the [[talents]] of their leaders that they had risen to [[power]]. when
the republicans attained to that lofty station, their opponents were
overwhelmed by utter defeat. an immense majority declared itself against
the retiring party, and the federalists found themselves in so small a
minority that they at once despaired of their future [[success]]. from that
moment the republican or democratic party *a has proceeded from conquest
to [[conquest]], until it has acquired absolute [[supremacy]] in the [[country]].
the federalists, perceiving that they were vanquished without resource,
and isolated in the midst of the nation, fell into two divisions, of
which one joined the victorious republicans, and the other abandoned its
rallying-point and its name. many years have already elapsed since they
ceased to [[exist]] as a party.

[footnote a: [it is scarcely necessary to remark that in more recent
times the signification of these terms has changed. the republicans are
the representatives of the old federalists, and the democrats of the old
republicans.--trans. note (1861).]] the accession of the federalists
to [[power]] was, in my [[opinion]], one of the most fortunate incidents which
accompanied the formation of the [[great]] american union; they resisted
the inevitable propensities of their [[age]] and of the [[country]]. but
whether their theories were [[good]] or [[bad]], they had the effect of being
inapplicable, as a [[system]], to the [[society]] which they professed to
govern, and that which occurred under the auspices of jefferson must
therefore have taken place sooner or later. but their [[government]] gave
the new [[republic]] [[time]] to acquire a [[certain]] stability, and afterwards to
support the rapid [[growth]] of the very doctrines which they had combated.
a considerable number of their principles [[principle]] were in point of [[fact]] embodied
in the [[political]] creed of their opponents; and the federal constitution
which subsists at the [[present]] day is a lasting monument of their
patriotism and their [[wisdom]].

great [[political]] parties are not, then, to be met with in the united
states at the [[present]] [[time]]. parties, indeed, may be found which threaten
the future tranquillity of the union; but there are none which seem to
contest the [[present]] form of [[government]] or the [[present]] course of [[society]].
the parties by which the union is menaced do not rest upon abstract
principles, but upon temporal interests. these interests, disseminated
in the provinces of so vast an [[empire]], may be said to constitute rival
nations rather than parties. thus, upon a recent [[occasion]], the north
contended for the [[system]] of commercial prohibition, and the south
took up arms in favor of [[free]] [[trade]], simply because the north is a
manufacturing and the south an agricultural district; and that the
restrictive [[system]] which was profitable to the one was prejudicial to
the other. *b

[footnote b: [the divisions of north and south have since acquired a
far greater [[degree]] of intensity, and the south, though conquered,
still presents [[present]] a formidable spirit of opposition to northern
government.--translator's note, 1875.]]

in the absence of [[great]] parties, the [[united]] states abound with lesser
controversies; and [[public]] [[opinion]] is divided into a thousand minute
shades of difference upon questions [[question]] of very little moment. the pains
which are taken to create parties are inconceivable, and at the present
day it is no easy task. in the [[united]] states there is no religious
animosity, because all [[religion]] is respected, and no sect is
predominant; there is no [[jealousy]] of rank, because the [[people]] is
everything, and none can contest its [[authority]]; lastly, there is no
public indigence to supply the means of agitation, because the physical
position of the [[country]] opens so wide a field to industry that [[man]] is
able to accomplish the most surprising undertakings with his own native
resources. nevertheless, ambitious [[men]] are interested in the creation of
parties, since it is difficult to eject a [[person]] from [[authority]] upon the
mere ground that his place is coveted by others. the [[skill]] of the actors
in the [[political]] [[world]] lies [[lie]] therefore in the art [[arts]] of creating parties. a
political aspirant in the [[united]] states begins by discriminating his own
interest, and by calculating upon those interests which may be collected
around and amalgamated with it; he then contrives to discover some
doctrine or some [[principle]] which may suit the purposes [[purpose]] of this new
association, and which he adopts in order to bring forward his party and
to secure his popularity; just as the imprimatur of a [[king]] was in former
days incorporated with the volume which it authorized, but to which it
nowise belonged. when these preliminaries are terminated, the new party
is ushered into the [[political]] [[world]].

all the domestic controversies of the americans at first appear to a
stranger to be so incomprehensible and so puerile that he is at a
loss whether to [[pity]] a [[people]] which takes such arrant trifles in good
earnest, or to envy the [[happiness]] which enables it to discuss them. but
when he comes to study the secret propensities which govern the factions
of [[america]], he easily perceives that the greater part of them are more
or less connected with one or the other of those two divisions which
have always existed in [[free]] communities [[community]]. the deeper we penetrate into
the working of these parties, the more do we perceive that the object
of the one is to limit, and that of the other to extend, the popular
authority. i do not assert that the ostensible end, or even that the
secret aim, of american parties is to promote the [[rule]] of [[aristocracy]] or
democracy in the [[country]]; but i affirm that aristocratic or democratic
passions may easily be detected at the bottom of all parties, and that,
although they escape a superficial observation, they are the main point
and the very [[soul]] of every faction in the [[united]] states.

to quote a recent [[example]]. when the president attacked the bank, the
country was excited and parties were formed; the well-informed classes
rallied round the bank, the [[common]] [[people]] round the president. but it
must not be imagined that the [[people]] had formed a [[rational]] [[opinion]] upon
a [[question]] which offers so many difficulties to the most experienced
statesmen. the bank is a [[great]] establishment which enjoys an independent
existence, and the [[people]], accustomed to make and unmake whatsoever it
pleases, is startled to meet with this obstacle to its [[authority]]. in the
midst of the perpetual fluctuation of [[society]] the [[community]] is irritated
by so permanent an institution, and is [[led]] to attack it in order to see
whether it can be shaken and controlled, like all the other institutions
of the [[country]].

remains of the aristocratic party in the [[united]] states

secret opposition of wealthy individuals [[individual]] to democracy--their
retirement--their taste for exclusive pleasures [[pleasure]] and for luxury at
home--their simplicity abroad--their affected condescension towards the
people.

it sometimes happens in a [[people]] amongst which various opinions [[opinion]] prevail
that the balance of the several parties is lost, and one of them obtains
an irresistible preponderance, overpowers all obstacles, harasses its
opponents, and appropriates all the resources of [[society]] to its own
purposes. the vanquished [[citizens]] despair of [[success]] and they conceal
their dissatisfaction in [[silence]] and in general apathy. the nation seems
to be governed by a [[single]] [[principle]], and the prevailing party assumes
the credit of having restored [[peace]] and unanimity to the [[country]]. but
this apparent unanimity is merely a cloak to alarming dissensions and
perpetual opposition.

this is precisely what occurred in [[america]]; when the democratic party
got the upper hand, it took exclusive possession of the conduct of
affairs, and from that [[time]] the laws [[law]] and the customs of [[society]] have
been adapted to its caprices. at the [[present]] day the more affluent
classes of [[society]] are so entirely removed from the direction of
political affairs in the [[united]] states that [[wealth]], far from conferring
a [[right]] to the exercise of [[power]], is rather an obstacle than a means of
attaining to it. the wealthy members of the [[community]] abandon the lists,
through unwillingness to contend, and frequently to contend in [[vain]],
against the poorest classes of their fellow [[citizens]]. they concentrate
all their enjoyments in the privacy of their homes [[home]], where they occupy
a rank which cannot be assumed in [[public]]; and they constitute a private
society in the [[state]], which has its own tastes and its own pleasures [[pleasure]].
they submit to this [[state]] of things as an irremediable [[evil]], but they
are careful not to show that they are galled by its continuance; it
is even not uncommon to hear them laud the delights of a republican
government, and the advantages of democratic [[institutions]] when they
are in [[public]]. next to hating their enemies [[enemy]], [[men]] are most inclined to
flatter them.

mark, for instance, that opulent citizen, who is as anxious as a jew of
the middle ages [[age]] to conceal his [[wealth]]. his dress is plain, his demeanor
unassuming; but the interior of his dwelling glitters with luxury, and
none but a few chosen guests whom he haughtily styles his equals [[equal]] are
allowed to penetrate into this sanctuary. no [[european]] [[noble]] is more
exclusive in his pleasures [[pleasure]], or more [[jealous]] of the smallest advantages
which his privileged station confers upon him. but the very same
individual crosses the [[city]] to reach a dark counting-house in the centre
of traffic, where every one may accost him who pleases. if he meets his
cobbler upon the way, they stop and converse; the two [[citizens]] discuss
the affairs of the [[state]] in which they have an [[equal]] interest, and they
shake hands before they part.

but beneath this artificial enthusiasm, and these obsequious attentions
to the preponderating [[power]], it is easy to perceive that the wealthy
members of the [[community]] entertain a hearty distaste to the democratic
institutions of their [[country]]. the populace is at once the object
of their scorn and of their fears [[fear]]. if the maladministration of the
democracy ever brings about a revolutionary crisis, and if monarchical
institutions ever become practicable in the [[united]] states, the [[truth]] of
what i advance will become obvious.

the two [[chief]] [[weapons]] which parties use in order to ensure [[success]] are
the [[public]] press and the formation of associations.




chapter xi: [[liberty]] of the press in the [[united]] states

chapter summary

difficulty of restraining the [[liberty]] of the press--particular reasons
which some nations have to cherish this liberty--the [[liberty]] of the
press a necessary consequence of the sovereignty of the [[people]] as it is
understood in america--violent [[language]] of the periodical press in the
united states--propensities of the periodical press--illustrated by the
united states--opinion of the americans upon the repression of the abuse
of the [[liberty]] of the press by judicial prosecutions--reasons for which
the press is less powerful in [[america]] than in [[france]].

liberty of the press in the [[united]] states

the influence of the [[liberty]] of the press does not affect political
opinions alone, but it extends to all the opinions [[opinion]] of [[men]], and it
modifies customs as well as laws [[law]]. in another part of this [[work]] i shall
attempt to determinate the [[degree]] of influence which the [[liberty]] of
the press has exercised upon civil [[society]] in the [[united]] states, and to
point out the direction which it has given to the ideas [[idea]], as well as the
tone which it has imparted to the [[character]] and the feelings, of the
anglo-americans, but at [[present]] i [[purpose]] simply to examine the effects
produced by the [[liberty]] of the press in the [[political]] [[world]].

i confess that i do not entertain that firm and complete attachment to
the [[liberty]] of the press which things that are supremely [[good]] in their
very [[nature]] are wont to excite in the [[mind]]; and i approve of it more
from a recollection of the evils [[evil]] it prevents than from a consideration
of the advantages it ensures.

if any one could point out an intermediate and yet a tenable position
between the complete independence and the entire subjection of the
public expression of [[opinion]], i should perhaps be inclined to adopt it;
but the difficulty is to discover this position. if it is your intention
to [[correct]] the abuses [[abuse]] of unlicensed printing and to restore the use of
orderly [[language]], you may in the first instance try the offender by
a jury; but if the jury acquits him, the [[opinion]] which was that of a
single [[individual]] becomes the [[opinion]] of the [[country]] at large. too much
and too little has therefore hitherto been done. if you proceed, you
must bring the delinquent before a court of permanent judges [[judge]]. but even
here the cause must be heard before it can be decided; and the very
principles which no [[book]] would have ventured to avow are blazoned
forth in the pleadings, and what was obscurely hinted at in a single
composition is then repeated in a multitude of other publications.
the [[language]] in which a [[thought]] is embodied is the mere carcass of the
thought, and not the [[idea]] itself; tribunals may condemn the form, but
the sense and spirit of the [[work]] is too subtle for their [[authority]]. too
much has still been done to recede, too little to attain your end; you
must therefore proceed. if you establish a censorship of the press, the
tongue of the [[public]] speaker will still make itself heard, and you have
only increased the mischief. the powers [[power]] of [[thought]] do not rely, like the
powers of physical [[strength]], upon the number of their mechanical agents,
nor can a host of authors be reckoned like the [[troops]] which compose an
army; on the contrary, the [[authority]] of a [[principle]] is often increased
by the smallness of the number of [[men]] by whom it is expressed. the
words of a strong-minded [[man]], which penetrate amidst the [[passions]] of a
listening assembly, have more [[power]] than the vociferations of a thousand
orators; and if it be allowed to speak freely in any [[public]] place,
the consequence is the same as if [[free]] speaking was allowed in every
village. the [[liberty]] of discourse must therefore be destroyed as well
as the [[liberty]] of the press; this is the necessary term of your efforts;
but if your object was to repress the abuses [[abuse]] of [[liberty]], they have
brought you to the feet of a despot. you have been [[led]] from the extreme
of independence to the extreme of subjection without meeting with a
single tenable position for shelter or repose.

there are [[certain]] nations which have peculiar reasons [[reason]] for cherishing the
liberty of the press, independently of the general motives which i have
just pointed out. for in [[certain]] countries [[country]] which profess to enjoy the
privileges of [[freedom]] every [[individual]] agent of the [[government]] may
violate the laws [[law]] with impunity, since those whom he oppresses cannot
prosecute him before the courts of [[justice]]. in this case the [[liberty]] of
the press is not merely a guarantee, but it is the only guarantee, of
their [[liberty]] and their security which the [[citizens]] possess. if the
rulers of these nations propose to abolish the independence of the
press, the [[people]] would be justified in saying: give us the [[right]] of
prosecuting your offences before the ordinary tribunals, and perhaps we
may then waive our [[right]] of appeal to the tribunal of [[public]] [[opinion]].

but in the countries [[country]] in which the doctrine of the sovereignty of the
people ostensibly prevails, the censorship of the press is not only
dangerous, but it is absurd. when the [[right]] of every citizen to
co-operate in the [[government]] of [[society]] is acknowledged, every citizen
must be presumed to possess the [[power]] of discriminating between the
different opinions [[opinion]] of his contemporaries, and of appreciating the
different facts [[fact]] from which inferences may be drawn. the sovereignty of
the [[people]] and the [[liberty]] of the press may therefore be looked upon
as correlative [[institutions]]; just as the censorship of the press and
universal suffrage are two things which are irreconcilably opposed, and
which cannot long be retained among the [[institutions]] of the same [[people]].
not a [[single]] [[individual]] of the twelve millions who inhabit the territory
of the [[united]] states has as yet dared to propose any restrictions to
the [[liberty]] of the press. the first newspaper over which i cast my [[eyes]],
upon my arrival in [[america]], contained the following article:

in all this affair the [[language]] of jackson has been that of a heartless
despot, solely occupied with the preservation of his own [[authority]].
ambition is his crime, and it will be his [[punishment]] too: intrigue is
his native element, and intrigue will confound his tricks, and will
deprive him of his [[power]]: he governs by means of [[corruption]], and his
immoral practices will redound to his shame and confusion. his conduct
in the [[political]] arena has been that of a shameless and lawless
gamester. he succeeded at the [[time]], but the hour of retribution
approaches, and he will be obliged to disgorge his winnings, to throw
aside his false dice, and to end his days in some retirement, where he
may curse his madness at his leisure; for repentance is a [[virtue]] with
which his [[heart]] is likely to remain forever unacquainted.

it is not uncommonly imagined in [[france]] that the virulence of the
press originates in the uncertain social condition, in the political
excitement, and the general sense of consequent [[evil]] which prevail in
that [[country]]; and it is therefore supposed that as soon as [[society]] has
resumed a [[certain]] [[degree]] of composure the press will abandon its present
vehemence. i am inclined to [[think]] that the above causes explain the
reason of the extraordinary ascendency it has acquired over the nation,
but that they do not exercise much influence upon the tone of its
language. the periodical press appears to me to be actuated by passions
and propensities independent of the circumstances in which it is placed,
and the [[present]] position of [[america]] corroborates this [[opinion]].

america is perhaps, at this moment, the [[country]] of the whole world
which contains the fewest germs of [[revolution]]; but the press is not less
destructive in its principles [[principle]] than in [[france]], and it displays the same
violence without the same reasons [[reason]] for indignation. in [[america]], as
in [[france]], it constitutes a singular [[power]], so strangely composed of
mingled [[good]] and [[evil]] that it is at the same [[time]] indispensable to the
existence of [[freedom]], and nearly incompatible with the maintenance of
public order. its [[power]] is certainly much greater in [[france]] than in the
united states; though nothing is more rare in the latter [[country]] than to
hear of a prosecution having been instituted against it. the reason
of this is perfectly simple: the americans, having once admitted
the doctrine of the sovereignty of the [[people]], apply it with perfect
consistency. it was never their intention to found a permanent state
of things with elements which undergo daily modifications; and there
is consequently nothing [[criminal]] in an attack upon the existing laws [[law]],
provided it be not attended with a [[violent]] infraction of them. they
are moreover of [[opinion]] that courts of [[justice]] are unable to check
the abuses [[abuse]] of the press; and that as the subtilty of [[human]] language
perpetually eludes the severity of judicial analysis, offences of this
nature are apt to escape the hand which attempts to apprehend them. they
hold that to act with efficacy upon the press it would be necessary to
find a tribunal, not only devoted to the existing order of things, but
capable of surmounting the influence of [[public]] [[opinion]]; a tribunal which
should conduct its proceedings without publicity, which should pronounce
its decrees without assigning its motives, and punish the intentions
even more than the [[language]] of an author. whosoever should have the
power of creating and maintaining a tribunal of this [[kind]] would waste
his [[time]] in prosecuting the [[liberty]] of the press; for he would be the
supreme master of the whole [[community]], and he would be as [[free]] to
rid himself of the authors as of their writings. in this [[question]],
therefore, there is no medium between servitude and extreme license; in
order to enjoy the inestimable benefits which the [[liberty]] of the press
ensures, it is necessary to submit to the inevitable evils [[evil]] which it
engenders. to expect to acquire the former and to escape the latter
is to cherish one of those illusions which commonly mislead nations
in their times [[time]] of sickness, when, tired with faction and exhausted by
effort, they attempt to combine hostile opinions [[opinion]] and contrary principles
upon the same soil.

the small influence of the american journals is attributable to several
reasons, amongst which are the following:

the [[liberty]] of writing, like all other [[liberty]], is most formidable
when it is a novelty; for a [[people]] which has never been accustomed to
co-operate in the conduct of [[state]] affairs places implicit confidence
in the first tribune who arouses its attention. the anglo-americans
have enjoyed this [[liberty]] ever since the foundation of the settlements;
moreover, the press cannot create [[human]] [[passions]] by its own [[power]],
however skillfully it may kindle them where they [[exist]]. in america
politics are discussed with animation and a varied activity, but they
rarely touch those deep [[passions]] which are excited whenever the positive
interest of a part of the [[community]] is impaired: but in the united
states the interests of the [[community]] are in a most prosperous
condition. a [[single]] glance upon a french and an american newspaper is
sufficient to show the difference which exists between the two nations
on this head. in [[france]] the space allotted to commercial advertisements
is very limited, and the [[intelligence]] is not considerable, but the most
essential part of the journal is that which contains the discussion of
the [[politics]] of the day. in [[america]] three-quarters of the enormous sheet
which is set before the reader are filled with advertisements, and the
remainder is frequently occupied by [[political]] [[intelligence]] or trivial
anecdotes: it is only from [[time]] to [[time]] that one finds a corner devoted
to passionate discussions like those with which the journalists of
france are wont to indulge their readers.

it has been demonstrated by observation, and discovered by the innate
sagacity of the pettiest as well as the [[greatest]] of despots, that the
influence of a [[power]] is increased in proportion as its direction
is rendered more central. in [[france]] the press combines a twofold
centralization; almost all its [[power]] is centred in the same spot, and
vested in the same hands, for its organs are far from numerous. the
influence of a [[public]] press thus constituted, upon a sceptical nation,
must be unbounded. it is an [[enemy]] with which a [[government]] may sign an
occasional truce, but which it is difficult to resist for any length of
time.

neither of these kinds [[kind]] of centralization exists in [[america]]. the united
states have no metropolis; the [[intelligence]] as well as the [[power]] of the
country are dispersed abroad, and instead of radiating from a point,
they cross each other in every direction; the americans have established
no central control over the expression of [[opinion]], any more than over
the conduct of [[business]]. these are circumstances which do not depend on
human foresight; but it is owing to the laws [[law]] of the union that there
are no licenses to be granted to printers, no securities demanded from
editors as in [[france]], and no stamp [[duty]] as in [[france]] and formerly in
england. the consequence of this is that nothing is easier than to set
up a newspaper, and a small number of readers suffices to defray the
expenses of the editor.

the number of periodical and occasional publications which appears
in the [[united]] states actually surpasses [[belief]]. the most enlightened
americans attribute the subordinate influence of the press to this
excessive dissemination; and it is adopted as an axiom of political
science in that [[country]] that the only way to neutralize the effect of
public journals is to multiply them indefinitely. i cannot conceive
that a [[truth]] which is so self-evident should not already have been more
generally admitted in [[europe]]; it is comprehensible that the persons [[person]] who
hope to bring about revolutions [[revolution]] by means of the press should be desirous
of confining its action to a few powerful organs, but it is perfectly
incredible that the partisans of the existing [[state]] of things, and the
natural supporters of the [[law]], should attempt to diminish the influence
of the press by concentrating its [[authority]]. the governments [[government]] of europe
seem to treat the press with the courtesy of the knights of old; they
are anxious to furnish it with the same central [[power]] which they have
found to be so trusty a weapon, in order to enhance the [[glory]] of their
resistance to its attacks.

in [[america]] there is scarcely a hamlet which has not its own newspaper.
it may readily be imagined that neither discipline nor unity of
design can be communicated to so multifarious a host, and each one is
consequently [[led]] to [[fight]] under his own standard. all the political
journals of the [[united]] states are indeed arrayed on the side of the
administration or against it; but they attack and defend in a thousand
different ways. they cannot succeed in forming those [[great]] currents of
opinion which overwhelm the most solid obstacles. this division of the
influence of the press produces [[produce]] a variety of other consequences which
are scarcely less remarkable. the facility with which journals can be
established induces a multitude of individuals [[individual]] to take a part in
them; but as the extent of competition precludes the possibility of
considerable [[profit]], the most distinguished classes of [[society]] are
rarely [[led]] to engage in these undertakings. but such is the number of
the [[public]] prints that, even if they were a source of [[wealth]], writers
of ability could not be found to direct them all. the journalists of
the [[united]] states are usually placed in a very humble position, with a
scanty [[education]] and a vulgar turn of [[mind]]. the will of the majority is
the most general of laws [[law]], and it establishes [[certain]] habits which form
the characteristics of each peculiar class of [[society]]; thus it dictates
the etiquette practised at courts and the etiquette of the bar. the
characteristics of the french journalist consist in a [[violent]], but
frequently an eloquent and lofty, manner of discussing the politics
of the day; and the exceptions to this habitual practice are only
occasional. the characteristics of the american journalist consist in
an open and coarse appeal to the [[passions]] of the populace; and he
habitually abandons the principles [[principle]] of [[political]] [[science]] to assail the
characters of individuals [[individual]], to track them into private [[life]], and disclose
all their weaknesses and errors.

nothing can be more deplorable than this [[abuse]] of the powers [[power]] of [[thought]];
i shall have [[occasion]] to point out hereafter the influence of the
newspapers upon the taste and the morality of the american [[people]], but
my [[present]] [[subject]] exclusively concerns the [[political]] [[world]]. it cannot
be denied that the effects of this extreme license of the press tend
indirectly to the maintenance of [[public]] order. the individuals [[individual]] who
are already in the possession of a high station in the esteem of their
fellow-citizens are afraid to write in the newspapers, and they are thus
deprived of the most powerful instrument which they can use to excite
the [[passions]] of the multitude to their own advantage. *a

[footnote a: they only write in the papers when they choose to address
the [[people]] in their own name; as, for instance, when they are called
upon to repel calumnious imputations, and to [[correct]] a misstatement of
facts.]

the personal opinions [[opinion]] of the editors have no [[kind]] of weight in the
eyes of the [[public]]: the only use of a journal is, that it imparts the
knowledge of [[certain]] facts [[fact]], and it is only by altering or distorting
those facts [[fact]] that a journalist can contribute to the support of his own
views.

but although the press is limited to these resources, its influence
in [[america]] is immense. it is the [[power]] which impels the circulation of
political [[life]] through all the districts of that vast territory. its eye
is constantly open to detect the secret springs of [[political]] designs,
and to summon the leaders of all parties to the bar of [[public]] [[opinion]].
it rallies the interests of the [[community]] round [[certain]] principles [[principle]], and
it draws up the creed which factions adopt; for it affords a means of
intercourse between parties which hear, and which address each other
without ever having been in immediate contact. when a [[great]] number of
the organs of the press adopt the same line of conduct, their influence
becomes irresistible; and [[public]] [[opinion]], when it is perpetually
assailed from the same side, eventually yields to the attack. in the
united states each separate journal exercises but little [[authority]], but
the [[power]] of the periodical press is only second to that of the [[people]].
*b

[footnote b: see appendix, p.]

the opinions [[opinion]] established in the [[united]] states under the [[empire]] of the
liberty of the press are frequently more firmly rooted than those which
are formed elsewhere under the sanction of a censor.

in the [[united]] states the [[democracy]] perpetually raises fresh individuals
to the conduct of [[public]] affairs; and the measures of the administration
are consequently seldom regulated by the strict rules [[rule]] of consistency or
of order. but the general principles [[principle]] of the [[government]] are more stable,
and the opinions [[opinion]] most prevalent in [[society]] are generally more durable
than in many other countries [[country]]. when once the americans have taken up an
idea, whether it be well or ill founded, nothing is more difficult than
to eradicate it from their minds [[mind]]. the same tenacity of [[opinion]] has been
observed in [[england]], where, for the [[last]] century, greater [[freedom]] of
conscience and more invincible prejudices have existed than in all the
other countries [[country]] of [[europe]]. i attribute this consequence to a cause which
may at first sight appear to have a very opposite tendency, namely, to
the [[liberty]] of the press. the nations amongst which this [[liberty]] exists
are as apt to cling to their opinions [[opinion]] from [[pride]] as from conviction.
they cherish them because they hold them to be just, and because they
exercised their own free-will in choosing them; and they maintain them
not only because they are true, but because they are their own. several
other reasons [[reason]] conduce to the same end.

it was remarked by a [[man]] of genius that "ignorance lies [[lie]] at the two ends
of [[knowledge]]." perhaps it would have been more [[correct]] to have said,
that absolute convictions are to be met with at the two extremities, and
that [[doubt]] lies [[lie]] in the middle; for the [[human]] [[intellect]] may be considered
in three distinct states, which frequently succeed one another. a man
believes implicitly, because he adopts a proposition without inquiry. he
doubts as soon as he is assailed by the objections which his inquiries
may have aroused. but he frequently succeeds in satisfying these doubts [[doubt]],
and then he begins to [[believe]] afresh: he no longer lays hold on a truth
in its most shadowy and uncertain form, but he sees it clearly before
him, and he advances onwards by the [[light]] it gives him. *c

[footnote c: it may, however, be doubted whether this rational
and self-guiding conviction arouses as much fervor or enthusiastic
devotedness in [[men]] as their first dogmatical [[belief]].]

when the [[liberty]] of the press acts upon [[men]] who are in the first of
these three states, it does not immediately disturb their habit of
believing implicitly without investigation, but it constantly modifies
the objects of their intuitive convictions. the [[human]] [[mind]] continues
to discern but one point upon the whole intellectual horizon, and
that point is in continual motion. such are the symptoms of sudden
revolutions, and of the misfortunes which are sure to befall those
generations which abruptly adopt the unconditional [[freedom]] of the press.

the circle of novel ideas [[idea]] is, however, soon terminated; the touch
of [[experience]] is upon them, and the [[doubt]] and mistrust which their
uncertainty produces [[produce]] become universal. we may rest assured that the
majority of [[mankind]] will either [[believe]] they [[know]] not wherefore, or will
not [[know]] what to [[believe]]. few are the beings who can ever [[hope]] to
attain to that [[state]] of [[rational]] and independent conviction which true
knowledge can beget in defiance of the attacks of [[doubt]].

it has been remarked that in times [[time]] of [[great]] [[religious]] fervor men
sometimes [[change]] their [[religious]] opinions [[opinion]]; whereas in times [[time]] of general
scepticism everyone clings to his own persuasion. the same thing takes
place in [[politics]] under the [[liberty]] of the press. in countries [[country]] where all
the theories of social [[science]] have been contested in their turn, the
citizens who have adopted one of them stick to it, not so much because
they are assured of its excellence, as because they are not convinced of
the superiority of any other. in the [[present]] [[age]] [[men]] are not very ready
to [[die]] in defence of their opinions [[opinion]], but they are rarely inclined to
change them; and there are fewer martyrs as well as fewer apostates.

another still more valid [[reason]] may yet be adduced: when no abstract
opinions are looked upon as [[certain]], [[men]] cling to the mere propensities
and external interests of their position, which are naturally more
tangible and more permanent than any opinions [[opinion]] in the [[world]].

it is not a [[question]] of easy solution whether [[aristocracy]] or democracy
is most fit to govern a [[country]]. but it is [[certain]] that [[democracy]] annoys
one part of the [[community]], and that [[aristocracy]] oppresses another part.
when the [[question]] is reduced to the simple expression of the struggle
between [[poverty]] and [[wealth]], the tendency of each side of the dispute
becomes perfectly evident without further controversy.

states than elsewhere--why it may be looked upon as necessary--utility

political associations in the [[united]] states

in no [[country]] in the [[world]] has the [[principle]] of association been
more successfully used, or more unsparingly applied to a multitude of
different objects, than in [[america]]. besides the permanent associations
which are established by [[law]] under the names of townships, cities [[city]],
and counties, a vast number of others are formed and maintained by the
agency of private individuals [[individual]].

the citizen of the [[united]] states is taught from his earliest infancy
to rely upon his own exertions in order to resist the evils [[evil]] and the
difficulties of [[life]]; he looks upon social [[authority]] with an eye of
mistrust and [[anxiety]], and he only claims its assistance when he is quite
unable to shift without it. this habit may even be traced in the schools
of the rising [[generation]], where the [[children]] in their games are wont to
submit to rules [[rule]] which they have themselves established, and to punish
misdemeanors which they have themselves defined. the same spirit
pervades every act of social [[life]]. if a stoppage occurs in a
thoroughfare, and the circulation of the [[public]] is hindered, the
neighbors immediately constitute a deliberative [[body]]; and this
extemporaneous assembly gives rise to an executive [[power]] which remedies
the inconvenience before anybody has [[thought]] of recurring to an
authority superior to that of the persons [[person]] immediately concerned. if the
public pleasures [[pleasure]] are concerned, an association is formed to provide
for the splendor and the regularity of the entertainment. societies [[society]] are
formed to resist enemies [[enemy]] which are exclusively of a [[moral]] [[nature]], and to
diminish the [[vice]] of intemperance: in the [[united]] states associations are
established to promote [[public]] order, commerce, industry, morality, and
religion; for there is no end which the [[human]] will, seconded by the
collective exertions of individuals [[individual]], despairs of attaining.

i shall hereafter have [[occasion]] to show the effects of association upon
the course of [[society]], and i must confine myself for the [[present]] to the
political [[world]]. when once the [[right]] of association is recognized, the
citizens may employ it in several different ways.

an association consists simply in the [[public]] assent which a number of
individuals give to [[certain]] doctrines, and in the engagement which they
contract to promote the spread of those doctrines by their exertions.
the [[right]] of association with these views is very analogous to the
liberty of unlicensed writing; but societies [[society]] thus formed possess more
authority than the press. when an [[opinion]] is represented by a [[society]],
it necessarily assumes a more exact and explicit form. it numbers its
partisans, and compromises their welfare in its cause: they, on the
other hand, become acquainted with each other, and their zeal is
increased by their number. an association unites the efforts of minds
which have a tendency to diverge in one [[single]] channel, and urges them
vigorously towards one [[single]] end which it points out.

the second [[degree]] in the [[right]] of association is the [[power]] of meeting.
when an association is allowed to establish centres of action at certain
important points in the [[country]], its activity is increased and its
influence extended. [[men]] have the opportunity of seeing each other; means
of execution are more readily combined, and opinions [[opinion]] are maintained with
a [[degree]] of warmth and energy which written [[language]] cannot approach.

lastly, in the exercise of the [[right]] of [[political]] association, there
is a third [[degree]]: the partisans of an [[opinion]] may unite in electoral
bodies, and choose delegates to represent them in a central assembly.
this is, properly speaking, the application of the representative system
to a party.

thus, in the first instance, a [[society]] is formed between individuals
professing the same [[opinion]], and the tie which keeps it together is of
a purely intellectual [[nature]]; in the second case, small assemblies are
formed which only represent a fraction of the party. lastly, in the
third case, they constitute a separate nation in the midst of the
nation, a [[government]] within the [[government]]. their delegates, like the
real delegates of the majority, represent the entire collective force
of their party; and they enjoy a [[certain]] [[degree]] of that national dignity
and [[great]] influence which belong to the chosen representatives of the
people. it is true that they have not the [[right]] of making the laws [[law]],
but they have the [[power]] of attacking those which are in being, and
of drawing up beforehand those which they may afterwards cause to be
adopted.

if, in a [[people]] which is imperfectly accustomed to the exercise
of [[freedom]], or which is exposed to [[violent]] [[political]] [[passions]], a
deliberating minority, which confines itself to the contemplation of
future laws [[law]], be placed in juxtaposition to the legislative majority, i
cannot but [[believe]] that [[public]] tranquillity incurs very [[great]] risks in
that nation. there is doubtless a very wide difference between proving
that one [[law]] is in itself [[better]] than another and proving that the
former ought to be substituted for the latter. but the imagination
of the populace is very apt to overlook this difference, which is so
apparent to the minds [[mind]] of thinking [[men]]. it sometimes happens that a
nation is divided into two nearly [[equal]] parties, each of which affects
to represent the majority. if, in immediate contiguity to the directing
power, another [[power]] be established, which exercises almost as much
moral [[authority]] as the former, it is not to be believed that it will
long be content to speak without acting; or that it will always be
restrained by the abstract consideration of the [[nature]] of associations
which are meant to direct but not to enforce opinions [[opinion]], to suggest but
not to make the laws [[law]].

the more we consider the independence of the press in its principal
consequences, the more are we convinced that it is the [[chief]] and, so to
speak, the constitutive element of [[freedom]] in the [[modern]] [[world]]. a nation
which is determined to remain [[free]] is therefore [[right]] in demanding the
unrestrained exercise of this independence. but the unrestrained liberty
of [[political]] association cannot be entirely assimilated to the liberty
of the press. the one is at the same [[time]] less necessary and more
dangerous than the other. a nation may confine it within [[certain]] limits
without forfeiting any part of its self-control; and it may sometimes be
obliged to do so in order to maintain its own [[authority]].

in [[america]] the [[liberty]] of association for [[political]] purposes [[purpose]] is
unbounded. an [[example]] will show in the clearest [[light]] to what an extent
this [[privilege]] is tolerated.

the [[question]] of the tariff, or of [[free]] [[trade]], produced a great
manifestation of party feeling in [[america]]; the tariff was not only a
subject of debate as a matter of [[opinion]], but it exercised a favorable
or a prejudicial influence upon several very powerful interests of the
states. the north attributed a [[great]] portion of its [[prosperity]], and the
south all its sufferings, to this [[system]]; insomuch that for a long
time the tariff was the sole source of the [[political]] animosities which
agitated the union.

in 1831, when the dispute was raging with the utmost virulence, a
private citizen of massachusetts proposed to all the enemies [[enemy]] of the
tariff, by means of the [[public]] prints, to send delegates to philadelphia
in order to consult together upon the means which were most fitted to
promote [[freedom]] of [[trade]]. this proposal circulated in a few days from
maine to new orleans by the [[power]] of the printing-press: the opponents
of the tariff adopted it with enthusiasm; meetings were formed on all
sides, and delegates were named. the majority of these individuals
were well known, and some of them had earned a considerable [[degree]] of
celebrity. south carolina alone, which afterwards took up arms in
the same cause, sent sixty-three delegates. on october 1, 1831, this
assembly, which according to the american custom had taken the name of
a convention, met at philadelphia; it consisted of more than two hundred
members. its debates were [[public]], and they at once assumed a legislative
character; the extent of the powers [[power]] of congress, the theories of free
trade, and the different clauses of the tariff, were discussed in turn.
at the end of ten days' deliberation the convention broke up, after
having published an address to the american [[people]], in which it
declared:

i. that congress had not the [[right]] of making a tariff, and that the
existing tariff was unconstitutional;

ii. that the prohibition of [[free]] [[trade]] was prejudicial to the interests
of all nations, and to that of the american [[people]] in particular.

it must be acknowledged that the unrestrained [[liberty]] of political
association has not hitherto produced, in the [[united]] states, those fatal
consequences which might perhaps be expected from it elsewhere. the
right of association was imported from [[england]], and it has always
existed in [[america]]; so that the exercise of this [[privilege]] is now
amalgamated with the manners and customs of the [[people]]. at the present
time the [[liberty]] of association is become a necessary guarantee against
the [[tyranny]] of the majority. in the [[united]] states, as soon as a party is
become preponderant, all [[public]] [[authority]] passes under its control; its
private supporters occupy all the places, and have all the [[force]] of the
administration at their disposal. as the most distinguished partisans
of the other side of the [[question]] are unable to surmount the obstacles
which exclude them from [[power]], they require some means of establishing
themselves upon their own basis, and of opposing the [[moral]] authority
of the minority to the physical [[power]] which domineers over it. thus a
dangerous expedient is used to obviate a still more formidable danger.

the omnipotence of the majority appears to me to [[present]] such extreme
perils to the american republics [[republic]] that the dangerous measure which is
used to repress it seems to be more advantageous than prejudicial. and
here i am about to advance a proposition which may remind the reader
of what i said before in speaking of municipal [[freedom]]: there are
no countries [[country]] in which associations are more needed, to prevent the
despotism of faction or the arbitrary [[power]] of a [[prince]], than those
which are democratically constituted. in aristocratic nations the
body of the nobles [[noble]] and the more opulent part of the [[community]] are in
themselves [[natural]] associations, which act as checks upon the abuses [[abuse]] of
power. in countries [[country]] in which these associations do not [[exist]], if
private individuals [[individual]] are unable to create an artificial and a temporary
substitute for them, i can imagine no permanent protection against the
most galling [[tyranny]]; and a [[great]] [[people]] may be [[oppressed]] by a small
faction, or by a [[single]] [[individual]], with impunity.

the meeting of a [[great]] [[political]] convention (for there are conventions
of all kinds), which may frequently become a necessary measure, is
always a serious occurrence, even in [[america]], and one which is never
looked forward to, by the judicious [[friends]] of the [[country]], without
alarm. this was very perceptible in the convention of 1831, at which the
exertions of all the most distinguished members of the assembly tended
to moderate its [[language]], and to restrain the subjects [[subject]] which it treated
within [[certain]] limits. it is probable, in [[fact]], that the convention of
1831 exercised a very [[great]] influence upon the minds [[mind]] of the malcontents,
and prepared them for the open revolt against the commercial laws [[law]] of the
union which took place in 1832.

it cannot be denied that the unrestrained [[liberty]] of association
for [[political]] purposes [[purpose]] is the [[privilege]] which a [[people]] is longest in
learning how to exercise. if it does not throw the nation into [[anarchy]],
it perpetually augments the chances [[chance]] of that calamity. on one point,
however, this perilous [[liberty]] offers a security against dangers of
another [[kind]]; in countries [[country]] where associations are [[free]], secret
societies are unknown. in [[america]] there are numerous factions, but no
conspiracies.

different ways in which the [[right]] of association is understood in
europe and in the [[united]] states--different use which is made of it.

the most [[natural]] [[privilege]] of [[man]], next to the [[right]] of acting
for himself, is that of combining his exertions with those of his
fellow-creatures, and of acting in [[common]] with them. i am therefore led
to conclude that the [[right]] of association is almost as inalienable
as the [[right]] of personal [[liberty]]. no legislator can attack it without
impairing the very foundations of [[society]]. nevertheless, if the liberty
of association is a fruitful source of advantages and [[prosperity]] to some
nations, it may be perverted or carried to excess by others, and
the element of [[life]] may be changed into an element of destruction. a
comparison of the different methods which associations pursue in those
countries in which they are managed with discretion, as well as in those
where [[liberty]] degenerates into license, may perhaps be [[thought]] useful
both to governments [[government]] and to parties.

the greater part of europeans [[european]] look upon an association as a weapon which
is to be hastily fashioned, and immediately tried in the conflict.
a [[society]] is formed for discussion, but the [[idea]] of impending action
prevails in the minds [[mind]] of those who constitute it: it is, in [[fact]], an
army; and the [[time]] given to parley serves to reckon up the [[strength]] and
to animate the [[courage]] of the host, after which they direct their march
against the [[enemy]]. resources which [[lie]] within the bounds of the [[law]] may
suggest themselves to the persons [[person]] who compose it as means, but never as
the only means, of [[success]].

such, however, is not the manner in which the [[right]] of association is
understood in the [[united]] states. in [[america]] the [[citizens]] who form
the minority associate, in order, in the first place, to show their
numerical [[strength]], and so to diminish the [[moral]] [[authority]] of the
majority; and, in the second place, to stimulate competition, and to
discover those arguments which are most fitted to act upon the majority;
for they always entertain hopes [[hope]] of drawing over their opponents to their
own side, and of afterwards disposing of the supreme [[power]] in their
name. [[political]] associations in the [[united]] states are therefore
peaceable in their intentions, and strictly legal in the means which
they employ; and they assert with [[perfect]] [[truth]] that they only aim at
success by lawful expedients.

the difference which exists between the americans and ourselves depends
on several causes. in [[europe]] there are numerous parties so diametrically
opposed to the majority that they can never [[hope]] to acquire its support,
and at the same [[time]] they [[think]] that they are sufficiently [[strong]] in
themselves to struggle and to defend their cause. when a party of this
kind forms an association, its object is, not to conquer, but to [[fight]].
in [[america]] the individuals [[individual]] who hold opinions [[opinion]] very much opposed to those
of the majority are no sort of impediment to its [[power]], and all other
parties [[hope]] to [[win]] it over to their own principles [[principle]] in the end. the
exercise of the [[right]] of association becomes dangerous in proportion
to the impossibility which excludes [[great]] parties from acquiring the
majority. in a [[country]] like the [[united]] states, in which the differences
of [[opinion]] are mere differences of hue, the [[right]] of association may
remain unrestrained without [[evil]] consequences. the inexperience of many
of the [[european]] nations in the enjoyment of [[liberty]] leads them only
to look upon the [[liberty]] of association as a [[right]] of attacking the
government. the first notion which presents [[present]] itself to a party, as well
as to an [[individual]], when it has acquired a [[consciousness]] of its own
strength, is that of [[violence]]: the notion of persuasion arises at a
later period and is only derived from [[experience]]. the english, who are
divided into parties which differ most essentially from each other,
rarely [[abuse]] the [[right]] of association, because they have long been
accustomed to exercise it. in [[france]] the passion for [[war]] is so intense
that there is no undertaking so mad, or so injurious to the welfare of
the [[state]], that a [[man]] does not consider himself honored in defending it,
at the risk of his [[life]].

but perhaps the most powerful of the causes which tend to mitigate the
excesses of [[political]] association in the [[united]] states is universal
suffrage. in countries [[country]] in which universal suffrage exists the majority
is never doubtful, because neither party can pretend to represent that
portion of the [[community]] which has not voted. the associations which
are formed are aware, as well as the nation at large, that they do not
represent the majority: this is, indeed, a condition inseparable from
their existence; for if they did represent the preponderating [[power]],
they would [[change]] the [[law]] instead of soliciting its reform. the
consequence of this is that the [[moral]] influence of the [[government]] which
they attack is very much increased, and their own [[power]] is very much
enfeebled.

in [[europe]] there are few associations which do not affect to represent
the majority, or which do not [[believe]] that they represent it. this
conviction or this pretension tends to augment their [[force]] amazingly,
and contributes no less to legalize their measures. [[violence]] may seem to
be excusable in defence of the cause of [[oppressed]] [[right]]. thus it is,
in the vast labyrinth of [[human]] laws [[law]], that extreme [[liberty]] sometimes
corrects the abuses [[abuse]] of license, and that extreme [[democracy]] obviates
the dangers of democratic [[government]]. in [[europe]], associations consider
themselves, in some [[degree]], as the legislative and executive councils of
the [[people]], which is unable to speak for itself. in [[america]], where they
only represent a minority of the nation, they argue and they petition.

the means which the associations of [[europe]] employ are in accordance
with the end which they propose to obtain. as the principal aim of these
bodies is to act, and not to debate, to [[fight]] rather than to persuade,
they are naturally [[led]] to adopt a form of organization which differs
from the ordinary customs of civil bodies [[body]], and which assumes the habits
and the maxims [[maxim]] of [[military]] [[life]]. they centralize the direction of their
resources as much as possible, and they intrust the [[power]] of the whole
party to a very small number of leaders.

the members of these associations respond to a watchword, like soldiers
on [[duty]]; they profess the doctrine of passive [[obedience]]; say rather,
that in uniting together they at once abjure the exercise of their own
judgment and [[free]] will; and the [[tyrannical]] control which these societies
exercise is often far more insupportable than the [[authority]] possessed
over [[society]] by the [[government]] which they attack. their [[moral]] [[force]] is
much diminished by these excesses, and they lose the powerful interest
which is always excited by a struggle between oppressors and the
oppressed. the [[man]] who in given cases consents to obey his fellows with
servility, and who submits his activity and even his opinions [[opinion]] to their
control, can have no claim to rank as a [[free]] citizen.

the americans have also established [[certain]] forms of [[government]] which
are applied to their associations, but these are invariably borrowed
from the forms of the civil administration. the independence of each
individual is formally recognized; the tendency of the members of the
association points, as it does in the [[body]] of the [[community]], towards
the same end, but they are not obliged to [[follow]] the same track. no
one abjures the exercise of his [[reason]] and his [[free]] will; but every
one exerts that [[reason]] and that will for the benefit of a common
undertaking.




chapter xiii: [[government]] of the [[democracy]] in america--part i

i am well aware of the difficulties which attend this part of my
subject, but although every expression which i am about to make use of
may clash, upon some one point, with the feelings of the different
parties which divide my [[country]], i shall speak my [[opinion]] with the most
perfect openness.

in [[europe]] we are at a loss how to [[judge]] the true [[character]] and the more
permanent propensities of [[democracy]], because in [[europe]] two conflicting
principles [[exist]], and we do not [[know]] what to attribute to the principles
themselves, and what to refer to the [[passions]] which they bring into
collision. such, however, is not the case in [[america]]; there the people
reigns without any obstacle, and it has no perils to dread and no
injuries to avenge. in [[america]], [[democracy]] is swayed by its own free
propensities; its course is [[natural]] and its activity is unrestrained;
the [[united]] states consequently afford the most favorable opportunity of
studying its real [[character]]. and to no [[people]] can this inquiry be more
vitally interesting than to the french nation, which is blindly driven
onwards by a daily and irresistible impulse towards a [[state]] of things
which may prove either despotic or republican, but which will assuredly
be democratic.

universal suffrage

i have already observed that universal suffrage has been adopted in
all the states of the union; it consequently occurs amongst different
populations which occupy very different positions in the scale of
society. i have had opportunities of observing its effects in different
localities, and amongst races [[race]] of [[men]] who are nearly strangers to each
other by their [[language]], their [[religion]], and their manner of [[life]]; in
louisiana as well as in new [[england]], in georgia and in canada. i have
remarked that universal suffrage is far from producing in [[america]] either
all the [[good]] or all the [[evil]] consequences which are assigned to it in
europe, and that its effects differ very widely from those which are
usually attributed to it.

choice of the [[people]], and instinctive preferences of the american
democracy

in the [[united]] states the most able [[men]] are rarely placed at the head
of affairs--reason of this peculiarity--the envy which prevails in the
lower orders of [[france]] against the higher classes is not a french, but a
purely democratic sentiment--for what [[reason]] the most distinguished men
in [[america]] frequently seclude themselves from [[public]] affairs.

many [[people]] in [[europe]] are apt to [[believe]] without saying it, or to say
without believing it, that one of the [[great]] advantages of universal
suffrage is, that it entrusts the direction of [[public]] affairs to men
who are worthy of the [[public]] confidence. they admit that the [[people]] is
unable to govern for itself, but they aver that it is always sincerely
disposed to promote the welfare of the [[state]], and that it instinctively
designates those persons [[person]] who are animated by the same [[good]] wishes [[wish]], and
who are the most fit to wield the supreme [[authority]]. i confess that the
observations i made in [[america]] by no means coincide with these opinions [[opinion]].
on my arrival in the [[united]] states i was surprised to find so much
distinguished talent among the subjects [[subject]], and so little among the heads
of the [[government]]. it is a well-authenticated [[fact]], that at the present
day the most able [[men]] in the [[united]] states are very rarely placed at
the head of affairs; and it must be acknowledged that such has been the
result in proportion as [[democracy]] has outstepped all its former limits.
the [[race]] of american statesmen has evidently dwindled most remarkably in
the course of the [[last]] fifty years.

several causes may be assigned to this phenomenon. it is impossible,
notwithstanding the most strenuous exertions, to raise the intelligence
of the [[people]] above a [[certain]] level. whatever may be the facilities of
acquiring information, whatever may be the profusion of easy methods and
of cheap [[science]], the [[human]] [[mind]] can never be instructed and educated
without devoting a considerable space of [[time]] to those objects.

the greater or the lesser possibility of subsisting without labor is
therefore the necessary boundary of intellectual improvement. this
boundary is more remote in some countries [[country]] and more restricted in others;
but it must [[exist]] somewhere as long as the [[people]] is constrained to work
in order to procure the means of physical subsistence, that is to say,
as long as it retains its popular [[character]]. it is therefore quite as
difficult to imagine a [[state]] in which all the [[citizens]] should be very
well informed as a [[state]] in which they should all be wealthy; these two
difficulties may be looked upon as correlative. it may very readily be
admitted that the mass of the [[citizens]] are sincerely disposed to promote
the welfare of their [[country]]; nay more, it may even be allowed that the
lower classes are less apt to be swayed by considerations of personal
interest than the higher orders: but it is always more or less
impossible for them to discern the [[best]] means of attaining the end which
they [[desire]] with sincerity. long and patient observation, joined to a
multitude of different notions, is required to form a just estimate of
the [[character]] of a [[single]] [[individual]]; and can it be supposed that the
vulgar have the [[power]] of succeeding in an inquiry which misleads the
penetration of genius itself? the [[people]] has neither the [[time]] nor the
means which are essential to the prosecution of an investigation of this
kind: its conclusions are hastily formed from a superficial inspection
of the more prominent features of a [[question]]. hence it often assents
to the clamor of a mountebank who knows [[know]] the secret of stimulating its
tastes, while its truest [[friends]] frequently fail in their exertions.

moreover, the [[democracy]] is not only deficient in that soundness of
judgment which is necessary to select [[men]] really deserving of its
confidence, but it has neither the [[desire]] nor the inclination to find
them out. it cannot be denied that democratic [[institutions]] have a very
strong tendency to promote the feeling of envy in the [[human]] [[heart]]; not
so much because they afford to every one the means of rising to the
level of any of his fellow-citizens, as because those means perpetually
disappoint the persons [[person]] who employ them. democratic [[institutions]] awaken
and foster a passion for equality which they can never entirely satisfy.
this complete equality eludes the grasp of the [[people]] at the very moment
at which it thinks [[think]] to hold it fast, and "flies," as pascal says, "with
eternal flight"; the [[people]] is excited in the pursuit of an advantage,
which is more precious because it is not sufficiently remote to be
unknown, or sufficiently near to be enjoyed. the lower orders
are agitated by the [[chance]] of [[success]], they are irritated by its
uncertainty; and they pass from the enthusiasm of pursuit to the
exhaustion of ill-success, and lastly to the acrimony of disappointment.
whatever transcends their own limits appears to be an obstacle to their
desires, and there is no [[kind]] of superiority, however legitimate it may
be, which is not irksome in their sight.

it has been supposed that the secret instinct which leads the lower
orders to remove their superiors as much as possible from the direction
of [[public]] affairs is peculiar to [[france]]. this, however, is an error; the
propensity to which i allude is not inherent in any particular nation,
but in democratic [[institutions]] in general; and although it may have been
heightened by peculiar [[political]] circumstances, it owes its origin to a
higher cause.

in the [[united]] states the [[people]] is not disposed to hate the superior
classes of [[society]]; but it is not very favorably inclined towards them,
and it carefully excludes them from the exercise of [[authority]]. it does
not entertain any dread of distinguished [[talents]], but it is rarely
captivated by them; and it awards its approbation very sparingly to such
as have risen without the popular support.

whilst the [[natural]] propensities of [[democracy]] induce the [[people]] to reject
the most distinguished [[citizens]] as its rulers, these individuals [[individual]] are
no less apt to retire from a [[political]] [[career]] in which it is almost
impossible to retain their independence, or to advance without degrading
themselves. this [[opinion]] has been very candidly set forth by chancellor
kent, who says, in speaking with [[great]] eulogiums of that part of the
constitution which empowers the executive to nominate the judges [[judge]]: "it is
indeed probable that the [[men]] who are [[best]] fitted to discharge the duties
of this high office would have too much reserve in their manners, and
too much austerity in their principles [[principle]], for them to be returned by the
majority at an election where universal suffrage is adopted." such were
the opinions [[opinion]] which were printed without contradiction in [[america]] in the
year 1830!

i hold it to be sufficiently demonstrated that universal suffrage is
by no means a guarantee of the [[wisdom]] of the popular [[choice]], and that,
whatever its advantages may be, this is not one of them.


causes which may partly [[correct]] these tendencies of the democracy
contrary effects produced on peoples [[people]] as well as on individuals [[individual]] by great
dangers--why so many distinguished [[men]] stood at the head of affairs
in [[america]] fifty years ago--influence which the [[intelligence]] and
the manners of the [[people]] exercise upon its choice--example of new
england--states of the southwest--influence of [[certain]] laws [[law]] upon the
choice of the people--election by an elected body--its effects upon the
composition of the senate.

when a [[state]] is threatened by serious dangers, the [[people]] frequently
succeeds in selecting the [[citizens]] who are the most able to save it.
it has been observed that [[man]] rarely retains his customary level in
presence of very critical circumstances; he rises above or he sinks
below his usual condition, and the same thing occurs in nations at
large. extreme perils sometimes quench the energy of a [[people]] instead of
stimulating it; they excite without directing its [[passions]], and instead
of clearing they confuse its powers [[power]] of perception. the [[jews]] deluged the
smoking ruins of their temple with the carnage of the remnant of their
host. but it is more [[common]], both in the case of nations and in that
of individuals [[individual]], to find extraordinary virtues [[virtue]] arising from the very
imminence of the danger. [[great]] characters [[character]] are then thrown into relief,
as edifices which are concealed by the gloom of night are illuminated by
the glare of a conflagration. at those dangerous times [[time]] genius no longer
abstains from presenting itself in the arena; and the [[people]], alarmed
by the perils of its situation, buries its envious [[passions]] in a short
oblivion. [[great]] names may then be drawn from the balloting-box.

i have already observed that the american statesmen of the [[present]] day
are very inferior to those who stood at the head of affairs fifty years
ago. this is as much a consequence of the circumstances as of the
laws of the [[country]]. when [[america]] was struggling in the high cause of
independence to throw off the yoke of another [[country]], and when it
was about to usher a new nation into the [[world]], the spirits of its
inhabitants were roused to the height which their [[great]] efforts
required. in this general excitement the most distinguished [[men]] were
ready to forestall the wants of the [[community]], and the [[people]] clung
to them for support, and placed them at its head. but events of this
magnitude are rare, and it is from an inspection of the ordinary course
of affairs that our [[judgment]] must be formed.

if passing occurrences sometimes act as checks upon the [[passions]] of
democracy, the [[intelligence]] and the manners of the [[community]] exercise
an influence which is not less powerful and far more permanent. this is
extremely perceptible in the [[united]] states.

in new [[england]] the [[education]] and the liberties [[liberty]] of the communities [[community]] were
engendered by the [[moral]] and [[religious]] principles [[principle]] of their founders.
where [[society]] has acquired a sufficient [[degree]] of stability to enable it
to hold [[certain]] maxims [[maxim]] and to retain fixed habits, the lower orders
are accustomed to [[respect]] intellectual superiority and to submit to
it without complaint, although they set at naught all those privileges
which [[wealth]] and birth have introduced among [[mankind]]. the democracy
in new [[england]] consequently makes a more judicious [[choice]] than it does
elsewhere.

but as we descend towards the south, to those states in which
the [[constitution]] of [[society]] is more [[modern]] and less [[strong]], where
instruction is less general, and where the principles [[principle]] of morality, of
religion, and of [[liberty]] are less happily combined, we perceive that the
talents and the virtues [[virtue]] of those who are in [[authority]] become more and
more rare.

lastly, when we arrive at the new south-western states, in which the
constitution of [[society]] dates but from yesterday, and presents [[present]] an
agglomeration of adventurers and speculators, we are amazed at the
persons who are invested with [[public]] [[authority]], and we are [[led]] to ask by
what [[force]], independent of the legislation and of the [[men]] who direct it,
the [[state]] can be protected, and [[society]] be made to flourish.

there are [[certain]] laws [[law]] of a democratic [[nature]] which contribute,
nevertheless, to [[correct]], in some measure, the dangerous tendencies of
democracy. on entering the house of representatives of washington one is
struck by the vulgar demeanor of that [[great]] assembly. the eye frequently
does not discover a [[man]] of celebrity within its walls. its members are
almost all obscure individuals [[individual]] whose names [[present]] no associations to
the [[mind]]: they are mostly village lawyers, [[men]] in [[trade]], or even
persons belonging to the lower classes of [[society]]. in a [[country]] in which
education is very general, it is said that the representatives of the
people do not always [[know]] how to write correctly.

at a few yards' distance from this spot is the door of the senate, which
contains within a small space a large proportion of the celebrated men
of [[america]]. scarcely an [[individual]] is to be perceived in it who does
not recall the [[idea]] of an active and illustrious [[career]]: the senate
is composed of eloquent advocates, distinguished generals, wise
magistrates, and statesmen of note, whose [[language]] would at all times [[time]] do
honor to the most remarkable parliamentary debates of [[europe]].

what then is the cause of this [[strange]] contrast, and why are the most
able [[citizens]] to be found in one assembly rather than in the other?
why is the former [[body]] remarkable for its vulgarity and its [[poverty]] of
talent, whilst the latter seems to enjoy a [[monopoly]] of [[intelligence]] and
of sound [[judgment]]? both of these assemblies emanate from the [[people]];
both of them are chosen by universal suffrage; and no voice has hitherto
been heard to assert in [[america]] that the senate is hostile to the
interests of the [[people]]. from what cause, then, does so startling a
difference arise? the only [[reason]] which appears to me adequately to
account for it is, that the house of representatives is elected by the
populace directly, and that the senate is elected by elected bodies [[body]]. the
whole [[body]] of the [[citizens]] names the legislature of each [[state]], and the
federal [[constitution]] converts these legislatures into so many electoral
bodies, which return the members of the senate. the senators are elected
by an indirect application of universal suffrage; for the legislatures
which name them are not aristocratic or privileged bodies [[body]] which exercise
the electoral franchise in their own [[right]]; but they are chosen by the
totality of the [[citizens]]; they are generally elected every year, and new
members may constantly be chosen who will employ their electoral rights
in conformity with the wishes [[wish]] of the [[public]]. but this transmission of
the popular [[authority]] through an assembly of chosen [[men]] operates an
important [[change]] in it, by refining its discretion and improving the
forms which it adopts. [[men]] who are chosen in this manner accurately
represent the majority of the nation which governs them; but they
represent the elevated thoughts [[thought]] which are current in the [[community]],
the propensities which prompt its nobler actions, rather than the petty
passions which disturb or the vices [[vice]] which disgrace it.

the [[time]] may be already anticipated at which the american republics [[republic]] will
be obliged to introduce the plan of election by an elected [[body]] more
frequently into their [[system]] of representation, or they will incur no
small risk of perishing miserably amongst the shoals of [[democracy]].

and here i have no scruple in confessing that i look upon this peculiar
system of election as the only means of bringing the exercise of
political [[power]] to the level of all classes of the [[people]]. those
thinkers who regard this institution as the exclusive weapon of a party,
and those who [[fear]], on the other hand, to make use of it, seem to me to
fall into as [[great]] an error in the one case as in the other.

influence which the american [[democracy]] has exercised on the laws
relating to elections

when elections are rare, they expose the [[state]] to a [[violent]] crisis--when
they are frequent, they keep up a [[degree]] of feverish excitement--the
americans have preferred the second of these two evils--mutability of
the laws--opinions of hamilton and jefferson on this [[subject]].

when elections recur at long intervals the [[state]] is exposed to violent
agitation every [[time]] they take place. parties exert themselves to the
utmost in order to gain a prize which is so rarely within their reach;
and as the [[evil]] is almost irremediable for the candidates who fail, the
consequences of their disappointed [[ambition]] may prove most disastrous;
if, on the other hand, the legal struggle can be repeated within a short
space of [[time]], the defeated parties take patience. when elections occur
frequently, their recurrence keeps [[society]] in a perpetual [[state]] of
feverish excitement, and imparts a continual instability to public
affairs.


thus, on the one hand the [[state]] is exposed to the perils of a
revolution, on the other to perpetual mutability; the former system
threatens the very existence of the [[government]], the latter is an
obstacle to all steady and consistent policy. the americans have
preferred the second of these evils [[evil]] to the first; but they were [[led]] to
this conclusion by their instinct much more than by their [[reason]]; for a
taste for variety is one of the characteristic [[passions]] of [[democracy]]. an
extraordinary mutability has, by this means, been introduced into their
legislation. many of the americans consider the instability of their
laws as a necessary consequence of a [[system]] whose general results are
beneficial. but no one in the [[united]] states affects to deny the [[fact]] of
this instability, or to contend that it is not a [[great]] [[evil]].

hamilton, after having demonstrated the utility of a [[power]] which might
prevent, or which might at least impede, the promulgation of [[bad]] laws [[law]],
adds: "it might perhaps be said that the [[power]] of preventing [[bad]] laws
includes that of preventing [[good]] ones, and may be used to the one
purpose as well as to the other. but this objection will have little
weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that
inconstancy and mutability in the laws [[law]] which form the [[greatest]] blemish
in the [[character]] and genius of our governments [[government]]." (federalist, no. 73.)
and again in no. 62 of the same [[work]] he observes: "the facility and
excess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments
are most liable. . . . the mischievous effects of the mutability in the
public councils arising from a rapid succession of new members would
fill a volume: every new election in the states is found to change
one-half of the representatives. from this [[change]] of [[men]] must proceed
a [[change]] of opinions [[opinion]] and of measures, which forfeits the [[respect]] and
confidence of other nations, poisons the blessings of [[liberty]] itself,
and diminishes the attachment and reverence of the [[people]] toward a
political [[system]] which betrays so many marks of infirmity."

jefferson himself, the [[greatest]] democrat whom the [[democracy]] of america
has yet produced, pointed out the same evils [[evil]]. "the instability of
our laws [[law]]," said he in a letter to madison, "is really a very serious
inconvenience. i [[think]] that we ought to have obviated it by deciding
that a whole year should always be allowed to elapse between the
bringing in of a bill and the final passing of it. it should afterward
be discussed and put to the vote without the possibility of making any
alteration in it; and if the circumstances of the case required a
more speedy decision, the [[question]] should not be decided by a simple
majority, but by a majority of at least two-thirds of both houses."

public officers under the control of the [[democracy]] in [[america]] simple
exterior of the american [[public]] officers--no official costume--all
public officers are remunerated--political consequences of this
system--no [[public]] [[career]] exists in america--result of this.

public officers in the [[united]] states are commingled with the crowd
of [[citizens]]; they have neither palaces, nor guards, nor ceremonial
costumes. this simple exterior of the persons [[person]] in [[authority]] is connected
not only with the peculiarities of the american [[character]], but with
the fundamental principles [[principle]] of that [[society]]. in the estimation of the
democracy a [[government]] is not a benefit, but a necessary [[evil]]. a certain
degree of [[power]] must be granted to [[public]] officers, for they would be
of no use without it. but the ostensible semblance of [[authority]] is by
no means indispensable to the conduct of affairs, and it is needlessly
offensive to the susceptibility of the [[public]]. the [[public]] officers
themselves are well aware that they only enjoy the superiority over
their fellow-citizens which they derive from their [[authority]] upon
condition of putting themselves on a level with the whole [[community]] by
their manners. a [[public]] officer in the [[united]] states is uniformly civil,
accessible to all the [[world]], attentive to all requests, and obliging
in his replies. i was pleased by these characteristics of a democratic
government; and i was struck by the manly independence of the [[citizens]],
who [[respect]] the office more than the officer, and who are less attached
to the emblems of [[authority]] than to the [[man]] who bears them.

i am inclined to [[believe]] that the influence which costumes really
exercise, in an [[age]] like that in which we [[live]], has been a [[good]] deal
exaggerated. i never perceived that a [[public]] officer in [[america]] was the
less respected whilst he was in the discharge of his duties [[duty]] because his
own [[merit]] was set off by no adventitious signs. on the other hand, it is
very doubtful whether a peculiar dress contributes to the [[respect]] which
public characters [[character]] ought to have for their own position, at least when
they are not otherwise inclined to [[respect]] it. when a magistrate (and
in [[france]] such instances are not rare) indulges his trivial wit at the
expense of the [[prisoner]], or derides the predicament in which a culprit
is placed, it would be well to deprive him of his robes of office,
to see whether he would recall some portion of the [[natural]] [[dignity]] of
mankind when he is reduced to the apparel of a private citizen.

a [[democracy]] may, however, allow a [[certain]] show of magisterial pomp, and
clothe its officers in silks and gold, without seriously compromising
its principles [[principle]]. privileges [[privilege]] of this [[kind]] are transitory; they belong to
the place, and are distinct from the [[individual]]: but if [[public]] officers
are not uniformly remunerated by the [[state]], the [[public]] charges must be
entrusted to [[men]] of opulence and independence, who constitute the
basis of an [[aristocracy]]; and if the [[people]] still retains its right
of election, that election can only be made from a [[certain]] class of
citizens. when a democratic [[republic]] renders offices which had formerly
been remunerated gratuitous, it may safely be believed that the state
is advancing to monarchical [[institutions]]; and when a [[monarchy]] begins to
remunerate such officers as had hitherto been unpaid, it is a sure
sign that it is approaching toward a despotic or a republican form of
government. the substitution of paid for unpaid functionaries is of
itself, in my [[opinion]], sufficient to constitute a serious [[revolution]].

i look upon the entire absence of gratuitous functionaries in [[america]] as
one of the most prominent signs of the absolute dominion which democracy
exercises in that [[country]]. all [[public]] services, of whatsoever nature
they may be, are paid; so that every one has not merely the [[right]], but
also the means of performing them. although, in democratic states, all
the [[citizens]] are qualified to occupy stations in the [[government]], all
are not tempted to try for them. the number and the capacities of the
candidates are more apt to restrict the [[choice]] of electors than the
connections of the candidateship.

in nations in which the [[principle]] of election extends to every place in
the [[state]] no [[political]] [[career]] can, properly speaking, be said to [[exist]].
men are promoted as if by [[chance]] to the rank which they enjoy, and
they are by no means sure of retaining it. the consequence is that in
tranquil times [[time]] [[public]] functions offer but few lures to [[ambition]]. in the
united states the persons [[person]] who engage in the perplexities of political
life are individuals [[individual]] of very moderate pretensions. the pursuit of wealth
generally diverts [[men]] of [[great]] [[talents]] and of [[great]] [[passions]] from the
pursuit of [[power]], and it very frequently happens that a [[man]] does not
undertake to direct the [[fortune]] of the [[state]] until he has discovered
his incompetence to conduct his own affairs. the vast number of very
ordinary [[men]] who occupy [[public]] stations is quite as attributable to
these causes as to the [[bad]] [[choice]] of the [[democracy]]. in the united
states, i am not sure that the [[people]] would return the [[men]] of superior
abilities who might solicit its support, but it is [[certain]] that [[men]] of
this description do not come forward.

arbitrary [[power]] of magistrates under the [[rule]] of the american democracy

for what [[reason]] the arbitrary [[power]] of magistrates is greater in
absolute monarchies [[monarchy]] and in democratic republics [[republic]] than it is in limited
monarchies--arbitrary [[power]] of the magistrates in new [[england]].

in two different kinds [[kind]] of [[government]] the magistrates *a exercise a
considerable [[degree]] of arbitrary [[power]]; namely, under the absolute
government of a [[single]] [[individual]], and under that of a [[democracy]]. this
identical result proceeds from causes which are nearly analogous.

[footnote a: i here use the word magistrates in the widest sense in
which it can be taken; i apply it to all the officers to whom the
execution of the laws [[law]] is intrusted.]

in despotic states the [[fortune]] of no citizen is secure; and public
officers are not more safe than private individuals [[individual]]. the [[sovereign]], who
has under his control the lives [[life]], the [[property]], and sometimes the honor
of the [[men]] whom he employs, does not scruple to allow them a great
latitude of action, because he is convinced that they will not use it
to his prejudice. in despotic states the [[sovereign]] is so attached to the
exercise of his [[power]], that he dislikes the constraint even of his own
regulations; and he is well pleased that his agents should [[follow]] a
somewhat fortuitous line of conduct, provided he be [[certain]] that their
actions will never counteract his desires [[desire]].

in democracies [[democracy]], as the majority has every year the [[right]] of depriving
the officers whom it has appointed of their [[power]], it has no reason
to [[fear]] any [[abuse]] of their [[authority]]. as the [[people]] is always able
to signify its wishes [[wish]] to those who conduct the [[government]], it prefers
leaving them to make their own exertions to prescribing an invariable
rule of conduct which would at once fetter their activity and the
popular [[authority]].

it may even be observed, on attentive consideration, that under the
rule of a [[democracy]] the arbitrary [[power]] of the magistrate must be still
greater than in despotic states. in the latter the [[sovereign]] has the
power of punishing all the faults [[fault]] with which he becomes acquainted, but
it would be [[vain]] for him to [[hope]] to become acquainted with all those
which are committed. in the former the [[sovereign]] [[power]] is not only
supreme, but it is universally [[present]]. the american functionaries are,
in point of [[fact]], much more independent in the sphere of action which
the [[law]] traces out for them than any [[public]] officer in [[europe]]. very
frequently the object which they are to accomplish is simply pointed out
to them, and the [[choice]] of the means is left to their own discretion.

in new [[england]], for instance, the selectmen of each township are bound
to draw up the list of persons [[person]] who are to serve on the jury; the only
rule which is laid down to guide them in their [[choice]] is that they are
to select [[citizens]] possessing the elective franchise and enjoying a fair
reputation. *b in [[france]] the lives [[life]] and liberties [[liberty]] of the subjects [[subject]] would
be [[thought]] to be in danger if a [[public]] officer of any [[kind]] was entrusted
with so formidable a [[right]]. in new [[england]] the same magistrates are
empowered to post the names of habitual drunkards in public-houses, and
to prohibit the inhabitants of a town from supplying them with liquor.
*c a censorial [[power]] of this excessive [[kind]] would be revolting to
the [[population]] of the most absolute monarchies [[monarchy]]; here, however, it is
submitted to without difficulty.

[footnote b: see the act of february 27, 1813. "general collection of
the laws [[law]] of massachusetts," vol. ii. p. 331. it should be added that the
jurors are afterwards drawn from these lists by lot.]

[footnote c: see act of february 28, 1787. "general collection of the
laws of massachusetts," vol. i. p. 302.]

nowhere has so much been left by the [[law]] to the arbitrary determination
of the magistrate as in democratic republics [[republic]], because this arbitrary
power is unattended by any alarming consequences. it may even be
asserted that the [[freedom]] of the magistrate increases as the elective
franchise is extended, and as the duration of the [[time]] of office
is shortened. hence arises the [[great]] difficulty which attends the
conversion of a democratic [[republic]] into a [[monarchy]]. the magistrate
ceases to be elective, but he retains the rights [[right]] and the habits of an
elected officer, which lead directly to despotism.

it is only in limited monarchies [[monarchy]] that the [[law]], which prescribes the
sphere in which [[public]] officers are to act, superintends all their
measures. the cause of this may be easily detected. in limited
monarchies the [[power]] is divided between the [[king]] and the [[people]], both
of whom are interested in the stability of the magistrate. the king
does not venture to place the [[public]] officers under the control of the
people, lest they should be tempted to betray his interests; on the
other hand, the [[people]] fears [[fear]] lest the magistrates should serve to
oppress the liberties [[liberty]] of the [[country]], if they were entirely dependent
upon the [[crown]]; they cannot therefore be said to depend on either one
or the other. the same cause which induces the [[king]] and the people
to render [[public]] officers independent suggests the necessity of such
securities as may prevent their independence from encroaching upon
the [[authority]] of the former and the liberties [[liberty]] of the latter. they
consequently agree as to the necessity of restricting the functionary
to a line of conduct laid down beforehand, and they are interested in
confining him by [[certain]] regulations which he cannot evade.




chapter xiii: [[government]] of the [[democracy]] in america--part ii

instability of the administration in the [[united]] states

in [[america]] the [[public]] acts of a [[community]] frequently leave fewer
traces than the occurrences of a family--newspapers the only historical
remains--instability of the administration prejudicial to the art [[arts]] of
government.

the [[authority]] which [[public]] [[men]] possess in [[america]] is so brief, and they
are so soon commingled with the ever-changing [[population]] of the [[country]],
that the acts of a [[community]] frequently leave fewer traces than the
occurrences of a private [[family]]. the [[public]] administration is, so to
speak, oral and traditionary. but little is committed to writing, and
that little is wafted away forever, like the leaves of the sibyl, by the
smallest breeze.

the only historical remains in the [[united]] states are the newspapers; but
if a number be wanting, the chain of [[time]] is broken, and the present
is severed from the [[past]]. i am convinced that in fifty years it will
be more difficult to collect authentic documents concerning the social
condition of the americans at the [[present]] day than it is to find remains
of the administration of [[france]] during the middle ages [[age]]; and if the
united states were ever invaded by barbarians, it would be necessary to
have recourse to the [[history]] of other nations in order to learn anything
of the [[people]] which now inhabits them.

the instability of the administration has penetrated into the habits of
the [[people]]: it even appears to suit the general taste, and no one cares
for what occurred before his [[time]]. no methodical [[system]] is pursued; no
archives are formed; and no documents are brought together when it would
be very easy to do so. where they [[exist]], little store is set upon them;
and i have amongst my papers several original [[public]] documents which
were given to me in [[answer]] to some of my inquiries. in america
society seems to [[live]] from hand to mouth, like an [[army]] in the field.
nevertheless, the art [[arts]] of administration may undoubtedly be ranked as
a [[science]], and no sciences [[science]] can be improved if the discoveries and
observations of successive generations [[generation]] are not connected together in
the order in which they occur. one [[man]], in the short space of his life
remarks a [[fact]]; another conceives an [[idea]]; the former invents a means
of execution, the latter reduces a [[truth]] to a fixed proposition; and
mankind gathers the fruits of [[individual]] [[experience]] upon its way
and gradually forms the sciences [[science]]. but the persons [[person]] who conduct the
administration in [[america]] can seldom afford any instruction to each
other; and when they assume the direction of [[society]], they simply
possess those attainments which are most widely disseminated in the
community, and no [[experience]] peculiar to themselves. [[democracy]],
carried to its furthest limits, is therefore prejudicial to the art [[arts]] of
government; and for this [[reason]] it is [[better]] adapted to a [[people]] already
versed in the conduct of an administration than to a nation which is
uninitiated in [[public]] affairs.

this remark, indeed, is not exclusively applicable to the [[science]] of
administration. although a democratic [[government]] is founded upon a very
simple and [[natural]] [[principle]], it always presupposes the existence of
a high [[degree]] of [[culture]] and enlightenment in [[society]]. *d at the first
glance it may be imagined to belong to the earliest ages [[age]] of the [[world]];
but maturer observation will convince us that it could only come [[last]] in
the succession of [[human]] [[history]].

[footnote d: it is needless to observe that i speak here of the
democratic form of [[government]] as applied to a [[people]], not merely to a
tribe.]

charges levied by the [[state]] under the [[rule]] of the american democracy

in all communities [[community]] [[citizens]] divisible into three classes--habits of
each of these classes in the direction of [[public]] finances--why public
expenditure must tend to increase when the [[people]] governs--what renders
the extravagance of a [[democracy]] less to be feared in america--public
expenditure under a [[democracy]].

before we can affirm whether a democratic form of [[government]] is
economical or not, we must establish a suitable standard of comparison.
the [[question]] would be one of easy solution if we were to attempt to draw
a parallel between a democratic [[republic]] and an absolute [[monarchy]]. the
public expenditure would be found to be more considerable under the
former than under the latter; such is the case with all [[free]] states
compared to those which are not so. it is [[certain]] that despotism ruins
individuals by preventing them from producing [[wealth]], much more than by
depriving them of the [[wealth]] they have produced; it dries up the source
of riches [[rich]], whilst it usually respects [[respect]] acquired [[property]]. [[freedom]], on the
contrary, engenders far more benefits than it destroys; and the nations
which are favored by [[free]] [[institutions]] invariably find that their
resources increase even more rapidly than their taxes.

my [[present]] object is to compare [[free]] nations to each other, and to point
out the influence of [[democracy]] upon the finances of a [[state]].

communities, as well as organic bodies [[body]], are [[subject]] to [[certain]] fixed
rules in their formation which they cannot evade. they are composed of
certain elements which are [[common]] to them at all times [[time]] and under all
circumstances. the [[people]] may always be mentally divided into three
distinct classes. the first of these classes consists of the wealthy;
the second, of those who are in easy circumstances; and the third is
composed of those who have little or no [[property]], and who subsist more
especially by the [[work]] which they perform for the two superior orders.
the proportion of the individuals [[individual]] who are included in these three
divisions may vary according to the condition of [[society]], but the
divisions themselves can never be obliterated.

it is evident that each of these classes will exercise an influence
peculiar to its own propensities upon the administration of the finances
of the [[state]]. if the first of the three exclusively possesses the
legislative [[power]], it is probable that it will not be sparing of the
public funds, because the taxes which are levied on a large [[fortune]] only
tend to diminish the sum of superfluous enjoyment, and are, in point of
fact, but little [[felt]]. if the second class has the [[power]] of making the
laws, it will certainly not be lavish of taxes, because nothing is
so onerous as a large impost which is levied upon a small income.
the [[government]] of the middle classes appears to me to be the most
economical, though perhaps not the most enlightened, and certainly not
the most generous, of [[free]] governments [[government]].

but let us now suppose that the legislative [[authority]] is vested in
the lowest orders: there are two striking reasons [[reason]] which show that the
tendency of the expenditure will be to increase, not to diminish. as the
great majority of those who create the laws [[law]] are possessed of no property
upon which taxes can be imposed, all the [[money]] which is spent for the
community appears to be spent to their advantage, at no cost of their
own; and those who are possessed of some little [[property]] readily find
means of regulating the taxes so that they are burdensome to the wealthy
and profitable to the [[poor]], although the [[rich]] are unable to take the
same advantage when they are in possession of the [[government]].

in countries [[country]] in which the [[poor]] *e should be exclusively invested with
the [[power]] of making the laws [[law]] no [[great]] economy of [[public]] expenditure
ought to be expected: that expenditure will always be considerable;
either because the taxes do not weigh upon those who levy them, or
because they are levied in such a manner as not to weigh upon those
classes. in other words, the [[government]] of the [[democracy]] is the only one
under which the [[power]] which lays on taxes escapes the payment of them.

[footnote e: the word [[poor]] is used here, and throughout the remainder
of this [[chapter]], in a relative, not in an absolute sense. [[poor]] [[men]] in
america would often appear [[rich]] in comparison with the [[poor]] of [[europe]];
but they may with propriety by styled [[poor]] in comparison with their more
affluent countrymen.]

it may be objected (but the argument has no real weight) that the
true interest of the [[people]] is indissolubly connected with that of the
wealthier portion of the [[community]], since it cannot but suffer by the
severe measures to which it resorts. but is it not the true interest of
kings to render their subjects [[subject]] [[happy]], and the true interest of nobles
to admit recruits into their order on suitable grounds? if remote
advantages had [[power]] to prevail over the [[passions]] and the exigencies
of the moment, no such thing as a [[tyrannical]] [[sovereign]] or an exclusive
aristocracy could ever [[exist]].

again, it may be objected that the [[poor]] are never invested with the sole
power of making the laws [[law]]; but i reply, that wherever universal suffrage
has been established the majority of the [[community]] unquestionably
exercises the legislative [[authority]]; and if it be proved that the poor
always constitute the majority, it may be added, with [[perfect]] [[truth]],
that in the countries [[country]] in which they possess the elective franchise they
possess the sole [[power]] of making laws [[law]]. but it is [[certain]] that in all the
nations of the [[world]] the greater number has always consisted of those
persons who hold no [[property]], or of those whose [[property]] is insufficient
to exempt them from the necessity of working in order to procure an easy
subsistence. universal suffrage does therefore, in point of [[fact]], invest
the [[poor]] with the [[government]] of [[society]].

the disastrous influence which popular [[authority]] may sometimes exercise
upon the finances of a [[state]] was very clearly seen in some of the
democratic republics [[republic]] of antiquity, in which the [[public]] treasure was
exhausted in order to relieve indigent [[citizens]], or to supply the
games and theatrical amusements of the populace. it is true that the
representative [[system]] was then very imperfectly known, and that, at
the [[present]] [[time]], the influence of popular passion is less [[felt]] in the
conduct of [[public]] affairs; but it may be believed that the delegate
will in the end conform to the principles [[principle]] of his constituents, and favor
their propensities as much as their interests.

the extravagance of [[democracy]] is, however, less to be dreaded in
proportion as the [[people]] acquires a share of [[property]], because on the
one hand the contributions of the [[rich]] are then less needed, and, on
the other, it is more difficult to lay on taxes which do not affect the
interests of the lower classes. on this account universal suffrage
would be less dangerous in [[france]] than in [[england]], because in the latter
country the [[property]] on which taxes may be levied is vested in fewer
hands. [[america]], where the [[great]] majority of the [[citizens]] possess some
fortune, is in a still more favorable position than [[france]].

there are still further causes which may increase the sum of public
expenditure in democratic countries [[country]]. when the [[aristocracy]] governs, the
individuals who conduct the affairs of [[state]] are exempted by their own
station in [[society]] from every [[kind]] of privation; they are contented with
their position; [[power]] and renown are the objects for which they strive;
and, as they are placed far above the obscurer throng of [[citizens]], they
do not always distinctly perceive how the well-being of the mass of the
people ought to redound to their own [[honor]]. they are not indeed callous
to the sufferings of the [[poor]], but they cannot [[feel]] those miseries as
acutely as if they were themselves partakers of them. provided that the
people appear to submit to its lot, the rulers are satisfied, and they
demand nothing further from the [[government]]. an [[aristocracy]] is more
intent upon the means of maintaining its influence than upon the means
of improving its condition.

when, on the contrary, the [[people]] is invested with the supreme
authority, the perpetual sense of their own miseries impels the rulers
of [[society]] to seek for perpetual ameliorations. a thousand different
objects are subjected to improvement; the most trivial details are
sought out as susceptible of amendment; and those changes [[change]] which are
accompanied with considerable expense are more especially advocated,
since the object is to render the condition of the [[poor]] more tolerable,
who cannot [[pay]] for themselves.

moreover, all democratic communities [[community]] are agitated by an ill-defined
excitement and by a [[kind]] of feverish [[impatience]], that engender a
multitude of innovations, almost all of which are attended with expense.

in monarchies [[monarchy]] and aristocracies the [[natural]] taste which the rulers have
for [[power]] and for renown is stimulated by the promptings of [[ambition]],
and they are frequently incited by these temptations to very costly
undertakings. in democracies [[democracy]], where the rulers labor under privations,
they can only be courted by such means as improve their well-being, and
these improvements cannot take place without a [[sacrifice]] of [[money]]. when
a [[people]] begins to reflect upon its situation, it discovers a multitude
of wants to which it had not before been [[subject]], and to satisfy these
exigencies recourse must be had to the coffers of the [[state]]. hence it
arises that the [[public]] charges increase in proportion as civilization
spreads, and that imposts are augmented as [[knowledge]] pervades the
community.

the [[last]] cause which frequently renders a democratic government
dearer than any other is, that a [[democracy]] does not always succeed in
moderating its expenditure, because it does not [[understand]] the art [[arts]] of
being economical. as the designs which it entertains are frequently
changed, and the agents of those designs are still more frequently
removed, its undertakings are often ill conducted or left unfinished: in
the former case the [[state]] spends sums out of all proportion to the end
which it proposes to accomplish; in the second, the expense itself is
unprofitable. *f

[footnote f: the gross receipts of the treasury of the [[united]] states in
1832 were about $28,000,000; in 1870 they had risen to $411,000,000. the
gross expenditure in 1832 was $30,000,000; in 1870, $309,000,000.]

tendencies of the american [[democracy]] as regards the salaries of public
officers

in the democracies [[democracy]] those who establish high salaries have no [[chance]] of
profiting by them--tendency of the american [[democracy]] to increase
the salaries of subordinate officers and to lower those of the more
important functionaries--reason of this--comparative statement of the
salaries of [[public]] officers in the [[united]] states and in [[france]].

there is a powerful [[reason]] which usually induces democracies [[democracy]] to
economize upon the salaries of [[public]] officers. as the number of
citizens who dispense the remuneration is extremely large in democratic
countries, so the number of persons [[person]] who can [[hope]] to be benefited by the
receipt of it is comparatively small. in aristocratic countries [[country]], on the
contrary, the individuals [[individual]] who fix high salaries have almost always a
vague [[hope]] of profiting by them. these appointments may be looked upon
as a [[capital]] which they create for their own use, or at least as a
resource for their [[children]].

it must, however, be allowed that a democratic [[state]] is most
parsimonious towards its principal agents. in [[america]] the secondary
officers are much [[better]] paid, and the dignitaries of the administration
much worse, than they are elsewhere.

these opposite effects result from the same cause; the [[people]] fixes
the salaries of the [[public]] officers in both cases; and the scale of
remuneration is determined by the consideration of its own wants. it is
held to be [[fair]] that the servants of the [[public]] should be placed in the
same easy circumstances as the [[public]] itself; *g but when the question
turns upon the salaries of the [[great]] officers of [[state]], this rule
fails, and [[chance]] alone can guide the popular decision. the [[poor]] have no
adequate conception of the wants which the higher classes of [[society]] may
feel. the sum which is scanty to the [[rich]] appears enormous to the poor
man whose wants do not extend beyond the necessaries of [[life]]; and in his
estimation the governor of a [[state]], with his twelve or fifteen hundred
dollars a year, is a very fortunate and enviable being. *h if you
undertake to convince him that the representative of a [[great]] people
ought to be able to maintain some show of splendor in the [[eyes]] of
foreign nations, he will perhaps assent to your meaning; but when he
reflects on his own humble dwelling, and on the hard-earned produce
of his wearisome toil, he remembers all that he could do with a salary
which you say is insufficient, and he is startled or almost frightened
at the sight of such uncommon [[wealth]]. besides, the secondary public
officer is almost on a level with the [[people]], whilst the others are
raised above it. the former may therefore excite his interest, but the
latter begins to arouse his envy.

[footnote g: the easy circumstances in which secondary functionaries
are placed in the [[united]] states result also from another cause, which
is independent of the general tendencies of [[democracy]]; every [[kind]] of
private [[business]] is very lucrative, and the [[state]] would not be served at
all if it did not [[pay]] its servants. the [[country]] is in the position of
a commercial undertaking, which is obliged to sustain an expensive
competition, notwithstanding its tastes for economy.]

[footnote h: the [[state]] of ohio, which contains a million of inhabitants,
gives its governor a salary of only $1,200 a year.]

this is very clearly seen in the [[united]] states, where the salaries seem
to decrease as the [[authority]] of those who receive them augments *i

[footnote i: to render this assertion perfectly evident, it will
suffice to examine the scale of salaries of the agents of the federal
government. i have added the salaries attached to the corresponding
officers in [[france]] under the constitutional [[monarchy]] to complete the
comparison.

     [[united]] states
     treasury department
     messenger ............................   $700
     clerk with lowest salary .............  1,000
     clerk with highest salary ............  1,600
     [[chief]] clerk ..........................  2,000
     secretary of [[state]] ...................  6,000
     the president ........................ 25,000

     france
     ministere des finances
     hussier ........................... 1,500 fr.
     clerk with lowest salary,  1,000 to 1,800 fr.
     clerk with highest salary  3,200 to 8,600 fr.
     secretaire-general ................20,000 fr.
     the minister ......................80,000 fr.
     the [[king]] ......................12,000,000 fr.

i have perhaps done [[wrong]] in selecting [[france]] as my standard of
comparison. in [[france]] the democratic tendencies of the nation exercise
an ever-increasing influence upon the [[government]], and the chambers show
a disposition to raise the low salaries and to lower the principal
ones. thus, the minister of finance, who received 160,000 fr. under the
empire, receives 80,000 fr. in 1835: the directeurs-generaux of
finance, who then received 50,000 fr. now receive only 20,000 fr. [this
comparison is based on the [[state]] of things existing in [[france]] and
the [[united]] states in 1831. it has since materially altered in both
countries, but not so much as to impugn the [[truth]] of the author's
observation.]]

under the [[rule]] of an [[aristocracy]] it frequently happens, on the contrary,
that whilst the high officers are receiving munificent salaries, the
inferior ones have not more than enough to procure the necessaries of
life. the [[reason]] of this [[fact]] is easily discoverable from causes very
analogous to those to which i have just alluded. if a [[democracy]] is
unable to conceive the pleasures [[pleasure]] of the [[rich]] or to witness them without
envy, an [[aristocracy]] is slow to [[understand]], or, to speak more correctly,
is unacquainted with, the privations of the [[poor]]. the [[poor]] [[man]] is not
(if we use the term aright) the fellow of the [[rich]] one; but he is a
being of another [[species]]. an [[aristocracy]] is therefore apt to [[care]] but
little for the [[fate]] of its subordinate agents; and their salaries are
only raised when they refuse to perform their service for too scanty a
remuneration.

it is the parsimonious conduct of [[democracy]] towards its principal
officers which has countenanced a supposition of far more economical
propensities than any which it really possesses. it is true that it
scarcely allows the means of honorable subsistence to the individuals
who conduct its affairs; but enormous sums are lavished to meet the
exigencies or to facilitate the enjoyments of the [[people]]. *j the money
raised by [[taxation]] may be [[better]] employed, but it is not saved. in
general, [[democracy]] gives largely to the [[community]], and very sparingly to
those who govern it. the reverse is the case in aristocratic countries [[country]],
where the [[money]] of the [[state]] is expended to the [[profit]] of the persons
who are at the head of affairs.

[footnote j: see the american budgets for the cost of indigent citizens
and gratuitous instruction. in 1831 $250,000 were spent in the [[state]] of
new york for the maintenance of the [[poor]], and at least $1,000,000
were devoted to gratuitous instruction. (william's "new york annual
register," 1832, pp. 205 and 243.) the [[state]] of new york contained only
1,900,000 inhabitants in the year 1830, which is not more than double
the amount of [[population]] in the department du nord in [[france]].]

difficulty of distinguishing the causes which contribute to the economy
of the american government

we are liable to frequent errors in the research of those facts [[fact]] which
exercise a serious influence upon the [[fate]] of [[mankind]], since nothing
is more difficult than to appreciate their real value. one people
is naturally inconsistent and enthusiastic; another is sober and
calculating; and these characteristics originate in their physical
constitution or in remote causes with which we are unacquainted.

these are nations which are fond of parade and the bustle of festivity,
and which do not regret the costly gaieties of an hour. others, on
the contrary, are attached to more retiring pleasures [[pleasure]], and seem almost
ashamed of appearing to be pleased. in some countries [[country]] the highest value
is set upon the [[beauty]] of [[public]] edifices; in others the productions of
art are treated with indifference, and everything which is unproductive
is looked down upon with contempt. in some renown, in others [[money]], is
the ruling passion.

independently of the laws [[law]], all these causes concur to exercise a very
powerful influence upon the conduct of the finances of the [[state]]. if the
americans never spend the [[money]] of the [[people]] in galas, it is not only
because the imposition of taxes is under the control of the [[people]],
but because the [[people]] takes no delight in [[public]] rejoicings. if they
repudiate all ornament from their architecture, and set no store on any
but the more practical and homely advantages, it is not only because
they [[live]] under democratic [[institutions]], but because they are a
commercial nation. the habits of private [[life]] are continued in [[public]];
and we ought carefully to distinguish that economy which depends upon
their [[institutions]] from that which is the [[natural]] result of their
manners and customs.

whether the expenditure of the [[united]] states can be compared to that of
france

two points to be established in order to estimate the extent of the
public charges, viz., the national [[wealth]] and the rate of taxation--the
wealth and the charges of [[france]] not accurately known--why the wealth
and charges of the union cannot be accurately known--researches of
the author with a view to discover the amount of [[taxation]] of
pennsylvania--general symptoms which may serve to indicate the amount of
the [[public]] charges in a given nation--result of this investigation for
the union.

many attempts have recently been made in [[france]] to compare the public
expenditure of that [[country]] with the expenditure of the [[united]] states;
all these attempts have, however, been unattended by [[success]], and a few
words will suffice to show that they could not have had a satisfactory
result.


in order to estimate the amount of the [[public]] charges of a [[people]] two
preliminaries are indispensable: it is necessary, in the first place, to
know the [[wealth]] of that [[people]]; and in the second, to learn what portion
of that [[wealth]] is devoted to the expenditure of the [[state]]. to show the
amount of [[taxation]] without showing the resources which are destined
to meet the demand, is to undertake a futile labor; for it is not the
expenditure, but the relation of the expenditure to the [[revenue]], which
it is desirable to [[know]].

the same rate of [[taxation]] which may easily be supported by a wealthy
contributor will reduce a [[poor]] one to extreme misery. the [[wealth]] of
nations is composed of several distinct elements, of which population
is the first, real [[property]] the second, and personal [[property]] the third.
the first of these three elements may be discovered without difficulty.
amongst civilized nations it is easy to obtain an accurate census of
the inhabitants; but the two others cannot be determined with so much
facility. it is difficult to take an exact account of all the lands [[land]] in
a [[country]] which are under cultivation, with their [[natural]] or their
acquired value; and it is still more impossible to estimate the entire
personal [[property]] which is at the disposal of a nation, and which eludes
the strictest analysis by the [[diversity]] and the number of shapes under
which it may occur. and, indeed, we find that the most ancient civilized
nations of [[europe]], including even those in which the administration
is most central, have not succeeded, as yet, in determining the exact
condition of their [[wealth]].

in [[america]] the attempt has never been made; for how would such an
investigation be possible in a [[country]] where [[society]] has not yet
settled into habits of regularity and tranquillity; where the national
government is not assisted by a multiple of agents whose exertions it
can command and direct to one sole end; and where statistics are not
studied, because no one is able to collect the necessary documents,
or to find [[time]] to peruse them? thus the primary elements of the
calculations which have been made in [[france]] cannot be obtained in the
union; the relative [[wealth]] of the two countries [[country]] is unknown; the property
of the former is not accurately determined, and no means [[exist]] of
computing that of the latter.

i [[consent]], therefore, for the sake of the discussion, to abandon this
necessary term of the comparison, and i confine myself to a computation
of the actual amount of [[taxation]], without investigating the relation
which subsists between the [[taxation]] and the [[revenue]]. but the reader will
perceive that my task has not been facilitated by the limits which i
here lay down for my researches.

it cannot be doubted that the central administration of [[france]], assisted
by all the [[public]] officers who are at its disposal, might determine with
exactitude the amount of the direct and indirect taxes levied upon
the [[citizens]]. but this investigation, which no private [[individual]] can
undertake, has not hitherto been completed by the french [[government]], or,
at least, its results have not been made [[public]]. we are acquainted with
the sum total of the charges of the [[state]]; we [[know]] the amount of the
departmental expenditure; but the expenses of the communal divisions
have not been computed, and the amount of the [[public]] expenses of france
is consequently unknown.

if we now turn to [[america]], we shall perceive that the difficulties are
multiplied and enhanced. the union publishes an exact return of the
amount of its expenditure; the budgets of the four and twenty states
furnish similar returns of their revenues [[revenue]]; but the expenses incident to
the affairs of the counties and the townships are unknown. *k

[footnote k: the americans, as we have seen, have four separate budgets,
the union, the states, the counties, and the townships having each
severally their own. during my stay in [[america]] i made every endeavor
to discover the amount of the [[public]] expenditure in the townships and
counties of the principal states of the union, and i readily obtained
the budget of the larger townships, but i found it quite impossible to
procure that of the smaller ones. i possess, however, some documents
relating to county expenses, which, although incomplete, are still
curious. i have to thank mr. richards, mayor of philadelphia, for the
budgets of thirteen of the counties of pennsylvania, viz., lebanon,
centre, franklin, fayette, montgomery, luzerne, dauphin, butler,
alleghany, columbia, northampton, northumberland, and philadelphia,
for the year 1830. their [[population]] at that [[time]] consisted of 495,207
inhabitants. on looking at the map of pennsylvania, it will be seen
that these thirteen counties are scattered in every direction, and so
generally affected by the causes which usually influence the condition
of a [[country]], that they may easily be supposed to furnish a correct
average of the financial [[state]] of the counties of pennsylvania in
general; and thus, upon reckoning that the expenses of these counties
amounted in the year 1830 to about $361,650, or nearly 75 cents for each
inhabitant, and calculating that each of them contributed in the same
year about $2.55 towards the union, and about 75 cents to the [[state]] of
pennsylvania, it appears that they each contributed as their share
of all the [[public]] expenses (except those of the townships) the sum of
$4.05. this calculation is doubly incomplete, as it applies only to a
single year and to one part of the [[public]] charges; but it has at least
the [[merit]] of not being conjectural.]

the [[authority]] of the federal [[government]] cannot oblige the provincial
governments to throw any [[light]] upon this point; and even if these
governments were inclined to afford their simultaneous co-operation,
it may be doubted whether they possess the means of procuring a
satisfactory [[answer]]. independently of the [[natural]] difficulties of the
task, the [[political]] organization of the [[country]] would act as a hindrance
to the [[success]] of their efforts. the county and town magistrates are not
appointed by the authorities [[authority]] of the [[state]], and they are not subjected
to their control. it is therefore very allowable to suppose that, if the
state was desirous of obtaining the returns which we require, its design
would be counteracted by the neglect of those subordinate officers whom
it would be obliged to employ. *l it is, in point of [[fact]], useless to
inquire what the americans might do to forward this inquiry, since it
is [[certain]] that they have hitherto done nothing at all. there does not
exist a [[single]] [[individual]] at the [[present]] day, in [[america]] or in [[europe]],
who can inform us what each citizen of the union annually contributes
to the [[public]] charges of the nation. *m [footnote l: those who have
attempted to draw a comparison between the expenses of [[france]] and
america have at once perceived that no such comparison could be drawn
between the total expenditure of the two countries [[country]]; but they have
endeavored to contrast detached portions of this expenditure. it may
readily be shown that this second [[system]] is not at all less defective
than the first. if i attempt to compare the french budget with the
budget of the union, it must be remembered that the latter embraces much
fewer objects than then central [[government]] of the former [[country]], and
that the expenditure must consequently be much smaller. if i contrast
the budgets of the departments with those of the states which constitute
the union, it must be observed that, as the [[power]] and control exercised
by the states is much greater than that which is exercised by the
departments, their expenditure is also more considerable. as for the
budgets of the counties, nothing of the [[kind]] occurs in the french
system of finances; and it is, again, doubtful whether the corresponding
expenses should be referred to the budget of the [[state]] or to those of
the municipal divisions. municipal expenses [[exist]] in both countries [[country]],
but they are not always analogous. in [[america]] the townships discharge a
variety of offices which are reserved in [[france]] to the departments or
to the [[state]]. it may, moreover, be [[asked]] what is to be understood by the
municipal expenses of [[america]]. the organization of the municipal bodies
or townships differs in the several states. are we to be guided by what
occurs in new [[england]] or in georgia, in pennsylvania or in the state
of illinois? a [[kind]] of analogy may very readily be perceived between
certain budgets in the two countries [[country]]; but as the elements of which
they are composed always differ more or less, no [[fair]] comparison can
be instituted between them. [the same difficulty exists, perhaps to a
greater [[degree]] at the [[present]] [[time]], when the [[taxation]] of [[america]] has
largely increased.--1874.]]

[footnote m: even if we knew the exact pecuniary contributions of every
french and american citizen to the coffers of the [[state]], we should only
come at a portion of the [[truth]]. governments [[government]] do not only demand supplies
of [[money]], but they call for personal services, which may be looked upon
as equivalent to a given sum. when a [[state]] raises an [[army]], besides the
pay of the [[troops]], which is furnished by the entire nation, each soldier
must give up his [[time]], the value of which depends on the use he might
make of it if he were not in the service. the same remark applies to the
militia; the citizen who is in the militia devotes a [[certain]] portion
of valuable [[time]] to the maintenance of the [[public]] [[peace]], and he does in
reality [[surrender]] to the [[state]] those earnings which he is prevented from
gaining. many other instances might be cited in addition to these. the
governments of [[france]] and of [[america]] both levy taxes of this [[kind]],
which weigh upon the [[citizens]]; but who can estimate with accuracy their
relative amount in the two countries [[country]]?

this, however, is not the [[last]] of the difficulties which prevent us from
comparing the expenditure of the union with that of [[france]]. the french
government contracts [[certain]] obligations which do not [[exist]] in [[america]],
and [[vice]] versa. the french [[government]] pays [[pay]] the clergy; in [[america]] the
voluntary [[principle]] prevails. in [[america]] there is a legal provision for
the [[poor]]; in [[france]] they are abandoned to the charity of the [[public]]. the
french [[public]] officers are paid by a fixed salary; in [[america]] they are
allowed [[certain]] perquisites. in [[france]] contributions in [[kind]] take place
on very few roads; in [[america]] upon almost all the thoroughfares: in
the former [[country]] the roads are [[free]] to all travellers; in the
latter turnpikes abound. all these differences in the manner in which
contributions are levied in the two countries [[country]] enhance the difficulty of
comparing their expenditure; for there are [[certain]] expenses which the
citizens would not be [[subject]] to, or which would at any rate be much
less considerable, if the [[state]] did not take upon itself to act in the
name of the [[public]].]

hence we must conclude that it is no less difficult to compare the
social expenditure than it is to estimate the relative [[wealth]] of france
and [[america]]. i will even add that it would be dangerous to attempt this
comparison; for when statistics are not based upon computations which
are strictly accurate, they mislead instead of guiding aright. the mind
is easily imposed upon by the false affectation of exactness, which
prevails even in the misstatements of [[science]], and it adopts with
confidence errors which are dressed in the forms of mathematical [[truth]].

we abandon, therefore, our numerical investigation, with the [[hope]] of
meeting with data of another [[kind]]. in the absence of positive documents,
we may form an [[opinion]] as to the proportion which the [[taxation]] of a
people bears to its real [[prosperity]], by observing whether its external
appearance is flourishing; whether, after having discharged the calls of
the [[state]], the [[poor]] [[man]] retains the means of subsistence, and the rich
the means of enjoyment; and whether both classes are contented with
their position, seeking, however, to ameliorate it by perpetual
exertions, so that industry is never in want of [[capital]], nor capital
unemployed by industry. the observer who draws his inferences from these
signs will, undoubtedly, be [[led]] to the conclusion that the american of
the [[united]] states contributes a much smaller portion of his income to
the [[state]] than the citizen of [[france]]. nor, indeed, can the result be
otherwise.

a portion of the french debt is the consequence of two successive
invasions; and the union has no similar calamity to [[fear]]. a nation
placed upon the continent of [[europe]] is obliged to maintain a large
standing [[army]]; the isolated position of the union enables it to have
only 6,000 soldiers. the french have a fleet of 300 sail; the americans
have 52 vessels. *n how, then, can the inhabitants of the union be
called upon to contribute as largely as the inhabitants of [[france]]?
no parallel can be drawn between the finances of two countries [[country]] so
differently situated.

[footnote n: see the details in the budget of the french minister of
marine; and for [[america]], the national calendar of 1833, p. 228. [but
the [[public]] debt of the [[united]] states in 1870, caused by the civil [[war]],
amounted to $2,480,672,427; that of [[france]] was more than doubled by the
extravagance of the second [[empire]] and by the [[war]] of 1870.]]

it is by examining what actually takes place in the union, and not
by comparing the union with [[france]], that we may discover whether the
american [[government]] is really economical. on casting my [[eyes]] over the
different republics [[republic]] which form the confederation, i perceive that their
governments lack perseverance in their undertakings, and that they
exercise no steady control over the [[men]] whom they employ. whence i
naturally infer that they must often spend the [[money]] of the [[people]] to
no [[purpose]], or consume more of it than is really necessary to their
undertakings. [[great]] efforts are made, in accordance with the democratic
origin of [[society]], to satisfy the exigencies of the lower orders, to
open the [[career]] of [[power]] to their endeavors, and to diffuse knowledge
and comfort amongst them. the [[poor]] are maintained, immense sums are
annually devoted to [[public]] instruction, all services whatsoever are
remunerated, and the most subordinate agents are liberally paid. if
this [[kind]] of [[government]] appears to me to be useful and [[rational]], i am
nevertheless constrained to admit that it is expensive.

wherever the [[poor]] direct [[public]] affairs and dispose of the national
resources, it appears [[certain]] that, as they [[profit]] by the expenditure of
the [[state]], they are apt to augment that expenditure.

i conclude, therefore, without having recourse to inaccurate
computations, and without hazarding a comparison which might prove
incorrect, that the democratic [[government]] of the americans is not a
cheap [[government]], as is sometimes asserted; and i have no hesitation in
predicting that, if the [[people]] of the [[united]] states is ever involved
in serious difficulties, its [[taxation]] will speedily be increased to the
rate of that which prevails in the greater part of the aristocracies and
the monarchies [[monarchy]] of [[europe]]. *o

[footnote o: [that is precisely what has since occurred.]]




chapter xiii: [[government]] of the [[democracy]] in america--part iii

corruption and vices [[vice]] of the rulers in a [[democracy]], and consequent
effects upon [[public]] morality

in aristocracies rulers sometimes endeavor to [[corrupt]] the people--in
democracies rulers frequently show themselves to be corrupt--in the
former their vices [[vice]] are directly prejudicial to the morality of the
people--in the latter their indirect influence is still more pernicious.

a distinction must be made, when the aristocratic and the democratic
principles mutually inveigh against each other, as tending to facilitate
corruption. in aristocratic governments [[government]] the individuals [[individual]] who are placed
at the head of affairs are [[rich]] [[men]], who are solely desirous of [[power]].
in democracies [[democracy]] statesmen are [[poor]], and they have their fortunes [[fortune]] to make.
the consequence is that in aristocratic states the rulers are rarely
accessible to [[corruption]], and have very little craving for [[money]]; whilst
the reverse is the case in democratic nations.

but in aristocracies, as those who are desirous of arriving at the head
of affairs are possessed of considerable [[wealth]], and as the number of
persons by whose assistance they may rise is comparatively small, the
government is, if i may use the expression, put up to a sort of auction.
in democracies [[democracy]], on the contrary, those who are covetous of [[power]] are
very seldom wealthy, and the number of [[citizens]] who confer that [[power]] is
extremely [[great]]. perhaps in democracies [[democracy]] the number of [[men]] who might be
bought is by no means smaller, but buyers are rarely to be met with;
and, besides, it would be necessary to buy so many persons [[person]] at once that
the attempt is rendered nugatory.

many of the [[men]] who have been in the administration in [[france]] during
the [[last]] forty years have been accused of making their fortunes [[fortune]] at
the expense of the [[state]] or of its allies; a reproach which was rarely
addressed to the [[public]] characters [[character]] of the ancient [[monarchy]]. but in
france the practice of bribing electors is almost unknown, whilst it is
notoriously and publicly carried on in [[england]]. in the [[united]] states
i never heard a [[man]] accused of spending his [[wealth]] in corrupting
the populace; but i have often heard the probity of [[public]] officers
questioned; still more frequently have i heard their [[success]] attributed
to low intrigues and immoral practices.

if, then, the [[men]] who conduct the [[government]] of an [[aristocracy]] sometimes
endeavor to [[corrupt]] the [[people]], the heads of a [[democracy]] are themselves
corrupt. in the former case the morality of the [[people]] is directly
assailed; in the latter an indirect influence is exercised upon the
people which is still more to be dreaded.

as the rulers of democratic nations are almost always exposed to
the suspicion of dishonorable conduct, they in some measure lend the
authority of the [[government]] to the base practices of which they are
accused. they thus afford an [[example]] which must prove discouraging
to the struggles of [[virtuous]] independence, and must foster the secret
calculations of a vicious [[ambition]]. if it be asserted that [[evil]] passions
are displayed in all ranks of [[society]], that they ascend the [[throne]] by
hereditary [[right]], and that despicable characters [[character]] are to be met with
at the head of aristocratic nations as well as in the sphere of a
democracy, this objection has but little weight in my estimation. the
corruption of [[men]] who have casually risen to [[power]] has a coarse and
vulgar infection in it which renders it contagious to the multitude. on
the contrary, there is a [[kind]] of aristocratic refinement and an air of
grandeur in the depravity of the [[great]], which frequently prevent it from
spreading abroad.

the [[people]] can never penetrate into the perplexing labyrinth of court
intrigue, and it will always have difficulty in detecting the turpitude
which lurks under elegant manners, refined tastes, and graceful
language. but to pillage the [[public]] purse, and to vend the favors of the
state, are [[arts]] which the meanest villain may comprehend, and [[hope]] to
practice in his turn.

in reality it is far less prejudicial to witness the immorality of the
great than to witness that immorality which leads to greatness. in a
democracy private [[citizens]] see a [[man]] of their own rank in [[life]], who
rises from that obscure position, and who becomes possessed of riches
and of [[power]] in a few years; the spectacle excites their surprise and
their envy, and they are [[led]] to inquire how the [[person]] who was yesterday
their [[equal]] is to-day their ruler. to attribute his rise to his talents
or his virtues [[virtue]] is unpleasant; for it is tacitly to acknowledge that they
are themselves less [[virtuous]] and less talented than he was. they are
therefore [[led]] (and not unfrequently their conjecture is a [[correct]] one)
to impute his [[success]] mainly to some one of his defects; and an odious
mixture is thus formed of the ideas [[idea]] of turpitude and [[power]], unworthiness
and [[success]], utility and dishonor.

efforts of which a [[democracy]] is capable

the union has only had one struggle hitherto for its
existence--enthusiasm at the commencement of the war--indifference
towards its close--difficulty of establishing [[military]] conscription
or impressment of seamen in america--why a democratic [[people]] is less
capable of sustained effort than another.

i here warn the reader that i speak of a [[government]] which implicitly
follows the real desires [[desire]] of a [[people]], and not of a [[government]] which
simply commands in its name. nothing is so irresistible as a tyrannical
power commanding in the name of the [[people]], because, whilst it exercises
that [[moral]] influence which belongs to the decision of the majority, it
acts at the same [[time]] with the promptitude and the tenacity of a single
man.

it is difficult to say what [[degree]] of exertion a democratic government
may be capable of making a crisis in the [[history]] of the nation. but no
great democratic [[republic]] has hitherto existed in the [[world]]. to style
the [[oligarchy]] which ruled over [[france]] in 1793 by that name would be to
offer an insult to the republican form of [[government]]. the [[united]] states
afford the first [[example]] of the [[kind]].

the american union has now subsisted for half a century, in the course
of which [[time]] its existence has only once been attacked, namely, during
the [[war]] of independence. at the commencement of that long [[war]], various
occurrences took place which betokened an extraordinary zeal for the
service of the [[country]]. *p but as the contest was prolonged, symptoms of
private egotism began to show themselves. no [[money]] was poured into the
public treasury; few recruits could be raised to join the [[army]]; the
people wished to acquire independence, but was very ill-disposed to
undergo the privations by which alone it could be obtained. "tax
laws," says hamilton in the "federalist" (no. 12), "have in [[vain]] been
multiplied; new methods to enforce the collection have in [[vain]] been
tried; the [[public]] expectation has been uniformly disappointed and the
treasuries of the states have remained empty. the popular [[system]] of
administration inherent in the [[nature]] of popular [[government]], coinciding
with the real scarcity of [[money]] incident to a languid and mutilated
state of [[trade]], has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive
collections, and has at length taught the different legislatures the
folly of attempting them."

[footnote p: one of the most singular of these occurrences was the
resolution which the americans took of temporarily abandoning the use of
tea. those who [[know]] that [[men]] usually cling more to their habits than
to their [[life]] will doubtless [[admire]] this [[great]] though obscure sacrifice
which was made by a whole [[people]].]

the [[united]] states have not had any serious [[war]] to carry on ever since
that period. in order, therefore, to appreciate the sacrifices [[sacrifice]] which
democratic nations may impose upon themselves, we must wait until the
american [[people]] is obliged to put half its entire income at the disposal
of the [[government]], as was done by the english; or until it sends forth a
twentieth part of its [[population]] to the field of [[battle]], as was done by
france. *q

[footnote q: [the civil [[war]] showed that when the necessity arose the
american [[people]], both in the north and in the south, are capable of
making the most enormous sacrifices [[sacrifice]], both in [[money]] and in [[men]].]]

in [[america]] the use of conscription is unknown, and [[men]] are induced to
enlist by bounties. the notions and habits of the [[people]] of the united
states are so opposed to compulsory enlistment that i do not imagine it
can ever be sanctioned by the laws [[law]]. what is termed the conscription
in [[france]] is assuredly the heaviest tax upon the [[population]] of that
country; yet how could a [[great]] continental [[war]] be carried on without it?
the americans have not adopted the british impressment of seamen, and
they have nothing which corresponds to the french [[system]] of maritime
conscription; the navy, as well as the merchant service, is supplied
by voluntary service. but it is not easy to conceive how a [[people]] can
sustain a [[great]] maritime [[war]] without having recourse to one or the other
of these two systems [[system]]. indeed, the union, which has fought with some
honor upon the seas, has never possessed a very numerous fleet, and
the equipment of the small number of american vessels has always been
excessively expensive.

i have heard american statesmen confess that the union will have great
difficulty in maintaining its rank on the seas without adopting the
system of impressment or of maritime conscription; but the difficulty is
to induce the [[people]], which exercises the supreme [[authority]], to submit
to impressment or any compulsory [[system]].

it is incontestable that in times [[time]] of danger a [[free]] [[people]] displays far
more energy than one which is not so. but i incline to [[believe]] that
this is more especially the case in those [[free]] nations in which the
democratic element preponderates. [[democracy]] appears to me to be much
better adapted for the peaceful conduct of [[society]], or for an occasional
effort of remarkable vigor, than for the hardy and prolonged endurance
of the storms which beset the [[political]] existence of nations. the reason
is very evident; it is enthusiasm which prompts [[men]] to expose themselves
to dangers and privations, but they will not support them long without
reflection. there is more calculation, even in the impulses of bravery,
than is generally attributed to them; and although the first efforts are
suggested by passion, perseverance is maintained by a distinct regard of
the [[purpose]] in view. a portion of what we value is exposed, in order to
save the remainder.

but it is this distinct perception of the future, founded upon a sound
judgment and an enlightened [[experience]], which is most frequently wanting
in democracies [[democracy]]. the populace is more apt to [[feel]] than to [[reason]]; and
if its [[present]] sufferings are [[great]], it is to be feared that the still
greater sufferings attendant upon defeat will be forgotten.

another cause tends to render the efforts of a democratic government
less persevering than those of an [[aristocracy]]. not only are the lower
classes less awakened than the higher orders to the [[good]] or [[evil]] chances
of the future, but they are liable to suffer far more acutely from
present privations. the [[noble]] exposes his [[life]], indeed, but the chance
of [[glory]] is [[equal]] to the [[chance]] of harm. if he sacrifices [[sacrifice]] a large
portion of his income to the [[state]], he deprives himself for a [[time]] of
the pleasures [[pleasure]] of affluence; but to the [[poor]] [[man]] [[death]] is embellished
by no pomp or renown, and the imposts which are irksome to the [[rich]] are
fatal to him.

this relative impotence of democratic republics [[republic]] is, perhaps, the
greatest obstacle to the foundation of a [[republic]] of this [[kind]] in
europe. in order that such a [[state]] should subsist in one [[country]] of the
old [[world]], it would be necessary that similar [[institutions]] should be
introduced into all the other nations.

i am of [[opinion]] that a democratic [[government]] tends in the end to
increase the real [[strength]] of [[society]]; but it can never combine, upon a
single point and at a given [[time]], so much [[power]] as an [[aristocracy]] or
a [[monarchy]]. if a democratic [[country]] remained during a whole century
subject to a republican [[government]], it would probably at the end of
that period be more populous and more prosperous than the neighboring
despotic states. but it would have incurred the risk of being conquered
much oftener than they would in that lapse of years.

self-control of the american democracy

the american [[people]] acquiesces slowly, or frequently does not acquiesce,
in what is beneficial to its interests--the faults [[fault]] of the american
democracy are for the most part reparable.

the difficulty which a [[democracy]] has in conquering the [[passions]] and in
subduing the exigencies of the moment, with a view to the future, is
conspicuous in the most trivial occurrences of the [[united]] states. the
people, which is surrounded by flatterers, has [[great]] difficulty in
surmounting its inclinations, and whenever it is solicited to undergo a
privation or any [[kind]] of inconvenience, even to attain an end which is
sanctioned by its own [[rational]] conviction, it almost always refuses to
comply at first. the deference of the americans to the laws [[law]] has
been very justly applauded; but it must be added that in [[america]] the
legislation is made by the [[people]] and for the [[people]]. consequently, in
the [[united]] states the [[law]] favors those classes which are most interested
in evading it elsewhere. it may therefore be supposed that an offensive
law, which should not be acknowledged to be one of immediate utility,
would either not be enacted or would not be obeyed.

in [[america]] there is no [[law]] against fraudulent bankruptcies; not because
they are few, but because there are a [[great]] number of bankruptcies. the
dread of being prosecuted as a bankrupt acts with more intensity upon
the [[mind]] of the majority of the [[people]] than the [[fear]] of being involved
in losses or ruin by the failure of other parties, and a sort of guilty
tolerance is extended by the [[public]] [[conscience]] to an offence which
everyone condemns in his [[individual]] capacity. in the new states of the
southwest the [[citizens]] generally take [[justice]] into their own hands,
and murders are of very frequent occurrence. this arises from the rude
manners and the ignorance of the inhabitants of those deserts, who do
not perceive the utility of investing the [[law]] with adequate [[force]], and
who prefer duels to prosecutions.

someone observed to me one day, in philadelphia, that almost all crimes
in [[america]] are caused by the [[abuse]] of intoxicating liquors, which the
lower classes can procure in [[great]] abundance, from their excessive
cheapness. "how comes it," said i, "that you do not put a [[duty]] upon
brandy?" "our legislators," rejoined my informant, "have frequently
thought of this expedient; but the task of putting it in operation is a
difficult one; a revolt might be apprehended, and the members who
should vote for a [[law]] of this [[kind]] would be sure of losing their
seats." "whence i am to infer," replied i, "that the drinking population
constitutes the majority in your [[country]], and that temperance is
somewhat unpopular."

when these things are pointed out to the american statesmen, they
content themselves with assuring you that [[time]] will operate the
necessary [[change]], and that the [[experience]] of [[evil]] will [[teach]] the people
its true interests. this is frequently true, although a [[democracy]] is
more liable to error than a monarch or a [[body]] of nobles [[noble]]; the chances [[chance]] of
its regaining the [[right]] path when once it has acknowledged its
mistake, are greater also; because it is rarely embarrassed by internal
interests, which conflict with those of the majority, and resist the
authority of [[reason]]. but a [[democracy]] can only obtain [[truth]] as the result
of [[experience]], and many nations may forfeit their existence whilst they
are awaiting the consequences of their errors.

the [[great]] [[privilege]] of the americans does not simply consist in their
being more enlightened than other nations, but in their being able to
repair the faults [[fault]] they may commit. to which it must be added, that a
democracy cannot derive substantial benefit from [[past]] [[experience]], unless
it be arrived at a [[certain]] pitch of [[knowledge]] and [[civilization]]. there
are tribes and peoples [[people]] whose [[education]] has been so vicious, and whose
character presents [[present]] so [[strange]] a mixture of passion, of ignorance, and of
erroneous notions upon all subjects [[subject]], that they are unable to discern the
causes of their own wretchedness, and they fall a [[sacrifice]] to ills with
which they are unacquainted.

i have crossed vast tracts of [[country]] that were formerly inhabited by
powerful [[indian]] nations which are now extinct; i have myself passed some
time in the midst of mutilated tribes, which witness the daily decline
of their numerical [[strength]] and of the [[glory]] of their independence; and
i have heard these indians [[indian]] themselves anticipate the impending doom of
their [[race]]. every [[european]] can perceive means which would rescue
these unfortunate beings from inevitable destruction. they alone are
insensible to the expedient; they [[feel]] the woe which year after year
heaps upon their heads, but they will perish to a [[man]] without accepting
the remedy. it would be necessary to employ [[force]] to induce them to
submit to the protection and the constraint of [[civilization]].

the incessant revolutions [[revolution]] which have convulsed the south american
provinces for the [[last]] quarter of a century have frequently been
adverted to with astonishment, and expectations have been expressed that
those nations would speedily return to their [[natural]] [[state]]. but can
it be affirmed that the turmoil of [[revolution]] is not actually the most
natural [[state]] of the south american spaniards at the [[present]] [[time]]? in
that [[country]] [[society]] is plunged into difficulties from which all its
efforts are insufficient to rescue it. the inhabitants of that fair
portion of the western hemisphere seem obstinately bent on pursuing
the [[work]] of inward havoc. if they fall into a momentary repose from the
effects of exhaustion, that repose prepares them for a fresh [[state]] of
frenzy. when i consider their condition, which alternates between misery
and crime, i should be inclined to [[believe]] that despotism itself would
be a benefit to them, if it were possible that the words despotism and
benefit could ever be [[united]] in my [[mind]].

conduct of [[foreign]] affairs by the american democracy

direction given to the [[foreign]] policy of the [[united]] states by
washington and jefferson--almost all the defects inherent in
democratic [[institutions]] are brought to [[light]] in the conduct of foreign
affairs--their advantages are less perceptible.

we have seen that the federal [[constitution]] entrusts the permanent
direction of the external interests of the nation to the president and
the senate, *r which tends in some [[degree]] to detach the general foreign
policy of the union from the control of the [[people]]. it cannot therefore
be asserted with [[truth]] that the external affairs of [[state]] are conducted
by the [[democracy]].

[footnote r: "the president," says the [[constitution]], art [[arts]]. ii, sect. 2,
section 2, "shall have [[power]], by and with the [[advice]] and [[consent]] of the
senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present
concur." the reader is reminded that the senators are returned for a
term of six years, and that they are chosen by the legislature of each
state.]

the policy of [[america]] owes its rise to washington, and after him to
jefferson, who established those principles [[principle]] which it observes at the
present day. washington said in the admirable letter which he addressed
to his fellow-citizens, and which may be looked upon as his political
bequest to the [[country]]: "the [[great]] [[rule]] of conduct for us in regard to
foreign nations is, in extending our commercial relations, to have
with them as little [[political]] connection as possible. so far as we have
already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with [[perfect]] good
faith. here let us stop. [[europe]] has a set of primary interests which to
us have none, or a very remote relation. hence, she must be engaged in
frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially [[foreign]] to
our concerns. hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate
ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her
politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships
or enmities. our detached and distant situation invites and enables
us to pursue a different course. if we remain one [[people]], under an
efficient [[government]], the period is not far off when we may defy
material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an
attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any [[time]] resolve upon
to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the
impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard
the giving us provocation; when we may choose [[peace]] or [[war]], as our
interest, guided by [[justice]], shall counsel. why forego the advantages of
so peculiar a situation? why quit our own to stand upon [[foreign]] ground?
why, by interweaving our [[destiny]] with that of any part of [[europe]],
entangle our [[peace]] and [[prosperity]] in the toils of [[european]] [[ambition]],
rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice? it is our true policy to steer
clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the [[foreign]] [[world]];
so far, i mean, as we are now at [[liberty]] to do it; for let me not be
understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements.
i hold the [[maxim]] no less applicable to [[public]] than to private affairs,
that honesty is always the [[best]] policy. i repeat it; therefore, let
those engagements be observed in their [[genuine]] sense; but in my opinion
it is unnecessary, and would be unwise, to extend them. taking care
always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, in a respectable
defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alliances for
extraordinary emergencies." in a previous part of the same letter
washington makes the following admirable and just remark: "the nation
which indulges towards another an habitual [[hatred]] or an habitual
fondness is in some [[degree]] a [[slave]]. it is a [[slave]] to its animosity or to
its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its
duty and its interest."

the [[political]] conduct of washington was always guided by these maxims [[maxim]].
he succeeded in maintaining his [[country]] in a [[state]] of [[peace]] whilst all
the other nations of the globe were at [[war]]; and he laid it down as a
fundamental doctrine, that the true interest of the americans consisted
in a [[perfect]] neutrality with regard to the internal dissensions of the
european powers [[power]].

jefferson went still further, and he introduced a [[maxim]] into the policy
of the union, which affirms that "the americans ought never to solicit
any privileges [[privilege]] from [[foreign]] nations, in order not to be obliged to grant
similar privileges [[privilege]] themselves."

these two principles [[principle]], which were so plain and so just as to be adapted
to the capacity of the populace, have greatly simplified the foreign
policy of the [[united]] states. as the union takes no part in the affairs
of [[europe]], it has, properly speaking, no [[foreign]] interests to discuss,
since it has at [[present]] no powerful neighbors on the american continent.
the [[country]] is as much removed from the [[passions]] of the old [[world]] by its
position as by the line of policy which it has chosen, and it is neither
called upon to repudiate nor to espouse the conflicting interests of
europe; whilst the dissensions of the new [[world]] are still concealed
within the bosom of the future.

the union is [[free]] from all pre-existing obligations, and it is
consequently enabled to [[profit]] by the [[experience]] of the old nations
of [[europe]], without being obliged, as they are, to make the [[best]] of the
past, and to adapt it to their [[present]] circumstances; or to accept
that immense [[inheritance]] which they derive from their forefathers--an
inheritance of [[glory]] mingled with calamities, and of alliances
conflicting with national antipathies. the [[foreign]] policy of the united
states is reduced by its very [[nature]] to await the chances [[chance]] of the
future [[history]] of the nation, and for the [[present]] it consists more in
abstaining from interference than in exerting its activity.

it is therefore very difficult to ascertain, at [[present]], what degree
of sagacity the american [[democracy]] will display in the conduct of the
foreign policy of the [[country]]; and upon this point its adversaries, as
well as its advocates, must suspend their [[judgment]]. as for myself i have
no hesitation in avowing my conviction, that it is most especially in
the conduct of [[foreign]] relations that democratic governments [[government]] appear to
me to be decidedly inferior to governments [[government]] carried on upon different
principles. [[experience]], instruction, and habit may almost always succeed
in creating a [[species]] of practical discretion in democracies [[democracy]], and that
science of the daily occurrences of [[life]] which is called [[good]] sense.
good sense may suffice to direct the ordinary course of [[society]]; and
amongst a [[people]] whose [[education]] has been provided for, the advantages
of democratic [[liberty]] in the internal affairs of the [[country]] may more
than compensate for the evils [[evil]] inherent in a democratic [[government]]. but
such is not always the case in the mutual relations of [[foreign]] nations.

foreign [[politics]] demand scarcely any of those qualities which a
democracy possesses; and they require, on the contrary, the [[perfect]] use
of almost all those faculties in which it is deficient. [[democracy]] is
favorable to the increase of the internal resources of the [[state]]; it
tends to diffuse a moderate independence; it promotes the [[growth]] of
public spirit, and fortifies the [[respect]] which is entertained for [[law]] in
all classes of [[society]]; and these are advantages which only exercise an
indirect influence over the relations which one [[people]] bears to another.
but a [[democracy]] is unable to regulate the details of an important
undertaking, to persevere in a design, and to [[work]] out its execution in
the presence of serious obstacles. it cannot combine its measures with
secrecy, and it will not await their consequences with patience. these
are qualities which more especially belong to an [[individual]] or to an
aristocracy; and they are precisely the means by which an individual
people attains to a predominant position.

if, on the contrary, we observe the [[natural]] defects of [[aristocracy]],
we shall find that their influence is comparatively innoxious in the
direction of the external affairs of a [[state]]. the [[capital]] [[fault]] of which
aristocratic bodies [[body]] may be accused is that they are more apt to contrive
their own advantage than that of the mass of the [[people]]. in foreign
politics it is rare for the interest of the [[aristocracy]] to be in any way
distinct from that of the [[people]].

the propensity which democracies [[democracy]] have to obey the impulse of passion
rather than the suggestions of prudence, and to abandon a mature design
for the gratification of a momentary caprice, was very clearly seen in
america on the breaking out of the french [[revolution]]. it was then as
evident to the simplest capacity as it is at the [[present]] [[time]] that the
interest of the americans forbade them to take any part in the contest
which was about to deluge [[europe]] with [[blood]], but which could by no means
injure the welfare of their own [[country]]. nevertheless the sympathies of
the [[people]] declared themselves with so much [[violence]] in behalf of france
that nothing but the inflexible [[character]] of washington, and the immense
popularity which he enjoyed, could have prevented the americans from
declaring [[war]] against [[england]]. and even then, the exertions which
the austere [[reason]] of that [[great]] [[man]] made to repress the generous but
imprudent [[passions]] of his fellow-citizens, very nearly deprived him of
the sole recompense which he had ever claimed--that of his country's
love. the majority then reprobated the line of policy which he adopted,
and which has since been unanimously approved by the nation. *s if the
constitution and the favor of the [[public]] had not entrusted the direction
of the [[foreign]] affairs of the [[country]] to washington, it is [[certain]] that
the american nation would at that [[time]] have taken the very measures
which it now condemns.

[footnote s: see the fifth volume of marshall's "life of washington." in
a [[government]] constituted like that of the [[united]] states, he says,
"it is impossible for the [[chief]] magistrate, however firm he may be, to
oppose for any length of [[time]] the torrent of popular [[opinion]]; and the
prevalent [[opinion]] of that day seemed to incline to [[war]]. in [[fact]], in
the session of congress held at the [[time]], it was frequently seen that
washington had lost the majority in the house of representatives." the
violence of the [[language]] used against him in [[public]] was extreme, and in
a [[political]] meeting they did not scruple to compare him indirectly to
the [[treacherous]] arnold. "by the opposition," says marshall, "the friends
of the administration were declared to be an aristocratic and corrupt
faction, who, from a [[desire]] to introduce [[monarchy]], were hostile to
france and under the influence of [[britain]]; that they were a paper
nobility, whose extreme sensibility at every measure which threatened
the funds, induced a tame submission to injuries and insults, which the
interests and [[honor]] of the nation required them to resist."]

almost all the nations which have ever exercised a powerful influence
upon the destinies of the [[world]] by conceiving, following up, and
executing vast designs--from the romans to the english--have been
governed by aristocratic [[institutions]]. nor will this be a [[subject]] of
wonder when we recollect that nothing in the [[world]] has so absolute a
fixity of [[purpose]] as an [[aristocracy]]. the mass of the [[people]] may be led
astray by ignorance or passion; the [[mind]] of a [[king]] may be biased, and
his perseverance in his designs may be shaken--besides which a [[king]] is
not immortal--but an aristocratic [[body]] is too numerous to be [[led]] astray
by the blandishments of intrigue, and yet not numerous enough to yield
readily to the intoxicating influence of unreflecting passion: it has
the energy of a firm and enlightened [[individual]], added to the power
which it derives from perpetuity.




chapter xiv: advantages american [[society]] derive from democracy--part i

what the real advantages are which american [[society]] derives from the
government of the democracy

before i enter upon the [[subject]] of the [[present]] [[chapter]] i am induced
to remind the reader of what i have more than once adverted to in the
course of this [[book]]. the [[political]] [[institutions]] of the [[united]] states
appear to me to be one of the forms of [[government]] which a [[democracy]] may
adopt; but i do not regard the american [[constitution]] as the [[best]], or as
the only one, which a democratic [[people]] may establish. in showing the
advantages which the americans derive from the [[government]] of [[democracy]],
i am therefore very far from meaning, or from believing, that similar
advantages can only be obtained from the same laws [[law]].

general tendency of the laws [[law]] under the [[rule]] of the american [[democracy]],
and habits of those who apply them

defects of a democratic [[government]] easy to be discovered--its advantages
only to be discerned by long observation--democracy in [[america]] often
inexpert, but the general tendency of the laws [[law]] advantageous--in the
american [[democracy]] [[public]] officers have no permanent interests distinct
from those of the majority--result of this [[state]] of things.

the defects and the weaknesses of a democratic [[government]] may very
readily be discovered; they are demonstrated by the most flagrant
instances, whilst its beneficial influence is less perceptibly
exercised. a [[single]] glance suffices to detect its [[evil]] consequences, but
its [[good]] qualities can only be discerned by long observation. the laws
of the american [[democracy]] are frequently defective or incomplete; they
sometimes attack vested rights [[right]], or give a sanction to others which are
dangerous to the [[community]]; but even if they were [[good]], the frequent
changes which they undergo would be an [[evil]]. how comes it, then, that
the american republics [[republic]] [[prosper]] and maintain their position?

in the consideration of laws [[law]] a distinction must be carefully observed
between the end at which they aim and the means by which they are
directed to that end, between their absolute and their relative
excellence. if it be the intention of the legislator to favor the
interests of the minority at the expense of the majority, and if the
measures he takes are so combined as to accomplish the object he has in
view with the least possible expense of [[time]] and exertion, the [[law]] may
be well drawn up, although its [[purpose]] be [[bad]]; and the more efficacious
it is, the greater is the mischief which it causes.

democratic laws [[law]] generally tend to promote the welfare of the greatest
possible number; for they emanate from the majority of the [[citizens]], who
are [[subject]] to error, but who cannot have an interest opposed to their
own advantage. the laws [[law]] of an [[aristocracy]] tend, on the contrary, to
concentrate [[wealth]] and [[power]] in the hands of the minority, because
an [[aristocracy]], by its very [[nature]], constitutes a minority. it may
therefore be asserted, as a general proposition, that the [[purpose]] of
a [[democracy]] in the conduct of its legislation is useful to a greater
number of [[citizens]] than that of an [[aristocracy]]. this is, however, the
sum total of its advantages.

aristocracies are infinitely more expert in the [[science]] of legislation
than democracies [[democracy]] ever can be. they are possessed of a self-control which
protects them from the errors of temporary excitement, and they form
lasting designs which they mature with the assistance of favorable
opportunities. aristocratic [[government]] proceeds with the dexterity of
art; it understands how to make the collective [[force]] of all its laws
converge at the same [[time]] to a given point. such is not the case with
democracies, whose laws [[law]] are almost always ineffective or inopportune.
the means of [[democracy]] are therefore more imperfect than those of
aristocracy, and the measures which it unwittingly adopts are frequently
opposed to its own cause; but the object it has in view is more useful.

let us now imagine a [[community]] so organized by [[nature]], or by its
constitution, that it can support the transitory action of [[bad]] laws [[law]],
and that it can await, without destruction, the general tendency of
the legislation: we shall then be able to conceive that a democratic
government, notwithstanding its defects, will be most fitted to conduce
to the [[prosperity]] of this [[community]]. this is precisely what has occurred
in the [[united]] states; and i repeat, what i have before remarked, that
the [[great]] advantage of the americans consists in their being able to
commit faults [[fault]] which they may afterward repair.

an analogous observation may be made respecting [[public]] officers. it
is easy to perceive that the american [[democracy]] frequently errs in
the [[choice]] of the individuals [[individual]] to whom it entrusts the [[power]] of the
administration; but it is more difficult to say why the [[state]] prospers
under their [[rule]]. in the first place it is to be remarked, that if in a
democratic [[state]] the governors have less honesty and less capacity than
elsewhere, the governed, on the other hand, are more enlightened and
more attentive to their interests. as the [[people]] in democracies [[democracy]] is more
incessantly vigilant in its affairs and more [[jealous]] of its rights [[right]],
it prevents its representatives from abandoning that general line of
conduct which its own interest prescribes. in the second place, it must
be remembered that if the democratic magistrate is more apt to misuse
his [[power]], he possesses it for a shorter period of [[time]]. but there is
yet another [[reason]] which is still more general and conclusive. it is
no [[doubt]] of importance to the welfare of nations that they should be
governed by [[men]] of [[talents]] and [[virtue]]; but it is perhaps still more
important that the interests of those [[men]] should not differ from the
interests of the [[community]] at large; for, if such were the case, virtues
of a high order might become useless, and [[talents]] might be turned to
a [[bad]] account. i say that it is important that the interests of the
persons in [[authority]] should not conflict with or oppose the interests of
the [[community]] at large; but i do not insist upon their having the same
interests as the whole [[population]], because i am not aware that such a
state of things ever existed in any [[country]].

no [[political]] form has hitherto been discovered which is equally
favorable to the [[prosperity]] and the [[development]] of all the classes into
which [[society]] is divided. these classes continue to form, as it were,
a [[certain]] number of distinct nations in the same nation; and experience
has shown that it is no less dangerous to place the [[fate]] of these
classes exclusively in the hands of any one of them than it is to make
one [[people]] the arbiter of the [[destiny]] of another. when the [[rich]] alone
govern, the interest of the [[poor]] is always endangered; and when the poor
make the laws [[law]], that of the [[rich]] incurs very serious risks. the advantage
of [[democracy]] does not consist, therefore, as has sometimes been
asserted, in favoring the [[prosperity]] of all, but simply in contributing
to the well-being of the [[greatest]] possible number.

the [[men]] who are entrusted with the direction of [[public]] affairs in the
united states are frequently inferior, both in point of capacity and of
morality, to those whom aristocratic [[institutions]] would raise to
power. but their interest is identified and confounded with that of the
majority of their fellow-citizens. they may frequently be faithless and
frequently mistaken, but they will never systematically adopt a line of
conduct opposed to the will of the majority; and it is impossible that
they should give a dangerous or an exclusive tendency to the [[government]].

the mal-administration of a democratic magistrate is a mere isolated
fact, which only occurs during the short period for which he is elected.
corruption and incapacity do not act as [[common]] interests, which may
connect [[men]] permanently with one another. a [[corrupt]] or an incapable
magistrate will not concert his measures with another magistrate, simply
because that [[individual]] is as [[corrupt]] and as incapable as himself; and
these two [[men]] will never unite their endeavors to promote the corruption
and inaptitude of their remote [[posterity]]. the [[ambition]] and the
manoeuvres of the one will serve, on the contrary, to unmask the other.
the vices [[vice]] of a magistrate, in democratic states, are usually peculiar to
his own [[person]].

but under aristocratic governments [[government]] [[public]] [[men]] are swayed by the interest
of their order, which, if it is sometimes confounded with the interests
of the majority, is very frequently distinct from them. this interest is
the [[common]] and lasting bond which unites them together; it induces them
to coalesce, and to combine their efforts in order to attain an end
which does not always ensure the [[greatest]] [[happiness]] of the greatest
number; and it serves not only to connect the persons [[person]] in [[authority]],
but to unite them to a considerable portion of the [[community]], since
a numerous [[body]] of [[citizens]] belongs to the [[aristocracy]], without being
invested with official functions. the aristocratic magistrate is
therefore constantly supported by a portion of the [[community]], as well as
by the [[government]] of which he is a member.

the [[common]] [[purpose]] which connects the interest of the magistrates in
aristocracies with that of a portion of their contemporaries identifies
it with that of future generations [[generation]]; their influence belongs to the
future as much as to the [[present]]. the aristocratic magistrate is urged
at the same [[time]] toward the same point by the [[passions]] of the [[community]],
by his own, and i may almost add by those of his [[posterity]]. is it, then,
wonderful that he does not resist such repeated impulses? and indeed
aristocracies are often carried away by the spirit of their order
without being corrupted by it; and they unconsciously [[fashion]] [[society]] to
their own ends, and prepare it for their own descendants.

the english [[aristocracy]] is perhaps the most liberal which ever existed,
and no [[body]] of [[men]] has ever, uninterruptedly, furnished so many
honorable and enlightened individuals [[individual]] to the [[government]] of a [[country]]. it
cannot, however, escape observation that in the legislation of england
the [[good]] of the [[poor]] has been sacrificed to the advantage of the
rich, and the rights [[right]] of the majority to the privileges [[privilege]] of the few. the
consequence is, that [[england]], at the [[present]] day, combines the extremes
of [[fortune]] in the bosom of her [[society]], and her perils and calamities
are almost [[equal]] to her [[power]] and her renown. *a

[footnote a: [the legislation of [[england]] for the forty years is
certainly not fairly open to this criticism, which was written before
the reform bill of 1832, and accordingly [[great]] [[britain]] has thus far
escaped and surmounted the perils and calamities to which she seemed to
be exposed.]]

in the [[united]] states, where the [[public]] officers have no interests to
promote connected with their caste, the general and constant influence
of the [[government]] is beneficial, although the individuals [[individual]] who conduct it
are frequently unskilful and sometimes contemptible. there is indeed a
secret tendency in democratic [[institutions]] to render the exertions
of the [[citizens]] subservient to the [[prosperity]] of the [[community]],
notwithstanding their private vices [[vice]] and mistakes; whilst in aristocratic
institutions there is a secret propensity which, notwithstanding the
talents and the virtues [[virtue]] of those who conduct the [[government]], leads them
to contribute to the evils [[evil]] which [[oppress]] their fellow-creatures. in
aristocratic governments [[government]] [[public]] [[men]] may frequently do injuries which
they do not intend, and in democratic states they [[produce]] advantages
which they never [[thought]] of.

public spirit in the [[united]] states

patriotism of instinct--patriotism of reflection--their different
characteristics--nations ought to strive to acquire the second when the
first has disappeared--efforts of the americans to it--interest of the
individual intimately connected with that of the [[country]].

there is one sort of patriotic attachment which principally arises from
that instinctive, disinterested, and undefinable feeling which connects
the affections of [[man]] with his birthplace. this [[natural]] fondness is
united to a taste for ancient customs, and to a reverence for ancestral
traditions of the [[past]]; those who cherish it [[love]] their [[country]] as they
love the mansions of their fathers [[father]]. they enjoy the tranquillity which
it affords them; they cling to the peaceful habits which they have
contracted within its bosom; they are attached to the reminiscences
which it awakens, and they are even pleased by the [[state]] of obedience
in which they are placed. this [[patriotism]] is sometimes stimulated
by [[religious]] enthusiasm, and then it is capable of making the most
prodigious efforts. it is in itself a [[kind]] of [[religion]]; it does not
reason, but it acts from the impulse of [[faith]] and of sentiment. by
some nations the monarch has been regarded as a personification of the
country; and the fervor of [[patriotism]] being converted into the fervor of
loyalty, they took a sympathetic [[pride]] in his conquests, and gloried in
his [[power]]. at one [[time]], under the ancient [[monarchy]], the french [[felt]] a
sort of satisfaction in the sense of their dependence upon the arbitrary
pleasure of their [[king]], and they were wont to say with [[pride]], "we are
the subjects [[subject]] of the most powerful [[king]] in the [[world]]."

but, like all instinctive [[passions]], this [[kind]] of [[patriotism]] is more apt
to prompt transient exertion than to supply the motives of continuous
endeavor. it may save the [[state]] in critical circumstances, but it will
not unfrequently allow the nation to decline in the midst of [[peace]].
whilst the manners of a [[people]] are simple and its [[faith]] unshaken, whilst
society is steadily based upon traditional [[institutions]] whose legitimacy
has never been contested, this instinctive [[patriotism]] is wont to endure.

but there is another [[species]] of attachment to a [[country]] which is more
rational than the one we have been describing. it is perhaps less
generous and less ardent, but it is more fruitful and more lasting; it
is coeval with the spread of [[knowledge]], it is nurtured by the laws [[law]], it
grows by the exercise of civil rights [[right]], and, in the end, it is confounded
with the personal interest of the citizen. a [[man]] comprehends the
influence which the [[prosperity]] of his [[country]] has upon his own welfare;
he is aware that the laws [[law]] authorize him to contribute his assistance
to that [[prosperity]], and he labors to promote it as a portion of his
interest in the first place, and as a portion of his [[right]] in the
second.

but epochs sometimes occur, in the course of the existence of a nation,
at which the ancient customs of a [[people]] are changed, [[public]] morality
destroyed, [[religious]] [[belief]] disturbed, and the spell of tradition
broken, whilst the diffusion of [[knowledge]] is yet imperfect, and the
civil rights [[right]] of the [[community]] are ill secured, or confined within very
narrow limits. the [[country]] then assumes a dim and dubious shape in the
eyes of the [[citizens]]; they no longer behold it in the soil which they
inhabit, for that soil is to them a dull inanimate clod; nor in the
usages of their forefathers, which they have been taught to look upon
as a debasing yoke; nor in [[religion]], for of that they [[doubt]]; nor in
the laws [[law]], which do not originate in their own [[authority]]; nor in the
legislator, whom they [[fear]] and despise. the [[country]] is lost to their
senses, they can neither discover it under its own nor under borrowed
features, and they entrench themselves within the dull precincts of
a narrow egotism. they are emancipated from prejudice without having
acknowledged the [[empire]] of [[reason]]; they are neither animated by the
instinctive [[patriotism]] of monarchical subjects [[subject]] nor by the thinking
patriotism of republican [[citizens]]; but they have stopped halfway between
the two, in the midst of confusion and of distress.

in this predicament, to retreat is impossible; for a [[people]] cannot
restore the vivacity of its earlier times [[time]], any more than a [[man]] can
return to the innocence and the bloom of [[childhood]]; such things may
be regretted, but they cannot be renewed. the only thing, then, which
remains to be done is to proceed, and to accelerate the union of private
with [[public]] interests, since the period of disinterested [[patriotism]] is
gone by forever.

i am certainly very far from averring that, in order to obtain this
result, the exercise of [[political]] rights [[right]] should be immediately granted
to all the members of the [[community]]. but i maintain that the most
powerful, and perhaps the only, means of interesting [[men]] in the welfare
of their [[country]] which we still possess is to make them partakers in the
government. at the [[present]] [[time]] civic zeal seems to me to be inseparable
from the exercise of [[political]] rights [[right]]; and i hold that the number of
citizens will be found to augment or to decrease in [[europe]] in proportion
as those rights [[right]] are extended.

in the [[united]] states the inhabitants were thrown but as yesterday upon
the soil which they now occupy, and they brought neither customs nor
traditions with them there; they meet each other for the first time
with no previous acquaintance; in short, the instinctive [[love]] of their
country can scarcely [[exist]] in their minds [[mind]]; but everyone takes as zealous
an interest in the affairs of his township, his county, and of the whole
state, as if they were his own, because everyone, in his sphere, takes
an active part in the [[government]] of [[society]].

the lower orders in the [[united]] states are alive to the perception of the
influence exercised by the general [[prosperity]] upon their own welfare;
and simple as this observation is, it is one which is but too rarely
made by the [[people]]. but in [[america]] the [[people]] regards this [[prosperity]] as
the result of its own exertions; the citizen looks upon the [[fortune]] of
the [[public]] as his private interest, and he co-operates in its [[success]],
not so much from a sense of [[pride]] or of [[duty]], as from what i shall
venture to term cupidity.

it is unnecessary to study the [[institutions]] and the [[history]] of the
americans in order to discover the [[truth]] of this remark, for their
manners render it sufficiently evident. as the american participates
in all that is done in his [[country]], he thinks [[think]] himself obliged to defend
whatever may be censured; for it is not only his [[country]] which is
attacked upon these occasions [[occasion]], but it is himself. the consequence is,
that his national [[pride]] resorts to a thousand artifices, and to all the
petty tricks of [[individual]] vanity.

nothing is more embarrassing in the ordinary intercourse of [[life]] than
this irritable [[patriotism]] of the americans. a stranger may be very well
inclined to [[praise]] many of the [[institutions]] of their [[country]], but he
begs permission to blame some of the peculiarities which he observes--a
permission which is, however, inexorably refused. [[america]] is therefore a
free [[country]], in which, lest anybody should be hurt by your remarks, you
are not allowed to speak freely of private individuals [[individual]], or of the
state, of the [[citizens]] or of the authorities [[authority]], of [[public]] or of private
undertakings, or, in short, of anything at all, except it be of the
climate and the soil; and even then americans will be found ready to
defend either the one or the other, as if they had been contrived by the
inhabitants of the [[country]].

in our times [[time]] option must be made between the [[patriotism]] of all and the
government of a few; for the [[force]] and activity which the first confers
are irreconcilable with the guarantees of tranquillity which the second
furnishes.

notion of rights [[right]] in the [[united]] states

no [[great]] [[people]] without a notion of rights--how the notion of rights [[right]] can
be given to people--respect of rights [[right]] in the [[united]] states--whence it
arises.

after the [[idea]] of [[virtue]], i [[know]] no higher [[principle]] than that of [[right]];
or, to speak more accurately, these two ideas [[idea]] are commingled in one.
the [[idea]] of [[right]] is simply that of [[virtue]] introduced into the political
world. it is the [[idea]] of [[right]] which enabled [[men]] to define [[anarchy]] and
tyranny; and which taught them to remain independent without arrogance,
as well as to obey without servility. the [[man]] who submits to violence
is debased by his compliance; but when he obeys the mandate of one
who possesses that [[right]] of [[authority]] which he acknowledges in a
fellow-creature, he rises in some measure above the [[person]] who delivers
the command. there are no [[great]] [[men]] without [[virtue]], and there are
no [[great]] nations--it may almost be added that there would be no
society--without the notion of rights [[right]]; for what is the condition of a
mass of [[rational]] and [[intelligent]] beings who are only [[united]] together by
the bond of [[force]]?

i am persuaded that the only means which we possess at the [[present]] time
of inculcating the notion of rights [[right]], and of rendering it, as it were,
palpable to the senses, is to invest all the members of the community
with the peaceful exercise of [[certain]] rights [[right]]: this is very clearly seen
in [[children]], who are [[men]] without the [[strength]] and the [[experience]] of
manhood. when a child begins to move in the midst of the objects which
surround him, he is instinctively [[led]] to turn everything which he can
lay his hands upon to his own purposes [[purpose]]; he has no notion of the property
of others; but as he gradually learns the value of things, and begins
to perceive that he may in his turn be deprived of his possessions, he
becomes more circumspect, and he observes those rights [[right]] in others which
he wishes [[wish]] to have respected in himself. the [[principle]] which the child
derives from the possession of his toys is taught to the [[man]] by the
objects which he may call his own. in [[america]] those complaints against
property in general which are so frequent in [[europe]] are never heard,
because in [[america]] there are no paupers; and as everyone has [[property]] of
his own to defend, everyone recognizes the [[principle]] upon which he holds
it.

the same thing occurs in the [[political]] [[world]]. in [[america]] the lowest
classes have conceived a very high notion of [[political]] rights [[right]], because
they exercise those rights [[right]]; and they refrain from attacking those of
other [[people]], in order to ensure their own from attack. whilst in europe
the same classes sometimes recalcitrate even against the supreme [[power]],
the american submits without a murmur to the [[authority]] of the pettiest
magistrate.

this [[truth]] is exemplified by the most trivial details of national
peculiarities. in [[france]] very few pleasures [[pleasure]] are exclusively reserved
for the higher classes; the [[poor]] are admitted wherever the [[rich]] are
received, and they consequently behave with propriety, and respect
whatever contributes to the enjoyments in which they themselves
participate. in [[england]], where [[wealth]] has a [[monopoly]] of amusement as
well as of [[power]], complaints are made that whenever the [[poor]] happen to
steal into the enclosures which are reserved for the pleasures [[pleasure]] of the
rich, they commit acts of wanton mischief: can this be wondered at,
since [[care]] has been taken that they should have nothing to lose? *b

[footnote b: [this, too, has been amended by much larger provisions for
the amusements of the [[people]] in [[public]] parks, gardens, museums, etc.;
and the conduct of the [[people]] in these places of amusement has improved
in the same proportion.]]

the [[government]] of [[democracy]] brings the notion of [[political]] rights [[right]] to
the level of the humblest [[citizens]], just as the dissemination of wealth
brings the notion of [[property]] within the reach of all the members of the
community; and i confess that, to my [[mind]], this is one of its greatest
advantages. i do not assert that it is easy to [[teach]] [[men]] to exercise
political rights [[right]]; but i maintain that, when it is possible, the effects
which result from it are highly important; and i add that, if there ever
was a [[time]] at which such an attempt ought to be made, that [[time]] is our
own. it is clear that the influence of [[religious]] [[belief]] is shaken, and
that the notion of [[divine]] rights [[right]] is declining; it is evident that
public morality is vitiated, and the notion of [[moral]] rights [[right]] is also
disappearing: these are general symptoms of the substitution of argument
for [[faith]], and of calculation for the impulses of sentiment. if, in the
midst of this general disruption, you do not succeed in connecting
the notion of rights [[right]] with that of personal interest, which is the
only immutable point in the [[human]] [[heart]], what means will you have of
governing the [[world]] except by [[fear]]? when i am told that, since the laws
are [[weak]] and the populace is wild, since [[passions]] are excited and the
authority of [[virtue]] is paralyzed, no measures must be taken to increase
the rights [[right]] of the [[democracy]], i reply, that it is for these very reasons
that some measures of the [[kind]] must be taken; and i am persuaded that
governments are still more interested in taking them than [[society]] at
large, because governments [[government]] are liable to be destroyed and [[society]] cannot
perish.

i am not, however, inclined to exaggerate the [[example]] which america
furnishes. in those states the [[people]] are invested with [[political]] rights
at a [[time]] when they could scarcely be abused, for the [[citizens]] were
few in number and simple in their manners. as they have increased, the
americans have not augmented the [[power]] of the [[democracy]], but they
have, if i may use the expression, extended its dominions. it cannot
be doubted that the moment at which [[political]] rights [[right]] are granted to a
people that had before been without them is a very critical, though it
be a necessary one. a child may kill before he is aware of the value
of [[life]]; and he may deprive another [[person]] of his [[property]] before he is
aware that his own may be taken away from him. the lower orders, when
first they are invested with [[political]] rights [[right]], stand, in relation to
those rights [[right]], in the same position as the child does to the whole of
nature, and the celebrated adage may then be applied to them, homo puer
robustus. this [[truth]] may even be perceived in [[america]]. the states in
which the [[citizens]] have enjoyed their rights [[right]] longest are those in which
they make the [[best]] use of them.

it cannot be repeated too often that nothing is more fertile in
prodigies than the art [[arts]] of being [[free]]; but there is nothing more arduous
than the apprenticeship of [[liberty]]. such is not the case with despotic
institutions: despotism often promises to make amends for a thousand
previous ills; it supports the [[right]], it protects the [[oppressed]], and it
maintains [[public]] order. the nation is lulled by the temporary prosperity
which accrues to it, until it is roused to a sense of its own misery.
liberty, on the contrary, is generally established in the midst of
agitation, it is perfected by civil discord, and its benefits cannot be
appreciated until it is already old.




chapter xiv: advantages american [[society]] derive from democracy--part ii

respect for the [[law]] in the [[united]] states

respect of the americans for the law--parental affection which they
entertain for it--personal interest of everyone to increase the
authority of the [[law]].

it is not always feasible to consult the whole [[people]], either directly
or indirectly, in the formation of the [[law]]; but it cannot be denied
that, when such a measure is possible the [[authority]] of the [[law]] is very
much augmented. this popular origin, which impairs the excellence and
the [[wisdom]] of legislation, contributes prodigiously to increase
its [[power]]. there is an amazing [[strength]] in the expression of the
determination of a whole [[people]], and when it declares itself the
imagination of those who are most inclined to contest it is overawed by
its [[authority]]. the [[truth]] of this [[fact]] is very well known by parties, and
they consequently strive to make out a majority whenever they can. if
they have not the greater number of voters on their side, they assert
that the true majority abstained from voting; and if they are foiled
even there, they have recourse to the [[body]] of those persons [[person]] who had no
votes to give.

in the [[united]] states, except slaves [[slave]], servants, and paupers in the
receipt of relief from the townships, there is no class of persons
who do not exercise the elective franchise, and who do not indirectly
contribute to make the laws [[law]]. those who design to attack the laws [[law]] must
consequently either modify the [[opinion]] of the nation or trample upon its
decision.

a second [[reason]], which is still more weighty, may be further adduced;
in the [[united]] states everyone is personally interested in enforcing the
obedience of the whole [[community]] to the [[law]]; for as the minority may
shortly rally the majority to its principles [[principle]], it is interested in
professing that [[respect]] for the decrees of the legislator which it may
soon have [[occasion]] to claim for its own. however irksome an enactment
may be, the citizen of the [[united]] states complies with it, not only
because it is the [[work]] of the majority, but because it originates in his
own [[authority]], and he regards it as a contract to which he is himself a
party.

in the [[united]] states, then, that numerous and turbulent multitude does
not [[exist]] which always looks upon the [[law]] as its [[natural]] [[enemy]], and
accordingly surveys it with [[fear]] and with [[fear]] and with distrust. it is
impossible, on the other hand, not to perceive that all classes display
the utmost reliance upon the legislation of their [[country]], and that they
are attached to it by a [[kind]] of parental affection.

i am [[wrong]], however, in saying all classes; for as in [[america]] the
european scale of [[authority]] is inverted, the wealthy are there placed in
a position analogous to that of the [[poor]] in the old [[world]], and it is
the opulent classes which frequently look upon the [[law]] with suspicion.
i have already observed that the advantage of [[democracy]] is not, as has
been sometimes asserted, that it protects the interests of the whole
community, but simply that it protects those of the majority. in the
united states, where the [[poor]] [[rule]], the [[rich]] have always some [[reason]] to
dread the abuses [[abuse]] of their [[power]]. this [[natural]] [[anxiety]] of the [[rich]] may
produce a sullen dissatisfaction, but [[society]] is not disturbed by it;
for the same [[reason]] which induces the [[rich]] to withhold their confidence
in the legislative [[authority]] makes them obey its mandates; their [[wealth]],
which prevents them from making the [[law]], prevents them from withstanding
it. amongst civilized nations revolts are rarely excited, except by such
persons as have nothing to lose by them; and if the laws [[law]] of a democracy
are not always worthy of [[respect]], at least they always obtain it; for
those who usually infringe the laws [[law]] have no excuse for not complying
with the enactments they have themselves made, and by which they are
themselves benefited, whilst the [[citizens]] whose interests might be
promoted by the infraction of them are induced, by their [[character]] and
their stations, to submit to the decisions of the legislature, whatever
they may be. besides which, the [[people]] in [[america]] obeys the [[law]] not
only because it emanates from the popular [[authority]], but because that
authority may modify it in any points which may prove vexatory; a law
is observed because it is a self-imposed [[evil]] in the first place, and an
evil of transient duration in the second.

activity which pervades all the branches of the [[body]] [[politic]] in the
united states; influence which it exercises upon society

more difficult to conceive the [[political]] activity which pervades the
united states than the [[freedom]] and equality which reign there--the great
activity which perpetually agitates the legislative bodies [[body]] is only an
episode to the general activity--difficult for an american to confine
himself to his own business--political agitation extends to all social
intercourse--commercial activity of the americans partly attributable to
this cause--indirect advantages which [[society]] derives from a democratic
government.

on passing from a [[country]] in which [[free]] [[institutions]] are established to
one where they do not [[exist]], the traveller is struck by the [[change]]; in
the former all is bustle and activity, in the latter everything is calm
and motionless. in the one, amelioration and [[progress]] are the general
topics of inquiry; in the other, it seems as if the [[community]] only
aspired to repose in the enjoyment of the advantages which it has
acquired. nevertheless, the [[country]] which exerts itself so strenuously
to promote its welfare is generally more wealthy and more prosperous
than that which appears to be so contented with its lot; and when we
compare them together, we can scarcely conceive how so many new wants
are daily [[felt]] in the former, whilst so few seem to occur in the latter.

if this remark is applicable to those [[free]] countries [[country]] in which
monarchical and aristocratic [[institutions]] subsist, it is still more
striking with regard to democratic republics [[republic]]. in these states it is not
only a portion of the [[people]] which is busied with the amelioration of
its social condition, but the whole [[community]] is engaged in the task;
and it is not the exigencies and the convenience of a [[single]] class for
which a provision is to be made, but the exigencies and the convenience
of all ranks of [[life]].

it is not impossible to conceive the surpassing [[liberty]] which the
americans enjoy; some [[idea]] may likewise be formed of the extreme
equality which subsists amongst them, but the [[political]] activity which
pervades the [[united]] states must be seen in order to be understood. no
sooner do you set foot upon the american soil than you are stunned by a
kind of tumult; a confused clamor is heard on every side; and a thousand
simultaneous voices demand the immediate satisfaction of their social
wants. everything is in motion around you; here, the [[people]] of one
quarter of a town are met to decide upon the building of a [[church]];
there, the election of a representative is going on; a little further
the delegates of a district are posting to the town in order to consult
upon some local improvements; or in another place the laborers of a
village quit their ploughs to deliberate upon the project of a road or
a [[public]] school. meetings are called for the sole [[purpose]] of declaring
their disapprobation of the line of conduct pursued by the [[government]];
whilst in other assemblies the [[citizens]] salute the authorities [[authority]] of the
day as the fathers [[father]] of their [[country]]. societies [[society]] are formed which regard
drunkenness as the principal cause of the evils [[evil]] under which the state
labors, and which solemnly bind themselves to give a constant [[example]] of
temperance. *c

[footnote c: at the [[time]] of my stay in the [[united]] states the temperance
societies already consisted of more than 270,000 members, and their
effect had been to diminish the consumption of fermented liquors by
500,000 gallons per annum in the [[state]] of pennsylvania alone.]

the [[great]] [[political]] agitation of the american legislative bodies [[body]], which
is the only [[kind]] of excitement that attracts the attention of foreign
countries, is a mere episode or a sort of continuation of that universal
movement which originates in the lowest classes of the [[people]] and
extends successively to all the ranks of [[society]]. it is impossible to
spend more efforts in the pursuit of enjoyment.

the cares [[care]] of [[political]] [[life]] engross a most prominent place in the
occupation of a citizen in the [[united]] states, and almost the only
pleasure of which an american has any [[idea]] is to take a part in the
government, and to discuss the part he has taken. this feeling pervades
the most trifling habits of [[life]]; even the [[women]] frequently attend
public meetings and listen to [[political]] harangues as a recreation
after their household labors. debating clubs are to a [[certain]] extent a
substitute for theatrical entertainments: an american cannot converse,
but he can discuss; and when he attempts to talk he falls into a
dissertation. he speaks to you as if he was addressing a meeting; and
if he should [[chance]] to warm in the course of the discussion, he will
infallibly say, "gentlemen," to the [[person]] with whom he is conversing.

in some countries [[country]] the inhabitants display a [[certain]] repugnance to avail
themselves of the [[political]] privileges [[privilege]] with which the [[law]] invests them;
it would seem that they set too high a value upon their [[time]] to spend
it on the interests of the [[community]]; and they prefer to withdraw within
the exact limits of a wholesome egotism, marked out by four sunk fences
and a quickset hedge. but if an american were condemned to confine
his activity to his own affairs, he would be robbed of one half of
his existence; he would [[feel]] an immense void in the [[life]] which he is
accustomed to lead, and his wretchedness would be unbearable. *d i am
persuaded that, if ever a despotic [[government]] is established in [[america]],
it will find it more difficult to surmount the habits which free
institutions have engendered than to conquer the attachment of the
citizens to [[freedom]].

[footnote d: the same remark was made at [[rome]] under the first caesars.
montesquieu somewhere alludes to the excessive despondency of certain
roman [[citizens]] who, after the excitement of [[political]] [[life]], were all at
once flung back into the stagnation of private [[life]].]

this ceaseless agitation which democratic [[government]] has introduced into
the [[political]] [[world]] influences all social intercourse. i am not sure
that upon the whole this is not the [[greatest]] advantage of [[democracy]]. and
i am much less inclined to applaud it for what it does than for what
it causes to be done. it is incontestable that the [[people]] frequently
conducts [[public]] [[business]] very ill; but it is impossible that the lower
orders should take a part in [[public]] [[business]] without extending the
circle of their ideas [[idea]], and without quitting the ordinary routine of
their mental acquirements. the humblest [[individual]] who is called upon
to co-operate in the [[government]] of [[society]] acquires a [[certain]] [[degree]] of
self-respect; and as he possesses [[authority]], he can command the services
of minds [[mind]] much more enlightened than his own. he is canvassed by a
multitude of applicants, who seek to [[deceive]] him in a thousand different
ways, but who instruct him by their deceit. he takes a part in political
undertakings which did not originate in his own conception, but which
give him a taste for undertakings of the [[kind]]. new ameliorations are
daily pointed out in the [[property]] which he holds in [[common]] with others,
and this gives him the [[desire]] of improving that [[property]] which is more
peculiarly his own. he is perhaps neither happier nor [[better]] than those
who came before him, but he is [[better]] informed and more active. i have
no [[doubt]] that the democratic [[institutions]] of the [[united]] states, joined
to the physical [[constitution]] of the [[country]], are the cause (not
the direct, as is so often asserted, but the indirect cause) of the
prodigious commercial activity of the inhabitants. it is not engendered
by the laws [[law]], but the [[people]] learns how to promote it by the experience
derived from legislation.

when the opponents of [[democracy]] assert that a [[single]] [[individual]] performs
the duties [[duty]] which he undertakes much [[better]] than the [[government]] of
the [[community]], it appears to me that they are perfectly [[right]]. the
government of an [[individual]], supposing an equality of instruction on
either side, is more consistent, more persevering, and more accurate
than that of a multitude, and it is much [[better]] qualified judiciously
to discriminate the characters [[character]] of the [[men]] it employs. if any deny what i
advance, they have certainly never seen a democratic [[government]], or have
formed their [[opinion]] upon very partial evidence. it is true that
even when local circumstances and the disposition of the [[people]] allow
democratic [[institutions]] to subsist, they never display a regular
and methodical [[system]] of [[government]]. democratic [[liberty]] is far from
accomplishing all the projects it undertakes, with the [[skill]] of an
adroit despotism. it frequently abandons them before they have borne
their fruits, or risks them when the consequences may prove dangerous;
but in the end it produces [[produce]] more than any absolute [[government]], and if it
do fewer things well, it does a greater number of things. under its
sway the transactions of the [[public]] administration are not nearly so
important as what is done by private exertion. [[democracy]] does not confer
the most skilful [[kind]] of [[government]] upon the [[people]], but it produces
that which the most skilful governments [[government]] are frequently unable to awaken,
namely, an all-pervading and restless activity, a superabundant [[force]],
and an energy which is inseparable from it, and which may, under
favorable circumstances, beget the most amazing benefits. these are the
true advantages of [[democracy]].

in the [[present]] [[age]], when the destinies of christendom seem to be in
suspense, some hasten to assail [[democracy]] as its foe whilst it is yet in
its early [[growth]]; and others are ready with their vows of adoration for
this new deity which is springing forth from [[chaos]]: but both parties are
very imperfectly acquainted with the object of their [[hatred]] or of their
desires; they strike in the dark, and distribute their blows by mere
chance.

we must first [[understand]] what the purport of [[society]] and the aim of
government is held to be. if it be your intention to confer a certain
elevation upon the [[human]] [[mind]], and to [[teach]] it to regard the things of
this [[world]] with generous feelings, to inspire [[men]] with a scorn of mere
temporal advantage, to give birth to living convictions, and to keep
alive the spirit of honorable devotedness; if you hold it to be a good
thing to refine the habits, to embellish the manners, to cultivate the
arts of a nation, and to promote the [[love]] of poetry, of [[beauty]], and of
renown; if you would constitute a [[people]] not unfitted to act with power
upon all other nations, nor unprepared for those high enterprises which,
whatever be the result of its efforts, will leave a name forever famous
in time--if you [[believe]] such to be the principal object of [[society]], you
must avoid the [[government]] of [[democracy]], which would be a very uncertain
guide to the end you have in view.

but if you hold it to be expedient to divert the [[moral]] and intellectual
activity of [[man]] to the production of comfort, and to the acquirement of
the necessaries of [[life]]; if a clear understanding be more profitable
to [[man]] than genius; if your object be not to stimulate the virtues [[virtue]] of
heroism, but to create habits of [[peace]]; if you had rather witness vices
than crimes and are content to meet with fewer [[noble]] deeds, provided
offences be diminished in the same proportion; if, instead of living
in the midst of a brilliant [[state]] of [[society]], you are contented to
have [[prosperity]] around you; if, in short, you are of [[opinion]] that the
principal object of a [[government]] is not to confer the [[greatest]] possible
share of [[power]] and of [[glory]] upon the [[body]] of the nation, but to ensure
the [[greatest]] [[degree]] of enjoyment and the least [[degree]] of misery to each
of the individuals [[individual]] who compose it--if such be your desires [[desire]], you can have
no surer means of satisfying them than by equalizing the conditions of
men, and establishing democratic [[institutions]].

but if the [[time]] be passed at which such a [[choice]] was possible, and if
some superhuman [[power]] impel us towards one or the other of these two
governments without consulting our wishes [[wish]], let us at least endeavor to
make the [[best]] of that which is allotted to us; and let us so inquire
into its [[good]] and its [[evil]] propensities as to be able to foster the
former and repress the latter to the utmost.




chapter xv: unlimited [[power]] of majority, and its consequences--part i

chapter summary

natural [[strength]] of the majority in democracies--most of the american
constitutions have increased this [[strength]] by artificial means--how this
has been done--pledged delegates--moral [[power]] of the majority--opinion
as to its infallibility--respect for its rights [[right]], how augmented in the
united states.

unlimited [[power]] of the majority in the [[united]] states, and its
consequences

the very essence of democratic [[government]] consists in the absolute
sovereignty of the majority; for there is nothing in democratic states
which is capable of resisting it. most of the american constitutions
have sought to increase this [[natural]] [[strength]] of the majority by
artificial means. *a

[footnote a: we observed, in examining the federal [[constitution]], that
the efforts of the legislators of the union had been diametrically
opposed to the [[present]] tendency. the consequence has been that the
federal [[government]] is more independent in its sphere than that of the
states. but the federal [[government]] scarcely ever interferes in any
but external affairs; and the governments [[government]] of the [[state]] are in the
governments of the states are in reality the authorities [[authority]] which direct
society in [[america]].]

the legislature is, of all [[political]] [[institutions]], the one which is most
easily swayed by the wishes [[wish]] of the majority. the americans determined
that the members of the legislature should be elected by the people
immediately, and for a very brief term, in order to [[subject]] them, not
only to the general convictions, but even to the daily passion, of their
constituents. the members of both houses are taken from the same
class in [[society]], and are nominated in the same manner; so that the
modifications of the legislative bodies [[body]] are almost as rapid and quite as
irresistible as those of a [[single]] assembly. it is to a legislature thus
constituted that almost all the [[authority]] of the [[government]] has been
entrusted.

but whilst the [[law]] increased the [[strength]] of those authorities [[authority]] which
of themselves were [[strong]], it enfeebled more and more those which were
naturally [[weak]]. it deprived the representatives of the executive of all
stability and independence, and by subjecting them completely to the
caprices of the legislature, it robbed them of the slender influence
which the [[nature]] of a democratic [[government]] might have allowed them to
retain. in several states the judicial [[power]] was also submitted to the
elective discretion of the majority, and in all of them its existence
was made to depend on the [[pleasure]] of the legislative [[authority]], since
the representatives were empowered annually to regulate the stipend of
the judges [[judge]].

custom, however, has done even more than [[law]]. a proceeding which will in
the end set all the guarantees of representative [[government]] at naught
is becoming more and more general in the [[united]] states; it frequently
happens that the electors, who choose a delegate, point out a certain
line of conduct to him, and impose upon him a [[certain]] number of positive
obligations which he is pledged to fulfil. with the exception of the
tumult, this comes to the same thing as if the majority of the populace
held its deliberations in the market-place.

several other circumstances concur in rendering the [[power]] of the
majority in [[america]] not only preponderant, but irresistible. the moral
authority of the majority is partly based upon the notion that there
is more [[intelligence]] and more [[wisdom]] in a [[great]] number of [[men]] collected
together than in a [[single]] [[individual]], and that the quantity of
legislators is more important than their quality. the theory of equality
is in [[fact]] applied to the [[intellect]] of [[man]]: and [[human]] [[pride]] is thus
assailed in its [[last]] retreat by a doctrine which the minority hesitate
to admit, and in which they very slowly concur. like all other powers [[power]],
and perhaps more than all other powers [[power]], the [[authority]] of the many
requires the sanction of [[time]]; at first it enforces [[obedience]] by
constraint, but its laws [[law]] are not respected until they have long been
maintained.

the [[right]] of governing [[society]], which the majority supposes itself to
derive from its superior [[intelligence]], was introduced into the united
states by the first settlers, and this [[idea]], which would be sufficient
of itself to create a [[free]] nation, has now been amalgamated with the
manners of the [[people]] and the minor incidents of social intercourse.

the french, under the old [[monarchy]], held it for a [[maxim]] (which is still
a fundamental [[principle]] of the english constitution) that the king
could do no [[wrong]]; and if he did do [[wrong]], the blame was imputed to his
advisers. this notion was highly favorable to habits of [[obedience]], and
it enabled the [[subject]] to [[complain]] of the [[law]] without ceasing to love
and [[honor]] the lawgiver. the americans entertain the same [[opinion]] with
respect to the majority.

the [[moral]] [[power]] of the majority is founded upon yet another [[principle]],
which is, that the interests of the many are to be preferred to those
of the few. it will readily be perceived that the [[respect]] here professed
for the rights [[right]] of the majority must naturally increase or diminish
according to the [[state]] of parties. when a nation is divided into
several irreconcilable factions, the [[privilege]] of the majority is often
overlooked, because it is intolerable to comply with its demands.

if there existed in [[america]] a class of [[citizens]] whom the legislating
majority sought to deprive of exclusive privileges [[privilege]] which they had
possessed for ages [[age]], and to bring down from an elevated station to the
level of the ranks of the multitude, it is probable that the minority
would be less ready to comply with its laws [[law]]. but as the [[united]] states
were colonized by [[men]] holding [[equal]] rank amongst themselves, there is as
yet no [[natural]] or permanent source of dissension between the interests
of its different inhabitants.

there are [[certain]] communities [[community]] in which the persons [[person]] who constitute the
minority can never [[hope]] to draw over the majority to their side, because
they must then give up the very point which is at issue between them.
thus, an [[aristocracy]] can never become a majority whilst it retains its
exclusive privileges [[privilege]], and it cannot cede its privileges [[privilege]] without ceasing
to be an [[aristocracy]].

in the [[united]] states [[political]] questions [[question]] cannot be taken up in so
general and absolute a manner, and all parties are willing to recognize
the [[right]] of the majority, because they all [[hope]] to turn those rights [[right]] to
their own advantage at some future [[time]]. the majority therefore in that
country exercises a prodigious actual [[authority]], and a [[moral]] influence
which is scarcely less preponderant; no obstacles [[exist]] which can impede
or so much as retard its [[progress]], or which can induce it to heed the
complaints of those whom it crushes upon its path. this [[state]] of things
is fatal in itself and dangerous for the future.

how the unlimited [[power]] of the majority increases in [[america]] the
instability of legislation and administration inherent in democracy
the americans increase the mutability of the laws [[law]] which is inherent in
democracy by changing the legislature every year, and by investing
it with unbounded authority--the same effect is produced upon the
administration--in [[america]] social amelioration is conducted more
energetically but less perseveringly than in [[europe]].

i have already spoken of the [[natural]] defects of democratic [[institutions]],
and they all of them increase at the exact ratio of the [[power]] of the
majority. to begin with the most evident of them all; the mutability
of the laws [[law]] is an [[evil]] inherent in democratic [[government]], because it is
natural to democracies [[democracy]] to raise [[men]] to [[power]] in very rapid succession.
but this [[evil]] is more or less sensible in proportion to the authority
and the means of action which the legislature possesses.

in [[america]] the [[authority]] exercised by the legislative bodies [[body]] is supreme;
nothing prevents them from accomplishing their wishes [[wish]] with celerity, and
with irresistible [[power]], whilst they are supplied by new representatives
every year. that is to say, the circumstances which contribute most
powerfully to democratic instability, and which admit of the free
application of caprice to every object in the [[state]], are here in full
operation. in conformity with this [[principle]], [[america]] is, at the present
day, the [[country]] in the [[world]] where laws [[law]] [[last]] the shortest [[time]]. almost
all the american constitutions [[constitution]] have been amended within the course of
thirty years: there is therefore not a [[single]] american [[state]] which has
not modified the principles [[principle]] of its legislation in that lapse of [[time]].
as for the laws [[law]] themselves, a [[single]] glance upon the archives of the
different states of the union suffices to convince one that in america
the activity of the legislator never slackens. not that the american
democracy is naturally less stable than any other, but that it is
allowed to [[follow]] its capricious propensities in the formation of the
laws. *b

[footnote b: the legislative acts promulgated by the [[state]] of
massachusetts alone, from the year 1780 to the [[present]] [[time]], already
fill three stout volumes; and it must not be forgotten that the
collection to which i allude was published in 1823, when many old laws
which had fallen into disuse were omitted. the [[state]] of massachusetts,
which is not more populous than a department of [[france]], may be
considered as the most stable, the most consistent, and the most
sagacious in its undertakings of the whole union.]

the omnipotence of the majority, and the rapid as well as absolute
manner in which its decisions are executed in the [[united]] states, has not
only the effect of rendering the [[law]] unstable, but it exercises the same
influence upon the execution of the [[law]] and the conduct of the public
administration. as the majority is the only [[power]] which it is important
to court, all its projects are taken up with the [[greatest]] ardor, but no
sooner is its attention distracted than all this ardor ceases; whilst in
the [[free]] states of [[europe]] the administration is at once independent and
secure, so that the projects of the legislature are put into execution,
although its immediate attention may be directed to other objects.

in [[america]] [[certain]] ameliorations are undertaken with much more zeal and
activity than elsewhere; in [[europe]] the same ends are promoted by much
less social effort, more continuously applied.

some years ago several pious individuals [[individual]] undertook to ameliorate the
condition of the prisons. the [[public]] was excited by the statements
which they put forward, and the regeneration of criminals [[criminal]] became a very
popular undertaking. new prisons were built, and for the first [[time]] the
idea of reforming as well as of punishing the delinquent formed a part
of prison discipline. but this [[happy]] alteration, in which the [[public]] had
taken so hearty an interest, and which the exertions of the [[citizens]] had
irresistibly accelerated, could not be completed in a moment. whilst the
new penitentiaries were being erected (and it was the [[pleasure]] of the
majority that they should be terminated with all possible celerity), the
old prisons existed, which still contained a [[great]] number of offenders.
these jails became more unwholesome and more [[corrupt]] in proportion as
the new establishments were beautified and improved, forming a contrast
which may readily be understood. the majority was so eagerly employed
in founding the new prisons that those which already existed were
forgotten; and as the general attention was diverted to a novel object,
the [[care]] which had hitherto been bestowed upon the others ceased. the
salutary regulations of discipline were first relaxed, and afterwards
broken; so that in the immediate neighborhood of a prison which bore
witness to the mild and enlightened spirit of our [[time]], dungeons might
be met with which reminded the visitor of the barbarity of the middle
ages.




chapter xv: unlimited [[power]] of majority, and its consequences--part ii

tyranny of the majority

how the [[principle]] of the sovereignty of the [[people]] is to be
understood--impossibility of conceiving a mixed government--the
sovereign [[power]] must centre somewhere--precautions to be taken to
control its action--these precautions have not been taken in the united
states--consequences.

i hold it to be an impious and an execrable [[maxim]] that, politically
speaking, a [[people]] has a [[right]] to do whatsoever it pleases, and yet i
have asserted that all [[authority]] originates in the will of the majority.
am i then, in contradiction with myself?

a general law--which bears the name of justice--has been made and
sanctioned, not only by a majority of this or that [[people]], but by
a majority of [[mankind]]. the rights [[right]] of every [[people]] are consequently
confined within the limits of what is just. a nation may be considered
in the [[light]] of a jury which is empowered to represent [[society]] at large,
and to apply the [[great]] and general [[law]] of [[justice]]. ought such a jury,
which represents [[society]], to have more [[power]] than the [[society]] in which
the laws [[law]] it applies originate?

when i refuse to obey an [[unjust]] [[law]], i do not contest the [[right]] which
the majority has of commanding, but i simply appeal from the sovereignty
of the [[people]] to the sovereignty of [[mankind]]. it has been asserted that
a [[people]] can never entirely outstep the boundaries of [[justice]] and of
reason in those affairs which are more peculiarly its own, and that
consequently, full [[power]] may fearlessly be given to the majority by
which it is represented. but this [[language]] is that of a [[slave]].

a majority taken collectively may be regarded as a being whose opinions [[opinion]],
and most frequently whose interests, are opposed to those of another
being, which is styled a minority. if it be admitted that a [[man]],
possessing absolute [[power]], may misuse that [[power]] by wronging his
adversaries, why should a majority not be liable to the same reproach?
men are not apt to [[change]] their characters [[character]] by agglomeration; nor
does their patience in the presence of obstacles increase with the
consciousness of their [[strength]]. *c and for these reasons [[reason]] i can never
willingly invest any number of my fellow-creatures with that unlimited
authority which i should refuse to any one of them.

[footnote c: no one will assert that a [[people]] cannot forcibly wrong
another [[people]]; but parties may be looked upon as lesser nations within
a greater one, and they are aliens to each other: if, therefore, it be
admitted that a nation can act tyrannically towards another nation, it
cannot be denied that a party may do the same towards another party.]

i do not [[think]] that it is possible to combine several principles [[principle]] in the
same [[government]], so as at the same [[time]] to maintain [[freedom]], and really
to oppose them to one another. the form of [[government]] which is usually
termed mixed has always appeared to me to be a mere chimera. accurately
speaking there is no such thing as a mixed [[government]] (with the meaning
usually given to that word), because in all communities [[community]] some one
principle of action may be discovered which preponderates over the
others. [[england]] in the [[last]] century, which has been more especially
cited as an [[example]] of this form of [[government]], was in point of fact
an essentially aristocratic [[state]], although it comprised very powerful
elements of [[democracy]]; for the laws [[law]] and customs of the [[country]] were such
that the [[aristocracy]] could not but preponderate in the end, and subject
the direction of [[public]] affairs to its own will. the error arose from
too much attention being paid to the actual struggle which was going
on between the nobles [[noble]] and the [[people]], without considering the probable
issue of the contest, which was in reality the important point. when
a [[community]] really has a mixed [[government]], that is to say, when it is
equally divided between two adverse principles [[principle]], it must either pass
through a [[revolution]] or fall into complete dissolution.

i am therefore of [[opinion]] that some one social [[power]] must always be made
to predominate over the others; but i [[think]] that [[liberty]] is endangered
when this [[power]] is checked by no obstacles which may retard its course,
and [[force]] it to moderate its own vehemence.

unlimited [[power]] is in itself a [[bad]] and dangerous thing; [[human]] beings
are not competent to exercise it with discretion, and [[god]] alone can be
omnipotent, because his [[wisdom]] and his [[justice]] are always [[equal]] to his
power. but no [[power]] upon [[earth]] is so worthy of [[honor]] for itself, or of
reverential [[obedience]] to the rights [[right]] which it represents, that i would
consent to admit its uncontrolled and all-predominant [[authority]]. when i
see that the [[right]] and the means of absolute command are conferred on a
people or upon a [[king]], upon an [[aristocracy]] or a [[democracy]], a [[monarchy]] or
a [[republic]], i recognize the germ of [[tyranny]], and i [[journey]] onward to a
land of more hopeful [[institutions]].

in my [[opinion]] the main [[evil]] of the [[present]] democratic [[institutions]] of
the [[united]] states does not arise, as is often asserted in [[europe]], from
their weakness, but from their overpowering [[strength]]; and i am not so
much alarmed at the excessive [[liberty]] which reigns in that [[country]] as at
the very inadequate securities which [[exist]] against [[tyranny]].

when an [[individual]] or a party is wronged in the [[united]] states, to
whom can he apply for redress? if to [[public]] [[opinion]], [[public]] opinion
constitutes the majority; if to the legislature, it represents the
majority, and implicitly obeys its injunctions; if to the executive
power, it is appointed by the majority, and remains a passive tool in
its hands; the [[public]] [[troops]] consist of the majority under arms; the
jury is the majority invested with the [[right]] of hearing judicial cases;
and in [[certain]] states even the judges [[judge]] are elected by the majority.
however iniquitous or absurd the [[evil]] of which you [[complain]] may be, you
must submit to it as well as you can. *d

[footnote d: a striking instance of the excesses which may be occasioned
by the despotism of the majority occurred at baltimore in the year 1812.
at that [[time]] the [[war]] was very popular in baltimore. a journal which
had taken the other side of the [[question]] excited the indignation of
the inhabitants by its opposition. the populace assembled, broke the
printing-presses, and attacked the houses of the newspaper editors. the
militia was called out, but no one obeyed the call; and the only means
of saving the [[poor]] wretches who were threatened by the frenzy of the
mob was to throw them into prison as [[common]] malefactors. but even this
precaution was ineffectual; the mob collected again during the night,
the magistrates again made a [[vain]] attempt to call out the militia, the
prison was forced, one of the newspaper editors was killed upon the
spot, and the others were left for [[dead]]; the guilty parties were
acquitted by the jury when they were brought to [[trial]].

i said one day to an inhabitant of pennsylvania, "be so [[good]] as to
explain to me how it happens that in a [[state]] founded by quakers, and
celebrated for its toleration, freed blacks are not allowed to exercise
civil rights [[right]]. they [[pay]] the taxes; is it not [[fair]] that they should have a
vote?"

"you insult us," replied my informant, "if you imagine that our
legislators could have committed so gross an act of [[injustice]] and
intolerance."

"what! then the blacks possess the [[right]] of voting in this county?"

"without the smallest [[doubt]]."

"how comes it, then, that at the polling-booth this morning i did not
perceive a [[single]] negro in the whole meeting?"

"this is not the [[fault]] of the [[law]]: the negroes have an undisputed right
of voting, but they voluntarily abstain from making their appearance."

"a very pretty piece of modesty on their parts!" rejoined i.

"why, the [[truth]] is, that they are not disinclined to vote, but they are
afraid of being maltreated; in this [[country]] the [[law]] is sometimes unable
to maintain its [[authority]] without the support of the majority. but in
this case the majority entertains very [[strong]] prejudices against the
blacks, and the magistrates are unable to [[protect]] them in the exercise
of their legal privileges [[privilege]]."

"what! then the majority claims the [[right]] not only of making the laws [[law]],
but of breaking the laws [[law]] it has made?"]

if, on the other hand, a legislative [[power]] could be so constituted as
to represent the majority without necessarily being the [[slave]] of its
passions; an executive, so as to retain a [[certain]] [[degree]] of uncontrolled
authority; and a judiciary, so as to remain independent of the two other
powers; a [[government]] would be formed which would still be democratic
without incurring any risk of [[tyrannical]] [[abuse]].

i do not say that [[tyrannical]] abuses [[abuse]] frequently occur in [[america]] at the
present day, but i maintain that no sure barrier is established against
them, and that the causes which mitigate the [[government]] are to be found
in the circumstances and the manners of the [[country]] more than in its
laws.

effects of the unlimited [[power]] of the majority upon the arbitrary
authority of the american [[public]] officers

liberty left by the american laws [[law]] to [[public]] officers within a certain
sphere--their [[power]].


a distinction must be drawn between [[tyranny]] and arbitrary [[power]].
tyranny may be exercised by means of the [[law]], and in that case it is
not arbitrary; arbitrary [[power]] may be exercised for the [[good]] of the
community at large, in which case it is not [[tyrannical]]. [[tyranny]] usually
employs arbitrary means, but, if necessary, it can [[rule]] without them.

in the [[united]] states the unbounded [[power]] of the majority, which is
favorable to the legal despotism of the legislature, is likewise
favorable to the arbitrary [[authority]] of the magistrate. the majority has
an entire control over the [[law]] when it is made and when it is executed;
and as it possesses an [[equal]] [[authority]] over those who are in [[power]] and
the [[community]] at large, it considers [[public]] officers as its passive
agents, and readily confides the task of serving its designs to their
vigilance. the details of their office and the privileges [[privilege]] which they are
to enjoy are rarely defined beforehand; but the majority treats them as
a master does his servants when they are always at [[work]] in his sight,
and he has the [[power]] of directing or reprimanding them at every instant.

in general the american functionaries are far more independent than the
french civil officers within the sphere which is prescribed to them.
sometimes, even, they are allowed by the popular [[authority]] to exceed
those bounds; and as they are protected by the [[opinion]], and backed by
the co-operation, of the majority, they venture upon such manifestations
of their [[power]] as astonish a [[european]]. by this means habits are formed
in the [[heart]] of a [[free]] [[country]] which may some day prove fatal to its
liberties.

power exercised by the majority in [[america]] upon opinion

in [[america]], when the majority has once irrevocably decided a [[question]],
all discussion ceases--reason of this--moral [[power]] exercised by the
majority upon opinion--democratic republics [[republic]] have deprived despotism of
its physical instruments--their despotism sways the minds [[mind]] of [[men]].

it is in the examination of the display of [[public]] [[opinion]] in the united
states that we clearly perceive how far the [[power]] of the majority
surpasses all the powers [[power]] with which we are acquainted in [[europe]].
intellectual principles [[principle]] exercise an influence which is so invisible, and
often so inappreciable, that they baffle the toils of oppression. at the
present [[time]] the most absolute monarchs in [[europe]] are unable to prevent
certain notions, which are opposed to their [[authority]], from circulating
in secret throughout their dominions, and even in their courts. such
is not the case in [[america]]; as long as the majority is still undecided,
discussion is carried on; but as soon as its decision is irrevocably
pronounced, a submissive [[silence]] is observed, and the [[friends]], as well
as the opponents, of the measure unite in assenting to its propriety.
the [[reason]] of this is perfectly clear: no monarch is so absolute as to
combine all the powers [[power]] of [[society]] in his own hands, and to conquer all
opposition with the energy of a majority which is invested with the
right of making and of executing the laws [[law]].

the [[authority]] of a [[king]] is purely physical, and it controls the actions
of the [[subject]] without subduing his private will; but the majority
possesses a [[power]] which is physical and [[moral]] at the same [[time]]; it acts
upon the will as well as upon the actions of [[men]], and it represses not
only all contest, but all controversy. i [[know]] no [[country]] in which there
is so little true independence of [[mind]] and [[freedom]] of discussion as in
america. in any constitutional [[state]] in [[europe]] every sort of religious
and [[political]] theory may be advocated and propagated abroad; for there
is no [[country]] in [[europe]] so subdued by any [[single]] [[authority]] as not to
contain [[citizens]] who are ready to [[protect]] the [[man]] who raises his voice
in the cause of [[truth]] from the consequences of his hardihood. if he is
unfortunate enough to [[live]] under an absolute [[government]], the people
is upon his side; if he inhabits a [[free]] [[country]], he may find a shelter
behind the [[authority]] of the [[throne]], if he require one. the aristocratic
part of [[society]] supports him in some countries [[country]], and the [[democracy]] in
others. but in a nation where democratic [[institutions]] [[exist]], organized
like those of the [[united]] states, there is but one sole [[authority]], one
single element of [[strength]] and of [[success]], with nothing beyond it.

in [[america]] the majority raises very formidable barriers to the liberty
of [[opinion]]: within these barriers an author may write whatever he
pleases, but he will repent it if he ever step beyond them. not that he
is exposed to the terrors of an auto-da-fe, but he is tormented by
the slights and persecutions of daily obloquy. his [[political]] [[career]] is
closed forever, since he has offended the only [[authority]] which is
able to promote his [[success]]. every sort of compensation, even that
of celebrity, is refused to him. before he published his opinions [[opinion]] he
imagined that he held them in [[common]] with many others; but no sooner has
he declared them openly than he is loudly censured by his overbearing
opponents, whilst those who [[think]] without having the [[courage]] to speak,
like him, abandon him in [[silence]]. he yields at length, [[oppressed]] by the
daily efforts he has been making, and he subsides into [[silence]], as if he
was tormented by remorse for having spoken the [[truth]].

fetters and headsmen were the coarse instruments which [[tyranny]] formerly
employed; but the [[civilization]] of our [[age]] has refined the [[arts]] of
despotism which seemed, however, to have been sufficiently perfected
before. the excesses of monarchical [[power]] had devised a variety of
physical means of oppression: the democratic republics [[republic]] of the present
day have rendered it as entirely an affair of the [[mind]] as that will
which it is intended to coerce. under the absolute sway of an individual
despot the [[body]] was attacked in order to subdue the [[soul]], and the soul
escaped the blows which were directed against it and rose superior to
the attempt; but such is not the course adopted by [[tyranny]] in democratic
republics; there the [[body]] is left [[free]], and the [[soul]] is enslaved. the
sovereign can no longer say, "you shall [[think]] as i do on [[pain]] of [[death]];"
but he says, "you are [[free]] to [[think]] differently from me, and to retain
your [[life]], your [[property]], and all that you possess; but if such be your
determination, you are henceforth an alien among your [[people]]. you may
retain your civil rights [[right]], but they will be useless to you, for you will
never be chosen by your fellow-citizens if you solicit their suffrages,
and they will affect to scorn you if you solicit their esteem. you will
remain among [[men]], but you will be deprived of the rights [[right]] of [[mankind]].
your fellow-creatures will shun you like an impure being, and those who
are most persuaded of your innocence will abandon you too, lest they
should be shunned in their turn. go in peace! i have given you your
life, but it is an existence in comparably worse than [[death]]."

monarchical [[institutions]] have thrown an odium upon despotism; let us
beware lest democratic republics [[republic]] should restore oppression, and should
render it less odious and less degrading in the [[eyes]] of the many, by
making it still more onerous to the few.

works have been published in the proudest nations of the old world
expressly intended to censure the vices [[vice]] and deride the follies of the
times; labruyere inhabited the palace of louis xiv when he composed his
chapter upon the [[great]], and moliere criticised the courtiers in the very
pieces which were acted before the court. but the ruling [[power]] in the
united states is not to be made game of; the smallest reproach irritates
its sensibility, and the slightest joke which has any foundation in
truth renders it indignant; from the style of its [[language]] to the more
solid virtues [[virtue]] of its [[character]], everything must be made the subject
of encomium. no writer, whatever be his eminence, can escape from this
tribute of adulation to his fellow-citizens. the majority lives [[life]] in the
perpetual practice of self-applause, and there are [[certain]] truths [[truth]] which
the americans can only learn from strangers or from [[experience]].

if [[great]] writers have not at [[present]] existed in [[america]], the reason
is very simply given in these facts [[fact]]; there can be no literary genius
without [[freedom]] of [[opinion]], and [[freedom]] of [[opinion]] does not [[exist]] in
america. the inquisition has never been able to prevent a vast number
of anti-religious books [[book]] from circulating in [[spain]]. the [[empire]] of the
majority succeeds much [[better]] in the [[united]] states, since it actually
removes the [[wish]] of publishing them. unbelievers are to be met with in
america, but, to say the [[truth]], there is no [[public]] organ of infidelity.
attempts have been made by some governments [[government]] to [[protect]] the morality of
nations by prohibiting licentious books [[book]]. in the [[united]] states no one is
punished for this sort of works [[work]], but no one is induced to write them;
not because all the [[citizens]] are immaculate in their manners, but
because the majority of the [[community]] is decent and orderly.


in these cases the advantages derived from the exercise of this power
are unquestionable, and i am simply discussing the [[nature]] of the
power itself. this irresistible [[authority]] is a constant [[fact]], and its
judicious exercise is an accidental occurrence.

effects of the [[tyranny]] of the majority upon the national [[character]] of
the americans

effects of the [[tyranny]] of the majority more sensibly [[felt]] hitherto in
the manners than in the conduct of society--they check the development
of leading characters--democratic republics [[republic]] organized like the united
states bring the practice of courting favor within the reach of the
many--proofs of this spirit in the [[united]] states--why there is more
patriotism in the [[people]] than in those who govern in its name.

the tendencies which i have just alluded to are as yet very slightly
perceptible in [[political]] [[society]], but they already begin to exercise an
unfavorable influence upon the national [[character]] of the americans. i
am inclined to attribute the singular paucity of distinguished political
characters to the ever-increasing activity of the despotism of the
majority in the [[united]] states. when the american [[revolution]] broke out
they arose in [[great]] numbers, for [[public]] [[opinion]] then served, not to
tyrannize over, but to direct the exertions of individuals [[individual]]. those
celebrated [[men]] took a full part in the general agitation of [[mind]] common
at that period, and they attained a high [[degree]] of personal fame, which
was reflected back upon the nation, but which was by no means borrowed
from it.

in absolute governments [[government]] the [[great]] nobles [[noble]] who are nearest to the throne
flatter the [[passions]] of the [[sovereign]], and voluntarily truckle to
his caprices. but the mass of the nation does not degrade itself
by servitude: it often submits from weakness, from habit, or from
ignorance, and sometimes from loyalty. some nations have been known to
sacrifice their own desires [[desire]] to those of the [[sovereign]] with [[pleasure]] and
with [[pride]], thus exhibiting a sort of independence in the very act of
submission. these peoples [[people]] are miserable, but they are not degraded.
there is a [[great]] difference between doing what one does not approve and
feigning to approve what one does; the one is the necessary case of a
weak [[person]], the other befits the temper of a lackey.

in [[free]] countries [[country]], where everyone is more or less called upon to give
his [[opinion]] in the affairs of [[state]]; in democratic republics [[republic]], where
public [[life]] is incessantly commingled with domestic affairs, where the
sovereign [[authority]] is accessible on every side, and where its attention
can almost always be attracted by vociferation, more persons [[person]] are to
be met with who speculate upon its foibles and [[live]] at the cost of its
passions than in absolute monarchies [[monarchy]]. not because [[men]] are naturally
worse in these states than elsewhere, but the temptation is stronger,
and of easier access at the same [[time]]. the result is a far more
extensive debasement of the characters [[character]] of [[citizens]].


democratic republics [[republic]] extend the practice of currying favor with the
many, and they introduce it into a greater number of classes at once:
this is one of the most serious reproaches that can be addressed to
them. in democratic states organized on the principles [[principle]] of the american
republics, this is more especially the case, where the [[authority]] of the
majority is so absolute and so irresistible that a [[man]] must give up his
rights as a citizen, and almost abjure his quality as a [[human]] being, if
te intends to stray from the track which it lays down.

in that immense crowd which throngs the avenues to [[power]] in the united
states i found very few [[men]] who displayed any of that manly candor and
that masculine independence of [[opinion]] which frequently distinguished
the americans in former times [[time]], and which constitutes the leading feature
in distinguished characters [[character]], wheresoever they may be found. it seems, at
first sight, as if all the minds [[mind]] of the americans were formed upon one
model, so accurately do they correspond in their manner of judging. a
stranger does, indeed, sometimes meet with americans who dissent from
these rigorous formularies; with [[men]] who deplore the defects of the
laws, the mutability and the ignorance of [[democracy]]; who even go so far
as to observe the [[evil]] tendencies which impair the national [[character]],
and to point out such remedies as it might be possible to apply; but
no one is there to hear these things besides yourself, and you, to whom
these secret reflections are confided, are a stranger and a bird of
passage. they are very ready to communicate truths [[truth]] which are useless to
you, but they continue to hold a different [[language]] in [[public]].

if ever these lines are [[read]] in [[america]], i am well assured of two
things: in the first place, that all who peruse them will raise their
voices to condemn me; and in the second place, that very many of them
will acquit me at the bottom of their [[conscience]].

i have heard of [[patriotism]] in the [[united]] states, and it is a virtue
which may be found among the [[people]], but never among the leaders of
the [[people]]. this may be explained by analogy; despotism debases the
oppressed much more than the oppressor: in absolute monarchies [[monarchy]] the king
has often [[great]] virtues [[virtue]], but the courtiers are invariably servile. it is
true that the american courtiers do not say "sire," or "your majesty"--a
distinction without a difference. they are forever talking of the
natural [[intelligence]] of the populace they serve; they do not debate the
question as to which of the virtues [[virtue]] of their master is pre-eminently
worthy of admiration, for they assure him that he possesses all the
virtues under [[heaven]] without having acquired them, or without caring to
acquire them; they do not give him their daughters [[daughter]] and their wives [[wife]] to
be raised at his [[pleasure]] to the rank of his concubines, but, by
sacrificing their opinions [[opinion]], they prostitute themselves. moralists and
philosophers in [[america]] are not obliged to conceal their opinions [[opinion]] under
the veil of allegory; but, before they venture upon a harsh [[truth]],
they say, "we are aware that the [[people]] which we are addressing is too
superior to all the weaknesses of [[human]] [[nature]] to lose the command of
its temper for an instant; and we should not hold this [[language]] if
we were not speaking to [[men]] whom their virtues [[virtue]] and their intelligence
render more worthy of [[freedom]] than all the rest of the [[world]]." it would
have been impossible for the sycophants of louis xiv to flatter more
dexterously. for my part, i am persuaded that in all governments [[government]],
whatever their [[nature]] may be, servility will cower to [[force]], and
adulation will cling to [[power]]. the only means of preventing [[men]] from
degrading themselves is to invest no one with that unlimited authority
which is the surest method of debasing them.

the [[greatest]] dangers of the american republics [[republic]] proceed from the
unlimited [[power]] of the majority

democratic republics [[republic]] liable to perish from a misuse of their [[power]], and
not by impotence--the governments [[government]] of the american republics [[republic]] are
more centralized and more energetic than those of the monarchies [[monarchy]] of
europe--dangers resulting from this--opinions of hamilton and jefferson
upon this point.

governments usually fall a [[sacrifice]] to impotence or to [[tyranny]]. in
the former case their [[power]] escapes from them; it is wrested from their
grasp in the latter. many observers, who have witnessed the [[anarchy]] of
democratic states, have imagined that the [[government]] of those states was
naturally [[weak]] and impotent. the [[truth]] is, that when once hostilities
are begun between parties, the [[government]] loses its control over
society. but i do not [[think]] that a democratic [[power]] is naturally without
force or without resources: say, rather, that it is almost always by
the [[abuse]] of its [[force]] and the misemployment of its resources that a
democratic [[government]] fails. [[anarchy]] is almost always produced by its
tyranny or its mistakes, but not by its want of [[strength]].

it is important not to confound stability with [[force]], or the greatness
of a thing with its duration. in democratic republics [[republic]], the [[power]] which
directs *e [[society]] is not stable; for it often changes [[change]] hands and
assumes a new direction. but whichever way it turns, its [[force]] is almost
irresistible. the governments [[government]] of the american republics [[republic]] appear to me to
be as much centralized as those of the absolute monarchies [[monarchy]] of [[europe]],
and more energetic than they are. i do not, therefore, imagine that they
will perish from weakness. *f

[footnote e: this [[power]] may be centred in an assembly, in which case
it will be [[strong]] without being stable; or it may be centred in an
individual, in which case it will be less [[strong]], but more stable.]

[footnote f: i presume that it is scarcely necessary to remind the
reader here, as well as throughout the remainder of this [[chapter]], that
i am speaking, not of the federal [[government]], but of the several
governments of each [[state]], which the majority controls at its [[pleasure]].]

if ever the [[free]] [[institutions]] of [[america]] are destroyed, that event may
be attributed to the unlimited [[authority]] of the majority, which may at
some future [[time]] urge the minorities to desperation, and oblige them to
have recourse to physical [[force]]. [[anarchy]] will then be the result, but it
will have been brought about by despotism.

mr. hamilton expresses the same [[opinion]] in the "federalist," no. 51.
"it is of [[great]] importance in a [[republic]] not only to guard the society
against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the
society against the [[injustice]] of the other part. [[justice]] is the end of
government. it is the end of civil [[society]]. it ever has been, and ever
will be, pursued until it be obtained, or until [[liberty]] be lost in the
pursuit. in a [[society]], under the forms of which the stronger faction can
readily unite and [[oppress]] the weaker, [[anarchy]] may as truly be said
to reign as in a [[state]] of [[nature]], where the weaker [[individual]] is not
secured against the [[violence]] of the stronger: and as in the latter state
even the stronger individuals [[individual]] are prompted by the uncertainty of their
condition to submit to a [[government]] which may [[protect]] the [[weak]] as well
as themselves, so in the former [[state]] will the more powerful factions be
gradually induced by a like motive to [[wish]] for a [[government]] which will
protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful. it can be
little doubted that, if the [[state]] of rhode island was separated from
the confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of [[right]] under the
popular form of [[government]] within such narrow limits would be displayed
by such reiterated oppressions of the factious majorities, that some
power altogether independent of the [[people]] would soon be called for by
the voice of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of
it."

jefferson has also thus expressed himself in a letter to madison: *g
"the executive [[power]] in our [[government]] is not the only, perhaps not even
the principal, object of my solicitude. the [[tyranny]] of the legislature
is really the danger most to be feared, and will continue to be so for
many years to come. the [[tyranny]] of the executive [[power]] will come in its
turn, but at a more distant period." i am glad to cite the opinion
of jefferson upon this [[subject]] rather than that of another, because i
consider him to be the most powerful advocate [[democracy]] has ever sent
forth.

[footnote g: march 15, 1789.]




chapter xvi: causes mitigating [[tyranny]] in the [[united]] states--part i

chapter summary

the national majority does not pretend to conduct all business--is
obliged to employ the town and county magistrates to execute its supreme
decisions.

i have already pointed out the distinction which is to be made between
a centralized [[government]] and a centralized administration. the former
exists in [[america]], but the latter is nearly unknown there. if the
directing [[power]] of the american communities [[community]] had both these instruments
of [[government]] at its disposal, and [[united]] the habit of executing its own
commands to the [[right]] of commanding; if, after having established the
general principles [[principle]] of [[government]], it descended to the details of public
business; and if, having regulated the [[great]] interests of the [[country]],
it could penetrate into the privacy of [[individual]] interests, freedom
would soon be [[banished]] from the new [[world]].

but in the [[united]] states the majority, which so frequently displays the
tastes and the propensities of a despot, is still destitute of the more
perfect instruments of [[tyranny]]. in the american republics [[republic]] the activity
of the central [[government]] has never as yet been extended beyond a
limited number of objects sufficiently prominent to call forth its
attention. the secondary affairs of [[society]] have never been regulated
by its [[authority]], and nothing has hitherto betrayed its [[desire]] of
interfering in them. the majority is become more and more absolute, but
it has not increased the prerogatives of the central [[government]]; those
great prerogatives have been confined to a [[certain]] sphere; and although
the despotism of the majority may be galling upon one point, it cannot
be said to extend to all. however the predominant party in the nation
may be carried away by its [[passions]], however ardent it may be in the
pursuit of its projects, it cannot oblige all the [[citizens]] to comply
with its desires [[desire]] in the same manner and at the same [[time]] throughout the
country. when the central [[government]] which represents that majority has
issued a decree, it must entrust the execution of its will to agents,
over whom it frequently has no control, and whom it cannot perpetually
direct. the townships, municipal bodies [[body]], and counties may therefore be
looked upon as concealed break-waters, which check or part the tide of
popular excitement. if an oppressive [[law]] were passed, the liberties [[liberty]] of
the [[people]] would still be protected by the means by which that [[law]] would
be put in execution: the majority cannot descend to the details and (as
i will venture to style them) the puerilities of administrative [[tyranny]].
nor does the [[people]] entertain that full [[consciousness]] of its authority
which would prompt it to interfere in these matters; it knows [[know]] the
extent of its [[natural]] powers [[power]], but it is unacquainted with the increased
resources which the art [[arts]] of [[government]] might furnish.

this point deserves attention, for if a democratic [[republic]] similar to
that of the [[united]] states were ever founded in a [[country]] where the power
of a [[single]] [[individual]] had previously subsisted, and the effects of a
centralized administration had sunk deep into the habits and the laws
of the [[people]], i do not hesitate to assert, that in that [[country]] a more
insufferable despotism would prevail than any which now exists in the
monarchical states of [[europe]], or indeed than any which could be found on
this side of the confines of [[asia]].

the profession of the [[law]] in the [[united]] states serves to counterpoise
the democracy

utility of discriminating the [[natural]] propensities of the members of
the legal profession--these [[men]] called upon to act a prominent part in
future society--in what manner the peculiar pursuits of lawyers give an
aristocratic turn to their ideas--accidental causes which may check this
tendency--ease with which the [[aristocracy]] coalesces with legal men--use
of lawyers to a despot--the profession of the [[law]] constitutes the only
aristocratic element with which the [[natural]] elements of [[democracy]] will
combine--peculiar causes which tend to give an aristocratic turn of mind
to the english and american lawyers--the [[aristocracy]] of [[america]] is
on the bench and at the bar--influence of lawyers upon american
society--their peculiar magisterial habits affect the legislature, the
administration, and even the [[people]].

in visiting the americans and in studying their laws [[law]] we perceive that
the [[authority]] they have entrusted to members of the legal profession,
and the influence which these individuals [[individual]] exercise in the [[government]], is
the most powerful existing security against the excesses of [[democracy]].
this effect seems to me to result from a general cause which it is
useful to investigate, since it may [[produce]] analogous consequences
elsewhere.

the members of the legal profession have taken an important part in all
the vicissitudes of [[political]] [[society]] in [[europe]] during the [[last]] five
hundred years. at one [[time]] they have been the instruments of those
who were invested with [[political]] [[authority]], and at another they have
succeeded in converting [[political]] authorities [[authority]] into their instrument. in
the middle ages [[age]] they afforded a powerful support to the [[crown]], and since
that period they have exerted themselves to the utmost to limit the
royal prerogative. in [[england]] they have contracted a close [[alliance]] with
the [[aristocracy]]; in [[france]] they have proved to be the most dangerous
enemies of that class. it is my object to inquire whether, under all
these circumstances, the members of the legal profession have been
swayed by sudden and momentary impulses; or whether they have been
impelled by principles [[principle]] which are inherent in their pursuits, and which
will always recur in [[history]]. i am incited to this investigation by
reflecting that this particular class of [[men]] will most likely play a
prominent part in that order of things to which the events of our time
are giving birth.

men who have more especially devoted themselves to legal pursuits derive
from those occupations [[certain]] habits of order, a taste for formalities,
and a [[kind]] of instinctive regard for the regular connection of ideas [[idea]],
which naturally render them very hostile to the revolutionary spirit and
the unreflecting [[passions]] of the multitude.

the special information which lawyers derive from their studies ensures
them a separate station in [[society]], and they constitute a sort of
privileged [[body]] in the scale of [[intelligence]]. this notion of their
superiority perpetually recurs to them in the practice of their
profession: they are the masters of a [[science]] which is necessary, but
which is not very generally known; they serve as arbiters between the
citizens; and the habit of directing the blind [[passions]] of parties in
litigation to their [[purpose]] inspires them with a [[certain]] contempt
for the [[judgment]] of the multitude. to this it may be added that they
naturally constitute a [[body]], not by any previous understanding, or by an
agreement which directs them to a [[common]] end; but the analogy of their
studies and the uniformity of their proceedings connect their minds
together, as much as a [[common]] interest could combine their endeavors.

a portion of the tastes and of the habits of the [[aristocracy]] may
consequently be discovered in the characters [[character]] of [[men]] in the profession of
the [[law]]. they participate in the same instinctive [[love]] of order and of
formalities; and they entertain the same repugnance to the actions of
the multitude, and the same secret contempt of the [[government]] of the
people. i do not mean to say that the [[natural]] propensities of lawyers
are sufficiently [[strong]] to sway them irresistibly; for they, like most
other [[men]], are governed by their private interests and the advantages of
the moment.

in a [[state]] of [[society]] in which the members of the legal profession are
prevented from holding that rank in the [[political]] [[world]] which they enjoy
in private [[life]], we may rest assured that they will be the foremost
agents of [[revolution]]. but it must then be inquired whether the cause
which induces them to innovate and to [[destroy]] is accidental, or whether
it belongs to some lasting [[purpose]] which they entertain. it is true that
lawyers mainly contributed to the overthrow of the french [[monarchy]] in
1789; but it remains to be seen whether they acted thus because they had
studied the laws [[law]], or because they were prohibited from co-operating in
the [[work]] of legislation.

five hundred years ago the english nobles [[noble]] headed the [[people]], and spoke
in its name; at the [[present]] [[time]] the [[aristocracy]] supports the [[throne]],
and defends the [[royal]] prerogative. but [[aristocracy]] has, notwithstanding
this, its peculiar instincts and propensities. we must be careful not
to confound isolated members of a [[body]] with the [[body]] itself. in all
free governments [[government]], of whatsoever form they may be, members of the legal
profession will be found at the head of all parties. the same remark
is also applicable to the [[aristocracy]]; for almost all the democratic
convulsions which have agitated the [[world]] have been directed by nobles [[noble]].

a privileged [[body]] can never satisfy the [[ambition]] of all its members; it
has always more [[talents]] and more [[passions]] to content and to employ than
it can find places; so that a considerable number of individuals [[individual]] are
usually to be met with who are inclined to attack those very privileges
which they find it impossible to turn to their own account.

i do not, then, assert that all the members of the legal profession are
at all times [[time]] the [[friends]] of order and the opponents of innovation, but
merely that most of them usually are so. in a [[community]] in which lawyers
are allowed to occupy, without opposition, that high station which
naturally belongs to them, their general spirit will be eminently
conservative and anti-democratic. when an [[aristocracy]] excludes the
leaders of that profession from its ranks, it excites enemies [[enemy]] which
are the more formidable to its security as they are independent of the
nobility by their industrious pursuits; and they [[feel]] themselves to be
its [[equal]] in point of [[intelligence]], although they enjoy less opulence
and less [[power]]. but whenever an [[aristocracy]] consents to impart some of
its privileges [[privilege]] to these same individuals [[individual]], the two classes coalesce very
readily, and assume, as it were, the consistency of a [[single]] order of
family interests.

i am, in like manner, inclined to [[believe]] that a monarch will always
be able to convert legal practitioners into the most serviceable
instruments of his [[authority]]. there is a far greater affinity between
this class of individuals [[individual]] and the executive [[power]] than there is between
them and the [[people]]; just as there is a greater [[natural]] affinity between
the nobles [[noble]] and the monarch than between the nobles [[noble]] and the [[people]],
although the higher orders of [[society]] have occasionally resisted the
prerogative of the [[crown]] in concert with the lower classes.

lawyers are attached to [[public]] order beyond every other consideration,
and the [[best]] security of [[public]] order is [[authority]]. it must not be
forgotten that, if they prize the [[free]] [[institutions]] of their country
much, they nevertheless value the legality of those [[institutions]] far
more: they are less afraid of [[tyranny]] than of arbitrary [[power]]; and
provided that the legislature take upon itself to deprive [[men]] of their
independence, they are not dissatisfied.

i am therefore convinced that the [[prince]] who, in presence of an
encroaching [[democracy]], should endeavor to impair the judicial authority
in his dominions, and to diminish the [[political]] influence of lawyers,
would commit a [[great]] mistake. he would let slip the substance
of [[authority]] to grasp at the shadow. he would act more wisely in
introducing [[men]] connected with the [[law]] into the [[government]]; and if he
entrusted them with the conduct of a despotic [[power]], bearing some marks
of [[violence]], that [[power]] would most likely assume the external features
of [[justice]] and of legality in their hands.


the [[government]] of [[democracy]] is favorable to the [[political]] [[power]] of
lawyers; for when the wealthy, the [[noble]], and the [[prince]] are excluded
from the [[government]], they are sure to occupy the highest stations, in
their own [[right]], as it were, since they are the only [[men]] of information
and sagacity, beyond the sphere of the [[people]], who can be the object of
the popular [[choice]]. if, then, they are [[led]] by their tastes to combine
with the [[aristocracy]] and to support the [[crown]], they are naturally
brought into contact with the [[people]] by their interests. they like the
government of [[democracy]], without participating in its propensities
and without imitating its weaknesses; whence they derive a twofold
authority, from it and over it. the [[people]] in democratic states does not
mistrust the members of the legal profession, because it is well known
that they are interested in serving the popular cause; and it listens
to them without irritation, because it does not attribute to them any
sinister designs. the object of lawyers is not, indeed, to overthrow the
institutions of [[democracy]], but they constantly endeavor to give it an
impulse which diverts it from its real tendency, by means which are
foreign to its [[nature]]. lawyers belong to the [[people]] by birth and
interest, to the [[aristocracy]] by habit and by taste, and they may be
looked upon as the [[natural]] bond and connecting link of the two great
classes of [[society]].

the profession of the [[law]] is the only aristocratic element which can be
amalgamated without [[violence]] with the [[natural]] elements of [[democracy]], and
which can be advantageously and permanently combined with them. i am
not unacquainted with the defects which are inherent in the character
of that [[body]] of [[men]]; but without this admixture of lawyer-like
sobriety with the democratic [[principle]], i [[question]] whether democratic
institutions could long be maintained, and i cannot [[believe]] that a
republic could subsist at the [[present]] [[time]] if the influence of lawyers
in [[public]] [[business]] did not increase in proportion to the [[power]] of the
people.

this aristocratic [[character]], which i hold to be [[common]] to the legal
profession, is much more distinctly marked in the [[united]] states and in
england than in any other [[country]]. this proceeds not only from the legal
studies of the english and american lawyers, but from the [[nature]] of
the legislation, and the position which those persons [[person]] occupy in the
two countries [[country]]. the english and the americans have retained the [[law]] of
precedents; that is to say, they continue to found their legal opinions
and the decisions of their courts upon the opinions [[opinion]] and the decisions of
their forefathers. in the [[mind]] of an english or american lawyer a taste
and a reverence for what is old is almost always [[united]] to a [[love]] of
regular and lawful proceedings.

this predisposition has another effect upon the [[character]] of the legal
profession and upon the general course of [[society]]. the english and
american lawyers investigate what has been done; the french advocate
inquires what should have been done; the former [[produce]] precedents,
the latter reasons [[reason]]. a french observer is surprised to hear how often
an english dr an american lawyer quotes the opinions [[opinion]] of others, and how
little he alludes to his own; whilst the reverse occurs in [[france]]. there
the most trifling litigation is never conducted without the introduction
of an entire [[system]] of ideas [[idea]] peculiar to the counsel employed; and the
fundamental principles [[principle]] of [[law]] are discussed in order to obtain a
perch of [[land]] by the decision of the court. this abnegation of his own
opinion, and this implicit deference to the [[opinion]] of his forefathers,
which are [[common]] to the english and american lawyer, this subjection of
thought which he is obliged to profess, necessarily give him more timid
habits and more sluggish inclinations in [[england]] and [[america]] than in
france.

the french codes are often difficult of comprehension, but they can be
read by every one; nothing, on the other hand, can be more impenetrable
to the uninitiated than a legislation founded upon precedents. the
indispensable want of legal assistance which is [[felt]] in [[england]] and in
the [[united]] states, and the high [[opinion]] which is generally entertained
of the ability of the legal profession, tend to separate it more and
more from the [[people]], and to place it in a distinct class. the french
lawyer is simply a [[man]] extensively acquainted with the statutes of his
country; but the english or american lawyer resembles the hierophants of
egypt, for, like them, he is the sole interpreter of an occult [[science]].

the station which lawyers occupy in [[england]] and [[america]] exercises no
less an influence upon their habits and their opinions [[opinion]]. the english
aristocracy, which has taken [[care]] to attract to its sphere whatever is
at all analogous to itself, has conferred a high [[degree]] of importance
and of [[authority]] upon the members of the legal profession. in english
society lawyers do not occupy the first rank, but they are contented
with the station assigned to them; they constitute, as it were, the
younger branch of the english [[aristocracy]], and they are attached to
their elder brothers [[brother]], although they do not enjoy all their privileges [[privilege]].
the english lawyers consequently mingle the taste and the ideas [[idea]] of the
aristocratic circles in which they move with the aristocratic interests
of their profession.

and indeed the lawyer-like [[character]] which i am endeavoring to depict is
most distinctly to be met with in [[england]]: there laws [[law]] are esteemed not
so much because they are [[good]] as because they are old; and if it be
necessary to modify them in any [[respect]], or to adapt them the
changes which [[time]] operates in [[society]], recourse is had to the most
inconceivable contrivances in order to uphold the traditionary fabric,
and to maintain that nothing has been done which does not square with
the intentions and complete the labors of former generations [[generation]]. the
very individuals [[individual]] who conduct these changes [[change]] disclaim all intention of
innovation, and they had rather resort to absurd expedients than plead
guilty to so [[great]] a crime. this spirit appertains more especially to
the english lawyers; they seem indifferent to the real meaning of what
they treat, and they direct all their attention to the letter, seeming
inclined to infringe the rules [[rule]] of [[common]] sense and of [[humanity]] rather
than to swerve one title from the [[law]]. the english legislation may be
compared to the stock of an old tree, upon which lawyers have engrafted
the most various shoots, with the [[hope]] that, although their fruits may
differ, their foliage at least will be confounded with the venerable
trunk which supports them all.

in [[america]] there are no nobles [[noble]] or [[men]] of letters, and the [[people]] is apt
to mistrust the wealthy; lawyers consequently form the highest political
class, and the most cultivated circle of [[society]]. they have therefore
nothing to gain by innovation, which adds a conservative interest to
their [[natural]] taste for [[public]] order. if i were [[asked]] where i place the
american [[aristocracy]], i should reply without hesitation that it is not
composed of the [[rich]], who are [[united]] together by no [[common]] tie, but that
it occupies the judicial bench and the bar.

the more we reflect upon all that occurs in the [[united]] states the more
shall we be persuaded that the lawyers as a [[body]] form the most powerful,
if not the only, counterpoise to the democratic element. in that country
we perceive how eminently the legal profession is qualified by its
powers, and even by its defects, to neutralize the vices [[vice]] which are
inherent in popular [[government]]. when the american [[people]] is intoxicated
by passion, or carried away by the impetuosity of its ideas [[idea]], it is
checked and stopped by the almost invisible influence of its legal
counsellors, who secretly oppose their aristocratic propensities to its
democratic instincts, their [[superstitious]] attachment to what is antique
to its [[love]] of novelty, their narrow views to its immense designs, and
their habitual procrastination to its ardent [[impatience]].

the courts of [[justice]] are the most visible organs by which the legal
profession is enabled to control the [[democracy]]. the [[judge]] is a lawyer,
who, independently of the taste for regularity and order which he has
contracted in the study of legislation, derives an additional [[love]] of
stability from his own inalienable functions. his legal attainments have
already raised him to a distinguished rank amongst his fellow-citizens;
his [[political]] [[power]] completes the distinction of his station, and gives
him the inclinations [[natural]] to privileged classes.

armed with the [[power]] of declaring the laws [[law]] to be unconstitutional, *a
the american magistrate perpetually interferes in [[political]] affairs. he
cannot [[force]] the [[people]] to make laws [[law]], but at least he can oblige it not
to disobey its own enactments; or to act inconsistently with its own
principles. i am aware that a secret tendency to diminish the judicial
power exists in the [[united]] states, and by most of the constitutions [[constitution]] of
the several states the [[government]] can, upon the demand of the two houses
of the legislature, remove the judges [[judge]] from their station. by some other
constitutions the members of the tribunals are elected, and they are
even subjected to frequent re-elections. i venture to predict that these
innovations will sooner or later be attended with fatal consequences,
and that it will be found out at some future period that the attack
which is made upon the judicial [[power]] has affected the democratic
republic itself.

[footnote a: see [[chapter]] vi. on the "judicial [[power]] in the united
states."]

it must not, however, be supposed that the legal spirit of which i have
been speaking has been confined, in the [[united]] states, to the courts of
justice; it extends far beyond them. as the lawyers constitute the only
enlightened class which the [[people]] does not mistrust, they are naturally
called upon to occupy most of the [[public]] stations. they fill the
legislative assemblies, and they conduct the administration; they
consequently exercise a powerful influence upon the formation of the
law, and upon its execution. the lawyers are, however, obliged to yield
to the current of [[public]] [[opinion]], which is too [[strong]] for them to resist
it, but it is easy to find indications of what their conduct would be if
they were [[free]] to act as they chose. the americans, who have made such
copious innovations in their [[political]] legislation, have introduced very
sparing alterations in their civil laws [[law]], and that with [[great]] difficulty,
although those laws [[law]] are frequently repugnant to their social condition.
the [[reason]] of this is, that in matters of civil [[law]] the majority is
obliged to defer to the [[authority]] of the legal profession, and that the
american lawyers are disinclined to innovate when they are left to their
own [[choice]].

it is [[curious]] for a frenchman, accustomed to a very different [[state]] of
things, to hear the perpetual complaints which are made in the united
states against the stationary propensities of legal [[men]], and their
prejudices in favor of existing [[institutions]].

the influence of the legal habits which are [[common]] in [[america]] extends
beyond the limits i have just pointed out. scarcely any [[question]] arises
in the [[united]] states which does not become, sooner or later, a subject
of judicial debate; hence all parties are obliged to borrow the ideas [[idea]],
and even the [[language]], usual in judicial proceedings in their
daily controversies. as most [[public]] [[men]] are, or have been, legal
practitioners, they introduce the customs and technicalities of their
profession into the affairs of the [[country]]. the jury extends this
habitude to all classes. the [[language]] of the [[law]] thus becomes, in some
measure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of the [[law]], which is produced in
the schools and courts of [[justice]], gradually penetrates beyond their
walls into the bosom of [[society]], where it descends to the lowest
classes, so that the whole [[people]] contracts the habits and the tastes of
the magistrate. the lawyers of the [[united]] states form a party which is
but little feared and scarcely perceived, which has no badge peculiar to
itself, which adapts itself with [[great]] flexibility to the exigencies
of the [[time]], and accommodates itself to all the movements of the social
body; but this party extends over the whole [[community]], and it penetrates
into all classes of [[society]]; it acts upon the [[country]] imperceptibly, but
it finally fashions it to suit its purposes [[purpose]].




chapter xvi: causes mitigating [[tyranny]] in the [[united]] states--part ii

trial by jury in the [[united]] states considered as a [[political]] institution

trial by jury, which is one of the instruments of the sovereignty of the
people, deserves to be compared with the other laws [[law]] which establish that
sovereignty--composition of the jury in the [[united]] states--effect of
trial by jury upon the national character--it educates the people--it
tends to establish the [[authority]] of the magistrates and to extend a
knowledge of [[law]] among the [[people]].

since i have been [[led]] by my [[subject]] to recur to the administration of
justice in the [[united]] states, i will not pass over this point without
adverting to the institution of the jury. [[trial]] by jury may be
considered in two separate points of view, as a judicial and as a
political institution. if it entered into my [[present]] [[purpose]] to inquire
how far [[trial]] by jury (more especially in civil cases) contributes to
insure the [[best]] administration of [[justice]], i admit that its utility
might be contested. as the jury was first introduced at a [[time]] when
society was in an uncivilized [[state]], and when courts of [[justice]] were
merely called upon to decide on the evidence of facts [[fact]], it is not an easy
task to adapt it to the wants of a highly civilized [[community]] when the
mutual relations of [[men]] are multiplied to a surprising extent, and have
assumed the enlightened and intellectual [[character]] of the [[age]]. *b

[footnote b: the investigation of [[trial]] by jury as a judicial
institution, and the appreciation of its effects in the [[united]] states,
together with the advantages the americans have derived from it, would
suffice to form a [[book]], and a [[book]] upon a very useful and curious
subject. the [[state]] of louisiana would in particular afford the curious
phenomenon of a french and english legislation, as well as a french and
english [[population]], which are gradually combining with each other. see
the "digeste des lois de la louisiane," in two volumes; and the "traite
sur les regles des actions civiles," printed in french and english at
new orleans in 1830.]

my [[present]] object is to consider the jury as a [[political]] institution,
and any other course would divert me from my [[subject]]. of [[trial]] by jury,
considered as a judicial institution, i shall here say but very few
words. when the english adopted [[trial]] by jury they were a semi-barbarous
people; they are become, in course of [[time]], one of the most enlightened
nations of the [[earth]]; and their attachment to this institution seems
to have increased with their increasing cultivation. they soon spread
beyond their insular boundaries to every corner of the habitable globe;
some have formed colonies, others independent states; the mother-country
has maintained its monarchical [[constitution]]; many of its offspring have
founded powerful republics [[republic]]; but wherever the english have been they have
boasted of the [[privilege]] of [[trial]] by jury. *c they have established it,
or hastened to re-establish it, in all their settlements. a judicial
institution which obtains the suffrages of a [[great]] [[people]] for so long
a series of ages [[age]], which is zealously renewed at every epoch of
civilization, in all the climates of the [[earth]] and under every form of
human [[government]], cannot be contrary to the spirit of [[justice]]. *d

[footnote c: all the english and american jurists are unanimous upon
this head. mr. story, [[judge]] of the supreme court of the [[united]] states,
speaks, in his "treatise on the federal [[constitution]]," of the advantages
of [[trial]] by jury in civil cases:--"the inestimable [[privilege]] of a
trial by jury in civil cases--a [[privilege]] scarcely inferior to that
in [[criminal]] cases, which is counted by all persons [[person]] to be essential to
political and civil [[liberty]]. . . ." (story, [[book]] iii., chap. xxxviii.)]

[footnote d: if it were our province to point out the utility of the
jury as a judicial institution in this place, much might be said, and
the following arguments might be brought forward amongst others:--

by introducing the jury into the [[business]] of the courts you are enabled
to diminish the number of judges [[judge]], which is a very [[great]] advantage. when
judges are very numerous, [[death]] is perpetually thinning the ranks of
the judicial functionaries, and laying places vacant for newcomers. the
ambition of the magistrates is therefore continually excited, and they
are naturally made dependent upon the will of the majority, or the
individual who fills up the vacant appointments; the officers of the
court then rise like the officers of an [[army]]. this [[state]] of things is
entirely contrary to the sound administration of [[justice]], and to the
intentions of the legislator. the office of a [[judge]] is made inalienable
in order that he may remain independent: but of what advantage is it
that his independence should be protected if he be tempted to sacrifice
it of his own accord? when judges [[judge]] are very numerous many of them must
necessarily be incapable of performing their important duties [[duty]], for a
great magistrate is a [[man]] of no [[common]] powers [[power]]; and i am inclined to
believe that a half-enlightened tribunal is the worst of all instruments
for attaining those objects which it is the [[purpose]] of courts of justice
to accomplish. for my own part, i had rather submit the decision of a
case to ignorant jurors directed by a skilful [[judge]] than to judges [[judge]] a
majority of whom are imperfectly acquainted with jurisprudence and with
the laws [[law]].]

i turn, however, from this part of the [[subject]]. to look upon the jury as
a mere judicial institution is to confine our attention to a very narrow
view of it; for however [[great]] its influence may be upon the decisions
of the [[law]] courts, that influence is very subordinate to the powerful
effects which it produces [[produce]] on the destinies of the [[community]] at large.
the jury is above all a [[political]] institution, and it must be regarded
in this [[light]] in order to be duly appreciated.

by the jury i mean a [[certain]] number of [[citizens]] chosen indiscriminately,
and invested with a temporary [[right]] of judging. [[trial]] by jury, as
applied to the repression of crime, appears to me to introduce an
eminently republican element into the [[government]] upon the following
grounds:--

the institution of the jury may be aristocratic or democratic, according
to the class of [[society]] from which the jurors are selected; but it
always preserves its republican [[character]], inasmuch as it places the
real direction of [[society]] in the hands of the governed, or of a portion
of the governed, instead of leaving it under the [[authority]] of the
government. [[force]] is never more than a transient element of [[success]]; and
after [[force]] comes the notion of [[right]]. a [[government]] which should only
be able to crush its enemies [[enemy]] upon a field of [[battle]] would very soon be
destroyed. the true sanction of [[political]] laws [[law]] is to be found in penal
legislation, and if that sanction be wanting the [[law]] will sooner or
later lose its cogency. he who punishes infractions of the [[law]] is
therefore the real master of [[society]]. now the institution of the jury
raises the [[people]] itself, or at least a class of [[citizens]], to the bench
of judicial [[authority]]. the institution of the jury consequently invests
the [[people]], or that class of [[citizens]], with the direction of [[society]]. *e

[footnote e: an important remark must, however, be made. [[trial]] by jury
does unquestionably invest the [[people]] with a general control over the
actions of [[citizens]], but it does not furnish means of exercising this
control in all cases, or with an absolute [[authority]]. when an absolute
monarch has the [[right]] of trying offences by his representatives, the
fate of the [[prisoner]] is, as it were, decided beforehand. but even if
the [[people]] were predisposed to convict, the composition and the
non-responsibility of the jury would still afford some chances [[chance]] favorable
to the protection of innocence.]

in [[england]] the jury is returned from the aristocratic portion of
the nation; *f the [[aristocracy]] makes the laws [[law]], applies the laws [[law]], and
punishes all infractions of the laws [[law]]; everything is established upon a
consistent footing, and [[england]] may with [[truth]] be said to constitute an
aristocratic [[republic]]. in the [[united]] states the same [[system]] is applied
to the whole [[people]]. every american citizen is qualified to be an
elector, a juror, and is eligible to office. *g the [[system]] of the jury,
as it is understood in [[america]], appears to me to be as direct and as
extreme a consequence of the sovereignty of the [[people]] as universal
suffrage. these [[institutions]] are two instruments of [[equal]] [[power]], which
contribute to the [[supremacy]] of the majority. all the sovereigns [[sovereign]] who have
chosen to govern by their own [[authority]], and to direct [[society]] instead
of obeying its directions, have destroyed or enfeebled the institution
of the jury. the monarchs of the house of tudor sent to prison jurors
who refused to convict, and napoleon caused them to be returned by his
agents.

[footnote f: [this may be true to some extent of special juries, but
not of [[common]] juries. the author seems not to have been aware that the
qualifications of jurors in [[england]] vary exceedingly.]]

[footnote g: see appendix, q.]

however clear most of these truths [[truth]] may seem to be, they do not command
universal assent, and in [[france]], at least, the institution of [[trial]] by
jury is still very imperfectly understood. if the [[question]] arises as to
the proper qualification of jurors, it is confined to a discussion of
the [[intelligence]] and [[knowledge]] of the [[citizens]] who may be returned, as
if the jury was merely a judicial institution. this appears to me to
be the least part of the [[subject]]. the jury is pre-eminently a political
institution; it must be regarded as one form of the sovereignty of the
people; when that sovereignty is repudiated, it must be rejected, or it
must be adapted to the laws [[law]] by which that sovereignty is established.
the jury is that portion of the nation to which the execution of the
laws is entrusted, as the houses of [[parliament]] constitute that part
of the nation which makes the laws [[law]]; and in order that [[society]] may be
governed with consistency and uniformity, the list of [[citizens]] qualified
to serve on juries must increase and diminish with the list of electors.
this i hold to be the point of view most worthy of the attention of the
legislator, and all that remains is merely accessory.

i am so entirely convinced that the jury is pre-eminently a political
institution that i still consider it in this [[light]] when it is applied in
civil causes. laws [[law]] are always unstable unless they are founded upon the
manners of a nation; manners are the only durable and resisting power
in a [[people]]. when the jury is reserved for [[criminal]] offences, the people
only witnesses its occasional action in [[certain]] particular cases; the
ordinary course of [[life]] goes on without its interference, and it
is considered as an instrument, but not as the only instrument, of
obtaining [[justice]]. this is true a fortiori when the jury is only applied
to [[certain]] [[criminal]] causes.

when, on the contrary, the influence of the jury is extended to civil
causes, its application is constantly palpable; it affects all the
interests of the [[community]]; everyone co-operates in its [[work]]: it thus
penetrates into all the usages of [[life]], it fashions the [[human]] [[mind]] to
its peculiar forms, and is gradually associated with the [[idea]] of justice
itself.

the institution of the jury, if confined to [[criminal]] causes, is always
in danger, but when once it is introduced into civil proceedings it
defies the aggressions of [[time]] and of [[man]]. if it had been as easy to
remove the jury from the manners as from the laws [[law]] of [[england]], it would
have perished under henry viii, and elizabeth, and the civil jury did in
reality, at that period, save the liberties [[liberty]] of the [[country]]. in whatever
manner the jury be applied, it cannot fail to exercise a powerful
influence upon the national [[character]]; but this influence is
prodigiously increased when it is introduced into civil causes. the
jury, and more especially the jury in civil cases, serves to communicate
the spirit of the judges [[judge]] to the minds [[mind]] of all the [[citizens]]; and this
spirit, with the habits which attend it, is the soundest preparation for
free [[institutions]]. it imbues all classes with a [[respect]] for the thing
judged, and with the notion of [[right]]. if these two elements be removed,
the [[love]] of independence is reduced to a mere destructive passion. it
teaches [[men]] to practice equity, every [[man]] learns to [[judge]] his neighbor
as he would himself be judged; and this is especially true of the jury
in civil causes, for, whilst the number of persons [[person]] who have [[reason]] to
apprehend a [[criminal]] prosecution is small, every one is liable to have
a civil action brought against him. the jury teaches [[teach]] every [[man]] not to
recoil before the responsibility of his own actions, and impresses him
with that manly confidence without which [[political]] [[virtue]] cannot [[exist]].
it invests each citizen with a [[kind]] of magistracy, it makes them all
feel the duties [[duty]] which they are bound to discharge towards [[society]], and
the part which they take in the [[government]]. by obliging [[men]] to turn
their attention to affairs which are not exclusively their own, it rubs
off that [[individual]] egotism which is the rust of [[society]].

the jury contributes most powerfully to form the judgement and to
increase the [[natural]] [[intelligence]] of a [[people]], and this is, in my
opinion, its [[greatest]] advantage. it may be regarded as a gratuitous
public school ever open, in which every juror learns to exercise his
rights, enters into daily communication with the most learned and
enlightened members of the upper classes, and becomes practically
acquainted with the laws [[law]] of his [[country]], which are brought within the
reach of his capacity by the efforts of the bar, the [[advice]] of the
judge, and even by the [[passions]] of the parties. i [[think]] that the
practical [[intelligence]] and [[political]] [[good]] sense of the americans are
mainly attributable to the long use which they have made of the jury in
civil causes. i do not [[know]] whether the jury is useful to those who are
in litigation; but i am [[certain]] it is highly beneficial to those who
decide the litigation; and i look upon it as one of the most efficacious
means for the [[education]] of the [[people]] which [[society]] can employ.

what i have hitherto said applies to all nations, but the remark i
am now about to make is peculiar to the americans and to democratic
peoples. i have already observed that in democracies [[democracy]] the members of the
legal profession and the magistrates constitute the only aristocratic
body which can check the irregularities of the [[people]]. this aristocracy
is invested with no physical [[power]], but it exercises its conservative
influence upon the minds [[mind]] of [[men]], and the most abundant source of its
authority is the institution of the civil jury. in [[criminal]] causes, when
society is armed against a [[single]] [[individual]], the jury is apt to
look upon the [[judge]] as the passive instrument of social [[power]], and to
mistrust his [[advice]]. moreover, [[criminal]] causes are entirely founded upon
the evidence of facts [[fact]] which [[common]] sense can readily appreciate; upon
this ground the [[judge]] and the jury are [[equal]]. such, however, is not the
case in civil causes; then the [[judge]] appears as a disinterested arbiter
between the conflicting [[passions]] of the parties. the jurors look up to
him with confidence and listen to him with [[respect]], for in this instance
their [[intelligence]] is completely under the control of his learning. it
is the [[judge]] who sums up the various arguments with which their memory
has been wearied out, and who guides them through the devious course of
the proceedings; he points their attention to the exact [[question]] of
fact which they are called upon to solve, and he puts the [[answer]] to the
question of [[law]] into their mouths. his influence upon their verdict is
almost unlimited.

if i am called upon to explain why i am but little moved by the
arguments derived from the ignorance of jurors in civil causes, i reply,
that in these proceedings, whenever the [[question]] to be solved is not
a mere [[question]] of [[fact]], the jury has only the semblance of a judicial
body. the jury sanctions the decision of the [[judge]], they by the
authority of [[society]] which they represent, and he by that of [[reason]] and
of [[law]]. *h

[footnote h: see appendix, r.]

in [[england]] and in [[america]] the judges [[judge]] exercise an influence upon criminal
trials which the french judges [[judge]] have never possessed. the [[reason]] of
this difference may easily be discovered; the english and american
magistrates establish their [[authority]] in civil causes, and only transfer
it afterwards to tribunals of another [[kind]], where that [[authority]] was
not acquired. in some cases (and they are frequently the most important
ones) the american judges [[judge]] have the [[right]] of deciding causes alone. *i
upon these occasions [[occasion]] they are accidentally placed in the position which
the french judges [[judge]] habitually occupy, but they are invested with far more
power than the latter; they are still surrounded by the reminiscence of
the jury, and their [[judgment]] has almost as much [[authority]] as the voice
of the [[community]] at large, represented by that institution. their
influence extends beyond the limits of the courts; in the recreations of
private [[life]] as well as in the turmoil of [[public]] [[business]], abroad and in
the legislative assemblies, the american [[judge]] is constantly surrounded
by [[men]] who are accustomed to regard his [[intelligence]] as superior to
their own, and after having exercised his [[power]] in the decision
of causes, he continues to influence the habits of [[thought]] and the
characters of the individuals [[individual]] who took a part in his [[judgment]].


[footnote i: the federal judges [[judge]] decide upon their own [[authority]] almost
all the questions [[question]] most important to the [[country]].]

the jury, then, which seems to restrict the rights [[right]] of magistracy, does
in reality consolidate its [[power]], and in no [[country]] are the judges [[judge]] so
powerful as there, where the [[people]] partakes their privileges [[privilege]]. it is
more especially by means of the jury in civil causes that the american
magistrates imbue all classes of [[society]] with the spirit of their
profession. thus the jury, which is the most energetic means of making
the [[people]] [[rule]], is also the most efficacious means of teaching it to
rule well.




chapter xvii: principal causes maintaining the democratic republic--part i

principal causes which tend to maintain the democratic [[republic]] in the
united states

a democratic [[republic]] subsists in the [[united]] states, and the principal
object of this [[book]] has been to account for the [[fact]] of its existence.
several of the causes which contribute to maintain the [[institutions]] of
america have been involuntarily passed by or only hinted at as i was
borne along by my [[subject]]. others i have been unable to discuss, and
those on which i have dwelt most are, as it were, buried in the details
of the former parts of this [[work]]. i [[think]], therefore, that before i
proceed to speak of the future, i cannot do [[better]] than collect within
a small compass the reasons [[reason]] which [[best]] explain the [[present]]. in this
retrospective [[chapter]] i shall be succinct, for i shall take [[care]] to
remind the reader very summarily of what he already knows [[know]]; and i shall
only select the most prominent of those facts [[fact]] which i have not yet
pointed out.

all the causes which contribute to the maintenance of the democratic
republic in the [[united]] states are reducible to three heads:--

i. the peculiar and accidental situation in which providence has placed
the americans.

ii. the laws [[law]].

iii. the manners and customs of the [[people]].

accidental or providential causes which contribute to the maintenance
of the democratic [[republic]] in the [[united]] states the union has no
neighbors--no metropolis--the americans have had the chances [[chance]] of birth in
their favor--america an empty country--how this circumstance contributes
powerfully to the maintenance of the democratic [[republic]] in america--how
the american wilds are peopled--avidity of the anglo-americans in taking
possession of the solitudes of the new world--influence of physical
prosperity upon the [[political]] opinions [[opinion]] of the americans.

a thousand circumstances, independent of the will of [[man]], concur to
facilitate the maintenance of a democratic [[republic]] in the united
states. some of these peculiarities are known, the others may easily be
pointed out; but i shall confine myself to the most prominent amongst
them.

the americans have no neighbors, and consequently they have no great
wars, or financial crises, or inroads, or [[conquest]] to dread; they
require neither [[great]] taxes, nor [[great]] armies [[army]], nor [[great]] generals; and
they have nothing to [[fear]] from a scourge which is more formidable to
republics than all these evils [[evil]] combined, namely, [[military]] [[glory]]. it
is impossible to deny the inconceivable influence which military
glory exercises upon the spirit of a nation. general jackson, whom the
americans have twice elected to the head of their [[government]], is a man
of a [[violent]] temper and mediocre [[talents]]; no one circumstance in the
whole course of his [[career]] ever proved that he is qualified to govern a
free [[people]], and indeed the majority of the enlightened classes of
the union has always been opposed to him. but he was raised to the
presidency, and has been maintained in that lofty station, solely by
the recollection of a [[victory]] which he gained twenty years ago under
the walls of new orleans, a [[victory]] which was, however, a very ordinary
achievement, and which could only be remembered in a [[country]] where
battles are rare. now the [[people]] which is thus carried away by the
illusions of [[glory]] is unquestionably the most cold and calculating, the
most unmilitary (if i may use the expression), and the most prosaic of
all the peoples [[people]] of the [[earth]].

america has no [[great]] [[capital]] *a [[city]], whose influence is directly or
indirectly [[felt]] over the whole extent of the [[country]], which i hold to be
one of the first causes of the maintenance of republican institutions
in the [[united]] states. in cities [[city]] [[men]] cannot be prevented from concerting
together, and from awakening a mutual excitement which prompts
sudden and passionate resolutions. cities [[city]] may be looked upon as large
assemblies, of which all the inhabitants are members; their populace
exercises a prodigious influence upon the magistrates, and frequently
executes its own wishes [[wish]] without their intervention.

[footnote a: the [[united]] states have no metropolis, but they already
contain several very large cities [[city]]. philadelphia reckoned 161,000
inhabitants and new york 202,000 in the year 1830. the lower orders
which inhabit these cities [[city]] constitute a rabble even more formidable
than the populace of [[european]] towns. they consist of freed blacks in the
first place, who are condemned by the laws [[law]] and by [[public]] [[opinion]] to
a hereditary [[state]] of misery and degradation. they also contain a
multitude of europeans [[european]] who have been driven to the shores of the new
world by their misfortunes or their misconduct; and these [[men]] inoculate
the [[united]] states with all our vices [[vice]], without bringing with them any of
those interests which counteract their baneful influence. as inhabitants
of a [[country]] where they have no civil rights [[right]], they are ready to turn all
the [[passions]] which agitate the [[community]] to their own advantage; thus,
within the [[last]] few months serious riots have broken out in philadelphia
and in new york. disturbances of this [[kind]] are unknown in the rest of
the [[country]], which is nowise alarmed by them, because the [[population]] of
the cities [[city]] has hitherto exercised neither [[power]] nor influence over the
rural districts. nevertheless, i look upon the size of [[certain]] american
cities, and especially on the [[nature]] of their [[population]], as a real
danger which threatens the future security of the democratic republics
of the new [[world]]; and i venture to predict that they will perish from
this circumstance unless the [[government]] succeeds in creating an armed
force, which, whilst it remains under the control of the majority of the
nation, will be independent of the town [[population]], and able to repress
its excesses.

[the [[population]] of the [[city]] of new york had risen, in 1870, to 942,292,
and that of philadelphia to 674,022. brooklyn, which may be said to form
part of new york [[city]], has a [[population]] of 396,099, in addition to that
of new york. the frequent disturbances in the [[great]] cities [[city]] of [[america]],
and the excessive [[corruption]] of their local governments--over which
there is no effectual control--are amongst the [[greatest]] evils [[evil]] and
dangers of the [[country]].]]

to [[subject]] the provinces to the metropolis is therefore not only
to place the [[destiny]] of the [[empire]] in the hands of a portion of the
community, which may be reprobated as [[unjust]], but to place it in the
hands of a populace acting under its own impulses, which must be avoided
as dangerous. the preponderance of [[capital]] cities [[city]] is therefore a serious
blow upon the representative [[system]], and it exposes [[modern]] republics [[republic]] to
the same defect as the republics [[republic]] of antiquity, which all perished from
not having been acquainted with that form of [[government]].

it would be easy for me to adduce a [[great]] number of secondary causes
which have contributed to establish, and which concur to maintain, the
democratic [[republic]] of the [[united]] states. but i discern two principal
circumstances amongst these favorable elements, which i hasten to point
out. i have already observed that the origin of the american settlements
may be looked upon as the first and most efficacious cause to which the
present [[prosperity]] of the [[united]] states may be attributed. the americans
had the chances [[chance]] of birth in their favor, and their forefathers imported
that equality of conditions into the [[country]] whence the democratic
republic has very naturally taken its rise. nor was this all they did;
for besides this republican condition of [[society]], the early settler
bequeathed to their descendants those customs, manners, and opinions
which contribute most to the [[success]] of a republican form of [[government]].
when i reflect upon the consequences of this primary circumstance,
methinks i see the [[destiny]] of [[america]] embodied in the first puritan who
landed on those shores, just as the [[human]] [[race]] was represented by the
first [[man]].

the [[chief]] circumstance which has favored the establishment and the
maintenance of a democratic [[republic]] in the [[united]] states is the nature
of the territory which the american inhabit. their [[ancestors]] gave them
the [[love]] of equality and of [[freedom]], but [[god]] himself gave them the means
of remaining [[equal]] and [[free]], by placing them upon a boundless continent,
which is open to their exertions. general [[prosperity]] is favorable to
the stability of all governments [[government]], but more particularly of a democratic
constitution, which depends upon the dispositions of the majority, and
more particularly of that portion of the [[community]] which is most exposed
to [[feel]] the pressure of want. when the [[people]] rules [[rule]], it must be rendered
happy, or it will overturn the [[state]], and misery is apt to stimulate it
to those excesses to which [[ambition]] rouses kings [[king]]. the physical causes,
independent of the laws [[law]], which contribute to promote general [[prosperity]],
are more numerous in [[america]] than they have ever been in any other
country in the [[world]], at any other period of [[history]]. in the united
states not only is legislation democratic, but [[nature]] herself favors the
cause of the [[people]].

in what part of [[human]] tradition can be found anything at all similar to
that which is occurring under our [[eyes]] in north [[america]]? the celebrated
communities of antiquity were all founded in the midst of hostile
nations, which they were obliged to subjugate before they could flourish
in their place. even the moderns have found, in some parts of south
america, vast regions inhabited by a [[people]] of inferior [[civilization]],
but which occupied and cultivated the soil. to found their new states
it was necessary to extirpate or to subdue a numerous [[population]], until
civilization has been made to blush for their [[success]]. but north america
was only inhabited by wandering tribes, who took no [[thought]] of the
natural riches [[rich]] of the soil, and that vast [[country]] was still, properly
speaking, an empty continent, a desert [[land]] awaiting its inhabitants.

everything is extraordinary in [[america]], the social condition of
the inhabitants, as well as the laws [[law]]; but the soil upon which these
institutions are founded is more extraordinary than all the rest.
when [[man]] was first placed upon the [[earth]] by the creator, the [[earth]] was
inexhaustible in its [[youth]], but [[man]] was [[weak]] and ignorant; and when he
had learned to explore the treasures which it contained, hosts of his
fellow creatures covered its surface, and he was obliged to earn an
asylum for repose and for [[freedom]] by the [[sword]]. at that same period
north [[america]] was discovered, as if it had been kept in reserve by the
deity, and had just risen from beneath the waters of the deluge.

that continent still presents [[present]], as it did in the primeval [[time]], rivers
which rise from never-failing sources, green and moist solitudes, and
fields which the ploughshare of the husbandman has never turned. in this
state it is offered to [[man]], not in the barbarous and isolated condition
of the early ages [[age]], but to a being who is already in possession of
the most potent secrets of the [[natural]] [[world]], who is [[united]] to his
fellow-men, and instructed by the [[experience]] of fifty centuries. at
this very [[time]] thirteen millions of civilized europeans [[european]] are peaceably
spreading over those fertile plains, with whose resources and whose
extent they are not yet themselves accurately acquainted. three or four
thousand soldiers drive the wandering races [[race]] of the aborigines before
them; these are followed by the pioneers, who pierce the woods, scare
off the beasts of prey, explore the courses of the inland streams, and
make ready the triumphal procession of [[civilization]] across the waste.

the favorable influence of the temporal [[prosperity]] of [[america]] upon the
institutions of that [[country]] has been so often described by others,
and adverted to by myself, that i shall not enlarge upon it beyond the
addition of a few facts [[fact]]. an erroneous notion is generally entertained
that the deserts of [[america]] are peopled by [[european]] emigrants, who
annually disembark upon the coasts of the new [[world]], whilst the american
population increases and multiplies upon the soil which its forefathers
tilled. the [[european]] settler, however, usually arrives in the united
states without [[friends]], and sometimes without resources; in order to
subsist he is obliged to [[work]] for hire, and he rarely proceeds beyond
that belt of industrious [[population]] which adjoins the ocean. the desert
cannot be explored without [[capital]] or credit; and the [[body]] must be
accustomed to the rigors of a new [[climate]] before it can be exposed to
the chances [[chance]] of forest [[life]]. it is the americans themselves who daily
quit the spots which gave them birth to acquire extensive domains in
a remote [[country]]. thus the [[european]] leaves his cottage for the
trans-atlantic shores; and the american, who is born on that very coast,
plunges in his turn into the wilds of central [[america]]. this double
emigration is incessant; it begins in the remotest parts of [[europe]], it
crosses the atlantic ocean, and it advances over the solitudes of
the new [[world]]. millions of [[men]] are marching at once towards the same
horizon; their [[language]], their [[religion]], their manners differ, their
object is the same. the gifts of [[fortune]] are promised in the west, and
to the west they bend their course. *b

[footnote b: [the number of [[foreign]] immigrants into the [[united]] states in
the [[last]] fifty years (from 1820 to 1871) is stated to be 7,556,007. of
these, 4,104,553 spoke english--that is, they came from [[great]] [[britain]],
ireland, or the british colonies; 2,643,069 came from germany or
northern [[europe]]; and about half a million from the south of [[europe]].]]

no event can be compared with this continuous removal of the [[human]] [[race]],
except perhaps those irruptions which preceded the fall of the roman
empire. then, as well as now, generations [[generation]] of [[men]] were impelled forwards
in the same direction to meet and struggle on the same spot; but the
designs of providence were not the same; then, every newcomer was the
harbinger of destruction and of [[death]]; now, every adventurer brings with
him the elements of [[prosperity]] and of [[life]]. the future still conceals
from us the ulterior consequences of this emigration of the americans
towards the west; but we can readily apprehend its more immediate
results. as a portion of the inhabitants annually leave the states in
which they were born, the [[population]] of these states increases very
slowly, although they have long been established: thus in connecticut,
which only contains fifty-nine inhabitants to the square mile, the
population has not increased by more than one-quarter in forty years,
whilst that of [[england]] has been augmented by one-third in the lapse of
the same period. the [[european]] emigrant always lands [[land]], therefore, in
a [[country]] which is but half full, and where hands are in request:
he becomes a workman in easy circumstances; his [[son]] goes to seek his
fortune in unpeopled regions, and he becomes a [[rich]] landowner. the
former amasses the [[capital]] which the latter invests, and the stranger as
well as the native is unacquainted with want.

the laws [[law]] of the [[united]] states are extremely favorable to the division
of [[property]]; but a cause which is more powerful than the laws [[law]] prevents
property from being divided to excess. *c this is very perceptible in
the states which are beginning to be thickly peopled; massachusetts
is the most populous part of the union, but it contains only eighty
inhabitants to the square mile, which is must less than in [[france]], where
162 are reckoned to the same extent of [[country]]. but in massachusetts
estates are very rarely divided; the eldest [[son]] takes the [[land]], and the
others go to seek their [[fortune]] in the desert. the [[law]] has abolished
the rights [[right]] of primogeniture, but circumstances have concurred to
re-establish it under a form of which none can [[complain]], and by which no
just rights [[right]] are impaired.

[footnote c: in new [[england]] the estates are exceedingly small, but they
are rarely subjected to further division.]

a [[single]] [[fact]] will suffice to show the prodigious number of individuals
who leave new [[england]], in this manner, to settle themselves in the
wilds. we were assured in 1830 that thirty-six of the members of
congress were born in the little [[state]] of connecticut. the [[population]] of
connecticut, which constitutes only one forty-third part of that of
the [[united]] states, thus furnished one-eighth of the whole [[body]] of
representatives. the states of connecticut, however, only sends five
delegates to congress; and the thirty-one others sit for the new western
states. if these thirty-one individuals [[individual]] had remained in connecticut,
it is probable that instead of becoming [[rich]] landowners they would
have remained humble laborers, that they would have lived in obscurity
without being able to rise into [[public]] [[life]], and that, far from becoming
useful members of the legislature, they might have been unruly [[citizens]].

these reflections do not escape the observation of the americans any
more than of ourselves. "it cannot be doubted," says chancellor kent
in his "treatise on american [[law]]," "that the division of landed estates
must [[produce]] [[great]] evils [[evil]] when it is carried to such excess as that
each parcel of [[land]] is insufficient to support a [[family]]; but these
disadvantages have never been [[felt]] in the [[united]] states, and many
generations must elapse before they can be [[felt]]. the extent of our
inhabited territory, the abundance of adjacent [[land]], and the continual
stream of emigration flowing from the shores of the atlantic towards
the interior of the [[country]], suffice as yet, and will long suffice, to
prevent the parcelling out of estates."

it is difficult to describe the rapacity with which the american rushes
forward to secure the immense booty which [[fortune]] proffers to him.
in the pursuit he fearlessly braves the arrow of the [[indian]] and the
distempers of the forest; he is unimpressed by the [[silence]] of the woods;
the approach of beasts of prey does not disturb him; for he is goaded
onwards by a passion more intense than the [[love]] of [[life]]. before him lies
a boundless continent, and he urges onwards as if [[time]] pressed, and he
was afraid of finding no room for his exertions. i have spoken of the
emigration from the older states, but how shall i describe that which
takes place from the more recent ones? fifty years have scarcely elapsed
since that of ohio was founded; the greater part of its inhabitants were
not born within its confines; its [[capital]] has only been built thirty
years, and its territory is still covered by an immense extent of
uncultivated fields; nevertheless the [[population]] of ohio is already
proceeding westward, and most of the settlers who descend to the fertile
savannahs of illinois are [[citizens]] of ohio. these [[men]] left their first
country to improve their condition; they quit their resting-place to
ameliorate it still more; [[fortune]] awaits them everywhere, but happiness
they cannot attain. the [[desire]] of [[prosperity]] is become an ardent and
restless passion in their minds [[mind]] which grows by what it gains. they early
broke the ties which bound them to their natal [[earth]], and they have
contracted no fresh ones on their way. emigration was at first necessary
to them as a means of subsistence; and it soon becomes a sort of game of
chance, which they pursue for the emotions it excites as much as for the
gain it procures.

sometimes the [[progress]] of [[man]] is so rapid that the desert reappears
behind him. the woods stoop to give him a passage, and spring up again
when he has passed. it is not uncommon in crossing the new states of
the west to meet with deserted dwellings in the midst of the wilds; the
traveller frequently discovers the vestiges of a log house in the most
solitary retreats, which bear witness to the [[power]], and no less to the
inconstancy of [[man]]. in these abandoned fields, and over these ruins of
a day, the primeval forest soon scatters a fresh vegetation, the beasts
resume the haunts which were once their own, and [[nature]] covers the
traces of man's [[man]] path with branches and with flowers, which obliterate
his evanescent track.

i [[remember]] that, in crossing one of the woodland districts which still
cover the [[state]] of new york, i reached the shores of a lake embosomed in
forests coeval with the [[world]]. a small island, covered with woods whose
thick foliage concealed its banks, rose from the centre of the waters.
upon the shores of the lake no object attested the presence of man
except a column of smoke which might be seen on the horizon rising from
the tops of the trees to the clouds, and seeming to hang from heaven
rather than to be mounting to the [[sky]]. an [[indian]] shallop was hauled
up on the sand, which tempted me to visit the islet that had first
attracted my attention, and in a few minutes i set foot upon its banks.
the whole island formed one of those delicious solitudes of the new
world which almost lead civilized [[man]] to regret the haunts of the
savage. a luxuriant vegetation bore witness to the incomparable
fruitfulness of the soil. the deep [[silence]] which is [[common]] to the
wilds of north [[america]] was only broken by the hoarse cooing of the
wood-pigeon, and the tapping of the woodpecker upon the bark of trees.
i was far from supposing that this spot had ever been inhabited, so
completely did [[nature]] seem to be left to her own caprices; but when i
reached the centre of the isle i [[thought]] that i discovered some traces
of [[man]]. i then proceeded to examine the surrounding objects with [[care]],
and i soon perceived that a [[european]] had undoubtedly been [[led]] to seek a
refuge in this retreat. yet what changes [[change]] had taken place in the scene of
his labors! the logs which he had hastily hewn to build himself a
shed had sprouted afresh; the very props were intertwined with living
verdure, and his cabin was transformed into a bower. in the midst of
these shrubs a few stones were to be seen, blackened with [[fire]] and
sprinkled with thin ashes; here the hearth had no [[doubt]] been, and the
chimney in falling had covered it with rubbish. i stood for some [[time]] in
silent admiration of the exuberance of [[nature]] and the littleness of [[man]]:
and when i was obliged to leave that enchanting solitude, i exclaimed
with melancholy, "are ruins, then, already here?"

in [[europe]] we are wont to look upon a restless disposition, an unbounded
desire of riches [[rich]], and an excessive [[love]] of independence, as propensities
very formidable to [[society]]. yet these are the very elements which ensure
a long and peaceful duration to the republics [[republic]] of [[america]]. without these
unquiet [[passions]] the [[population]] would collect in [[certain]] spots, and
would soon be [[subject]] to wants like those of the old [[world]], which it is
difficult to satisfy; for such is the [[present]] [[good]] [[fortune]] of the new
world, that the vices [[vice]] of its inhabitants are scarcely less favorable
to [[society]] than their virtues [[virtue]]. these circumstances exercise a great
influence on the estimation in which [[human]] actions are held in the two
hemispheres. the americans frequently term what we should call cupidity
a laudable industry; and they blame as faint-heartedness what we
consider to be the [[virtue]] of moderate desires [[desire]].

in [[france]], simple tastes, orderly manners, domestic affections, and the
attachments which [[men]] [[feel]] to the place of their birth, are looked upon
as [[great]] guarantees of the tranquillity and [[happiness]] of the [[state]]. but
in [[america]] nothing seems to be more prejudicial to [[society]] than these
virtues. the french canadians, who have faithfully preserved the
traditions of their pristine manners, are already embarrassed for room
upon their small territory; and this little [[community]], which has so
recently begun to [[exist]], will shortly be a prey to the calamities
incident to old nations. in canada, the most enlightened, patriotic,
and humane inhabitants make extraordinary efforts to render the people
dissatisfied with those simple enjoyments which still content it. there,
the seductions of [[wealth]] are vaunted with as much zeal as the charms of
an honest but limited income in the old [[world]], and more exertions are
made to excite the [[passions]] of the [[citizens]] there than to calm them
elsewhere. if we listen to their eulogies, we shall hear that nothing is
more praiseworthy than to exchange the pure and homely pleasures [[pleasure]] which
even the [[poor]] [[man]] tastes in his own [[country]] for the dull delights of
prosperity under a [[foreign]] [[sky]]; to leave the patrimonial hearth and
the turf beneath which his forefathers sleep; in short, to abandon the
living and the [[dead]] in quest of [[fortune]].

at the [[present]] [[time]] [[america]] presents [[present]] a field for [[human]] effort far more
extensive than any sum of labor which can be applied to [[work]] it. in
america too much [[knowledge]] cannot be diffused; for all [[knowledge]], whilst
it may serve him who possesses it, turns also to the advantage of those
who are without it. new wants are not to be feared, since they can be
satisfied without difficulty; the [[growth]] of [[human]] [[passions]] need not be
dreaded, since all [[passions]] may find an easy and a legitimate object;
nor can [[men]] be put in possession of too much [[freedom]], since they are
scarcely ever tempted to misuse their liberties [[liberty]].

the american republics [[republic]] of the [[present]] day are like companies of
adventurers formed to explore in [[common]] the waste lands [[land]] of the new
world, and busied in a flourishing [[trade]]. the [[passions]] which agitate
the americans most deeply are not their [[political]] but their commercial
passions; or, to speak more correctly, they introduce the habits they
contract in [[business]] into their [[political]] [[life]]. they [[love]] order, without
which affairs do not [[prosper]]; and they set an especial value upon a
regular conduct, which is the foundation of a solid [[business]]; they
prefer the [[good]] sense which amasses large fortunes [[fortune]] to that enterprising
spirit which frequently dissipates them; general ideas [[idea]] alarm their
minds, which are accustomed to positive calculations, and they hold
practice in more [[honor]] than theory.

it is in [[america]] that one learns to [[understand]] the influence which
physical [[prosperity]] exercises over [[political]] actions, and even over
opinions which ought to acknowledge no sway but that of [[reason]]; and it
is more especially amongst strangers that this [[truth]] is perceptible.
most of the [[european]] emigrants to the new [[world]] carry with them that
wild [[love]] of independence and of [[change]] which our calamities are so apt
to engender. i sometimes met with europeans [[european]] in the [[united]] states who had
been obliged to leave their own [[country]] on account of their political
opinions. they all astonished me by the [[language]] they held, but one of
them surprised me more than all the rest. as i was crossing one of the
most remote districts of pennsylvania i was benighted, and obliged
to beg for hospitality at the gate of a wealthy planter, who was a
frenchman by birth. he bade me sit down beside his [[fire]], and we began to
talk with that [[freedom]] which befits persons [[person]] who meet in the backwoods,
two thousand leagues from their native [[country]]. i was aware that my host
had been a [[great]] leveller and an ardent demagogue forty years ago, and
that his name was not unknown to fame. i was, therefore, not a little
surprised to hear him discuss the rights [[right]] of [[property]] as an economist or
a landowner might have done: he spoke of the necessary gradations which
fortune establishes among [[men]], of [[obedience]] to established laws [[law]], of
the influence of [[good]] morals [[moral]] in commonwealths, and of the support which
religious opinions [[opinion]] give to order and to [[freedom]]; he even went to far
as to quote an evangelical [[authority]] in corroboration of one of his
political tenets.

i listened, and marvelled at the feebleness of [[human]] [[reason]]. a
proposition is true or false, but no art [[arts]] can prove it to be one or the
other, in the midst of the uncertainties of [[science]] and the conflicting
lessons of [[experience]], until a new incident disperses the clouds of
doubt; i was [[poor]], i become [[rich]], and i am not to expect that prosperity
will act upon my conduct, and leave my [[judgment]] [[free]]; my opinions
change with my [[fortune]], and the [[happy]] circumstances which i turn to
my advantage furnish me with that decisive argument which was before
wanting. the influence of [[prosperity]] acts still more freely upon
the american than upon strangers. the american has always seen the
connection of [[public]] order and [[public]] [[prosperity]], intimately united
as they are, go on before his [[eyes]]; he does not conceive that one can
subsist without the other; he has therefore nothing to forget; nor
has he, like so many europeans [[european]], to unlearn the lessons of his early
education.




chapter xvii: principal causes maintaining the democratic republic--part ii

influence of the laws [[law]] upon the maintenance of the democratic [[republic]] in
the [[united]] states

three principal causes of the maintenance of the democratic
republic--federal constitutions--municipal institutions--judicial [[power]].

the principal aim of this [[book]] has been to make known the laws [[law]] of the
united states; if this [[purpose]] has been accomplished, the reader is
already enabled to [[judge]] for himself which are the laws [[law]] that really tend
to maintain the democratic [[republic]], and which endanger its existence.
if i have not succeeded in explaining this in the whole course of my
work, i cannot [[hope]] to do so within the limits of a [[single]] [[chapter]]. it
is not my intention to retrace the path i have already pursued, and
a very few lines will suffice to recapitulate what i have previously
explained.


three circumstances seem to me to contribute most powerfully to the
maintenance of the democratic [[republic]] in the [[united]] states.

the first is that federal form of [[government]] which the americans have
adopted, and which enables the union to combine the [[power]] of a great
empire with the security of a small [[state]].

the second consists in those municipal [[institutions]] which limit the
despotism of the majority, and at the same [[time]] impart a taste for
freedom and a [[knowledge]] of the art [[arts]] of being [[free]] to the [[people]].

the third is to be met with in the [[constitution]] of the judicial [[power]].
i have shown in what manner the courts of [[justice]] serve to repress the
excesses of [[democracy]], and how they check and direct the impulses of the
majority without stopping its activity.


influence of manners upon the maintenance of the democratic [[republic]] in
the [[united]] states


i have previously remarked that the manners of the [[people]] may be
considered as one of the general causes to which the maintenance of a
democratic [[republic]] in the [[united]] states is attributable. i here used
the word manners with the meaning which the ancients attached to the
word mores, for i apply it not only to manners in their proper sense of
what constitutes the [[character]] of social intercourse, but i extend it to
the various notions and opinions [[opinion]] current among [[men]], and to the mass
of those ideas [[idea]] which constitute their [[character]] of [[mind]]. i comprise,
therefore, under this term the whole [[moral]] and intellectual condition of
a [[people]]. my intention is not to draw a picture of american manners,
but simply to point out such features of them as are favorable to the
maintenance of [[political]] [[institutions]].

religion considered as a [[political]] institution, which powerfully
contributes to the maintenance of the democratic [[republic]] amongst the
americans

north [[america]] peopled by [[men]] who professed a democratic and republican
christianity--arrival of the catholics--for what [[reason]] the catholics
form the most democratic and the most republican class at the present
time.

every [[religion]] is to be found in juxtaposition to a [[political]] opinion
which is connected with it by affinity. if the [[human]] [[mind]] be left
to [[follow]] its own bent, it will regulate the temporal and spiritual
institutions of [[society]] upon one uniform [[principle]]; and [[man]] will
endeavor, if i may use the expression, to harmonize the [[state]] in which
he lives [[life]] upon [[earth]] with the [[state]] which he believes [[belief]] to await him in
heaven. the [[greatest]] part of british [[america]] was peopled by [[men]] who,
after having shaken off the [[authority]] of the [[pope]], acknowledged no other
religious [[supremacy]]; they brought with them into the new [[world]] a form
of [[christianity]] which i cannot [[better]] describe than by styling it a
democratic and republican [[religion]]. this sect contributed powerfully to
the establishment of a [[democracy]] and a [[republic]], and from the earliest
settlement of the emigrants [[politics]] and [[religion]] contracted an alliance
which has never been dissolved.

about fifty years ago ireland began to pour a catholic [[population]] into
the [[united]] states; on the other hand, the catholics of [[america]] made
proselytes, and at the [[present]] moment more than a million of christians
professing the truths [[truth]] of the [[church]] of [[rome]] are to be met with in
the union. *d the catholics are faithful to the observances of their
religion; they are fervent and zealous in the support and [[belief]] of
their doctrines. nevertheless they constitute the most republican and
the most democratic class of [[citizens]] which exists in the [[united]] states;
and although this [[fact]] may surprise the observer at first, the causes by
which it is occasioned may easily be discovered upon reflection.

[footnote d: [it is difficult to ascertain with accuracy the amount of
the roman catholic [[population]] of the [[united]] states, but in 1868 an able
writer in the "edinburgh review" (vol. cxxvii. p. 521) affirmed that the
whole catholic [[population]] of the [[united]] states was then about 4,000,000,
divided into 43 dioceses, with 3,795 churches [[church]], under the [[care]] of 45
bishops and 2,317 clergymen. but this rapid increase is mainly supported
by immigration from the catholic countries [[country]] of [[europe]].]]

i [[think]] that the catholic [[religion]] has erroneously been looked upon as
the [[natural]] [[enemy]] of [[democracy]]. amongst the various sects of christians [[christian]],
catholicism seems to me, on the contrary, to be one of those which are
most favorable to the equality of conditions. in the catholic [[church]],
the [[religious]] [[community]] is composed of only two elements, the [[priest]] and
the [[people]]. the [[priest]] alone rises above the rank of his flock, and all
below him are [[equal]].

on doctrinal points the catholic [[faith]] places all [[human]] capacities upon
the same level; it subjects [[subject]] the [[wise]] and ignorant, the [[man]] of genius and
the vulgar crowd, to the details of the same creed; it imposes the same
observances upon the [[rich]] and needy, it inflicts the same austerities
upon the [[strong]] and the [[weak]], it listens to no compromise with mortal
man, but, reducing all the [[human]] [[race]] to the same standard, it confounds
all the distinctions of [[society]] at the foot of the same altar, even as
they are confounded in the sight of [[god]]. if catholicism predisposes
the faithful to [[obedience]], it certainly does not prepare them for
inequality; but the contrary may be said of protestantism, which
generally tends to make [[men]] independent, more than to render them [[equal]].

catholicism is like an absolute [[monarchy]]; if the [[sovereign]] be removed,
all the other classes of [[society]] are more [[equal]] than they are in
republics. it has not unfrequently occurred that the catholic priest
has left the service of the altar to mix with the governing powers [[power]] of
society, and to take his place amongst the civil gradations of [[men]]. this
religious influence has sometimes been used to secure the interests
of that [[political]] [[state]] of things to which he belonged. at other times
catholics have taken the side of [[aristocracy]] from a spirit of [[religion]].

but no sooner is the priesthood entirely separated from the [[government]],
as is the case in the [[united]] states, than is found that no class of men
are more naturally disposed than the catholics to transfuse the doctrine
of the equality of conditions into the [[political]] [[world]]. if, then, the
catholic [[citizens]] of the [[united]] states are not forcibly [[led]] by the
nature of their tenets to adopt democratic and republican principles [[principle]],
at least they are not necessarily opposed to them; and their social
position, as well as their limited number, obliges them to adopt these
opinions. most of the catholics are [[poor]], and they have no [[chance]] of
taking a part in the [[government]] unless it be open to all the [[citizens]].
they constitute a minority, and all rights [[right]] must be respected in order
to insure to them the [[free]] exercise of their own privileges [[privilege]]. these two
causes induce them, unconsciously, to adopt [[political]] doctrines,
which they would perhaps support with less zeal if they were [[rich]] and
preponderant.

the catholic clergy of the [[united]] states has never attempted to oppose
this [[political]] tendency, but it seeks rather to justify its results. the
priests in [[america]] have divided the intellectual [[world]] into two parts:
in the one they place the doctrines of revealed [[religion]], which command
their assent; in the other they leave those truths [[truth]] which they [[believe]] to
have been freely left open to the researches of [[political]] inquiry.
thus the catholics of the [[united]] states are at the same [[time]] the most
faithful believers and the most zealous [[citizens]].

it may be asserted that in the [[united]] states no [[religious]] doctrine
displays the slightest hostility to democratic and republican
institutions. the clergy of all the different sects hold the same
language, their opinions [[opinion]] are consonant to the laws [[law]], and the human
intellect flows onwards in one sole current.

i happened to be staying in one of the largest towns in the union, when
i was invited to attend a [[public]] meeting which had been called for the
purpose of assisting the poles, and of sending them supplies of arms and
money. i found two or three thousand persons [[person]] collected in a vast hall
which had been prepared to receive them. in a short [[time]] a [[priest]] in
his ecclesiastical robes advanced to the front of the hustings: the
spectators rose, and stood uncovered, whilst he spoke in the following
terms:--

"almighty god! the [[god]] of armies! thou who didst strengthen the hearts
and guide the arms of our fathers [[father]] when they were fighting for the sacred
rights of national independence; thou who didst make them triumph over
a hateful oppression, and hast granted to our [[people]] the benefits
of [[liberty]] and [[peace]]; turn, o [[lord]], a favorable eye upon the other
hemisphere; pitifully look down upon that heroic nation which is even
now struggling as we did in the former [[time]], and for the same rights
which we defended with our [[blood]]. thou, who didst create [[man]] in the
likeness of the same image, let not [[tyranny]] mar thy [[work]], and establish
inequality upon the [[earth]]. almighty god! do thou watch over the destiny
of the poles, and render them worthy to be [[free]]. may thy [[wisdom]] direct
their councils, and may thy [[strength]] sustain their arms! shed forth thy
terror over their enemies [[enemy]], scatter the powers [[power]] which take counsel against
them; and vouchsafe that the [[injustice]] which the [[world]] has witnessed for
fifty years, be not consummated in our [[time]]. o [[lord]], who holdest alike
the hearts [[heart]] of nations and of [[men]] in thy powerful hand; raise up allies
to the [[sacred]] cause of [[right]]; arouse the french nation from the apathy
in which its rulers retain it, that it go forth again to [[fight]] for the
liberties of the [[world]].

"lord, turn not thou thy face from us, and grant that we may always be
the most [[religious]] as well as the freest [[people]] of the [[earth]]. almighty
god, hear our supplications this day. save the poles, we beseech thee,
in the name of thy well-beloved [[son]], our [[lord]] [[jesus]] [[christ]], who died
upon the cross for the salvation of [[men]]. amen."

the whole meeting responded "amen!" with devotion.


indirect influence of [[religious]] opinions [[opinion]] upon [[political]] [[society]] in the
united states


christian morality [[common]] to all sects--influence of [[religion]] upon the
manners of the americans--respect for the [[marriage]] tie--in what manner
religion confines the [[imagination]] of the americans within certain
limits, and checks the passion of innovation--opinion of the americans
on the [[political]] utility of religion--their exertions to extend and
secure its predominance.

i have just shown what the direct influence of [[religion]] upon politics
is in the [[united]] states, but its indirect influence appears to me to be
still more considerable, and it never instructs the americans more fully
in the art [[arts]] of being [[free]] than when it says nothing of [[freedom]].

the sects which [[exist]] in the [[united]] states are innumerable. they all
differ in [[respect]] to the [[worship]] which is due from [[man]] to his creator,
but they all agree in [[respect]] to the duties [[duty]] which are due from [[man]] to
man. each sect adores the deity in its own peculiar manner, but all
the sects preach the same [[moral]] [[law]] in the name of [[god]]. if it be of the
highest importance to [[man]], as an [[individual]], that his [[religion]] should be
true, the case of [[society]] is not the same. [[society]] has no future [[life]] to
hope for or to [[fear]]; and provided the [[citizens]] profess a [[religion]], the
peculiar tenets of that [[religion]] are of very little importance to its
interests. moreover, almost all the sects of the [[united]] states are
comprised within the [[great]] unity of [[christianity]], and [[christian]] morality
is everywhere the same.


it may be believed without unfairness that a [[certain]] number of americans
pursue a peculiar form of [[worship]], from habit more than from conviction.
in the [[united]] states the [[sovereign]] [[authority]] is [[religious]], and
consequently hypocrisy must be [[common]]; but there is no [[country]] in the
whole [[world]] in which the [[christian]] [[religion]] retains a greater influence
over the souls [[soul]] of [[men]] than in [[america]]; and there can be no greater proof
of its utility, and of its conformity to [[human]] [[nature]], than that its
influence is most powerfully [[felt]] over the most enlightened and free
nation of the [[earth]].

i have remarked that the members of the american clergy in general,
without even excepting those who do not admit [[religious]] [[liberty]], are
all in favor of civil [[freedom]]; but they do not support any particular
political [[system]]. they keep aloof from parties and from [[public]] affairs.
in the [[united]] states [[religion]] exercises but little influence upon the
laws and upon the details of [[public]] [[opinion]], but it directs the manners
of the [[community]], and by regulating domestic [[life]] it regulates the
state.

i do not [[question]] that the [[great]] austerity of manners which is
observable in the [[united]] states, arises, in the first instance, from
religious [[faith]]. [[religion]] is often unable to restrain [[man]] from the
numberless temptations of [[fortune]]; nor can it check that passion for
gain which every incident of his [[life]] contributes to arouse, but
its influence over the [[mind]] of woman is supreme, and [[women]] are the
protectors of morals [[moral]]. there is certainly no [[country]] in the world
where the tie of [[marriage]] is so much respected as in [[america]], or where
conjugal [[happiness]] is more highly or worthily appreciated. in europe
almost all the disturbances of [[society]] arise from the irregularities of
domestic [[life]]. to despise the [[natural]] bonds and legitimate pleasures [[pleasure]] of
home, is to contract a taste for excesses, a restlessness of [[heart]], and
the [[evil]] of fluctuating desires [[desire]]. agitated by the tumultuous passions
which frequently disturb his dwelling, the [[european]] is galled by the
obedience which the legislative powers [[power]] of the [[state]] exact. but when the
american retires from the turmoil of [[public]] [[life]] to the bosom of his
family, he finds in it the image of order and of [[peace]]. there his
pleasures are simple and [[natural]], his joys are [[innocent]] and calm; and
as he finds that an orderly [[life]] is the surest path to [[happiness]], he
accustoms himself without difficulty to moderate his opinions [[opinion]] as well
as his tastes. whilst the [[european]] endeavors to forget his domestic
troubles by agitating [[society]], the american derives from his own home
that [[love]] of order which he afterwards carries with him into public
affairs.

in the [[united]] states the influence of [[religion]] is not confined to the
manners, but it extends to the [[intelligence]] of the [[people]]. amongst
the anglo-americans, there are some who profess the doctrines of
christianity from a sincere [[belief]] in them, and others who do the same
because they are afraid to be suspected of unbelief. [[christianity]],
therefore, reigns without any obstacle, by universal [[consent]]; the
consequence is, as i have before observed, that every [[principle]] of the
moral [[world]] is fixed and determinate, although the [[political]] [[world]] is
abandoned to the debates and the experiments of [[men]]. thus the [[human]] mind
is never left to wander across a boundless field; and, whatever may be
its pretensions, it is checked from [[time]] to [[time]] by barriers which it
cannot surmount. before it can perpetrate innovation, [[certain]] primal and
immutable principles [[principle]] are laid down, and the boldest conceptions of
human device are subjected to [[certain]] forms which retard and stop their
completion.

the [[imagination]] of the americans, even in its [[greatest]] flights, is
circumspect and undecided; its impulses are checked, and its works
unfinished. these habits of restraint recur in [[political]] [[society]], and
are singularly favorable both to the tranquillity of the [[people]] and
to the durability of the [[institutions]] it has established. [[nature]] and
circumstances concurred to make the inhabitants of the [[united]] states
bold [[men]], as is sufficiently attested by the enterprising spirit with
which they seek for [[fortune]]. if the [[mind]] of the americans were [[free]] from
all trammels, they would very shortly become the most daring innovators
and the most implacable disputants in the [[world]]. but the revolutionists
of [[america]] are obliged to profess an ostensible [[respect]] for christian
morality and equity, which does not easily permit them to violate the
laws that oppose their designs; nor would they find it easy to surmount
the scruples of their partisans, even if they were able to get over
their own. hitherto no one in the [[united]] states has dared to advance the
maxim, that everything is permissible with a view to the interests of
society; an impious adage which seems to have been [[invented]] in an [[age]] of
freedom to shelter all the tyrants [[tyrant]] of future ages [[age]]. thus whilst the law
permits the americans to do what they please, [[religion]] prevents them
from conceiving, and forbids them to commit, what is rash or [[unjust]].

religion in [[america]] takes no direct part in the [[government]] of [[society]],
but it must nevertheless be regarded as the foremost of the political
institutions of that [[country]]; for if it does not impart a taste for
freedom, it facilitates the use of [[free]] [[institutions]]. indeed, it is
in this same point of view that the inhabitants of the [[united]] states
themselves look upon [[religious]] [[belief]]. i do not [[know]] whether all the
americans have a sincere [[faith]] in their [[religion]], for who can search the
human [[heart]]? but i am [[certain]] that they hold it to be indispensable to
the maintenance of republican [[institutions]]. this [[opinion]] is not peculiar
to a class of [[citizens]] or to a party, but it belongs to the whole
nation, and to every rank of [[society]].

in the [[united]] states, if a [[political]] [[character]] attacks a sect, this may
not prevent even the partisans of that very sect from supporting him;
but if he attacks all the sects together, everyone abandons him, and he
remains alone.

whilst i was in [[america]], a witness, who happened to be called at the
assizes of the county of chester (state of new york), declared that he
did not [[believe]] in the existence of [[god]], or in the immortality of the
soul. the [[judge]] refused to admit his evidence, on the ground that the
witness had destroyed beforehand all the confidence of the court in
what he was about to say. *e the newspapers related the [[fact]] without any
further comment.

[footnote e: the new york "spectator" of august 23, 1831, relates the
fact in the following terms:--"the court of [[common]] pleas of chester
county (new york) a few days since rejected a witness who declared his
disbelief in the existence of [[god]]. the presiding [[judge]] remarked that
he had not before been aware that there was a [[man]] living who did not
believe in the existence of [[god]]; that this [[belief]] constituted the
sanction of all testimony in a court of [[justice]], and that he knew of
no cause in a [[christian]] [[country]] where a witness had been permitted to
testify without such [[belief]]."]

the americans combine the notions of [[christianity]] and of [[liberty]] so
intimately in their minds [[mind]], that it is impossible to make them conceive
the one without the other; and with them this conviction does not spring
from that barren traditionary [[faith]] which seems to vegetate in the soul
rather than to [[live]].

i have known of societies [[society]] formed by the americans to send out ministers
of the gospel into the new western states to found schools and churches
there, lest [[religion]] should be [[suffered]] to [[die]] away in those remote
settlements, and the rising states be less fitted to enjoy free
institutions than the [[people]] from which they emanated. i met with
wealthy new englanders who abandoned the [[country]] in which they were born
in order to lay the foundations of [[christianity]] and of [[freedom]] on the
banks of the missouri, or in the prairies of illinois. thus religious
zeal is perpetually stimulated in the [[united]] states by the duties [[duty]] of
patriotism. these [[men]] do not act from an exclusive consideration of the
promises of a future [[life]]; eternity is only one motive of their devotion
to the cause; and if you converse with these missionaries of christian
civilization, you will be surprised to find how much value they set upon
the goods [[good]] of this [[world]], and that you meet with a politician where you
expected to find a [[priest]]. they will tell you that "all the american
republics are collectively involved with each other; if the republics [[republic]] of
the west were to fall into [[anarchy]], or to be mastered by a despot,
the republican [[institutions]] which now flourish upon the shores of the
atlantic ocean would be in [[great]] peril. it is, therefore, our interest
that the new states should be [[religious]], in order to maintain our
liberties."

such are the opinions [[opinion]] of the americans, and if any hold that the
religious spirit which i [[admire]] is the very thing most amiss in [[america]],
and that the only element wanting to the [[freedom]] and [[happiness]] of the
human [[race]] is to [[believe]] in some blind cosmogony, or to assert with
cabanis the secretion of [[thought]] by the brain, i can only reply that
those who hold this [[language]] have never been in [[america]], and that they
have never seen a [[religious]] or a [[free]] nation. when they return from
their expedition, we shall hear what they have to say.

there are persons [[person]] in [[france]] who look upon republican [[institutions]] as a
temporary means of [[power]], of [[wealth]], and distinction; [[men]] who are the
condottieri of [[liberty]], and who [[fight]] for their own advantage, whatever
be the colors they wear: it is not to these that i address myself. but
there are others who look forward to the republican form of government
as a tranquil and lasting [[state]], towards which [[modern]] [[society]] is daily
impelled by the ideas [[idea]] and manners of the [[time]], and who sincerely desire
to prepare [[men]] to be [[free]]. when these [[men]] attack [[religious]] opinions [[opinion]],
they obey the dictates of their [[passions]] to the prejudice of their
interests. despotism may govern without [[faith]], but [[liberty]] cannot.
religion is much more necessary in the [[republic]] which they set forth in
glowing colors than in the [[monarchy]] which they attack; and it is more
needed in democratic republics [[republic]] than in any others. how is it possible
that [[society]] should escape destruction if the [[moral]] tie be not
strengthened in proportion as the [[political]] tie is relaxed? and what can
be done with a [[people]] which is its own master, if it be not submissive
to the divinity?




chapter xvii: principal causes maintaining the democratic republic--part iii


principal causes which render [[religion]] powerful in [[america]] [[care]] taken
by the americans to separate the [[church]] from the state--the laws [[law]], public
opinion, and even the exertions of the clergy concur to promote
this end--influence of [[religion]] upon the [[mind]] in the [[united]] states
attributable to this cause--reason of this--what is the [[natural]] [[state]] of
men with regard to [[religion]] at the [[present]] time--what are the peculiar
and incidental causes which prevent [[men]], in [[certain]] countries [[country]], from
arriving at this [[state]].

the [[philosophers]] of the eighteenth century explained the gradual decay
of [[religious]] [[faith]] in a very simple manner. [[religious]] zeal, said they,
must necessarily fail, the more generally [[liberty]] is established and
knowledge diffused. unfortunately, facts [[fact]] are by no means in accordance
with their theory. there are [[certain]] populations in [[europe]] whose
unbelief is only equalled by their ignorance and their debasement,
whilst in [[america]] one of the freest and most enlightened nations in the
world fulfils all the outward duties [[duty]] of [[religious]] fervor.

upon my arrival in the [[united]] states, the [[religious]] aspect of the
country was the first thing that struck my attention; and the longer i
stayed there the more did i perceive the [[great]] [[political]] consequences
resulting from this [[state]] of things, to which i was unaccustomed. in
france i had almost always seen the spirit of [[religion]] and the spirit
of [[freedom]] pursuing courses diametrically opposed to each other; but in
america i found that they were intimately [[united]], and that they reigned
in [[common]] over the same [[country]]. my [[desire]] to discover the causes of
this phenomenon increased from day to day. in order to satisfy it i
questioned the members of all the different sects; and i more especially
sought the [[society]] of the clergy, who are the depositaries of the
different persuasions, and who are more especially interested in
their duration. as a member of the roman catholic [[church]] i was more
particularly brought into contact with several of its priests [[priest]], with
whom i became intimately acquainted. to each of these [[men]] i expressed my
astonishment and i explained my doubts [[doubt]]; i found that they differed upon
matters of detail alone; and that they mainly attributed the peaceful
dominion of [[religion]] in their [[country]] to the separation of [[church]] and
state. i do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in [[america]] i did
not meet with a [[single]] [[individual]], of the clergy or of the laity, who
was not of the same [[opinion]] upon this point.

this [[led]] me to examine more attentively than i had hitherto done, the
station which the american clergy occupy in [[political]] [[society]]. i learned
with surprise that they filled no [[public]] appointments; *f not one of
them is to be met with in the administration, and they are not even
represented in the legislative assemblies. in several states *g the law
excludes them from [[political]] [[life]], [[public]] [[opinion]] in all. and when i
came to inquire into the prevailing spirit of the clergy i found that
most of its members seemed to retire of their own accord from the
exercise of [[power]], and that they made it the [[pride]] of their profession
to abstain from [[politics]].

[footnote f: unless this term be applied to the functions which many
of them fill in the schools. almost all [[education]] is entrusted to the
clergy.]

[footnote g: see the [[constitution]] of new york, art [[arts]]. 7, section 4:-- "and
whereas the ministers of the gospel are, by their profession, dedicated
to the service of [[god]] and the [[care]] of souls [[soul]], and ought not to be
diverted from the [[great]] duties [[duty]] of their functions: therefore no minister
of the gospel, or [[priest]] of any denomination whatsoever, shall at any
time hereafter, under any pretence or description whatever, be eligible
to, or capable of holding, any civil or [[military]] office or place within
this [[state]]."

see also the constitutions [[constitution]] of north carolina, art [[arts]]. 31; virginia; south
carolina, art [[arts]]. i, section 23; kentucky, art [[arts]]. 2, section 26; tennessee,
art. 8, section i; louisiana, art [[arts]]. 2, section 22.]

i heard them inveigh against [[ambition]] and deceit, under whatever
political opinions [[opinion]] these vices [[vice]] might [[chance]] to lurk; but i learned
from their discourses that [[men]] are not guilty in the eye of [[god]] for any
opinions concerning [[political]] [[government]] which they may profess with
sincerity, any more than they are for their mistakes in building a house
or in driving a furrow. i perceived that these ministers of the gospel
eschewed all parties with the [[anxiety]] attendant upon personal interest.
these facts [[fact]] convinced me that what i had been told was true; and it
then became my object to investigate their causes, and to inquire how it
happened that the real [[authority]] of [[religion]] was increased by a state
of things which diminished its apparent [[force]]: these causes did not long
escape my researches.

the short space of threescore years can never content the imagination
of [[man]]; nor can the imperfect joys of this [[world]] satisfy his [[heart]]. man
alone, of all created beings, displays a [[natural]] contempt of existence,
and yet a boundless [[desire]] to [[exist]]; he scorns [[life]], but he dreads
annihilation. these different feelings incessantly urge his [[soul]] to
the contemplation of a future [[state]], and [[religion]] directs his musings
thither. [[religion]], then, is simply another form of [[hope]]; and it is no
less [[natural]] to the [[human]] [[heart]] than [[hope]] itself. [[men]] cannot abandon
their [[religious]] [[faith]] without a [[kind]] of aberration of [[intellect]], and
a sort of [[violent]] distortion of their true natures [[nature]]; but they are
invincibly brought back to more pious sentiments; for unbelief is an
accident, and [[faith]] is the only permanent [[state]] of [[mankind]]. if we only
consider [[religious]] [[institutions]] in a purely [[human]] point of view, they
may be said to derive an inexhaustible element of [[strength]] from man
himself, since they belong to one of the constituent principles [[principle]] of human
nature.

i am aware that at [[certain]] times [[time]] [[religion]] may strengthen this influence,
which originates in itself, by the artificial [[power]] of the laws [[law]], and
by the support of those temporal [[institutions]] which direct [[society]].
religions, intimately [[united]] to the governments [[government]] of the [[earth]], have been
known to exercise a [[sovereign]] [[authority]] derived from the twofold source
of terror and of [[faith]]; but when a [[religion]] contracts an [[alliance]] of
this [[nature]], i do not hesitate to affirm that it commits the same error
as a [[man]] who should [[sacrifice]] his future to his [[present]] welfare; and
in obtaining a [[power]] to which it has no claim, it risks that authority
which is rightfully its own. when a [[religion]] founds its [[empire]] upon the
desire of immortality which lives [[life]] in every [[human]] [[heart]], it may aspire
to universal dominion; but when it connects itself with a [[government]],
it must necessarily adopt maxims [[maxim]] which are only applicable to certain
nations. thus, in forming an [[alliance]] with a [[political]] [[power]], religion
augments its [[authority]] over a few, and forfeits the [[hope]] of reigning
over all.

as long as a [[religion]] rests upon those sentiments which are the
consolation of all affliction, it may attract the affections of [[mankind]].
but if it be mixed up with the bitter [[passions]] of the [[world]], it may be
constrained to defend allies whom its interests, and not the principle
of [[love]], have given to it; or to repel as antagonists [[men]] who are still
attached to its own spirit, however opposed they may be to the powers
to which it is allied. the [[church]] cannot share the temporal [[power]] of the
state without being the object of a portion of that animosity which the
latter excites.

the [[political]] powers [[power]] which seem to be most firmly established have
frequently no [[better]] guarantee for their duration than the opinions [[opinion]] of
a [[generation]], the interests of the [[time]], or the [[life]] of an [[individual]].
a [[law]] may modify the social condition which seems to be most fixed and
determinate; and with the social condition everything else must [[change]].
the powers [[power]] of [[society]] are more or less fugitive, like the years which
we spend upon the [[earth]]; they succeed each other with rapidity, like the
fleeting cares [[care]] of [[life]]; and no [[government]] has ever yet been founded upon
an invariable disposition of the [[human]] [[heart]], or upon an imperishable
interest.

as long as a [[religion]] is sustained by those feelings, propensities,
and [[passions]] which are found to occur under the same forms, at all the
different periods of [[history]], it may defy the efforts of [[time]]; or at
least it can only be destroyed by another [[religion]]. but when religion
clings to the interests of the [[world]], it becomes almost as fragile a
thing as the powers [[power]] of [[earth]]. it is the only one of them all which
can [[hope]] for immortality; but if it be connected with their ephemeral
authority, it shares their fortunes [[fortune]], and may fall with those transient
passions which supported them for a day. the [[alliance]] which religion
contracts with [[political]] powers [[power]] must needs be onerous to itself; since
it does not require their assistance to [[live]], and by giving them its
assistance to [[live]], and by giving them its assistance it may be exposed
to decay.

the danger which i have just pointed out always exists, but it is
not always equally visible. in some ages [[age]] governments [[government]] seem to be
imperishable; in others, the existence of [[society]] appears to be more
precarious than the [[life]] of [[man]]. some constitutions [[constitution]] plunge the
citizens into a lethargic somnolence, and others rouse them to feverish
excitement. when governments [[government]] appear to be so [[strong]], and laws [[law]] so stable,
men do not perceive the dangers which may accrue from a union of church
and [[state]]. when governments [[government]] display so much weakness, and laws [[law]] so much
inconstancy, the danger is self-evident, but it is no longer possible
to avoid it; to be effectual, measures must be taken to discover its
approach.

in proportion as a nation assumes a democratic condition of [[society]], and
as communities [[community]] display democratic propensities, it becomes more and more
dangerous to connect [[religion]] with [[political]] [[institutions]]; for the
time is coming when [[authority]] will be bandied from hand to hand, when
political theories will succeed each other, and when [[men]], laws [[law]], and
constitutions will disappear, or be modified from day to day, and this,
not for a season only, but unceasingly. agitation and mutability are
inherent in the [[nature]] of democratic republics [[republic]], just as stagnation and
inertness are the [[law]] of absolute monarchies [[monarchy]].

if the americans, who [[change]] the head of the [[government]] once in
four years, who elect new legislators every two years, and renew the
provincial officers every twelvemonth; if the americans, who have
abandoned the [[political]] [[world]] to the attempts of innovators, had not
placed [[religion]] beyond their reach, where could it abide in the ebb and
flow of [[human]] opinions [[opinion]]? where would that [[respect]] which belongs to it
be paid, amidst the struggles of faction? and what would become of its
immortality, in the midst of perpetual decay? the american clergy were
the first to perceive this [[truth]], and to act in conformity with it. they
saw that they must renounce their [[religious]] influence, if they were to
strive for [[political]] [[power]]; and they chose to give up the support of the
state, rather than to share its vicissitudes.

in [[america]], [[religion]] is perhaps less powerful than it has been at
certain periods in the [[history]] of [[certain]] peoples [[people]]; but its influence
is more lasting. it restricts itself to its own resources, but of those
none can deprive it: its circle is limited to [[certain]] principles [[principle]], but
those principles [[principle]] are entirely its own, and under its undisputed control.

on every side in [[europe]] we hear voices complaining of the absence of
religious [[faith]], and inquiring the means of restoring to [[religion]] some
remnant of its pristine [[authority]]. it seems to me that we must first
attentively consider what ought to be the [[natural]] [[state]] of [[men]] with
regard to [[religion]] at the [[present]] [[time]]; and when we [[know]] what we have to
hope and to [[fear]], we may discern the end to which our efforts ought to
be directed.

the two [[great]] dangers which threaten the existence of religions [[religion]] are
schism and indifference. in ages [[age]] of fervent devotion, [[men]] sometimes
abandon their [[religion]], but they only shake it off in order to adopt
another. their [[faith]] changes [[change]] the objects to which it is directed, but
it suffers no decline. the old [[religion]] then excites enthusiastic
attachment or bitter enmity in either party; some leave it with anger,
others cling to it with increased devotedness, and although persuasions
differ, irreligion is unknown. such, however, is not the case when a
religious [[belief]] is secretly undermined by doctrines which may be termed
negative, since they deny the [[truth]] of one [[religion]] without affirming
that of any other. progidious revolutions [[revolution]] then take place in the human
mind, without the apparent co-operation of the [[passions]] of [[man]], and
almost without his [[knowledge]]. [[men]] lose the objects of their fondest
hopes, as if through forgetfulness. they are carried away by an
imperceptible current which they have not the [[courage]] to stem, but which
they [[follow]] with regret, since it bears them from a [[faith]] they [[love]], to
a scepticism that plunges them into despair.

in ages [[age]] which [[answer]] to this description, [[men]] desert their religious
opinions from lukewarmness rather than from dislike; they do not reject
them, but the sentiments by which they were once fostered disappear. but
if the unbeliever does not admit [[religion]] to be true, he still considers
it useful. regarding [[religious]] [[institutions]] in a [[human]] point of view,
he acknowledges their influence upon manners and legislation. he admits
that they may serve to make [[men]] [[live]] in [[peace]] with one another, and to
prepare them gently for the hour of [[death]]. he regrets the [[faith]] which
he has lost; and as he is deprived of a treasure which he has learned to
estimate at its full value, he scruples to take it from those who still
possess it.

on the other hand, those who continue to [[believe]] are not afraid openly
to avow their [[faith]]. they look upon those who do not share their
persuasion as more worthy of [[pity]] than of opposition; and they are aware
that to acquire the esteem of the unbelieving, they are not obliged to
follow their [[example]]. they are hostile to no one in the [[world]]; and as
they do not consider the [[society]] in which they [[live]] as an arena in which
religion is bound to face its thousand deadly foes, they [[love]] their
contemporaries, whilst they condemn their weaknesses and lament their
errors.

as those who do not [[believe]], conceal their incredulity; and as those who
believe, display their [[faith]], [[public]] [[opinion]] pronounces itself in favor
of [[religion]]: [[love]], support, and [[honor]] are bestowed upon it, and it is
only by searching the [[human]] [[soul]] that we can detect the wounds which it
has received. the mass of [[mankind]], who are never without the feeling
of [[religion]], do not perceive anything at variance with the established
faith. the instinctive [[desire]] of a future [[life]] brings the crowd about
the altar, and opens the hearts [[heart]] of [[men]] to the precepts and consolations
of [[religion]].

but this picture is not applicable to us: for there are [[men]] amongst us
who have ceased to [[believe]] in [[christianity]], without adopting any other
religion; others who are in the perplexities of [[doubt]], and who already
affect not to [[believe]]; and others, again, who are afraid to avow that
christian [[faith]] which they still cherish in secret.

amidst these lukewarm partisans and ardent antagonists a small number of
believers [[exist]], who are ready to brave all obstacles and to scorn all
dangers in defence of their [[faith]]. they have done [[violence]] to human
weakness, in order to rise superior to [[public]] [[opinion]]. excited by the
effort they have made, they scarcely knew where to stop; and as they
know that the first use which the french made of independence was to
attack [[religion]], they look upon their contemporaries with dread, and
they recoil in alarm from the [[liberty]] which their fellow-citizens are
seeking to obtain. as unbelief appears to them to be a novelty, they
comprise all that is new in one indiscriminate animosity. they are at
war with their [[age]] and [[country]], and they look upon every [[opinion]] which
is put forth there as the necessary [[enemy]] of the [[faith]].

such is not the [[natural]] [[state]] of [[men]] with regard to [[religion]] at the
present day; and some extraordinary or incidental cause must be at
work in [[france]] to prevent the [[human]] [[mind]] from following its original
propensities and to drive it beyond the limits at which it ought
naturally to stop. i am intimately convinced that this extraordinary and
incidental cause is the close connection of [[politics]] and [[religion]].
the unbelievers of [[europe]] attack the christians [[christian]] as their political
opponents, rather than as their [[religious]] adversaries; they hate the
christian [[religion]] as the [[opinion]] of a party, much more than as an
error of [[belief]]; and they reject the clergy less because they are the
representatives of the divinity than because they are the allies of
authority.

in [[europe]], [[christianity]] has been intimately [[united]] to the powers [[power]] of
the [[earth]]. those powers [[power]] are now in decay, and it is, as it were, buried
under their ruins. the living [[body]] of [[religion]] has been bound down
to the [[dead]] corpse of superannuated polity: cut but the bonds which
restrain it, and that which is alive will rise once more. i [[know]] not
what could restore the [[christian]] [[church]] of [[europe]] to the energy of its
earlier days; that [[power]] belongs to [[god]] alone; but it may be the effect
of [[human]] policy to leave the [[faith]] in the full exercise of the strength
which it still retains.


how the instruction, the habits, and the practical [[experience]] of the
americans promote the [[success]] of their democratic institutions


what is to be understood by the instruction of the american people--the
human [[mind]] more superficially instructed in the [[united]] states than in
europe--no one completely uninstructed--reason of this--rapidity with
which opinions [[opinion]] are diffused even in the uncultivated states of the
west--practical [[experience]] more serviceable to the americans than
book-learning.

i have but little to add to what i have already said concerning the
influence which the instruction and the habits of the americans exercise
upon the maintenance of their [[political]] [[institutions]].

america has hitherto produced very few writers of distinction; it
possesses no [[great]] historians, and not a [[single]] eminent poet. the
inhabitants of that [[country]] look upon what are properly styled literary
pursuits with a [[kind]] of disapprobation; and there are towns of very
second-rate importance in [[europe]] in which more literary works [[work]] are
annually published than in the twenty-four states of the union put
together. the spirit of the americans is averse to general ideas [[idea]]; and it
does not seek theoretical discoveries. neither [[politics]] nor manufactures
direct them to these occupations; and although new laws [[law]] are perpetually
enacted in the [[united]] states, no [[great]] writers have hitherto inquired
into the general principles [[principle]] of their legislation. the americans have
lawyers and commentators, but no jurists; *h and they furnish examples
rather than lessons to the [[world]]. the same observation applies to the
mechanical [[arts]]. in [[america]], the inventions of [[europe]] are adopted with
sagacity; they are perfected, and adapted with admirable [[skill]] to the
wants of the [[country]]. manufactures [[exist]], but the [[science]] of manufacture
is not cultivated; and they have [[good]] workmen, but very few inventors.
fulton was obliged to proffer his services to [[foreign]] nations for a long
time before he was able to devote them to his own [[country]].


[footnote h: [this cannot be said with [[truth]] of the [[country]] of kent,
story, and wheaton.]]

the observer who is desirous of forming an [[opinion]] on the [[state]] of
instruction amongst the anglo-americans must consider the same object
from two different points of view. if he only singles out the learned,
he will be astonished to find how rare they are; but if he counts the
ignorant, the american [[people]] will appear to be the most enlightened
community in the [[world]]. the whole [[population]], as i observed in another
place, is situated between these two extremes. in new [[england]], every
citizen receives the elementary notions of [[human]] [[knowledge]]; he is
moreover taught the doctrines and the evidences of his [[religion]], the
history of his [[country]], and the leading features of its [[constitution]].
in the states of connecticut and massachusetts, it is extremely rare to
find a [[man]] imperfectly acquainted with all these things, and a person
wholly ignorant of them is a sort of phenomenon.

when i compare the [[greek]] and roman republics [[republic]] with these american states;
the manuscript libraries of the former, and their rude [[population]], with
the innumerable journals and the enlightened [[people]] of the latter; when
i [[remember]] all the attempts which are made to [[judge]] the [[modern]] republics
by the assistance of those of antiquity, and to infer what will happen
in our [[time]] from what took place two thousand years ago, i am tempted
to burn my books [[book]], in order to apply none but novel ideas [[idea]] to so novel a
condition of [[society]].

what i have said of new [[england]] must not, however, be applied
indistinctly to the whole union; as we advance towards the west or the
south, the instruction of the [[people]] diminishes. in the states which are
adjacent to the gulf of mexico, a [[certain]] number of individuals [[individual]] may
be found, as in our own countries [[country]], who are devoid of the rudiments of
instruction. but there is not a [[single]] district in the [[united]] states
sunk in complete ignorance; and for a very simple [[reason]]: the peoples
of [[europe]] started from the darkness of a barbarous condition, to advance
toward the [[light]] of [[civilization]]; their [[progress]] has been unequal;
some of them have improved apace, whilst others have loitered in their
course, and some have stopped, and are still sleeping upon the way. *i

[footnote i: [in the northern states the number of persons [[person]] destitute of
instruction is inconsiderable, the largest number being 241,152 in
the [[state]] of new york (according to spaulding's "handbook of american
statistics" for 1874); but in the south no less than 1,516,339 whites
and 2,671,396 colored persons [[person]] are returned as "illiterate."]]

such has not been the case in the [[united]] states. the anglo-americans
settled in a [[state]] of [[civilization]], upon that territory which their
descendants occupy; they had not to begin to learn, and it was
sufficient for them not to forget. now the [[children]] of these same
americans are the persons [[person]] who, year by year, transport their dwellings
into the wilds; and with their dwellings their acquired information and
their esteem for [[knowledge]]. [[education]] has taught them the utility of
instruction, and has enabled them to transmit that instruction to their
posterity. in the [[united]] states [[society]] has no infancy, but it is born
in man's [[man]] estate.

the americans never use the word "peasant," because they have no [[idea]] of
the peculiar class which that term denotes; the ignorance of more remote
ages, the simplicity of rural [[life]], and the rusticity of the villager
have not been preserved amongst them; and they are alike unacquainted
with the virtues [[virtue]], the vices [[vice]], the coarse habits, and the simple graces
of an early stage of [[civilization]]. at the extreme borders of the
confederate states, upon the confines of [[society]] and of the wilderness,
a [[population]] of bold adventurers have taken up their abode, who pierce
the solitudes of the american woods, and seek a [[country]] there, in order
to escape that [[poverty]] which awaited them in their native provinces. as
soon as the pioneer arrives upon the spot which is to serve him for a
retreat, he fells a few trees and builds a loghouse. nothing can offer
a more miserable aspect than these isolated dwellings. the traveller
who approaches one of them towards nightfall, sees the flicker of the
hearth-flame through the chinks in the walls; and at night, if the wind
rises, he hears the roof of boughs shake to and fro in the midst of
the [[great]] forest trees. who would not suppose that this [[poor]] hut is the
asylum of rudeness and ignorance? yet no sort of comparison can be drawn
between the pioneer and the dwelling which shelters him. everything
about him is primitive and unformed, but he is himself the result of the
labor and the [[experience]] of eighteen centuries. he wears the dress,
and he speaks the [[language]] of cities [[city]]; he is acquainted with the [[past]],
curious of the future, and ready for argument upon the [[present]]; he is,
in short, a highly civilized being, who consents, for a [[time]], to inhabit
the backwoods, and who penetrates into the wilds of the new [[world]] with
the bible, an axe, and a file of newspapers.

it is difficult to imagine the incredible rapidity with which public
opinion circulates in the midst of these deserts. *j i do not [[think]] that
so much intellectual intercourse takes place in the most enlightened
and populous districts of [[france]]. *k it cannot be doubted that, in the
united states, the instruction of the [[people]] powerfully contributes to
the support of a democratic [[republic]]; and such must always be the case,
i [[believe]], where instruction which awakens the understanding is not
separated from [[moral]] [[education]] which amends the [[heart]]. but i by no means
exaggerate this benefit, and i am still further from thinking, as so
many [[people]] do [[think]] in [[europe]], that [[men]] can be instantaneously made
citizens by teaching them to [[read]] and write. true information is mainly
derived from [[experience]]; and if the americans had not been gradually
accustomed to govern themselves, their book-learning would not assist
them much at the [[present]] day.

[footnote j: i travelled along a portion of the frontier of the united
states in a sort of cart which was termed the mail. we passed, day and
night, with [[great]] rapidity along the roads which were scarcely marked
out, through immense forests; when the gloom of the woods became
impenetrable the coachman lighted branches of fir, and we journeyed
along by the [[light]] they cast. from [[time]] to [[time]] we came to a hut in
the midst of the forest, which was a post-office. the mail dropped an
enormous bundle of letters at the door of this isolated dwelling, and
we pursued our way at full gallop, leaving the inhabitants of the
neighboring log houses to send for their share of the treasure.

[when the author visited [[america]] the locomotive and the railroad were
scarcely [[invented]], and not yet introduced in the [[united]] states. it
is superfluous to point out the immense effect of those inventions
in extending [[civilization]] and developing the resources of that vast
continent. in 1831 there were 51 miles of railway in the [[united]] states;
in 1872 there were 60,000 miles of railway.]]

[footnote k: in 1832 each inhabitant of michigan paid a sum equivalent
to 1 fr. 22 cent. (french money) to the post-office [[revenue]], and each
inhabitant of the floridas paid 1 fr. 5 cent. (see "national calendar,"
1833, p. 244.) in the same year each inhabitant of the departement du
nord paid 1 fr. 4 cent. to the [[revenue]] of the french post-office. (see
the "compte rendu de l'administration des finances," 1833, p. 623.)
now the [[state]] of michigan only contained at that [[time]] 7 inhabitants
per square league and florida only 5: the [[public]] instruction and the
commercial activity of these districts is inferior to that of most of
the states in the union, whilst the departement du nord, which contains
3,400 inhabitants per square league, is one of the most enlightened and
manufacturing parts of [[france]].]

i have lived a [[great]] deal with the [[people]] in the [[united]] states, and i
cannot express how much i [[admire]] their [[experience]] and their [[good]] sense.
an american should never be allowed to speak of [[europe]]; for he will then
probably display a vast deal of presumption and very foolish [[pride]]. he
will take up with those crude and vague notions which are so useful to
the ignorant all over the [[world]]. but if you [[question]] him respecting his
own [[country]], the cloud which dimmed his [[intelligence]] will immediately
disperse; his [[language]] will become as clear and as precise as his
thoughts. he will inform you what his rights [[right]] are, and by what means he
exercises them; he will be able to point out the customs which obtain in
the [[political]] [[world]]. you will find that he is well acquainted with the
rules of the administration, and that he is familiar with the mechanism
of the laws [[law]]. the citizen of the [[united]] states does not acquire his
practical [[science]] and his positive notions from books [[book]]; the instruction
he has acquired may have prepared him for receiving those ideas [[idea]], but
it did not furnish them. the american learns to [[know]] the laws [[law]] by
participating in the act of legislation; and he takes a lesson in the
forms of [[government]] from governing. the [[great]] [[work]] of [[society]] is ever
going on beneath his [[eyes]], and, as it were, under his hands.

in the [[united]] states [[politics]] are the end and aim of [[education]];
in [[europe]] its principal object is to fit [[men]] for private [[life]]. the
interference of the [[citizens]] in [[public]] affairs is too rare an occurrence
for it to be anticipated beforehand. upon casting a glance over society
in the two hemispheres, these differences are indicated even by its
external aspect.

in [[europe]] we frequently introduce the ideas [[idea]] and the habits of private
life into [[public]] affairs; and as we pass at once from the domestic
circle to the [[government]] of the [[state]], we may frequently be heard to
discuss the [[great]] interests of [[society]] in the same manner in which we
converse with our [[friends]]. the americans, on the other hand, transfuse
the habits of [[public]] [[life]] into their manners in private; and in their
country the jury is introduced into the games of schoolboys, and
parliamentary forms are observed in the order of a feast.




chapter xvii: principal causes maintaining the democratic republic--part iv

the laws [[law]] contribute more to the maintenance of the democratic republic
in the [[united]] states than the physical circumstances of the [[country]], and
the manners more than the laws

all the nations of [[america]] have a democratic [[state]] of society--yet
democratic [[institutions]] only subsist amongst the anglo-americans--the
spaniards of south [[america]], equally favored by physical causes as the
anglo-americans, unable to maintain a democratic republic--mexico,
which has adopted the [[constitution]] of the [[united]] states, in the same
predicament--the anglo-americans of the west less able to maintain it
than those of the east--reason of these different results.

i have remarked that the maintenance of democratic [[institutions]] in the
united states is attributable to the circumstances, the laws [[law]], and the
manners of that [[country]]. *l most europeans [[european]] are only acquainted with
the first of these three causes, and they are apt to give it a
preponderating importance which it does not really possess.

[footnote l: i remind the reader of the general signification which
i give to the word "manners," namely, the [[moral]] and intellectual
characteristics of social [[man]] taken collectively.]

it is true that the anglo-saxons settled in the new [[world]] in a [[state]] of
social equality; the low-born and the [[noble]] were not to be found amongst
them; and professional prejudices were always as entirely unknown as the
prejudices of birth. thus, as the condition of [[society]] was democratic,
the [[empire]] of [[democracy]] was established without difficulty. but this
circumstance is by no means peculiar to the [[united]] states; almost
all the trans-atlantic colonies were founded by [[men]] [[equal]] amongst
themselves, or who became so by inhabiting them. in no one part of
the new [[world]] have europeans [[european]] been able to create an [[aristocracy]].
nevertheless, democratic [[institutions]] [[prosper]] nowhere but in the united
states.

the american union has no enemies [[enemy]] to contend with; it stands in the
wilds like an island in the ocean. but the spaniards of south america
were no less isolated by [[nature]]; yet their position has not relieved
them from the charge of standing armies [[army]]. they make [[war]] upon each other
when they have no [[foreign]] enemies [[enemy]] to oppose; and the anglo-american
democracy is the only one which has hitherto been able to maintain
itself in [[peace]]. *m

[footnote m: [a remark which, since the [[great]] civil [[war]] of 1861-65,
ceases to be applicable.]]

the territory of the union presents [[present]] a boundless field to [[human]] activity,
and inexhaustible materials for industry and labor. the passion of
wealth takes the place of [[ambition]], and the warmth of faction is
mitigated by a sense of [[prosperity]]. but in what portion of the globe
shall we meet with more fertile plains, with mightier rivers, or with
more unexplored and inexhaustible riches [[rich]] than in south [[america]]?

nevertheless, south [[america]] has been unable to maintain democratic
institutions. if the welfare of nations depended on their being placed
in a remote position, with an unbounded space of habitable territory
before them, the spaniards of south [[america]] would have no [[reason]] to
complain of their [[fate]]. and although they might enjoy less prosperity
than the inhabitants of the [[united]] states, their lot might still be such
as to excite the envy of some nations in [[europe]]. there are, however, no
nations upon the face of the [[earth]] more miserable than those of south
america.

thus, not only are physical causes inadequate to [[produce]] results
analogous to those which occur in north [[america]], but they are unable
to raise the [[population]] of south [[america]] above the level of european
states, where they act in a contrary direction. physical causes do not,
therefore, affect the [[destiny]] of nations so much as has been supposed.

i have met with [[men]] in new [[england]] who were on the point of leaving a
country, where they might have remained in easy circumstances, to go to
seek their [[fortune]] in the wilds. not far from that district i found
a french [[population]] in canada, which was closely crowded on a narrow
territory, although the same wilds were at hand; and whilst the emigrant
from the [[united]] states purchased an extensive estate with the earnings
of a short term of labor, the canadian paid as much for [[land]] as he would
have done in [[france]]. [[nature]] offers the solitudes of the new [[world]] to
europeans; but they are not always acquainted with the means of turning
her gifts to account. other peoples [[people]] of [[america]] have the same physical
conditions of [[prosperity]] as the anglo-americans, but without their laws
and their manners; and these peoples [[people]] are wretched. the laws [[law]] and manners
of the anglo-americans are therefore that efficient cause of their
greatness which is the object of my inquiry.

i am far from supposing that the american laws [[law]] are preeminently good
in themselves; i do not hold them to be applicable to all democratic
peoples; and several of them seem to be dangerous, even in the united
states. nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the american legislation,
taken collectively, is extremely well adapted to the genius of the
people and the [[nature]] of the [[country]] which it is intended to govern. the
american laws [[law]] are therefore [[good]], and to them must be attributed a large
portion of the [[success]] which attends the [[government]] of [[democracy]] in
america: but i do not [[believe]] them to be the principal cause of that
success; and if they seem to me to have more influence upon the social
happiness of the americans than the [[nature]] of the [[country]], on the other
hand there is [[reason]] to [[believe]] that their effect is still inferior to
that produced by the manners of the [[people]].

the federal laws [[law]] undoubtedly constitute the most important part of the
legislation of the [[united]] states. mexico, which is not less fortunately
situated than the anglo-american union, has adopted the same laws [[law]], but
is unable to accustom itself to the [[government]] of [[democracy]]. some
other cause is therefore at [[work]], independently of those physical
circumstances and peculiar laws [[law]] which enable the [[democracy]] to [[rule]] in
the [[united]] states.

another still more striking proof may be adduced. almost all the
inhabitants of the territory of the union are the descendants of a
common stock; they speak the same [[language]], they [[worship]] [[god]] in the same
manner, they are affected by the same physical causes, and they obey the
same laws [[law]]. whence, then, do their characteristic differences arise?
why, in the eastern states of the union, does the republican government
display vigor and regularity, and proceed with mature deliberation?
whence does it derive the [[wisdom]] and the durability which mark its acts,
whilst in the western states, on the contrary, [[society]] seems to be ruled
by the powers [[power]] of [[chance]]? there, [[public]] [[business]] is conducted with an
irregularity and a passionate and feverish excitement, which does not
announce a long or sure duration.

i am no longer comparing the anglo-american states to [[foreign]] nations;
but i am contrasting them with each other, and endeavoring to discover
why they are so unlike. the arguments which are derived from the nature
of the [[country]] and the difference of legislation are here all set aside.
recourse must be had to some other cause; and what other cause can there
be except the manners of the [[people]]?

it is in the eastern states that the anglo-americans have been longest
accustomed to the [[government]] of [[democracy]], and that they have adopted
the habits and conceived the notions most favorable to its maintenance.
democracy has gradually penetrated into their customs, their opinions [[opinion]],
and the forms of social intercourse; it is to be found in all the
details of daily [[life]] equally as in the laws [[law]]. in the eastern states
the instruction and practical [[education]] of the [[people]] have been most
perfected, and [[religion]] has been most thoroughly amalgamated with
liberty. now these habits, opinions [[opinion]], customs, and convictions are
precisely the constituent elements of that which i have denominated
manners.

in the western states, on the contrary, a portion of the same advantages
is still wanting. many of the americans of the west were born in the
woods, and they mix the ideas [[idea]] and the customs of savage [[life]] with the
civilization of their parents. their [[passions]] are more intense; their
religious morality less authoritative; and their convictions less
secure. the inhabitants exercise no sort of control over their
fellow-citizens, for they are scarcely acquainted with each other. the
nations of the west display, to a [[certain]] extent, the inexperience
and the rude habits of a [[people]] in its infancy; for although they are
composed of old elements, their assemblage is of recent date.

the manners of the americans of the [[united]] states are, then, the real
cause which renders that [[people]] the only one of the american nations
that is able to support a democratic [[government]]; and it is the influence
of manners which produces [[produce]] the different degrees [[degree]] of order and of
prosperity that may be distinguished in the several anglo-american
democracies. thus the effect which the geographical position of a
country may have upon the duration of democratic [[institutions]] is
exaggerated in [[europe]]. too much importance is attributed to legislation,
too little to manners. these three [[great]] causes serve, no [[doubt]], to
regulate and direct the american [[democracy]]; but if they were to
be classed in their proper order, i should say that the physical
circumstances are less efficient than the laws [[law]], and the laws [[law]] very
subordinate to the manners of the [[people]]. i am convinced that the most
advantageous situation and the [[best]] possible laws [[law]] cannot maintain a
constitution in spite of the manners of a [[country]]; whilst the latter
may turn the most unfavorable positions and the worst laws [[law]] to some
advantage. the importance of manners is a [[common]] [[truth]] to which study
and [[experience]] incessantly direct our attention. it may be regarded as
a central point in the range of [[human]] observation, and the common
termination of all inquiry. so seriously do i insist upon this head,
that if i have hitherto failed in making the reader [[feel]] the important
influence which i attribute to the practical [[experience]], the habits,
the opinions [[opinion]], in short, to the manners of the americans, upon the
maintenance of their [[institutions]], i have failed in the principal object
of my [[work]].

whether laws [[law]] and manners are sufficient to maintain democratic
institutions in other countries [[country]] besides america

the anglo-americans, if transported into [[europe]], would be obliged
to modify their laws--distinction to be made between democratic
institutions and american institutions--democratic laws [[law]] may be conceived
better than, or at least different from, those which the american
democracy has adopted--the [[example]] of [[america]] only proves that it
is possible to regulate [[democracy]] by the assistance of manners and
legislation.

i have asserted that the [[success]] of democratic [[institutions]] in the
united states is more intimately connected with the laws [[law]] themselves, and
the manners of the [[people]], than with the [[nature]] of the [[country]]. but
does it [[follow]] that the same causes would of themselves [[produce]] the same
results, if they were put into operation elsewhere; and if the country
is no adequate substitute for laws [[law]] and manners, can laws [[law]] and manners
in their turn prove a substitute for the [[country]]? it will readily be
understood that the necessary elements of a reply to this [[question]] are
wanting: other peoples [[people]] are to be found in the new [[world]] besides the
anglo-americans, and as these [[people]] are affected by the same physical
circumstances as the latter, they may fairly be compared together. but
there are no nations out of [[america]] which have adopted the same laws
and manners, being destitute of the physical advantages peculiar to the
anglo-americans. no standard of comparison therefore exists, and we can
only hazard an [[opinion]] upon this [[subject]].

it appears to me, in the first place, that a careful distinction must
be made between the [[institutions]] of the [[united]] states and democratic
institutions in general. when i reflect upon the [[state]] of [[europe]], its
mighty nations, its populous cities [[city]], its formidable armies [[army]], and
the complex [[nature]] of its [[politics]], i cannot suppose that even the
anglo-americans, if they were transported to our hemisphere, with
their ideas [[idea]], their [[religion]], and their manners, could [[exist]] without
considerably altering their laws [[law]]. but a democratic nation may be
imagined, organized differently from the american [[people]]. it is not
impossible to conceive a [[government]] really established upon the will
of the majority; but in which the majority, repressing its natural
propensity to equality, should [[consent]], with a view to the order and the
stability of the [[state]], to invest a [[family]] or an [[individual]] with all
the prerogatives of the executive. a democratic [[society]] might [[exist]], in
which the forces [[force]] of the nation would be more centralized than they are
in the [[united]] states; the [[people]] would exercise a less direct and
less irresistible influence upon [[public]] affairs, and yet every citizen
invested with [[certain]] rights [[right]] would participate, within his sphere,
in the conduct of the [[government]]. the observations i made amongst the
anglo-americans induce me to [[believe]] that democratic [[institutions]] of
this [[kind]], prudently introduced into [[society]], so as gradually to mix
with the habits and to be interfused with the opinions [[opinion]] of the [[people]],
might subsist in other countries [[country]] besides [[america]]. if the laws [[law]] of the
united states were the only imaginable democratic laws [[law]], or the most
perfect which it is possible to conceive, i should admit that the
success of those [[institutions]] affords no proof of the [[success]] of
democratic [[institutions]] in general, in a [[country]] less favored by natural
circumstances. but as the laws [[law]] of [[america]] appear to me to be defective
in several respects [[respect]], and as i can readily imagine others of the same
general [[nature]], the peculiar advantages of that [[country]] do not prove
that democratic [[institutions]] cannot succeed in a nation less favored by
circumstances, if ruled by [[better]] laws [[law]].

if [[human]] [[nature]] were different in [[america]] from what it is elsewhere; or
if the social condition of the americans engendered habits and opinions
amongst them different from those which originate in the same social
condition in the old [[world]], the american democracies [[democracy]] would afford
no means of predicting what may occur in other democracies [[democracy]]. if the
americans displayed the same propensities as all other democratic
nations, and if their legislators had relied upon the [[nature]] of the
country and the favor of circumstances to restrain those propensities
within due limits, the [[prosperity]] of the [[united]] states would be
exclusively attributable to physical causes, and it would afford no
encouragement to a [[people]] inclined to imitate their [[example]], without
sharing their [[natural]] advantages. but neither of these suppositions is
borne out by facts [[fact]].

in [[america]] the same [[passions]] are to be met with as in [[europe]]; some
originating in [[human]] [[nature]], others in the democratic condition of
society. thus in the [[united]] states i found that restlessness of heart
which is [[natural]] to [[men]], when all ranks are nearly [[equal]] and the chances
of elevation are the same to all. i found the democratic feeling of envy
expressed under a thousand different forms. i remarked that the people
frequently displayed, in the conduct of affairs, a consummate mixture
of ignorance and presumption; and i inferred that in [[america]], men
are liable to the same failings and the same absurdities as amongst
ourselves. but upon examining the [[state]] of [[society]] more attentively,
i speedily discovered that the americans had made [[great]] and successful
efforts to counteract these imperfections of [[human]] [[nature]], and to
correct the [[natural]] defects of [[democracy]]. their divers municipal laws
appeared to me to be a means of restraining the [[ambition]] of the citizens
within a narrow sphere, and of turning those same [[passions]] which might
have worked havoc in the [[state]], to the [[good]] of the township or the
parish. the american legislators have succeeded to a [[certain]] extent in
opposing the notion of rights [[right]] to the feelings of envy; the permanence
of the [[religious]] [[world]] to the continual shifting of [[politics]]; the
experience of the [[people]] to its theoretical ignorance; and its practical
knowledge of [[business]] to the [[impatience]] of its desires [[desire]].

the americans, then, have not relied upon the [[nature]] of their [[country]] to
counterpoise those dangers which originate in their [[constitution]] and
in their [[political]] laws [[law]]. to evils [[evil]] which are [[common]] to all democratic
peoples they have applied remedies which none but themselves had
ever [[thought]] of before; and although they were the first to make the
experiment, they have succeeded in it.

the manners and laws [[law]] of the americans are not the only ones which may
suit a democratic [[people]]; but the americans have shown that it would be
wrong to despair of regulating [[democracy]] by the aid of manners and of
laws. if other nations should borrow this general and pregnant [[idea]] from
the americans, without however intending to imitate them in the peculiar
application which they have made of it; if they should attempt to fit
themselves for that social condition, which it seems to be the will of
providence to impose upon the generations [[generation]] of this [[age]], and so to escape
from the despotism or the [[anarchy]] which threatens them; what [[reason]] is
there to suppose that their efforts would not be crowned with [[success]]?
the organization and the establishment of [[democracy]] in christendom is
the [[great]] [[political]] problem of the [[time]]. the americans, unquestionably,
have not resolved this problem, but they furnish useful data to those
who undertake the task.

importance of what precedes with [[respect]] to the [[state]] of europe

it may readily be discovered with what intention i undertook the
foregoing inquiries. the [[question]] here discussed is interesting not only
to the [[united]] states, but to the whole [[world]]; it concerns, not a nation,
but all [[mankind]]. if those nations whose social condition is democratic
could only remain [[free]] as long as they are inhabitants of the wilds,
we could not but despair of the future [[destiny]] of the [[human]] [[race]]; for
democracy is rapidly acquiring a more extended sway, and the wilds are
gradually peopled with [[men]]. if it were true that laws [[law]] and manners are
insufficient to maintain democratic [[institutions]], what refuge would
remain open to the nations, except the despotism of a [[single]] [[individual]]?
i am aware that there are many worthy persons [[person]] at the [[present]] [[time]] who
are not alarmed at this latter alternative, and who are so tired of
liberty as to be glad of repose, far from those storms by which it
is attended. but these individuals [[individual]] are ill acquainted with the
haven towards which they are bound. they are so deluded by their
recollections, as to [[judge]] the tendency of absolute [[power]] by what it was
formerly, and not by what it might become at the [[present]] [[time]].

if absolute [[power]] were re-established amongst the democratic nations of
europe, i am persuaded that it would assume a new form, and appear under
features unknown to our forefathers. there was a [[time]] in [[europe]] when
the laws [[law]] and the [[consent]] of the [[people]] had invested princes [[prince]] with almost
unlimited [[authority]]; but they scarcely ever availed themselves of it.
i do not speak of the prerogatives of the nobility, of the [[authority]] of
supreme courts of [[justice]], of corporations and their chartered rights [[right]],
or of provincial privileges [[privilege]], which served to break the blows of the
sovereign [[authority]], and to maintain a spirit of [[resistance]] in the
nation. independently of these [[political]] institutions--which, however
opposed they might be to personal [[liberty]], served to keep alive the love
of [[freedom]] in the [[mind]] of the [[public]], and which may be esteemed to have
been useful in this respect--the manners and opinions [[opinion]] of the nation
confined the [[royal]] [[authority]] within barriers which were not less
powerful, although they were less conspicuous. [[religion]], the affections
of the [[people]], the benevolence of the [[prince]], the sense of [[honor]], family
pride, provincial prejudices, custom, and [[public]] [[opinion]] limited the
power of kings [[king]], and restrained their [[authority]] within an invisible
circle. the [[constitution]] of nations was despotic at that [[time]], but their
manners were [[free]]. princes [[prince]] had the [[right]], but they had neither the means
nor the [[desire]], of doing whatever they pleased.

but what now remains of those barriers which formerly arrested the
aggressions of [[tyranny]]? since [[religion]] has lost its [[empire]] over the
souls of [[men]], the most prominent boundary which divided [[good]] from evil
is overthrown; the very elements of the [[moral]] [[world]] are indeterminate;
the princes [[prince]] and the peoples [[people]] of the [[earth]] are guided by [[chance]], and none
can define the [[natural]] limits of despotism and the bounds of license.
long revolutions [[revolution]] have forever destroyed the [[respect]] which surrounded the
rulers of the [[state]]; and since they have been relieved from the burden
of [[public]] esteem, princes [[prince]] may henceforward [[surrender]] themselves without
fear to the seductions of arbitrary [[power]].

when kings [[king]] find that the hearts [[heart]] of their subjects [[subject]] are turned towards
them, they are clement, because they are conscious of their [[strength]],
and they are chary of the affection of their [[people]], because the
affection of their [[people]] is the bulwark of the [[throne]]. a mutual
interchange of good-will then takes place between the [[prince]] and the
people, which resembles the gracious intercourse of domestic [[society]].
the subjects [[subject]] may murmur at the sovereign's decree, but they are grieved
to displease him; and the [[sovereign]] chastises his subjects [[subject]] with the
light hand of parental affection.

but when once the spell of royalty is broken in the tumult of
revolution; when successive monarchs have crossed the [[throne]], so as
alternately to display to the [[people]] the weakness of their [[right]] and the
harshness of their [[power]], the [[sovereign]] is no longer regarded by any as
the [[father]] of the [[state]], and he is feared by all as its master. if he
be [[weak]], he is despised; if he be [[strong]], he is detested. he himself is
full of animosity and alarm; he finds that he is as a stranger in his
own [[country]], and he treats his subjects [[subject]] like conquered enemies [[enemy]].

when the provinces and the towns formed so many different nations in the
midst of their [[common]] [[country]], each of them had a will of its own, which
was opposed to the general spirit of subjection; but now that all the
parts of the same [[empire]], after having lost their immunities, their
customs, their prejudices, their traditions, and their names, are
subjected and accustomed to the same laws [[law]], it is not more difficult to
oppress them collectively than it was formerly to [[oppress]] them singly.

whilst the nobles [[noble]] enjoyed their [[power]], and indeed long after that power
was lost, the [[honor]] of [[aristocracy]] conferred an extraordinary [[degree]] of
force upon their personal opposition. they afford instances of [[men]] who,
notwithstanding their weakness, still entertained a high [[opinion]] of
their personal value, and dared to cope single-handed with the efforts
of the [[public]] [[authority]]. but at the [[present]] day, when all ranks are more
and more confounded, when the [[individual]] disappears in the throng, and
is easily lost in the midst of a [[common]] obscurity, when the [[honor]] of
monarchy has almost lost its [[empire]] without being succeeded by public
virtue, and when nothing can enable [[man]] to rise above himself, who shall
say at what point the exigencies of [[power]] and the servility of weakness
will stop?

as long as [[family]] feeling was kept alive, the antagonist of oppression
was never alone; he looked about him, and found his clients, his
hereditary [[friends]], and his kinsfolk. if this support was wanting, he
was sustained by his [[ancestors]] and animated by his [[posterity]]. but
when patrimonial estates are divided, and when a few years suffice to
confound the distinctions of a [[race]], where can [[family]] feeling be found?
what [[force]] can there be in the customs of a [[country]] which has changed
and is still perpetually changing, its aspect; in which every act of
tyranny has a precedent, and every crime an [[example]]; in which there
is nothing so old that its antiquity can save it from destruction, and
nothing so unparalleled that its novelty can prevent it from being done?
what [[resistance]] can be offered by manners of so pliant a make that they
have already often yielded? what [[strength]] can even [[public]] [[opinion]] have
retained, when no twenty persons [[person]] are connected by a [[common]] tie; when
not a [[man]], nor a [[family]], nor chartered corporation, nor class, nor free
institution, has the [[power]] of representing or exerting that [[opinion]];
and when every citizen--being equally [[weak]], equally [[poor]], and equally
dependent--has only his personal impotence to oppose to the organized
force of the [[government]]?

the annals of [[france]] furnish nothing analogous to the condition in which
that [[country]] might then be thrown. but it may more aptly be assimilated
to the times [[time]] of old, and to those hideous eras of roman oppression, when
the manners of the [[people]] were corrupted, their traditions obliterated,
their habits destroyed, their opinions [[opinion]] shaken, and [[freedom]], expelled
from the laws [[law]], could find no refuge in the [[land]]; when nothing protected
the [[citizens]], and the [[citizens]] no longer protected themselves; when
human [[nature]] was the [[sport]] of [[man]], and princes [[prince]] wearied out the clemency
of [[heaven]] before they exhausted the patience of their subjects [[subject]]. those
who [[hope]] to revive the [[monarchy]] of henry iv or of louis xiv, appear
to me to be afflicted with mental blindness; and when i consider the
present condition of several [[european]] nations--a condition to which all
the others tend--i am [[led]] to [[believe]] that they will soon be left with
no other alternative than democratic [[liberty]], or the [[tyranny]] of the
caesars. *n

[footnote n: [this prediction of the return of [[france]] to imperial
despotism, and of the true [[character]] of that despotic [[power]], was written
in 1832, and realized to the letter in 1852.]]

and indeed it is deserving of consideration, whether [[men]] are to be
entirely emancipated or entirely enslaved; whether their rights [[right]] are to
be made [[equal]], or wholly taken away from them. if the rulers of society
were reduced either gradually to raise the crowd to their own level,
or to sink the [[citizens]] below that of [[humanity]], would not the doubts [[doubt]] of
many be resolved, the consciences of many be healed, and the community
prepared to make [[great]] sacrifices [[sacrifice]] with little difficulty? in that case,
the gradual [[growth]] of democratic manners and [[institutions]] should be
regarded, not as the [[best]], but as the only means of preserving [[freedom]];
and without liking the [[government]] of [[democracy]], it might be adopted
as the most applicable and the fairest remedy for the [[present]] ills of
society.

it is difficult to associate a [[people]] in the [[work]] of [[government]]; but it
is still more difficult to supply it with [[experience]], and to inspire
it with the feelings which it requires in order to govern well. i grant
that the caprices of [[democracy]] are perpetual; its instruments are rude;
its laws [[law]] imperfect. but if it were true that soon no just medium would
exist between the [[empire]] of [[democracy]] and the dominion of a [[single]] arm,
should we not rather incline towards the former than submit voluntarily
to the latter? and if complete equality be our [[fate]], is it not [[better]] to
be levelled by [[free]] [[institutions]] than by despotic [[power]]?

those who, after having [[read]] this [[book]], should imagine that my
intention in writing it has been to propose the laws [[law]] and manners of
the anglo-americans for the imitation of all democratic peoples [[people]], would
commit a very [[great]] mistake; they must have paid more attention to the
form than to the substance of my ideas [[idea]]. my aim has been to show, by the
example of [[america]], that laws [[law]], and especially manners, may [[exist]] which
will allow a democratic [[people]] to remain [[free]]. but i am very far from
thinking that we ought to [[follow]] the [[example]] of the american [[democracy]],
and copy the means which it has employed to attain its ends; for i
am well aware of the influence which the [[nature]] of a [[country]] and its
political precedents exercise upon a [[constitution]]; and i should regard
it as a [[great]] misfortune for [[mankind]] if [[liberty]] were to [[exist]] all over
the [[world]] under the same forms.

but i am of [[opinion]] that if we do not succeed in gradually introducing
democratic [[institutions]] into [[france]], and if we despair of imparting to
the [[citizens]] those ideas [[idea]] and sentiments which first prepare them
for [[freedom]], and afterwards allow them to enjoy it, there will be no
independence at all, either for the middling classes or the nobility,
for the [[poor]] or for the [[rich]], but an [[equal]] [[tyranny]] over all; and i
foresee that if the peaceable [[empire]] of the majority be not founded
amongst us in [[time]], we shall sooner or later arrive at the unlimited
authority of a [[single]] despot.




chapter xviii: future condition of three races [[race]] in the [[united]] states--part i

the [[present]] and probable future condition of the three races [[race]] which
inhabit the territory of the [[united]] states

the principal part of the task which i had imposed upon myself is now
performed. i have shown, as far as i was able, the laws [[law]] and the manners
of the american [[democracy]]. here i might stop; but the reader would
perhaps [[feel]] that i had not satisfied his expectations.

the absolute [[supremacy]] of [[democracy]] is not all that we meet with in
america; the inhabitants of the new [[world]] may be considered from more
than one point of view. in the course of this [[work]] my [[subject]] has often
led me to speak of the indians [[indian]] and the negroes; but i have never been
able to stop in order to show what place these two races [[race]] occupy in the
midst of the democratic [[people]] whom i was engaged in describing. i have
mentioned in what spirit, and according to what laws [[law]], the anglo-american
union was formed; but i could only glance at the dangers which menace
that confederation, whilst it was equally impossible for me to give a
detailed account of its chances [[chance]] of duration, independently of its laws
and manners. when speaking of the [[united]] republican states, i hazarded
no conjectures upon the permanence of republican forms in the new [[world]],
and when making frequent allusion to the commercial activity which
reigns in the union, i was unable to inquire into the future condition
of the americans as a commercial [[people]].

these topics are collaterally connected with my [[subject]] without forming
a part of it; they are american without being democratic; and to portray
democracy has been my principal aim. it was therefore necessary to
postpone these questions [[question]], which i now take up as the proper termination
of my [[work]].

the territory now occupied or claimed by the american union spreads from
the shores of the atlantic to those of the pacific ocean. on the east
and west its limits are those of the continent itself. on the south it
advances nearly to the tropic, and it extends upwards to the icy regions
of the north. the [[human]] beings who are scattered over this space do not
form, as in [[europe]], so many branches of the same stock. three races [[race]],
naturally distinct, and, i might almost say, hostile to each other, are
discoverable amongst them at the first glance. almost insurmountable
barriers had been raised between them by [[education]] and by [[law]], as well
as by their origin and outward characteristics; but [[fortune]] has brought
them together on the same soil, where, although they are mixed, they do
not amalgamate, and each [[race]] fulfils its [[destiny]] apart.

amongst these widely differing families [[family]] of [[men]], the first which attracts
attention, the superior in [[intelligence]], in [[power]] and in enjoyment, is
the [[white]] or [[european]], the [[man]] pre-eminent; and in subordinate grades,
the negro and the [[indian]]. these two unhappy races [[race]] have nothing in
common; neither birth, nor features, nor [[language]], nor habits. their
only resemblance lies [[lie]] in their misfortunes. both of them occupy an
inferior rank in the [[country]] they inhabit; both suffer from [[tyranny]]; and
if their wrongs [[wrong]] are not the same, they originate, at any rate, with the
same authors.

if we reasoned from what passes in the [[world]], we should almost say that
the [[european]] is to the other races [[race]] of [[mankind]], what [[man]] is to the lower
animals;--he makes them subservient to his use; and when he cannot
subdue, he destroys them. oppression has, at one stroke, deprived the
descendants of the africans of almost all the privileges [[privilege]] of [[humanity]].
the negro of the [[united]] states has lost all remembrance of his [[country]];
the [[language]] which his forefathers spoke is never heard around him; he
abjured their [[religion]] and forgot their customs when he ceased to belong
to [[africa]], without acquiring any claim to [[european]] privileges [[privilege]]. but he
remains half way between the two communities [[community]]; sold by the one, repulsed
by the other; finding not a spot in the [[universe]] to call by the name
of [[country]], except the faint image of a [[home]] which the shelter of his
master's roof affords.

the negro has no [[family]]; woman is merely the temporary companion of his
pleasures, and his [[children]] are upon an equality with himself from
the moment of their birth. am i to call it a proof of god's [[mercy]] or
a visitation of his wrath, that [[man]] in [[certain]] states appears to be
insensible to his extreme wretchedness, and almost affects, with a
depraved taste, the cause of his misfortunes? the negro, who is plunged
in this abyss of evils [[evil]], scarcely feels [[feel]] his own calamitous situation.
violence made him a [[slave]], and the habit of servitude gives him the
thoughts and desires [[desire]] of a [[slave]]; he admires his tyrants [[tyrant]] more than he
hates them, and finds his joy and his [[pride]] in the servile imitation of
those who [[oppress]] him: his understanding is degraded to the level of his
soul.

the negro enters upon [[slavery]] as soon as he is born: nay, he may have
been purchased in the womb, and have begun his [[slavery]] before he began
his existence. equally devoid of wants and of enjoyment, and useless to
himself, he learns, with his first notions of existence, that he is the
property of another, who has an interest in preserving his [[life]], and
that the [[care]] of it does not devolve upon himself; even the [[power]] of
thought appears to him a useless gift of providence, and he quietly
enjoys the privileges [[privilege]] of his debasement. if he becomes [[free]],
independence is often [[felt]] by him to be a heavier burden than [[slavery]];
for having learned, in the course of his [[life]], to submit to everything
except [[reason]], he is too much unacquainted with her dictates to obey
them. a thousand new desires [[desire]] beset him, and he is destitute of the
knowledge and energy necessary to resist them: these are masters which
it is necessary to contend with, and he has learnt only to submit and
obey. in short, he sinks to such a depth of wretchedness, that while
servitude brutalizes, [[liberty]] destroys him.

oppression has been no less fatal to the [[indian]] than to the negro [[race]],
but its effects are different. before the arrival of [[white]] [[men]] in the
new [[world]], the inhabitants of north [[america]] lived quietly in their
woods, enduring the vicissitudes and practising the virtues [[virtue]] and vices
common to savage nations. the europeans [[european]], having dispersed the indian
tribes and driven them into the deserts, condemned them to a wandering
life full of inexpressible sufferings.

savage nations are only controlled by [[opinion]] and by custom. when the
north american indians [[indian]] had lost the sentiment of attachment to their
country; when their families [[family]] were dispersed, their traditions obscured,
and the chain of their recollections broken; when all their habits were
changed, and their wants increased beyond measure, [[european]] tyranny
rendered them more disorderly and less civilized than they were before.
the [[moral]] and physical condition of these tribes continually grew
worse, and they became more barbarous as they became more wretched.
nevertheless, the europeans [[european]] have not been able to metamorphose the
character of the indians [[indian]]; and though they have had [[power]] to destroy
them, they have never been able to make them submit to the rules [[rule]] of
civilized [[society]].

the lot of the negro is placed on the extreme limit of servitude, while
that of the [[indian]] lies [[lie]] on the uttermost verge of [[liberty]]; and slavery
does not [[produce]] more fatal effects upon the first, than independence
upon the second. the negro has lost all [[property]] in his own [[person]], and
he cannot dispose of his existence without committing a sort of fraud:
but the savage is his own master as soon as he is able to act; parental
authority is scarcely known to him; he has never bent his will to
that of any of his [[kind]], nor learned the difference between voluntary
obedience and a shameful subjection; and the very name of [[law]] is unknown
to him. to be [[free]], with him, signifies to escape from all the shackles
of [[society]]. as he delights in this barbarous independence, and would
rather perish than [[sacrifice]] the least part of it, [[civilization]] has
little [[power]] over him.

the negro makes a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself
amongst [[men]] who repulse him; he conforms to the tastes of his
oppressors, adopts their opinions [[opinion]], and hopes [[hope]] by imitating them to form a
part of their [[community]]. having been told from infancy that his [[race]] is
naturally inferior to that of the whites, he assents to the proposition
and is ashamed of his own [[nature]]. in each of his features he discovers
a trace of [[slavery]], and, if it were in his [[power]], he would willingly rid
himself of everything that makes him what he is.

the [[indian]], on the contrary, has his [[imagination]] inflated with the
pretended nobility of his origin, and lives [[life]] and dies in the midst of
these dreams [[dream]] of [[pride]]. far from desiring to conform his habits to ours,
he loves [[love]] his savage [[life]] as the distinguishing mark of his [[race]], and he
repels every advance to [[civilization]], less perhaps from the [[hatred]] which
he entertains for it, than from a dread of resembling the europeans [[european]].
*a while he has nothing to oppose to our [[perfection]] in the [[arts]] but
the resources of the desert, to our tactics nothing but undisciplined
courage; whilst our well-digested plans are met by the spontaneous
instincts of savage [[life]], who can wonder if he fails in this unequal
contest?

[footnote a: the native of north [[america]] retains his opinions [[opinion]] and the
most insignificant of his habits with a [[degree]] of tenacity which has
no parallel in [[history]]. for more than two hundred years the wandering
tribes of north [[america]] have had daily intercourse with the whites, and
they have never derived from them either a custom or an [[idea]]. yet the
europeans have exercised a powerful influence over the savages: they
have made them more licentious, but not more [[european]]. in the summer of
1831 i happened to be beyond lake michigan, at a place called green bay,
which serves as the extreme frontier between the [[united]] states and the
indians on the north-western side. here i became acquainted with an
american officer, major h., who, after talking to me at length on the
inflexibility of the [[indian]] [[character]], related the following [[fact]]:--"i
formerly knew a [[young]] [[indian]]," said he, "who had been educated at a
college in new [[england]], where he had greatly distinguished himself, and
had acquired the external appearance of a member of civilized [[society]].
when the [[war]] broke out between ourselves and the english in 1810, i saw
this [[young]] [[man]] again; he was serving in our [[army]], at the head of the
warriors of his tribe, for the indians [[indian]] were admitted amongst the ranks
of the americans, upon condition that they would abstain from their
horrible custom of scalping their victims. on the evening of the battle
of . . ., c. came and sat himself down by the [[fire]] of our bivouac. i
asked him what had been his [[fortune]] that day: he related his exploits;
and growing warm and animated by the recollection of them, he concluded
by suddenly opening the breast of his coat, saying, 'you must not betray
me--see here!' and i actually beheld," said the major, "between his body
and his shirt, the skin and hair of an english head, still dripping with
gore."]

the negro, who earnestly desires [[desire]] to mingle his [[race]] with that of the
european, cannot effect if; while the [[indian]], who might succeed to a
certain extent, disdains to make the attempt. the servility of the one
dooms him to [[slavery]], the [[pride]] of the other to [[death]].

i [[remember]] that while i was travelling through the forests which still
cover the [[state]] of alabama, i arrived one day at the log house of a
pioneer. i did not [[wish]] to penetrate into the dwelling of the american,
but retired to rest myself for a while on the margin of a spring, which
was not far off, in the woods. while i was in this place (which was
in the neighborhood of the creek territory), an [[indian]] woman appeared,
followed by a negress, and holding by the hand a little [[white]] girl of
five or six years old, whom i took to be the [[daughter]] of the pioneer.
a sort of barbarous luxury set off the costume of the [[indian]]; rings
of metal were hanging from her nostrils and ears; her hair, which was
adorned with glass beads, fell loosely upon her shoulders; and i saw
that she was not [[married]], for she still wore that necklace of shells
which the bride always deposits on the nuptial couch. the negress
was clad in squalid [[european]] garments. they all three came and seated
themselves upon the banks of the fountain; and the [[young]] [[indian]], taking
the child in her arms, lavished upon her such fond caresses as mothers
give; while the negress endeavored by various little artifices to
attract the attention of the [[young]] creole.

the child displayed in her slightest gestures a [[consciousness]] of
superiority which formed a [[strange]] contrast with her infantine weakness;
as if she received the attentions of her companions with a sort of
condescension. the negress was seated on the ground before her mistress,
watching her smallest desires [[desire]], and apparently divided between strong
affection for the child and servile [[fear]]; whilst the savage displayed,
in the midst of her tenderness, an air of [[freedom]] and of [[pride]] which was
almost ferocious. i had approached the group, and i contemplated them in
silence; but my curiosity was probably displeasing to the [[indian]] woman,
for she suddenly rose, pushed the child roughly from her, and giving
me an angry look plunged into the thicket. i had often chanced to see
individuals met together in the same place, who belonged to the three
races of [[men]] which [[people]] north [[america]]. i had perceived from many
different results the preponderance of the whites. but in the picture
which i have just been describing there was something peculiarly
touching; a bond of affection here [[united]] the oppressors with the
oppressed, and the effort of [[nature]] to bring them together rendered
still more striking the immense distance placed between them by
prejudice and by [[law]].

the [[present]] and probable future condition of the [[indian]] tribes which
inhabit the territory possessed by the union

gradual disappearance of the native tribes--manner in which it takes
place--miseries accompanying the forced migrations of the indians--the
savages of north [[america]] had only two ways of escaping destruction; war
or civilization--they are no longer able to make war--reasons why they
refused to become civilized when it was in their [[power]], and why they
cannot become so now that they [[desire]] it--instance of the creeks and
cherokees--policy of the particular states towards these indians--policy
of the federal [[government]].

none of the [[indian]] tribes which formerly inhabited the territory of new
england--the naragansetts, the mohicans, the pecots--have any existence
but in the recollection of [[man]]. the lenapes, who received william penn,
a hundred and fifty years ago, upon the banks of the delaware, have
disappeared; and i myself met with the [[last]] of the iroquois, who were
begging alms. the nations i have mentioned formerly covered the country
to the sea-coast; but a traveller at the [[present]] day must penetrate more
than a hundred leagues into the interior of the continent to find an
indian. not only have these wild tribes receded, but they are destroyed;
*b and as they give way or perish, an immense and increasing people
fills their place. there is no instance upon record of so prodigious a
growth, or so rapid a destruction: the manner in which the latter change
takes place is not difficult to describe.

[footnote b: in the thirteen original states there are only 6,273
indians remaining. (see legislative documents, 20th congress, no. 117,
p. 90.) [the decrease in now far greater, and is verging on extinction.
see page 360 of this volume.]]

when the indians [[indian]] were the sole inhabitants of the wilds from whence they
have since been expelled, their wants were few. their arms were of their
own manufacture, their only drink was the water of the brook, and their
clothes consisted of the skins of animals, whose flesh furnished them
with food.

the europeans [[european]] introduced amongst the savages of north [[america]] fire-arms,
ardent spirits, and iron: they taught them to exchange for manufactured
stuffs, the rough garments which had previously satisfied their
untutored simplicity. having acquired new tastes, without the [[arts]] by
which they could be gratified, the indians [[indian]] were obliged to have recourse
to the workmanship of the whites; but in return for their productions
the savage had nothing to offer except the [[rich]] furs which still
abounded in his woods. hence the chase became necessary, not merely to
provide for his subsistence, but in order to procure the only objects
of barter which he could furnish to [[europe]]. *c whilst the wants of the
natives were thus increasing, their resources continued to diminish.

[footnote c: messrs. clarke and cass, in their report to congress on
february 4, 1829, p. 23, expressed themselves thus:--"the [[time]] when
the indians [[indian]] generally could supply themselves with food and clothing,
without any of the articles of civilized [[life]], has long since passed
away. the more remote tribes, beyond the mississippi, who [[live]] where
immense herds of buffalo are yet to be found and who [[follow]] those
animals in their periodical migrations, could more easily than any
others recur to the habits of their [[ancestors]], and [[live]] without the
white [[man]] or any of his manufactures. but the buffalo is constantly
receding. the smaller animals, the bear, the deer, the beaver, the
otter, the muskrat, etc., principally minister to the comfort and
support of the indians [[indian]]; and these cannot be taken without guns,
ammunition, and traps. among the northwestern indians [[indian]] particularly, the
labor of supplying a [[family]] with food is excessive. day after day is
spent by the hunter without [[success]], and during this interval his family
must subsist upon bark or roots, or perish. want and misery are around
them and among them. many [[die]] every winter from actual starvation."

the indians [[indian]] will not [[live]] as europeans [[european]] [[live]], and yet they can neither
subsist without them, nor exactly after the [[fashion]] of their fathers [[father]].
this is demonstrated by a [[fact]] which i likewise give upon official
authority. some indians [[indian]] of a tribe on the banks of lake superior had
killed a [[european]]; the american [[government]] interdicted all traffic
with the tribe to which the guilty parties belonged, until they were
delivered up to [[justice]]. this measure had the [[desired]] effect.]

from the moment when a [[european]] settlement is formed in the neighborhood
of the territory occupied by the indians [[indian]], the beasts of chase take the
alarm. *d thousands of savages, wandering in the forests and destitute
of any fixed dwelling, did not disturb them; but as soon as the
continuous sounds of [[european]] labor are heard in their neighborhood,
they begin to flee away, and retire to the west, where their instinct
teaches them that they will find deserts of immeasurable extent. "the
buffalo is constantly receding," say messrs. clarke and cass in their
report of the year 1829; "a few years since they approached the base
of the alleghany; and a few years hence they may even be rare upon the
immense plains which extend to the base of the rocky mountains." i have
been assured that this effect of the approach of the whites is often
felt at two hundred leagues' distance from their frontier. their
influence is thus exerted over tribes whose name is unknown to them; and
who suffer the evils [[evil]] of usurpation long before they are acquainted with
the authors of their distress. *e

[footnote d: "five years ago," (says volney in his "tableau des
etats-unis," p. 370) "in going from vincennes to kaskaskia, a territory
which now forms part of the [[state]] of illinois, but which at the time
i mention was completely wild (1797), you could not cross a prairie
without seeing herds of from four to five hundred buffaloes. there are
now none remaining; they swam across the mississippi to escape from the
hunters, and more particularly from the bells of the american cows."]

[footnote e: the [[truth]] of what i here advance may be easily proved by
consulting the tabular statement of [[indian]] tribes inhabiting the united
states and their territories. (legislative documents, 20th congress,
no. 117, pp. 90-105.) it is there shown that the tribes in the centre
of [[america]] are rapidly decreasing, although the europeans [[european]] are still at a
considerable distance from them.]

bold adventurers soon penetrate into the [[country]] the indians [[indian]] have
deserted, and when they have advanced about fifteen or twenty
leagues from the extreme frontiers of the whites, they begin to build
habitations for civilized beings in the midst of the wilderness. this
is done without difficulty, as the territory of a hunting-nation is
ill-defined; it is the [[common]] [[property]] of the tribe, and belongs to no
one in particular, so that [[individual]] interests are not concerned in the
protection of any part of it.

a few [[european]] families [[family]], settled in different situations at a
considerable distance from each other, soon drive away the wild animals
which remain between their places of abode. the indians [[indian]], who had
previously lived in a sort of abundance, then find it difficult to
subsist, and still more difficult to procure the articles of barter
which they stand in need of.

to drive away their game is to deprive them of the means of existence,
as effectually as if the fields of our agriculturists were stricken with
barrenness; and they are reduced, like famished wolves, to prowl through
the forsaken woods in quest of prey. their instinctive [[love]] of their
country attaches them to the soil which gave them birth, *f even after
it has ceased to yield anything but misery and [[death]]. at length they
are compelled to acquiesce, and to depart: they [[follow]] the traces of the
elk, the buffalo, and the beaver, and are guided by these wild animals
in the [[choice]] of their future [[country]]. properly speaking, therefore, it
is not the europeans [[european]] who drive away the native inhabitants of [[america]];
it is famine which compels them to recede; a [[happy]] distinction which had
escaped the casuists of former times [[time]], and for which we are indebted to
modern discovery!

[footnote f: "the indians [[indian]]," say messrs. clarke and cass in their report
to congress, p. 15, "are attached to their [[country]] by the same feelings
which bind us to ours; and, besides, there are [[certain]] superstitious
notions connected with the alienation of what the [[great]] spirit gave to
their [[ancestors]], which operate strongly upon the tribes who have made
few or no cessions, but which are gradually weakened as our intercourse
with them is extended. 'we will not sell the spot which contains
the bones of our fathers [[father]],' is almost always the first [[answer]] to a
proposition for a sale."]

it is impossible to conceive the extent of the sufferings which attend
these forced emigrations. they are undertaken by a [[people]] already
exhausted and reduced; and the countries [[country]] to which the newcomers betake
themselves are inhabited by other tribes which receive them with jealous
hostility. [[hunger]] is in the rear; [[war]] awaits them, and misery besets
them on all sides. in the [[hope]] of escaping from such a host of enemies [[enemy]],
they separate, and each [[individual]] endeavors to procure the means
of supporting his existence in solitude and secrecy, living in the
immensity of the desert like an outcast in civilized [[society]]. the social
tie, which distress had long since weakened, is then dissolved; they
have lost their [[country]], and their [[people]] soon desert them: their very
families are obliterated; the names they bore in [[common]] are forgotten,
their [[language]] perishes, and all traces of their origin disappear.
their nation has ceased to [[exist]], except in the recollection of the
antiquaries of [[america]] and a few of the learned of [[europe]].

i should be [[sorry]] to have my reader suppose that i am coloring the
picture too highly; i saw with my own [[eyes]] several of the cases of
misery which i have been describing; and i was the witness of sufferings
which i have not the [[power]] to portray.

at the end of the year 1831, whilst i was on the left bank of the
mississippi at a place named by europeans [[european]], memphis, there arrived a
numerous band of choctaws (or chactas, as they are called by the
french in louisiana). these savages had left their [[country]], and were
endeavoring to gain the [[right]] bank of the mississippi, where they
hoped to find an asylum which had been promised them by the american
government. it was then the middle of winter, and the cold was unusually
severe; the snow had frozen hard upon the ground, and the river was
drifting huge masses of ice. the indians [[indian]] had their families [[family]] with them;
and they brought in their train the wounded and sick, with children
newly born, and old [[men]] upon the verge of [[death]]. they possessed neither
tents nor wagons, but only their arms and some provisions. i saw them
embark to pass the mighty river, and never will that solemn spectacle
fade from my remembrance. no cry, no sob was heard amongst the assembled
crowd; all were silent. their calamities were of ancient date, and they
knew them to be irremediable. the indians [[indian]] had all stepped into the bark
which was to carry them across, but their dogs remained upon the bank.
as soon as these animals perceived that their masters were finally
leaving the shore, they set up a dismal howl, and, plunging all together
into the icy waters of the mississippi, they swam after the boat.

the ejectment of the indians [[indian]] very often takes place at the present
day, in a regular, and, as it were, a legal manner. when the european
population begins to approach the limit of the desert inhabited by a
savage tribe, the [[government]] of the [[united]] states usually dispatches
envoys to them, who assemble the indians [[indian]] in a large plain, and having
first eaten and drunk with them, accost them in the following manner:
"what have you to do in the [[land]] of your fathers [[father]]? before long, you must
dig up their bones in order to [[live]]. in what [[respect]] is the [[country]] you
inhabit [[better]] than another? are there no woods, marshes, or prairies,
except where you dwell? and can you [[live]] nowhere but under your own sun?
beyond those mountains which you see at the horizon, beyond the lake
which bounds your territory on the west, there [[lie]] vast countries [[country]] where
beasts of chase are found in [[great]] abundance; sell your lands [[land]] to us,
and go to [[live]] happily in those solitudes." after holding this [[language]],
they spread before the [[eyes]] of the indians [[indian]] firearms, woollen garments,
kegs of brandy, glass necklaces, bracelets of tinsel, earrings, and
looking-glasses. *g if, when they have beheld all these riches [[rich]], they
still hesitate, it is insinuated that they have not the means of
refusing their required [[consent]], and that the [[government]] itself will not
long have the [[power]] of protecting them in their rights [[right]]. what are they to
do? half convinced, and half compelled, they go to inhabit new deserts,
where the importunate whites will not let them remain ten years in
tranquillity. in this manner do the americans obtain, at a very low
price, whole provinces, which the richest sovereigns [[sovereign]] of [[europe]] could not
purchase. *h

[footnote g: see, in the legislative documents of congress (doc. 117),
the narrative of what takes place on these occasions [[occasion]]. this curious
passage is from the above-mentioned report, made to congress by messrs.
clarke and cass in february, 1829. mr. cass is now the secretary of [[war]].

"the indians [[indian]]," says the report, "reach the treaty-ground [[poor]] and almost
naked. large quantities of goods [[good]] are taken there by the traders, and
are seen and examined by the indians [[indian]]. the [[women]] and [[children]] become
importunate to have their wants supplied, and their influence is
soon exerted to induce a sale. their improvidence is habitual and
unconquerable. the gratification of his immediate wants and desires [[desire]] is
the ruling passion of an [[indian]]. the expectation of future advantages
seldom produces [[produce]] much effect. the [[experience]] of the [[past]] is lost, and
the prospects of the future disregarded. it would be utterly hopeless
to demand a cession of [[land]], unless the means were at hand of gratifying
their immediate wants; and when their condition and circumstances are
fairly considered, it ought not to surprise us that they are so anxious
to relieve themselves."]

[footnote h: on may 19, 1830, mr. edward everett affirmed before the
house of representatives, that the americans had already acquired by
treaty, to the east and west of the mississippi, 230,000,000 of acres.
in 1808 the osages gave up 48,000,000 acres for an annual payment of
$1,000. in 1818 the quapaws yielded up 29,000,000 acres for $4,000.
they reserved for themselves a territory of 1,000,000 acres for a
hunting-ground. a solemn oath was taken that it should be respected: but
before long it was invaded like the rest. mr. bell, in his report of the
committee on [[indian]] affairs, february 24, 1830, has these words:--"to
pay an [[indian]] tribe what their ancient hunting-grounds are worth to
them, after the game is fled or destroyed, as a mode of appropriating
wild lands [[land]] claimed by indians [[indian]], has been found more convenient, and
certainly it is more agreeable to the forms of [[justice]], as well as more
merciful, than to assert the possession of them by the [[sword]]. thus the
practice of buying [[indian]] titles is but the substitute which humanity
and expediency have imposed, in place of the [[sword]], in arriving at the
actual enjoyment of [[property]] claimed by the [[right]] of discovery, and
sanctioned by the [[natural]] superiority allowed to the claims of civilized
communities over those of savage tribes. up to the [[present]] time
so invariable has been the operation of [[certain]] causes, first in
diminishing the value of forest lands [[land]] to the indians [[indian]], and secondly in
disposing them to sell readily, that the plan of buying their [[right]] of
occupancy has never threatened to retard, in any perceptible [[degree]], the
prosperity of any of the states." (legislative documents, 21st congress,
no. 227, p. 6.)]




chapter xviii: future condition of three races--part ii

these are [[great]] evils [[evil]]; and it must be added that they appear to me to
be irremediable. i [[believe]] that the [[indian]] nations of north [[america]] are
doomed to perish; and that whenever the europeans [[european]] shall be established
on the shores of the pacific ocean, that [[race]] of [[men]] will be no more.
*i the indians [[indian]] had only the two alternatives of [[war]] or [[civilization]];
in other words, they must either have destroyed the europeans [[european]] or become
their equals [[equal]].

[footnote i: this seems, indeed, to be the [[opinion]] of almost all
american statesmen. "judging of the future by the [[past]]," says mr.
cass, "we cannot err in anticipating a progressive diminution of their
numbers, and their eventual extinction, unless our border should become
stationary, and they be removed beyond it, or unless some radical change
should take place in the principles [[principle]] of our intercourse with them, which
it is easier to [[hope]] for than to expect."]

at the first settlement of the colonies they might have found it
possible, by uniting their forces [[force]], to deliver themselves from the small
bodies of strangers who landed on their continent. *j they several
times attempted to do it, and were on the point of succeeding; but the
disproportion of their resources, at the [[present]] day, when compared
with those of the whites, is too [[great]] to allow such an enterprise to
be [[thought]] of. nevertheless, there do arise from [[time]] to [[time]] among the
indians [[men]] of penetration, who foresee the final [[destiny]] which awaits
the native [[population]], and who exert themselves to unite all the tribes
in [[common]] hostility to the europeans [[european]]; but their efforts are unavailing.
those tribes which are in the neighborhood of the whites, are too much
weakened to offer an effectual [[resistance]]; whilst the others, giving way
to that childish carelessness of the morrow which characterizes savage
life, wait for the near approach of danger before they prepare to meet
it; some are unable, the others are unwilling, to exert themselves.

[footnote j: amongst other warlike enterprises, there was one of the
wampanaogs, and other confederate tribes, under metacom in 1675, against
the colonists of new [[england]]; the english were also engaged in [[war]] in
virginia in 1622.]

it is easy to foresee that the indians [[indian]] will never conform to
civilization; or that it will be too late, whenever they may be inclined
to make the experiment.

civilization is the result of a long social process which takes place in
the same spot, and is handed down from one [[generation]] to another, each
one profiting by the [[experience]] of the [[last]]. of all nations, those
submit to [[civilization]] with the most difficulty which habitually [[live]] by
the chase. pastoral tribes, indeed, often [[change]] their place of abode;
but they [[follow]] a regular order in their migrations, and often return
again to their old stations, whilst the dwelling of the hunter varies
with that of the animals he pursues.

several attempts have been made to diffuse [[knowledge]] amongst the
indians, without controlling their wandering propensities; by the
jesuits in canada, and by the puritans in new [[england]]; *k but none of
these endeavors were crowned by any lasting [[success]]. [[civilization]] began
in the cabin, but it soon retired to expire in the woods. the great
error of these legislators of the indians [[indian]] was their not understanding
that, in order to succeed in civilizing a [[people]], it is first necessary
to fix it; which cannot be done without inducing it to cultivate the
soil; the indians [[indian]] ought in the first place to have been accustomed
to agriculture. but not only are they destitute of this indispensable
preliminary to [[civilization]], they would even have [[great]] difficulty in
acquiring it. [[men]] who have once abandoned themselves to the restless and
adventurous [[life]] of the hunter, [[feel]] an insurmountable disgust for the
constant and regular labor which tillage requires. we see this proved in
the bosom of our own [[society]]; but it is far more visible among peoples
whose partiality for the chase is a part of their national [[character]].

[footnote k: see the "histoire de la nouvelle [[france]]," by charlevoix,
and the [[work]] entitled "lettres edifiantes."]

independently of this general difficulty, there is another, which
applies peculiarly to the indians [[indian]]; they consider labor not merely as an
evil, but as a disgrace; so that their [[pride]] prevents them from becoming
civilized, as much as their indolence. *l

[footnote l: "in all the tribes," says volney, in his "tableau des
etats-unis," p. 423, "there still exists a [[generation]] of old warriors,
who cannot forbear, when they see their countrymen using the hoe, from
exclaiming against the degradation of ancient manners, and asserting
that the savages owe their decline to these innovations; adding, that
they have only to return to their primitive habits in order to recover
their [[power]] and their [[glory]]."]

there is no [[indian]] so wretched as not to retain under his hut of bark a
lofty [[idea]] of his personal worth; he considers the cares [[care]] of industry
and labor as degrading occupations; he compares the husbandman to the ox
which traces the furrow; and even in our most ingenious handicraft,
he can see nothing but the labor of slaves [[slave]]. not that he is devoid of
admiration for the [[power]] and intellectual greatness of the whites; but
although the result of our efforts surprises him, he contemns the means
by which we obtain it; and while he acknowledges our ascendancy, he
still believes [[belief]] in his superiority. [[war]] and hunting are the only pursuits
which appear to him worthy to be the occupations of a [[man]]. *m the
indian, in the dreary solitude of his woods, cherishes the same ideas [[idea]],
the same opinions [[opinion]] as the [[noble]] of the middle ages [[age]] in his castle, and he
only requires to become a conqueror to complete the resemblance; thus,
however [[strange]] it may seem, it is in the forests of the new [[world]],
and not amongst the europeans [[european]] who [[people]] its coasts, that the ancient
prejudices of [[europe]] are still in existence.


[footnote m: the following description occurs in an official document:
"until a [[young]] [[man]] has been engaged with an [[enemy]], and has performed
some acts of valor, he gains no consideration, but is regarded nearly as
a woman. in their [[great]] war-dances all the warriors in succession
strike the post, as it is called, and recount their exploits. on these
occasions their auditory consists of the kinsmen, [[friends]], and comrades
of the narrator. the profound impression which his discourse produces [[produce]] on
them is manifested by the silent attention it receives, and by the loud
shouts which hail its termination. the [[young]] [[man]] who finds himself
at such a meeting without anything to recount is very unhappy; and
instances have sometimes occurred of [[young]] warriors, whose [[passions]] had
been thus inflamed, quitting the war-dance suddenly, and going off alone
to seek for trophies which they might exhibit, and adventures which they
might be allowed to relate."]

more than once, in the course of this [[work]], i have endeavored to explain
the prodigious influence which the social condition appears to exercise
upon the laws [[law]] and the manners of [[men]]; and i beg to add a few words on
the same [[subject]].

when i perceive the resemblance which exists between the political
institutions of our [[ancestors]], the germans, and of the wandering tribes
of north [[america]]; between the customs described by tacitus, and those of
which i have sometimes been a witness, i cannot [[help]] thinking that the
same cause has brought about the same results in both hemispheres; and
that in the midst of the apparent [[diversity]] of [[human]] affairs, a certain
number of primary facts [[fact]] may be discovered, from which all the others
are derived. in what we usually call the [[german]] [[institutions]], then, i am
inclined only to perceive barbarian habits; and the opinions [[opinion]] of savages
in what we style feudal principles [[principle]].

however strongly the vices [[vice]] and prejudices of the north american indians
may be opposed to their becoming agricultural and civilized, necessity
sometimes obliges them to it. several of the southern nations, and
amongst others the cherokees and the creeks, *n were surrounded by
europeans, who had landed on the shores of the atlantic; and who,
either descending the ohio or proceeding up the mississippi, arrived
simultaneously upon their borders. these tribes have not been driven
from place to place, like their northern brethren [[brother]]; but they have been
gradually enclosed within narrow limits, like the game within the
thicket, before the huntsmen plunge into the interior. the indians
who were thus placed between [[civilization]] and [[death]], found themselves
obliged to [[live]] by ignominious labor like the whites. they took to
agriculture, and without entirely forsaking their old habits or manners,
sacrificed only as much as was necessary to their existence.

[footnote n: these nations are now swallowed up in the states of
georgia, tennessee, alabama, and mississippi. there were formerly in the
south four [[great]] nations (remnants of which still exist), the choctaws,
the chickasaws, the creeks, and the cherokees. the remnants of these
four nations amounted, in 1830, to about 75,000 individuals [[individual]]. it is
computed that there are now remaining in the territory occupied
or claimed by the anglo-american union about 300,000 indians [[indian]]. (see
proceedings of the [[indian]] board in the [[city]] of new york.) the official
documents supplied to congress make the number amount to 313,130. the
reader who is [[curious]] to [[know]] the names and numerical [[strength]] of all
the tribes which inhabit the anglo-american territory should consult the
documents i refer to. (legislative documents, 20th congress, no.
117, pp. 90-105.) [in the census of 1870 it is stated that the indian
population of the [[united]] states is only 25,731, of whom 7,241 are in
california.]]

the cherokees went further; they created a written [[language]]; established
a permanent form of [[government]]; and as everything proceeds rapidly
in the new [[world]], before they had all of them clothes, they set up a
newspaper. *o

[footnote o: i brought back with me to [[france]] one or two copies of this
singular publication.]

the [[growth]] of [[european]] habits has been remarkably accelerated among
these indians [[indian]] by the mixed [[race]] which has sprung up. *p deriving
intelligence from their father's side, without entirely losing the
savage customs of the [[mother]], the half-blood forms the [[natural]] link
between [[civilization]] and barbarism. wherever this [[race]] has multiplied
the savage [[state]] has become modified, and a [[great]] [[change]] has taken place
in the manners of the [[people]]. *q

[footnote p: see in the report of the committee on [[indian]] affairs, 21st
congress, no. 227, p. 23, the reasons [[reason]] for the multiplication of indians
of mixed [[blood]] among the cherokees. the principal cause dates from the
war of independence. many anglo-americans of georgia, having taken the
side of [[england]], were obliged to retreat among the indians [[indian]], where they
married.]

[footnote q: unhappily the mixed [[race]] has been less numerous and less
influential in north [[america]] than in any other [[country]]. the american
continent was peopled by two [[great]] nations of [[europe]], the french and
the english. the former were not slow in connecting themselves with the
daughters of the natives, but there was an unfortunate affinity between
the [[indian]] [[character]] and their own: instead of giving the tastes and
habits of civilized [[life]] to the savages, the french too often grew
passionately fond of the [[state]] of wild [[freedom]] they found them in. they
became the most dangerous of the inhabitants of the desert, and won the
friendship of the [[indian]] by exaggerating his vices [[vice]] and his virtues [[virtue]]. m.
de senonville, the governor of canada, wrote thus to louis xiv in 1685:
"it has long been believed that in order to civilize the savages we
ought to draw them nearer to us. but there is every [[reason]] to suppose we
have been mistaken. those which have been brought into contact with us
have not become french, and the french who have lived among them are
changed into savages, affecting to dress and [[live]] like them." ("history
of new [[france]]," by charlevoix, vol. ii., p. 345.) the englishman, on the
contrary, continuing obstinately attached to the customs and the most
insignificant habits of his forefathers, has remained in the midst of
the american solitudes just what he was in the bosom of [[european]] cities [[city]];
he would not allow of any communication with savages whom he despised,
and avoided with [[care]] the union of his [[race]] with theirs. thus while the
french exercised no salutary influence over the indians [[indian]], the english
have always remained alien from them.]

the [[success]] of the cherokees proves that the indians [[indian]] are capable of
civilization, but it does not prove that they will succeed in it. this
difficulty which the indians [[indian]] find in submitting to [[civilization]] proceeds
from the influence of a general cause, which it is almost impossible
for them to escape. an attentive survey of [[history]] demonstrates that,
in general, barbarous nations have raised themselves to [[civilization]] by
degrees, and by their own efforts. whenever they derive [[knowledge]] from a
foreign [[people]], they stood towards it in the relation of conquerors, and
not of a conquered nation. when the conquered nation is enlightened, and
the conquerors are half savage, as in the case of the [[invasion]] of rome
by the northern nations or that of [[china]] by the mongols, the power
which [[victory]] bestows upon the barbarian is sufficient to keep up his
importance among civilized [[men]], and permit him to rank as their [[equal]],
until he becomes their rival: the one has might on his side, the other
has [[intelligence]]; the former admires the [[knowledge]] and the [[arts]] of the
conquered, the latter envies the [[power]] of the conquerors. the barbarians
at length admit civilized [[man]] into their palaces, and he in turn opens
his schools to the barbarians. but when the side on which the physical
force lies [[lie]], also possesses an intellectual preponderance, the conquered
party seldom become civilized; it retreats, or is destroyed. it may
therefore be said, in a general way, that savages go forth in arms to
seek [[knowledge]], but that they do not receive it when it comes to them.

if the [[indian]] tribes which now inhabit the [[heart]] of the continent could
summon up energy enough to attempt to civilize themselves, they might
possibly succeed. superior already to the barbarous nations which
surround them, they would gradually gain [[strength]] and [[experience]], and
when the europeans [[european]] should appear upon their borders, they would be in a
state, if not to maintain their independence, at least to assert their
right to the soil, and to incorporate themselves with the conquerors.
but it is the misfortune of indians [[indian]] to be brought into contact with a
civilized [[people]], which is also (it must be owned) the most avaricious
nation on the globe, whilst they are still semi-barbarian: to find
despots in their instructors, and to receive [[knowledge]] from the hand
of oppression. living in the [[freedom]] of the woods, the north american
indian was destitute, but he had no feeling of inferiority towards
anyone; as soon, however, as he desires [[desire]] to penetrate into the social
scale of the whites, he takes the lowest rank in [[society]], for he enters,
ignorant and [[poor]], within the pale of [[science]] and [[wealth]]. after having
led a [[life]] of agitation, beset with evils [[evil]] and dangers, but at the
same [[time]] filled with proud emotions, *r he is obliged to submit to
a wearisome, obscure, and degraded [[state]]; and to gain the bread which
nourishes him by hard and ignoble labor; such are in his [[eyes]] the only
results of which [[civilization]] can boast: and even this much he is not
sure to obtain.

[footnote r: there is in the adventurous [[life]] of the hunter a certain
irresistible charm, which seizes the [[heart]] of [[man]] and carries him away
in spite of [[reason]] and [[experience]]. this is plainly shown by the memoirs
of tanner. tanner is a [[european]] who was carried away at the [[age]] of six
by the indians [[indian]], and has remained thirty years with them in the woods.
nothing can be conceived more appalling that the miseries which he
describes. he tells us of tribes without a [[chief]], families [[family]] without
a nation to call their own, [[men]] in a [[state]] of isolation, wrecks of
powerful tribes wandering at random amid the ice and snow and desolate
solitudes of canada. [[hunger]] and cold pursue them; every day their life
is in jeopardy. amongst these [[men]], manners have lost their [[empire]],
traditions are without [[power]]. they become more and more savage. tanner
shared in all these miseries; he was aware of his [[european]] origin; he
was not kept away from the whites by [[force]]; on the contrary, he came
every year to [[trade]] with them, entered their dwellings, and witnessed
their enjoyments; he knew that whenever he chose to return to civilized
life he was perfectly able to do so--and he remained thirty years in the
deserts. when he came into civilized [[society]] he declared that the rude
existence which he described, had a secret charm for him which he
was unable to define: he returned to it again and again: at length he
abandoned it with poignant regret; and when he was at length fixed among
the whites, several of his [[children]] refused to share his tranquil and
easy situation. i saw tanner myself at the lower end of lake superior;
he seemed to me to be more like a savage than a civilized being. his
book is written without either taste or order; but he gives, even
unconsciously, a lively picture of the prejudices, the [[passions]], the
vices, and, above all, of the destitution in which he lived.]

when the indians [[indian]] undertake to imitate their [[european]] neighbors, and to
till the [[earth]] like the settlers, they are immediately exposed to a
very formidable competition. the [[white]] [[man]] is skilled in the craft of
agriculture; the [[indian]] is a rough beginner in an art [[arts]] with which he is
unacquainted. the former reaps abundant crops without difficulty, the
latter meets with a thousand obstacles in raising the fruits of the
earth.

the [[european]] is placed amongst a [[population]] whose wants he knows [[know]] and
partakes. the savage is isolated in the midst of a hostile [[people]], with
whose manners, [[language]], and laws [[law]] he is imperfectly acquainted, but
without whose assistance he cannot [[live]]. he can only procure the
materials of comfort by bartering his commodities against the goods
of the [[european]], for the assistance of his countrymen is wholly
insufficient to supply his wants. when the [[indian]] wishes [[wish]] to sell the
produce of his labor, he cannot always meet with a purchaser, whilst the
european readily finds a market; and the former can only [[produce]] at a
considerable cost that which the latter vends at a very low rate. thus
the [[indian]] has no sooner escaped those evils [[evil]] to which barbarous nations
are exposed, than he is subjected to the still greater miseries of
civilized communities [[community]]; and he finds is scarcely less difficult to live
in the midst of our abundance, than in the depth of his own wilderness.

he has not yet lost the habits of his erratic [[life]]; the traditions of
his fathers [[father]] and his passion for the chase are still alive within him.
the wild enjoyments which formerly animated him in the woods, painfully
excite his troubled [[imagination]]; and his former privations appear to
be less keen, his former perils less appalling. he contrasts the
independence which he possessed amongst his equals [[equal]] with the servile
position which he occupies in civilized [[society]]. on the other hand,
the solitudes which were so long his [[free]] [[home]] are still at hand; a few
hours' march will bring him back to them once more. the whites offer him
a sum, which seems to him to be considerable, for the ground which he
has begun to clear. this [[money]] of the europeans [[european]] may possibly furnish him
with the means of a [[happy]] and peaceful subsistence in remoter regions;
and he quits the plough, resumes his native arms, and returns to the
wilderness forever. *s the condition of the creeks and cherokees, to
which i have already alluded, sufficiently corroborates the [[truth]] of
this deplorable picture.

[footnote s: the destructive influence of highly civilized nations
upon others which are less so, has been exemplified by the europeans
themselves. about a century ago the french founded the town of vincennes
up on the wabash, in the middle of the desert; and they lived there
in [[great]] plenty until the arrival of the american settlers, who first
ruined the previous inhabitants by their competition, and afterwards
purchased their lands [[land]] at a very low rate. at the [[time]] when m. de volney,
from whom i borrow these details, passed through vincennes, the number
of the french was reduced to a hundred individuals [[individual]], most of whom were
about to pass over to louisiana or to canada. these french settlers were
worthy [[people]], but idle and uninstructed: they had contracted many of
the habits of savages. the americans, who were perhaps their inferiors,
in a [[moral]] point of view, were immeasurably superior to them in
intelligence: they were industrious, well informed, [[rich]], and accustomed
to govern their own [[community]].

i myself saw in canada, where the intellectual difference between the
two races [[race]] is less striking, that the english are the masters of commerce
and manufacture in the canadian [[country]], that they spread on all sides,
and confine the french within limits which scarcely suffice to contain
them. in like manner, in louisiana, almost all activity in commerce and
manufacture centres in the hands of the anglo-americans.


but the case of texas is still more striking: the [[state]] of texas is a
part of mexico, and lies [[lie]] upon the frontier between that [[country]] and the
united states. in the course of the [[last]] few years the anglo-americans
have penetrated into this province, which is still thinly peopled; they
purchase [[land]], they [[produce]] the commodities of the [[country]], and supplant
the original [[population]]. it may easily be foreseen that if mexico takes
no steps to check this [[change]], the province of texas will very shortly
cease to belong to that [[government]].

if the different degrees--comparatively so slight--which exist
in [[european]] [[civilization]] [[produce]] results of such magnitude, the
consequences which must ensue from the collision of the most perfect
european [[civilization]] with [[indian]] savages may readily be conceived.]

the indians [[indian]], in the little which they have done, have unquestionably
displayed as much [[natural]] genius as the peoples [[people]] of [[europe]] in their most
important designs; but nations as well as [[men]] require [[time]] to learn,
whatever may be their [[intelligence]] and their zeal. whilst the savages
were engaged in the [[work]] of [[civilization]], the europeans [[european]] continued to
surround them on every side, and to confine them within narrower limits;
the two races [[race]] gradually met, and they are now in immediate juxtaposition
to each other. the [[indian]] is already superior to his barbarous parent,
but he is still very far below his [[white]] neighbor. with their resources
and acquired [[knowledge]], the europeans [[european]] soon appropriated to themselves
most of the advantages which the natives might have derived from the
possession of the soil; they have settled in the [[country]], they have
purchased [[land]] at a very low rate or have occupied it by [[force]], and the
indians have been ruined by a competition which they had not the means
of resisting. they were isolated in their own [[country]], and their race
only constituted a colony of troublesome aliens in the midst of a
numerous and domineering [[people]]. *t

[footnote t: see in the legislative documents (21st congress, no. 89)
instances of excesses of every [[kind]] committed by the whites upon the
territory of the indians [[indian]], either in taking possession of a part of their
lands, until compelled to retire by the [[troops]] of congress, or carrying
off their cattle, burning their houses, cutting down their corn, and
doing [[violence]] to their persons [[person]]. it appears, nevertheless, from all
these documents that the claims of the natives are constantly
protected by the [[government]] from the [[abuse]] of [[force]]. the union has a
representative agent continually employed to reside among the indians [[indian]];
and the report of the cherokee agent, which is among the documents
i have referred to, is almost always favorable to the indians [[indian]]. "the
intrusion of whites," he says, "upon the lands [[land]] of the cherokees would
cause ruin to the [[poor]], helpless, and inoffensive inhabitants." and he
further remarks upon the attempt of the [[state]] of georgia to establish
a division line for the [[purpose]] of limiting the boundaries of the
cherokees, that the line drawn having been made by the whites, and
entirely upon ex parte evidence of their several rights [[right]], was of no
validity whatever.]


washington said in one of his messages to congress, "we are more
enlightened and more powerful than the [[indian]] nations, we are therefore
bound in [[honor]] to treat them with [[kindness]] and even with generosity."
but this [[virtuous]] and high-minded policy has not been followed. the
rapacity of the settlers is usually backed by the [[tyranny]] of the
government. although the cherokees and the creeks are established
upon the territory which they inhabited before the settlement of the
europeans, and although the americans have frequently treated with them
as with [[foreign]] nations, the surrounding states have not consented to
acknowledge them as independent peoples [[people]], and attempts have been made to
subject these [[children]] of the woods to anglo-american magistrates, laws [[law]],
and customs. *u destitution had driven these unfortunate indians [[indian]] to
civilization, and oppression now drives them back to their former
condition: many of them abandon the soil which they had begun to clear,
and return to their savage course of [[life]].

[footnote u: in 1829 the [[state]] of alabama divided the creek territory
into counties, and subjected the [[indian]] [[population]] to the [[power]] of
european magistrates.




chapter xviii: future condition of three races--part iii

in 1830 the [[state]] of mississippi assimilated the choctaws and chickasaws
to the [[white]] [[population]], and declared that any of them that should take
the title of [[chief]] would be punished by a fine of $1,000 and a year's
imprisonment. when these laws [[law]] were enforced upon the choctaws, who
inhabited that district, the tribe assembled, their [[chief]] communicated
to them the intentions of the whites, and [[read]] to them some of the laws
to which it was intended that they should submit; and they unanimously
declared that it was [[better]] at once to retreat again into the wilds.]

if we consider the [[tyrannical]] measures which have been adopted by the
legislatures of the southern states, the conduct of their governors, and
the decrees of their courts of [[justice]], we shall be convinced that the
entire expulsion of the indians [[indian]] is the final result to which the efforts
of their policy are directed. the americans of that part of the union
look with [[jealousy]] upon the aborigines, *v they are aware that these
tribes have not yet lost the traditions of savage [[life]], and before
civilization has permanently fixed them to the soil, it is intended
to [[force]] them to recede by reducing them to despair. the creeks and
cherokees, [[oppressed]] by the several states, have appealed to the central
government, which is by no means insensible to their misfortunes, and
is sincerely desirous of saving the remnant of the natives, and of
maintaining them in the [[free]] possession of that territory, which
the union is pledged to [[respect]]. *w but the several states oppose
so formidable a [[resistance]] to the execution of this design, that the
government is obliged to [[consent]] to the extirpation of a few barbarous
tribes in order not to endanger the safety of the american union.

[footnote v: the georgians, who are so much annoyed by the proximity of
the indians [[indian]], inhabit a territory which does not at [[present]] contain
more than seven inhabitants to the square mile. in [[france]] there are one
hundred and sixty-two inhabitants to the same extent of [[country]].]

[footnote w: in 1818 congress appointed commissioners to visit the
arkansas territory, accompanied by a deputation of creeks, choctaws, and
chickasaws. this expedition was commanded by messrs. kennerly,
m'coy, wash hood, and john bell. see the different reports of the
commissioners, and their journal, in the documents of congress, no. 87,
house of representatives.]

but the federal [[government]], which is not able to [[protect]] the indians [[indian]],
would fain mitigate the hardships of their lot; and, with this
intention, proposals have been made to transport them into more remote
regions at the [[public]] cost.

between the thirty-third and thirty-seventh degrees [[degree]] of north latitude,
a vast tract of [[country]] lies [[lie]], which has taken the name of arkansas, from
the principal river that waters its extent. it is bounded on the
one side by the confines of mexico, on the other by the mississippi.
numberless streams cross it in every direction; the [[climate]] is mild, and
the soil productive, but it is only inhabited by a few wandering hordes
of savages. the [[government]] of the union wishes [[wish]] to transport the broken
remnants of the indigenous [[population]] of the south to the portion of
this [[country]] which is nearest to mexico, and at a [[great]] distance from
the american settlements.

we were assured, towards the end of the year 1831, that 10,000
indians had already gone down to the shores of the arkansas; and fresh
detachments were constantly following them; but congress has been unable
to excite a unanimous determination in those whom it is disposed to
protect. some, indeed, are willing to quit the seat of oppression, but
the most enlightened members of the [[community]] refuse to abandon their
recent dwellings and their springing crops; they are of [[opinion]] that the
work of [[civilization]], once interrupted, will never be resumed; they fear
that those domestic habits which have been so recently contracted, may
be irrevocably lost in the midst of a [[country]] which is still barbarous,
and where nothing is prepared for the subsistence of an agricultural
people; they [[know]] that their entrance into those wilds will be opposed
by inimical hordes, and that they have lost the energy of barbarians,
without acquiring the resources of [[civilization]] to resist their attacks.
moreover, the indians [[indian]] readily discover that the settlement which is
proposed to them is merely a temporary expedient. who can assure them
that they will at length be allowed to dwell in [[peace]] in their new
retreat? the [[united]] states pledge themselves to the observance of the
obligation; but the territory which they at [[present]] occupy was formerly
secured to them by the most solemn oaths of anglo-american [[faith]]. *x
the american [[government]] does not indeed rob them of their lands [[land]], but it
allows perpetual incursions to be made on them. in a few years the same
white [[population]] which now flocks around them, will track them to the
solitudes of the arkansas; they will then be exposed to the same evils
without the same remedies, and as the limits of the [[earth]] will at last
fail them, their only refuge is the grave.

[footnote x: the fifth article of the treaty made with the creeks in
august, 1790, is in the following words:--"the [[united]] states solemnly
guarantee to the creek nation all their [[land]] within the limits of the
united states."

the seventh article of the treaty concluded in 1791 with the cherokees
says:--"the [[united]] states solemnly guarantee to the cherokee nation all
their lands [[land]] not hereby ceded." the following article declared that if
any citizen of the [[united]] states or other settler not of the [[indian]] race
should establish himself upon the territory of the cherokees, the united
states would withdraw their protection from that [[individual]], and give
him up to be punished as the cherokee nation should [[think]] fit.]

the union treats the indians [[indian]] with less cupidity and rigor than the
policy of the several states, but the two governments [[government]] are alike
destitute of [[good]] [[faith]]. the states extend what they are pleased to term
the benefits of their laws [[law]] to the indians [[indian]], with a [[belief]] that the
tribes will recede rather than submit; and the central [[government]], which
promises a permanent refuge to these unhappy beings is well aware of its
inability to secure it to them. *y

[footnote y: this does not prevent them from promising in the most
solemn manner to do so. see the letter of the president addressed to the
creek indians [[indian]], march 23, 1829 (proceedings of the [[indian]] board, in the
city of new york, p. 5): "beyond the [[great]] river mississippi, where a
part of your nation has gone, your [[father]] has provided a [[country]] large
enough for all of you, and he advises you to remove to it. there your
white brothers [[brother]] will not trouble you; they will have no claim to the
land, and you can [[live]] upon it, you and all your [[children]], as long as
the grass grows, or the water runs, in [[peace]] and plenty. it will be
yours forever."

the secretary of [[war]], in a letter written to the cherokees, april 18,
1829, (see the same [[work]], p. 6), declares to them that they cannot
expect to retain possession of the lands [[land]] at that [[time]] occupied by them,
but gives them the most positive assurance of uninterrupted [[peace]] if
they would remove beyond the mississippi: as if the [[power]] which
could not grant them protection then, would be able to afford it them
hereafter!]

thus the [[tyranny]] of the states obliges the savages to retire, the union,
by its promises and resources, facilitates their retreat; and these
measures tend to precisely the same end. *z "by the will of our father
in [[heaven]], the governor of the whole [[world]]," said the cherokees in their
petition to congress, *a "the red [[man]] of [[america]] has become small, and
the [[white]] [[man]] [[great]] and renowned. when the [[ancestors]] of the [[people]] of
these [[united]] states first came to the shores of [[america]] they found the
red [[man]] [[strong]]: though he was ignorant and savage, yet he received them
kindly, and gave them dry [[land]] to rest their weary feet. they met in
peace, and shook hands in token of [[friendship]]. whatever the [[white]] man
wanted and [[asked]] of the [[indian]], the latter willingly gave. at that time
the [[indian]] was the [[lord]], and the [[white]] [[man]] the suppliant. but now the
scene has changed. the [[strength]] of the red [[man]] has become weakness. as
his neighbors increased in numbers his [[power]] became less and less,
and now, of the many and powerful tribes who once covered these united
states, only a few are to be seen--a few whom a sweeping pestilence has
left. the northern tribes, who were once so numerous and powerful, are
now nearly extinct. thus it has happened to the red [[man]] of [[america]].
shall we, who are remnants, share the same [[fate]]?"

[footnote z: to obtain a [[correct]] [[idea]] of the policy pursued by the
several states and the union with [[respect]] to the indians [[indian]], it is
necessary to consult, 1st, "the laws [[law]] of the colonial and state
governments relating to the [[indian]] inhabitants." (see the legislative
documents, 21st congress, no. 319.) 2d, the laws [[law]] of the union on the
same [[subject]], and especially that of march 30, 1802. (see story's "laws
of the [[united]] states.") 3d, the report of mr. cass, secretary of [[war]],
relative to [[indian]] affairs, november 29, 1823.]

[footnote a: december 18, 1829.]

"the [[land]] on which we stand we have received as an [[inheritance]] from
our fathers [[father]], who possessed it from [[time]] immemorial, as a gift from our
common [[father]] in [[heaven]]. they bequeathed it to us as their [[children]], and
we have sacredly kept it, as containing the remains of our beloved [[men]].
this [[right]] of [[inheritance]] we have never ceded nor ever forfeited. permit
us to ask what [[better]] [[right]] can the [[people]] have to a [[country]] than the
right of [[inheritance]] and immemorial peaceable possession? we [[know]] it is
said of late by the [[state]] of georgia and by the executive of the united
states, that we have forfeited this [[right]]; but we [[think]] this is said
gratuitously. at what [[time]] have we made the forfeit? what [[great]] crime
have we committed, whereby we must forever be divested of our country
and rights [[right]]? was it when we were hostile to the [[united]] states, and
took part with the [[king]] of [[great]] [[britain]], during the struggle for
independence? if so, why was not this forfeiture declared in the first
treaty of [[peace]] between the [[united]] states and our beloved [[men]]? why
was not such an article as the following inserted in the treaty:--'the
united states give [[peace]] to the cherokees, but, for the part they took
in the late [[war]], declare them to be but tenants at will, to be removed
when the convenience of the states, within whose chartered limits they
live, shall require it'? that was the proper [[time]] to assume such a
possession. but it was not [[thought]] of, nor would our forefathers have
agreed to any treaty whose tendency was to deprive them of their rights
and their [[country]]."

such is the [[language]] of the indians [[indian]]: their assertions are true, their
forebodings inevitable. from whichever side we consider the destinies
of the aborigines of north [[america]], their calamities appear to be
irremediable: if they continue barbarous, they are forced to retire; if
they attempt to civilize their manners, the contact of a more civilized
community subjects [[subject]] them to oppression and destitution. they perish if
they continue to wander from waste to waste, and if they attempt to
settle they still must perish; the assistance of europeans [[european]] is necessary
to instruct them, but the approach of europeans [[european]] corrupts and repels them
into savage [[life]]; they refuse to [[change]] their habits as long as their
solitudes are their own, and it is too late to [[change]] them when they are
constrained to submit.

the spaniards pursued the indians [[indian]] with bloodhounds, like wild beasts;
they sacked the new [[world]] with no more temper or compassion than a city
taken by storm; but destruction must cease, and frenzy be stayed; the
remnant of the [[indian]] [[population]] which had escaped the massacre mixed
with its conquerors, and adopted in the end their [[religion]] and their
manners. *b the conduct of the americans of the [[united]] states towards
the aborigines is characterized, on the other hand, by a singular
attachment to the formalities of [[law]]. provided that the indians [[indian]] retain
their barbarous condition, the americans take no part in their affairs;
they treat them as independent nations, and do not possess themselves
of their hunting grounds without a treaty of purchase; and if an indian
nation happens to be so encroached upon as to be unable to subsist upon
its territory, they afford it brotherly assistance in transporting it to
a grave sufficiently remote from the [[land]] of its fathers [[father]].

[footnote b: the [[honor]] of this result is, however, by no means due to
the spaniards. if the [[indian]] tribes had not been tillers of the ground
at the [[time]] of the arrival of the europeans [[european]], they would unquestionably
have been destroyed in south as well as in north [[america]].]

the spaniards were unable to exterminate the [[indian]] [[race]] by those
unparalleled atrocities which brand them with indelible shame, nor
did they even succeed in wholly depriving it of its rights [[right]]; but the
americans of the [[united]] states have accomplished this twofold purpose
with singular felicity; tranquilly, legally, philanthropically, without
shedding [[blood]], and without violating a [[single]] [[great]] [[principle]] of
morality in the [[eyes]] of the [[world]]. *c it is impossible to [[destroy]] men
with more [[respect]] for the laws [[law]] of [[humanity]].

[footnote c: see, amongst other documents, the report made by mr. bell
in the name of the committee on [[indian]] affairs, february 24, 1830, in
which is most logically established and most learnedly proved, that "the
fundamental [[principle]] that the indians [[indian]] had no [[right]] by [[virtue]] of
their ancient possession either of will or sovereignty, has never been
abandoned either expressly or by implication." in perusing this report,
which is evidently drawn up by an experienced hand, one is astonished
at the facility with which the author gets rid of all arguments founded
upon [[reason]] and [[natural]] [[right]], which he designates as abstract and
theoretical principles [[principle]]. the more i contemplate the difference between
civilized and uncivilized [[man]] with regard to the principles [[principle]] of [[justice]],
the more i observe that the former contests the [[justice]] of those rights
which the latter simply violates.]

[i leave this [[chapter]] wholly unchanged, for it has always appeared to me
to be one of the most eloquent and touching parts of this [[book]]. but it
has ceased to be prophetic; the destruction of the [[indian]] [[race]] in the
united states is already consummated. in 1870 there remained but 25,731
indians in the whole territory of the union, and of these by far the
largest part [[exist]] in california, michigan, wisconsin, dakota, and new
mexico and nevada. in new [[england]], pennsylvania, and new york the race
is extinct; and the predictions of m. de tocqueville are fulfilled.
--translator's note.]

situation of the black [[population]] in the [[united]] states, and dangers with
which its presence threatens the whites

why it is more difficult to abolish [[slavery]], and to efface all vestiges
of it amongst the moderns than it was amongst the ancients--in the
united states the prejudices of the whites against the blacks seem to
increase in proportion as [[slavery]] is abolished--situation of the
negroes in the northern and southern states--why the americans
abolish slavery--servitude, which debases the [[slave]], impoverishes the
master--contrast between the left and the [[right]] bank of the ohio--to
what attributable--the black [[race]], as well as [[slavery]], recedes towards
the south--explanation of this fact--difficulties attendant upon
the abolition of [[slavery]] in the south--dangers to come--general
anxiety--foundation of a black colony in africa--why the americans of
the south increase the hardships of [[slavery]], whilst they are distressed
at its continuance.

the indians [[indian]] will perish in the same isolated condition in which they
have lived; but the [[destiny]] of the negroes is in some measure interwoven
with that of the europeans [[european]]. these two races [[race]] are attached to each other
without intermingling, and they are alike unable entirely to separate
or to combine. the most formidable of all the ills which threaten
the future existence of the union arises from the presence of a black
population upon its territory; and in contemplating the cause of the
present embarrassments or of the future dangers of the [[united]] states,
the observer is invariably [[led]] to consider this as a primary [[fact]].

the permanent evils [[evil]] to which [[mankind]] is subjected are usually produced
by the vehement or the increasing efforts of [[men]]; but there is one
calamity which penetrated furtively into the [[world]], and which was at
first scarcely distinguishable amidst the ordinary abuses [[abuse]] of [[power]]; it
originated with an [[individual]] whose name [[history]] has not preserved; it
was wafted like some accursed germ upon a portion of the soil, but it
afterwards nurtured itself, grew without effort, and spreads naturally
with the [[society]] to which it belongs. i need scarcely add that this
calamity is [[slavery]]. [[christianity]] suppressed [[slavery]], but the christians
of the sixteenth century re-established it--as an exception, indeed, to
their social [[system]], and restricted to one of the races [[race]] of [[mankind]]; but
the wound thus inflicted upon [[humanity]], though less extensive, was at
the same [[time]] rendered far more difficult of cure.

it is important to make an accurate distinction between [[slavery]] itself
and its consequences. the immediate evils [[evil]] which are produced by slavery
were very nearly the same in antiquity as they are amongst the moderns;
but the consequences of these evils [[evil]] were different. the [[slave]], amongst
the ancients, belonged to the same [[race]] as his master, and he was often
the superior of the two in [[education]] *d and instruction. [[freedom]] was the
only distinction between them; and when [[freedom]] was conferred they were
easily confounded together. the ancients, then, had a very simple
means of avoiding [[slavery]] and its [[evil]] consequences, which was that of
affranchisement; and they succeeded as soon as they adopted this
measure generally. not but, in ancient states, the vestiges of servitude
subsisted for some [[time]] after servitude itself was abolished. there is a
natural prejudice which prompts [[men]] to despise whomsoever has been their
inferior long after he is become their [[equal]]; and the real inequality
which is produced by [[fortune]] or by [[law]] is always succeeded by an
imaginary inequality which is implanted in the manners of the [[people]].
nevertheless, this secondary consequence of [[slavery]] was limited to a
certain term amongst the ancients, for the freedman bore so entire
a resemblance to those born [[free]], that it soon became impossible to
distinguish him from amongst them.

[footnote d: it is well known that several of the most distinguished
authors of antiquity, and amongst them aesop and terence, were, or had
been slaves [[slave]]. slaves [[slave]] were not always taken from barbarous nations, and
the chances [[chance]] of [[war]] reduced highly civilized [[men]] to servitude.]

the [[greatest]] difficulty in antiquity was that of altering the [[law]];
amongst the moderns it is that of altering the manners; and, as far as
we are concerned, the real obstacles begin where those of the ancients
left off. this arises from the circumstance that, amongst the moderns,
the abstract and transient [[fact]] of [[slavery]] is fatally [[united]] to the
physical and permanent [[fact]] of color. the tradition of [[slavery]] dishonors
the [[race]], and the peculiarity of the [[race]] perpetuates the tradition of
slavery. no african has ever voluntarily emigrated to the shores of the
new [[world]]; whence it must be inferred, that all the blacks who are now
to be found in that hemisphere are either slaves [[slave]] or freedmen. thus the
negro transmits the eternal mark of his ignominy to all his descendants;
and although the [[law]] may abolish [[slavery]], [[god]] alone can obliterate the
traces of its existence.

the [[modern]] [[slave]] differs from his master not only in his condition,
but in his origin. you may set the negro [[free]], but you cannot make him
otherwise than an alien to the [[european]]. nor is this all; we scarcely
acknowledge the [[common]] features of [[mankind]] in this child of debasement
whom [[slavery]] has brought amongst us. his physiognomy is to our eyes
hideous, his understanding [[weak]], his tastes low; and we are almost
inclined to look upon him as a being intermediate between [[man]] and the
brutes. *e the moderns, then, after they have abolished [[slavery]], have
three prejudices to contend against, which are less easy to attack and
far less easy to conquer than the mere [[fact]] of servitude: the prejudice
of the master, the prejudice of the [[race]], and the prejudice of color.

[footnote e: to induce the whites to abandon the [[opinion]] they have
conceived of the [[moral]] and intellectual inferiority of their former
slaves, the negroes must [[change]]; but as long as this [[opinion]] subsists,
to [[change]] is impossible.]

it is difficult for us, who have had the [[good]] [[fortune]] to be born amongst
men like ourselves by [[nature]], and [[equal]] to ourselves by [[law]], to conceive
the irreconcilable differences which separate the negro from the
european in [[america]]. but we may derive some faint notion of them from
analogy. [[france]] was formerly a [[country]] in which numerous distinctions of
rank existed, that had been created by the legislation. nothing can be
more fictitious than a purely legal inferiority; nothing more contrary
to the instinct of [[mankind]] than these permanent divisions which had
been established between beings evidently similar. nevertheless these
divisions subsisted for ages [[age]]; they still subsist in many places; and
on all sides they have left imaginary vestiges, which [[time]] alone can
efface. if it be so difficult to root out an inequality which solely
originates in the [[law]], how are those distinctions to be destroyed which
seem to be based upon the immutable laws [[law]] of [[nature]] herself? when i
remember the extreme difficulty with which aristocratic bodies [[body]], of
whatever [[nature]] they may be, are commingled with the mass of the [[people]];
and the exceeding [[care]] which they take to preserve the ideal boundaries
of their caste inviolate, i despair of seeing an [[aristocracy]] disappear
which is founded upon visible and indelible signs. those who [[hope]] that
the europeans [[european]] will ever mix with the negroes, appear to me to delude
themselves; and i am not [[led]] to any such conclusion by my own [[reason]], or
by the evidence of facts [[fact]].

hitherto, wherever the whites have been the most powerful, they have
maintained the blacks in a subordinate or a servile position; wherever
the negroes have been strongest they have destroyed the whites; such
has been the only retribution which has ever taken place between the two
races.

i see that in a [[certain]] portion of the territory of the [[united]] states
at the [[present]] day, the legal barrier which separated the two races [[race]] is
tending to fall away, but not that which exists in the manners of the
country; [[slavery]] recedes, but the prejudice to which it has given birth
remains stationary. whosoever has inhabited the [[united]] states must have
perceived that in those parts of the union in which the negroes are no
longer slaves [[slave]], they have in no [[wise]] drawn nearer to the whites. on the
contrary, the prejudice of the [[race]] appears to be stronger in the states
which have abolished [[slavery]], than in those where it still exists; and
nowhere is it so intolerant as in those states where servitude has never
been known.

it is true, that in the north of the union, marriages [[marriage]] may be legally
contracted between negroes and whites; but [[public]] [[opinion]] would
stigmatize a [[man]] who should connect himself with a negress as infamous,
and it would be difficult to meet with a [[single]] instance of such a
union. the electoral franchise has been conferred upon the negroes in
almost all the states in which [[slavery]] has been abolished; but if they
come forward to vote, their lives [[life]] are in danger. if [[oppressed]], they may
bring an action at [[law]], but they will find none but whites amongst
their judges [[judge]]; and although they may legally serve as jurors, prejudice
repulses them from that office. the same schools do not receive the
child of the black and of the [[european]]. in the theatres, gold cannot
procure a seat for the servile [[race]] beside their former masters; in the
hospitals they [[lie]] apart; and although they are allowed to invoke the
same divinity as the whites, it must be at a different altar, and in
their own churches [[church]], with their own clergy. the gates of [[heaven]] are not
closed against these unhappy beings; but their inferiority is continued
to the very confines of the other [[world]]; when the negro is defunct, his
bones are cast aside, and the distinction of condition prevails even in
the equality of [[death]]. the negro is [[free]], but he can share neither the
rights, nor the pleasures [[pleasure]], nor the labor, nor the afflictions, nor the
tomb of him whose [[equal]] he has been declared to be; and he cannot meet
him upon [[fair]] terms in [[life]] or in [[death]].

in the south, where [[slavery]] still exists, the negroes are less carefully
kept apart; they sometimes share the labor and the recreations of the
whites; the whites [[consent]] to intermix with them to a [[certain]] extent,
and although the legislation treats them more harshly, the habits of the
people are more tolerant and compassionate. in the south the master is
not afraid to raise his [[slave]] to his own standing, because he knows [[know]] that
he can in a moment reduce him to the dust at [[pleasure]]. in the north the
white no longer distinctly perceives the barrier which separates
him from the degraded [[race]], and he shuns the negro with the more
pertinacity, since he fears [[fear]] lest they should some day be confounded
together.

amongst the americans of the south, [[nature]] sometimes reasserts her
rights, and restores a transient equality between the blacks and the
whites; but in the north [[pride]] restrains the most imperious of human
passions. the american of the northern states would perhaps allow the
negress to share his licentious pleasures [[pleasure]], if the laws [[law]] of his country
did not declare that she may aspire to be the legitimate partner of his
bed; but he recoils with [[horror]] from her who might become his [[wife]].

thus it is, in the [[united]] states, that the prejudice which repels the
negroes seems to increase in proportion as they are emancipated, and
inequality is sanctioned by the manners whilst it is effaced from the
laws of the [[country]]. but if the relative position of the two races [[race]] which
inhabit the [[united]] states is such as i have described, it may be asked
why the americans have abolished [[slavery]] in the north of the union,
why they maintain it in the south, and why they aggravate its hardships
there? the [[answer]] is easily given. it is not for the [[good]] of the
negroes, but for that of the whites, that measures are taken to abolish
slavery in the [[united]] states.

the first negroes were imported into virginia about the year 1621. *f
in [[america]], therefore, as well as in the rest of the globe, slavery
originated in the south. thence it spread from one settlement to
another; but the number of slaves [[slave]] diminished towards the northern
states, and the negro [[population]] was always very limited in new [[england]].
*g

[footnote f: see beverley's "history of virginia." see also in
jefferson's "memoirs" some [[curious]] details concerning the introduction
of negroes into virginia, and the first act which prohibited the
importation of them in 1778.]

[footnote g: the number of slaves [[slave]] was less considerable in the north,
but the advantages resulting from [[slavery]] were not more contested there
than in the south. in 1740, the legislature of the [[state]] of new york
declared that the direct importation of slaves [[slave]] ought to be encouraged
as much as possible, and smuggling severely punished in order not to
discourage the [[fair]] trader. (kent's "commentaries," vol. ii. p. 206.)
curious researches, by belknap, upon [[slavery]] in new [[england]], are to be
found in the "historical collection of massachusetts," vol. iv. p. 193.
it appears that negroes were introduced there in 1630, but that the
legislation and manners of the [[people]] were opposed to [[slavery]] from the
first; see also, in the same [[work]], the manner in which [[public]] [[opinion]],
and afterwards the laws [[law]], finally put an end to [[slavery]].]

a century had scarcely elapsed since the foundation of the colonies,
when the attention of the planters was struck by the extraordinary
fact, that the provinces which were comparatively destitute of slaves [[slave]],
increased in [[population]], in [[wealth]], and in [[prosperity]] more rapidly than
those which contained the [[greatest]] number of negroes. in the former,
however, the inhabitants were obliged to cultivate the soil themselves,
or by hired laborers; in the latter they were furnished with hands for
which they paid no wages; yet although labor and expenses were on
the one side, and ease with economy on the other, the former were in
possession of the most advantageous [[system]]. this consequence seemed to
be the more difficult to explain, since the settlers, who all belonged
to the same [[european]] [[race]], had the same habits, the same [[civilization]],
the same laws [[law]], and their shades of difference were extremely slight.

time, however, continued to advance, and the anglo-americans, spreading
beyond the coasts of the atlantic ocean, penetrated farther and farther
into the solitudes of the west; they met with a new soil and an unwonted
climate; the obstacles which opposed them were of the most various
character; their races [[race]] intermingled, the inhabitants of the south went
up towards the north, those of the north descended to the south; but in
the midst of all these causes, the same result occurred at every step,
and in general, the colonies in which there were no slaves [[slave]] became more
populous and more [[rich]] than those in which [[slavery]] flourished. the more
progress was made, the more was it shown that [[slavery]], which is so cruel
to the [[slave]], is prejudicial to the master.




chapter xviii: future condition of three races--part iv

but this [[truth]] was most satisfactorily demonstrated when civilization
reached the banks of the ohio. the stream which the indians [[indian]] had
distinguished by the name of ohio, or beautiful river, waters one of
the most magnificent valleys that has ever been made the abode of [[man]].
undulating lands [[land]] extend upon both shores of the ohio, whose soil affords
inexhaustible treasures to the laborer; on either bank the air is
wholesome and the [[climate]] mild, and each of them forms the extreme
frontier of a vast [[state]]: that which follows the numerous windings of
the ohio upon the left is called kentucky, that upon the [[right]] bears
the name of the river. these two states only differ in a [[single]] [[respect]];
kentucky has admitted [[slavery]], but the [[state]] of ohio has prohibited the
existence of slaves [[slave]] within its borders. *h

[footnote h: not only is [[slavery]] prohibited in ohio, but no [[free]] negroes
are allowed to enter the territory of that [[state]], or to hold [[property]] in
it. see the statutes of ohio.]

thus the traveller who floats down the current of the ohio to the spot
where that river falls into the mississippi, may be said to sail between
liberty and servitude; and a transient inspection of the surrounding
objects will convince him as to which of the two is most favorable to
mankind. upon the left bank of the stream the [[population]] is rare; from
time to [[time]] one descries a troop of slaves [[slave]] loitering in the half-desert
fields; the primaeval forest recurs at every turn; [[society]] seems to be
asleep, [[man]] to be idle, and [[nature]] alone offers a scene of activity and
of [[life]]. from the [[right]] bank, on the contrary, a confused hum is heard
which proclaims the presence of industry; the fields are covered with
abundant harvests, the elegance of the dwellings announces the taste and
activity of the laborer, and [[man]] appears to be in the enjoyment of that
wealth and contentment which is the [[reward]] of labor. *i

[footnote i: the activity of ohio is not confined to individuals [[individual]], but
the undertakings of the [[state]] are surprisingly [[great]]; a canal has been
established between lake erie and the ohio, by means of which the valley
of the mississippi communicates with the river of the north, and the
european commodities which arrive at new york may be forwarded by water
to new orleans across five hundred leagues of continent.]

the [[state]] of kentucky was founded in 1775, the [[state]] of ohio only twelve
years later; but twelve years are more in [[america]] than half a century in
europe, and, at the [[present]] day, the [[population]] of ohio exceeds that
of kentucky by two hundred and fifty thousand souls [[soul]]. *j these opposite
consequences of [[slavery]] and [[freedom]] may readily be understood, and they
suffice to explain many of the differences which we remark between the
civilization of antiquity and that of our own [[time]].

[footnote j: the exact numbers given by the census of 1830 were:
kentucky, 688,-844; ohio, 937,679. [in 1890 the [[population]] of ohio was
3,672,316, that of kentucky, 1,858,635.]]

upon the left bank of the ohio labor is confounded with the [[idea]] of
slavery, upon the [[right]] bank it is identified with that of prosperity
and improvement; on the one side it is degraded, on the other it is
honored; on the former territory no [[white]] laborers can be found, for
they would be afraid of assimilating themselves to the negroes; on the
latter no one is idle, for the [[white]] [[population]] extends its activity and
its [[intelligence]] to every [[kind]] of employment. thus the [[men]] whose task
it is to cultivate the [[rich]] soil of kentucky are ignorant and lukewarm;
whilst those who are active and enlightened either do nothing or pass
over into the [[state]] of ohio, where they may [[work]] without dishonor.

it is true that in kentucky the planters are not obliged to [[pay]] wages
to the slaves [[slave]] whom they employ; but they derive small profits [[profit]] from their
labor, whilst the wages paid to [[free]] workmen would be returned with
interest in the value of their services. the [[free]] workman is paid, but
he does his [[work]] quicker than the [[slave]], and rapidity of execution is
one of the [[great]] elements of economy. the [[white]] sells his services, but
they are only purchased at the times [[time]] at which they may be useful; the
black can claim no remuneration for his toil, but the expense of his
maintenance is perpetual; he must be supported in his old [[age]] as well
as in the prime of manhood, in his profitless infancy as well as in
the productive years of [[youth]]. payment must equally be made in order to
obtain the services of either class of [[men]]: the [[free]] workman receives
his wages in [[money]], the [[slave]] in [[education]], in food, in [[care]], and in
clothing. the [[money]] which a master spends in the maintenance of his
slaves goes gradually and in detail, so that it is scarcely perceived;
the salary of the [[free]] workman is paid in a round sum, which appears
only to enrich the [[individual]] who receives it, but in the end the slave
has cost more than the [[free]] servant, and his labor is less productive.
*k

[footnote k: independently of these causes, which, wherever [[free]] workmen
abound, render their labor more productive and more economical than that
of slaves [[slave]], another cause may be pointed out which is peculiar to the
united states: the sugar-cane has hitherto been cultivated with success
only upon the banks of the mississippi, near the mouth of that river in
the gulf of mexico. in louisiana the cultivation of the sugar-cane is
exceedingly lucrative, and nowhere does a laborer earn so much by his
work, and, as there is always a [[certain]] relation between the cost of
production and the value of the [[produce]], the price of slaves [[slave]] is very
high in louisiana. but louisiana is one of the confederated states, and
slaves may be carried thither from all parts of the union; the price
given for slaves [[slave]] in new orleans consequently raises the value of slaves
in all the other markets. the consequence of this is, that in the
countries where the [[land]] is less productive, the cost of [[slave]] labor
is still very considerable, which gives an additional advantage to the
competition of [[free]] labor.]

the influence of [[slavery]] extends still further; it affects the character
of the master, and imparts a peculiar tendency to his ideas [[idea]] and his
tastes. upon both banks of the ohio, the [[character]] of the inhabitants is
enterprising and energetic; but this vigor is very differently exercised
in the two states. the [[white]] inhabitant of ohio, who is obliged to
subsist by his own exertions, regards temporal [[prosperity]] as the
principal aim of his existence; and as the [[country]] which he occupies
presents inexhaustible resources to his industry and ever-varying lures
to his activity, his acquisitive ardor surpasses the ordinary limits of
human cupidity: he is tormented by the [[desire]] of [[wealth]], and he boldly
enters upon every path which [[fortune]] opens to him; he becomes a sailor,
a pioneer, an artisan, or a laborer with the same indifference, and he
supports, with [[equal]] constancy, the fatigues and the dangers incidental
to these various professions; the resources of his [[intelligence]] are
astonishing, and his avidity in the pursuit of gain amounts to a species
of heroism.

but the kentuckian scorns not only labor, but all the undertakings which
labor promotes; as he lives [[life]] in an idle independence, his tastes are
those of an idle [[man]]; [[money]] loses a portion of its value in his [[eyes]];
he covets [[wealth]] much less than [[pleasure]] and excitement; and the energy
which his neighbor devotes to gain, turns with him to a passionate love
of field sports [[sport]] and [[military]] exercises; he delights in [[violent]] bodily
exertion, he is familiar with the use of arms, and is accustomed from
a very early [[age]] to expose his [[life]] in [[single]] combat. thus [[slavery]] not
only prevents the whites from becoming opulent, but even from desiring
to become so.

as the same causes have been continually producing opposite effects for
the [[last]] two centuries in the british colonies of north [[america]], they
have established a very striking difference between the commercial
capacity of the inhabitants of the south and those of the north. at the
present day it is only the northern states which are in possession
of shipping, manufactures, railroads, and canals. this difference is
perceptible not only in comparing the north with the south, but in
comparing the several southern states. almost all the individuals [[individual]] who
carry on commercial operations, or who endeavor to turn [[slave]] labor to
account in the most southern districts of the union, have emigrated from
the north. the natives of the northern states are constantly spreading
over that portion of the american territory where they have less to fear
from competition; they discover resources there which escaped the notice
of the inhabitants; and, as they comply with a [[system]] which they do not
approve, they succeed in turning it to [[better]] advantage than those who
first founded and who still maintain it.

were i inclined to continue this parallel, i could easily prove that
almost all the differences which may be remarked between the characters
of the americans in the southern and in the northern states have
originated in [[slavery]]; but this would divert me from my [[subject]], and my
present intention is not to point out all the consequences of servitude,
but those effects which it has produced upon the [[prosperity]] of the
countries which have admitted it.

the influence of [[slavery]] upon the production of [[wealth]] must have been
very imperfectly known in antiquity, as [[slavery]] then obtained throughout
the civilized [[world]]; and the nations which were unacquainted with
it were barbarous. and indeed [[christianity]] only abolished slavery
by advocating the claims of the [[slave]]; at the [[present]] [[time]] it may be
attacked in the name of the master, and, upon this point, interest is
reconciled with morality.

as these truths [[truth]] became apparent in the [[united]] states, [[slavery]] receded
before the [[progress]] of [[experience]]. servitude had begun in the south, and
had thence spread towards the north; but it now retires again. [[freedom]],
which started from the north, now descends uninterruptedly towards
the south. amongst the [[great]] states, pennsylvania now constitutes the
extreme limit of [[slavery]] to the north: but even within those limits
the [[slave]] [[system]] is shaken: maryland, which is immediately below
pennsylvania, is preparing for its abolition; and virginia, which comes
next to maryland, is already discussing its utility and its dangers. *l

[footnote l: a peculiar [[reason]] contributes to detach the two
last-mentioned states from the cause of [[slavery]]. the former [[wealth]] of
this part of the union was principally derived from the cultivation of
tobacco. this cultivation is specially carried on by slaves [[slave]]; but within
the [[last]] few years the market-price of tobacco has diminished, whilst
the value of the slaves [[slave]] remains the same. thus the ratio between the
cost of production and the value of the [[produce]] is changed. the natives
of maryland and virginia are therefore more disposed than they were
thirty years ago, to give up [[slave]] labor in the cultivation of tobacco,
or to give up [[slavery]] and tobacco at the same [[time]].]

no [[great]] [[change]] takes place in [[human]] [[institutions]] without involving
amongst its causes the [[law]] of [[inheritance]]. when the [[law]] of primogeniture
obtained in the south, each [[family]] was represented by a wealthy
individual, who was neither compelled nor induced to labor; and he was
surrounded, as by parasitic plants, by the other members of his family
who were then excluded by [[law]] from sharing the [[common]] [[inheritance]],
and who [[led]] the same [[kind]] of [[life]] as himself. the very same thing
then occurred in all the families [[family]] of the south as still happens in the
wealthy families [[family]] of some countries [[country]] in [[europe]], namely, that the younger
sons remain in the same [[state]] of idleness as their elder [[brother]],
without being as [[rich]] as he is. this identical result seems to be
produced in [[europe]] and in [[america]] by wholly analogous causes. in
the south of the [[united]] states the whole [[race]] of whites formed an
aristocratic [[body]], which was headed by a [[certain]] number of privileged
individuals, whose [[wealth]] was permanent, and whose leisure was
hereditary. these leaders of the american nobility kept alive the
traditional prejudices of the [[white]] [[race]] in the [[body]] of which they were
the representatives, and maintained the [[honor]] of inactive [[life]]. this
aristocracy contained many who were [[poor]], but none who would [[work]]; its
members preferred want to labor, consequently no competition was set on
foot against negro laborers and slaves [[slave]], and, whatever [[opinion]] might be
entertained as to the utility of their efforts, it was indispensable to
employ them, since there was no one else to [[work]].

no sooner was the [[law]] of primogeniture abolished than fortunes [[fortune]] began
to diminish, and all the families [[family]] of the [[country]] were simultaneously
reduced to a [[state]] in which labor became necessary to procure the means
of subsistence: several of them have since entirely disappeared, and
all of them learned to look forward to the [[time]] at which it would be
necessary for everyone to provide for his own wants. wealthy individuals
are still to be met with, but they no longer constitute a compact and
hereditary [[body]], nor have they been able to adopt a line of conduct in
which they could persevere, and which they could infuse into all ranks
of [[society]]. the prejudice which stigmatized labor was in the first place
abandoned by [[common]] [[consent]]; the number of needy [[men]] was increased, and
the needy were allowed to gain a laborious subsistence without blushing
for their exertions. thus one of the most immediate consequences of the
partible quality of estates has been to create a class of [[free]] laborers.
as soon as a competition was set on foot between the [[free]] laborer and
the [[slave]], the inferiority of the latter became manifest, and slavery
was attacked in its fundamental [[principle]], which is the interest of the
master.

as [[slavery]] recedes, the black [[population]] follows its retrograde course,
and returns with it towards those tropical regions from which it
originally came. however singular this [[fact]] may at first appear to
be, it may readily be explained. although the americans abolish the
principle of [[slavery]], they do not set their slaves [[slave]] [[free]]. to illustrate
this remark, i will quote the [[example]] of the [[state]] of new york. in 1788,
the [[state]] of new york prohibited the sale of slaves [[slave]] within its limits,
which was an indirect method of prohibiting the importation of blacks.
thenceforward the number of negroes could only increase according to
the ratio of the [[natural]] increase of [[population]]. but eight years later
a more decisive measure was taken, and it was enacted that all children
born of [[slave]] parents after july 4, 1799, should be [[free]]. no increase
could then take place, and although slaves [[slave]] still existed, [[slavery]] might
be said to be abolished.

from the [[time]] at which a northern [[state]] prohibited the importation of
slaves, no slaves [[slave]] were brought from the south to be sold in its markets.
on the other hand, as the sale of slaves [[slave]] was forbidden in that [[state]],
an owner was no longer able to get rid of his [[slave]] (who thus became a
burdensome possession) otherwise than by transporting him to the south.
but when a northern [[state]] declared that the [[son]] of the [[slave]] should be
born [[free]], the [[slave]] lost a large portion of his market value, since his
posterity was no longer included in the bargain, and the owner had then
a [[strong]] interest in transporting him to the south. thus the same law
prevents the slaves [[slave]] of the south from coming to the northern states, and
drives those of the north to the south.

the want of [[free]] hands is [[felt]] in a [[state]] in proportion as the number of
slaves decreases. but in proportion as labor is performed by [[free]] hands,
slave labor becomes less productive; and the [[slave]] is then a useless
or onerous possession, whom it is important to export to those southern
states where the same competition is not to be feared. thus the
abolition of [[slavery]] does not set the [[slave]] [[free]], but it merely
transfers him from one master to another, and from the north to the
south.

the emancipated negroes, and those born after the abolition of [[slavery]],
do not, indeed, migrate from the north to the south; but their situation
with regard to the europeans [[european]] is not unlike that of the aborigines of
america; they remain half civilized, and deprived of their rights [[right]] in
the midst of a [[population]] which is far superior to them in [[wealth]] and in
knowledge; where they are exposed to the [[tyranny]] of the laws [[law]] *m and the
intolerance of the [[people]]. on some accounts they are still more to be
pitied than the indians [[indian]], since they are haunted by the reminiscence of
slavery, and they cannot claim possession of a [[single]] portion of the
soil: many of them perish miserably, *n and the rest congregate in the
great towns, where they perform the meanest offices, and lead a wretched
and precarious existence.

[footnote m: the states in which [[slavery]] is abolished usually do what
they can to render their territory disagreeable to the negroes as
a place of residence; and as a [[kind]] of emulation exists between the
different states in this [[respect]], the unhappy blacks can only choose the
least of the evils [[evil]] which beset them.]

[footnote n: there is a very [[great]] difference between the mortality
of the blacks and of the whites in the states in which [[slavery]] is
abolished; from 1820 to 1831 only one out of forty-two individuals
of the [[white]] [[population]] died in philadelphia; but one negro out of
twenty-one individuals [[individual]] of the black [[population]] died in the same space of
time. the [[mortality]] is by no means so [[great]] amongst the negroes who are
still slaves [[slave]]. (see emerson's "medical statistics," p. 28.)]

but even if the number of negroes continued to increase as rapidly as
when they were still in a [[state]] of [[slavery]], as the number of whites
augments with twofold rapidity since the abolition of [[slavery]], the
blacks would soon be, as it were, lost in the midst of a strange
population.

a district which is cultivated by slaves [[slave]] is in general more scantily
peopled than a district cultivated by [[free]] labor: moreover, [[america]] is
still a new [[country]], and a [[state]] is therefore not half peopled at the
time when it abolishes [[slavery]]. no sooner is an end put to [[slavery]] than
the want of [[free]] labor is [[felt]], and a crowd of enterprising adventurers
immediately arrive from all parts of the [[country]], who hasten to profit
by the fresh resources which are then opened to industry. the soil
is soon divided amongst them, and a [[family]] of [[white]] settlers takes
possession of each tract of [[country]]. besides which, [[european]] emigration
is exclusively directed to the [[free]] states; for what would be the
fate of a [[poor]] emigrant who crosses the atlantic in search of ease and
happiness if he were to [[land]] in a [[country]] where labor is stigmatized as
degrading?

thus the [[white]] [[population]] grows by its [[natural]] increase, and at the same
time by the immense influx of emigrants; whilst the black population
receives no emigrants, and is upon its decline. the proportion which
existed between the two races [[race]] is soon inverted. the negroes constitute a
scanty remnant, a [[poor]] tribe of vagrants, which is lost in the midst of
an immense [[people]] in full possession of the [[land]]; and the presence of
the blacks is only marked by the [[injustice]] and the hardships of which
they are the unhappy victims.

in several of the western states the negro [[race]] never made its
appearance, and in all the northern states it is rapidly declining. thus
the [[great]] [[question]] of its future condition is confined within a narrow
circle, where it becomes less formidable, though not more easy of
solution.

the more we descend towards the south, the more difficult does it become
to abolish [[slavery]] with advantage: and this arises from several physical
causes which it is important to point out.

the first of these causes is the [[climate]]; it is well known that in
proportion as europeans [[european]] approach the tropics they suffer more from
labor. many of the americans even assert that within a [[certain]] latitude
the exertions which a negro can make without danger are fatal to them;
*o but i do not [[think]] that this [[opinion]], which is so favorable to
the indolence of the inhabitants of southern regions, is confirmed by
experience. the southern parts of the union are not hotter than the
south of [[italy]] and of [[spain]]; *p and it may be [[asked]] why the european
cannot [[work]] as well there as in the two latter countries [[country]]. if [[slavery]] has
been abolished in [[italy]] and in [[spain]] without causing the destruction of
the masters, why should not the same thing take place in the union? i
cannot [[believe]] that [[nature]] has prohibited the europeans [[european]] in georgia and
the floridas, under [[pain]] of [[death]], from raising the means of subsistence
from the soil, but their labor would unquestionably be more irksome and
less productive to them than to the inhabitants of new [[england]]. as the
free workman thus loses a portion of his superiority over the [[slave]] in
the southern states, there are fewer inducements to abolish [[slavery]].

[footnote o: this is true of the spots in which rice is cultivated;
rice-grounds, which are unwholesome in all countries [[country]], are particularly
dangerous in those regions which are exposed to the beams of a tropical
sun. europeans [[european]] would not find it easy to cultivate the soil in that part
of the new [[world]] if it must be necessarily be made to [[produce]] rice; but
may they not subsist without rice-grounds?]

[footnote p: these states are nearer to the equator than [[italy]] and
spain, but the temperature of the continent of [[america]] is very much
lower than that of [[europe]].

the spanish [[government]] formerly caused a [[certain]] number of peasants
from the acores to be transported into a district of louisiana called
attakapas, by way of experiment. these settlers still cultivate the soil
without the assistance of slaves [[slave]], but their industry is so languid as
scarcely to supply their most necessary wants.]

all the plants of [[europe]] grow in the northern parts of the union; the
south has special productions of its own. it has been observed that
slave labor is a very expensive method of cultivating corn. the farmer
of corn [[land]] in a [[country]] where [[slavery]] is unknown habitually retains a
small number of laborers in his service, and at seed-time and harvest
he hires several additional hands, who only [[live]] at his cost for a short
period. but the agriculturist in a [[slave]] [[state]] is obliged to keep a
large number of slaves [[slave]] the whole year round, in order to sow his fields
and to gather in his crops, although their services are only required
for a few weeks; but slaves [[slave]] are unable to wait till they are hired, and
to subsist by their own labor in the mean [[time]] like [[free]] laborers; in
order to have their services they must be bought. [[slavery]], independently
of its general disadvantages, is therefore still more inapplicable to
countries in which corn is cultivated than to those which produce
crops of a different [[kind]]. the cultivation of tobacco, of cotton, and
especially of the sugar-cane, demands, on the other hand, unremitting
attention: and [[women]] and [[children]] are employed in it, whose services are
of but little use in the cultivation of wheat. thus [[slavery]] is naturally
more fitted to the countries [[country]] from which these productions are derived.
tobacco, cotton, and the sugar-cane are exclusively grown in the south,
and they form one of the principal sources of the [[wealth]] of those
states. if [[slavery]] were abolished, the inhabitants of the south would
be constrained to adopt one of two alternatives: they must either change
their [[system]] of cultivation, and then they would come into competition
with the more active and more experienced inhabitants of the north; or,
if they continued to cultivate the same [[produce]] without [[slave]] labor,
they would have to support the competition of the other states of the
south, which might still retain their slaves [[slave]]. thus, peculiar reasons
for maintaining [[slavery]] [[exist]] in the south which do not operate in the
north.

but there is yet another motive which is more cogent than all the
others: the south might indeed, rigorously speaking, abolish [[slavery]];
but how should it rid its territory of the black [[population]]? slaves
and [[slavery]] are driven from the north by the same [[law]], but this twofold
result cannot be hoped for in the south.

the arguments which i have adduced to show that [[slavery]] is more natural
and more advantageous in the south than in the north, sufficiently prove
that the number of slaves [[slave]] must be far greater in the former districts.
it was to the southern settlements that the first africans were brought,
and it is there that the [[greatest]] number of them have always been
imported. as we advance towards the south, the prejudice which sanctions
idleness increases in [[power]]. in the states nearest to the tropics there
is not a [[single]] [[white]] laborer; the negroes are consequently much
more numerous in the south than in the north. and, as i have already
observed, this disproportion increases daily, since the negroes are
transferred to one part of the union as soon as [[slavery]] is abolished in
the other. thus the black [[population]] augments in the south, not only by
its [[natural]] fecundity, but by the compulsory emigration of the negroes
from the north; and the african [[race]] has causes of increase in the south
very analogous to those which so powerfully accelerate the [[growth]] of the
european [[race]] in the north.

in the [[state]] of maine there is one negro in 300 inhabitants; in
massachusetts, one in 100; in new york, two in 100; in pennsylvania,
three in the same number; in maryland, thirty-four; in virginia,
forty-two; and lastly, in south carolina *q fifty-five per cent. such
was the proportion of the black [[population]] to the whites in the year
1830. but this proportion is perpetually changing, as it constantly
decreases in the north and augments in the south.


[footnote q: we find it asserted in an american [[work]], entitled "letters
on the colonization [[society]]," by mr. carey, 1833, "that for the last
forty years the black [[race]] has increased more rapidly than the white
race in the [[state]] of south carolina; and that if we take the average
population of the five states of the south into which slaves [[slave]] were first
introduced, viz., maryland, virginia, south carolina, north carolina,
and georgia, we shall find that from 1790 to 1830 the whites have
augmented in the proportion of 80 to 100, and the blacks in that of 112
to 100."

in the [[united]] states, in 1830, the [[population]] of the two races [[race]] stood as
follows:--

states where [[slavery]] is abolished, 6,565,434 whites; 120,520 blacks.
slave states, 3,960,814 whites; 2,208,102 blacks. [in 1890 the united
states contained a [[population]] of 54,983,890 whites, and 7,638,360
negroes.]]

it is evident that the most southern states of the union cannot abolish
slavery without incurring very [[great]] dangers, which the north had no
reason to apprehend when it emancipated its black [[population]]. we
have already shown the [[system]] by which the northern states secure the
transition from [[slavery]] to [[freedom]], by keeping the [[present]] generation
in chains, and setting their descendants [[free]]; by this means the negroes
are gradually introduced into [[society]]; and whilst the [[men]] who might
abuse their [[freedom]] are kept in a [[state]] of servitude, those who are
emancipated may learn the art [[arts]] of being [[free]] before they become their own
masters. but it would be difficult to apply this method in the south. to
declare that all the negroes born after a [[certain]] period shall be [[free]],
is to introduce the [[principle]] and the notion of [[liberty]] into the heart
of [[slavery]]; the blacks whom the [[law]] thus maintains in a [[state]] of slavery
from which their [[children]] are delivered, are astonished at so unequal a
fate, and their astonishment is only the prelude to their impatience
and irritation. thenceforward [[slavery]] loses, in their [[eyes]], that kind
of [[moral]] [[power]] which it derived from [[time]] and habit; it is reduced to
a mere palpable [[abuse]] of [[force]]. the northern states had nothing to fear
from the contrast, because in them the blacks were few in number, and
the [[white]] [[population]] was very considerable. but if this faint dawn
of [[freedom]] were to show two millions of [[men]] their true position, the
oppressors would have [[reason]] to tremble. after having affranchised the
children of their slaves [[slave]] the europeans [[european]] of the southern states would
very shortly be obliged to extend the same benefit to the whole black
population.




chapter xviii: future condition of three races--part v

in the north, as i have already remarked, a twofold migration ensues
upon the abolition of [[slavery]], or even precedes that event when
circumstances have rendered it probable; the slaves [[slave]] quit the country
to be transported southwards; and the whites of the northern states, as
well as the emigrants from [[europe]], hasten to fill up their place. but
these two causes cannot operate in the same manner in the southern
states. on the one hand, the mass of slaves [[slave]] is too [[great]] for any
expectation of their ever being removed from the [[country]] to be
entertained; and on the other hand, the europeans [[european]] and anglo-americans of
the north are afraid to come to inhabit a [[country]] in which labor has not
yet been reinstated in its rightful honors. besides, they very justly
look upon the states in which the proportion of the negroes equals [[equal]] or
exceeds that of the whites, as exposed to very [[great]] dangers; and they
refrain from turning their activity in that direction.

thus the inhabitants of the south would not be able, like their northern
countrymen, to initiate the slaves [[slave]] gradually into a [[state]] of [[freedom]] by
abolishing [[slavery]]; they have no means of perceptibly diminishing the
black [[population]], and they would remain unsupported to repress its
excesses. so that in the course of a few years, a [[great]] [[people]] of free
negroes would [[exist]] in the [[heart]] of a [[white]] nation of [[equal]] size.

the same abuses [[abuse]] of [[power]] which still maintain [[slavery]], would then become
the source of the most alarming perils which the [[white]] [[population]] of the
south might have to apprehend. at the [[present]] [[time]] the descendants of
the europeans [[european]] are the sole owners of the [[land]]; the absolute masters of
all labor; and the only persons [[person]] who are possessed of [[wealth]], [[knowledge]],
and arms. the black is destitute of all these advantages, but he
subsists without them because he is a [[slave]]. if he were [[free]], and
obliged to provide for his own subsistence, would it be possible for
him to remain without these things and to support [[life]]? or would not the
very instruments of the [[present]] superiority of the [[white]], whilst slavery
exists, expose him to a thousand dangers if it were abolished?

as long as the negro remains a [[slave]], he may be kept in a condition
not very far removed from that of the brutes; but, with his [[liberty]],
he cannot but acquire a [[degree]] of instruction which will enable him to
appreciate his misfortunes, and to discern a remedy for them. moreover,
there exists a singular [[principle]] of relative [[justice]] which is very
firmly implanted in the [[human]] [[heart]]. [[men]] are much more forcibly struck
by those inequalities which [[exist]] within the circle of the same class,
than with those which may be remarked between different classes. it is
more easy for them to admit [[slavery]], than to allow several millions
of [[citizens]] to [[exist]] under a load of eternal infamy and hereditary
wretchedness. in the north the [[population]] of freed negroes feels [[feel]] these
hardships and resents these indignities; but its numbers and its powers
are small, whilst in the south it would be numerous and [[strong]].

as soon as it is admitted that the whites and the emancipated blacks
are placed upon the same territory in the situation of two alien
communities, it will readily be understood that there are but two
alternatives for the future; the negroes and the whites must either
wholly part or wholly mingle. i have already expressed the conviction
which i entertain as to the latter event. *r i do not imagine that
the [[white]] and black races [[race]] will ever [[live]] in any [[country]] upon an equal
footing. but i [[believe]] the difficulty to be still greater in the
united states than elsewhere. an isolated [[individual]] may surmount the
prejudices of [[religion]], of his [[country]], or of his [[race]], and if this
individual is a [[king]] he may effect surprising changes [[change]] in [[society]]; but a
whole [[people]] cannot rise, as it were, above itself. a despot who should
subject the americans and their former slaves [[slave]] to the same yoke, might
perhaps succeed in commingling their races [[race]]; but as long as the american
democracy remains at the head of affairs, no one will undertake so
difficult a task; and it may be foreseen that the freer the white
population of the [[united]] states becomes, the more isolated will it
remain. *s

[footnote r: this [[opinion]] is sanctioned by authorities [[authority]] infinitely
weightier than anything that i can say: thus, for instance, it is stated
in the "memoirs of jefferson" (as collected by m. conseil), "nothing is
more clearly written in the [[book]] of [[destiny]] than the emancipation of the
blacks; and it is equally [[certain]] that the two races [[race]] will never [[live]] in
a [[state]] of [[equal]] [[freedom]] under the same [[government]], so insurmountable
are the barriers which [[nature]], habit, and opinions [[opinion]] have established
between them."]

[footnote s: if the british west [[india]] planters had governed themselves,
they would assuredly not have passed the [[slave]] emancipation bill which
the mother-country has recently imposed upon them.]

i have previously observed that the mixed [[race]] is the true bond of union
between the europeans [[european]] and the indians [[indian]]; just so the mulattoes are the
true means of transition between the [[white]] and the negro; so that
wherever mulattoes abound, the intermixture of the two races [[race]] is not
impossible. in some parts of [[america]], the [[european]] and the negro races
are so crossed by one another, that it is rare to meet with a [[man]] who is
entirely black, or entirely [[white]]: when they are arrived at this point,
the two races [[race]] may really be said to be combined; or rather to have been
absorbed in a third [[race]], which is connected with both without being
identical with either.

of all the europeans [[european]] the english are those who have mixed least with the
negroes. more mulattoes are to be seen in the south of the union than in
the north, but still they are infinitely more scarce than in any other
european colony: mulattoes are by no means numerous in the united
states; they have no [[force]] peculiar to themselves, and when quarrels
originating in differences of color take place, they generally side
with the whites; just as the lackeys of the [[great]], in [[europe]], assume the
contemptuous airs of nobility to the lower orders.

the [[pride]] of origin, which is [[natural]] to the english, is singularly
augmented by the personal [[pride]] which democratic [[liberty]] fosters amongst
the americans: the [[white]] citizen of the [[united]] states is proud of his
race, and proud of himself. but if the whites and the negroes do not
intermingle in the north of the union, how should they mix in the south?
can it be supposed for an instant, that an american of the southern
states, placed, as he must forever be, between the [[white]] [[man]] with all
his physical and [[moral]] superiority and the negro, will ever [[think]] of
preferring the latter? the americans of the southern states have two
powerful [[passions]] which will always keep them aloof; the first is the
fear of being assimilated to the negroes, their former slaves [[slave]]; and the
second the dread of sinking below the whites, their neighbors.

if i were called upon to predict what will probably occur at some future
time, i should say, that the abolition of [[slavery]] in the south will,
in the [[common]] course of things, increase the repugnance of the white
population for the [[men]] of color. i found this [[opinion]] upon the analogous
observation which i already had [[occasion]] to make in the north. i there
remarked that the [[white]] inhabitants of the north avoid the negroes with
increasing [[care]], in proportion as the legal barriers of separation are
removed by the legislature; and why should not the same result
take place in the south? in the north, the whites are deterred from
intermingling with the blacks by the [[fear]] of an imaginary danger; in the
south, where the danger would be real, i cannot imagine that the fear
would be less general.

if, on the one hand, it be admitted (and the [[fact]] is unquestionable)
that the colored [[population]] perpetually accumulates in the extreme
south, and that it increases more rapidly than that of the whites; and
if, on the other hand, it be allowed that it is impossible to foresee
a [[time]] at which the whites and the blacks will be so intermingled as to
derive the same benefits from [[society]]; must it not be inferred that the
blacks and the whites will, sooner or later, come to open strife in the
southern states of the union? but if it be [[asked]] what the issue of the
struggle is likely to be, it will readily be understood that we are
here left to form a very vague surmise of the [[truth]]. the [[human]] [[mind]] may
succeed in tracing a wide circle, as it were, which includes the course
of future events; but within that circle a thousand various chances
and circumstances may direct it in as many different ways; and in
every picture of the future there is a dim spot, which the eye of the
understanding cannot penetrate. it appears, however, to be extremely
probable that in the west [[indian]] islands the [[white]] [[race]] is destined to
be subdued, and the black [[population]] to share the same [[fate]] upon the
continent.

in the west [[india]] islands the [[white]] planters are surrounded by an
immense black [[population]]; on the continent, the blacks are placed
between the ocean and an innumerable [[people]], which already extends over
them in a dense mass, from the icy confines of canada to the frontiers
of virginia, and from the banks of the missouri to the shores of the
atlantic. if the [[white]] [[citizens]] of north [[america]] remain [[united]], it
cannot be supposed that the negroes will escape the destruction with
which they are menaced; they must be subdued by want or by the [[sword]].
but the black [[population]] which is accumulated along the coast of
the gulf of mexico, has a [[chance]] of [[success]] if the american union is
dissolved when the struggle between the two races [[race]] begins. if the federal
tie were broken, the [[citizens]] of the south would be [[wrong]] to rely upon
any lasting succor from their northern countrymen. the latter are
well aware that the danger can never reach them; and unless they are
constrained to march to the assistance of the south by a positive
obligation, it may be foreseen that the sympathy of color will be
insufficient to stimulate their exertions.

yet, at whatever period the strife may break out, the whites of the
south, even if they are abandoned to their own resources, will enter
the lists with an immense superiority of [[knowledge]] and of the means of
warfare; but the blacks will have numerical [[strength]] and the energy of
despair upon their side, and these are powerful resources to [[men]] who
have taken up arms. the [[fate]] of the [[white]] [[population]] of the southern
states will, perhaps, be similar to that of the moors in [[spain]]. after
having occupied the [[land]] for centuries, it will perhaps be forced to
retire to the [[country]] whence its [[ancestors]] came, and to abandon to the
negroes the possession of a territory, which providence seems to have
more peculiarly destined for them, since they can subsist and labor in
it more easily that the whites.

the danger of a conflict between the [[white]] and the black inhabitants of
the southern states of the union--a danger which, however remote it may
be, is inevitable--perpetually haunts the [[imagination]] of the americans.
the inhabitants of the north make it a [[common]] topic of conversation,
although they have no direct injury to [[fear]] from the struggle; but they
vainly endeavor to devise some means of obviating the misfortunes which
they foresee. in the southern states the [[subject]] is not discussed: the
planter does not allude to the future in conversing with strangers; the
citizen does not communicate his apprehensions to his [[friends]]; he seeks
to conceal them from himself; but there is something more alarming in
the tacit forebodings of the south, than in the clamorous fears [[fear]] of the
northern states.

this all-pervading disquietude has given birth to an undertaking which
is but little known, but which may have the effect of changing the fate
of a portion of the [[human]] [[race]]. from apprehension of the dangers which
i have just been describing, a [[certain]] number of american [[citizens]] have
formed a [[society]] for the [[purpose]] of exporting to the coast of guinea,
at their own expense, such [[free]] negroes as may be willing to escape from
the oppression to which they are [[subject]]. *t in 1820, the [[society]] to
which i allude formed a settlement in [[africa]], upon the seventh degree
of north latitude, which bears the name of liberia. the most recent
intelligence informs us that 2,500 negroes are collected there; they
have introduced the democratic [[institutions]] of [[america]] into the country
of their forefathers; and liberia has a representative [[system]] of
government, negro jurymen, negro magistrates, and negro priests [[priest]];
churches have been built, newspapers established, and, by a singular
change in the vicissitudes of the [[world]], [[white]] [[men]] are prohibited from
sojourning within the settlement. *u

[footnote t: this [[society]] assumed the name of "the [[society]] for
the colonization of the blacks." see its annual reports; and more
particularly the fifteenth. see also the pamphlet, to which allusion has
already been made, entitled "letters on the colonization [[society]], and on
its probable results," by mr. carey, philadelphia, 1833.]

[footnote u: this [[last]] regulation was laid down by the founders of
the settlement; they apprehended that a [[state]] of things might arise
in [[africa]] similar to that which exists on the frontiers of the united
states, and that if the negroes, like the indians [[indian]], were brought into
collision with a [[people]] more enlightened than themselves, they would be
destroyed before they could be civilized.]

this is indeed a [[strange]] caprice of [[fortune]]. two hundred years have now
elapsed since the inhabitants of [[europe]] undertook to tear the negro
from his [[family]] and his [[home]], in order to transport him to the shores of
north [[america]]; at the [[present]] day, the [[european]] settlers are engaged in
sending back the descendants of those very negroes to the continent from
which they were originally taken; and the barbarous africans have been
brought into contact with [[civilization]] in the midst of bondage, and have
become acquainted with [[free]] [[political]] [[institutions]] in [[slavery]]. up to the
present [[time]] [[africa]] has been closed against the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] of the
whites; but the inventions of [[europe]] will perhaps penetrate into those
regions, now that they are introduced by africans themselves. the
settlement of liberia is founded upon a lofty and a most fruitful [[idea]];
but whatever may be its results with regard to the continent of [[africa]],
it can afford no remedy to the new [[world]].

in twelve years the colonization [[society]] has transported 2,500 negroes
to [[africa]]; in the same space of [[time]] about 700,000 blacks were born in
the [[united]] states. if the colony of liberia were so situated as to be
able to receive thousands of new inhabitants every year, and if the
negroes were in a [[state]] to be sent thither with advantage; if the union
were to supply the [[society]] with annual subsidies, *v and to transport
the negroes to [[africa]] in the vessels of the [[state]], it would still be
unable to counterpoise the [[natural]] increase of [[population]] amongst the
blacks; and as it could not remove as many [[men]] in a year as are born
upon its territory within the same space of [[time]], it would fail in
suspending the [[growth]] of the [[evil]] which is daily increasing in the
states. *w the negro [[race]] will never leave those shores of the american
continent, to which it was brought by the [[passions]] and the vices [[vice]] of
europeans; and it will not disappear from the new [[world]] as long as it
continues to [[exist]]. the inhabitants of the [[united]] states may retard
the calamities which they apprehend, but they cannot now [[destroy]] their
efficient cause.

[footnote v: nor would these be the only difficulties attendant upon
the undertaking; if the union undertook to buy up the negroes now in
america, in order to transport them to [[africa]], the price of slaves [[slave]],
increasing with their scarcity, would soon become enormous; and the
states of the north would never [[consent]] to expend such [[great]] sums for a
purpose which would procure such small advantages to themselves. if the
union took possession of the slaves [[slave]] in the southern states by [[force]], or
at a rate determined by [[law]], an insurmountable [[resistance]] would arise in
that part of the [[country]]. both alternatives are equally impossible.]

[footnote w: in 1830 there were in the [[united]] states 2,010,327 slaves
and 319,439 [[free]] blacks, in all 2,329,766 negroes: which formed about
one-fifth of the total [[population]] of the [[united]] states at that [[time]].]

i am obliged to confess that i do not regard the abolition of slavery
as a means of warding off the struggle of the two races [[race]] in the united
states. the negroes may long remain slaves [[slave]] without complaining; but if
they are once raised to the level of [[free]] [[men]], they will soon revolt at
being deprived of all their civil rights [[right]]; and as they cannot become the
equals of the whites, they will speedily declare themselves as enemies [[enemy]].
in the north everything contributed to facilitate the emancipation of
the slaves [[slave]]; and [[slavery]] was abolished, without placing the [[free]] negroes
in a position which could become formidable, since their number was too
small for them ever to claim the exercise of their rights [[right]]. but such is
not the case in the south. the [[question]] of [[slavery]] was a [[question]] of
commerce and manufacture for the slave-owners in the north; for those of
the south, it is a [[question]] of [[life]] and [[death]]. [[god]] forbid that i should
seek to justify the [[principle]] of negro [[slavery]], as has been done by
some american writers! but i only observe that all the countries [[country]] which
formerly adopted that execrable [[principle]] are not equally able to
abandon it at the [[present]] [[time]].

when i contemplate the condition of the south, i can only discover two
alternatives which may be adopted by the [[white]] inhabitants of those
states; viz., either to emancipate the negroes, and to intermingle
with them; or, remaining isolated from them, to keep them in a [[state]] of
slavery as long as possible. all intermediate measures seem to me likely
to terminate, and that shortly, in the most horrible of civil wars [[war]], and
perhaps in the extirpation of one or other of the two races [[race]]. such is the
view which the americans of the south take of the [[question]], and they
act consistently with it. as they are determined not to mingle with the
negroes, they refuse to emancipate them.


not that the inhabitants of the south regard [[slavery]] as necessary to the
wealth of the planter, for on this point many of them agree with their
northern countrymen in freely admitting that [[slavery]] is prejudicial to
their interest; but they are convinced that, however prejudicial it may
be, they hold their lives [[life]] upon no other tenure. the instruction which is
now diffused in the south has convinced the inhabitants that [[slavery]] is
injurious to the slave-owner, but it has also shown them, more clearly
than before, that no means [[exist]] of getting rid of its [[bad]] consequences.
hence arises a singular contrast; the more the utility of [[slavery]] is
contested, the more firmly is it established in the laws [[law]]; and whilst
the [[principle]] of servitude is gradually abolished in the north, that
self-same [[principle]] gives rise to more and more rigorous consequences in
the south.

the legislation of the southern states with regard to slaves [[slave]], presents
at the [[present]] day such unparalleled atrocities as suffice to show how
radically the laws [[law]] of [[humanity]] have been perverted, and to betray the
desperate position of the [[community]] in which that legislation has
been promulgated. the americans of this portion of the union have not,
indeed, augmented the hardships of [[slavery]]; they have, on the contrary,
bettered the physical condition of the slaves [[slave]]. the only means by which
the ancients maintained [[slavery]] were fetters and [[death]]; the americans of
the south of the union have discovered more intellectual securities
for the duration of their [[power]]. they have employed their despotism and
their [[violence]] against the [[human]] [[mind]]. in antiquity, precautions were
taken to prevent the [[slave]] from breaking his chains; at the [[present]] day
measures are adopted to deprive him even of the [[desire]] of [[freedom]]. the
ancients kept the bodies [[body]] of their slaves [[slave]] in bondage, but they placed
no restraint upon the [[mind]] and no check upon [[education]]; and they
acted consistently with their established [[principle]], since a natural
termination of [[slavery]] then existed, and one day or other the slave
might be set [[free]], and become the [[equal]] of his master. but the americans
of the south, who do not admit that the negroes can ever be commingled
with themselves, have forbidden them to be taught to [[read]] or to write,
under severe penalties; and as they will not raise them to their own
level, they sink them as nearly as possible to that of the brutes.

the [[hope]] of [[liberty]] had always been allowed to the [[slave]] to cheer the
hardships of his condition. but the americans of the south are well
aware that emancipation cannot but be dangerous, when the freed [[man]] can
never be assimilated to his former master. to give a [[man]] his [[freedom]],
and to leave him in wretchedness and ignominy, is nothing less than to
prepare a future [[chief]] for a revolt of the slaves [[slave]]. moreover, it has long
been remarked that the presence of a [[free]] negro vaguely agitates the
minds of his less fortunate brethren [[brother]], and conveys to them a dim notion
of their rights [[right]]. the americans of the south have consequently taken
measures to prevent slave-owners from emancipating their slaves [[slave]] in most
cases; not indeed by a positive prohibition, but by subjecting that step
to various forms which it is difficult to comply with. i happened
to meet with an old [[man]], in the south of the union, who had lived in
illicit intercourse with one of his negresses, and had had several
children by her, who were born the slaves [[slave]] of their [[father]]. he had indeed
frequently [[thought]] of bequeathing to them at least their [[liberty]]; but
years had elapsed without his being able to surmount the legal obstacles
to their emancipation, and in the mean while his old [[age]] was come, and
he was about to [[die]]. he pictured to himself his sons [[son]] dragged from market
to market, and passing from the [[authority]] of a parent to the rod of
the stranger, until these horrid anticipations worked his expiring
imagination into frenzy. when i saw him he was a prey to all the anguish
of despair, and he made me [[feel]] how awful is the retribution of nature
upon those who have broken her laws [[law]].

these evils [[evil]] are unquestionably [[great]]; but they are the necessary and
foreseen consequence of the very [[principle]] of [[modern]] [[slavery]]. when the
europeans chose their slaves [[slave]] from a [[race]] differing from their own, which
many of them considered as inferior to the other races [[race]] of [[mankind]],
and which they all repelled with [[horror]] from any notion of intimate
connection, they must have believed that [[slavery]] would [[last]] forever;
since there is no intermediate [[state]] which can be durable between the
excessive inequality produced by servitude and the complete equality
which originates in independence. the europeans [[european]] did imperfectly feel
this [[truth]], but without acknowledging it even to themselves. whenever
they have had to do with negroes, their conduct has either been dictated
by their interest and their [[pride]], or by their compassion. they first
violated every [[right]] of [[humanity]] by their treatment of the negro
and they afterwards informed him that those rights [[right]] were precious and
inviolable. they affected to open their ranks to the slaves [[slave]], but the
negroes who attempted to penetrate into the [[community]] were driven back
with scorn; and they have incautiously and involuntarily been [[led]] to
admit of [[freedom]] instead of [[slavery]], without having the [[courage]] to be
wholly iniquitous, or wholly just.

if it be impossible to anticipate a period at which the americans of the
south will mingle their [[blood]] with that of the negroes, can they allow
their slaves [[slave]] to become [[free]] without compromising their own security? and
if they are obliged to keep that [[race]] in bondage in order to save their
own families [[family]], may they not be excused for availing themselves of the
means [[best]] adapted to that end? the events which are taking place in
the southern states of the union appear to me to be at once the most
horrible and the most [[natural]] results of [[slavery]]. when i see the order
of [[nature]] overthrown, and when i hear the cry of [[humanity]] in its vain
struggle against the laws [[law]], my indignation does not [[light]] upon the [[men]] of
our own [[time]] who are the instruments of these outrages; but i reserve
my execration for those who, after a thousand years of [[freedom]], brought
back [[slavery]] into the [[world]] once more.

whatever may be the efforts of the americans of the south to maintain
slavery, they will not always succeed. [[slavery]], which is now confined to
a [[single]] tract of the civilized [[earth]], which is attacked by christianity
as [[unjust]], and by [[political]] economy as prejudicial; and which is now
contrasted with democratic liberties [[liberty]] and the information of our [[age]],
cannot survive. by the [[choice]] of the master, or by the will of the
slave, it will cease; and in either case [[great]] calamities may be
expected to ensue. if [[liberty]] be refused to the negroes of the south,
they will in the end seize it for themselves by [[force]]; if it be given,
they will [[abuse]] it ere long. *x

[footnote x: [this [[chapter]] is no longer applicable to the condition of
the negro [[race]] in the [[united]] states, since the abolition of slavery
was the result, though not the object, of the [[great]] civil [[war]], and the
negroes have been raised to the condition not only of freedmen, but of
citizens; and in some states they exercise a preponderating political
power by [[reason]] of their numerical majority. thus, in south carolina
there were in 1870, 289,667 whites and 415,814 blacks. but the
emancipation of the slaves [[slave]] has not solved the problem, how two races [[race]] so
different and so hostile are to [[live]] together in [[peace]] in one [[country]] on
equal terms. that problem is as difficult, perhaps more difficult than
ever; and to this difficulty the author's remarks are still perfectly
applicable.]]




chapter xviii: future condition of three races--part vi

what are the chances [[chance]] in favor of the duration of the american union, and
what dangers threaten it *y

[footnote y: [this [[chapter]] is one of the most [[curious]] and interesting
portions of the [[work]], because it embraces almost all the constitutional
and social questions [[question]] which were raised by the [[great]] secession of the
south and decided by the results of the civil [[war]]. but it must be
confessed that the sagacity of the author is sometimes at [[fault]] in these
speculations, and did not save him from considerable errors, which the
course of events has since made apparent. he held that "the legislators
of the [[constitution]] of 1789 were not appointed to constitute the
government of a [[single]] [[people]], but to regulate the association of
several states; that the union was formed by the voluntary agreement
of the states, and in uniting together they have not forfeited their
nationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the
same [[people]]." whence he inferred that "if one of the states chose to
withdraw its name from the contract, it would be difficult to disprove
its [[right]] of doing so; and that the federal [[government]] would have no
means of maintaining its claims directly, either by [[force]] or by [[right]]."
this is the southern theory of the [[constitution]], and the whole case of
the south in favor of secession. to many europeans [[european]], and to some
american (northern) jurists, this view appeared to be sound; but it was
vigorously resisted by the north, and crushed by [[force]] of arms.

the author of this [[book]] was mistaken in supposing that the "union was a
vast [[body]] which presents [[present]] no definite object to patriotic feeling." when
the day of [[trial]] came, millions of [[men]] were ready to lay down their
lives for it. he was also mistaken in supposing that the federal
executive is so [[weak]] that it requires the [[free]] [[consent]] of the governed
to enable it to subsist, and that it would be defeated in a struggle
to maintain the union against one or more separate states. in 1861 nine
states, with a [[population]] of 8,753,000, seceded, and maintained for four
years a resolute but unequal contest for independence, but they were
defeated.

lastly, the author was mistaken in supposing that a [[community]] of
interests would always prevail between north and south sufficiently
powerful to bind them together. he overlooked the influence which the
question of [[slavery]] must have on the union the moment that the majority
of the [[people]] of the north declared against it. in 1831, when the author
visited [[america]], the anti-slavery agitation had scarcely begun; and the
fact of southern [[slavery]] was accepted by [[men]] of all parties, even in the
states where there were no slaves [[slave]]: and that was unquestionably the view
taken by all the states and by all american statesmen at the [[time]] of the
adoption of the [[constitution]], in 1789. but in the course of thirty years
a [[great]] [[change]] took place, and the north refused to perpetuate what had
become the "peculiar institution" of the south, especially as it gave
the south a [[species]] of aristocratic preponderance. the result was the
ratification, in december, 1865, of the celebrated 13th article or
amendment of the [[constitution]], which declared that "neither [[slavery]] nor
involuntary servitude--except as a [[punishment]] for crime--shall exist
within the [[united]] states." to which was soon afterwards added the 15th
article, "the [[right]] of [[citizens]] to vote shall not be denied or abridged
by the [[united]] states, or by any [[state]], on account of [[race]], color, or
previous servitude." the emancipation of several millions of negro
slaves without compensation, and the transfer to them of political
preponderance in the states in which they outnumber the white
population, were acts of the north totally opposed to the interests
of the south, and which could only have been carried into effect by
conquest.--translator's note.]]

reason for which the preponderating [[force]] lies [[lie]] in the states rather than
in the union--the union will only [[last]] as long as all the states choose
to belong to it--causes which tend to keep them united--utility of
the union to resist [[foreign]] enemies [[enemy]], and to prevent the existence
of foreigners in america--no [[natural]] barriers between the several
states--no conflicting interests to divide them--reciprocal interests
of the northern, southern, and western states--intellectual ties of
union--uniformity of opinions--dangers of the union resulting from the
different characters [[character]] and the [[passions]] of its citizens--character of the
citizens in the south and in the north--the rapid [[growth]] of the
union one of its [[greatest]] dangers--progress of the [[population]] to the
northwest--power gravitates in the same direction--passions originating
from sudden turns of fortune--whether the existing [[government]] of the
union tends to gain [[strength]], or to lose it--various signs of its
decrease--internal improvements--waste lands--indians--the bank--the
tariff--general jackson.

the maintenance of the existing [[institutions]] of the several states
depends in some measure upon the maintenance of the union itself. it is
therefore important in the first instance to inquire into the probable
fate of the union. one point may indeed be assumed at once: if
the [[present]] confederation were dissolved, it appears to me to be
incontestable that the states of which it is now composed would not
return to their original isolated condition, but that several unions
would then be formed in the place of one. it is not my intention to
inquire into the principles [[principle]] upon which these new unions would probably
be established, but merely to show what the causes are which may effect
the dismemberment of the existing confederation.

with this object i shall be obliged to retrace some of the steps which
i have already taken, and to revert to topics which i have before
discussed. i am aware that the reader may accuse me of repetition, but
the importance of the matter which still remains to be treated is my
excuse; i had rather say too much, than say too little to be thoroughly
understood, and i prefer injuring the author to slighting the [[subject]].

the legislators who formed the [[constitution]] of 1789 endeavored to confer
a distinct and preponderating [[authority]] upon the federal [[power]]. but they
were confined by the conditions of the task which they had undertaken
to perform. they were not appointed to constitute the [[government]] of a
single [[people]], but to regulate the association of several states; and,
whatever their inclinations might be, they could not but divide the
exercise of sovereignty in the end.

in order to [[understand]] the consequences of this division, it is
necessary to make a short distinction between the affairs of the
government. there are some objects which are national by their very
nature, that is to say, which affect the nation as a [[body]], and can
only be intrusted to the [[man]] or the assembly of [[men]] who most completely
represent the entire nation. amongst these may be reckoned [[war]] and
diplomacy. there are other objects which are provincial by their very
nature, that is to say, which only affect [[certain]] localities, and which
can only be properly treated in that locality. such, for instance, is
the budget of a municipality. lastly, there are [[certain]] objects of
a mixed [[nature]], which are national inasmuch as they affect all the
citizens who compose the nation, and which are provincial inasmuch as
it is not necessary that the nation itself should provide for them all.
such are the rights [[right]] which regulate the civil and [[political]] condition of
the [[citizens]]. no [[society]] can [[exist]] without civil and [[political]] rights [[right]].
these rights [[right]] therefore interest all the [[citizens]] alike; but it is not
always necessary to the existence and the [[prosperity]] of the nation that
these rights [[right]] should be uniform, nor, consequently, that they should be
regulated by the central [[authority]].

there are, then, two distinct categories of objects which are submitted
to the direction of the [[sovereign]] [[power]]; and these categories occur in
all well-constituted communities [[community]], whatever the basis of the political
constitution may otherwise be. between these two extremes the objects
which i have termed mixed may be considered to [[lie]]. as these objects
are neither exclusively national nor entirely provincial, they may be
obtained by a national or by a provincial [[government]], according to the
agreement of the contracting parties, without in any way impairing the
contract of association.

the [[sovereign]] [[power]] is usually formed by the union of separate
individuals, who compose a [[people]]; and [[individual]] powers [[power]] or collective
forces, each representing a very small portion of the sovereign
authority, are the sole elements which are subjected to the general
government of their [[choice]]. in this case the general [[government]] is more
naturally called upon to regulate, not only those affairs which are
of essential national importance, but those which are of a more local
interest; and the local governments [[government]] are reduced to that small share of
sovereign [[authority]] which is indispensable to their [[prosperity]].

but sometimes the [[sovereign]] [[authority]] is composed of preorganized
political bodies [[body]], by [[virtue]] of circumstances anterior to their union;
and in this case the provincial governments [[government]] assume the control, not only
of those affairs which more peculiarly belong to their province, but of
all, or of a part of the mixed affairs to which allusion has been made.
for the confederate nations which were independent [[sovereign]] states
before their union, and which still represent a very considerable share
of the [[sovereign]] [[power]], have only consented to cede to the general
government the exercise of those rights [[right]] which are indispensable to the
union.

when the national [[government]], independently of the prerogatives inherent
in its [[nature]], is invested with the [[right]] of regulating the affairs
which relate partly to the general and partly to the local interests,
it possesses a preponderating influence. not only are its own rights
extensive, but all the rights [[right]] which it does not possess [[exist]] by its
sufferance, and it may be apprehended that the provincial governments
may be deprived of their [[natural]] and necessary prerogatives by its
influence.

when, on the other hand, the provincial governments [[government]] are invested
with the [[power]] of regulating those same affairs of mixed interest, an
opposite tendency prevails in [[society]]. the preponderating [[force]] resides
in the province, not in the nation; and it may be apprehended that the
national [[government]] may in the end be stripped of the privileges [[privilege]] which
are necessary to its existence.

independent nations have therefore a [[natural]] tendency to centralization,
and confederations to dismemberment.

it now only remains for us to apply these general principles [[principle]] to the
american union. the several states were necessarily possessed of the
right of regulating all exclusively provincial affairs. moreover these
same states retained the rights [[right]] of determining the civil and political
competency of the [[citizens]], or regulating the reciprocal relations of
the members of the [[community]], and of dispensing [[justice]]; rights [[right]] which
are of a general [[nature]], but which do not necessarily appertain to the
national [[government]]. we have shown that the [[government]] of the union is
invested with the [[power]] of acting in the name of the whole nation in
those cases in which the nation has to appear as a [[single]] and undivided
power; as, for instance, in [[foreign]] relations, and in offering a common
resistance to a [[common]] [[enemy]]; in short, in conducting those affairs
which i have styled exclusively national.

in this division of the rights [[right]] of sovereignty, the share of the union
seems at first sight to be more considerable than that of the states;
but a more attentive investigation shows it to be less so. the
undertakings of the [[government]] of the union are more vast, but their
influence is more rarely [[felt]]. those of the provincial governments [[government]] are
comparatively small, but they are incessant, and they serve to keep
alive the [[authority]] which they represent. the [[government]] of the union
watches the general interests of the [[country]]; but the general interests
of a [[people]] have a very questionable influence upon individual
happiness, whilst provincial interests [[produce]] a most immediate effect
upon the welfare of the inhabitants. the union secures the independence
and the greatness of the nation, which do not immediately affect private
citizens; but the several states maintain the [[liberty]], regulate the
rights, [[protect]] the [[fortune]], and secure the [[life]] and the whole future
prosperity of every citizen.

the federal [[government]] is very far removed from its subjects [[subject]], whilst the
provincial governments [[government]] are within the reach of them all, and are ready
to attend to the smallest appeal. the central [[government]] has upon its
side the [[passions]] of a few superior [[men]] who aspire to conduct it; but
upon the side of the provincial governments [[government]] are the interests of all
those second-rate individuals [[individual]] who can only [[hope]] to obtain [[power]] within
their own [[state]], and who nevertheless exercise the largest share of
authority over the [[people]] because they are placed nearest to its level.
the americans have therefore much more to [[hope]] and to [[fear]] from the
states than from the union; and, in conformity with the [[natural]] tendency
of the [[human]] [[mind]], they are more likely to attach themselves to the
former than to the latter. in this [[respect]] their habits and feelings
harmonize with their interests.


when a compact nation divides its sovereignty, and adopts a confederate
form of [[government]], the traditions, the customs, and the manners of the
people are for a long [[time]] at variance with their legislation; and the
former tend to give a [[degree]] of influence to the central government
which the latter forbids. when a number of confederate states unite to
form a [[single]] nation, the same causes operate in an opposite direction.
i have no [[doubt]] that if [[france]] were to become a confederate republic
like that of the [[united]] states, the [[government]] would at first display
more energy than that of the union; and if the union were to alter
its [[constitution]] to a [[monarchy]] like that of [[france]], i [[think]] that the
american [[government]] would be a long [[time]] in acquiring the force
which now rules [[rule]] the latter nation. when the national existence of the
anglo-americans began, their provincial existence was already of long
standing; necessary relations were established between the townships and
the [[individual]] [[citizens]] of the same states; and they were accustomed
to consider some objects as [[common]] to them all, and to conduct other
affairs as exclusively relating to their own special interests.

the union is a vast [[body]] which presents [[present]] no definite object to
patriotic feeling. the forms and limits of the [[state]] are distinct and
circumscribed; since it represents a [[certain]] number of objects which are
familiar to the [[citizens]] and beloved by all. it is identified with the
very soil, with the [[right]] of [[property]] and the domestic affections, with
the recollections of the [[past]], the labors of the [[present]], and the hopes
of the future. [[patriotism]], then, which is frequently a mere extension of
individual egotism, is still directed to the [[state]], and is not excited
by the union. thus the tendency of the interests, the habits, and the
feelings of the [[people]] is to centre [[political]] activity in the states, in
preference to the union.

it is easy to estimate the different forces [[force]] of the two governments [[government]], by
remarking the manner in which they fulfil their respective functions.
whenever the [[government]] of a [[state]] has [[occasion]] to address an individual
or an assembly of individuals [[individual]], its [[language]] is clear and imperative; and
such is also the tone of the federal [[government]] in its intercourse with
individuals, but no sooner has it anything to do with a [[state]] than it
begins to parley, to explain its motives and to justify its conduct, to
argue, to advise, and, in short, anything but to command. if doubts [[doubt]] are
raised as to the limits of the constitutional powers [[power]] of each [[government]],
the provincial [[government]] prefers its claim with boldness, and takes
prompt and energetic steps to support it. in the mean while the
government of the union reasons [[reason]]; it appeals to the interests, to the
good sense, to the [[glory]] of the nation; it temporizes, it negotiates,
and does not [[consent]] to act until it is reduced to the [[last]] extremity.
at first sight it might readily be imagined that it is the provincial
government which is armed with the [[authority]] of the nation, and that
congress represents a [[single]] [[state]].

the federal [[government]] is, therefore, notwithstanding the precautions of
those who founded it, naturally so [[weak]] that it more peculiarly requires
the [[free]] [[consent]] of the governed to enable it to subsist. it is easy
to perceive that its object is to enable the states to realize with
facility their determination of remaining [[united]]; and, as long as this
preliminary condition exists, its [[authority]] is [[great]], temperate, and
effective. the [[constitution]] fits the [[government]] to control individuals [[individual]],
and easily to surmount such obstacles as they may be inclined to
offer; but it was by no means established with a view to the possible
separation of one or more of the states from the union.

if the sovereignty of the union were to engage in a struggle with
that of the states at the [[present]] day, its defeat may be confidently
predicted; and it is not probable that such a struggle would be
seriously undertaken. as often as a steady [[resistance]] is offered to the
federal [[government]] it will be found to yield. [[experience]] has hitherto
shown that whenever a [[state]] has demanded anything with perseverance
and resolution, it has invariably succeeded; and that if a separate
government has distinctly refused to act, it was left to do as it
thought fit. *z

[footnote z: see the conduct of the northern states in the [[war]] of 1812.
"during that [[war]]," says jefferson in a letter to general lafayette,
"four of the eastern states were only attached to the union, like so
many inanimate bodies [[body]] to living [[men]]."]

but even if the [[government]] of the union had any [[strength]] inherent in
itself, the physical situation of the [[country]] would render the exercise
of that [[strength]] very difficult. *a the [[united]] states cover an immense
territory; they are separated from each other by [[great]] distances; and
the [[population]] is disseminated over the surface of a [[country]] which is
still half a wilderness. if the union were to undertake to enforce the
allegiance of the confederate states by [[military]] means, it would be in
a position very analogous to that of [[england]] at the [[time]] of the [[war]] of
independence.

[footnote a: the profound [[peace]] of the union affords no pretext for a
standing [[army]]; and without a standing [[army]] a [[government]] is not prepared
to [[profit]] by a favorable opportunity to conquer [[resistance]], and take the
sovereign [[power]] by surprise. [this note, and the paragraph in the text
which precedes, have been shown by the results of the civil [[war]] to be a
misconception of the writer.]]

however [[strong]] a [[government]] may be, it cannot easily escape from the
consequences of a [[principle]] which it has once admitted as the foundation
of its [[constitution]]. the union was formed by the voluntary agreement
of the states; and, in uniting together, they have not forfeited their
nationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the
same [[people]]. if one of the states chose to withdraw its name from the
contract, it would be difficult to disprove its [[right]] of doing so; and
the federal [[government]] would have no means of maintaining its claims
directly, either by [[force]] or by [[right]]. in order to enable the federal
government easily to conquer the [[resistance]] which may be offered to it
by any one of its subjects [[subject]], it would be necessary that one or more of
them should be specially interested in the existence of the union, as
has frequently been the case in the [[history]] of confederations.

if it be supposed that amongst the states which are [[united]] by the
federal tie there are some which exclusively enjoy the principal
advantages of union, or whose [[prosperity]] depends on the duration of that
union, it is unquestionable that they will always be ready to support
the central [[government]] in enforcing the [[obedience]] of the others. but the
government would then be exerting a [[force]] not derived from itself, but
from a [[principle]] contrary to its [[nature]]. states form confederations in
order to derive [[equal]] advantages from their union; and in the case
just alluded to, the federal [[government]] would derive its [[power]] from the
unequal distribution of those benefits amongst the states.

if one of the confederate states have acquired a preponderance
sufficiently [[great]] to enable it to take exclusive possession of
the central [[authority]], it will consider the other states as subject
provinces, and it will cause its own [[supremacy]] to be respected under the
borrowed name of the sovereignty of the union. [[great]] things may then
be done in the name of the federal [[government]], but in reality that
government will have ceased to [[exist]]. *b in both these cases, the power
which acts in the name of the confederation becomes stronger the more
it abandons the [[natural]] [[state]] and the acknowledged principles [[principle]] of
confederations.

[footnote b: thus the province of holland in the [[republic]] of the low
countries, and the [[emperor]] in the germanic confederation, have sometimes
put themselves in the place of the union, and have employed the federal
authority to their own advantage.]

in [[america]] the existing union is advantageous to all the states, but it
is not indispensable to any one of them. several of them might break
the federal tie without compromising the welfare of the others, although
their own [[prosperity]] would be lessened. as the existence and the
happiness of none of the states are wholly dependent on the present
constitution, they would none of them be disposed to make [[great]] personal
sacrifices to maintain it. on the other hand, there is no [[state]] which
seems hitherto to have its [[ambition]] much interested in the maintenance
of the existing union. they certainly do not all exercise the same
influence in the federal councils, but no one of them can [[hope]] to
domineer over the rest, or to treat them as its inferiors or as its
subjects.

it appears to me unquestionable that if any portion of the union
seriously [[desired]] to separate itself from the other states, they would
not be able, nor indeed would they attempt, to prevent it; and that
the [[present]] union will only [[last]] as long as the states which compose
it choose to continue members of the confederation. if this point be
admitted, the [[question]] becomes less difficult; and our object is, not
to inquire whether the states of the existing union are capable of
separating, but whether they will choose to remain [[united]].

amongst the various reasons [[reason]] which tend to render the existing union
useful to the americans, two principal causes are peculiarly evident to
the observer. although the americans are, as it were, alone upon their
continent, their commerce makes them the neighbors of all the nations
with which they [[trade]]. notwithstanding their apparent isolation, the
americans require a [[certain]] [[degree]] of [[strength]], which they cannot retain
otherwise than by remaining [[united]] to each other. if the states were to
split, they would not only diminish the [[strength]] which they are now able
to display towards [[foreign]] nations, but they would soon create foreign
powers upon their own territory. a [[system]] of inland custom-houses would
then be established; the valleys would be divided by imaginary boundary
lines; the courses of the rivers would be confined by territorial
distinctions; and a multitude of hindrances would prevent the americans
from exploring the whole of that vast continent which providence has
allotted to them for a dominion. at [[present]] they have no [[invasion]] to
fear, and consequently no standing armies [[army]] to maintain, no taxes to levy.
if the union were dissolved, all these burdensome measures might ere
long be required. the americans are then very powerfully interested
in the maintenance of their union. on the other hand, it is almost
impossible to discover any sort of material interest which might at
present tempt a portion of the union to separate from the other states.

when we cast our [[eyes]] upon the map of the [[united]] states, we perceive
the chain of the alleghany mountains, running from the northeast to the
southwest, and crossing nearly one thousand miles of [[country]]; and we are
led to imagine that the design of providence was to raise between the
valley of the mississippi and the coast of the atlantic ocean one of
those [[natural]] barriers which break the mutual intercourse of [[men]], and
form the necessary limits of different states. but the average height of
the alleghanies does not exceed 2,500 feet; their [[greatest]] elevation is
not above 4,000 feet; their rounded summits, and the spacious valleys
which they conceal within their passes, are of easy access from several
sides. besides which, the principal rivers which fall into the atlantic
ocean--the hudson, the susquehanna, and the potomac--take their rise
beyond the alleghanies, in an open district, which borders upon the
valley of the mississippi. these streams quit this tract of [[country]],
make their way through the barrier which would seem to turn them
westward, and as they wind through the mountains they open an easy and
natural passage to [[man]]. no [[natural]] barrier exists in the regions which
are now inhabited by the anglo-americans; the alleghanies are so far
from serving as a boundary to separate nations, that they do not even
serve as a frontier to the states. new york, pennsylvania, and virginia
comprise them within their borders, and they extend as much to the
west as to the east of the line. the territory now occupied by the
twenty-four states of the union, and the three [[great]] districts which
have not yet acquired the rank of states, although they already contain
inhabitants, covers a surface of 1,002,600 square miles, *c which is
about [[equal]] to five times [[time]] the extent of [[france]]. within these limits the
qualities of the soil, the temperature, and the [[produce]] of the [[country]],
are extremely various. the vast extent of territory occupied by the
anglo-american republics [[republic]] has given rise to doubts [[doubt]] as to the maintenance
of their union. here a distinction must be made; contrary interests
sometimes arise in the different provinces of a vast [[empire]], which often
terminate in open dissensions; and the extent of the [[country]] is then
most prejudicial to the [[power]] of the [[state]]. but if the inhabitants of
these vast regions are not divided by contrary interests, the extent of
the territory may be favorable to their [[prosperity]]; for the unity of the
government promotes the interchange of the different productions of the
soil, and increases their value by facilitating their consumption.

[footnote c: see "darby's view of the [[united]] states," p. 435. [in 1890
the number of states and territories had increased to 51, the population
to 62,831,900, and the area of the states, 3,602,990 square miles.
this does not include the philippine islands, hawaii, or porto rico.
a conservative estimate of the [[population]] of the philippine islands is
8,000,000; that of hawaii, by the census of 1897, was given at 109,020;
and the [[present]] estimated [[population]] of porto rico is 900,000. the area
of the philippine islands is about 120,000 square miles, that of hawaii
is 6,740 square miles, and the area of porto rico is about 3,600 square
miles.]]

it is indeed easy to discover different interests in the different parts
of the union, but i am unacquainted with any which are hostile to each
other. the southern states are almost exclusively agricultural. the
northern states are more peculiarly commercial and manufacturing. the
states of the west are at the same [[time]] agricultural and manufacturing.
in the south the crops consist of tobacco, of rice, of cotton, and
of sugar; in the north and the west, of wheat and maize. these are
different sources of [[wealth]]; but union is the means by which these
sources are opened to all, and rendered equally advantageous to the
several districts.

the north, which ships the [[produce]] of the anglo-americans to all parts
of the [[world]], and brings back the [[produce]] of the globe to the union,
is evidently interested in maintaining the confederation in its present
condition, in order that the number of american producers and consumers
may remain as large as possible. the north is the most [[natural]] agent
of communication between the south and the west of the union on the one
hand, and the rest of the [[world]] upon the other; the north is therefore
interested in the union and [[prosperity]] of the south and the west,
in order that they may continue to furnish raw materials for its
manufactures, and cargoes for its shipping.

the south and the west, on their side, are still more directly
interested in the preservation of the union, and the [[prosperity]] of the
north. the [[produce]] of the south is, for the most part, exported
beyond seas; the south and the west consequently stand in need of the
commercial resources of the north. they are likewise interested in
the maintenance of a powerful fleet by the union, to [[protect]] them
efficaciously. the south and the west have no vessels, but they cannot
refuse a willing subsidy to defray the expenses of the navy; for if the
fleets of [[europe]] were to blockade the ports of the south and the delta
of the mississippi, what would become of the rice of the carolinas, the
tobacco of virginia, and the sugar and cotton which grow in the valley
of the mississippi? every portion of the federal budget does therefore
contribute to the maintenance of material interests which are [[common]] to
all the confederate states.

independently of this commercial utility, the south and the west of the
union derive [[great]] [[political]] advantages from their connection with the
north. the south contains an enormous [[slave]] [[population]]; a population
which is already alarming, and still more formidable for the future. the
states of the west [[lie]] in the remotest parts of a [[single]] valley; and all
the rivers which intersect their territory rise in the rocky mountains
or in the alleghanies, and fall into the mississippi, which bears them
onwards to the gulf of mexico. the western states are consequently
entirely cut off, by their position, from the traditions of [[europe]] and
the [[civilization]] of the old [[world]]. the inhabitants of the south, then,
are induced to support the union in order to avail themselves of its
protection against the blacks; and the inhabitants of the west in order
not to be excluded from a [[free]] communication with the rest of the globe,
and shut up in the wilds of central [[america]]. the north cannot but desire
the maintenance of the union, in order to remain, as it now is, the
connecting link between that vast [[body]] and the other parts of the [[world]].

the temporal interests of all the several parts of the union are, then,
intimately connected; and the same assertion holds true respecting those
opinions and sentiments which may be termed the immaterial interests of
men.




chapter xviii: future condition of three races--part vii

the inhabitants of the [[united]] states talk a [[great]] deal of their
attachment to their [[country]]; but i confess that i do not rely upon
that calculating [[patriotism]] which is founded upon interest, and which
a [[change]] in the interests at stake may obliterate. nor do i attach much
importance to the [[language]] of the americans, when they manifest, in
their daily conversations, the intention of maintaining the federal
system adopted by their forefathers. a [[government]] retains its sway
over a [[great]] number of [[citizens]], far less by the voluntary and rational
consent of the multitude, than by that instinctive, and to a certain
extent involuntary agreement, which results from similarity of feelings
and resemblances of [[opinion]]. i will never admit that [[men]] constitute a
social [[body]], simply because they obey the same head and the same laws [[law]].
society can only [[exist]] when a [[great]] number of [[men]] consider a great
number of things in the same point of view; when they hold the same
opinions upon many subjects [[subject]], and when the same occurrences suggest the
same thoughts [[thought]] and impressions to their minds [[mind]].

the observer who examines the [[present]] condition of the [[united]] states
upon this [[principle]], will readily discover, that although the citizens
are divided into twenty-four distinct sovereignties, they nevertheless
constitute a [[single]] [[people]]; and he may perhaps be [[led]] to [[think]] that the
state of the anglo-american union is more truly a [[state]] of [[society]] than
that of [[certain]] nations of [[europe]] which [[live]] under the same legislation
and the same [[prince]].

although the anglo-americans have several [[religious]] sects, they all
regard [[religion]] in the same manner. they are not always agreed upon the
measures which are most conducive to [[good]] [[government]], and they vary upon
some of the forms of [[government]] which it is expedient to adopt; but
they are unanimous upon the general principles [[principle]] which ought to rule
human [[society]]. from maine to the floridas, and from the missouri to the
atlantic ocean, the [[people]] is held to be the legitimate source of all
power. the same notions are entertained respecting [[liberty]] and equality,
the [[liberty]] of the press, the [[right]] of association, the jury, and the
responsibility of the agents of [[government]].

if we turn from their [[political]] and [[religious]] opinions [[opinion]] to the [[moral]] and
philosophical principles [[principle]] which regulate the daily actions of [[life]] and
govern their conduct, we shall still find the same uniformity. the
anglo-americans *d acknowledge the absolute [[moral]] [[authority]] of the
reason of the [[community]], as they acknowledge the [[political]] [[authority]] of
the mass of [[citizens]]; and they hold that [[public]] [[opinion]] is the surest
arbiter of what is lawful or forbidden, true or false. the majority
of them [[believe]] that a [[man]] will be [[led]] to do what is just and [[good]] by
following his own interest rightly understood. they hold that every man
is born in possession of the [[right]] of self-government, and that no one
has the [[right]] of constraining his fellow-creatures to be [[happy]]. they
have all a lively [[faith]] in the perfectibility of [[man]]; they are of
opinion that the effects of the diffusion of [[knowledge]] must necessarily
be advantageous, and the consequences of ignorance fatal; they all
consider [[society]] as a [[body]] in a [[state]] of improvement, [[humanity]] as a
changing scene, in which nothing is, or ought to be, permanent; and they
admit that what appears to them to be [[good]] to-day may be superseded by
something better-to-morrow. i do not give all these opinions [[opinion]] as true,
but i quote them as characteristic of the americans.

[footnote d: it is scarcely necessary for me to observe that by the
expression anglo-americans, i only mean to designate the [[great]] majority
of the nation; for a [[certain]] number of isolated individuals [[individual]] are of
course to be met with holding very different opinions [[opinion]].]

the anglo-americans are not only [[united]] together by these common
opinions, but they are separated from all other nations by a common
feeling of [[pride]]. for the [[last]] fifty years no pains [[pain]] have been spared to
convince the inhabitants of the [[united]] states that they constitute the
only [[religious]], enlightened, and [[free]] [[people]]. they perceive that, for
the [[present]], their own democratic [[institutions]] succeed, whilst those
of other countries [[country]] fail; hence they conceive an overweening opinion
of their superiority, and they are not very remote from believing
themselves to belong to a distinct [[race]] of [[mankind]].

the dangers which threaten the american union do not originate in the
diversity of interests or of opinions [[opinion]], but in the various characters [[character]] and
passions of the americans. the [[men]] who inhabit the vast territory of
the [[united]] states are almost all the issue of a [[common]] stock; but the
effects of the [[climate]], and more especially of [[slavery]], have gradually
introduced very striking differences between the british settler of the
southern states and the british settler of the north. in [[europe]] it is
generally believed that [[slavery]] has rendered the interests of one
part of the union contrary to those of another part; but i by no means
remarked this to be the case: [[slavery]] has not created interests in the
south contrary to those of the north, but it has modified the character
and changed the habits of the natives of the south.

i have already explained the influence which [[slavery]] has exercised upon
the commercial ability of the americans in the south; and this same
influence equally extends to their manners. the [[slave]] is a servant who
never remonstrates, and who submits to everything without complaint. he
may sometimes assassinate, but he never withstands, his master. in the
south there are no families [[family]] so [[poor]] as not to have slaves [[slave]]. the citizen
of the southern states of the union is invested with a sort of domestic
dictatorship, from his earliest years; the first notion he acquires
in [[life]] is that he is born to command, and the first habit which he
contracts is that of being obeyed without [[resistance]]. his education
tends, then, to give him the [[character]] of a supercilious and a hasty
man; irascible, [[violent]], and ardent in his desires [[desire]], impatient of
obstacles, but easily discouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first
attempt.

the american of the northern states is surrounded by no slaves [[slave]] in
his [[childhood]]; he is even unattended by [[free]] servants, and is usually
obliged to provide for his own wants. no sooner does he enter the world
than the [[idea]] of necessity assails him on every side: he soon learns
to [[know]] exactly the [[natural]] limit of his [[authority]]; he never expects to
subdue those who withstand him, by [[force]]; and he knows [[know]] that the surest
means of obtaining the support of his fellow-creatures, is to [[win]] their
favor. he therefore becomes patient, reflecting, tolerant, slow to act,
and persevering in his designs.

in the southern states the more immediate wants of [[life]] are always
supplied; the inhabitants of those parts are not busied in the material
cares of [[life]], which are always provided for by others; and their
imagination is diverted to more captivating and less definite objects.
the american of the south is fond of grandeur, luxury, and renown, of
gayety, of [[pleasure]], and above all of idleness; nothing obliges him
to exert himself in order to subsist; and as he has no necessary
occupations, he gives way to indolence, and does not even attempt what
would be useful.

but the equality of fortunes [[fortune]], and the absence of [[slavery]] in the north,
plunge the inhabitants in those same cares [[care]] of daily [[life]] which are
disdained by the [[white]] [[population]] of the south. they are taught from
infancy to combat want, and to place comfort above all the pleasures
of the [[intellect]] or the [[heart]]. the [[imagination]] is extinguished by the
trivial details of [[life]], and the ideas [[idea]] become less numerous and less
general, but far more practical and more precise. as [[prosperity]] is
the sole aim of exertion, it is excellently well attained; [[nature]] and
mankind are turned to the [[best]] pecuniary advantage, and [[society]] is
dexterously made to contribute to the welfare of each of its members,
whilst [[individual]] egotism is the source of general [[happiness]].

the citizen of the north has not only [[experience]], but [[knowledge]]:
nevertheless he sets but little value upon the pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[knowledge]];
he esteems it as the means of attaining a [[certain]] end, and he is only
anxious to seize its more lucrative applications. the citizen of the
south is more given to act upon impulse; he is more clever, more frank,
more generous, more intellectual, and more brilliant. the former, with
a greater [[degree]] of activity, of common-sense, of information, and of
general aptitude, has the characteristic [[good]] and [[evil]] qualities of
the middle classes. the latter has the tastes, the prejudices, the
weaknesses, and the magnanimity of all aristocracies. if two [[men]] are
united in [[society]], who have the same interests, and to a [[certain]] extent
the same opinions [[opinion]], but different characters [[character]], different acquirements, and
a different style of [[civilization]], it is probable that these [[men]] will
not agree. the same remark is applicable to a [[society]] of nations.
slavery, then, does not attack the american union directly in its
interests, but indirectly in its manners.

[footnote e: census of 1790, 3,929,328; 1830, 12,856,165; 1860,
31,443,321; 1870, 38,555,983; 1890, 62,831,900.]

the states which gave their assent to the federal contract in 1790 were
thirteen in number; the union now consists of thirty-four members. the
population, which amounted to nearly 4,000,000 in 1790, had more than
tripled in the space of forty years; and in 1830 it amounted to nearly
13,000,000. *e changes [[change]] of such magnitude cannot take place without some
danger.

a [[society]] of nations, as well as a [[society]] of individuals [[individual]], derives its
principal chances [[chance]] of duration from the [[wisdom]] of its members, their
individual weakness, and their limited number. the americans who quit
the coasts of the atlantic ocean to plunge into the western wilderness,
are adventurers impatient of restraint, greedy of [[wealth]], and frequently
men expelled from the states in which they were born. when they arrive
in the deserts they are unknown to each other, and they have neither
traditions, [[family]] feeling, nor the [[force]] of [[example]] to check their
excesses. the [[empire]] of the laws [[law]] is feeble amongst them; that of
morality is still more powerless. the settlers who are constantly
peopling the valley of the mississippi are, then, in every [[respect]] very
inferior to the americans who inhabit the older parts of the union.
nevertheless, they already exercise a [[great]] influence in its councils;
and they arrive at the [[government]] of the commonwealth before they have
learnt to govern themselves. *f

[footnote f: this indeed is only a temporary danger. i have no doubt
that in [[time]] [[society]] will assume as much stability and regularity in the
west as it has already done upon the coast of the atlantic ocean.]

the greater the [[individual]] weakness of each of the contracting parties,
the greater are the chances [[chance]] of the duration of the contract; for their
safety is then dependent upon their union. when, in 1790, the most
populous of the american republics [[republic]] did not contain 500,000 inhabitants,
*g each of them [[felt]] its own insignificance as an independent [[people]],
and this feeling rendered compliance with the federal [[authority]] more
easy. but when one of the confederate states reckons, like the [[state]] of
new york, 2,000,000 of inhabitants, and covers an extent of territory
equal in surface to a quarter of [[france]], *h it feels [[feel]] its own [[strength]];
and although it may continue to support the union as advantageous to
its [[prosperity]], it no longer regards that [[body]] as necessary to its
existence, and as it continues to belong to the federal compact, it soon
aims at preponderance in the federal assemblies. the probable unanimity
of the states is diminished as their number increases. at [[present]] the
interests of the different parts of the union are not at variance; but
who is able to foresee the multifarious changes [[change]] of the future, in a
country in which towns are founded from day to day, and states almost
from year to year?

[footnote g: pennsylvania contained 431,373 inhabitants in 1790 [and
5,258,014 in 1890.]]

[footnote h: the area of the [[state]] of new york is 49,170 square miles.
[see u. s. census report of 1890.]]

since the first settlement of the british colonies, the number of
inhabitants has about doubled every twenty-two years. i perceive no
causes which are likely to check this progressive increase of the
anglo-american [[population]] for the next hundred years; and before
that space of [[time]] has elapsed, i [[believe]] that the territories
and dependencies of the [[united]] states will be covered by more than
100,000,000 of inhabitants, and divided into forty states. *i i admit
that these 100,000,000 of [[men]] have no hostile interests. i suppose,
on the contrary, that they are all equally interested in the maintenance
of the union; but i am still of [[opinion]] that where there are 100,000,000
of [[men]], and forty distinct nations, unequally [[strong]], the continuance of
the federal [[government]] can only be a fortunate accident.

[footnote i: if the [[population]] continues to double every twenty-two
years, as it has done for the [[last]] two hundred years, the number of
inhabitants in the [[united]] states in 1852 will be twenty millions; in
1874, forty-eight millions; and in 1896, ninety-six millions. this may
still be the case even if the lands [[land]] on the western slope of the rocky
mountains should be found to be unfit for cultivation. the territory
which is already occupied can easily contain this number of inhabitants.
one hundred millions of [[men]] disseminated over the surface of the
twenty-four states, and the three dependencies, which constitute the
union, would only give 762 inhabitants to the square league; this would
be far below the mean [[population]] of [[france]], which is 1,063 to the square
league; or of [[england]], which is 1,457; and it would even be below the
population of switzerland, for that [[country]], notwithstanding its lakes
and mountains, contains 783 inhabitants to the square league. see "malte
brun," vol. vi. p. 92.

[the actual result has fallen somewhat short of these calculations, in
spite of the vast territorial acquisitions of the [[united]] states: but in
1899 the [[population]] is probably about eighty-seven millions, including
the [[population]] of the philippines, hawaii, and porto rico.]]

whatever [[faith]] i may have in the perfectibility of [[man]], until human
nature is altered, and [[men]] wholly transformed, i shall refuse to believe
in the duration of a [[government]] which is called upon to hold together
forty different peoples [[people]], disseminated over a territory [[equal]] to one-half
of [[europe]] in extent; to avoid all rivalry, [[ambition]], and struggles
between them, and to direct their independent activity to the
accomplishment of the same designs.

but the [[greatest]] peril to which the union is exposed by its increase
arises from the continual changes [[change]] which take place in the position of
its internal [[strength]]. the distance from lake superior to the gulf of
mexico extends from the 47th to the 30th [[degree]] of latitude, a distance
of more than 1,200 miles as the bird flies. the frontier of the united
states winds along the whole of this immense line, sometimes falling
within its limits, but more frequently extending far beyond it, into the
waste. it has been calculated that the whites advance every year a mean
distance of seventeen miles along the whole of his vast boundary. *j
obstacles, such as an unproductive district, a lake or an [[indian]] nation
unexpectedly encountered, are sometimes met with. the advancing column
then halts for a while; its two extremities fall back upon themselves,
and as soon as they are reunited they proceed onwards. this gradual and
continuous [[progress]] of the [[european]] [[race]] towards the rocky mountains has
the solemnity of a providential event; it is like a deluge of [[men]] rising
unabatedly, and daily driven onwards by the hand of [[god]].

[footnote j: see legislative documents, 20th congress, no. 117, p. 105.]

within this first line of conquering settlers towns are built, and
vast states founded. in 1790 there were only a few thousand pioneers
sprinkled along the valleys of the mississippi; and at the [[present]] day
these valleys contain as many inhabitants as were to be found in the
whole union in 1790. their [[population]] amounts to nearly 4,000,000. *k
the [[city]] of washington was founded in 1800, in the very centre of the
union; but such are the changes [[change]] which have taken place, that it now
stands at one of the extremities; and the delegates of the most remote
western states are already obliged to perform a [[journey]] as long as that
from vienna to [[paris]]. *l

[footnote k: 3,672,317--census of 1830.]

[footnote l: the distance from jefferson, the [[capital]] of the [[state]] of
missouri, to washington is 1,019 miles. ("american almanac," 1831, p.
48.)]

all the states are borne onwards at the same [[time]] in the path of
fortune, but of course they do not all increase and [[prosper]] in the
same proportion. to the north of the union the detached branches of
the alleghany chain, which extend as far as the atlantic ocean, form
spacious roads and ports, which are constantly accessible to vessels
of the [[greatest]] burden. but from the potomac to the mouth of the
mississippi the coast is sandy and flat. in this part of the union the
mouths of almost all the rivers are obstructed; and the few harbors
which [[exist]] amongst these lagoons afford much shallower water to
vessels, and much fewer commercial advantages than those of the north.

this first [[natural]] cause of inferiority is [[united]] to another cause
proceeding from the laws [[law]]. we have already seen that [[slavery]], which is
abolished in the north, still exists in the south; and i have pointed
out its fatal consequences upon the [[prosperity]] of the planter himself.

the north is therefore superior to the south both in commerce *m and
manufacture; the [[natural]] consequence of which is the more rapid increase
of [[population]] and of [[wealth]] within its borders. the states situate upon
the shores of the atlantic ocean are already half-peopled. most of the
land is held by an owner; and these districts cannot therefore receive
so many emigrants as the western states, where a boundless field is
still open to their exertions. the valley of the mississippi is far more
fertile than the coast of the atlantic ocean. this [[reason]], added to all
the others, contributes to drive the europeans [[european]] westward--a [[fact]] which
may be rigorously demonstrated by figures. it is found that the sum
total of the [[population]] of all the [[united]] states has about tripled in
the course of forty years. but in the recent states adjacent to the
mississippi, the [[population]] has increased thirty-one-fold, within the
same space of [[time]]. *n

[footnote m: the following statements will suffice to show the
difference which exists between the commerce of the south and that of
the north:--

in 1829 the tonnage of all the merchant vessels belonging to virginia,
the two carolinas, and georgia (the four [[great]] southern states),
amounted to only 5,243 tons. in the same year the tonnage of the vessels
of the [[state]] of massachusetts alone amounted to 17,322 tons. (see
legislative documents, 21st congress, 2d session, no. 140, p. 244.) thus
the [[state]] of massachusetts had three times [[time]] as much shipping as the
four above-mentioned states. nevertheless the area of the [[state]] of
massachusetts is only 7,335 square miles, and its [[population]] amounts
to 610,014 inhabitants [2,238,943 in 1890]; whilst the area of the four
other states i have quoted is 210,000 square miles, and their population
3,047,767. thus the area of the [[state]] of massachusetts forms only
one-thirtieth part of the area of the four states; and its population
is five times [[time]] smaller than theirs. (see "darby's view of the united
states.") [[slavery]] is prejudicial to the commercial [[prosperity]] of the
south in several different ways; by diminishing the spirit of enterprise
amongst the whites, and by preventing them from meeting with as numerous
a class of sailors as they require. sailors are usually taken from the
lowest ranks of the [[population]]. but in the southern states these lowest
ranks are composed of slaves [[slave]], and it is very difficult to employ them at
sea. they are unable to serve as well as a [[white]] crew, and apprehensions
would always be entertained of their mutinying in the middle of the
ocean, or of their escaping in the [[foreign]] countries [[country]] at which they might
touch.]

[footnote n: "darby's view of the [[united]] states," p. 444.]

the relative position of the central federal [[power]] is continually
displaced. forty years ago the majority of the [[citizens]] of the union was
established upon the coast of the atlantic, in the environs of the spot
upon which washington now stands; but the [[great]] [[body]] of the people
is now advancing inland and to the north, so that in twenty years the
majority will unquestionably be on the western side of the alleghanies.
if the union goes on to subsist, the basin of the mississippi is
evidently marked out, by its fertility and its extent, as the future
centre of the federal [[government]]. in thirty or forty years, that tract
of [[country]] will have assumed the rank which naturally belongs to it. it
is easy to calculate that its [[population]], compared to that of the coast
of the atlantic, will be, in round numbers, as 40 to 11. in a few
years the states which founded the union will lose the direction of
its policy, and the [[population]] of the valley of the mississippi will
preponderate in the federal assemblies.

this constant gravitation of the federal [[power]] and influence towards
the northwest is shown every ten years, when a general census of the
population is made, and the number of delegates which each state
sends to congress is settled afresh. *o in 1790 virginia had nineteen
representatives in congress. this number continued to increase until the
year 1813, when it reached to twenty-three; from that [[time]] it began to
decrease, and in 1833 virginia elected only twenty-one representatives.
*p during the same period the [[state]] of new york progressed in the
contrary direction: in 1790 it had ten representatives in congress; in
1813, twenty-seven; in 1823, thirty-four; and in 1833, forty. the state
of ohio had only one representative in 1803, and in 1833 it had already
nineteen.

[footnote o: it may be seen that in the course of the [[last]] ten years
(1820-1830) the [[population]] of one district, as, for instance, the state
of delaware, has increased in the proportion of five per cent.; whilst
that of another, as the territory of michigan, has increased 250 per
cent. thus the [[population]] of virginia had augmented thirteen per cent.,
and that of the border [[state]] of ohio sixty-one per cent., in the same
space of [[time]]. the general table of these changes [[change]], which is given in the
"national calendar," displays a striking picture of the unequal fortunes
of the different states.]

[footnote p: it has just been said that in the course of the [[last]] term
the [[population]] of virginia has increased thirteen per cent.; and it is
necessary to explain how the number of representatives for a [[state]] may
decrease, when the [[population]] of that [[state]], far from diminishing, is
actually upon the increase. i take the [[state]] of virginia, to which
i have already alluded, as my term of comparison. the number of
representatives of virginia in 1823 was proportionate to the total
number of the representatives of the union, and to the relation which
the [[population]] bore to that of the whole union: in 1833 the number of
representatives of virginia was likewise proportionate to the total
number of the representatives of the union, and to the relation which
its [[population]], augmented in the course of ten years, bore to the
augmented [[population]] of the union in the same space of [[time]]. the new
number of virginian representatives will then be to the old numver, on
the one hand, as the new numver of all the representatives is to the old
number; and, on the other hand, as the augmentation of the [[population]] of
virginia is to that of the whole [[population]] of the [[country]]. thus, if
the increase of the [[population]] of the lesser [[country]] be to that of the
greater in an exact inverse ratio of the proportion between the new
and the old numbers of all the representatives, the number of the
representatives of virginia will remain stationary; and if the
increase of the virginian [[population]] be to that of the whole union in a
feeblerratio than the new number of the representatives of the union
to the old number, the number of the representatives of virginia
must decrease. [thus, to the 56th congress in 1899, virginia and west
virginia send only fourteen representatives.]]




chapter xviii: future condition of three races--part viii


it is difficult to imagine a durable union of a [[people]] which is [[rich]] and
strong with one which is [[poor]] and [[weak]], even if it were proved that the
strength and [[wealth]] of the one are not the causes of the weakness and
poverty of the other. but union is still more difficult to maintain at a
time at which one party is losing [[strength]], and the other is gaining it.
this rapid and disproportionate increase of [[certain]] states threatens
the independence of the others. new york might perhaps succeed, with its
2,000,000 of inhabitants and its forty representatives, in dictating to
the other states in congress. but even if the more powerful states make
no attempt to bear down the lesser ones, the danger still exists; for
there is almost as much in the possibility of the act as in the act
itself. the [[weak]] generally mistrust the [[justice]] and the [[reason]] of the
strong. the states which increase less rapidly than the others look upon
those which are more favored by [[fortune]] with envy and suspicion. hence
arise the deep-seated uneasiness and ill-defined agitation which are
observable in the south, and which form so striking a contrast to the
confidence and [[prosperity]] which are [[common]] to other parts of the union.
i am inclined to [[think]] that the hostile measures taken by the southern
provinces upon a recent [[occasion]] are attributable to no other cause. the
inhabitants of the southern states are, of all the americans, those
who are most interested in the maintenance of the union; they would
assuredly suffer most from being left to themselves; and yet they are
the only [[citizens]] who threaten to break the tie of confederation. but
it is easy to perceive that the south, which has given four presidents,
washington, jefferson, madison, and monroe, to the union, which
perceives that it is losing its federal influence, and that the number
of its representatives in congress is diminishing from year to year,
whilst those of the northern and western states are increasing; the
south, which is peopled with ardent and irascible beings, is becoming
more and more irritated and alarmed. the [[citizens]] reflect upon their
present position and [[remember]] their [[past]] influence, with the melancholy
uneasiness of [[men]] who suspect oppression: if they discover a [[law]] of
the union which is not unequivocally favorable to their interests,
they [[protest]] against it as an [[abuse]] of [[force]]; and if their ardent
remonstrances are not listened to, they threaten to quit an association
which loads them with burdens whilst it deprives them of their due
profits. "the tariff," said the inhabitants of carolina in 1832,
"enriches the north, and ruins the south; for if this were not the case,
to what can we attribute the continually increasing [[power]] and wealth
of the north, with its inclement skies [[sky]] and arid soil; whilst the south,
which may be styled the garden of [[america]], is rapidly declining?" *q

[footnote q: see the report of its committee to the convention which
proclaimed the nullification of the tariff in south carolina.]

if the changes [[change]] which i have described were gradual, so that each
generation at least might have [[time]] to disappear with the order of
things under which it had lived, the danger would be less; but the
progress of [[society]] in [[america]] is precipitate, and almost revolutionary.
the same citizen may have lived to see his [[state]] take the lead in the
union, and afterwards become powerless in the federal assemblies; and
an anglo-american [[republic]] has been known to grow as rapidly as a man
passing from birth and infancy to maturity in the course of thirty
years. it must not be imagined, however, that the states which lose
their preponderance, also lose their [[population]] or their riches [[rich]]: no stop
is put to their [[prosperity]], and they even go on to increase more
rapidly than any [[kingdom]] in [[europe]]. *r but they [[believe]] themselves to be
impoverished because their [[wealth]] does not augment as rapidly as that of
their neighbors; any they [[think]] that their [[power]] is lost, because they
suddenly come into collision with a [[power]] greater than their own: *s
thus they are more hurt in their feelings and their [[passions]] than
in their interests. but this is amply sufficient to endanger the
maintenance of the union. if kings [[king]] and peoples [[people]] had only had their true
interests in view ever since the beginning of the [[world]], the name of war
would scarcely be known among [[mankind]].

[footnote r: the [[population]] of a [[country]] assuredly constitutes the
first element of its [[wealth]]. in the ten years (1820-1830) during which
virginia lost two of its representatives in congress, its population
increased in the proportion of 13.7 per cent.; that of carolina in the
proportion of fifteen per cent.; and that of georgia, 15.5 per cent.
(see the "american almanac," 1832, p. 162) but the [[population]] of russia,
which increases more rapidly than that of any other [[european]] [[country]],
only augments in ten years at the rate of 9.5 per cent.; in [[france]], at
the rate of seven per cent.; and in [[europe]] in general, at the rate of
4.7 per cent. (see "malte brun," vol. vi. p. 95)]

[footnote s: it must be admitted, however, that the depreciation which
has taken place in the value of tobacco, during the [[last]] fifty years,
has notably diminished the opulence of the southern planters: but this
circumstance is as independent of the will of their northern brethren [[brother]] as
it is of their own.]

thus the [[prosperity]] of the [[united]] states is the source of the most
serious dangers that threaten them, since it tends to create in some of
the confederate states that over-excitement which accompanies a rapid
increase of [[fortune]]; and to awaken in others those feelings of envy,
mistrust, and regret which usually attend upon the loss of it. the
americans contemplate this extraordinary and hasty [[progress]] with
exultation; but they would be wiser to consider it with [[sorrow]] and
alarm. the americans of the [[united]] states must inevitably become one of
the [[greatest]] nations in the [[world]]; their offset will cover almost
the whole of north [[america]]; the continent which they inhabit is their
dominion, and it cannot escape them. what urges them to take possession
of it so soon? riches [[rich]], [[power]], and renown cannot fail to be theirs at
some future [[time]], but they rush upon their [[fortune]] as if but a moment
remained for them to make it their own.

i [[think]] that i have demonstrated that the existence of the present
confederation depends entirely on the continued assent of all the
confederates; and, starting from this [[principle]], i have inquired into
the causes which may induce the several states to separate from the
others. the union may, however, perish in two different ways: one of
the confederate states may choose to retire from the compact, and so
forcibly to sever the federal tie; and it is to this supposition that
most of the remarks that i have made apply: or the [[authority]] of
the federal [[government]] may be progressively entrenched on by the
simultaneous tendency of the [[united]] republics [[republic]] to resume their
independence. the central [[power]], successively stripped of all its
prerogatives, and reduced to impotence by tacit [[consent]], would become
incompetent to fulfil its [[purpose]]; and the second union would perish,
like the first, by a sort of senile inaptitude. the gradual weakening of
the federal tie, which may finally lead to the dissolution of the
union, is a distinct circumstance, that may [[produce]] a variety of minor
consequences before it operates so [[violent]] a [[change]]. the confederation
might still subsist, although its [[government]] were reduced to such
a [[degree]] of inanition as to paralyze the nation, to cause internal
anarchy, and to check the general [[prosperity]] of the [[country]].

after having investigated the causes which may induce the
anglo-americans to disunite, it is important to inquire whether, if the
union continues to subsist, their [[government]] will extend or contract
its sphere of action, and whether it will become more energetic or more
weak.


the americans are evidently disposed to look upon their future condition
with alarm. they perceive that in most of the nations of the [[world]] the
exercise of the rights [[right]] of sovereignty tends to fall under the control of
a few individuals [[individual]], and they are dismayed by the [[idea]] that such will also
be the case in their own [[country]]. even the statesmen [[feel]], or affect
to [[feel]], these fears [[fear]]; for, in [[america]], centralization is by no means
popular, and there is no surer means of courting the majority than by
inveighing against the encroachments of the central [[power]]. the americans
do not perceive that the countries [[country]] in which this alarming tendency to
centralization exists are inhabited by a [[single]] [[people]]; whilst the fact
of the union being composed of different confederate communities [[community]] is
sufficient to baffle all the inferences which might be drawn from
analogous circumstances. i confess that i am inclined to consider the
fears of a [[great]] number of americans as purely imaginary; and far from
participating in their dread of the consolidation of [[power]] in the hands
of the union, i [[think]] that the federal [[government]] is visibly losing
strength.

to prove this assertion i shall not have recourse to any remote
occurrences, but to circumstances which i have myself witnessed, and
which belong to our own [[time]].

an attentive examination of what is going on in the [[united]] states will
easily convince us that two opposite tendencies [[exist]] in that [[country]],
like two distinct currents flowing in contrary directions in the same
channel. the union has now existed for forty-five years, and in the
course of that [[time]] a vast number of provincial prejudices, which were
at first hostile to its [[power]], have died away. the patriotic feeling
which attached each of the americans to his own native [[state]] is become
less exclusive; and the different parts of the union have become more
intimately connected the [[better]] they have become acquainted with each
other. the post, *t that [[great]] instrument of intellectual intercourse,
now reaches into the backwoods; and steamboats have established daily
means of communication between the different points of the coast. an
inland navigation of unexampled rapidity conveys commodities up and down
the rivers of the [[country]]. *u and to these facilities of [[nature]] and art
may be added those restless cravings, that busy-mindedness, and love
of pelf, which are constantly urging the american into active [[life]],
and bringing him into contact with his fellow-citizens. he crosses the
country in every direction; he visits all the various populations of the
land; and there is not a province in [[france]] in which the natives are
so well known to each other as the 13,000,000 of [[men]] who cover the
territory of the [[united]] states.

[footnote t: in 1832, the district of michigan, which only contains
31,639 inhabitants, and is still an almost unexplored wilderness,
possessed 940 miles of mail-roads. the territory of arkansas, which
is still more uncultivated, was already intersected by 1,938 miles of
mail-roads. (see the report of the general post office, november 30,
1833.) the postage of newspapers alone in the whole union amounted to
$254,796.]

[footnote u: in the course of ten years, from 1821 to 1831, 271
steamboats have been launched upon the rivers which water the valley
of the mississippi alone. in 1829 259 steamboats existed in the united
states. (see legislative documents, no. 140, p. 274.)]

but whilst the americans intermingle, they grow in resemblance of each
other; the differences resulting from their [[climate]], their origin, and
their [[institutions]], diminish; and they all draw nearer and nearer to the
common type. every year, thousands of [[men]] leave the north to settle in
different parts of the union: they bring with them their [[faith]], their
opinions, and their manners; and as they are more enlighthned than the
men amongst whom they are about to dwell, they soon rise to the head of
affairs, and they adapt [[society]] to their own advantage. this continual
emigration of the north to the south is peculiarly favorable to the
fusion of all the different provincial characters [[character]] into one national
character. the [[civilization]] of the north appears to be the common
standard, to which the whole nation will one day be assimilated.

the commercial ties which unite the confederate states are strengthened
by the increasing manufactures of the americans; and the union which
began to [[exist]] in their opinions [[opinion]], gradually forms a part of their
habits: the course of [[time]] has swept away the bugbear thoughts [[thought]] which
haunted the imaginations [[imagination]] of the [[citizens]] in 1789. the federal power
is not become oppressive; it has not destroyed the independence of
the states; it has not subjected the confederates to monarchial
institutions; and the union has not rendered the lesser states dependent
upon the larger ones; but the confederation has continued to increase in
population, in [[wealth]], and in [[power]]. i am therefore convinced that the
natural obstacles to the continuance of the american union are not so
powerful at the [[present]] [[time]] as they were in 1789; and that the enemies
of the union are not so numerous.

nevertheless, a careful examination of the [[history]] of the [[united]] states
for the [[last]] forty-five years will readily convince us that the federal
power is declining; nor is it difficult to explain the causes of this
phenomenon. *v when the [[constitution]] of 1789 was promulgated, the
nation was a prey to [[anarchy]]; the union, which succeeded this confusion,
excited much dread and much animosity; but it was warmly supported
because it satisfied an imperious want. thus, although it was more
attacked than it is now, the federal [[power]] soon reached the maximum of
its [[authority]], as is usually the case with a [[government]] which triumphs
after having braced its [[strength]] by the struggle. at that [[time]] the
interpretation of the [[constitution]] seemed to extend, rather than to
repress, the federal sovereignty; and the union offered, in several
respects, the appearance of a [[single]] and undivided [[people]], directed in
its [[foreign]] and internal policy by a [[single]] [[government]]. but to attain
this point the [[people]] had risen, to a [[certain]] extent, above itself.


[footnote v: [since 1861 the movement is certainly in the opposite
direction, and the federal [[power]] has largely increased, and tends to
further increase.]]

the [[constitution]] had not destroyed the distinct sovereignty of the
states; and all communities [[community]], of whatever [[nature]] they may be, are
impelled by a secret propensity to assert their independence. this
propensity is still more decided in a [[country]] like [[america]], in which
every village forms a sort of [[republic]] accustomed to conduct its own
affairs. it therefore cost the states an effort to submit to the federal
supremacy; and all efforts, however successful they may be, necessarily
subside with the causes in which they originated.

as the federal [[government]] consolidated its [[authority]], [[america]] resumed
its rank amongst the nations, [[peace]] returned to its frontiers, and
public credit was restored; confusion was succeeded by a fixed [[state]] of
things, which was favorable to the full and [[free]] exercise of industrious
enterprise. it was this very [[prosperity]] which made the americans forget
the cause to which it was attributable; and when once the danger was
passed, the energy and the [[patriotism]] which had enabled them to brave
it disappeared from amongst them. no sooner were they delivered from the
cares which [[oppressed]] them, than they easily returned to their ordinary
habits, and gave themselves up without [[resistance]] to their natural
inclinations. when a powerful [[government]] no longer appeared to
be necessary, they once more began to [[think]] it irksome. the union
encouraged a general [[prosperity]], and the states were not inclined to
abandon the union; but they [[desired]] to render the action of the power
which represented that [[body]] as [[light]] as possible. the general principle
of union was adopted, but in every minor detail there was an actual
tendency to independence. the [[principle]] of confederation was every
day more easily admitted, and more rarely applied; so that the federal
government brought about its own decline, whilst it was creating order
and [[peace]].

as soon as this tendency of [[public]] [[opinion]] began to be manifested
externally, the leaders of parties, who [[live]] by the [[passions]] of the
people, began to [[work]] it to their own advantage. the position of the
federal [[government]] then became exceedingly critical. its enemies [[enemy]] were
in possession of the popular favor; and they obtained the [[right]] of
conducting its policy by pledging themselves to lessen its influence.
from that [[time]] forwards the [[government]] of the union has invariably been
obliged to recede, as often as it has attempted to enter the lists with
the governments [[government]] of the states. and whenever an interpretation of
the terms of the federal [[constitution]] has been called for, that
interpretation has most frequently been opposed to the union, and
favorable to the states.

the [[constitution]] invested the federal [[government]] with the [[right]] of
providing for the interests of the nation; and it had been held that no
other [[authority]] was so fit to superintend the "internal improvements"
which affected the [[prosperity]] of the whole union; such, for instance, as
the cutting of canals. but the states were alarmed at a [[power]],
distinct from their own, which could thus dispose of a portion of their
territory; and they were afraid that the central [[government]] would, by
this means, acquire a formidable extent of patronage within their own
confines, and exercise a [[degree]] of influence which they intended to
reserve exclusively to their own agents. the democratic party, which has
constantly been opposed to the increase of the federal [[authority]],
then accused the congress of usurpation, and the [[chief]] magistrate of
ambition. the central [[government]] was intimidated by the opposition;
and it soon acknowledged its error, promising exactly to confine its
influence for the future within the circle which was prescribed to it.

the [[constitution]] confers upon the union the [[right]] of treating with
foreign nations. the [[indian]] tribes, which border upon the frontiers of
the [[united]] states, had usually been regarded in this [[light]]. as long as
these savages consented to retire before the civilized settlers,
the federal [[right]] was not contested: but as soon as an [[indian]] tribe
attempted to fix its dwelling upon a given spot, the adjacent states
claimed possession of the lands [[land]] and the rights [[right]] of sovereignty over the
natives. the central [[government]] soon recognized both these claims; and
after it had concluded treaties with the indians [[indian]] as independent nations,
it gave them up as subjects [[subject]] to the legislative [[tyranny]] of the states. *w

[footnote w: see in the legislative documents, already quoted in
speaking of the indians [[indian]], the letter of the president of the united
states to the cherokees, his correspondence on this [[subject]] with his
agents, and his messages to congress.]

some of the states which had been founded upon the coast of the
atlantic, extended indefinitely to the west, into wild regions where no
european had ever penetrated. the states whose confines were irrevocably
fixed, looked with a [[jealous]] eye upon the unbounded regions which the
future would enable their neighbors to explore. the latter then agreed,
with a view to conciliate the others, and to facilitate the act
of union, to lay down their own boundaries, and to abandon all the
territory which lay beyond those limits to the confederation at large.
*x thenceforward the federal [[government]] became the owner of all the
uncultivated lands [[land]] which [[lie]] beyond the borders of the thirteen states
first confederated. it was invested with the [[right]] of parcelling and
selling them, and the sums derived from this source were exclusively
reserved to the [[public]] treasure of the union, in order to furnish
supplies for purchasing tracts of [[country]] from the indians [[indian]], for opening
roads to the remote settlements, and for accelerating the increase of
civilization as much as possible. new states have, however, been formed
in the course of [[time]], in the midst of those wilds which were formerly
ceded by the inhabitants of the shores of the atlantic. congress has
gone on to sell, for the [[profit]] of the nation at large, the uncultivated
lands which those new states contained. but the latter at length
asserted that, as they were now fully constituted, they ought to enjoy
the exclusive [[right]] of converting the [[produce]] of these sales to their
own use. as their remonstrances became more and more threatening,
congress [[thought]] fit to deprive the union of a portion of the privileges
which it had hitherto enjoyed; and at the end of 1832 it passed a law
by which the [[greatest]] part of the [[revenue]] derived from the sale of
lands was made over to the new western republics [[republic]], although the lands
themselves were not ceded to them. *y

[footnote x: the first act of session was made by the [[state]] of new york
in 1780; virginia, massachusetts, connecticut, south and north carolina,
followed this [[example]] at different times [[time]], and lastly, the act of cession
of georgia was made as recently as 1802.]

[footnote y: it is true that the president refused his assent to this
law; but he completely adopted it in [[principle]]. (see message of december
8, 1833.)]

the slightest observation in the [[united]] states enables one to appreciate
the advantages which the [[country]] derives from the bank. these advantages
are of several kinds [[kind]], but one of them is peculiarly striking to the
stranger. the banknotes of the [[united]] states are taken upon the borders
of the desert for the same value as at philadelphia, where the bank
conducts its operations. *z

[footnote z: the [[present]] bank of the [[united]] states was established in
1816, with a [[capital]] of $35,000,000; its charter expires in 1836. last
year congress passed a [[law]] to renew it, but the president put his veto
upon the bill. the struggle is still going on with [[great]] [[violence]] on
either side, and the speedy fall of the bank may easily be foreseen. [it
was soon afterwards extinguished by general jackson.]]

the bank of the [[united]] states is nevertheless the object of great
animosity. its directors have proclaimed their hostility to the
president: and they are accused, not without some show of probability,
of having abused their influence to thwart his election. the president
therefore attacks the establishment which they represent with all the
warmth of personal enmity; and he is encouraged in the pursuit of
his [[revenge]] by the conviction that he is supported by the secret
propensities of the majority. the bank may be regarded as the great
monetary tie of the union, just as congress is the [[great]] legislative
tie; and the same [[passions]] which tend to render the states independent
of the central [[power]], contribute to the overthrow of the bank.

the bank of the [[united]] states always holds a [[great]] number of the notes
issued by the provincial banks, which it can at any [[time]] oblige them to
convert into cash. it has itself nothing to [[fear]] from a similar demand,
as the extent of its resources enables it to meet all claims. but
the existence of the provincial banks is thus threatened, and their
operations are restricted, since they are only able to issue a quantity
of notes duly proportioned to their [[capital]]. they submit with impatience
to this salutary control. the newspapers which they have bought over,
and the president, whose interest renders him their instrument, attack
the bank with the [[greatest]] vehemence. they rouse the local [[passions]] and
the blind democratic instinct of the [[country]] to aid their cause; and
they assert that the bank directors form a permanent aristocratic [[body]],
whose influence must ultimately be [[felt]] in the [[government]], and must
affect those principles [[principle]] of equality upon which [[society]] rests in [[america]].

the contest between the bank and its opponents is only an incident in
the [[great]] struggle which is going on in [[america]] between the provinces
and the central [[power]]; between the spirit of democratic independence
and the spirit of gradation and subordination. i do not mean that the
enemies of the bank are identically the same individuals [[individual]] who, on other
points, attack the federal [[government]]; but i assert that the attacks
directed against the bank of the [[united]] states originate in the same
propensities which militate against the federal [[government]]; and that the
very numerous opponents of the former afford a deplorable symptom of the
decreasing support of the latter.

the union has never displayed so much weakness as in the celebrated
question of the tariff. *a the wars [[war]] of the french [[revolution]] and of 1812
had created manufacturing establishments in the north of the union,
by cutting off all [[free]] communication between [[america]] and [[europe]]. when
peace was concluded, and the channel of intercourse reopened by which
the [[produce]] of [[europe]] was transmitted to the new [[world]], the americans
thought fit to establish a [[system]] of import duties [[duty]], for the twofold
purpose of protecting their incipient manufactures and of paying off the
amount of the debt contracted during the [[war]]. the southern states,
which have no manufactures to encourage, and which are exclusively
agricultural, soon complained of this measure. such were the simple
facts, and i do not pretend to examine in this place whether their
complaints were well founded or [[unjust]].

[footnote a: see principally for the details of this affair, the
legislative documents, 22d congress, 2d session, no. 30.]

as early as the year 1820, south carolina declared, in a petition
to congress, that the tariff was "unconstitutional, oppressive, and
unjust." and the states of georgia, virginia, north carolina, alabama,
and mississippi subsequently remonstrated against it with more or less
vigor. but congress, far from lending an ear to these complaints, raised
the scale of tariff duties [[duty]] in the years 1824 and 1828, and recognized
anew the [[principle]] on which it was founded. a doctrine was then
proclaimed, or rather revived, in the south, which took the name of
nullification.


i have shown in the proper place that the object of the federal
constitution was not to form a league, but to create a national
government. the americans of the [[united]] states form a sole and undivided
people, in all the cases which are specified by that [[constitution]]; and
upon these points the will of the nation is expressed, as it is in all
constitutional nations, by the voice of the majority. when the majority
has pronounced its decision, it is the [[duty]] of the minority to submit.
such is the sound legal doctrine, and the only one which agrees with the
text of the [[constitution]], and the known intention of those who framed
it.

the partisans of nullification in the south maintain, on the contrary,
that the intention of the americans in uniting was not to reduce
themselves to the condition of one and the same [[people]]; that they meant
to constitute a league of independent states; and that each [[state]],
consequently retains its entire sovereignty, if not de facto, at least
de jure; and has the [[right]] of putting its own construction upon the laws
of congress, and of suspending their execution within the limits of its
own territory, if they are held to be unconstitutional and [[unjust]].

the entire doctrine of nullification is comprised in a sentence uttered
by vice-president calhoun, the head of that party in the south,
before the senate of the [[united]] states, in the year 1833: could: "the
constitution is a compact to which the states were parties in their
sovereign capacity; now, whenever a compact is entered into by parties
which acknowledge no tribunal above their [[authority]] to decide in the
last resort, each of them has a [[right]] to [[judge]] for itself in relation
to the [[nature]], extent, and obligations of the instrument." it is
evident that a similar doctrine destroys the very basis of the federal
constitution, and brings back all the evils [[evil]] of the old confederation,
from which the americans were supposed to have had a safe deliverance.

when south carolina perceived that congress turned a deaf ear to its
remonstrances, it threatened to apply the doctrine of nullification to
the federal tariff bill. congress persisted in its former [[system]]; and at
length the storm broke out. in the course of 1832 the [[citizens]] of
south carolina, *b named a national convention, to consult upon the
extraordinary measures which they were called upon to take; and on
november 24th of the same year this convention promulgated a [[law]], under
the form of a decree, which annulled the federal [[law]] of the tariff,
forbade the levy of the imposts which that [[law]] commands, and refused to
recognize the appeal which might be made to the federal courts of [[law]].
*c this decree was only to be put in execution in the ensuing month of
february, and it was intimated, that if congress modified the tariff
before that period, south carolina might be induced to proceed no
further with her menaces; and a vague [[desire]] was afterwards expressed
of submitting the [[question]] to an extraordinary assembly of all the
confederate states.

[footnote b: that is to say, the majority of the [[people]]; for the
opposite party, called the union party, always formed a very [[strong]] and
active minority. carolina may contain about 47,000 electors; 30,000 were
in favor of nullification, and 17,000 opposed to it.]

[footnote c: this decree was preceded by a report of the committee
by which it was framed, containing the explanation of the motives and
object of the [[law]]. the following passage occurs in it, p. 34:--"when
the rights [[right]] reserved by the [[constitution]] to the different states are
deliberately violated, it is the [[duty]] and the [[right]] of those states
to interfere, in order to check the [[progress]] of the [[evil]]; to resist
usurpation, and to maintain, within their respective limits, those
powers and privileges [[privilege]] which belong to them as independent sovereign
states. if they were destitute of this [[right]], they would not be
sovereign. south carolina declares that she acknowledges no tribunal
upon [[earth]] above her [[authority]]. she has indeed entered into a solemn
compact of union with the other states; but she demands, and will
exercise, the [[right]] of putting her own construction upon it; and when
this compact is violated by her sister states, and by the government
which they have created, she is determined to avail herself of the
unquestionable [[right]] of judging what is the extent of the infraction,
and what are the measures [[best]] fitted to obtain [[justice]]."]




chapter xviii: future condition of three races--part ix

in the meantime south carolina armed her militia, and prepared for [[war]].
but congress, which had slighted its suppliant subjects [[subject]], listened to
their complaints as soon as they were found to have taken up arms. *d
a [[law]] was passed, by which the tariff duties [[duty]] were to be progressively
reduced for ten years, until they were brought so low as not to exceed
the amount of supplies necessary to the [[government]]. *e thus congress
completely abandoned the [[principle]] of the tariff; and substituted a mere
fiscal impost to a [[system]] of protective duties [[duty]]. *f the [[government]] of
the union, in order to conceal its defeat, had recourse to an expedient
which is very much in vogue with feeble governments [[government]]. it yielded the
point de facto, but it remained inflexible upon the principles [[principle]] in
question; and whilst congress was altering the tariff [[law]], it passed
another bill, by which the president was invested with extraordinary
powers, enabling him to overcome by [[force]] a [[resistance]] which was then no
longer to be apprehended.

[footnote d: congress was finally decided to take this step by the
conduct of the powerful [[state]] of virginia, whose legislature offered
to serve as mediator between the union and south carolina. hitherto the
latter [[state]] had appeared to be entirely abandoned, even by the states
which had joined in her remonstrances.]

[footnote e: this [[law]] was passed on march 2, 1833.]

[footnote f: this bill was brought in by mr. clay, and it passed in four
days through both houses of congress by an immense majority.]

but south carolina did not [[consent]] to leave the union in the enjoyment
of these scanty trophies of [[success]]: the same national convention which
had annulled the tariff bill, met again, and accepted the proffered
concession; but at the same [[time]] it declared it unabated perseverance
in the doctrine of nullification: and to prove what it said, it annulled
the [[law]] investing the president with extraordinary powers [[power]], although it
was very [[certain]] that the clauses of that [[law]] would never be carried
into effect.

almost all the controversies of which i have been speaking have taken
place under the presidency of general jackson; and it cannot be denied
that in the [[question]] of the tariff he has supported the claims of the
union with vigor and with [[skill]]. i am, however, of [[opinion]] that the
conduct of the [[individual]] who now represents the federal [[government]] may
be reckoned as one of the dangers which threaten its continuance.

some persons [[person]] in [[europe]] have formed an [[opinion]] of the possible influence
of general jackson upon the affairs of his [[country]], which appears highly
extravagant to those who have seen more of the [[subject]]. we have
been told that general jackson has won sundry battles [[battle]], that he is
an energetic [[man]], prone by [[nature]] and by habit to the use of [[force]],
covetous of [[power]], and a despot by taste. all this may perhaps be
true; but the inferences which have been drawn from these truths [[truth]] are
exceedingly erroneous. it has been imagined that general jackson is bent
on establishing a dictatorship in [[america]], on introducing a military
spirit, and on giving a [[degree]] of influence to the central authority
which cannot but be dangerous to provincial liberties [[liberty]]. but in america
the [[time]] for similar undertakings, and the [[age]] for [[men]] of this [[kind]], is
not yet come: if general jackson had entertained a [[hope]] of exercising
his [[authority]] in this manner, he would infallibly have forfeited his
political station, and compromised his [[life]]; accordingly he has not been
so imprudent as to make any such attempt.

far from wishing to extend the federal [[power]], the president belongs
to the party which is desirous of limiting that [[power]] to the bare and
precise letter of the [[constitution]], and which never puts a construction
upon that act favorable to the [[government]] of the union; far from
standing forth as the champion of centralization, general jackson is
the agent of all the jealousies of the states; and he was placed in the
lofty station he occupies by the [[passions]] of the [[people]] which are most
opposed to the central [[government]]. it is by perpetually flattering
these [[passions]] that he maintains his station and his popularity. general
jackson is the [[slave]] of the majority: he yields to its wishes [[wish]], its
propensities, and its demands; say rather, that he anticipates and
forestalls them.

whenever the governments [[government]] of the states come into collision with that
of the union, the president is generally the first to [[question]] his own
rights: he almost always outstrips the legislature; and when the extent
of the federal [[power]] is controverted, he takes part, as it were, against
himself; he conceals his official interests, and extinguishes his own
natural inclinations. not indeed that he is naturally [[weak]] or hostile
to the union; for when the majority decided against the claims of the
partisans of nullification, he put himself at its head, asserted the
doctrines which the nation held distinctly and energetically, and was
the first to recommend forcible measures; but general jackson appears to
me, if i may use the american expressions, to be a federalist by taste,
and a republican by calculation.

general jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority, but when he
feels that his popularity is secure, he overthrows all obstacles in the
pursuit of the objects which the [[community]] approves, or of those which
it does not look upon with a [[jealous]] eye. he is supported by a power
with which his predecessors were unacquainted; and he tramples on his
personal enemies [[enemy]] whenever they cross his path with a facility which no
former president ever enjoyed; he takes upon himself the responsibility
of measures which no one before him would have ventured to attempt: he
even treats the national representatives with disdain approaching to
insult; he puts his veto upon the laws [[law]] of congress, and frequently
neglects to reply to that powerful [[body]]. he is a favorite who sometimes
treats his master roughly. the [[power]] of general jackson perpetually
increases; but that of the president declines; in his hands the federal
government is [[strong]], but it will pass enfeebled into the hands of his
successor.

i am strangely mistaken if the federal [[government]] of the [[united]] states
be not constantly losing [[strength]], retiring gradually from public
affairs, and narrowing its circle of action more and more. it is
naturally feeble, but it now abandons even its pretensions to [[strength]].
on the other hand, i [[thought]] that i remarked a more lively sense of
independence, and a more decided attachment to provincial [[government]] in
the states. the union is to subsist, but to subsist as a shadow; it
is to be [[strong]] in [[certain]] cases, and [[weak]] in all others; in [[time]] of
warfare, it is to be able to concentrate all the forces [[force]] of the nation
and all the resources of the [[country]] in its hands; and in [[time]] of
peace its existence is to be scarcely perceptible: as if this alternate
debility and vigor were [[natural]] or possible.

i do not foresee anything for the [[present]] which may be able to
check this general impulse of [[public]] [[opinion]]; the causes in which it
originated do not cease to operate with the same effect. the [[change]] will
therefore go on, and it may be predicted that, unless some extraordinary
event occurs, the [[government]] of the union will grow weaker and weaker
every day.

i [[think]], however, that the period is still remote at which the federal
power will be entirely extinguished by its inability to [[protect]] itself
and to maintain [[peace]] in the [[country]]. the union is sanctioned by
the manners and desires [[desire]] of the [[people]]; its results are palpable, its
benefits visible. when it is perceived that the weakness of the federal
government compromises the existence of the union, i do not [[doubt]] that a
reaction will take place with a view to increase its [[strength]].

the [[government]] of the [[united]] states is, of all the federal governments
which have hitherto been established, the one which is most naturally
destined to act. as long as it is only indirectly assailed by the
interpretation of its laws [[law]], and as long as its substance is not
seriously altered, a [[change]] of [[opinion]], an internal crisis, or a [[war]],
may restore all the vigor which it requires. the point which i have
been most anxious to put in a clear [[light]] is simply this: many [[people]],
especially in [[france]], imagine that a [[change]] in [[opinion]] is going on in
the [[united]] states, which is favorable to a centralization of [[power]] in
the hands of the president and the congress. i hold that a contrary
tendency may distinctly be observed. so far is the federal government
from acquiring [[strength]], and from threatening the sovereignty of the
states, as it grows older, that i maintain it to be growing weaker and
weaker, and that the sovereignty of the union alone is in danger. such
are the facts [[fact]] which the [[present]] [[time]] discloses. the future conceals the
final result of this tendency, and the events which may check, retard,
or accelerate the changes [[change]] i have described; but i do not affect to be
able to remove the veil which hides them from our sight.

of the republican [[institutions]] of the [[united]] states, and what their
chances of duration are

the union is accidental--the republican [[institutions]] have more prospect
of permanence--a [[republic]] for the [[present]] the [[natural]] [[state]] of the
anglo-americans--reason of this--in order to [[destroy]] it, all the laws
must be changed at the same [[time]], and a [[great]] alteration take place
in manners--difficulties experienced by the americans in creating an
aristocracy.

the dismemberment of the union, by the introduction of [[war]] into the
heart of those states which are now confederate, with standing armies [[army]],
a dictatorship, and a heavy [[taxation]], might, eventually, compromise the
fate of the republican [[institutions]]. but we ought not to confound the
future prospects of the [[republic]] with those of the union. the union is
an accident, which will only [[last]] as long as circumstances are favorable
to its existence; but a republican form of [[government]] seems to me to
be the [[natural]] [[state]] of the americans; which nothing but the continued
action of hostile causes, always acting in the same direction, could
change into a [[monarchy]]. the union exists principally in the [[law]] which
formed it; one [[revolution]], one [[change]] in [[public]] [[opinion]], might destroy
it forever; but the [[republic]] has a much deeper foundation to rest upon.


what is understood by a republican [[government]] in the [[united]] states is
the slow and quiet action of [[society]] upon itself. it is a regular state
of things really founded upon the enlightened will of the [[people]]. it is
a conciliatory [[government]] under which resolutions are allowed [[time]] to
ripen; and in which they are deliberately discussed, and executed with
mature [[judgment]]. the republicans in the [[united]] states set a high value
upon morality, [[respect]] [[religious]] [[belief]], and acknowledge the
existence of rights [[right]]. they profess to [[think]] that a [[people]] ought to be
moral, [[religious]], and temperate, in proportion as it is [[free]]. what is
called the [[republic]] in the [[united]] states, is the tranquil [[rule]] of the
majority, which, after having had [[time]] to examine itself, and to give
proof of its existence, is the [[common]] source of all the powers [[power]] of the
state. but the [[power]] of the majority is not of itself unlimited. in the
moral [[world]] [[humanity]], [[justice]], and [[reason]] enjoy an undisputed [[supremacy]];
in the [[political]] [[world]] vested rights [[right]] are treated with no less deference.
the majority recognizes these two barriers; and if it now and then
overstep them, it is because, like individuals [[individual]], it has [[passions]], and,
like them, it is prone to do what is [[wrong]], whilst it discerns what is
right.

but the demagogues of [[europe]] have made [[strange]] discoveries. a republic
is not, according to them, the [[rule]] of the majority, as has hitherto
been [[thought]], but the [[rule]] of those who are strenuous partisans of
the majority. it is not the [[people]] who preponderates in this [[kind]] of
government, but those who are [[best]] versed in the [[good]] qualities of the
people. a [[happy]] distinction, which allows [[men]] to act in the name of
nations without consulting them, and to claim their gratitude whilst
their rights [[right]] are spurned. a republican [[government]], moreover, is the only
one which claims the [[right]] of doing whatever it chooses, and despising
what [[men]] have hitherto respected, from the highest [[moral]] obligations to
the vulgar rules [[rule]] of common-sense. it had been supposed, until our [[time]],
that despotism was odious, under whatever form it appeared. but it is
a discovery of [[modern]] days that there are such things as legitimate
tyranny and holy [[injustice]], provided they are exercised in the name of
the [[people]].

the ideas [[idea]] which the americans have adopted respecting the republican
form of [[government]], render it easy for them to [[live]] under it, and insure
its duration. if, in their [[country]], this form be often practically [[bad]],
at least it is theoretically [[good]]; and, in the end, the [[people]] always
acts in conformity to it.

it was impossible at the foundation of the states, and it would still
be difficult, to establish a central administration in [[america]]. the
inhabitants are dispersed over too [[great]] a space, and separated by too
many [[natural]] obstacles, for one [[man]] to undertake to direct the details
of their existence. [[america]] is therefore pre-eminently the [[country]] of
provincial and municipal [[government]]. to this cause, which was plainly
felt by all the europeans [[european]] of the new [[world]], the anglo-americans added
several others peculiar to themselves.

at the [[time]] of the settlement of the north american colonies, municipal
liberty had already penetrated into the laws [[law]] as well as the manners
of the english; and the emigrants adopted it, not only as a necessary
thing, but as a benefit which they knew how to appreciate. we have
already seen the manner in which the colonies were founded: every
province, and almost every district, was peopled separately by [[men]] who
were strangers to each other, or who associated with very different
purposes. the english settlers in the [[united]] states, therefore, early
perceived that they were divided into a [[great]] number of small and
distinct communities [[community]] which belonged to no [[common]] centre; and that it
was needful for each of these little communities [[community]] to take [[care]] of its own
affairs, since there did not appear to be any central [[authority]] which
was naturally bound and easily enabled to provide for them. thus, the
nature of the [[country]], the manner in which the british colonies were
founded, the habits of the first emigrants, in short everything,
united to promote, in an extraordinary [[degree]], municipal and provincial
liberties.

in the [[united]] states, therefore, the mass of the [[institutions]] of the
country is essentially republican; and in order permanently to destroy
the laws [[law]] which form the basis of the [[republic]], it would be necessary to
abolish all the laws [[law]] at once. at the [[present]] day it would be even more
difficult for a party to succeed in founding a [[monarchy]] in the united
states than for a set of [[men]] to proclaim that [[france]] should henceforward
be a [[republic]]. royalty would not find a [[system]] of legislation prepared
for it beforehand; and a [[monarchy]] would then [[exist]], really surrounded by
republican [[institutions]]. the monarchical [[principle]] would likewise have
great difficulty in penetrating into the manners of the americans.

in the [[united]] states, the sovereignty of the [[people]] is not an isolated
doctrine bearing no relation to the prevailing manners and ideas [[idea]] of the
people: it may, on the contrary, be regarded as the [[last]] link of a chain
of opinions [[opinion]] which binds the whole anglo-american [[world]]. that providence
has given to every [[human]] being the [[degree]] of [[reason]] necessary to direct
himself in the affairs which interest him exclusively--such is the grand
maxim upon which civil and [[political]] [[society]] rests in the [[united]] states.
the [[father]] of a [[family]] applies it to his [[children]]; the master to his
servants; the township to its officers; the province to its townships;
the [[state]] to its provinces; the union to the states; and when extended
to the nation, it becomes the doctrine of the sovereignty of the [[people]].

thus, in the [[united]] states, the fundamental [[principle]] of the republic
is the same which governs the greater part of [[human]] actions; republican
notions insinuate themselves into all the ideas [[idea]], opinions [[opinion]], and habits of
the americans, whilst they are formerly recognized by the legislation:
and before this legislation can be altered the whole [[community]] must
undergo very serious changes [[change]]. in the [[united]] states, even the [[religion]] of
most of the [[citizens]] is republican, since it submits the truths [[truth]] of the
other [[world]] to private [[judgment]]: as in [[politics]] the [[care]] of its temporal
interests is abandoned to the [[good]] sense of the [[people]]. thus every man
is allowed freely to take that road which he thinks [[think]] will lead him to
heaven; just as the [[law]] permits every citizen to have the [[right]] of
choosing his [[government]].

it is evident that nothing but a long series of events, all having the
same tendency, can substitute for this combination of laws [[law]], opinions [[opinion]],
and manners, a mass of opposite opinions [[opinion]], manners, and laws [[law]].

if republican principles [[principle]] are to perish in [[america]], they can only yield
after a laborious social process, often interrupted, and as often
resumed; they will have many apparent revivals, and will not become
totally extinct until an entirely new [[people]] shall have succeeded to
that which now exists. now, it must be admitted that there is no symptom
or presage of the approach of such a [[revolution]]. there is nothing more
striking to a [[person]] newly arrived in the [[united]] states, than the kind
of tumultuous agitation in which he finds [[political]] [[society]]. the laws
are incessantly changing, and at first sight it seems impossible that a
people so variable in its desires [[desire]] should avoid adopting, within a short
space of [[time]], a completely new form of [[government]]. such apprehensions
are, however, premature; the instability which affects political
institutions is of two kinds [[kind]], which ought not to be confounded: the
first, which modifies secondary laws [[law]], is not incompatible with a very
settled [[state]] of [[society]]; the other shakes the very foundations of the
constitution, and attacks the fundamental principles [[principle]] of legislation;
this [[species]] of instability is always followed by troubles and
revolutions, and the nation which suffers under it is in a [[state]] of
violent transition.

experience shows that these two kinds [[kind]] of legislative instability have
no necessary connection; for they have been found [[united]] or separate,
according to times [[time]] and circumstances. the first is [[common]] in the united
states, but not the second: the americans often [[change]] their laws [[law]], but
the foundation of the [[constitution]] is respected.

in our days the republican [[principle]] rules [[rule]] in [[america]], as the
monarchical [[principle]] did in [[france]] under louis xiv. the french of
that period were not only [[friends]] of the [[monarchy]], but they [[thought]] it
impossible to put anything in its place; they received it as we receive
the rays of the sun and the return of the seasons. amongst them the
royal [[power]] had neither advocates nor opponents. in like manner does
the republican [[government]] [[exist]] in [[america]], without contention or
opposition; without proofs and arguments, by a tacit agreement, a sort
of consensus universalis. it is, however, my [[opinion]] that by changing
their administrative forms as often as they do, the inhabitants of the
united states compromise the future stability of their [[government]].

it may be apprehended that [[men]], perpetually thwarted in their designs
by the mutability of the legislation, will learn to look upon republican
institutions as an inconvenient form of [[society]]; the [[evil]] resulting from
the instability of the secondary enactments might then raise a doubt
as to the [[nature]] of the fundamental principles [[principle]] of the [[constitution]],
and indirectly bring about a [[revolution]]; but this epoch is still very
remote.

it may, however, be foreseen even now, that when the americans lose
their republican [[institutions]] they will speedily arrive at a despotic
government, without a long interval of limited [[monarchy]]. montesquieu
remarked, that nothing is more absolute than the [[authority]] of a
prince who immediately succeeds a [[republic]], since the powers [[power]] which had
fearlessly been intrusted to an elected magistrate are then transferred
to a hereditary [[sovereign]]. this is true in general, but it is more
peculiarly applicable to a democratic [[republic]]. in the [[united]] states,
the magistrates are not elected by a particular class of [[citizens]], but
by the majority of the nation; they are the immediate representatives of
the [[passions]] of the multitude; and as they are wholly dependent upon its
pleasure, they excite neither [[hatred]] nor [[fear]]: hence, as i have already
shown, very little [[care]] has been taken to limit their influence, and
they are left in possession of a vast deal of arbitrary [[power]]. this
state of things has engendered habits which would outlive itself; the
american magistrate would retain his [[power]], but he would cease to be
responsible for the exercise of it; and it is impossible to say what
bounds could then be set to [[tyranny]].

some of our [[european]] politicians expect to see an [[aristocracy]] arise in
america, and they already predict the exact period at which it will be
able to assume the reins of [[government]]. i have previously observed, and
i repeat my assertion, that the [[present]] tendency of american society
appears to me to become more and more democratic. nevertheless, i do not
assert that the americans will not, at some future [[time]], restrict the
circle of [[political]] rights [[right]] in their [[country]], or confiscate those rights
to the advantage of a [[single]] [[individual]]; but i cannot imagine that they
will ever bestow the exclusive exercise of them upon a privileged
class of [[citizens]], or, in other words, that they will ever found an
aristocracy.

an aristocratic [[body]] is composed of a [[certain]] number of citizens
who, without being very far removed from the mass of the [[people]], are,
nevertheless, permanently stationed above it: a [[body]] which it is easy
to touch and difficult to strike; with which the [[people]] are in daily
contact, but with which they can never combine. nothing can be imagined
more contrary to [[nature]] and to the secret propensities of the human
heart than a subjection of this [[kind]]; and [[men]] who are left to follow
their own bent will always prefer the arbitrary [[power]] of a [[king]] to the
regular administration of an [[aristocracy]]. aristocratic institutions
cannot subsist without laying down the inequality of [[men]] as a
fundamental [[principle]], as a part and parcel of the legislation,
affecting the condition of the [[human]] [[family]] as much as it affects that
of [[society]]; but these are things so repugnant to [[natural]] equity that
they can only be extorted from [[men]] by constraint.

i do not [[think]] a [[single]] [[people]] can be quoted, since [[human]] [[society]] began
to [[exist]], which has, by its own [[free]] will and by its own exertions,
created an [[aristocracy]] within its own bosom. all the aristocracies of
the middle ages [[age]] were founded by [[military]] [[conquest]]; the conqueror was the
noble, the vanquished became the serf. inequality was then imposed by
force; and after it had been introduced into the manners of the country
it maintained its own [[authority]], and was sanctioned by the legislation.
communities have existed which were aristocratic from their earliest
origin, owing to circumstances anterior to that event, and which became
more democratic in each succeeding [[age]]. such was the [[destiny]] of the
romans, and of the barbarians after them. but a [[people]], having taken its
rise in [[civilization]] and [[democracy]], which should gradually establish an
inequality of conditions, until it arrived at inviolable privileges [[privilege]] and
exclusive castes, would be a novelty in the [[world]]; and nothing intimates
that [[america]] is likely to furnish so singular an [[example]].

reflection on the causes of the commercial [[prosperity]] of the of the
united states

the americans destined by [[nature]] to be a [[great]] maritime people--extent
of their coasts--depth of their ports--size of their rivers--the
commercial superiority of the anglo-americans less attributable,
however, to physical circumstances than to [[moral]] and intellectual
causes--reason of this opinion--future [[destiny]] of the anglo-americans
as a commercial nation--the dissolution of the union would not check
the maritime vigor of the states--reason of this--anglo-americans will
naturally supply the wants of the inhabitants of south america--they
will become, like the english, the factors of a [[great]] portion of the
world.

the coast of the [[united]] states, from the bay of fundy to the sabine
river in the gulf of mexico, is more than two thousand miles in extent.
these shores form an unbroken line, and they are all [[subject]] to the same
government. no nation in the [[world]] possesses vaster, deeper, or more
secure ports for shipping than the americans.

the inhabitants of the [[united]] states constitute a [[great]] civilized
people, which [[fortune]] has placed in the midst of an uncultivated
country at a distance of three thousand miles from the central point
of [[civilization]]. [[america]] consequently stands in daily need of european
trade. the americans will, no [[doubt]], ultimately succeed in producing or
manufacturing at [[home]] most of the articles which they require; but the
two continents can never be independent of each other, so numerous are
the [[natural]] ties which [[exist]] between their wants, their ideas [[idea]], their
habits, and their manners.

the union produces [[produce]] peculiar commodities which are now become necessary
to us, but which cannot be cultivated, or can only be raised at an
enormous expense, upon the soil of [[europe]]. the americans only consume a
small portion of this [[produce]], and they are willing to sell us the rest.
europe is therefore the market of [[america]], as [[america]] is the market
of [[europe]]; and maritime commerce is no less necessary to enable the
inhabitants of the [[united]] states to transport their raw materials to
the ports of [[europe]], than it is to enable us to supply them with our
manufactured [[produce]]. the [[united]] states were therefore necessarily
reduced to the alternative of increasing the [[business]] of other maritime
nations to a [[great]] extent, if they had themselves declined to enter
into commerce, as the spaniards of mexico have hitherto done; or, in the
second place, of becoming one of the first trading powers [[power]] of the globe.

the anglo-americans have always displayed a very decided taste for the
sea. the declaration of independence broke the commercial restrictions
which [[united]] them to [[england]], and gave a fresh and powerful stimulus to
their maritime genius. ever since that [[time]], the shipping of the union
has increased in almost the same rapid proportion as the number of its
inhabitants. the americans themselves now transport to their own shores
nine-tenths of the [[european]] [[produce]] which they consume. *g and they also
bring three-quarters of the exports of the new [[world]] to the european
consumer. *h the ships of the [[united]] states fill the docks of havre and
of liverpool; whilst the number of english and french vessels which are
to be seen at new york is comparatively small. *i

[footnote g: the total value of goods [[good]] imported during the year which
ended on september 30, 1832, was $101,129,266. the value of the cargoes
of [[foreign]] vessels did not amount to $10,731,039, or about one-tenth of
the entire sum.]

[footnote h: the value of goods [[good]] exported during the same year amounted
to $87,176,943; the value of goods [[good]] exported by [[foreign]] vessels amounted
to $21,036,183, or about one quarter of the whole sum. (williams's
"register," 1833, p. 398.)]

[footnote i: the tonnage of the vessels which entered all the ports of
the union in the years 1829, 1830, and 1831, amounted to 3,307,719 tons,
of which 544,571 tons were [[foreign]] vessels; they stood, therefore,
to the american vessels in a ratio of about 16 to 100. ("national
calendar," 1833, p. 304.) the tonnage of the english vessels which
entered the ports of [[london]], liverpool, and hull, in the years 1820,
1826, and 1831, amounted to 443,800 tons. the [[foreign]] vessels which
entered the same ports during the same years amounted to 159,431 tons.
the ratio between them was, therefore, about 36 to 100. ("companion
to the almanac," 1834, p. 169.) in the year 1832 the ratio between the
foreign and british ships which entered the ports of [[great]] [[britain]] was
29 to 100. [these statements relate to a condition of affairs which
has ceased to [[exist]]; the civil [[war]] and the heavy [[taxation]] of the united
states entirely altered the [[trade]] and navigation of the [[country]].]]

thus, not only does the american merchant face the competition of his
own countrymen, but he even supports that of [[foreign]] nations in their
own ports with [[success]]. this is readily explained by the [[fact]] that the
vessels of the [[united]] states can cross the seas at a cheaper rate than
any other vessels in the [[world]]. as long as the mercantile shipping of
the [[united]] states preserves this superiority, it will not only retain
what it has acquired, but it will constantly increase in [[prosperity]].




chapter xviii: future condition of three races--part x

it is difficult to say for what [[reason]] the americans can [[trade]] at a
lower rate than other nations; and one is at first [[led]] to attribute
this circumstance to the physical or [[natural]] advantages which are within
their reach; but this supposition is erroneous. the american vessels
cost almost as much to build as our own; *j they are not [[better]] built,
and they generally [[last]] for a shorter [[time]]. the [[pay]] of the american
sailor is more considerable than the [[pay]] on board [[european]] ships; which
is proved by the [[great]] number of europeans [[european]] who are to be met with in the
merchant vessels of the [[united]] states. but i am of [[opinion]] that the
true cause of their superiority must not be sought for in physical
advantages, but that it is wholly attributable to their [[moral]] and
intellectual qualities.

[footnote j: materials are, generally speaking, less expensive in
america than in [[europe]], but the price of labor is much higher.]

the following comparison will illustrate my meaning. during the
campaigns of the [[revolution]] the french introduced a new [[system]] of
tactics into the art [[arts]] of [[war]], which perplexed the oldest generals,
and very nearly destroyed the most ancient monarchies [[monarchy]] in [[europe]]. they
undertook (what had never before been attempted) to make shift without
a number of things which had always been held to be indispensable in
warfare; they required novel exertions on the part of their [[troops]] which
no civilized nations had ever [[thought]] of; they achieved [[great]] actions
in an incredibly short space of [[time]]; and they risked [[human]] [[life]] without
hesitation to obtain the object in view. the french had less [[money]] and
fewer [[men]] than their enemies [[enemy]]; their resources were infinitely inferior;
nevertheless they were constantly victorious, until their adversaries
chose to imitate their [[example]].

the americans have introduced a similar [[system]] into their commercial
speculations; and they do for cheapness what the french did for
conquest. the [[european]] sailor navigates with prudence; he only sets sail
when the weather is favorable; if an unforseen accident befalls him, he
puts into port; at night he furls a portion of his canvas; and when the
whitening billows intimate the vicinity of [[land]], he checks his way,
and takes an observation of the sun. but the american neglects these
precautions and braves these dangers. he weighs anchor in the midst
of tempestuous gales; by night and by day he spreads his sheets to the
wind; he repairs as he goes along such damage as his vessel may have
sustained from the storm; and when he at [[last]] approaches the term of his
voyage, he darts onward to the shore as if he already descried a port.
the americans are often shipwrecked, but no trader crosses the seas so
rapidly. and as they perform the same distance in a shorter [[time]], they
can perform it at a cheaper rate.

the [[european]] touches several times [[time]] at different ports in the course of a
long [[voyage]]; he loses a [[good]] deal of precious [[time]] in making the harbor,
or in waiting for a favorable wind to leave it; and he pays [[pay]] daily dues
to be allowed to remain there. the american starts from boston to go to
purchase tea in [[china]]; he arrives at canton, stays there a few days, and
then returns. in less than two years he has sailed as far as the entire
circumference of the globe, and he has seen [[land]] but once. it is true
that during a [[voyage]] of eight or ten months he has drunk brackish water
and lived upon salt meat; that he has been in a continual contest with
the sea, with disease, and with a tedious existence; but upon his return
he can sell a pound of his tea for a half-penny less than the english
merchant, and his [[purpose]] is accomplished.

i cannot [[better]] explain my meaning than by saying that the americans
affect a sort of heroism in their manner of trading. but the european
merchant will always find it very difficult to imitate his american
competitor, who, in adopting the [[system]] which i have just described,
follows not only a calculation of his gain, but an impulse of his
nature.

the inhabitants of the [[united]] states are [[subject]] to all the wants and
all the desires [[desire]] which result from an advanced stage of [[civilization]]; but
as they are not surrounded by a [[community]] admirably adapted, like that
of [[europe]], to satisfy their wants, they are often obliged to procure for
themselves the various articles which [[education]] and habit have rendered
necessaries. in [[america]] it sometimes happens that the same individual
tills his field, builds his dwelling, contrives his tools, makes his
shoes, and weaves the coarse stuff of which his dress is composed.
this circumstance is prejudicial to the excellence of the [[work]]; but
it powerfully contributes to awaken the [[intelligence]] of the workman.
nothing tends to materialize [[man]], and to deprive his [[work]] of the
faintest trace of [[mind]], more than extreme division of labor. in a
country like [[america]], where [[men]] devoted to special occupations are rare,
a long apprenticeship cannot be required from anyone who embraces a
profession. the americans, therefore, [[change]] their means of gaining
a livelihood very readily; and they suit their occupations to the
exigencies of the moment, in the manner most profitable to themselves.
men are to be met with who have successively been barristers, farmers [[farmer]],
merchants, ministers of the gospel, and physicians. if the american be
less [[perfect]] in each craft than the [[european]], at least there is scarcely
any [[trade]] with which he is utterly unacquainted. his capacity is more
general, and the circle of his [[intelligence]] is enlarged.

the inhabitants of the [[united]] states are never fettered by the axioms of
their profession; they escape from all the prejudices of their present
station; they are not more attached to one line of operation than to
another; they are not more prone to employ an old method than a new
one; they have no rooted habits, and they easily shake off the influence
which the habits of other nations might exercise upon their minds [[mind]] from
a conviction that their [[country]] is unlike any other, and that its
situation is without a precedent in the [[world]]. [[america]] is a [[land]] of
wonders, in which everything is in constant motion, and every movement
seems an improvement. the [[idea]] of novelty is there indissolubly
connected with the [[idea]] of amelioration. no [[natural]] boundary seems to be
set to the efforts of [[man]]; and what is not yet done is only what he has
not yet attempted to do.

this perpetual [[change]] which goes on in the [[united]] states, these frequent
vicissitudes of [[fortune]], accompanied by such unforeseen fluctuations in
private and in [[public]] [[wealth]], serve to keep the minds [[mind]] of the citizens
in a perpetual [[state]] of feverish agitation, which admirably invigorates
their exertions, and keeps them in a [[state]] of excitement above the
ordinary level of [[mankind]]. the whole [[life]] of an american is passed
like a game of [[chance]], a revolutionary crisis, or a [[battle]]. as the
same causes are continually in operation throughout the [[country]], they
ultimately impart an irresistible impulse to the national [[character]]. the
american, taken as a [[chance]] specimen of his countrymen, must then be a
man of singular warmth in his desires [[desire]], enterprising, fond of adventure,
and, above all, of innovation. the same bent is manifest in all that he
does; he introduces it into his [[political]] laws [[law]], his [[religious]] doctrines,
his theories of social economy, and his domestic occupations; he bears
it with him in the depths of the backwoods, as well as in the business
of the [[city]]. it is this same passion, applied to maritime commerce,
which makes him the cheapest and the quickest trader in the [[world]].

as long as the sailors of the [[united]] states retain these inspiriting
advantages, and the practical superiority which they derive from them,
they will not only continue to supply the wants of the producers and
consumers of their own [[country]], but they will tend more and more to
become, like the english, the factors of all other peoples [[people]]. *k this
prediction has already begun to be realized; we perceive that the
american traders are introducing themselves as intermediate agents in
the commerce of several [[european]] nations; *l and [[america]] will offer a
still wider field to their enterprise.

[footnote k: it must not be supposed that english vessels are
exclusively employed in transporting [[foreign]] [[produce]] into [[england]], or
british [[produce]] to [[foreign]] countries [[country]]; at the [[present]] day the merchant
shipping of [[england]] may be regarded in the [[light]] of a vast [[system]] of
public conveyances, ready to serve all the producers of the [[world]], and
to open communications between all peoples [[people]]. the maritime genius of the
americans prompts them to enter into competition with the english.]

[footnote l: part of the commerce of the mediterranean is already
carried on by american vessels.]

the [[great]] colonies which were founded in south [[america]] by the spaniards
and the portuguese have since become empires. civil [[war]] and oppression
now lay waste those extensive regions. [[population]] does not increase, and
the thinly scattered inhabitants are too much absorbed in the cares [[care]] of
self-defense even to attempt any amelioration of their condition. such,
however, will not always be the case. [[europe]] has succeeded by her own
efforts in piercing the gloom of the middle ages [[age]]; south [[america]] has the
same [[christian]] laws [[law]] and [[christian]] manners as we have; she contains all
the germs of [[civilization]] which have grown amidst the nations of
europe or their offsets, added to the advantages to be derived from our
example: why then should she always remain uncivilized? it is clear that
the [[question]] is simply one of [[time]]; at some future period, which may be
more or less remote, the inhabitants of south [[america]] will constitute
flourishing and enlightened nations.

but when the spaniards and portuguese of south [[america]] begin to feel
the wants [[common]] to all civilized nations, they will still be unable
to satisfy those wants for themselves; as the youngest [[children]] of
civilization, they must perforce admit the superiority of their elder
brethren. they will be agriculturists long before they succeed in
manufactures or commerce, and they will require the mediation of
strangers to exchange their [[produce]] beyond seas for those articles for
which a demand will begin to be [[felt]].

it is unquestionable that the americans of the north will one day supply
the wants of the americans of the south. [[nature]] has placed them in
contiguity, and has furnished the former with every means of knowing and
appreciating those demands, of establishing a permanent connection with
those states, and of gradually filling their markets. the merchants of
the [[united]] states could only forfeit these [[natural]] advantages if he were
very inferior to the merchant of [[europe]]; to whom he is, on the contrary,
superior in several respects [[respect]]. the americans of the [[united]] states already
exercise a very considerable [[moral]] influence upon all the peoples [[people]] of
the new [[world]]. they are the source of [[intelligence]], and all the nations
which inhabit the same continent are already accustomed to consider them
as the most enlightened, the most powerful, and the most wealthy members
of the [[great]] american [[family]]. all [[eyes]] are therefore turned towards
the union; and the states of which that [[body]] is composed are the models
which the other communities [[community]] try to imitate to the [[best]] of their [[power]];
it is from the [[united]] states that they borrow their [[political]] principles
and their laws [[law]].

the americans of the [[united]] states stand in precisely the same position
with regard to the peoples [[people]] of south [[america]] as their fathers [[father]], the
english, occupy with regard to the italians, the spaniards, the
portuguese, and all those nations of [[europe]] which receive their articles
of daily consumption from [[england]], because they are less advanced in
civilization and [[trade]]. [[england]] is at this [[time]] the [[natural]] emporium of
almost all the nations which are within its reach; the american union
will perform the same part in the other hemisphere; and every community
which is founded, or which prospers in the new [[world]], is founded and
prospers to the advantage of the anglo-americans.

if the union were to be dissolved, the commerce of the states which now
compose it would undoubtedly be checked for a [[time]]; but this consequence
would be less perceptible than is generally supposed. it is evident
that, whatever may happen, the commercial states will remain [[united]].
they are all contiguous to each other; they have identically the same
opinions, interests, and manners; and they are alone competent to form a
very [[great]] maritime [[power]]. even if the south of the union were to become
independent of the north, it would still require the services of those
states. i have already observed that the south is not a commercial
country, and nothing intimates that it is likely to become so. the
americans of the south of the [[united]] states will therefore be obliged,
for a long [[time]] to come, to have recourse to strangers to export their
produce, and to supply them with the commodities which are requisite to
satisfy their wants. but the northern states are undoubtedly able to act
as their intermediate agents cheaper than any other merchants. they will
therefore retain that employment, for cheapness is the [[sovereign]] law
of commerce. national claims and national prejudices cannot resist the
influence of cheapness. nothing can be more virulent than the hatred
which exists between the americans of the [[united]] states and the english.
but notwithstanding these inimical feelings, the americans derive the
greater part of their manufactured commodities from [[england]], because
england supplies them at a cheaper rate than any other nation. thus the
increasing [[prosperity]] of [[america]] turns, notwithstanding the grudges of
the americans, to the advantage of british manufactures.

reason shows and [[experience]] proves that no commercial [[prosperity]] can be
durable if it cannot be [[united]], in case of need, to naval [[force]]. this
truth is as well understood in the [[united]] states as it can be anywhere
else: the americans are already able to make their flag respected; in a
few years they will be able to make it feared. i am convinced that the
dismemberment of the union would not have the effect of diminishing the
naval [[power]] of the americans, but that it would powerfully contribute
to increase it. at the [[present]] [[time]] the commercial states are connected
with others which have not the same interests, and which frequently
yield an unwilling [[consent]] to the increase of a maritime [[power]] by which
they are only indirectly benefited. if, on the contrary, the commercial
states of the union formed one independent nation, commerce would become
the foremost of their national interests; they would consequently be
willing to make very [[great]] sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to [[protect]] their shipping, and
nothing would prevent them from pursuing their designs upon this point.

nations, as well as [[men]], almost always betray the most prominent
features of their future [[destiny]] in their earliest years. when
i contemplate the ardor with which the anglo-americans prosecute
commercial enterprise, the advantages which befriend them, and the
success of their undertakings, i cannot refrain from believing that they
will one day become the first maritime [[power]] of the globe. they are born
to [[rule]] the seas, as the romans were to conquer the [[world]].

conclusion

i have now nearly reached the close of my inquiry; hitherto, in speaking
of the future [[destiny]] of the [[united]] states, i have endeavored to divide
my [[subject]] into distinct portions, in order to study each of them with
more attention. my [[present]] object is to embrace the whole from one
single point; the remarks i shall make will be less detailed, but they
will be more sure. i shall perceive each object less distinctly, but i
shall descry the principal facts [[fact]] with more certainty. a traveller who
has just left the walls of an immense [[city]], climbs the neighboring hill;
as he goes [[father]] off he loses sight of the [[men]] whom he has so recently
quitted; their dwellings are confused in a dense mass; he can no longer
distinguish the [[public]] squares, and he can scarcely trace out the
great thoroughfares; but his eye has less difficulty in following the
boundaries of the [[city]], and for the first [[time]] he sees the shape of
the vast whole. such is the future [[destiny]] of the british [[race]] in north
america to my eye; the details of the stupendous picture are overhung
with shade, but i conceive a clear [[idea]] of the entire [[subject]].

the territory now occupied or possessed by the [[united]] states of america
forms about one-twentieth part of the habitable [[earth]]. but extensive as
these confines are, it must not be supposed that the anglo-american race
will always remain within them; indeed, it has already far overstepped
them.

there was once a [[time]] at which we also might have created a [[great]] french
nation in the american wilds, to counterbalance the influence of the
english upon the destinies of the new [[world]]. [[france]] formerly possessed
a territory in north [[america]], scarcely less extensive than the whole of
europe. the three [[greatest]] rivers of that continent then flowed within
her dominions. the [[indian]] tribes which dwelt between the mouth of the
st. lawrence and the delta of the mississippi were unaccustomed to any
other tongue but ours; and all the [[european]] settlements scattered over
that immense region recalled the traditions of our [[country]]. louisbourg,
montmorency, duquesne, st. louis, vincennes, new orleans (for such were
the names they bore) are words dear to [[france]] and familiar to our ears.

but a concourse of circumstances, which it would be tedious to
enumerate, *m have deprived us of this magnificent [[inheritance]]. wherever
the french settlers were numerically [[weak]] and partially established,
they have disappeared: those who remain are collected on a small extent
of [[country]], and are now [[subject]] to other laws [[law]]. the 400,000 french
inhabitants of lower canada constitute, at the [[present]] [[time]], the remnant
of an old nation lost in the midst of a new [[people]]. a [[foreign]] population
is increasing around them unceasingly and on all sides, which already
penetrates amongst the ancient masters of the [[country]], predominates in
their cities [[city]] and corrupts their [[language]]. this [[population]] is identical
with that of the [[united]] states; it is therefore with [[truth]] that i
asserted that the british [[race]] is not confined within the frontiers of
the union, since it already extends to the northeast.

[footnote m: the foremost of these circumstances is, that nations which
are accustomed to [[free]] [[institutions]] and municipal [[government]] are better
able than any others to found prosperous colonies. the habit of thinking
and governing for oneself is indispensable in a new [[country]], where
success necessarily depends, in a [[great]] measure, upon the individual
exertions of the settlers.]

to the northwest nothing is to be met with but a few insignificant
russian settlements; but to the southwest, mexico presents [[present]] a barrier to
the anglo-americans. thus, the spaniards and the anglo-americans are,
properly speaking, the only two races [[race]] which divide the possession of the
new [[world]]. the limits of separation between them have been settled by
a treaty; but although the conditions of that treaty are exceedingly
favorable to the anglo-americans, i do not [[doubt]] that they will
shortly infringe this arrangement. vast provinces, extending beyond
the frontiers of the union towards mexico, are still destitute of
inhabitants. the natives of the [[united]] states will forestall the
rightful occupants of these solitary regions. they will take possession
of the soil, and establish social [[institutions]], so that when the legal
owner arrives at length, he will find the wilderness under cultivation,
and strangers quietly settled in the midst of his [[inheritance]]. *n

[footnote n: [this was speedily accomplished, and ere long both texas
and california formed part of the [[united]] states. the russian settlements
were acquired by purchase.]]

the lands [[land]] of the new [[world]] belong to the first occupant, and they are
the [[natural]] [[reward]] of the swiftest pioneer. even the countries [[country]] which are
already peopled will have some difficulty in securing themselves from
this [[invasion]]. i have already alluded to what is taking place in the
province of texas. the inhabitants of the [[united]] states are perpetually
migrating to texas, where they purchase [[land]]; and although they conform
to the laws [[law]] of the [[country]], they are gradually founding the [[empire]] of
their own [[language]] and their own manners. the province of texas is still
part of the mexican dominions, but it will soon contain no mexicans;
the same thing has occurred whenever the anglo-americans have come into
contact with populations of a different origin.

it cannot be denied that the british [[race]] has acquired an amazing
preponderance over all the other [[european]] races [[race]] in the new [[world]]; and
that it is very superior to them in [[civilization]], in industry, and in
power. as long as it is only surrounded by desert or thinly peopled
countries, as long as it encounters no dense populations upon its route,
through which it cannot [[work]] its way, it will assuredly continue to
spread. the lines marked out by treaties will not stop it; but it will
everywhere transgress these imaginary barriers.

the geographical position of the british [[race]] in the new [[world]] is
peculiarly favorable to its rapid increase. above its northern frontiers
the icy regions of the pole extend; and a few degrees [[degree]] below its southern
confines lies [[lie]] the burning [[climate]] of the equator. the anglo-americans
are, therefore, placed in the most temperate and habitable zone of the
continent.

it is generally supposed that the prodigious increase of [[population]] in
the [[united]] states is posterior to their declaration of independence. but
this is an error: the [[population]] increased as rapidly under the colonial
system as it does at the [[present]] day; that is to say, it doubled in
about twenty-two years. but this proportion which is now applied to
millions, was then applied to thousands of inhabitants; and the same
fact which was scarcely noticeable a century ago, is now evident to
every observer.

the british subjects [[subject]] in canada, who are dependent on a [[king]], augment and
spread almost as rapidly as the british settlers of the [[united]] states,
who [[live]] under a republican [[government]]. during the [[war]] of independence,
which lasted eight years, the [[population]] continued to increase without
intermission in the same ratio. although powerful [[indian]] nations allied
with the english existed at that [[time]] upon the western frontiers, the
emigration westward was never checked. whilst the [[enemy]] laid waste the
shores of the atlantic, kentucky, the western parts of pennsylvania, and
the states of vermont and of maine were filling with inhabitants. nor
did the unsettled [[state]] of the [[constitution]], which succeeded the [[war]],
prevent the increase of the [[population]], or stop its [[progress]] across the
wilds. thus, the difference of laws [[law]], the various conditions of [[peace]] and
war, of order and of [[anarchy]], have exercised no perceptible influence
upon the gradual [[development]] of the anglo-americans. this may be readily
understood; for the [[fact]] is, that no causes are sufficiently general
to exercise a simultaneous influence over the whole of so extensive a
territory. one portion of the [[country]] always offers a sure retreat from
the calamities which afflict another part; and however [[great]] may be the
evil, the remedy which is at hand is greater still.

it must not, then, be imagined that the impulse of the british [[race]] in
the new [[world]] can be arrested. the dismemberment of the union, and
the hostilities which might ensure, the abolition of republican
institutions, and the [[tyrannical]] [[government]] which might succeed it,
may retard this impulse, but they cannot prevent it from ultimately
fulfilling the destinies to which that [[race]] is reserved. no [[power]] upon
earth can close upon the emigrants that fertile wilderness which offers
resources to all industry, and a refuge from all want. future events,
of whatever [[nature]] they may be, will not deprive the americans of their
climate or of their inland seas, of their [[great]] rivers or of their
exuberant soil. nor will [[bad]] laws [[law]], revolutions [[revolution]], and [[anarchy]] be able to
obliterate that [[love]] of [[prosperity]] and that spirit of enterprise
which seem to be the distinctive characteristics of their [[race]], or to
extinguish that [[knowledge]] which guides them on their way.

thus, in the midst of the uncertain future, one event at least is sure.
at a period which may be said to be near (for we are speaking of the
life of a nation), the anglo-americans will alone cover the immense
space contained between the polar regions and the tropics, extending
from the coasts of the atlantic to the shores of the pacific ocean. the
territory which will probably be occupied by the anglo-americans at
some future [[time]], may be computed to [[equal]] three-quarters of [[europe]] in
extent. *o the [[climate]] of the union is upon the whole preferable to
that of [[europe]], and its [[natural]] advantages are not less [[great]]; it
is therefore evident that its [[population]] will at some future [[time]] be
proportionate to our own. [[europe]], divided as it is between so many
different nations, and torn as it has been by incessant wars [[war]] and the
barbarous manners of the middle ages [[age]], has notwithstanding attained a
population of 410 inhabitants to the square league. *p what cause can
prevent the [[united]] states from having as numerous a [[population]] in [[time]]?

[footnote o: the [[united]] states already extend over a territory [[equal]] to
one-half of [[europe]]. the area of [[europe]] is 500,000 square leagues, and
its [[population]] 205,000,000 of inhabitants. ("malte brun," liv. 114. vol.
vi. p. 4.)

[this computation is given in french leagues, which were in use when the
author wrote. twenty years later, in 1850, the superficial area of the
united states had been extended to 3,306,865 square miles of territory,
which is about the area of [[europe]].]]

[footnote p: see "malte brun," liv. 116, vol. vi. p. 92.]

many ages [[age]] must elapse before the divers offsets of the british [[race]] in
america cease to [[present]] the same homogeneous characteristics: and the
time cannot be foreseen at which a permanent inequality of conditions
will be established in the new [[world]]. whatever differences may arise,
from [[peace]] or from [[war]], from [[freedom]] or oppression, from [[prosperity]] or
want, between the destinies of the different descendants of the great
anglo-american [[family]], they will at least preserve an analogous social
condition, and they will hold in [[common]] the customs and the opinions [[opinion]] to
which that social condition has given birth.

in the middle ages [[age]], the tie of [[religion]] was sufficiently powerful
to imbue all the different populations of [[europe]] with the same
civilization. the british of the new [[world]] have a thousand other
reciprocal ties; and they [[live]] at a [[time]] when the tendency to equality
is general amongst [[mankind]]. the middle ages [[age]] were a period when
everything was broken up; when each [[people]], each province, each
city, and each [[family]], had a [[strong]] tendency to maintain its distinct
individuality. at the [[present]] [[time]] an opposite tendency seems to
prevail, and the nations seem to be advancing to unity. our means of
intellectual intercourse unite the most remote parts of the [[earth]]; and
it is impossible for [[men]] to remain strangers to each other, or to be
ignorant of the events which are taking place in any corner of the
globe. the consequence is that there is less difference, at the present
day, between the europeans [[european]] and their descendants in the new [[world]], than
there was between [[certain]] towns in the thirteenth century which were
only separated by a river. if this tendency to assimilation brings
foreign nations closer to each other, it must a fortiori prevent the
descendants of the same [[people]] from becoming aliens to each other.

the [[time]] will therefore come when one hundred and fifty millions of men
will be living in north [[america]], *q [[equal]] in condition, the progeny of
one [[race]], owing their origin to the same cause, and preserving the same
civilization, the same [[language]], the same [[religion]], the same habits, the
same manners, and imbued with the same opinions [[opinion]], propagated under the
same forms. the rest is uncertain, but this is [[certain]]; and it is a fact
new to the world--a [[fact]] fraught with such portentous consequences as to
baffle the efforts even of the [[imagination]].

[footnote q: this would be a [[population]] proportionate to that of [[europe]],
taken at a mean rate of 410 inhabitants to the square league.]

there are, at the [[present]] [[time]], two [[great]] nations in the [[world]] which
seem to tend towards the same end, although they started from different
points: i allude to the russians and the americans. both of them have
grown up unnoticed; and whilst the attention of [[mankind]] was directed
elsewhere, they have suddenly assumed a most prominent place amongst the
nations; and the [[world]] learned their existence and their greatness at
almost the same [[time]].

all other nations seem to have nearly reached their [[natural]] limits, and
only to be charged with the maintenance of their [[power]]; but these are
still in the act of [[growth]]; *r all the others are stopped, or continue
to advance with extreme difficulty; these are proceeding with ease and
with celerity along a path to which the [[human]] eye can assign no term.
the american struggles against the [[natural]] obstacles which oppose
him; the adversaries of the russian are [[men]]; the former combats the
wilderness and savage [[life]]; the latter, [[civilization]] with all its
weapons and its [[arts]]: the conquests of the one are therefore gained by
the ploughshare; those of the other by the [[sword]]. the anglo-american
relies upon personal interest to accomplish his ends, and gives free
scope to the unguided exertions and common-sense of the [[citizens]];
the russian centres all the [[authority]] of [[society]] in a [[single]] arm: the
principal instrument of the former is [[freedom]]; of the latter servitude.
their starting-point is different, and their courses are not the same;
yet each of them seems to be marked out by the will of [[heaven]] to sway
the destinies of half the globe.

[footnote r: russia is the [[country]] in the old [[world]] in which population
increases most rapidly in proportion.]
