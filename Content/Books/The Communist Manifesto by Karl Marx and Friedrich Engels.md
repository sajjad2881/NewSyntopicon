manifesto of the communist party

[from the english edition of 1888, edited by friedrich engels]


a spectre is haunting europe--the spectre of communism.
all the powers [[power]] of old [[europe]] have entered into a holy [[alliance]] to
exorcise this spectre: [[pope]] and czar, metternich and guizot,
french radicals and [[german]] police-spies.

where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as
communistic by its opponents in [[power]]?  where is the opposition
that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism,
against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against
its reactionary adversaries?

two things result from this [[fact]].

i.  communism is already acknowledged by all [[european]] powers
to be itself a [[power]].

ii.  it is high [[time]] that communists should openly, in the
face of the whole [[world]], publish their views, their aims, their
tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the spectre of
communism with a manifesto of the party itself.

to this end, communists of various nationalities have
assembled in [[london]], and sketched the following manifesto, to be
published in the english, french, [[german]], italian, flemish and
danish languages [[language]].



i.  bourgeois and proletarians

the [[history]] of all hitherto existing societies [[society]] is the history
of class struggles.

freeman and [[slave]], patrician and plebeian, [[lord]] and serf,
guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and [[oppressed]],
stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an
uninterrupted, now hidden, now open [[fight]], a [[fight]] that each time
ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of [[society]] at
large, or in the [[common]] ruin of the contending classes.

in the earlier epochs of [[history]], we find almost everywhere a
complicated arrangement of [[society]] into various orders, a
manifold gradation of social rank.  in ancient [[rome]] we have
patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves [[slave]]; in the middle ages [[age]],
feudal lords [[lord]], vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices,
serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate
gradations.

the [[modern]] bourgeois [[society]] that has sprouted from the ruins
of feudal [[society]] has not done away with class antagonisms.  it
has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression,
new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.  our epoch, the
epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive
feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. [[society]] as a
whole is more and more splitting up into two [[great]] hostile camps,
into two [[great]] classes, directly facing each other: bourgeoisie
and proletariat.

from the serfs of the middle ages [[age]] sprang the chartered burghers
of the earliest towns.  from these burgesses the first elements
of the bourgeoisie were developed.

the discovery of [[america]], the rounding of the cape, opened up
fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. the east-indian and
chinese markets, the colonisation of [[america]], [[trade]] with
the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in
commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to
industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the
revolutionary element in the tottering feudal [[society]], a rapid
development.

the feudal [[system]] of industry, under which industrial production
was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the
growing wants of the new markets.  the manufacturing [[system]] took
its place.  the guild-masters were pushed on one side by the
manufacturing middle class; division of [[labour]] between the
different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of
labour in each [[single]] workshop.

meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising.
even manufacture no longer sufficed.  thereupon, steam and
machinery revolutionised industrial production.  the place of
manufacture was taken by the giant, [[modern]] industry, the place of
the industrial middle class, by industrial millionaires, the
leaders of whole industrial armies [[army]], the [[modern]] bourgeois.

modern industry has established the world-market, for which the
discovery of [[america]] paved the way.  this market has given an
immense [[development]] to commerce, to navigation, to communication
by [[land]].  this [[development]] has, in its [[time]], reacted on the
extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce,
navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the
bourgeoisie developed, increased its [[capital]], and pushed into the
background  every class handed down from the middle ages [[age]].

we see, therefore, how the [[modern]] bourgeoisie is itself the
product of a long course of [[development]], of a series of
revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.

each step in the [[development]] of the bourgeoisie was accompanied
by a corresponding [[political]] advance of that class.  an
oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an
armed and self-governing association in the mediaeval commune;
here independent urban [[republic]] (as in [[italy]] and germany),
there taxable "third estate" of the [[monarchy]] (as in france),
afterwards, in the  period of manufacture proper, serving either
the semi-feudal or the absolute [[monarchy]] as a counterpoise
against the nobility, and, in [[fact]], corner-stone of the great
monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at [[last]], since the
establishment of [[modern]] industry and of the world-market,
conquered for itself, in the [[modern]] representative [[state]],
exclusive [[political]] sway.  the executive of the [[modern]] [[state]] is
but a committee for managing the [[common]] affairs of the whole
bourgeoisie.

the bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary
part.

the bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an
end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations.  it has
pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound [[man]] to
his "natural superiors," and has left remaining no other nexus
between [[man]] and [[man]] than naked self-interest, than callous "cash
payment."  it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of
religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine
sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation.  it
has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of
the numberless and indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that
single, unconscionable freedom--free [[trade]].  in one word, for
exploitation, veiled by [[religious]] and [[political]] illusions, naked,
shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

the bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation
hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe.  it has
converted the physician, the lawyer, the [[priest]], the poet, the
man of [[science]], into its paid wage labourers.

the bourgeoisie has torn away from the [[family]] its sentimental
veil, and has reduced the [[family]] relation to a mere money
relation.

the bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the
brutal display of vigour in the middle ages [[age]], which reactionists
so much [[admire]], found its fitting complement in the most slothful
indolence.  it has been the first to show what man's [[man]] activity can
bring about.  it has accomplished wonders far surpassing egyptian
pyramids, roman aqueducts, and gothic cathedrals; it has
conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses
of nations and crusades.

the bourgeoisie cannot [[exist]] without constantly revolutionising
the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of
production, and with them the whole relations of [[society]].
conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form,
was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all
earlier industrial classes. constant revolutionising of
production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions,
everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois
epoch from all earlier ones. all fixed, fast-frozen relations,
with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and
opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated
before they can ossify. all that is solid melts into air, all
that is holy is profaned, and [[man]] is at [[last]] compelled to face
with sober senses, his real conditions of [[life]], and his
relations with his [[kind]].

the need of a constantly expanding market for its products
chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. it
must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions
everywhere.

the bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market
given a cosmopolitan [[character]] to production and consumption in
every [[country]].  to the [[great]] chagrin of reactionists, it has
drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on
which it stood.  all old-established national industries have
been destroyed or are daily being destroyed.  they are dislodged
by new industries, whose introduction becomes a [[life]] and death
question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer
work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the
remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only
at [[home]], but in every quarter of the globe.  in place of the old
wants, satisfied by the productions of the [[country]], we find new
wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant
lands and climes.  in place of the old local and national
seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every
direction, universal inter-dependence of nations.  and as in
material, so also in intellectual production.  the intellectual
creations of [[individual]] nations become [[common]] [[property]].  national
one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more
impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures,
there arises a [[world]] literature.

the bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of
production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication,
draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation.
the cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with
which it batters down all chinese walls, with which it forces [[force]] the
barbarians' intensely obstinate [[hatred]] of foreigners to
capitulate.  it compels all nations, on [[pain]] of extinction, to
adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to
introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to
become bourgeois themselves.  in one word, it creates a world
after its own image.

the bourgeoisie has subjected the [[country]] to the [[rule]] of the
towns.  it has created enormous cities [[city]], has greatly increased the
urban [[population]] as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued
a considerable part of the [[population]] from the idiocy of rural
life.  just as it has made the [[country]] dependent on the towns, so
it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries [[country]] dependent on
the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois,
the east on the west.

the bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the
scattered [[state]] of the [[population]], of the means of production,
and of [[property]].  it has agglomerated production, and has
concentrated [[property]] in a few hands.  the necessary consequence
of this was [[political]] centralisation.  independent, or but
loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws [[law]],
governments and systems [[system]] of [[taxation]], became lumped together into
one nation, with one [[government]], one code of laws [[law]], one national
class-interest, one frontier and one customs-tariff.  the
bourgeoisie, during its [[rule]] of scarce one hundred years, has
created more massive and more colossal productive forces [[force]] than
have all preceding generations [[generation]] together.  subjection of nature's
forces to [[man]], machinery, application of chemistry to industry
and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs,
clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of
rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground--what
earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive
forces slumbered in the lap of social [[labour]]?

we see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose
foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in
feudal [[society]].  at a [[certain]] stage in the [[development]] of these
means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which
feudal [[society]] produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of
agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal
relations of [[property]] became no longer compatible with the
already developed productive forces [[force]]; they became so many fetters.
they had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.

into their place stepped [[free]] competition, accompanied by a
social and [[political]] [[constitution]] adapted to it, and by the
economical and [[political]] sway of the bourgeois class.

a similar movement is going on before our own [[eyes]].  modern
bourgeois [[society]] with its relations of production, of exchange
and of [[property]], a [[society]] that has conjured up such gigantic
means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is
no longer able to control the powers [[power]] of the nether [[world]] whom he
has called up by his spells.  for many a decade [[past]] the history
of industry and commerce is but the [[history]] of the revolt of
modern productive forces [[force]] against [[modern]] conditions of production,
against the [[property]] relations that are the conditions for the
existence of the bourgeoisie and of its [[rule]].  it is enough to
mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put
on its [[trial]], each [[time]] more threateningly, the existence of the
entire bourgeois [[society]].  in these crises a [[great]] part not only
of the existing products, but also of the previously created
productive forces [[force]], are periodically destroyed.  in these crises
there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would
have seemed an absurdity--the epidemic of over-production.
society suddenly finds itself put back into a [[state]] of momentary
barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal [[war]] of
devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence;
industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why?  because
there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence,
too much industry, too much commerce.  the productive forces [[force]] at
the disposal of [[society]] no longer tend to further the development
of the conditions of bourgeois [[property]]; on the contrary, they
have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are
fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring
disorder into the whole of bourgeois [[society]], endanger the
existence of bourgeois [[property]].  the conditions of bourgeois
society are too narrow to comprise the [[wealth]] created by them.
and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises?  on the one
hand inforced destruction of a mass of productive forces [[force]]; on the
other, by the [[conquest]] of new markets, and by the more thorough
exploitation of the old ones.  that is to say, by paving the
way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by
diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.

the [[weapons]] with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the
ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.

but not only has the bourgeoisie forged the [[weapons]] that bring
death to itself; it has also called into existence the [[men]] who
are to wield those weapons--the [[modern]] working class--the
proletarians.

in proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., [[capital]], is developed,
in the same proportion is the proletariat, the [[modern]] working
class, developed--a class of labourers, who [[live]] only so long
as they find [[work]], and who find [[work]] only so long as their labour
increases [[capital]].  these labourers, who must sell themselves
piece-meal, are a commodity, like every other article of
commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of
competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.

owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of
labour, the [[work]] of the proletarians has lost all individual
character, and consequently, all charm for the workman.  he
becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most
simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is
required of him.  hence, the cost of production of a workman is
restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he
requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his
race.  but the price of a commodity, and therefore also of
labour, is [[equal]] to its cost of production.  in proportion
therefore, as the repulsiveness of the [[work]] increases, the wage
decreases.  nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and
division of [[labour]] increases, in the same proportion the burden
of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working
hours, by increase of the [[work]] exacted in a given [[time]] or by
increased speed of the machinery, etc.

modern industry has converted the little workshop of the
patriarchal master into the [[great]] factory of the industrial
capitalist.  masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are
organised like soldiers.  as privates of the industrial [[army]] they
are placed under the command of a [[perfect]] hierarchy of officers
and sergeants.  not only are they slaves [[slave]] of the bourgeois class,
and of the bourgeois [[state]]; they are daily and hourly enslaved by
the machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the
individual bourgeois manufacturer himself.  the more openly this
despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty,
the more hateful and the more embittering it is.

the less the [[skill]] and exertion of [[strength]] implied in manual
labour, in other words, the more [[modern]] industry becomes
developed, the more is the [[labour]] of [[men]] superseded by that of
women. differences of [[age]] and [[sex]] have no longer any distinctive
social validity for the working class. all are instruments of
labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age
and [[sex]].

no sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer,
so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is
set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord,
the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.

the lower strata of the middle class--the small tradespeople,
shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and
peasants--all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly
because their diminutive [[capital]] does not suffice for the scale
on which [[modern]] industry is carried on, and is swamped in the
competition with the large capitalists, partly because their
specialized [[skill]] is rendered worthless by the new methods of
production.  thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes
of the [[population]].

the proletariat goes through various stages of [[development]].
with its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie.  at
first the contest is carried on by [[individual]] labourers, then by
the workpeople of a factory, then by the operatives of one [[trade]],
in one locality, against the [[individual]] bourgeois who directly
exploits them.  they direct their attacks not against the
bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments
of production themselves; they [[destroy]] imported wares that
compete with their [[labour]], they smash to pieces machinery, they
set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by [[force]] the vanished
status of the workman of the middle ages [[age]].

at this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass
scattered over the whole [[country]], and broken up by their mutual
competition.  if anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies [[body]],
this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of
the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its
own [[political]] ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in
motion, and is moreover yet, for a [[time]], able to do so.  at this
stage, therefore, the proletarians do not [[fight]] their enemies [[enemy]],
but the enemies [[enemy]] of their enemies [[enemy]], the remnants of absolute
monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty
bourgeoisie.  thus the whole historical movement is concentrated
in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every [[victory]] so obtained is a
victory for the bourgeoisie.

but with the [[development]] of industry the proletariat not only
increases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses,
its [[strength]] grows, and it feels [[feel]] that [[strength]] more.  the various
interests and conditions of [[life]] within the ranks of the
proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as
machinery obliterates all distinctions of [[labour]], and nearly
everywhere reduces wages to the same low level.  the growing
competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial
crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating.  the
unceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing,
makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions
between [[individual]] workmen and [[individual]] bourgeois take more and
more the [[character]] of collisions between two classes.  thereupon
the workers begin to form combinations (trades unions) against
the bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of
wages; they found permanent associations in order to make
provision beforehand for these occasional revolts.  here and
there the contest breaks out into riots.

now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a [[time]].
the real fruit of their battles [[battle]] lies [[lie]], not in the immediate
result, but in the ever-expanding union of the workers.  this
union is helped on by the improved means of communication that
are created by [[modern]] industry and that place the workers of
different localities in contact with one another.  it was just
this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local
struggles, all of the same [[character]], into one national struggle
between classes.  but every class struggle is a political
struggle.  and that union, to attain which the burghers of the
middle ages [[age]], with their miserable highways, required centuries,
the [[modern]] proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few
years.

this organisation of the proletarians into a class, and
consequently into a [[political]] party, is continually being upset
again by the competition between the workers themselves.  but it
ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.  it compels
legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers,
by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie
itself.  thus the ten-hours' bill in [[england]] was carried.

altogether collisions between the classes of the old society
further, in many ways, the course of [[development]] of the
proletariat. the bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant
battle. at first with the [[aristocracy]]; later on, with those
portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become
antagonistic to the [[progress]] of industry; at all times [[time]], with the
bourgeoisie of [[foreign]] countries [[country]]. in all these battles [[battle]] it sees
itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for its
help, and thus, to drag it into the [[political]] arena. the
bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its
own instruments of [[political]] and general [[education]], in other
words, it furnishes the proletariat with [[weapons]] for fighting
the bourgeoisie.

further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling
classes are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the
proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of
existence.  these also supply the proletariat with fresh elements
of enlightenment and [[progress]].

finally, in times [[time]] when the class struggle nears the decisive
hour, the process of dissolution going on within the ruling
class, in [[fact]] within the whole range of [[society]], assumes such a
violent, glaring [[character]], that a small section of the ruling
class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the
class that holds the future in its hands.  just as, therefore, at
an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the
bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the
proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois
ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of
comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole.

of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie
today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class.
the other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of
modern industry; the proletariat is its special and essential
product.  the lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the
shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these [[fight]] against the
bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions
of the middle class.  they are therefore not revolutionary, but
conservative.  nay more, they are reactionary, for they try
to roll back the wheel of [[history]].  if by [[chance]] they are
revolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending
transfer into the proletariat, they thus defend not their
present, but their future interests, they desert their own
standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.

the "dangerous class," the social scum, that passively rotting
mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old [[society]], may,
here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian
revolution; its conditions of [[life]], however, prepare it far more
for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.

in the conditions of the proletariat, those of old [[society]] at
large are already virtually swamped.  the proletarian is without
property; his relation to his [[wife]] and [[children]] has no longer
anything in [[common]] with the bourgeois family-relations; modern
industrial [[labour]], [[modern]] subjection to [[capital]], the same in
england as in [[france]], in [[america]] as in germany, has stripped him
of every trace of national [[character]].  [[law]], morality, [[religion]],
are to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in
ambush just as many bourgeois interests.

all the preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought to
fortify their already acquired status by subjecting [[society]] at
large to their conditions of appropriation.  the proletarians
cannot become masters of the productive forces [[force]] of [[society]], except
by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and
thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation.  they
have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission
is to [[destroy]] all previous securities for, and insurances of,
individual [[property]].

all previous historical movements were movements of minorities,
or in the interests of minorities.  the proletarian movement is
the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority,
in the interests of the immense majority.  the proletariat, the
lowest stratum of our [[present]] [[society]], cannot stir, cannot raise
itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official
society being sprung into the air.

though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the
proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle.
the proletariat of each [[country]] must, of course, first of all
settle matters with its own bourgeoisie.

in depicting the most general phases of the [[development]] of the
proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil [[war]], raging
within existing [[society]], up to the point where that [[war]] breaks
out into open [[revolution]], and where the [[violent]] overthrow of the
bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.

hitherto, every form of [[society]] has been based, as we have
already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed
classes.  but in order to [[oppress]] a class, [[certain]] conditions
must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its
slavish existence.  the serf, in the period of serfdom, raised
himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty
bourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to
develop into a bourgeois.  the [[modern]] laborer, on the contrary,
instead of rising with the [[progress]] of industry, sinks deeper and
deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class.  he
becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than
population and [[wealth]].  and here it becomes evident, that the
bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in
society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society
as an over-riding [[law]].  it is unfit to [[rule]] because it is
incompetent to assure an existence to its [[slave]] within his
slavery, because it cannot [[help]] letting him sink into such a
state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him.
society can no longer [[live]] under this bourgeoisie, in other
words, its existence is no longer compatible with [[society]].

the essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of
the bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of
capital; the condition for [[capital]] is wage-labour.  wage-labour
rests exclusively on competition between the laborers.  the
advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie,
replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition,
by their revolutionary combination, due to association.  the
development of [[modern]] industry, therefore, cuts from under its
feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces [[produce]] and
appropriates products.  what the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces [[produce]],
above all, is its own grave-diggers.  its fall and the [[victory]] of
the proletariat are equally inevitable.



ii.  proletarians and communists

in what relation do the communists stand to the proletarians as a
whole?

the communists do not form a separate party opposed to other
working-class parties.

they have no interests separate and apart from those of the
proletariat as a whole.

they do not set up any sectarian principles [[principle]] of their own,
by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.

the communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties
by this only: (1) in the national struggles of the proletarians
of the different countries [[country]], they point out and bring to the front
the [[common]] interests of the entire proletariat, independently of
all nationality.  (2) in the various stages of [[development]] which the
struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass
through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the
movement as a whole.

the communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically,
the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class
parties of every [[country]], that section which pushes forward
all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over
the [[great]] mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly
understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate
general results of the proletarian movement.

the immediate aim of the communist is the same as that of all
the other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into
a class, overthrow of the bourgeois [[supremacy]], [[conquest]] of
political [[power]] by the proletariat.

the theoretical conclusions of the communists are in no way
based on ideas [[idea]] or principles [[principle]] that have been [[invented]], or
discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.  they
merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from
an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on
under our very [[eyes]].  the abolition of existing property
relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism.

all [[property]] relations in the [[past]] have continually been subject
to historical [[change]] consequent upon the [[change]] in historical
conditions.

the french [[revolution]], for [[example]], abolished feudal [[property]] in
favour of bourgeois [[property]].

the distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of
property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois [[property]]. but
modern bourgeois private [[property]] is the final and most complete
expression of the [[system]] of producing and appropriating products,
that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the
many by the few.

in this sense, the theory of the communists may be summed up in
the [[single]] sentence: abolition of private [[property]].

we communists have been reproached with the [[desire]] of abolishing
the [[right]] of personally acquiring [[property]] as the fruit of a
man's own [[labour]], which [[property]] is alleged to be the groundwork
of all personal [[freedom]], activity and independence.

hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property!  do you mean the
property of the petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of
property that preceded the bourgeois form?  there is no need to
abolish that; the [[development]] of industry has to a [[great]] extent
already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.

or do you mean [[modern]] bourgeois private [[property]]?

but does wage-labour create any [[property]] for the labourer?  not
a bit.  it creates [[capital]], i.e., that [[kind]] of [[property]] which
exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon
condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh
exploitation.  [[property]], in its [[present]] form, is based on the
antagonism of [[capital]] and wage-labour.  let us examine both sides
of this antagonism.

to be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a
social status in production.  [[capital]] is a collective product,
and only by the [[united]] action of many members, nay, in the last
resort, only by the [[united]] action of all members of [[society]],
can it be set in motion.

capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social [[power]].

when, therefore, [[capital]] is converted into [[common]] [[property]], into
the [[property]] of all members of [[society]], personal [[property]] is not
thereby transformed into social [[property]]. it is only the social
character of the [[property]] that is changed. it loses its
class-character.

let us now take wage-labour.

the average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e.,
that quantum of the means of subsistence, which is absolutely
requisite in bare existence as a labourer.  what, therefore, the
wage-labourer appropriates by means of his [[labour]], merely
suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence.  we by no
means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the
products of [[labour]], an appropriation that is made for the
maintenance and reproduction of [[human]] [[life]], and that leaves no
surplus wherewith to command the [[labour]] of others.  all that we
want to do away with, is the miserable [[character]] of this
appropriation, under which the labourer lives [[life]] merely to increase
capital, and is allowed to [[live]] only in so far as the interest of
the ruling class requires it.

in bourgeois [[society]], living [[labour]] is but a means to increase
accumulated [[labour]].  in communist [[society]], accumulated labour
is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence
of the labourer.

in bourgeois [[society]], therefore, the [[past]] dominates the [[present]];
in communist [[society]], the [[present]] dominates the [[past]].  in
bourgeois [[society]] [[capital]] is independent and has individuality,
while the living [[person]] is dependent and has no individuality.

and the abolition of this [[state]] of things is called by the
bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! and rightly
so. the abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois
independence, and bourgeois [[freedom]] is undoubtedly aimed at.

by [[freedom]] is meant, under the [[present]] bourgeois conditions of
production, [[free]] [[trade]], [[free]] selling and buying.

but if selling and buying disappears, [[free]] selling and buying
disappears also.  this talk about [[free]] selling and buying, and
all the other "brave words" of our bourgeoisie about [[freedom]] in
general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted
selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the middle ages [[age]],
but have no meaning when opposed to the communistic abolition of
buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production,
and of the bourgeoisie itself.

you are horrified at our intending to do away with private
property.  but in your existing [[society]], private [[property]] is
already done away with for nine-tenths of the [[population]]; its
existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the
hands of those nine-tenths.  you reproach us, therefore, with
intending to do away with a form of [[property]], the necessary
condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any
property for the immense majority of [[society]].

in one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your
property.  precisely so; that is just what we intend.

from the moment when [[labour]] can no longer be converted into
capital, [[money]], or rent, into a social [[power]] capable of being
monopolised, i.e., from the moment when [[individual]] [[property]] can
no longer be transformed into bourgeois [[property]], into [[capital]],
from that moment, you say individuality vanishes.

you must, therefore, confess that by "individual" you mean no
other [[person]] than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of
property.  this [[person]] must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and
made impossible.

communism deprives no [[man]] of the [[power]] to appropriate the
products of [[society]]; all that it does is to deprive him of the
power to subjugate the [[labour]] of others by means of such
appropriation.

it has been objected that upon the abolition of private property
all [[work]] will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.

according to this, bourgeois [[society]] ought long ago to have gone
to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who
work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not
work. the whole of this objection is but another expression of
the tautology: that there can no longer be any wage-labour when
there is no longer any [[capital]].

all objections urged against the communistic mode of producing
and appropriating material products, have, in the same way,
been urged against the communistic modes of producing and
appropriating intellectual products.  just as, to the bourgeois,
the disappearance of class [[property]] is the disappearance of
production itself, so the disappearance of class [[culture]] is to
him identical with the disappearance of all [[culture]].

that [[culture]], the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous
majority, a mere training to act as a machine.

but don't wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended
abolition of bourgeois [[property]], the standard of your bourgeois
notions of [[freedom]], [[culture]], [[law]], etc.  your very ideas [[idea]] are but
the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and
bourgeois [[property]], just as your jurisprudence is but the will of
your class made into a [[law]] for all, a will, whose essential
character and direction are determined by the economical
conditions of existence of your class.

the selfish misconception that induces you to transform into
eternal laws [[law]] of [[nature]] and of [[reason]], the social forms
springing from your [[present]] mode of production and form of
property--historical relations that rise and disappear in the
progress of production--this misconception you share with every
ruling class that has preceded you.  what you see clearly in the
case of ancient [[property]], what you admit in the case of feudal
property, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of
your own bourgeois form of [[property]].

abolition of the family!  even the most radical flare up at this
infamous proposal of the communists.

on what foundation is the [[present]] [[family]], the bourgeois [[family]],
based?  on [[capital]], on private gain.  in its completely developed
form this [[family]] exists only among the bourgeoisie.  but this
state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of
the [[family]] among the proletarians, and in [[public]] prostitution.

the bourgeois [[family]] will vanish as a matter of course when its
complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of
capital.

do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of
children by their parents?  to this crime we plead guilty.

but, you will say, we [[destroy]] the most hallowed of relations,
when we replace [[home]] [[education]] by social.

and your education!  is not that also social, and determined by the
social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention,
direct or indirect, of [[society]], by means of schools, etc.?  the
communists have not [[invented]] the intervention of [[society]] in
education; they do but seek to alter the [[character]] of that
intervention, and to rescue [[education]] from the influence of the
ruling class.

the bourgeois clap-trap about the [[family]] and [[education]], about
the hallowed co-relation of parent and child, becomes all the
more disgusting, the more, by the action of [[modern]] industry, all
family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their
children transformed into simple articles of commerce and
instruments of [[labour]].

but you communists would introduce [[community]] of [[women]], screams
the whole bourgeoisie in chorus.

the bourgeois sees in his [[wife]] a mere instrument of production.
he hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited
in [[common]], and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than
that the lot of being [[common]] to all will likewise fall to the
women.

he has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away
with the status of [[women]] as mere instruments of production.

for the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the
virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the [[community]] of women
which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established
by the communists.  the communists have no need to introduce
community of [[women]]; it has existed almost from [[time]] immemorial.

our bourgeois, not content with having the wives [[wife]] and daughters
of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common
prostitutes, take the [[greatest]] [[pleasure]] in seducing each other's
wives.

bourgeois [[marriage]] is in reality a [[system]] of wives [[wife]] in common
and thus, at the most, what the communists might possibly
be reproached with, is that they [[desire]] to introduce, in
substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised
community of [[women]]. for the rest, it is self-evident that the
abolition of the [[present]] [[system]] of production must bring with it
the abolition of the [[community]] of [[women]] springing from that
system, i.e., of prostitution both [[public]] and private.

the communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish
countries and nationality.

the working [[men]] have no [[country]].  we cannot take from them what
they have not got.  since the proletariat must first of all
acquire [[political]] [[supremacy]], must rise to be the leading class of
the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far,
itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.

national differences and antagonisms between peoples [[people]] are daily
more and more vanishing, owing to the [[development]] of the
bourgeoisie, to [[freedom]] of commerce, to the world-market, to
uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of
life corresponding thereto.

the [[supremacy]] of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still
faster. [[united]] action, of the leading civilised countries [[country]] at
least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of
the proletariat.

in proportion as the exploitation of one [[individual]] by another
is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will
also be put an end to.  in proportion as the antagonism between
classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation
to another will come to an end.

the charges against communism made from a [[religious]], a
philosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint,
are not deserving of serious examination.

does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's [[man]] ideas [[idea]],
views and conceptions, in one word, man's [[man]] [[consciousness]], changes
with every [[change]] in the conditions of his material existence, in
his social relations and in his social [[life]]?

what else does the [[history]] of ideas [[idea]] prove, than that
intellectual production changes [[change]] its [[character]] in proportion as
material production is changed? the ruling ideas [[idea]] of each age
have ever been the ideas [[idea]] of its ruling class.

when [[people]] speak of ideas [[idea]] that revolutionise [[society]], they do
but express the [[fact]], that within the old [[society]], the elements
of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the
old ideas [[idea]] keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old
conditions of existence.

when the ancient [[world]] was in its [[last]] throes, the ancient
religions were overcome by [[christianity]].  when [[christian]] ideas
succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas [[idea]], feudal
society fought its [[death]] [[battle]] with the then revolutionary
bourgeoisie.  the ideas [[idea]] of [[religious]] [[liberty]] and [[freedom]] of
conscience merely gave expression to the sway of [[free]] competition
within the domain of [[knowledge]].

"undoubtedly," it will be said, "religious, [[moral]], philosophical
and juridical ideas [[idea]] have been modified in the course of
historical [[development]].  but [[religion]], morality [[philosophy]],
political [[science]], and [[law]], constantly survived this [[change]]."

"there are, besides, eternal truths [[truth]], such as [[freedom]], [[justice]],
etc. that are [[common]] to all states of [[society]]. but communism
abolishes eternal truths [[truth]], it abolishes all [[religion]], and all
morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it
therefore acts in contradiction to all [[past]] historical [[experience]]."

what does this accusation reduce itself to?  the [[history]] of
all [[past]] [[society]] has consisted in the [[development]] of class
antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at
different epochs.

but whatever form they may have taken, one [[fact]] is [[common]] to all
past ages [[age]], viz., the exploitation of one part of [[society]] by the
other. no wonder, then, that the social [[consciousness]] of past
ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays,
moves within [[certain]] [[common]] forms, or general ideas [[idea]], which
cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of
class antagonisms.

the communist [[revolution]] is the most radical rupture with
traditional [[property]] relations; no wonder that its development
involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas [[idea]].

but let us have done with the bourgeois objections to communism.

we have seen above, that the first step in the [[revolution]] by the
working class, is to raise the proletariat to the position of
ruling as to [[win]] the [[battle]] of [[democracy]].

the proletariat will use its [[political]] [[supremacy]] to wrest, by
degrees, all [[capital]] from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all
instruments of production in the hands of the [[state]], i.e., of the
proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the
total of productive forces [[force]] as rapidly as possible.

of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by
means of despotic inroads on the rights [[right]] of [[property]], and on
the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures,
therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable,
but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves,
necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are
unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of
production.

these measures will of course be different in different
countries.

nevertheless in the most advanced countries [[country]], the following will
be pretty generally applicable.

1.  abolition of [[property]] in [[land]] and application of all rents
    of [[land]] to [[public]] purposes [[purpose]].

2.  a heavy progressive or graduated income tax.

3.  abolition of all [[right]] of [[inheritance]].

4.  confiscation of the [[property]] of all emigrants and rebels.

5.  centralisation of credit in the hands of the [[state]], by means
    of a national bank with [[state]] [[capital]] and an exclusive
    [[monopoly]].

6.  centralisation of the means of communication and transport
    in the hands of the [[state]].

7.  extension of factories and instruments of production owned by
    the [[state]]; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and
    the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a
    [[common]] plan.

8.  [[equal]] liability of all to [[labour]].  establishment of
    industrial armies [[army]], especially for agriculture.

9.  combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries;
    gradual abolition of the distinction between town and
    [[country]], by a more equable distribution of the population
    over the [[country]].

10. [[free]] [[education]] for all [[children]] in [[public]] schools.
    abolition of children's factory [[labour]] in its [[present]] form.
    combination of [[education]] with industrial production, &c., &c.

when, in the course of [[development]], class distinctions have
disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the
hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the [[public]] power
will lose its [[political]] [[character]].  [[political]] [[power]], properly so
called, is merely the organised [[power]] of one class for oppressing
another.  if the proletariat during its contest with the
bourgeoisie is compelled, by the [[force]] of circumstances, to
organise itself as a class, if, by means of a [[revolution]], it
makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force
the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these
conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of
class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have
abolished its own [[supremacy]] as a class.

in place of the old bourgeois [[society]], with its classes and
class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which
the [[free]] [[development]] of each is the condition for the free
development of all.



iii.  socialist and communist literature


1. reactionary socialism


a. feudal socialism

owing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the
aristocracies of [[france]] and [[england]] to write pamphlets against
modern bourgeois [[society]].  in the french [[revolution]] of july 1830,
and in the english reform agitation, these aristocracies again
succumbed to the hateful upstart.  thenceforth, a serious political
contest was altogether out of the [[question]].  a literary battle
alone remained possible.  but even in the domain of literature
the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.

in order to arouse sympathy, the [[aristocracy]] were obliged to
lose sight, apparently, of their own interests, and to formulate
their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the
exploited working class alone.  thus the [[aristocracy]] took their
revenge by singing lampoons on their new master, and whispering
in his ears sinister prophecies of coming catastrophe.

in this way arose feudal socialism: half lamentation, half
lampoon; half echo of the [[past]], half menace of the future; at
times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the
bourgeoisie to the very heart's core; but always ludicrous in
its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of
modern [[history]].

the [[aristocracy]], in order to rally the [[people]] to them, waved the
proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner.  but the [[people]], so
often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal
coats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.

one section of the french legitimists and "young england"
exhibited this spectacle.

in pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to
that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they
exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite
different, and that are now antiquated.  in showing that, under
their [[rule]], the [[modern]] proletariat never existed, they forget
that the [[modern]] bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their
own form of [[society]].

for the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary
character of their criticism that their [[chief]] accusation against
the bourgeoisie amounts to this, that under the bourgeois regime
a class is being developed, which is destined to cut up root and
branch the old order of [[society]].

what they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it
creates a proletariat, as that it creates a revolutionary
proletariat.

in [[political]] practice, therefore, they join in all coercive
measures against the working class; and in ordinary [[life]],
despite their high falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the
golden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter
truth, [[love]], and [[honour]] for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and
potato spirits.

as the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord,
so has clerical socialism with feudal socialism.

nothing is easier than to give [[christian]] asceticism a socialist
tinge. has not [[christianity]] declaimed against private [[property]],
against [[marriage]], against the [[state]]? has it not preached in the
place of these, charity and [[poverty]], celibacy and mortification
of the flesh, monastic [[life]] and [[mother]] [[church]]? christian
socialism is but the holy water with which the [[priest]] consecrates
the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.


b. petty-bourgeois socialism

the feudal [[aristocracy]] was not the only class that was ruined by
the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence
pined and perished in the atmosphere of [[modern]] bourgeois [[society]].
the mediaeval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were
the precursors of the [[modern]] bourgeoisie.  in those countries
which are but little developed, industrially and commercially,
these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising
bourgeoisie.

in countries [[country]] where [[modern]] civilisation has become fully
developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed,
fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing
itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois [[society]].  the
individual members of this class, however, are being constantly
hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition,
and, as [[modern]] industry develops, they even see the moment
approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent
section of [[modern]] [[society]], to be replaced, in manufactures,
agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen.

in countries [[country]] like [[france]], where the peasants constitute far more
than half of the [[population]], it was [[natural]] that writers who
sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, should use,
in their criticism of the bourgeois regime, the standard of the
peasant and petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these
intermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working
class.  thus arose petty-bourgeois socialism.  sismondi was the
head of this school, not only in [[france]] but also in [[england]].

this school of socialism dissected with [[great]] acuteness the
contradictions in the conditions of [[modern]] production.  it laid
bare the hypocritical apologies of economists.  it proved,
incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and
division of [[labour]]; the concentration of [[capital]] and [[land]] in a
few hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the
inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery
of the proletariat, the [[anarchy]] in production, the crying
inequalities in the distribution of [[wealth]], the industrial [[war]] of
extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral
bonds, of the old [[family]] relations, of the old nationalities.

in its positive aims, however, this form of socialism aspires
either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange,
and with them the old [[property]] relations, and the old [[society]], or
to cramping the [[modern]] means of production and of exchange,
within the framework of the old [[property]] relations that have
been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means.  in either
case, it is both reactionary and utopian.

its [[last]] words are: corporate guilds for manufacture,
patriarchal relations in agriculture.

ultimately, when stubborn historical facts [[fact]] had dispersed all
intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of socialism
ended in a miserable fit of the blues.


c. [[german]], or "true," socialism

the socialist and communist literature of [[france]], a literature
that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in [[power]], and
that was the expression of the struggle against this [[power]], was
introduced into germany at a [[time]] when the bourgeoisie, in that
country, had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.

german [[philosophers]], would-be [[philosophers]], and beaux esprits,
eagerly seized on this literature, only forgetting, that when
these writings immigrated from [[france]] into germany, french social
conditions had not immigrated along with them.  in contact with
german social conditions, this french literature lost all its
immediate practical significance, and assumed a purely literary
aspect.  thus, to the [[german]] [[philosophers]] of the eighteenth
century, the demands of the first french [[revolution]] were nothing
more than the demands of "practical reason" in general, and the
utterance of the will of the revolutionary french bourgeoisie
signified in their [[eyes]] the [[law]] of pure will, of will as it was
bound to be, of true [[human]] will generally.

the [[world]] of the [[german]] literate consisted solely in bringing
the new french ideas [[idea]] into harmony with their ancient philosophical
conscience, or rather, in annexing the french ideas [[idea]] without
deserting their own philosophic point of view.

this annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign
language is appropriated, namely, by translation.

it is well known how the monks wrote silly lives [[life]] of catholic
saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works [[work]] of
ancient heathendom had been written.  the [[german]] literate
reversed this process with the profane french literature.  they
wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the french original.
for instance, beneath the french criticism of the economic
functions of [[money]], they wrote "alienation of [[humanity]]," and
beneath the french criticism of the bourgeois [[state]] they wrote
"dethronement of the category of the general," and so forth.

the introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of
the french historical criticisms they dubbed "philosophy of
action," "true socialism," "german [[science]] of socialism,"
"philosophical foundation of socialism," and so on.

the french socialist and communist literature was thus completely
emasculated. and, since it ceased in the hands of the [[german]] to express
the struggle of one class with the other, he [[felt]] conscious of having
overcome "french one-sidedness" and of representing, not true
requirements, but the requirements of [[truth]]; not the interests of the
proletariat, but the interests of [[human]] [[nature]], of [[man]] in general, who
belongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm
of philosophical fantasy.

this [[german]] socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously
and solemnly, and extolled its [[poor]] stock-in-trade in such
mountebank [[fashion]], meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic
innocence.

the [[fight]] of the [[german]], and especially, of the prussian bourgeoisie,
against feudal [[aristocracy]] and absolute [[monarchy]], in other words, the
liberal movement, became more earnest.

by this, the long wished-for opportunity was offered to "true"
socialism of confronting the [[political]] movement with the
socialist demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas
against liberalism, against representative [[government]], against
bourgeois competition, bourgeois [[freedom]] of the press, bourgeois
legislation, bourgeois [[liberty]] and equality, and of preaching to
the masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose,
by this bourgeois movement.  [[german]] socialism forgot, in the nick
of [[time]], that the french criticism, whose silly echo it was,
presupposed the existence of [[modern]] bourgeois [[society]], with its
corresponding economic conditions of existence, and the political
constitution adapted thereto, the very things whose attainment
was the object of the pending struggle in germany.

to the absolute governments [[government]], with their following of parsons,
professors, [[country]] squires and officials, it served as a welcome
scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie.

it was a sweet finish after the bitter pills of floggings and
bullets with which these same governments [[government]], just at that [[time]],
dosed the [[german]] working-class risings.

while this "true" socialism thus served the governments [[government]] as a
weapon for fighting the [[german]] bourgeoisie, it, at the same [[time]],
directly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of the
german philistines.  in germany the petty-bourgeois class, a
relic of the sixteenth century, and since then constantly
cropping up again under various forms, is the real social basis
of the existing [[state]] of things.

to preserve this class is to preserve the existing [[state]] of
things in germany.  the industrial and [[political]] [[supremacy]] of the
bourgeoisie threatens it with [[certain]] destruction; on the one
hand, from the concentration of [[capital]]; on the other, from the
rise of a revolutionary proletariat.  "true" socialism appeared to
kill these two birds with one stone.  it spread like an epidemic.

the robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers
of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this
transcendental robe in which the [[german]] socialists wrapped their
sorry "eternal truths [[truth]]," all skin and bone, served to wonderfully
increase the sale of their goods [[good]] amongst such a [[public]].  and on
its part, [[german]] socialism recognised, more and more, its own
calling as the bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois
philistine.

it proclaimed the [[german]] nation to be the model nation, and the
german petty philistine to be the typical [[man]].  to every
villainous meanness of this model [[man]] it gave a hidden, higher,
socialistic interpretation, the exact contrary of its real
character.  it went to the extreme length of directly opposing
the "brutally destructive" tendency of communism, and of
proclaiming its supreme and [[impartial]] contempt of all class
struggles.  with very few exceptions, all the so-called socialist
and communist publications that now (1847) circulate in germany
belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature.


2. conservative, or bourgeois, socialism

a part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social
grievances, in order to secure the continued existence of
bourgeois [[society]].

to this section belong economists, philanthropists,
humanitarians, improvers of the condition of the working class,
organisers of charity, members of societies [[society]] for the prevention of
cruelty to animals, temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner
reformers of every imaginable [[kind]].  this form of socialism has,
moreover, been worked out into complete systems [[system]].

we may cite proudhon's philosophie de la misere as an [[example]] of
this form.

the socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern
social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily
resulting therefrom.  they [[desire]] the existing [[state]] of society
minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements.  they wish
for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat.  the bourgeoisie
naturally conceives the [[world]] in which it is supreme to be the
best; and bourgeois socialism develops this comfortable
conception into various more or less complete systems [[system]].  in
requiring the proletariat to carry out such a [[system]], and thereby
to march straightway into the social new [[jerusalem]], it but
requires in reality, that the proletariat should remain within
the bounds of existing [[society]], but should cast away all its
hateful ideas [[idea]] concerning the bourgeoisie.

a second and more practical, but less systematic, form of this
socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in
the [[eyes]] of the working class, by showing that no mere political
reform, but only a [[change]] in the material conditions of
existence, in economic relations, could be of any advantage to
them.  by changes [[change]] in the material conditions of existence, this
form of socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of
the bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be
effected only by a [[revolution]], but administrative reforms, based
on the continued existence of these relations; reforms,
therefore, that in no [[respect]] affect the relations between
capital and [[labour]], but, at the [[best]], lessen the cost, and
simplify the administrative [[work]], of bourgeois [[government]].

bourgeois socialism attains adequate expression, when, and only
when, it becomes a mere figure of [[speech]].

free [[trade]]: for the benefit of the working class.  protective
duties: for the benefit of the working class.  prison reform: for
the benefit of the working class.  this is the [[last]] word and the
only seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism.

it is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois--for
the benefit of the working class.


3.  critical-utopian socialism and communism

we do not here refer to that literature which, in every great
modern [[revolution]], has always given voice to the demands of the
proletariat, such as the writings of babeuf and others.

the first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own
ends, made in times [[time]] of universal excitement, when feudal society
was being overthrown, these attempts necessarily failed, owing
to the then undeveloped [[state]] of the proletariat, as well as to
the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation,
conditions that had yet to be produced, and could be produced
by the impending bourgeois epoch alone. the revolutionary
literature that accompanied these first movements of the
proletariat had necessarily a reactionary [[character]]. it
inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its
crudest form.

the socialist and communist systems [[system]] properly so called, those of
saint-simon, fourier, owen and others, spring into existence in
the early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle
between proletariat and bourgeoisie (see section 1. bourgeois
and proletarians).

the founders of these systems [[system]] see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as
well as the action of the decomposing elements, in the prevailing form
of [[society]]. but the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them
the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any
independent [[political]] movement.

since the [[development]] of class antagonism keeps even pace with
the [[development]] of industry, the economic situation, as they find
it, does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the
emancipation of the proletariat.  they therefore search after a
new social [[science]], after new social laws [[law]], that are to create
these conditions.

historical action is to yield to their personal inventive
action, historically created conditions of emancipation to
fantastic ones, and the gradual, spontaneous class-organisation
of the proletariat to the organisation of [[society]] specially
contrived by these inventors.  future [[history]] resolves itself, in
their [[eyes]], into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of
their social plans.

in the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring
chiefly for the interests of the working class, as being the most
suffering class.  only from the point of view of being the most
suffering class does the proletariat [[exist]] for them.

the undeveloped [[state]] of the class struggle, as well as their
own surroundings, causes socialists of this [[kind]] to consider
themselves far superior to all class antagonisms.  they want to
improve the condition of every member of [[society]], even that of
the most favoured.  hence, they habitually appeal to [[society]] at
large, without  distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the
ruling class.  for how can [[people]], when once they understand
their [[system]], fail to see in it the [[best]] possible plan of the
best possible [[state]] of [[society]]?

hence, they reject all [[political]], and especially all
revolutionary, action; they [[wish]] to attain their ends by
peaceful means, and endeavour, by small experiments, necessarily
doomed to failure, and by the [[force]] of [[example]], to pave the way
for the new social gospel.

such fantastic pictures of future [[society]], painted at a time
when the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped [[state]] and has
but a fantastic conception of its own position correspond with
the first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general
reconstruction of [[society]].

but these socialist and communist publications contain also a
critical element. they attack every [[principle]] of existing [[society]].
hence they are full of the most valuable materials for the
enlightenment of the working class. the practical measures
proposed in them--such as the abolition of the distinction
between town and [[country]], of the [[family]], of the carrying on of
industries for the account of private individuals [[individual]], and of the wage
system, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the
functions of the [[state]] into a mere superintendence of production,
all these proposals, point solely to the disappearance of class
antagonisms which were, at that [[time]], only just cropping up, and
which, in these publications, are recognised in their earliest,
indistinct and undefined forms only. these proposals, therefore,
are of a purely utopian [[character]].

the significance of critical-utopian socialism and communism
bears an inverse relation to historical [[development]].  in
proportion as the [[modern]] class struggle develops and takes
definite shape, this fantastic standing apart from the contest,
these fantastic attacks on it, lose all practical value and all
theoretical justification.  therefore, although the originators
of these systems [[system]] were, in many respects [[respect]], revolutionary, their
disciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects.
they hold fast by the original views of their masters, in
opposition to the progressive historical [[development]] of the
proletariat.  they, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently,
to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms.
they still [[dream]] of experimental realisation of their social
utopias, of founding isolated "phalansteres," of establishing
"home colonies,"  of setting up a "little icaria"--duodecimo
editions of the new jerusalem--and to realise all these castles
in the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and
purses of the bourgeois.  by degrees [[degree]] they sink into the category
of the reactionary conservative socialists depicted above,
differing from these only by more systematic pedantry, and
by their fanatical and [[superstitious]] [[belief]] in the miraculous
effects of their social [[science]].

they, therefore, violently oppose all [[political]] action on the
part of the working class; such action, according to them, can
only result from blind unbelief in the new gospel.

the owenites in [[england]], and the fourierists in [[france]],
respectively, oppose the chartists and the reformistes.



iv.  position of the communists in relation to the
various existing opposition parties

section ii has made clear the relations of the communists to the
existing working-class parties, such as the chartists in england
and the agrarian reformers in [[america]].

the communists [[fight]] for the attainment of the immediate aims,
for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working
class; but in the movement of the [[present]], they also represent
and take [[care]] of the future of that movement.  in [[france]] the
communists ally themselves with the social-democrats, against the
conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the
right to take up a critical position in regard to phrases and
illusions traditionally handed down from the [[great]] [[revolution]].

in switzerland they support the radicals, without losing sight
of the [[fact]] that this party consists of antagonistic elements,
partly of democratic socialists, in the french sense, partly of
radical bourgeois.

in poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian
revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that
party which fomented the insurrection of cracow in 1846.

in germany they [[fight]] with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a
revolutionary way, against the absolute [[monarchy]], the feudal
squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.

but they never cease, for a [[single]] instant, to instil into the
working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile
antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the
german workers may straightaway use, as so many [[weapons]] against
the bourgeoisie, the social and [[political]] conditions that the
bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its [[supremacy]],
and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in
germany, the [[fight]] against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately
begin.

the communists turn their attention chiefly to germany, because
that [[country]] is on the eve of a bourgeois [[revolution]] that
is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions
of [[european]] civilisation, and with a much more developed
proletariat, than that of [[england]] was in the seventeenth, and of
france in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois
revolution in germany will be but the prelude to an immediately
following proletarian [[revolution]].

in short, the communists everywhere support every revolutionary
movement against the existing social and [[political]] order of
things.

in all these movements they bring to the front, as the leading
question in each, the [[property]] [[question]], no matter what its
degree of [[development]] at the [[time]].

finally, they [[labour]] everywhere for the union and agreement of
the democratic parties of all countries [[country]].

the communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.
they openly declare that their ends can be attained only by
the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.
let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic [[revolution]].
the proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.
they have a [[world]] to [[win]].


           working [[men]] of all countries [[country]], unite!
