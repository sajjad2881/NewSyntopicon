to my most honor’d friend mr. francis godolphin of godolphin


honor’d sir.

your most worthy [[brother]] mr sidney godolphin, when he lived, was pleas’d
to [[think]] my studies something, and otherwise to oblige me, as you [[know]],
with reall testimonies of his [[good]] [[opinion]], [[great]] in themselves, and the
greater for the worthinesse of his [[person]]. for there is not any vertue
that disposeth a [[man]], either to the service of [[god]], or to the service
of his [[country]], to civill [[society]], or private [[friendship]], that did not
manifestly appear in his conversation, not as acquired by necessity,
or affected upon [[occasion]], but inhaerent, and shining in a generous
constitution of his [[nature]]. therefore in [[honour]] and gratitude to him,
and with devotion to your selfe, i humbly dedicate unto you this my
discourse of common-wealth. i [[know]] not how the [[world]] will receive it,
nor how it may reflect on those that shall seem to favour it. for in a
way beset with those that contend on one side for too [[great]] [[liberty]], and
on the other side for too much [[authority]], ’tis hard to passe between the
points of both unwounded. but yet, me thinks [[think]], the endeavour to advance
the civill [[power]], should not be by the civill [[power]] condemned; nor
private [[men]], by reprehending it, declare they [[think]] that [[power]] too
great. besides, i speak not of the [[men]], but (in the abstract) of the
seat of [[power]], (like to those simple and unpartiall creatures in the
roman capitol, that with their noyse defended those within it, not
because they were they, but there) offending none, i [[think]], but those
without, or such within (if there be any such) as favour them. that
which perhaps may most offend, are [[certain]] texts of holy [[scripture]],
alledged by me to other [[purpose]] than ordinarily they use to be by
others. but i have done it with due submission, and also (in order to
my subject) necessarily; for they are the outworks of the [[enemy]], from
whence they impugne the civill [[power]]. if notwithstanding this, you find
my [[labour]] generally decryed, you may be pleased to excuse your selfe,
and say that i am a [[man]] that [[love]] my own opinions [[opinion]], and [[think]] all true i
say, that i honoured your [[brother]], and [[honour]] you, and have presum’d on
that, to assume the title (without your knowledge) of being, as i am,

sir,

your most humble, and most [[obedient]] servant, thomas hobbes.

the introduction


nature (the art [[arts]] whereby [[god]] hath made and governes the world) is by the
art of [[man]], as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it
can make an artificial animal. for seeing [[life]] is but a motion of limbs,
the begining whereof is in some principall part within; why may we not
say, that all automata (engines that move themselves by springs and
wheeles as doth a watch) have an artificiall [[life]]? for what is the
heart, but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the
joynts, but so many wheeles, giving motion to the whole [[body]], such as
was intended by the artificer? art [[arts]] goes yet further, imitating that
rationall and most excellent worke of [[nature]], [[man]]. for by art [[arts]] is created
that [[great]] leviathan called a common-wealth, or [[state]], (in latine
civitas) which is but an artificiall [[man]]; though of greater stature
and [[strength]] than the naturall, for whose protection and defence it
was intended; and in which, the soveraignty is an artificiall [[soul]], as
giving [[life]] and motion to the whole [[body]]; the magistrates, and other
officers of judicature and execution, artificiall joynts; [[reward]] and
punishment (by which fastned to the seat of the soveraignty, every joynt
and member is moved to performe his duty) are the nerves, that do the
same in the [[body]] naturall; the [[wealth]] and riches [[rich]] of all the particular
members, are the [[strength]]; salus populi (the peoples [[people]] safety) its
businesse; counsellors, by whom all things needfull for it to [[know]],
are suggested unto it, are the memory; equity and lawes, an artificiall
reason and will; concord, health; sedition, sicknesse; and civill [[war]],
death. lastly, the pacts and covenants, by which the parts of this body
politique were at first made, set together, and [[united]], resemble that
fiat, or the let us make [[man]], pronounced by [[god]] in the creation.

to describe the [[nature]] of this artificiall [[man]], i will consider

first the matter thereof, and the artificer; both which is [[man]].

secondly, how, and by what covenants it is made; what are the rights [[right]] and
just [[power]] or [[authority]] of a soveraigne; and what it is that preserveth
and dissolveth it.

thirdly, what is a [[christian]] common-wealth.

lastly, what is the kingdome of darkness.

concerning the first, there is a saying much usurped of late, that
wisedome is acquired, not by reading of books [[book]], but of [[men]]. consequently
whereunto, those persons [[person]], that for the most part can give no other proof
of being [[wise]], take [[great]] delight to shew what they [[think]] they have read
in [[men]], by uncharitable censures of one another behind their backs.
but there is another saying not of late understood, by which they might
learn truly to [[read]] one another, if they would take the pains [[pain]]; and that
is, nosce teipsum, [[read]] thy [[self]]: which was not meant, as it is now
used, to countenance, either the barbarous [[state]] of [[men]] in [[power]],
towards their inferiors; or to encourage [[men]] of low [[degree]], to a
sawcie behaviour towards their betters; but to [[teach]] us, that for the
similitude of the thoughts [[thought]], and [[passions]] of one [[man]], to the thoughts [[thought]],
and [[passions]] of another, whosoever looketh into himselfe, and
considereth what he doth, when he does [[think]], opine, [[reason]], [[hope]],
feare, &c, and upon what grounds; he shall thereby [[read]] and [[know]],
what are the thoughts [[thought]], and [[passions]] of all other [[men]], upon the like
occasions. i say the similitude of [[passions]], which are the same in all
men, [[desire]], feare, [[hope]], &c; not the similitude or the objects of the
passions, which are the things [[desired]], feared, hoped, &c: for these the
constitution individuall, and particular [[education]] do so vary, and they
are so easie to be kept from our [[knowledge]], that the characters [[character]] of mans
heart, blotted and confounded as they are, with dissembling, lying,
counterfeiting, and erroneous doctrines, are legible onely to him that
searcheth hearts [[heart]]. and though by mens [[men]] actions wee do discover their
designee sometimes; yet to do it without comparing them with our own,
and distinguishing all circumstances, by which the case may come to
be altered, is to decypher without a key, and be for the most part
deceived, by too much trust, or by too much diffidence; as he that
reads, is himselfe a [[good]] or evill [[man]].

but let one [[man]] [[read]] another by his actions never so perfectly, it
serves him onely with his acquaintance, which are but few. he that is
to govern a whole nation, must [[read]] in himselfe, not this, or that
particular [[man]]; but man-kind; which though it be hard to do, harder than
to learn any [[language]], or [[science]]; yet, when i shall have set down my
own reading orderly, and perspicuously, the pains [[pain]] left another, will be
onely to consider, if he also find not the same in himselfe. for this
kind of doctrine, admitteth no other demonstration.




part i.
of man




chapter i. of sense


concerning the thoughts [[thought]] of [[man]], i will consider them first singly, and
afterwards in trayne, or dependance upon one another. singly, they
are every one a representation or apparence, of some quality, or other
accident of a [[body]] without us; which is commonly called an object. which
object worketh on the [[eyes]], eares, and other parts of mans [[man]] [[body]]; and by
diversity of working, produceth [[diversity]] of apparences.

the originall of them all, is that which we call sense; (for there is
no conception in a mans [[man]] [[mind]], which hath not at first, totally, or by
parts, been begotten upon the organs of sense.) the rest are derived
from that originall.

to [[know]] the naturall cause of sense, is not very necessary to the
business now in hand; and i have els-where written of the same at large.
nevertheless, to fill each part of my [[present]] method, i will briefly
deliver the same in this place.

the cause of sense, is the externall [[body]], or object, which presseth the
organ proper to each sense, either immediatly, as in the tast and touch;
or mediately, as in seeing, hearing, and smelling: which pressure, by
the mediation of nerves, and other strings, and membranes of the [[body]],
continued inwards to the brain, and [[heart]], causeth there a [[resistance]],
or counter-pressure, or endeavour of the [[heart]], to deliver it [[self]]:
which endeavour because outward, seemeth to be some matter without. and
this seeming, or fancy, is that which [[men]] call sense; and consisteth, as
to the eye, in a [[light]], or colour figured; to the eare, in a sound; to
the nostrill, in an odour; to the tongue and palat, in a savour; and
to the rest of the [[body]], in heat, cold, hardnesse, softnesse, and such
other qualities, as we discern by feeling. all which qualities called
sensible, are in the object that causeth them, but so many several
motions of the matter, by which it presseth our organs diversly. neither
in us that are pressed, are they anything els, but divers motions; (for
motion, produceth nothing but motion.) but their apparence to us is
fancy, the same waking, that dreaming. and as pressing, rubbing,
or striking the eye, makes us fancy a [[light]]; and pressing the eare,
produceth a dinne; so do the bodies [[body]] also we see, or hear, [[produce]] the
same by their [[strong]], though unobserved action, for if those colours,
and sounds, were in the bodies [[body]], or objects that cause them, they could
not bee severed from them, as by glasses, and in ecchoes by reflection,
wee see they are; where we [[know]] the thing we see, is in one place; the
apparence, in another. and though at some [[certain]] distance, the reall,
and very object seem invested with the fancy it begets in us; yet still
the object is one thing, the image or fancy is another. so that sense in
all cases, is nothing els but originall fancy, caused (as i have said)
by the pressure, that is, by the motion, of externall things upon our
eyes, eares, and other organs thereunto ordained.

but the philosophy-schooles, through all the universities [[university]] of
christendome, grounded upon [[certain]] texts of [[aristotle]], [[teach]] another
doctrine; and say, for the cause of vision, that the thing seen, sendeth
forth on every side a visible species(in english) a visible shew,
apparition, or aspect, or a being seen; the receiving whereof into the
eye, is seeing. and for the cause of hearing, that the thing heard,
sendeth forth an audible [[species]], that is, an audible aspect, or audible
being seen; which entring at the eare, maketh hearing. nay for the
cause of understanding also, they say the thing understood sendeth forth
intelligible [[species]], that is, an intelligible being seen; which
comming into the understanding, makes us [[understand]]. i say not this,
as disapproving the use of universities [[university]]: but because i am to speak
hereafter of their office in a common-wealth, i must let you see on
all occasions [[occasion]] by the way, what things would be amended in them; amongst
which the frequency of insignificant [[speech]] is one.



chapter ii. of imagination


that when a thing lies [[lie]] still, unlesse somewhat els stirre it, it will
lye still for ever, is a [[truth]] that no [[man]] doubts [[doubt]] of. but that when a
thing is in motion, it will eternally be in motion, unless somewhat els
stay it, though the [[reason]] be the same, (namely, that nothing can change
it selfe,) is not so easily assented to. for [[men]] measure, not onely
other [[men]], but all other things, by themselves: and because they find
themselves [[subject]] after motion to [[pain]], and lassitude, [[think]] every
thing els growes weary of motion, and seeks repose of its own accord;
little considering, whether it be not some other motion, wherein that
desire of rest they find in themselves, consisteth. from hence it is,
that the schooles say, heavy bodies [[body]] fall downwards, out of an appetite
to rest, and to conserve their [[nature]] in that place which is most proper
for them; ascribing appetite, and [[knowledge]] of what is [[good]] for their
conservation, (which is more than [[man]] has) to things inanimate absurdly.

when a [[body]] is once in motion, it moveth (unless something els hinder
it) eternally; and whatsoever hindreth it, cannot in an instant, but in
time, and by degrees [[degree]] quite extinguish it: and as wee see in the water,
though the wind cease, the waves give not over rowling for a long
time after; so also it happeneth in that motion, which is made in the
internall parts of a [[man]], then, when he sees, dreams [[dream]], &c. for after the
object is removed, or the eye shut, wee still retain an image of the
thing seen, though more obscure than when we see it. and this is it,
that latines call [[imagination]], from the image made in seeing; and apply
the same, though improperly, to all the other senses. but the greeks
call it fancy; which signifies apparence, and is as proper to one sense,
as to another. [[imagination]] therefore is nothing but decaying sense; and
is found in [[men]], and many other living creatures, as well sleeping, as
waking.




memory

the decay of sense in [[men]] waking, is not the decay of the motion made in
sense; but an obscuring of it, in such manner, as the [[light]] of the sun
obscureth the [[light]] of the starres; which starrs do no less exercise
their vertue by which they are visible, in the day, than in the night.
but because amongst many stroaks, which our [[eyes]], eares, and other
organs receive from externall bodies [[body]], the predominant onely is sensible;
therefore the [[light]] of the sun being predominant, we are not affected
with the action of the starrs. and any object being removed from our
eyes, though the impression it made in us remain; yet other objects more
present succeeding, and working on us, the [[imagination]] of the [[past]] is
obscured, and made [[weak]]; as the voyce of a [[man]] is in the noyse of the
day. from whence it followeth, that the longer the [[time]] is, after the
sight, or sense of any object, the weaker is the [[imagination]]. for the
continuall [[change]] of mans [[man]] [[body]], destroyes in [[time]] the parts which in
sense were moved: so that the distance of [[time]], and of place, hath one
and the same effect in us. for as at a distance of place, that which wee
look at, appears dimme, and without distinction of the smaller parts;
and as voyces grow [[weak]], and inarticulate: so also after [[great]] distance
of [[time]], our [[imagination]] of the [[past]] is [[weak]]; and wee lose( for example)
of cities [[city]] wee have seen, many particular streets; and of actions, many
particular circumstances. this decaying sense, when wee would express
the thing it [[self]], (i mean fancy it selfe,) wee call [[imagination]], as i
said before; but when we would express the decay, and signifie that the
sense is fading, old, and [[past]], it is called memory. so that imagination
and memory, are but one thing, which for divers considerations hath
divers names.

much memory, or memory of many things, is called [[experience]]. againe,
imagination being only of those things which have been formerly
perceived by sense, either all at once, or by parts at severall
times; the former, (which is the imagining the whole object, as it was
presented to the sense) is simple [[imagination]]; as when one imagineth a
man, or horse, which he hath seen before. the other is compounded; as
when from the sight of a [[man]] at one [[time]], and of a horse at another, we
conceive in our [[mind]] a centaure. so when a [[man]] compoundeth the image of
his own [[person]], with the image of the actions of an other [[man]]; as when a
man imagins himselfe a hercules, or an alexander, (which happeneth often
to them that are much taken with reading of romants) it is a compound
imagination, and properly but a fiction of the [[mind]]. there be also other
imaginations that rise in [[men]], (though waking) from the [[great]] impression
made in sense; as from gazing upon the sun, the impression leaves an
image of the sun before our [[eyes]] a long [[time]] after; and from being long
and vehemently attent upon geometricall figures, a [[man]] shall in the
dark, (though awake) have the images of lines, and angles before his
eyes: which [[kind]] of fancy hath no particular name; as being a thing that
doth not commonly fall into mens [[men]] discourse.




dreams

the imaginations [[imagination]] of them that sleep, are those we call dreams [[dream]]. and these
also (as all other imaginations) have been before, either totally, or
by parcells in the sense. and because in sense, the brain, and nerves,
which are the necessary organs of sense, are so benummed in sleep, as
not easily to be moved by the action of externall objects, there can
happen in sleep, no [[imagination]]; and therefore no dreame, but what
proceeds from the agitation of the inward parts of mans [[man]] [[body]]; which
inward parts, for the connexion they have with the brayn, and other
organs, when they be distempered, do keep the same in motion; whereby
the imaginations [[imagination]] there formerly made, appeare as if a [[man]] were waking;
saving that the organs of sense being now benummed, so as there is
no new object, which can master and obscure them with a more vigorous
impression, a dreame must needs be more cleare, in this [[silence]] of
sense, than are our waking thoughts [[thought]]. and hence it cometh to pass, that
it is a hard matter, and by many [[thought]] impossible to distinguish
exactly between sense and dreaming. for my part, when i consider, that
in dreames, i do not often, nor constantly [[think]] of the same persons [[person]],
places, objects, and actions that i do waking; nor [[remember]] so long a
trayne of coherent thoughts [[thought]], dreaming, as at other times [[time]]; and because
waking i often observe the absurdity of dreames, but never [[dream]] of
the absurdities of my waking thoughts [[thought]]; i am well satisfied, that being
awake, i [[know]] i dreame not; though when i dreame, i [[think]] my selfe
awake.

and seeing dreames are caused by the distemper of some of the inward
parts of the [[body]]; divers distempers must needs cause different dreams [[dream]].
and hence it is, that lying cold breedeth dreams [[dream]] of feare, and raiseth
the [[thought]] and image of some fearfull object (the motion from the
brain to the inner parts, and from the inner parts to the brain being
reciprocall:) and that as anger causeth heat in some parts of the [[body]],
when we are awake; so when we sleep, the over heating of the same parts
causeth anger, and raiseth up in the brain the [[imagination]] of an [[enemy]].
in the same manner; as naturall [[kindness]], when we are awake causeth
desire; and [[desire]] makes heat in [[certain]] other parts of the [[body]]; so
also, too much heat in those parts, while wee sleep, raiseth in the
brain an [[imagination]] of some [[kindness]] shewn. in summe, our dreams [[dream]] are
the reverse of our waking imaginations [[imagination]]; the motion when we are awake,
beginning at one end; and when we [[dream]], at another.




apparitions or visions

the most difficult discerning of a mans [[man]] [[dream]], from his waking thoughts [[thought]],
is then, when by some accident we observe not that we have slept:
which is easie to happen to a [[man]] full of fearfull thoughts [[thought]]; and
whose [[conscience]] is much troubled; and that sleepeth, without the
circumstances, of going to bed, or putting off his clothes, as one that
noddeth in a chayre. for he that taketh pains [[pain]], and industriously layes
himselfe to sleep, in case any uncouth and exorbitant fancy come unto
him, cannot easily [[think]] it other than a [[dream]]. we [[read]] of marcus
brutes, (one that had his [[life]] given him by julius caesar, and was also
his favorite, and notwithstanding murthered him,) how at phillipi,
the night before he gave battell to augustus caesar, he saw a fearfull
apparition, which is commonly related by historians as a vision: but
considering the circumstances, one may easily [[judge]] to have been but
a short [[dream]]. for sitting in his tent, pensive and troubled with the
horrour of his rash act, it was not hard for him, slumbering in the
cold, to [[dream]] of that which most affrighted him; which feare, as by
degrees it made him wake; so also it must needs make the apparition by
degrees to vanish: and having no assurance that he slept, he could have
no cause to [[think]] it a [[dream]], or any thing but a vision. and this is no
very rare accident: for even they that be perfectly awake, if they be
timorous, and supperstitious, possessed with fearfull tales, and alone
in the dark, are [[subject]] to the like fancies, and [[believe]] they see
spirits and [[dead]] mens [[men]] ghosts walking in churchyards; whereas it is
either their fancy onely, or els the knavery of such persons [[person]], as make
use of such [[superstitious]] feare, to pass disguised in the night, to
places they would not be known to haunt.

from this ignorance of how to distinguish dreams [[dream]], and other strong
fancies, from vision and sense, did arise the [[greatest]] part of the
religion of the gentiles in [[time]] [[past]], that worshipped satyres, fawnes,
nymphs, and the like; and now adayes the [[opinion]] than rude [[people]] have
of fayries, ghosts, and goblins; and of the [[power]] of witches. for as for
witches, i [[think]] not that their witch craft is any reall [[power]]; but yet
that they are justly punished, for the false beliefe they have, that
they can do such mischiefe, joyned with their [[purpose]] to do it if they
can; their [[trade]] being neerer to a new [[religion]], than to a craft or
science. and for fayries, and walking ghosts, the [[opinion]] of them has i
think been on [[purpose]], either taught, or not confuted, to keep in
credit the use of exorcisme, of crosses, of holy water, and other such
inventions of ghostly [[men]]. neverthelesse, there is no [[doubt]], but [[god]] can
make unnaturall apparitions. but that he does it so often, as [[men]] need
to feare such things, more than they feare the stay, or [[change]], of the
course of [[nature]], which he also can stay, and [[change]], is no point of
christian [[faith]]. but evill [[men]] under pretext that [[god]] can do any thing,
are so bold as to say any thing when it serves their turn, though
they [[think]] it untrue; it is the part of a [[wise]] [[man]], to [[believe]] them no
further, than [[right]] [[reason]] makes that which they say, appear credible.
if this [[superstitious]] [[fear]] of spirits were taken away, and with it,
prognostiques from dreams [[dream]], false prophecies, and many other things
depending thereon, by which, crafty ambitious persons [[person]] [[abuse]] the
simple [[people]], [[men]] would be much more fitted than they are for civill
obedience.

and this ought to be the [[work]] of the schooles; but they rather nourish
such doctrine. for (not knowing what [[imagination]], or the senses are),
what they receive, they [[teach]]: some saying, that imaginations [[imagination]] rise of
themselves, and have no cause: others that they rise most commonly from
the will; and that [[good]] thoughts [[thought]] are blown (inspired) into a [[man]], by
god; and evill thoughts [[thought]] by the divell: or that [[good]] thoughts [[thought]] are powred
(infused) into a [[man]], by [[god]]; and evill ones by the divell. some say
the senses receive the [[species]] of things, and deliver them to the
common-sense; and the [[common]] sense delivers them over to the fancy, and
the fancy to the memory, and the memory to the judgement, like
handing of things from one to another, with many words making nothing
understood.




understanding

the [[imagination]] that is raysed in [[man]] (or any other creature indued with
the faculty of imagining) by words, or other voluntary signes, is that
we generally call understanding; and is [[common]] to [[man]] and beast. for a
dogge by custome will [[understand]] the call, or the rating of his master;
and so will many other beasts. that understanding which is peculiar to
man, is the understanding not onely his will; but his conceptions and
thoughts, by the sequell and contexture of the names of things into
affirmations, negations, and other formes of [[speech]]: and of this kinde
of understanding i shall speak hereafter.



chapter iii. of the consequence or trayne of imaginations


by consequence, or trayne of thoughts [[thought]], i [[understand]] that succession
of one [[thought]] to another, which is called (to distinguish it from
discourse in words) mentall discourse.

when a [[man]] thinketh on any thing whatsoever, his next [[thought]] after, is
not altogether so casuall as it seems to be. not every [[thought]] to every
thought succeeds indifferently. but as wee have no [[imagination]], whereof
we have not formerly had sense, in whole, or in parts; so we have no
transition from one [[imagination]] to another, whereof we never had the
like before in our senses. the [[reason]] whereof is this. all fancies
are motions within us, reliques of those made in the sense: and those
motions that immediately succeeded one another in the sense, continue
also together after sense: in so much as the former comming again to
take place, and be praedominant, the later followeth, by coherence of
the matter moved, is such manner, as water upon a plain table is drawn
which way any one part of it is guided by the finger. but because
in sense, to one and the same thing perceived, sometimes one thing,
sometimes another succeedeth, it comes to passe in [[time]], that in the
imagining of any thing, there is no certainty what we shall imagine
next; onely this is [[certain]], it shall be something that succeeded the
same before, at one [[time]] or another.




trayne of thoughts [[thought]] unguided

this trayne of thoughts [[thought]], or mentall discourse, is of two sorts. the
first is unguided, without designee, and inconstant; wherein there is no
passionate [[thought]], to govern and direct those that [[follow]], to it [[self]],
as the end and scope of some [[desire]], or other passion: in which case the
thoughts are said to wander, and seem impertinent one to another, as
in a [[dream]]. such are commonly the thoughts [[thought]] of [[men]], that are not onely
without company, but also without [[care]] of any thing; though even then
their thoughts [[thought]] are as busie as at other times [[time]], but without harmony; as
the sound which a lute out of tune would yeeld to any [[man]]; or in tune,
to one that could not play. and yet in this wild ranging of the [[mind]],
a [[man]] may oft-times perceive the way of it, and the dependance of one
thought upon another. for in a discourse of our [[present]] civill warre,
what could seem more impertinent, than to ask (as one did) what was the
value of a roman penny? yet the cohaerence to me was manifest enough.
for the [[thought]] of the warre, introduced the [[thought]] of the delivering
up the [[king]] to his enemies [[enemy]]; the [[thought]] of that, brought in the thought
of the delivering up of [[christ]]; and that again the [[thought]] of the 30
pence, which was the price of that [[treason]]: and thence easily followed
that malicious [[question]]; and all this in a moment of [[time]]; for thought
is quick.




trayne of thoughts [[thought]] regulated

the second is more constant; as being regulated by some [[desire]], and
designee. for the impression made by such things as wee [[desire]], or
feare, is [[strong]], and permanent, or, (if it cease for a [[time]],) of quick
return: so [[strong]] it is sometimes, as to hinder and break our sleep.
from [[desire]], ariseth the [[thought]] of some means we have seen [[produce]] the
like of that which we ayme at; and from the [[thought]] of that, the
thought of means to that mean; and so continually, till we come to some
beginning within our own [[power]]. and because the end, by the greatnesse
of the impression, comes often to [[mind]], in case our thoughts [[thought]] begin to
wander, they are quickly again reduced into the way: which observed by
one of the seven [[wise]] [[men]], made him give [[men]] this praecept, which is
now worne out, respice finem; that is to say, in all your actions,
look often upon what you would have, as the thing that directs all your
thoughts in the way to attain it.




remembrance

the trayn of regulated thoughts [[thought]] is of two kinds [[kind]]; one, when of an effect
imagined, wee seek the causes, or means that [[produce]] it: and this
is [[common]] to [[man]] and beast. the other is, when imagining any thing
whatsoever, wee seek all the possible effects, that can by it be
produced; that is to say, we imagine what we can do with it, when wee
have it. of which i have not at any [[time]] seen any signe, but in man
onely; for this is a curiosity hardly incident to the [[nature]] of any
living creature that has no other passion but sensuall, such as are
hunger, thirst, [[lust]], and anger. in summe, the discourse of the [[mind]],
when it is governed by designee, is nothing but seeking, or the faculty
of invention, which the latines call sagacitas, and solertia; a hunting
out of the causes, of some effect, [[present]] or [[past]]; or of the effects,
of some [[present]] or [[past]] cause, sometimes a [[man]] seeks what he hath lost;
and from that place, and [[time]], wherein hee misses it, his [[mind]] runs
back, from place to place, and [[time]] to [[time]], to find where, and when
he had it; that is to say, to find some [[certain]], and limited [[time]] and
place, in which to begin a method of seeking. again, from thence, his
thoughts run over the same places and times [[time]], to find what action, or
other [[occasion]] might make him lose it. this we call remembrance,
or calling to [[mind]]: the latines call it reminiscentia, as it were a
re-conning of our former actions.

sometimes a [[man]] knows [[know]] a place determinate, within the compasse whereof
his is to seek; and then his thoughts [[thought]] run over all the parts thereof,
in the same manner, as one would sweep a room, to find a jewell; or as
a spaniel ranges the field, till he find a sent; or as a [[man]] should run
over the alphabet, to start a rime.




prudence

sometime a [[man]] desires [[desire]] to [[know]] the event of an action; and then he
thinketh of some like action [[past]], and the events thereof one after
another; supposing like events will [[follow]] like actions. as he that
foresees what wil become of a [[criminal]], re-cons what he has seen follow
on the like crime before; having this order of thoughts [[thought]], the crime,
the officer, the prison, the [[judge]], and the gallowes. which kind
of thoughts [[thought]], is called foresight, and prudence, or providence; and
sometimes wisdome; though such conjecture, through the difficulty of
observing all circumstances, be very fallacious. but this is [[certain]]; by
how much one [[man]] has more [[experience]] of things [[past]], than another; by
so much also he is more prudent, and his expectations the seldomer faile
him. the [[present]] onely has a being in [[nature]]; things [[past]] have a being
in the memory onely, but things to come have no being at all; the future
being but a fiction of the [[mind]], applying the sequels of actions [[past]],
to the actions that are [[present]]; which with most certainty is done by
him that has most [[experience]]; but not with certainty enough. and though
it be called prudence, when the event answereth our expectation; yet in
its own [[nature]], it is but presumption. for the foresight of things to
come, which is providence, belongs onely to him by whose will they are
to come. from him onely, and supernaturally, proceeds prophecy. the best
prophet naturally is the [[best]] guesser; and the [[best]] guesser, he that is
most versed and [[studied]] in the matters he guesses at: for he hath most
signes to guesse by.




signes

a signe, is the event antecedent, of the consequent; and contrarily,
the consequent of the antecedent, when the like consequences have been
observed, before: and the oftner they have been observed, the lesse
uncertain is the signe. and therefore he that has most [[experience]] in
any [[kind]] of businesse, has most signes, whereby to guesse at the future
time, and consequently is the most prudent: and so much more prudent
than he that is new in that [[kind]] of [[business]], as not to be equalled by
any advantage of naturall and extemporary wit: though perhaps many young
men [[think]] the contrary.

neverthelesse it is not prudence that distinguisheth [[man]] from beast.
there be beasts, that at a year old observe more, and pursue that which
is for their [[good]], more prudently, than a child can do at ten.




conjecture of the [[time]] past

as prudence is a praesumtion of the future, contracted from the
experience of [[time]] [[past]]; so there is a praesumtion of things [[past]] taken
from other things (not future but) [[past]] also. for he that hath seen
by what courses and degrees [[degree]], a flourishing [[state]] hath first come into
civill warre, and then to ruine; upon the sights of the ruines of any
other [[state]], will guesse, the like warre, and the like courses have been
there also. but his conjecture, has the same incertainty almost with the
conjecture of the future; both being grounded onely upon [[experience]].

there is no other act of mans [[man]] [[mind]], that i can [[remember]], naturally
planted in him, so, as to need no other thing, to the exercise of it,
but to be born a [[man]], and [[live]] with the use of his five senses. those
other faculties, of which i shall speak by and by, and which seem proper
to [[man]] onely, are acquired, and encreased by study and industry; and of
most [[men]] learned by instruction, and discipline; and proceed all from
the invention of words, and [[speech]]. for besides sense, and thoughts [[thought]], and
the trayne of thoughts [[thought]], the [[mind]] of [[man]] has no other motion; though by
the [[help]] of [[speech]], and method, the same facultyes may be improved to
such a height, as to distinguish [[men]] from all other living creatures.

whatsoever we imagine, is finite. therefore there is no [[idea]], or
conception of anything we call infinite. no [[man]] can have in his [[mind]] an
image of infinite magnitude; nor conceive the ends, and bounds of
the thing named; having no conception of the thing, but of our own
inability. and therefore the name of [[god]] is used, not to make us
conceive him; (for he is incomprehensible; and his greatnesse, and power
are unconceivable;) but that we may [[honour]] him. also because whatsoever
(as i said before,) we conceive, has been perceived first by sense,
either all at once, or by parts; a [[man]] can have no [[thought]], representing
any thing, not [[subject]] to sense. no [[man]] therefore can conceive any
thing, but he must conceive it in some place; and indued with some
determinate magnitude; and which may be divided into parts; nor that any
thing is all in this place, and all in another place at the same [[time]];
nor that two, or more things can be in one, and the same place at once:
for none of these things ever have, or can be incident to sense; but are
absurd speeches [[speech]], taken upon credit (without any signification at all,)
from deceived [[philosophers]], and deceived, or deceiving schoolemen.



chapter iv. of speech




originall of speech

the invention of printing, though ingenious, compared with the invention
of letters, is no [[great]] matter. but who was the first that found the use
of letters, is not known. he that first brought them into greece, men
say was cadmus, the sonne of agenor, [[king]] of phaenicia. a profitable
invention for continuing the memory of [[time]] [[past]], and the conjunction of
mankind, dispersed into so many, and distant regions of the [[earth]]; and
with all difficult, as proceeding from a watchfull observation of the
divers motions of the tongue, palat, lips, and other organs of [[speech]];
whereby to make as many differences of characters [[character]], to [[remember]] them.
but the most [[noble]] and profitable invention of all other, was that of
speech, consisting of names or apellations, and their connexion; whereby
men register their thoughts [[thought]]; recall them when they are [[past]]; and also
declare them one to another for mutuall utility and conversation;
without which, there had been amongst [[men]], neither common-wealth, nor
society, nor contract, nor [[peace]], no more than amongst lyons, bears,
and wolves. the first author of [[speech]] was [[god]] himselfe, that instructed
adam how to name such creatures as he presented to his sight; for the
scripture goeth no further in this matter. but this was sufficient
to direct him to adde more names, as the [[experience]] and use of the
creatures should give him [[occasion]]; and to joyn them in such manner by
degrees, as to make himselfe understood; and so by succession of [[time]],
so much [[language]] might be gotten, as he had found use for; though not so
copious, as an orator or philosopher has need of. for i do not find any
thing in the [[scripture]], out of which, directly or by consequence can
be gathered, that adam was taught the names of all figures, numbers,
measures, colours, sounds, fancies, relations; much less the names
of words and [[speech]], as generall, speciall, affirmative, negative,
interrogative, optative, infinitive, all which are usefull; and least of
all, of entity, intentionality, quiddity, and other significant words of
the school.

but all this [[language]] gotten, and augmented by adam and his [[posterity]],
was again lost at the tower of babel, when by the hand of [[god]], every man
was stricken for his rebellion, with an oblivion of his former [[language]].
and being hereby forced to disperse themselves into severall parts of
the [[world]], it must needs be, that the [[diversity]] of tongues that now is,
proceeded by degrees [[degree]] from them, in such manner, as need (the [[mother]] of
all inventions) taught them; and in tract of [[time]] grew every where more
copious.




the use of speech

the generall use of [[speech]], is to transferre our mentall discourse, into
verbal; or the trayne of our thoughts [[thought]], into a trayne of words; and that
for two commodities; whereof one is, the registring of the consequences
of our thoughts [[thought]]; which being apt to slip out of our memory, and put
us to a new [[labour]], may again be recalled, by such words as they were
marked by. so that the first use of names, is to serve for markes,
or notes of remembrance. another is, when many use the same words,
to signifie (by their connexion and order,) one to another, what they
conceive, or [[think]] of each matter; and also what they [[desire]], feare,
or have any other passion for, and for this use they are called
signes. speciall uses of [[speech]] are these; first, to register, what by
cogitation, wee find to be the cause of any thing, [[present]] or [[past]]; and
what we find things [[present]] or [[past]] may [[produce]], or effect: which in
summe, is acquiring of [[arts]]. secondly, to shew to others that knowledge
which we have attained; which is, to counsell, and [[teach]] one another.
thirdly, to make known to others our wills, and purposes [[purpose]], that we may
have the mutuall [[help]] of one another. fourthly, to please and delight
our selves, and others, by playing with our words, for [[pleasure]] or
ornament, innocently.




abuses of speech

to these uses, there are also foure correspondent abuses [[abuse]]. first,
when [[men]] register their thoughts [[thought]] [[wrong]], by the inconstancy of the
signification of their words; by which they register for their
conceptions, that which they never conceived; and so [[deceive]] themselves.
secondly, when they use words metaphorically; that is, in other sense
than that they are ordained for; and thereby [[deceive]] others. thirdly,
when by words they declare that to be their will, which is not.
fourthly, when they use them to grieve one another: for seeing nature
hath armed living creatures, some with teeth, some with horns, and some
with hands, to grieve an [[enemy]], it is but an [[abuse]] of [[speech]], to grieve
him with the tongue, unlesse it be one whom wee are obliged to govern;
and then it is not to grieve, but to [[correct]] and amend.

the manner how [[speech]] serveth to the remembrance of the consequence
of causes and effects, consisteth in the imposing of names, and the
connexion of them.




names proper & [[common]] universall

of names, some are proper, and singular to one onely thing; as peter,
john, this [[man]], this tree: and some are [[common]] to many things; as [[man]],
horse, tree; every of which though but one name, is nevertheless the
name of divers particular things; in [[respect]] of all which together, it
is called an universall; there being nothing in the [[world]] universall
but names; for the things named, are every one of them [[individual]] and
singular.

one universall name is imposed on many things, for their similitude in
some quality, or other accident: and whereas a proper name bringeth to
mind one thing onely; universals recall any one of those many.

and of names universall, some are of more, and some of lesse extent; the
larger comprehending the lesse large: and some again of equall extent,
comprehending each other reciprocally. as for [[example]], the name [[body]] is
of larger signification than the word [[man]], and conprehendeth it; and the
names [[man]] and rationall, are of equall extent, comprehending mutually
one another. but here wee must take notice, that by a name is not
alwayes understood, as in grammar, one onely word; but sometimes by
circumlocution many words together. for all these words, hee that in
his actions observeth the lawes of his [[country]], make but one name,
equivalent to this one word, just.

by this imposition of names, some of larger, some of stricter
signification, we turn the reckoning of the consequences of things
imagined in the [[mind]], into a reckoning of the consequences of
appellations. for [[example]], a [[man]] that hath no use of [[speech]] at all,
(such, as is born and remains perfectly deafe and dumb,) if he set
before his [[eyes]] a triangle, and by it two [[right]] angles, (such as are the
corners of a square figure,) he may by meditation compare and find, that
the three angles of that triangle, are equall to those two [[right]] angles
that stand by it. but if another triangle be shewn him different in
shape from the former, he cannot [[know]] without a new [[labour]], whether the
three angles of that also be equall to the same. but he that hath the
use of words, when he observes, that such equality was consequent, not
to the length of the sides, nor to any other particular thing in his
triangle; but onely to this, that the sides were straight, and the
angles three; and that that was all, for which he named it a triangle;
will boldly conclude universally, that such equality of angles is in
all triangles whatsoever; and register his invention in these generall
termes, every triangle hath its three angles equall to two [[right]] angles.
and thus the consequence found in one particular, comes to be registred
and remembred, as a universall [[rule]]; and discharges our mentall
reckoning, of [[time]] and place; and delivers us from all [[labour]] of the
mind, saving the first; and makes that which was found true here, and
now, to be true in all times [[time]] and places.

but the use of words in registring our thoughts [[thought]], is in nothing so
evident as in numbering. a naturall foole that could never learn by
heart the order of numerall words, as one, two, and three, may observe
every stroak of the clock, and nod to it, or say one, one, one; but can
never [[know]] what houre it strikes. and it seems, there was a [[time]] when
those names of number were not in use; and [[men]] were fayn to apply their
fingers of one or both hands, to those things they [[desired]] to keep
account of; and that thence it proceeded, that now our numerall words
are but ten, in any nation, and in some but five, and then they begin
again. and he that can tell ten, if he recite them out of order, will
lose himselfe, and not [[know]] when he has done: much lesse will he be
able to add, and substract, and performe all other operations of
arithmetique. so that without words, there is no possibility of
reckoning of numbers; much lesse of magnitudes, of swiftnesse, of [[force]],
and other things, the reckonings whereof are necessary to the being, or
well-being of man-kind.

when two names are joyned together into a consequence, or affirmation;
as thus, a [[man]] is a living creature; or thus, if he be a [[man]], he is a
living creature, if the later name living creature, signifie all that
the former name [[man]] signifieth, then the affirmation, or consequence is
true; otherwise false. for true and false are attributes of [[speech]], not
of things. and where [[speech]] in not, there is neither [[truth]] nor falshood.
errour there may be, as when wee expect that which shall not be; or
suspect what has not been: but in neither case can a [[man]] be charged with
untruth.

seeing then that [[truth]] consisteth in the [[right]] ordering of names in our
affirmations, a [[man]] that seeketh precise [[truth]], had need to remember
what every name he uses stands for; and to place it accordingly; or els
he will find himselfe entangled in words, as a bird in lime-twiggs; the
more he struggles, the more belimed. and therefore in geometry, (which
is the onely [[science]] that it hath pleased [[god]] hitherto to bestow on
mankind,) [[men]] begin at settling the significations of their words; which
settling of significations, they call definitions; and place them in the
beginning of their reckoning.

by this it appears how necessary it is for any [[man]] that aspires to true
knowledge, to examine the definitions of former authors; and either
to [[correct]] them, where they are negligently set down; or to make them
himselfe. for the errours of definitions multiply themselves, according
as the reckoning proceeds; and lead [[men]] into absurdities, which at last
they see, but cannot avoyd, without reckoning anew from the beginning;
in which lyes the foundation of their errours. from whence it happens,
that they which trust to books [[book]], do as they that cast up many little
summs into a greater, without considering whether those little summes
were rightly cast up or not; and at [[last]] finding the errour visible,
and not mistrusting their first grounds, [[know]] not which way to cleere
themselves; but spend [[time]] in fluttering over their bookes; as birds
that entring by the chimney, and finding themselves inclosed in a
chamber, flitter at the false [[light]] of a glasse window, for want of wit
to consider which way they came in. so that in the [[right]] definition
of names, lyes the first use of [[speech]]; which is the acquisition of
science: and in [[wrong]], or no definitions’ lyes the first [[abuse]]; from
which proceed all false and senslesse tenets; which make those [[men]] that
take their instruction from the [[authority]] of books [[book]], and not from their
own meditation, to be as much below the condition of ignorant [[men]], as
men endued with true [[science]] are above it. for between true [[science]],
and erroneous doctrines, ignorance is in the middle. naturall sense and
imagination, are not [[subject]] to absurdity. [[nature]] it selfe cannot erre:
and as [[men]] abound in copiousnesse of [[language]]; so they become more [[wise]],
or more mad than ordinary. nor is it possible without letters for any
man to become either excellently [[wise]], or (unless his memory be hurt by
disease, or ill [[constitution]] of organs) excellently foolish. for words
are [[wise]] mens [[men]] counters, they do but reckon by them: but they are the
mony of fooles, that value them by the [[authority]] of an [[aristotle]], a
cicero, or a thomas, or any other doctor whatsoever, if but a [[man]].




subject to names

subject to names, is whatsoever can enter into, or be considered in an
account; and be added one to another to make a summe; or substracted one
from another, and leave a remainder. the latines called accounts of mony
rationes, and accounting, ratiocinatio: and that which we in bills or
books of account call items, they called nomina; that is, names: and
thence it seems to proceed, that they extended the word ratio, to the
faculty of reckoning in all other things. the greeks [[greek]] have but one word
logos, for both [[speech]] and [[reason]]; not that they [[thought]] there was no
speech without [[reason]]; but no reasoning without [[speech]]: and the act of
reasoning they called syllogisme; which signifieth summing up of the
consequences of one saying to another. and because the same things may
enter into account for divers accidents; their names are (to shew that
diversity) diversly wrested, and diversified. this [[diversity]] of names
may be reduced to foure generall heads.

first, a thing may enter into account for matter, or [[body]]; as living,
sensible, rationall, hot, cold, moved, quiet; with all which names the
word matter, or [[body]] is understood; all such, being names of matter.

secondly, it may enter into account, or be considered, for some accident
or quality, which we conceive to be in it; as for being moved, for being
so long, for being hot, &c; and then, of the name of the thing it selfe,
by a little [[change]] or wresting, wee make a name for that accident, which
we consider; and for living put into account [[life]]; for moved, motion;
for hot, heat; for long, length, and the like. and all such names, are
the names of the accidents and properties [[property]], by which one matter, and body
is distinguished from another. these are called names abstract; because
severed (not from matter, but) from the account of matter.

thirdly, we bring into account, the properties [[property]] of our own bodies [[body]],
whereby we make such distinction: as when any thing is seen by us, we
reckon not the thing it selfe; but the sight, the colour, the [[idea]] of
it in the fancy: and when any thing is heard, wee reckon it not; but the
hearing, or sound onely, which is our fancy or conception of it by the
eare: and such are names of fancies.

fourthly, we bring into account, consider, and give names, to names
themselves, and to speeches [[speech]]: for, generall, universall, speciall,
oequivocall, are names of names. and affirmation, interrogation,
commandement, narration, syllogisme, sermon, oration, and many other
such, are names of speeches [[speech]].




use of names positive

and this is all the variety of names positive; which are put to mark
somewhat which is in [[nature]], or may be feigned by the [[mind]] of [[man]], as
bodies that are, or may be conceived to be; or of bodies [[body]], the properties
that are, or may be feigned to be; or words and [[speech]].




negative names with their uses

there be also other names, called negative; which are notes to signifie
that a word is not the name of the thing in [[question]]; as these words
nothing, no [[man]], infinite, indocible, three want foure, and the
like; which are nevertheless of use in reckoning, or in correcting of
reckoning; and call to [[mind]] our [[past]] cogitations, though they be not
names of any thing; because they make us refuse to admit of names not
rightly used.




words insignificant

all other names, are but insignificant sounds; and those of two
sorts. one, when they are new, and yet their meaning not explained by
definition; whereof there have been aboundance coyned by schoole-men,
and pusled [[philosophers]].

another, when [[men]] make a name of two names, whose significations are
contradictory and inconsistent; as this name, an incorporeall [[body]], or
(which is all one) an incorporeall substance, and a [[great]] number more.
for whensoever any affirmation is false, the two names of which it
is composed, put together and made one, signifie nothing at all. for
example if it be a false affirmation to say a quadrangle is round,
the word round quadrangle signifies nothing; but is a meere sound. so
likewise if it be false, to say that vertue can be powred, or blown up
and down; the words in-powred vertue, in-blown vertue, are as absurd
and insignificant, as a round quadrangle. and therefore you shall hardly
meet with a senselesse and insignificant word, that is not made up of
some latin or [[greek]] names. a frenchman seldome hears our saviour called
by the name of parole, but by the name of verbe often; yet verbe and
parole differ no more, but that one is latin, the other french.




understanding

when a [[man]] upon the hearing of any [[speech]], hath those thoughts [[thought]] which the
words of that [[speech]], and their connexion, were ordained and constituted
to signifie; then he is said to [[understand]] it; understanding being
nothing els, but conception caused by [[speech]]. and therefore if speech
be peculiar to [[man]] (as for ought i [[know]] it is,) then is understanding
peculiar to him also. and therefore of absurd and false affirmations,
in case they be universall, there can be no understanding; though many
think they [[understand]], then, when they do but repeat the words softly,
or con them in their [[mind]].

what kinds [[kind]] of speeches [[speech]] signifie the appetites, aversions, and passions
of mans [[man]] [[mind]]; and of their use and [[abuse]], i shall speak when i have
spoken of the [[passions]].




inconstant names

the names of such things as affect us, that is, which please, and
displease us, because all [[men]] be not alike affected with the same thing,
nor the same [[man]] at all times [[time]], are in the [[common]] discourses of [[men]], of
inconstant signification. for seeing all names are imposed to signifie
our conceptions; and all our affections are but conceptions; when we
conceive the same things differently, we can hardly avoyd different
naming of them. for though the [[nature]] of that we conceive, be the
same; yet the [[diversity]] of our reception of it, in [[respect]] of different
constitutions of [[body]], and prejudices of [[opinion]], gives everything a
tincture of our different [[passions]]. and therefore in reasoning, a man
bust take heed of words; which besides the signification of what we
imagine of their [[nature]], disposition, and interest of the speaker; such
as are the names of vertues, and vices [[vice]]; for one [[man]] calleth wisdome,
what another calleth feare; and one [[cruelty]], what another [[justice]];
one prodigality, what another magnanimity; one gravity, what another
stupidity, &c. and therefore such names can never be true grounds of any
ratiocination. no more can metaphors, and tropes of [[speech]]: but these
are less dangerous, because they profess their inconstancy; which the
other do not.



chapter v. of [[reason]], and [[science]].




reason what it is

when a [[man]] reasoneth, hee does nothing els but conceive a summe totall,
from addition of parcels; or conceive a remainder, from substraction of
one summe from another: which (if it be done by words,) is conceiving of
the consequence of the names of all the parts, to the name of the whole;
or from the names of the whole and one part, to the name of the other
part. and though in some things, (as in numbers,) besides adding and
substracting, [[men]] name other operations, as multiplying and dividing;
yet they are the same; for multiplication, is but addition together of
things equall; and division, but substracting of one thing, as often as
we can. these operations are not incident to numbers onely, but to
all manner of things that can be added together, and taken one out of
another. for as arithmeticians [[teach]] to adde and substract in numbers;
so the geometricians [[teach]] the same in lines, figures (solid and
superficiall,) angles, proportions, times [[time]], degrees [[degree]] of swiftnesse, [[force]],
power, and the like; the logicians [[teach]] the same in consequences
of words; adding together two names, to make an affirmation; and two
affirmations, to make a syllogisme; and many syllogismes to make a
demonstration; and from the summe, or conclusion of a syllogisme, they
substract one proposition, to finde the other. writers of politiques,
adde together pactions, to find mens [[men]] duties [[duty]]; and lawyers, lawes and
facts, to find what is [[right]] and [[wrong]] in the actions of private [[men]].
in summe, in what matter soever there is place for addition and
substraction, there also is place for [[reason]]; and where these have no
place, there [[reason]] has nothing at all to do.




reason defined

out of all which we may define, (that is to say determine,) what that
is, which is meant by this word [[reason]], when wee reckon it amongst
the faculties of the [[mind]]. for [[reason]], in this sense, is nothing but
reckoning (that is, adding and substracting) of the consequences of
generall names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our
thoughts; i say marking them, when we reckon by our selves; and
signifying, when we demonstrate, or approve our reckonings to other [[men]].




right [[reason]] where

and as in arithmetique, unpractised [[men]] must, and professors themselves
may often erre, and cast up false; so also in any other [[subject]] of
reasoning, the ablest, most attentive, and most practised [[men]], may
deceive themselves, and inferre false conclusions; not but that reason
it selfe is always [[right]] [[reason]], as well as arithmetique is a certain
and infallible art [[arts]]: but no one mans [[man]] [[reason]], nor the [[reason]] of any
one number of [[men]], makes the certaintie; no more than an account is
therefore well cast up, because a [[great]] many [[men]] have unanimously
approved it. and therfore, as when there is a controversy in an account,
the parties must by their own accord, set up for [[right]] [[reason]], the
reason of some arbitrator, or [[judge]], to whose sentence they will
both stand, or their controversie must either come to blowes, or be
undecided, for want of a [[right]] [[reason]] constituted by [[nature]]; so is
it also in all debates of what [[kind]] soever: and when [[men]] that think
themselves wiser than all others, clamor and demand [[right]] [[reason]] for
judge; yet seek no more, but that things should be determined, by no
other mens [[men]] [[reason]] but their own, it is as intolerable in the [[society]] of
men, as it is in play after trump is turned, to use for trump on every
occasion, that suite whereof they have most in their hand. for they do
nothing els, that will have every of their [[passions]], as it comes to
bear sway in them, to be taken for [[right]] [[reason]], and that in their own
controversies: bewraying their want of [[right]] [[reason]], by the claym they
lay to it.




the use of reason

the use and end of [[reason]], is not the finding of the summe, and truth
of one, or a few consequences, remote from the first definitions, and
settled significations of names; but to begin at these; and proceed from
one consequence to another. for there can be no certainty of the last
conclusion, without a certainty of all those affirmations and negations,
on which it was grounded, and inferred. as when a master of a [[family]],
in taking an account, casteth up the summs of all the bills of expence,
into one sum; and not regarding how each bill is summed up, by those
that give them in account; nor what it is he payes for; he advantages
himselfe no more, than if he allowed the account in grosse, trusting to
every of the accountants [[skill]] and honesty; so also in reasoning of all
other things, he that takes up conclusions on the trust of authors, and
doth not fetch them from the first items in every reckoning, (which are
the significations of names settled by definitions), loses his [[labour]];
and does not [[know]] any thing; but onely beleeveth.




of error and absurdity

when a [[man]] reckons without the use of words, which may be done in
particular things, (as when upon the sight of any one thing, wee
conjecture what was likely to have preceded, or is likely to [[follow]] upon
it;) if that which he [[thought]] likely to [[follow]], followes not; or that
which he [[thought]] likely to have preceded it, hath not preceded it, this
is called error; to which even the most prudent [[men]] are [[subject]]. but
when we [[reason]] in words of generall signification, and fall upon a
generall inference which is false; though it be commonly called error,
it is indeed an absurdity, or senseless [[speech]]. for error is but a
deception, in presuming that somewhat is [[past]], or to come; of which,
though it were not [[past]], or not to come; yet there was no impossibility
discoverable. but when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a
true one, the possibility of it is unconceivable. and words whereby we
conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call absurd, insignificant,
and non-sense. and therefore if a [[man]] should talk to me of a round
quadrangle; or accidents of bread in cheese; or immaterial substances;
or of a [[free]] [[subject]]; a [[free]] will; or any [[free]], but [[free]] from being
hindred by opposition, i should not say he were in an errour; but that
his words were without meaning; that is to say, absurd.

i have said before, (in the second [[chapter]],) that a [[man]] did excell
all other animals in this faculty, that when he conceived any thing
whatsoever, he was apt to enquire the consequences of it, and what
effects he could do with it. and now i adde this other [[degree]] of the
same excellence, that he can by words reduce the consequences he findes
to generall rules [[rule]], called theoremes, or aphorismes; that is, he can
reason, or reckon, not onely in number; but in all other things, whereof
one may be added unto, or substracted from another.

but this priviledge, is allayed by another; and that is, by the
priviledge of absurdity; to which no living creature is [[subject]], but man
onely. and of [[men]], those are of all most [[subject]] to it, that professe
philosophy. for it is most true that cicero sayth of them somewhere;
that there can be nothing so absurd, but may be found in the books [[book]] of
philosophers. and the [[reason]] is manifest. for there is not one of them
that begins his ratiocination from the definitions, or explications of
the names they are to use; which is a method that hath been used onely
in geometry; whose conclusions have thereby been made indisputable.




causes of absurditie

the first cause of absurd conclusions i ascribe to the want of method;
in that they begin not their ratiocination from definitions; that
is, from settled significations of their words: as if they could cast
account, without knowing the value of the numerall words, one, two, and
three.

and whereas all bodies [[body]] enter into account upon divers considerations,
(which i have mentioned in the precedent [[chapter]];) these considerations
being diversly named, divers absurdities proceed from the confusion, and
unfit connexion of their names into assertions. and therefore

the second cause of absurd assertions, i ascribe to the giving of names
of bodies [[body]], to accidents; or of accidents, to bodies [[body]]; as they do, that
say, [[faith]] is infused, or inspired; when nothing can be powred, or
breathed into any thing, but [[body]]; and that, extension is [[body]]; that
phantasmes are spirits, &c.

the third i ascribe to the giving of the names of the accidents of
bodies without us, to the accidents of our own bodies [[body]]; as they do that
say, the colour is in the [[body]]; the sound is in the ayre, &c.

the fourth, to the giving of the names of bodies [[body]], to names, or speeches [[speech]];
as they do that say, that there be things universall; that a living
creature is genus, or a generall thing, &c.

the fifth, to the giving of the names of accidents, to names and
speeches; as they do that say, the [[nature]] of a thing is in its
definition; a mans [[man]] command is his will; and the like.

the sixth, to the use of metaphors, tropes, and other rhetoricall
figures, in stead of words proper. for though it be lawfull to say, (for
example) in [[common]] [[speech]], the way goeth, or leadeth hither, or thither,
the proverb sayes this or that (whereas wayes cannot go, nor proverbs
speak;) yet in reckoning, and seeking of [[truth]], such speeches [[speech]] are not to
be admitted.

the seventh, to names that signifie nothing; but are taken up, and
learned by rote from the schooles, as hypostatical, transubstantiate,
consubstantiate, eternal-now, and the like canting of schoole-men.

to him that can avoyd these things, it is not easie to fall into any
absurdity, unlesse it be by the length of an account; wherein he may
perhaps forget what went before. for all [[men]] by [[nature]] [[reason]] alike, and
well, when they have [[good]] principles [[principle]]. for who is so stupid, as both to
mistake in geometry, and also to persist in it, when another detects his
error to him?




science

by this it appears that [[reason]] is not as sense, and memory, borne with
us; nor gotten by [[experience]] onely; as prudence is; but attayned by
industry; first in apt imposing of names; and secondly by getting a good
and orderly method in proceeding from the elements, which are names,
to assertions made by connexion of one of them to another; and so to
syllogismes, which are the connexions of one assertion to another, till
we come to a [[knowledge]] of all the consequences of names appertaining to
the [[subject]] in hand; and that is it, [[men]] call [[science]]. and whereas
sense and memory are but [[knowledge]] of [[fact]], which is a thing [[past]], and
irrevocable; [[science]] is the [[knowledge]] of consequences, and dependance
of one [[fact]] upon another: by which, out of that we can presently do, we
know how to do something els when we will, or the like, another [[time]];
because when we see how any thing comes about, upon what causes, and by
what manner; when the like causes come into our [[power]], wee see how to
make it [[produce]] the like effects.

children therefore are not endued with [[reason]] at all, till they have
attained the use of [[speech]]: but are called reasonable creatures, for the
possibility apparent of having the use of [[reason]] in [[time]] to come. and
the most part of [[men]], though they have the use of reasoning a little
way, as in numbring to some [[degree]]; yet it serves them to little use in
common [[life]]; in which they govern themselves, some [[better]], some worse,
according to their differences of [[experience]], quicknesse of memory, and
inclinations to severall ends; but specially according to [[good]] or evill
fortune, and the errors of one another. for as for [[science]], or certain
rules of their actions, they are so farre from it, that they know
not what it is. geometry they have [[thought]] conjuring: but for other
sciences, they who have not been taught the beginnings, and some
progresse in them, that they may see how they be acquired and generated,
are in this point like [[children]], that having no [[thought]] of [[generation]],
are made [[believe]] by the [[women]], that their brothers [[brother]] and sisters are not
born, but found in the garden.

but yet they that have no [[science]], are in [[better]], and nobler condition
with their naturall prudence; than [[men]], that by mis-reasoning, or by
trusting them that [[reason]] [[wrong]], fall upon false and absurd generall
rules. for ignorance of causes, and of rules [[rule]], does not set [[men]] so farre
out of their way, as relying on false rules [[rule]], and taking for causes of
what they aspire to, those that are not so, but rather causes of the
contrary.

to conclude, the [[light]] of humane minds [[mind]] is perspicuous words, but by
exact definitions first snuffed, and purged from ambiguity; [[reason]] is
the pace; encrease of [[science]], the way; and the benefit of man-kind, the
end. and on the contrary, metaphors, and senslesse and ambiguous words,
are like ignes fatui; and reasoning upon them, is wandering amongst
innumerable absurdities; and their end, contention, and sedition, or
contempt.




prudence & sapience, with their difference

as, much [[experience]], is prudence; so, is much [[science]], sapience. for
though wee usually have one name of wisedome for them both; yet
the latines did always distinguish between prudentia and sapientia,
ascribing the former to [[experience]], the later to [[science]]. but to make
their difference appeare more cleerly, let us suppose one [[man]] endued
with an excellent naturall use, and dexterity in handling his armes; and
another to have added to that dexterity, an acquired [[science]], of where
he can offend, or be offended by his adversarie, in every possible
posture, or guard: the ability of the former, would be to the ability
of the later, as prudence to sapience; both usefull; but the later
infallible. but they that trusting onely to the [[authority]] of books [[book]],
follow the blind blindly, are like him that trusting to the false rules
of the master of fence, ventures praesumptuously upon an adversary, that
either kills, or disgraces him.




signes of science

the signes of [[science]], are some, [[certain]] and infallible; some,
uncertain. [[certain]], when he that pretendeth the [[science]] of any thing,
can [[teach]] the same; that is to say, demonstrate the [[truth]] thereof
perspicuously to another: uncertain, when onely some particular events
answer to his pretence, and upon many occasions [[occasion]] prove so as he sayes
they must. signes of prudence are all uncertain; because to observe by
experience, and [[remember]] all circumstances that may alter the successe,
is impossible. but in any businesse, whereof a [[man]] has not infallible
science to proceed by; to forsake his own [[natural]] judgement, and be
guided by generall sentences [[read]] in authors, and [[subject]] to many
exceptions, is a signe of folly, and generally scorned by the name of
pedantry. and even of those [[men]] themselves, that in councells of the
common-wealth, [[love]] to shew their reading of politiques and [[history]],
very few do it in their domestique affaires, where their particular
interest is concerned; having prudence enough for their private
affaires: but in publique they study more the [[reputation]] of their owne
wit, than the successe of anothers businesse.



chapter vi. of the interiour beginnings of voluntary motions

commonly called the [[passions]]. and the speeches [[speech]] by which they are
expressed.




motion vitall and animal

there be in animals, two sorts of motions peculiar to them: one called
vitall; begun in [[generation]], and continued without interruption through
their whole [[life]]; such as are the course of the bloud, the pulse, the
breathing, the concoctions, nutrition, excretion, &c; to which motions
there needs no [[help]] of [[imagination]]: the other in animal motion,
otherwise called voluntary motion; as to go, to speak, to move any of
our limbes, in such manner as is first fancied in our minds [[mind]]. that sense,
is motion in the organs and interiour parts of mans [[man]] [[body]], caused by
the action of the things we see, heare, &c.; and that fancy is but the
reliques of the same motion, remaining after sense, has been already
sayd in the first and second chapters [[chapter]]. and because going, speaking, and
the like voluntary motions, depend alwayes upon a precedent [[thought]] of
whither, which way, and what; it is evident, that the [[imagination]] is
the first internall beginning of all voluntary motion. and although
unstudied [[men]], doe not conceive any motion at all to be there, where
the thing moved is invisible; or the space it is moved in, is (for the
shortnesse of it) insensible; yet that doth not hinder, but that such
motions are. for let a space be never so little, that which is moved
over a greater space, whereof that little one is part, must first be
moved over that. these small beginnings of motion, within the body
of [[man]], before they appear in walking, speaking, striking, and other
visible actions, are commonly called endeavour.




endeavour; appetite; [[desire]]; [[hunger]]; thirst; aversion

this endeavour, when it is toward something which causes it, is called
appetite, or [[desire]]; the later, being the generall name; and the other,
oftentimes restrayned to signifie the [[desire]] of food, namely [[hunger]] and
thirst. and when the endeavour is fromward something, it is generally
called aversion. these words appetite, and aversion we have from the
latines; and they both of them signifie the motions, one of approaching,
the other of retiring. so also do the [[greek]] words for the same, which
are orme and aphorme. for [[nature]] it selfe does often presse upon men
those truths [[truth]], which afterwards, when they look for somewhat beyond
nature, they stumble at. for the schooles find in meere appetite to go,
or move, no actuall motion at all: but because some motion they must
acknowledge, they call it metaphoricall motion; which is but an absurd
speech; for though words may be called metaphoricall; bodies [[body]], and
motions cannot.

that which [[men]] [[desire]], they are also sayd to [[love]]; and to hate those
things, for which they have aversion. so that [[desire]], and [[love]], are the
same thing; save that by [[desire]], we alwayes signifie the absence of
the object; by [[love]], most commonly the presence of the same. so also
by aversion, we signifie the absence; and by hate, the presence of the
object.

of appetites, and aversions, some are born with [[men]]; as appetite of
food, appetite of excretion, and exoneration, (which may also and more
properly be called aversions, from somewhat they feele in their bodies [[body]];)
and some other appetites, not many. the rest, which are appetites of
particular things, proceed from [[experience]], and triall of their effects
upon themselves, or other [[men]]. for of things wee [[know]] not at all, or
believe not to be, we can have no further [[desire]], than to tast and try.
but aversion wee have for things, not onely which we [[know]] have hurt us;
but also that we do not [[know]] whether they will hurt us, or not.




contempt

those things which we neither [[desire]], nor hate, we are said to contemne:
contempt being nothing els but an immobility, or contumacy of the [[heart]],
in resisting the action of [[certain]] things; and proceeding from that the
heart is already moved otherwise, by either more potent objects; or from
want of [[experience]] of them.

and because the [[constitution]] of a mans [[man]] [[body]], is in continuall mutation;
it is impossible that all the same things should alwayes cause in him
the same appetites, and aversions: much lesse can all [[men]] [[consent]], in
the [[desire]] of almost any one and the same object.




good evill

but whatsoever is the object of any mans [[man]] appetite or [[desire]]; that is
it, which he for his part calleth [[good]]: and the object of his hate,
and aversion, evill; and of his contempt, vile, and inconsiderable.
for these words of [[good]], evill, and contemptible, are ever used with
relation to the [[person]] that useth them: there being nothing simply and
absolutely so; nor any [[common]] [[rule]] of [[good]] and evill, to be taken from
the [[nature]] of the objects themselves; but from the [[person]] of the man
(where there is no common-wealth;) or, (in a common-wealth,) from the
person that representeth it; or from an arbitrator or [[judge]], whom men
disagreeing shall by [[consent]] set up, and make his sentence the rule
thereof.




pulchrum turpe; delightfull profitable; unpleasant unprofitable

the latine tongue has two words, whose significations approach to
those of [[good]] and evill; but are not precisely the same; and those are
pulchrum and turpe. whereof the former signifies that, which by some
apparent signes promiseth [[good]]; and the later, that, which promiseth
evill. but in our tongue we have not so generall names to expresse them
by. but for pulchrum, we say in some things, fayre; in other beautifull,
or handsome, or gallant, or honourable, or comely, or amiable; and
for turpe, foule, deformed, ugly, base, nauseous, and the like, as the
subject shall require; all which words, in their proper places signifie
nothing els, but the mine, or countenance, that promiseth [[good]] and
evill. so that of [[good]] there be three kinds [[kind]]; [[good]] in the promise,
that is pulchrum; [[good]] in effect, as the end [[desired]], which is called
jucundum, delightfull; and [[good]] as the means, which is called utile,
profitable; and as many of evill: for evill, in promise, is that
they call turpe; evill in effect, and end, is molestum, unpleasant,
troublesome; and evill in the means, inutile, unprofitable, hurtfull.




delight displeasure

as, in sense, that which is really within us, is (as i have sayd
before) onely motion, caused by the action of externall objects, but in
apparence; to the sight, [[light]] and colour; to the eare, sound; to the
nostrill, odour, &c: so, when the action of the same object is continued
from the [[eyes]], eares, and other organs to the [[heart]]; the real effect
there is nothing but motion, or endeavour; which consisteth in appetite,
or aversion, to, or from the object moving. but the apparence, or sense
of that motion, is that wee either call delight, or trouble of [[mind]].




pleasure offence

this motion, which is called appetite, and for the apparence of it
delight, and [[pleasure]], seemeth to be, a corroboration of vitall motion,
and a [[help]] thereunto; and therefore such things as caused delight, were
not improperly called jucunda, (a juvando,) from helping or fortifying;
and the contrary, molesta, offensive, from hindering, and troubling the
motion vitall.

pleasure therefore, (or delight,) is the apparence, or sense of [[good]];
and molestation or displeasure, the apparence, or sense of evill. and
consequently all appetite, [[desire]], and [[love]], is accompanied with some
delight more or lesse; and all [[hatred]], and aversion, with more or lesse
displeasure and offence.




pleasures of sense; pleasures [[pleasure]] of the [[mind]]; joy paine griefe

of pleasures [[pleasure]], or delights, some arise from the sense of an object
present; and those may be called pleasures [[pleasure]] of sense, (the word sensuall,
as it is used by those onely that condemn them, having no place till
there be lawes.) of this [[kind]] are all onerations and exonerations of the
body; as also all that is pleasant, in the sight, hearing, smell,
tast, or touch; others arise from the expectation, that proceeds from
foresight of the end, or consequence of things; whether those things in
the sense please or displease: and these are pleasures [[pleasure]] of the [[mind]] of
him that draweth those consequences; and are generally called joy. in
the like manner, displeasures, are some in the sense, and called payne;
others, in the expectation of consequences, and are called griefe.

these simple [[passions]] called appetite, [[desire]], [[love]], aversion, hate,
joy, and griefe, have their names for divers considerations diversified.
as first, when they one succeed another, they are diversly called from
the [[opinion]] [[men]] have of the likelihood of attaining what they
desire. secondly, from the object loved or hated. thirdly, from the
consideration of many of them together. fourthly, from the alteration or
succession it selfe.


hope-- for appetite with an [[opinion]] of attaining, is called [[hope]].

despaire-- the same, without such [[opinion]], despaire.

feare-- aversion, with [[opinion]] of hurt from the object, feare.

courage-- the same, with [[hope]] of avoyding that hurt by [[resistance]],
courage.

anger-- sudden [[courage]], anger.

confidence-- constant [[hope]], confidence of our selves.

diffidence-- constant despayre, diffidence of our selves.

indignation-- anger for [[great]] hurt done to another, when we conceive the
same to be done by injury, indignation.

benevolence-- [[desire]] of [[good]] to another, benevolence, [[good]] will,
charity. if to [[man]] generally, [[good]] [[nature]].

covetousnesse-- [[desire]] of riches [[rich]], covetousnesse: a name used alwayes in
signification of blame; because [[men]] contending for them, are displeased
with one anothers attaining them; though the [[desire]] in it selfe, be to
be blamed, or allowed, according to the means by which those riches [[rich]] are
sought.

ambition-- [[desire]] of office, or precedence, [[ambition]]: a name used also
in the worse sense, for the [[reason]] before mentioned.

pusillanimity-- [[desire]] of things that conduce but a little to our ends;
and [[fear]] of things that are but of little hindrance, pusillanimity.

magnanimity-- contempt of little helps, and hindrances, magnanimity.

valour-- magnanimity, in danger of [[death]], or wounds, valour, fortitude.

liberality-- magnanimity in the use of riches [[rich]], liberality

miserablenesse-- pusillanimity, in the same wretchednesse,
miserablenesse; or parsimony; as it is liked or disliked.

kindnesse-- [[love]] of persons [[person]] for [[society]], kindnesse.

naturall lust-- [[love]] of persons [[person]] for pleasing the sense onely, natural
lust.

luxury-- [[love]] of the same, acquired from rumination, that is imagination
of [[pleasure]] [[past]], luxury.

the passion of [[love]]; jealousie-- [[love]] of one singularly, with [[desire]] to
be singularly beloved, the passion of [[love]]. the same, with [[fear]] that the
love is not mutuall, jealousie.

revengefulnesse-- [[desire]], by doing hurt to another, to make him condemn
some [[fact]] of his own, revengefulnesse.

curiosity-- [[desire]], to [[know]] why, and how, curiosity; such as is in no
living creature but [[man]]; so that [[man]] is distinguished, not onely by his
reason; but also by this singular passion from other animals; in whom
the appetite of food, and other pleasures [[pleasure]] of sense, by praedominance,
take away the [[care]] of knowing causes; which is a [[lust]] of the [[mind]],
that by a perseverance of delight in the continuall and indefatigable
generation of [[knowledge]], exceedeth the short vehemence of any carnall
pleasure.

religion superstition; true religion-- feare of [[power]] invisible, feigned
by the [[mind]], or imagined from tales publiquely allowed, [[religion]]; not
allowed, superstition. and when the [[power]] imagined is truly such as we
imagine, true [[religion]].

panique terrour-- feare, without the apprehension of why, or what,
panique terror; called so from the fables that make pan the author of
them; whereas in [[truth]] there is always in him that so feareth, first,
some apprehension of the cause, though the rest run away by [[example]];
every one supposing his fellow to [[know]] why. and therefore this passion
happens to none but in a throng, or multitude of [[people]].

admiration-- joy, from apprehension of novelty, admiration; proper to
man, because it excites the appetite of knowing the cause.

glory vaine-glory-- joy, arising from [[imagination]] of a man’s own power
and ability, is that exultation of the [[mind]] which is called glorying:
which, if grounded upon the [[experience]] of his own former actions, is
the same with confidence: but if grounded on the [[flattery]] of others, or
onely supposed by himselfe, for delight in the consequences of it,
is called vaine-glory: which name is properly given; because a
well-grounded confidence begetteth attempt; whereas the supposing of
power does not, and is therefore rightly called vaine.

dejection-- griefe, from [[opinion]] of want of [[power]], is called dejection
of [[mind]].

the vaine-glory which consisteth in the feigning or supposing of
abilities in ourselves, which we [[know]] are not, is most incident to young
men, and nourished by the histories [[history]] or fictions of gallant persons [[person]]; and
is corrected often times [[time]] by [[age]], and employment.

sudden [[glory]] laughter-- sudden [[glory]], is the passion which maketh those
grimaces called laughter; and is caused either by some sudden act of
their own, that pleaseth them; or by the apprehension of some
deformed thing in another, by comparison whereof they suddenly applaud
themselves. and it is incident most to them, that are conscious of the
fewest abilities in themselves; who are forced to keep themselves in
their own favour, by observing the imperfections of other [[men]].
and therefore much laughter at the defects of others is a signe of
pusillanimity. for of [[great]] minds [[mind]], one of the proper workes is, to help
and [[free]] others from scorn; and compare themselves onely with the most
able.

sudden dejection weeping-- on the contrary, sudden dejection is the
passion that causeth weeping; and is caused by such accidents, as
suddenly take away some vehement [[hope]], or some prop of their [[power]]: and
they are most [[subject]] to it, that rely principally on helps externall,
such as are [[women]], and [[children]]. therefore, some weep for the loss of
friends; others for their unkindnesse; others for the sudden stop made
to their thoughts [[thought]] of [[revenge]], by reconciliation. but in all cases, both
laughter and weeping, are sudden motions; custome taking them both away.
for no [[man]] laughs at old jests; or weeps for an old calamity.

shame blushing-- griefe, for the discovery of some defect of ability
is shame, or the passion that discovereth itself in blushing; and
consisteth in the apprehension of some thing dishonourable; and in young
men, is a signe of the [[love]] of [[good]] [[reputation]]; and commendable: in
old [[men]] it is a signe of the same; but because it comes too late, not
commendable.

impudence-- the contempt of [[good]] [[reputation]] is called impudence.

pitty-- griefe, for the calamity of another is pitty; and ariseth
from the [[imagination]] that the like calamity may befall himselfe; and
therefore is called also compassion, and in the phrase of this present
time a fellow-feeling: and therefore for calamity arriving from
great wickedness, the [[best]] [[men]] have the least pitty; and for the same
calamity, those have least pitty, that [[think]] themselves least obnoxious
to the same.

cruelty-- contempt, or little sense of the calamity of others, is that
which [[men]] call [[cruelty]]; proceeding from security of their own [[fortune]].
for, that any [[man]] should take [[pleasure]] in other mens’ [[great]] harmes,
without other end of his own, i do not conceive it possible.

emulation envy-- griefe, for the [[success]] of a competitor in [[wealth]],
honour, or other [[good]], if it be joyned with endeavour to enforce our own
abilities to [[equal]] or exceed him, is called emulation: but joyned with
endeavour to supplant or hinder a competitor, envie.

deliberation-- when in the [[mind]] of [[man]], appetites and aversions, hopes
and feares, concerning one and the same thing, arise alternately; and
divers [[good]] and evill consequences of the doing, or omitting the thing
propounded, come successively into our thoughts [[thought]]; so that sometimes we
have an appetite to it, sometimes an aversion from it; sometimes [[hope]] to
be able to do it; sometimes despaire, or feare to attempt it; the whole
sum of desires [[desire]], aversions, hopes [[hope]] and feares, continued till the thing be
either done, or [[thought]] impossible, is that we call deliberation.

therefore of things [[past]], there is no deliberation; because manifestly
impossible to be changed: nor of things known to be impossible, or
thought so; because [[men]] [[know]], or [[think]] such deliberation vaine. but
of things impossible, which we [[think]] possible, we may deliberate; not
knowing it is in [[vain]]. and it is called deliberation; because it is a
putting an end to the [[liberty]] we had of doing, or omitting, according to
our own appetite, or aversion.

this alternate succession of appetites, aversions, hopes [[hope]] and feares is
no less in other living creatures than in [[man]]; and therefore beasts also
deliberate.

every deliberation is then sayd to end when that whereof they
deliberate, is either done, or [[thought]] impossible; because till then wee
retain the [[liberty]] of doing, or omitting, according to our appetite, or
aversion.




the will

in deliberation, the [[last]] appetite, or aversion, immediately adhaering
to the action, or to the omission thereof, is that wee call the
will; the act, (not the faculty,) of willing. and beasts that have
deliberation must necessarily also have will. the definition of the
will, given commonly by the schooles, that it is a rationall appetite,
is not [[good]]. for if it were, then could there be no voluntary act
against [[reason]]. for a voluntary act is that, which proceedeth from the
will, and no other. but if in stead of a rationall appetite, we shall
say an appetite resulting from a precedent deliberation, then the
definition is the same that i have given here. will, therefore, is the
last appetite in deliberating. and though we say in [[common]] discourse, a
man had a will once to do a thing, that neverthelesse he forbore to
do; yet that is properly but an inclination, which makes no action
voluntary; because the action depends not of it, but of the last
inclination, or appetite. for if the intervenient appetites make any
action voluntary, then by the same [[reason]] all intervenient aversions
should make the same action involuntary; and so one and the same action
should be both voluntary & involuntary.

by this it is manifest, that not onely actions that have their beginning
from covetousness, [[ambition]], [[lust]], or other appetites to the thing
propounded; but also those that have their beginning from aversion,
or feare of those consequences that [[follow]] the omission, are voluntary
actions.




formes of [[speech]], in passion

the formes of [[speech]] by which the [[passions]] are expressed, are partly the
same, and partly different from those, by which we express our thoughts [[thought]].
and first generally all [[passions]] may be expressed indicatively; as, i
love, i feare, i joy, i deliberate, i will, i command: but some of them
have particular expressions by themselves, which nevertheless are not
affirmations, unless it be when they serve to make other inferences,
besides that of the passion they proceed from. deliberation is expressed
subjunctively; which is a [[speech]] proper to signifie suppositions, with
their consequences; as, if this be done, then this will [[follow]]; and
differs not from the [[language]] of reasoning, save that reasoning is in
generall words, but deliberation for the most part is of particulars.
the [[language]] of [[desire]], and aversion, is imperative; as, do this,
forbear that; which when the party is obliged to do, or forbear, is
command; otherwise prayer; or els counsell. the [[language]] of vaine-glory,
of indignation, pitty and revengefulness, optative: but of the [[desire]] to
know, there is a peculiar expression called interrogative; as, what is
it, when shall it, how is it done, and why so? other [[language]] of the
passions i find none: for cursing, swearing, reviling, and the like, do
not signifie as [[speech]]; but as the actions of a tongue accustomed.

these forms of [[speech]], i say, are expressions, or voluntary
significations of our [[passions]]: but [[certain]] signes they be not; because
they may be used arbitrarily, whether they that use them, have such
passions or not. the [[best]] signes of [[passions]] [[present]], are either in the
countenance, motions of the [[body]], actions, and ends, or aims, which we
otherwise [[know]] the [[man]] to have.




good and evill apparent

and because in deliberation the appetites and aversions are raised by
foresight of the [[good]] and evill consequences, and sequels of the action
whereof we deliberate; the [[good]] or evill effect thereof dependeth on the
foresight of a long chain of consequences, of which very seldome any man
is able to see to the end. but for so far as a [[man]] seeth, if the good
in those consequences be greater than the evill, the whole chain is that
which writers call apparent or seeming [[good]]. and contrarily, when the
evill exceedeth the [[good]], the whole is apparent or seeming evill: so
that he who hath by [[experience]], or [[reason]], the [[greatest]] and surest
prospect of consequences, deliberates [[best]] himself; and is able, when he
will, to give the [[best]] counsel unto others.




felicity

continual successe in obtaining those things which a [[man]] from [[time]] to
time desireth, that is to say, continual prospering, is that [[men]] call
felicity; i mean the felicity of this [[life]]. for there is no such thing
as perpetual tranquillity of [[mind]], while we [[live]] here; because life
itself is but motion, and can never be without [[desire]], nor without
feare, no more than without sense. what [[kind]] of felicity [[god]] hath
ordained to them that devoutly [[honour]] him, a [[man]] shall no sooner [[know]],
than enjoy; being joys, that now are as incomprehensible, as the word of
school-men, beatifical vision, is unintelligible.




praise magnification

the form of [[speech]] whereby [[men]] signifie their [[opinion]] of the goodnesse
of anything is [[praise]]. that whereby they signifie the [[power]] and
greatness of anything is magnifying. and that whereby they signifie
the [[opinion]] they have of a man’s felicity is by the greeks [[greek]] called
makarismos, for which we have no name in our tongue. and thus much is
sufficient for the [[present]] [[purpose]] to have been said of the [[passions]].



chapter vii. of the ends or resolutions of discourse


of all discourse, governed by [[desire]] of [[knowledge]], there is at last
an end, either by attaining, or by giving over. and in the chain of
discourse, wheresoever it be interrupted, there is an end for that [[time]].




judgement, or sentence final; doubt

if the discourse be meerly mentall, it consisteth of thoughts [[thought]] that the
thing will be, and will not be; or that it has been, and has not been,
alternately. so that wheresoever you break off the chayn of a mans
discourse, you leave him in a praesumption of it will be, or, it will
not be; or it has been, or, has not been. all which is [[opinion]]. and that
which is alternate appetite, in deliberating concerning [[good]] and [[evil]],
the same is alternate [[opinion]] in the enquiry of the [[truth]] of [[past]], and
future. and as the [[last]] appetite in deliberation is called the will, so
the [[last]] [[opinion]] in search of the [[truth]] of [[past]], and future, is called
the judgement, or resolute and final sentence of him that discourseth.
and as the whole chain of appetites alternate, in the [[question]] of good
or [[bad]] is called deliberation; so the whole chain of opinions [[opinion]] alternate,
in the [[question]] of true, or false is called [[doubt]].

no discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute [[knowledge]] of [[fact]], [[past]], or
to come. for, as for the [[knowledge]] of [[fact]], it is originally, sense; and
ever after, memory. and for the [[knowledge]] of consequence, which i have
said before is called [[science]], it is not absolute, but conditionall. no
man can [[know]] by discourse, that this, or that, is, has been, or will
be; which is to [[know]] absolutely: but onely, that if this be, that is; if
this has been, that has been; if this shall be, that shall be: which
is to [[know]] conditionally; and that not the consequence of one thing to
another; but of one name of a thing, to another name of the same thing.




science [[opinion]] conscience

and therefore, when the discourse is put into [[speech]], and begins with
the definitions of words, and proceeds by connexion of the same into
general affirmations, and of these again into syllogismes, the end or
last sum is called the conclusion; and the [[thought]] of the [[mind]] by it
signified is that conditional [[knowledge]], or [[knowledge]] of the consequence
of words, which is commonly called [[science]]. but if the first ground of
such discourse be not definitions, or if the definitions be not rightly
joyned together into syllogismes, then the end or conclusion is again
opinion, namely of the [[truth]] of somewhat said, though sometimes in
absurd and senslesse words, without possibility of being understood.
when two, or more [[men]], [[know]] of one and the same [[fact]], they are said
to be conscious of it one to another; which is as much as to [[know]] it
together. and because such are fittest witnesses of the facts [[fact]] of one
another, or of a third, it was, and ever will be reputed a very evill
act, for any [[man]] to speak against his [[conscience]]; or to [[corrupt]] or force
another so to do: insomuch that the plea of [[conscience]], has been always
hearkened unto very diligently in all times [[time]]. afterwards, [[men]] made use
of the same word metaphorically, for the [[knowledge]] of their own secret
facts, and secret thoughts [[thought]]; and therefore it is rhetorically said that
the [[conscience]] is a thousand witnesses. and [[last]] of all, [[men]], vehemently
in [[love]] with their own new opinions [[opinion]], (though never so absurd,) and
obstinately bent to maintain them, gave those their opinions [[opinion]] also that
reverenced name of [[conscience]], as if they would have it seem unlawful,
to [[change]] or speak against them; and so pretend to [[know]] they are true,
when they [[know]] at most but that they [[think]] so.




beliefe faith

when a mans [[man]] discourse beginneth not at definitions, it beginneth either
at some other contemplation of his own, and then it is still called
opinion; or it beginneth at some saying of another, of whose ability to
know the [[truth]], and of whose honesty in not deceiving, he doubteth
not; and then the discourse is not so much concerning the thing, as the
person; and the resolution is called beleefe, and [[faith]]: [[faith]], in the
man; beleefe, both of the [[man]], and of the [[truth]] of what he sayes. so
then in beleefe are two opinions [[opinion]]; one of the saying of the [[man]]; the
other of his vertue. to have [[faith]] in, or trust to, or beleeve a [[man]],
signifie the same thing; namely, an [[opinion]] of the veracity of the [[man]]:
but to beleeve what is said, signifieth onely an [[opinion]] of the truth
of the saying. but wee are to observe that this phrase, i beleeve in;
as also the latine, credo in; and the [[greek]], pisteno eis, are never used
but in the writings of divines. in stead of them, in other writings are
put, i beleeve him; i have [[faith]] in him; i rely on him: and in latin,
credo illi; fido illi: and in [[greek]], pisteno anto: and that this
singularity of the ecclesiastical use of the word hath raised many
disputes about the [[right]] object of the [[christian]] [[faith]].

but by beleeving in, as it is in the creed, is meant, not trust in the
person; but [[confession]] and acknowledgement of the doctrine. for not
onely christians [[christian]], but all manner of [[men]] do so [[believe]] in [[god]], as to hold
all for [[truth]] they heare him say, whether they [[understand]] it, or not;
which is all the [[faith]] and trust can possibly be had in any person
whatsoever: but they do not all [[believe]] the doctrine of the creed.

from whence we may inferre, that when wee [[believe]] any saying whatsoever
it be, to be true, from arguments taken, not from the thing it selfe, or
from the principles [[principle]] of naturall [[reason]], but from the [[authority]], and
good [[opinion]] wee have, of him that hath sayd it; then is the speaker, or
person we [[believe]] in, or trust in, and whose word we take, the object of
our [[faith]]; and the [[honour]] done in believing, is done to him onely. and
consequently, when wee [[believe]] that the scriptures [[scripture]] are the word of [[god]],
having no immediate revelation from [[god]] himselfe, our beleefe, [[faith]],
and trust is in the [[church]]; whose word we take, and acquiesce therein.
and they that [[believe]] that which a [[prophet]] relates unto them in the
name of [[god]], take the word of the [[prophet]], do [[honour]] to him, and in him
trust, and [[believe]], touching the [[truth]] of what he relateth, whether he
be a true, or a false [[prophet]]. and so it is also with all other [[history]].
for if i should not [[believe]] all that is written by historians, of the
glorious acts of alexander, or caesar; i do not [[think]] the ghost of
alexander, or caesar, had any just cause to be offended; or any body
else, but the historian. if livy say the gods made once a cow speak, and
we [[believe]] it not; wee distrust not [[god]] therein, but livy. so that it is
evident, that whatsoever we [[believe]], upon no other [[reason]], than what is
drawn from [[authority]] of [[men]] onely, and their writings; whether they be
sent from [[god]] or not, is [[faith]] in [[men]] onely.



chapter viii. of the vertues commonly called intellectual; and their
contrary defects




intellectuall vertue defined

vertue generally, in all sorts of subjects [[subject]], is somewhat that is valued
for eminence; and consisteth in comparison. for if all things
were equally in all [[men]], nothing would be prized. and by vertues
intellectuall, are always understood such abilityes of the [[mind]], as men
praise, value, and [[desire]] should be in themselves; and go commonly under
the name of a [[good]] witte; though the same word witte, be used also, to
distinguish one [[certain]] ability from the rest.




wit, naturall, or acquired

these vertues are of two sorts; naturall, and acquired. by naturall, i
mean not, that which a [[man]] hath from his birth: for that is nothing else
but sense; wherein [[men]] differ so little one from another, and from brute
beasts, as it is not to be reckoned amongst vertues. but i mean, that
witte, which is gotten by use onely, and [[experience]]; without method,
culture, or instruction. this naturall witte, consisteth principally
in two things; celerity of imagining, (that is, swift succession of one
thought to another;) and steddy direction to some approved end. on the
contrary a slow [[imagination]], maketh that defect, or [[fault]] of the [[mind]],
which is commonly called dulnesse, stupidity, and sometimes by other
names that signifie slownesse of motion, or difficulty to be moved.




good wit, or fancy; [[good]] judgement; discretion

and this difference of quicknesse, is caused by the difference of mens
passions; that [[love]] and dislike, some one thing, some another: and
therefore some mens [[men]] thoughts [[thought]] run one way, some another: and are held to,
and observe differently the things that passe through their [[imagination]].
and whereas in his succession of mens [[men]] thoughts [[thought]], there is nothing to
observe in the things they [[think]] on, but either in what they be like one
another, or in what they be unlike, or what they serve for, or how they
serve to such a [[purpose]]; those that observe their similitudes, in case
they be such as are but rarely observed by others, are sayd to have a
good wit; by which, in this [[occasion]], is meant a [[good]] fancy. but they
that observe their differences, and dissimilitudes; which is called
distinguishing, and discerning, and judging between thing and thing; in
case, such discerning be not easie, are said to have a [[good]] judgement:
and particularly in matter of conversation and businesse; wherein,
times, places, and persons [[person]] are to be discerned, this vertue is called
discretion. the former, that is, fancy, without the [[help]] of judgement,
is not commended as a vertue: but the later which is judgement, and
discretion, is commended for it selfe, without the [[help]] of fancy.
besides the discretion of times [[time]], places, and persons [[person]], necessary to a
good fancy, there is required also an often application of his thoughts
to their end; that is to say, to some use to be made of them. this done;
he that hath this vertue, will be easily fitted with similitudes, that
will please, not onely by illustration of his discourse, and adorning it
with new and apt metaphors; but also, by the rarity or their invention.
but without steddinesse, and direction to some end, a [[great]] fancy is one
kind of madnesse; such as they have, that entring into any discourse,
are snatched from their [[purpose]], by every thing that comes in their
thought, into so many, and so long digressions, and parentheses, that
they utterly lose themselves: which [[kind]] of folly, i [[know]] no particular
name for: but the cause of it is, sometimes want of [[experience]]; whereby
that seemeth to a [[man]] new and rare, which doth not so to others:
sometimes pusillanimity; by which that seems [[great]] to him, which other
men [[think]] a trifle: and whatsoever is new, or [[great]], and therefore
thought fit to be told, withdrawes a [[man]] by degrees [[degree]] from the intended
way of his discourse.

in a [[good]] poem, whether it be epique, or dramatique; as also in sonnets,
epigrams, and other pieces, both judgement and fancy are required:
but the fancy must be more eminent; because they please for the
extravagancy; but ought not to displease by indiscretion.

in a [[good]] [[history]], the judgement must be eminent; because the goodnesse
consisteth, in the method, in the [[truth]], and in the choyse of the
actions that are most profitable to be known. fancy has no place, but
onely in adorning the stile.

in orations of prayse, and in invectives, the fancy is praedominant;
because the designe is not [[truth]], but to [[honour]] or dishonour; which is
done by [[noble]], or by vile comparisons. the judgement does but suggest
what circumstances make an action laudable, or culpable.

in hortatives, and pleadings, as [[truth]], or [[disguise]] serveth [[best]] to the
designe in hand; so is the judgement, or the fancy most required.

in demonstration, in councell, and all rigourous search of [[truth]],
judgement does all; except sometimes the understanding have need to be
opened by some apt similitude; and then there is so much use of fancy.
but for metaphors, they are in this case utterly excluded. for seeing
they openly professe deceipt; to admit them into councell, or reasoning,
were manifest folly.

and in any discourse whatsoever, if the defect of discretion be
apparent, how extravagant soever the fancy be, the whole discourse
will be taken for a signe of want of wit; and so will it never when the
discretion is manifest, though the fancy be never so ordinary.

the secret thoughts [[thought]] of a [[man]] run over all things, holy, prophane,
clean, obscene, grave, and [[light]], without shame, or blame; which verball
discourse cannot do, farther than the judgement shall approve of the
time, place, and persons [[person]]. an anatomist, or a physitian may speak, or
write his judgement of unclean things; because it is not to please,
but [[profit]]: but for another [[man]] to write his extravagant, and pleasant
fancies of the same, is as if a [[man]], from being tumbled into the dirt,
should come and [[present]] himselfe before [[good]] company. and ’tis the want
of discretion that makes the difference. again, in profest remissnesse
of [[mind]], and familiar company, a [[man]] may play with the sounds, and
aequivocal significations of words; and that many times [[time]] with encounters
of extraordinary fancy: but in a sermon, or in publique, or before
persons unknown, or whom we ought to reverence, there is no gingling of
words that will not be accounted folly: and the difference is onely in
the want of discretion. so that where wit is wanting, it is not fancy
that is wanting, but discretion. judgement therefore without fancy is
wit, but fancy without judgement not.




prudence

when the thoughts [[thought]] of a [[man]], that has a designe in hand, running over a
multitude of things, observes how they conduce to that designe; or what
designe they may conduce into; if his observations be such as are not
easie, or usuall, this wit of his is called prudence; and dependeth on
much [[experience]], and memory of the like things, and their consequences
heretofore. in which there is not so much difference of [[men]], as there is
in their fancies and judgements; because the [[experience]] of [[men]] equall
in [[age]], is not much unequall, as to the quantity; but lyes in different
occasions; every one having his private designes. to govern well a
family, and a kingdome, are not different degrees [[degree]] of prudence; but
different sorts of businesse; no more then to draw a picture in little,
or as [[great]], or greater then the [[life]], are different degrees [[degree]] of art [[arts]]. a
plain husband-man is more prudent in affaires of his own house, then a
privy counseller in the affaires of another [[man]].




craft

to prudence, if you adde the use of [[unjust]], or dishonest means, such
as usually are prompted to [[men]] by feare, or want; you have that crooked
wisdome, which is called craft; which is a signe of pusillanimity. for
magnanimity is contempt of [[unjust]], or dishonest helps. and that which
the latines call versutia, (translated into english, shifting,) and is
a putting off of a [[present]] danger or incommodity, by engaging into
a greater, as when a [[man]] robbs one to [[pay]] another, is but a shorter
sighted craft, called versutia, from versura, which signifies taking
mony at usurie, for the [[present]] payment of interest.




acquired wit

as for acquired wit, (i mean acquired by method and instruction,) there
is none but [[reason]]; which is grounded on the [[right]] use of [[speech]]; and
produceth the sciences [[science]]. but of [[reason]] and [[science]], i have already spoken
in the fifth and sixth chapters [[chapter]].

the causes of this difference of witts, are in the [[passions]]: and
the difference of [[passions]], proceedeth partly from the different
constitution of the [[body]], and partly from different [[education]]. for if
the difference proceeded from the temper of the brain, and the organs of
sense, either exterior or interior, there would be no lesse difference
of [[men]] in their sight, hearing, or other senses, than in their fancies,
and discretions. it proceeds therefore from the [[passions]]; which are
different, not onely from the difference of mens [[men]] complexions; but also
from their difference of customes, and [[education]].

the [[passions]] that most of all cause the differences of wit, are
principally, the more or lesse [[desire]] of [[power]], of riches [[rich]], of [[knowledge]],
and of [[honour]]. all which may be reduced to the first, that is [[desire]] of
power. for riches [[rich]], [[knowledge]] and [[honour]] are but severall sorts of [[power]].




giddinesse madnesse

and therefore, a [[man]] who has no [[great]] passion for any of these things;
but is as [[men]] terme it indifferent; though he may be so farre a good
man, as to be [[free]] from giving offence; yet he cannot possibly have
either a [[great]] fancy, or much judgement. for the thoughts [[thought]], are to the
desires, as scouts, and spies, to range abroad, and find the way to the
things [[desired]]: all stedinesse of the minds [[mind]] motion, and all quicknesse
of the same, proceeding from thence. for as to have no [[desire]], is to
be [[dead]]: so to have [[weak]] [[passions]], is dulnesse; and to have passions
indifferently for every thing, giddinesse, and distraction; and to have
stronger, and more vehement [[passions]] for any thing, than is ordinarily
seen in others, is that which [[men]] call madnesse.

whereof there be almost as many kinds [[kind]], as of the [[passions]] themselves.
sometimes the extraordinary and extravagant passion, proceedeth from the
evill [[constitution]] of the organs of the [[body]], or harme done them; and
sometimes the hurt, and indisposition of the organs, is caused by the
vehemence, or long continuance of the passion. but in both cases the
madnesse is of one and the same [[nature]].

the passion, whose [[violence]], or continuance maketh madnesse, is either
great vaine-glory; which is commonly called [[pride]], and selfe-conceipt;
or [[great]] dejection of [[mind]].




rage

pride, subjecteth a [[man]] to anger, the excesse whereof, is the madnesse
called rage, and fury. and thus it comes to passe that excessive desire
of [[revenge]], when it becomes habituall, hurteth the organs, and becomes
rage: that excessive [[love]], with jealousie, becomes also rage: excessive
opinion of a mans [[man]] own selfe, for [[divine]] inspiration, for wisdome,
learning, forme, and the like, becomes distraction, and giddinesse:
the same, joyned with envy, rage: vehement [[opinion]] of the [[truth]] of any
thing, contradicted by others, rage.




melancholy

dejection, subjects [[subject]] a [[man]] to causelesse fears [[fear]]; which is a madnesse
commonly called melancholy, apparent also in divers manners; as in
haunting of solitudes, and graves; in [[superstitious]] behaviour; and in
fearing some one, some another particular thing. in summe, all passions
that [[produce]] [[strange]] and unusuall behaviour, are called by the generall
name of madnesse. but of the severall kinds [[kind]] of madnesse, he that
would take the paines, might enrowle a legion. and if the excesses be
madnesse, there is no [[doubt]] but the [[passions]] themselves, when they tend
to evill, are degrees [[degree]] of the same.

(for [[example]],) though the effect of folly, in them that are possessed of
an [[opinion]] of being inspired, be not visible alwayes in one [[man]], by any
very extravagant action, that proceedeth from such passion; yet when
many of them conspire together, the rage of the whole multitude is
visible enough. for what argument of madnesse can there be greater, than
to clamour, strike, and throw stones at our [[best]] [[friends]]? yet this is
somewhat lesse than such a multitude will do. for they will clamour,
fight against, and [[destroy]] those, by whom all their lifetime before,
they have been protected, and secured from injury. and if this be
madnesse in the multitude, it is the same in every particular [[man]]. for
as in the middest of the sea, though a [[man]] perceive no sound of
that part of the water next him; yet he is well assured, that part
contributes as much, to the roaring of the sea, as any other part, of
the same quantity: so also, [[thought]] wee perceive no [[great]] unquietnesse,
in one, or two [[men]]; yet we may be well assured, that their singular
passions, are parts of the seditious roaring of a troubled nation. and
if there were nothing else that bewrayed their madnesse; yet that very
arrogating such inspiration to themselves, is argument enough. if some
man in bedlam should entertaine you with sober discourse; and you desire
in taking leave, to [[know]] what he were, that you might another time
requite his civility; and he should tell you, he were [[god]] the [[father]];
i [[think]] you need expect no extravagant action for argument of his
madnesse.

this [[opinion]] of inspiration, called commonly, private spirit, begins
very often, from some lucky finding of an errour generally held by
others; and not knowing, or not remembring, by what conduct of [[reason]],
they came to so singular a [[truth]], (as they [[think]] it, though it be many
times an untruth they [[light]] on,) they presently [[admire]] themselves; as
being in the speciall grace of [[god]] almighty, who hath revealed the same
to them supernaturally, by his spirit.

again, that madnesse is nothing else, but too much appearing passion,
may be gathered out of the effects of wine, which are the same with
those of the evill disposition of the organs. for the variety of
behaviour in [[men]] that have drunk too much, is the same with that of
mad-men: some of them raging, others loving, others laughing, all
extravagantly, but according to their severall domineering [[passions]]:
for the effect of the wine, does but remove dissimulation; and take from
them the sight of the deformity of their [[passions]]. for, (i believe) the
most sober [[men]], when they walk alone without [[care]] and employment of the
mind, would be unwilling the vanity and extravagance of their thoughts
at that [[time]] should be publiquely seen: which is a [[confession]], that
passions unguided, are for the most part meere madnesse.

the opinions [[opinion]] of the [[world]], both in antient and later ages [[age]], concerning
the cause of madnesse, have been two. some, deriving them from the
passions; some, from daemons, or spirits, either [[good]], or [[bad]], which
they [[thought]] might enter into a [[man]], possesse him, and move his organs
is such [[strange]], and uncouth manner, as mad-men use to do. the former
sort therefore, called such [[men]], mad-men: but the later, called them
sometimes daemoniacks, (that is, possessed with spirits;) sometimes
energumeni, (that is agitated, or moved with spirits;) and now in
italy they are called not onely pazzi, mad-men; but also spiritati, men
possest.

there was once a [[great]] conflux of [[people]] in abdera, a [[city]] of the
greeks, at the acting of the tragedy of andromeda, upon an extream hot
day: whereupon, a [[great]] many of the spectators falling into fevers, had
this accident from the heat, and from the tragedy together, that they
did nothing but pronounce iambiques, with the names of perseus and
andromeda; which together with the fever, was cured, by the comming on
of winter: and this madnesse was [[thought]] to proceed from the passion
imprinted by the tragedy. likewise there raigned a fit of madnesse in
another graecian [[city]], which seized onely the [[young]] maidens; and caused
many of them to hang themselves. this was by most then [[thought]] an act of
the divel. but one that suspected, that contempt of [[life]] in them,
might proceed from some passion of the [[mind]], and supposing they did not
contemne also their [[honour]], gave counsell to the magistrates, to strip
such as so hang’d themselves, and let them hang out naked. this the
story sayes cured that madnesse. but on the other side, the same
graecians, did often ascribe madnesse, to the operation of the
eumenides, or furyes; and sometimes of ceres, phoebus, and other gods:
so much did [[men]] attribute to phantasmes, as to [[think]] them aereal living
bodies; and generally to call them spirits. and as the romans in this,
held the same [[opinion]] with the greeks [[greek]]: so also did the jewes; for they
calle mad-men prophets [[prophet]], or (according as they [[thought]] the spirits
good or bad) daemoniacks; and some of them called both prophets [[prophet]], and
daemoniacks, mad-men; and some called the same [[man]] both daemoniack, and
mad-man. but for the gentiles, ’tis no wonder; because diseases, and
health; vices [[vice]], and vertues; and many naturall accidents, were with them
termed, and worshipped as daemons. so that a [[man]] was to [[understand]] by
daemon, as well (sometimes) an ague, as a divell. but for the jewes to
have such [[opinion]], is somewhat [[strange]]. for neither [[moses]], nor abraham
pretended to prophecy by possession of a spirit; but from the voyce of
god; or by a vision or [[dream]]: nor is there any thing in his [[law]],
morall, or ceremoniall, by which they were taught, there was any such
enthusiasme; or any possession. when [[god]] is sayd, (numb. 11. 25.) to
take from the spirit that was in [[moses]], and give it to the 70. elders,
the spirit of [[god]] (taking it for the substance of god) is not divided.
the scriptures [[scripture]] by the spirit of [[god]] in [[man]], mean a mans [[man]] spirit, enclined
to godlinesse. and where it is said (exod. 28. 3.) "whom i have filled
with the spirit of wisdome to make garments for aaron," is not meant a
spirit put into them, that can make garments; but the wisdome of their
own spirits in that [[kind]] of [[work]]. in the like sense, the spirit of
man, when it produceth unclean actions, is ordinarily called an unclean
spirit; and so other spirits, though not alwayes, yet as often as the
vertue or [[vice]] so stiled, is extraordinary, and eminent. neither did the
other prophets [[prophet]] of the old testament pretend enthusiasme; or, that god
spake in them; but to them by voyce, vision, or [[dream]]; and the burthen
of the [[lord]] was not possession, but command. how then could the jewes
fall into this [[opinion]] of possession? i can imagine no [[reason]], but that
which is [[common]] to all [[men]]; namely, the want of curiosity to search
naturall causes; and their placing felicity, in the acquisition of the
grosse pleasures [[pleasure]] of the senses, and the things that most immediately
conduce thereto. for they that see any [[strange]], and unusuall ability, or
defect in a mans [[man]] [[mind]]; unlesse they see withall, from what cause it may
probably proceed, can hardly [[think]] it naturall; and if not naturall,
they must needs thinke it supernaturall; and then what can it be, but
that either [[god]], or the divell is in him? and hence it came to passe,
when our saviour (mark 3.21.) was compassed about with the multitude,
those of the house doubted he was mad, and went out to hold him: but
the scribes said he had belzebub, and that was it, by which he cast out
divels; as if the greater mad-man had awed the lesser. and that (john
10. 20.) some said, "he hath a divell, and is mad;" whereas others
holding him for a [[prophet]], sayd, "these are not the words of one that
hath a divell." so in the old testament he that came to anoynt jehu, (2
kings 9.11.) was a [[prophet]]; but some of the company [[asked]] jehu, "what
came that mad-man for?" so that in summe, it is manifest, that whosoever
behaved himselfe in extraordinary manner, was [[thought]] by the jewes to be
possessed either with a [[good]], or evill spirit; except by the sadduces,
who erred so farre on the other hand, as not to [[believe]] there were at
all any spirits, (which is very neere to direct atheisme;) and thereby
perhaps the more provoked others, to terme such [[men]] daemoniacks, rather
than mad-men.

but why then does our saviour proceed in the curing of them, as if they
were possest; and not as if they were mad. to which i can give no other
kind of [[answer]], but that which is given to those that urge the scripture
in like manner against the [[opinion]] of the motion of the [[earth]]. the
scripture was written to shew unto [[men]] the kingdome of [[god]]; and to
prepare their mindes to become his [[obedient]] subjects [[subject]]; leaving the
world, and the [[philosophy]] thereof, to the disputation of [[men]], for the
exercising of their naturall [[reason]]. whether the earths, or suns motion
make the day, and night; or whether the exorbitant actions of [[men]],
proceed from passion, or from the divell, (so we [[worship]] him not) it is
all one, as to our [[obedience]], and subjection to [[god]] almighty; which is
the thing for which the [[scripture]] was written. as for that our saviour
speaketh to the disease, as to a [[person]]; it is the usuall phrase of all
that cure by words onely, as [[christ]] did, (and inchanters pretend to
do, whether they speak to a divel or not.) for is not [[christ]] also said
(math. 8.26.) to have rebuked the winds? is not he said also (luk. 4.
39.) to rebuke a fever? yet this does not argue that a fever is a divel.
and whereas many of these divels are said to confesse [[christ]]; it is not
necessary to interpret those places otherwise, than that those mad-men
confessed him. and whereas our saviour (math. 12. 43.) speaketh of an
unclean spirit, that having gone out of a [[man]], wandreth through dry
places, seeking rest, and finding none; and returning into the same
man, with seven other spirits worse than himselfe; it is manifestly a
parable, alluding to a [[man]], that after a little endeavour to quit his
lusts, is vanquished by the [[strength]] of them; and becomes seven times
worse than he was. so that i see nothing at all in the [[scripture]], that
requireth a beliefe, that daemoniacks were any other thing but mad-men.




insignificant speech

there is yet another [[fault]] in the discourses of some [[men]]; which may also
be numbred amongst the sorts of madnesse; namely, that [[abuse]] of words,
whereof i have spoken before in the fifth [[chapter]], by the name of
absurdity. and that is, when [[men]] speak such words, as put together, have
in them no signification at all; but are fallen upon by some, through
misunderstanding of the words they have received, and repeat by rote; by
others, from intention to [[deceive]] by obscurity. and this is incident to
none but those, that converse in questions [[question]] of matters incomprehensible,
as the schoole-men; or in questions [[question]] of abstruse [[philosophy]]. the common
sort of [[men]] seldome speak insignificantly, and are therefore, by those
other egregious persons [[person]] counted idiots. but to be assured their words
are without any thing correspondent to them in the [[mind]], there would
need some examples [[example]]; which if any [[man]] require, let him take a schoole-man
into his hands, and see if he can translate any one [[chapter]] concerning
any difficult point; as the trinity; the deity; the [[nature]] of [[christ]];
transubstantiation; free-will. &c. into any of the moderne tongues, so
as to make the same intelligible; or into any tolerable latine, such
as they were acquainted withall, that lived when the latine tongue was
vulgar. what is the meaning of these words. "the first cause does not
necessarily inflow any thing into the second, by [[force]] of the essential
subordination of the second causes, by which it may [[help]] it to worke?"
they are the translation of the title of the sixth [[chapter]] of suarez
first booke, of the concourse, motion, and [[help]] of [[god]]. when [[men]] write
whole volumes of such stuffe, are they not mad, or intend to make others
so? and particularly, in the [[question]] of transubstantiation; where
after [[certain]] words spoken, they that say, the white-nesse, round-nesse,
magni-tude, quali-ty, corruptibili-ty, all which are incorporeall, &c.
go out of the wafer, into the [[body]] of our blessed saviour, do they not
make those nesses, tudes and ties, to be so many spirits possessing his
body? for by spirits, they mean alwayes things, that being incorporeall,
are neverthelesse moveable from one place to another. so that this kind
of absurdity, may rightly be numbred amongst the many sorts of madnesse;
and all the [[time]] that guided by clear thoughts [[thought]] of their worldly [[lust]],
they forbear disputing, or writing thus, but lucide intervals. and thus
much of the vertues and defects intellectuall.



chapter ix. of the severall subjects [[subject]] of knowledge


there are of [[knowledge]] two kinds [[kind]]; whereof one is [[knowledge]] of [[fact]]: the
other [[knowledge]] of the consequence of one affirmation to another. the
former is nothing else, but sense and memory, and is absolute [[knowledge]];
as when we see a [[fact]] doing, or [[remember]] it done: and this is the
knowledge required in a witnesse. the later is called [[science]]; and is
conditionall; as when we [[know]], that, if the figure showne be a circle,
then any straight line through the centre shall divide it into two
equall parts. and this is the [[knowledge]] required in a philosopher; that
is to say, of him that pretends to reasoning.

the register of [[knowledge]] of [[fact]] is called [[history]]. whereof there be
two sorts: one called naturall [[history]]; which is the [[history]] of such
facts, or effects of [[nature]], as have no dependance on mans [[man]] will; such as
are the histories [[history]] of metals, plants, animals, regions, and the like. the
other, is civill [[history]]; which is the [[history]] of the voluntary actions
of [[men]] in common-wealths.

the registers of [[science]], are such books [[book]] as contain the demonstrations
of consequences of one affirmation, to another; and are commonly called
books of [[philosophy]]; whereof the sorts are many, according to the
diversity of the matter; and may be divided in such manner as i have
divided them in the following table.

chapter x. of [[power]], worth, [[dignity]], [[honour]] and worthiness




power

the [[power]] of a [[man]], (to take it universally,) is his [[present]] means,
to obtain some future apparent [[good]]. and is either originall, or
instrumentall.

naturall [[power]], is the eminence of the faculties of [[body]], or [[mind]]: as
extraordinary [[strength]], forme, prudence, [[arts]], eloquence, liberality,
nobility. instrumentall are those powers [[power]], which acquired by these, or
by [[fortune]], are means and instruments to acquire more: as riches [[rich]],
reputation, [[friends]], and the secret working of [[god]], which [[men]] call
good [[luck]]. for the [[nature]] of [[power]], is in this point, like to fame,
increasing as it proceeds; or like the motion of heavy bodies [[body]], which the
further they go, make still the more hast.

the [[greatest]] of humane powers [[power]], is that which is compounded of the powers
of most [[men]], [[united]] by [[consent]], in one [[person]], naturall, or civill, that
has the use of all their powers [[power]] depending on his will; such as is the
power of a common-wealth: or depending on the wills of each particular;
such as is the [[power]] of a faction, or of divers factions leagued.
therefore to have servants, is [[power]]; to have [[friends]], is [[power]]: for
they are strengths [[united]].

also riches [[rich]] joyned with liberality, is [[power]]; because it procureth
friends, and servants: without liberality, not so; because in this case
they defend not; but expose [[men]] to envy, as a prey.

reputation of [[power]], is [[power]]; because it draweth with it the adhaerance
of those that need protection.

so is [[reputation]] of [[love]] of a mans [[man]] [[country]], (called popularity,) for the
same [[reason]].

also, what quality soever maketh a [[man]] beloved, or feared of many; or
the [[reputation]] of such quality, is [[power]]; because it is a means to have
the assistance, and service of many.

good successe is [[power]]; because it maketh [[reputation]] of wisdome, or good
fortune; which makes [[men]] either feare him, or rely on him.

affability of [[men]] already in [[power]], is encrease of [[power]]; because it
gaineth [[love]].

reputation of prudence in the conduct of [[peace]] or [[war]], is [[power]]; because
to prudent [[men]], we commit the [[government]] of our selves, more willingly
than to others.

nobility is [[power]], not in all places, but onely in those common-wealths,
where it has priviledges: for in such priviledges consisteth their
power.

eloquence is [[power]]; because it is seeming prudence.

forme is [[power]]; because being a promise of [[good]], it recommendeth [[men]] to
the favour of [[women]] and strangers.

the sciences [[science]], are small [[power]]; because not eminent; and therefore, not
acknowledged in any [[man]]; nor are at all, but in a few; and in them, but
of a few things. for [[science]] is of that [[nature]], as none can understand
it to be, but such as in a [[good]] measure have attayned it.

arts of publique use, as fortification, making of engines, and other
instruments of [[war]]; because they conferre to defence, and [[victory]],
are [[power]]; and though the true [[mother]] of them, be [[science]], namely the
mathematiques; yet, because they are brought into the [[light]], by the hand
of the artificer, they be esteemed (the midwife passing with the vulgar
for the [[mother]],) as his issue.




worth

the value, or worth of a [[man]], is as of all other things, his price;
that is to say, so much as would be given for the use of his [[power]]:
and therefore is not absolute; but a thing dependant on the need and
judgement of another. an able conductor of souldiers, is of [[great]] price
in [[time]] of [[war]] [[present]], or imminent; but in [[peace]] not so. a learned and
uncorrupt [[judge]], is much worth in [[time]] of [[peace]]; but not so much in
war. and as in other things, so in [[men]], not the seller, but the buyer
determines the price. for let a [[man]] (as most [[men]] do,) rate themselves as
the highest value they can; yet their true value is no more than it is
esteemed by others.

the manifestation of the value we set on one another, is that which is
commonly called honouring, and dishonouring. to value a [[man]] at a high
rate, is to [[honour]] him; at a low rate, is to dishonour him. but high,
and low, in this case, is to be understood by comparison to the rate
that each [[man]] setteth on himselfe.




dignity

the publique worth of a [[man]], which is the value set on him by the
common-wealth, is that which [[men]] commonly call [[dignity]]. and this value
of him by the common-wealth, is understood, by offices of command,
judicature, publike employment; or by names and titles, introduced for
distinction of such value.




to [[honour]] and dishonour

to [[pray]] to another, for ayde of any [[kind]], is to [[honour]]; because a signe
we have an [[opinion]] he has [[power]] to [[help]]; and the more difficult the ayde
is, the more is the [[honour]].

to obey, is to [[honour]]; because no [[man]] obeyes them, whom they think
have no [[power]] to [[help]], or hurt them. and consequently to disobey, is to
dishonour.

to give [[great]] gifts to a [[man]], is to [[honour]] him; because ’tis buying
of protection, and acknowledging of [[power]]. to give little gifts, is to
dishonour; because it is but almes, and signifies an [[opinion]] of the
need of small helps. to be sedulous in promoting anothers [[good]]; also
to flatter, is to [[honour]]; as a signe we seek his protection or ayde. to
neglect, is to dishonour.

to give way, or place to another, in any commodity, is to [[honour]]; being
a [[confession]] of greater [[power]]. to arrogate, is to dishonour.

to shew any signe of [[love]], or feare of another, is to [[honour]]; for both
to [[love]], and to feare, is to value. to contemne, or lesse to [[love]] or
feare then he expects, is to dishonour; for ’tis undervaluing.

to [[praise]], magnifie, or call [[happy]], is to [[honour]]; because nothing but
goodnesse, [[power]], and felicity is valued. to revile, mock, or pitty, is
to dishonour.

to speak to another with consideration, to appear before him with
decency, and [[humility]], is to [[honour]] him; as signes of [[fear]] to offend.
to speak to him rashly, to do anything before him obscenely, slovenly,
impudently, is to dishonour.

to [[believe]], to trust, to rely on another, is to [[honour]] him; signe of
opinion of his vertue and [[power]]. to distrust, or not [[believe]], is to
dishonour.

to hearken to a mans [[man]] counsell, or discourse of what [[kind]] soever, is to
honour; as a signe we [[think]] him [[wise]], or eloquent, or witty. to sleep,
or go forth, or talk the while, is to dishonour.

to do those things to another, which he takes for signes of [[honour]], or
which the [[law]] or custome makes so, is to [[honour]]; because in approving
the [[honour]] done by others, he acknowledgeth the [[power]] which others
acknowledge. to refuse to do them, is to dishonour.

to agree with in [[opinion]], is to [[honour]]; as being a signe of approving
his judgement, and wisdome. to dissent, is dishonour; and an upbraiding
of errour; and (if the dissent be in many things) of folly.

to imitate, is to [[honour]]; for it is vehemently to approve. to imitate
ones [[enemy]], is to dishonour.

to [[honour]] those another honours [[honour]], is to [[honour]] him; as a signe of
approbation of his judgement. to [[honour]] his enemies [[enemy]], is to dishonour
him.

to employ in counsell, or in actions of difficulty, is to [[honour]]; as a
signe of [[opinion]] of his wisdome, or other [[power]]. to deny employment in
the same cases, to those that seek it, is to dishonour.

all these wayes of honouring, are naturall; and as well within, as
without common-wealths. but in common-wealths, where he, or they that
have the supreme [[authority]], can make whatsoever they please, to stand
for signes of [[honour]], there be other honours [[honour]].

a soveraigne doth [[honour]] a [[subject]], with whatsoever title, or office, or
employment, or action, that he himselfe will have taken for a signe of
his will to [[honour]] him.

the [[king]] of [[persia]], honoured mordecay, when he appointed he should be
conducted through the streets in the kings [[king]] garment, upon one of the
kings horses, with a [[crown]] on his head, and a [[prince]] before him,
proclayming, "thus shall it be done to him that the [[king]] will [[honour]]."
and yet another [[king]] of [[persia]], or the same another [[time]], to one that
demanded for some [[great]] service, to weare one of the kings [[king]] robes, gave
him leave so to do; but with his addition, that he should weare it as
the kings [[king]] foole; and then it was dishonour. so that of civill [[honour]];
such as are magistracy, offices, titles; and in some places coats, and
scutchions painted: and [[men]] [[honour]] such as have them, as having so many
signes of favour in the common-wealth; which favour is [[power]].

honourable is whatsoever possession, action, or quality, is an argument
and signe of [[power]].

and therefore to be honoured, loved, or feared of many, is honourable;
as arguments of [[power]]. to be honoured of few or none, dishonourable.

good [[fortune]] (if lasting,) honourable; as a signe of the favour of [[god]].
ill [[fortune]], and losses, dishonourable. riches [[rich]], are honourable; for
they are [[power]]. [[poverty]], dishonourable. magnanimity, liberality,
hope, [[courage]], confidence, are honourable; for they proceed from the
conscience of [[power]]. pusillanimity, parsimony, [[fear]], diffidence, are
dishonourable.

timely resolution, or determination of what a [[man]] is to do, is
honourable; as being the contempt of small difficulties, and dangers.
and irresolution, dishonourable; as a signe of too much valuing of
little impediments, and little advantages: for when a [[man]] has weighed
things as long as the [[time]] permits, and resolves not, the difference
of weight is but little; and therefore if he resolve not, he overvalues
little things, which is pusillanimity.

all actions, and speeches [[speech]], that proceed, or seem to proceed from much
experience, [[science]], discretion, or wit, are honourable; for all these
are powers [[power]]. actions, or words that proceed from errour, ignorance, or
folly, dishonourable.

gravity, as farre forth as it seems to proceed from a [[mind]] employed on
some thing else, is honourable; because employment is a signe of
power. but if it seem to proceed from a [[purpose]] to appear grave, it is
dishonourable. for the gravity of the former, is like the steddinesse of
a ship laden with merchandise; but of the later, like the steddinesse of
a ship ballasted with sand, and other trash.

to be conspicuous, that is to say, to be known, for [[wealth]], office,
great actions, or any eminent [[good]], is honourable; as a signe of the
power for which he is conspicuous. on the contrary, obscurity, is
dishonourable.

to be descended from conspicuous parents, is honourable; because they
the more easily attain the aydes, and [[friends]] of their [[ancestors]]. on the
contrary, to be descended from obscure parentage, is dishonourable.

actions proceeding from equity, joyned with losse, are honourable;
as signes of magnanimity: for magnanimity is a signe of [[power]]. on the
contrary, craft, shifting, neglect of equity, is dishonourable.

nor does it alter the case of [[honour]], whether an action (so it be great
and difficult, and consequently a signe of much [[power]],) be just or
unjust: for [[honour]] consisteth onely in the [[opinion]] of [[power]]. therefore
the ancient heathen did not thinke they dishonoured, but greatly
honoured the gods, when they introduced them in their poems, committing
rapes, thefts, and other [[great]], but [[unjust]], or unclean acts: in so much
as nothing is so much celebrated in [[jupiter]], as his adulteries; nor
in mercury, as his frauds, and thefts: of whose praises [[praise]], in a hymne
of [[homer]], the [[greatest]] is this, that being born in the morning, he had
invented musique at noon, and before night, stolen away the cattell of
appollo, from his herdsmen.

also amongst [[men]], till there were constituted [[great]] common-wealths,
it was [[thought]] no dishonour to be a pyrate, or a high-way theefe; but
rather a lawfull [[trade]], not onely amongst the greeks [[greek]], but also amongst
all other nations; as is manifest by the histories [[history]] of antient [[time]]. and
at this day, in this part of the [[world]], private duels are, and alwayes
will be honourable, though unlawfull, till such [[time]] as there shall be
honour ordained for them that refuse, and ignominy for them that make
the challenge. for duels also are many times [[time]] effects of [[courage]]; and the
ground of [[courage]] is alwayes [[strength]] or [[skill]], which are [[power]]; though
for the most part they be effects of rash speaking, and of the [[fear]] of
dishonour, in one, or both the combatants; who engaged by rashnesse, are
driven into the lists to avoyd disgrace.

scutchions, and coats of armes haereditary, where they have any eminent
priviledges, are honourable; otherwise not: for their [[power]] consisteth
either in such priviledges, or in riches [[rich]], or some such thing as is
equally honoured in other [[men]]. this [[kind]] of [[honour]], commonly called
gentry, has been derived from the antient germans. for there never was
any such thing known, where the [[german]] customes were unknown. nor is it
now any where in use, where the germans have not inhabited. the antient
greek commanders, when they went to [[war]], had their shields painted with
such devises as they pleased; insomuch as an unpainted buckler was a
signe of [[poverty]], and of a [[common]] souldier: but they transmitted not the
inheritance of them. the romans transmitted the marks of their families [[family]]:
but they were the images, not the devises of their [[ancestors]]. amongst
the [[people]] of [[asia]], afrique, and [[america]], there is not, nor was ever,
any such thing. the germans onely had that custome; from whom it has
been derived into [[england]], [[france]], [[spain]], and [[italy]], when in great
numbers they either ayded the romans, or made their own conquests in
these westerne parts of the [[world]].

for germany, being antiently, as all other countries [[country]], in their
beginnings, divided amongst an infinite number of little lords [[lord]], or
masters of families [[family]], that continually had wars [[war]] one with another; those
masters, or lords [[lord]], principally to the end they might, when they were
covered with arms, be known by their followers; and partly for ornament,
both painted their armor, or their scutchion, or coat, with the picture
of some beast, or other thing; and also put some eminent and visible
mark upon the crest of their helmets. and his ornament both of the
armes, and crest, descended by [[inheritance]] to their [[children]]; to the
eldest pure, and to the rest with some note of [[diversity]], such as the
old master, that is to say in dutch, the here-alt [[thought]] fit. but when
many such families [[family]], joyned together, made a greater [[monarchy]], this duty
of the herealt, to distinguish scutchions, was made a private office
a part. and the issue of these lords [[lord]], is the [[great]] and antient gentry;
which for the most part bear living creatures, noted for [[courage]], and
rapine; or castles, battlements, belts, [[weapons]], bars, palisadoes, and
other notes of [[war]]; nothing being then in [[honour]], but vertue [[military]].
afterwards, not onely kings [[king]], but popular common-wealths, gave divers
manners of scutchions, to such as went forth to the [[war]], or returned
from it, for encouragement, or recompence to their service. all which,
by an observing reader, may be found in such ancient histories [[history]], greek
and latine, as make mention of the [[german]] nation, and manners, in their
times.




titles of honour

titles of [[honour]], such as are duke, count, marquis, and baron, are
honourable; as signifying the value set upon them by the soveraigne
power of the common-wealth: which titles, were in old [[time]] titles
of office, and command, derived some from the romans, some from the
germans, and french. dukes, in latine duces, being generalls in [[war]]:
counts, comites, such as bare the generall company out of [[friendship]];
and were left to govern and defend places conquered, and pacified:
marquises, marchiones, were counts that governed the marches, or bounds
of the [[empire]]. which titles of duke, count, and marquis, came into the
empire, about the [[time]] of constantine the [[great]], from the customes of
the [[german]] militia. but baron, seems to have been a title of the gaules,
and signifies a [[great]] [[man]]; such as were the kings [[king]], or princes [[prince]] [[men]], whom
they employed in [[war]] about their persons [[person]]; and seems to be derived from
vir, to ber, and bar, that signified the same in the [[language]] of the
gaules, that vir in latine; and thence to bero, and baro: so that such
men were called berones, and after barones; and (in spanish) varones.
but he that would [[know]] more particularly the originall of titles of
honour, may find it, as i have done this, in mr. seldens most excellent
treatise of that [[subject]]. in processe of [[time]] these offices of [[honour]],
by [[occasion]] of trouble, and for reasons [[reason]] of [[good]] and peacable [[government]],
were turned into meer titles; serving for the most part, to distinguish
the precedence, place, and order of subjects [[subject]] in the common-wealth: and
men were made dukes, counts, marquises, and barons of places, wherein
they had neither possession, nor command: and other titles also, were
devised to the same end.




worthinesse fitnesse

worthinesse, is a thing different from the worth, or value of a [[man]]; and
also from his [[merit]], or desert; and consisteth in a particular [[power]],
or ability for that, whereof he is said to be worthy: which particular
ability, is usually named fitnesse, or aptitude.

for he is worthiest to be a commander, to be a [[judge]], or to have any
other charge, that is [[best]] fitted, with the qualities required to the
well discharging of it; and worthiest of riches [[rich]], that has the qualities
most requisite for the well using of them: any of which qualities being
absent, one may neverthelesse be a worthy [[man]], and valuable for
some thing else. again, a [[man]] may be worthy of riches [[rich]], office, and
employment, that neverthelesse, can plead no [[right]] to have it before
another; and therefore cannot be said to [[merit]] or deserve it. for [[merit]],
praesupposeth a [[right]], and that the thing deserved is due by promise: of
which i shall say more hereafter, when i shall speak of contracts.




chapter xi. of the difference of manners




what is here meant by manners

by manners, i mean not here, decency of behaviour; as how one [[man]] should
salute another, or how a [[man]] should wash his mouth, or pick his teeth
before company, and such other points of the small morals [[moral]]; but those
qualities of man-kind, that concern their living together in [[peace]], and
unity. to which end we are to consider, that the felicity of this [[life]],
consisteth not in the repose of a [[mind]] satisfied. for there is no such
finis ultimus, (utmost ayme,) nor summum bonum, (greatest [[good]],) as is
spoken of in the books [[book]] of the old morall [[philosophers]]. nor can a man
any more [[live]], whose desires [[desire]] are at an end, than he, whose senses and
imaginations are at a stand. felicity is a continuall progresse of the
desire, from one object to another; the attaining of the former, being
still but the way to the later. the cause whereof is, that the object
of mans [[man]] [[desire]], is not to enjoy once onely, and for one instant of [[time]];
but to assure for ever, the way of his future [[desire]]. and therefore the
voluntary actions, and inclinations of all [[men]], tend, not only to the
procuring, but also to the assuring of a contented [[life]]; and differ
onely in the way: which ariseth partly from the [[diversity]] of [[passions]],
in divers [[men]]; and partly from the difference of the [[knowledge]], or
opinion each one has of the causes, which [[produce]] the effect [[desired]].




a restlesse [[desire]] of [[power]], in all men

so that in the first place, i put for a generall inclination of all
mankind, a perpetuall and restlesse [[desire]] of [[power]] after [[power]], that
ceaseth onely in [[death]]. and the cause of this, is not alwayes that a man
hopes for a more intensive delight, than he has already attained to; or
that he cannot be content with a moderate [[power]]: but because he cannot
assure the [[power]] and means to [[live]] well, which he hath [[present]], without
the acquisition of more. and from hence it is, that kings [[king]], whose power
is [[greatest]], turn their endeavours to the assuring it a [[home]] by lawes,
or abroad by wars [[war]]: and when that is done, there succeedeth a new [[desire]];
in some, of fame from new [[conquest]]; in others, of ease and sensuall
pleasure; in others, of admiration, or being flattered for excellence in
some art [[arts]], or other ability of the [[mind]].




love of contention from competition

competition of riches [[rich]], [[honour]], command, or other [[power]], enclineth to
contention, enmity, and [[war]]: because the way of one competitor, to the
attaining of his [[desire]], is to kill, subdue, supplant, or repell the
other. particularly, competition of [[praise]], enclineth to a reverence of
antiquity. for [[men]] contend with the living, not with the [[dead]]; to these
ascribing more than due, that they may obscure the [[glory]] of the other.




civil [[obedience]] from [[love]] of ease

desire of ease, and sensuall delight, disposeth [[men]] to obey a common
power: because by such desires [[desire]], a [[man]] doth abandon the protection might
be hoped for from his own industry, and [[labour]].




from feare of [[death]] or wounds

fear of [[death]], and wounds, disposeth to the same; and for the same
reason. on the contrary, needy [[men]], and hardy, not contented with their
present condition; as also, all [[men]] that are ambitious of military
command, are enclined to continue the causes of warre; and to stirre up
trouble and sedition: for there is no [[honour]] [[military]] but by warre; nor
any such [[hope]] to mend an ill game, as by causing a new shuffle.




and from [[love]] of arts

desire of [[knowledge]], and [[arts]] of [[peace]], enclineth [[men]] to obey a common
power: for such [[desire]], containeth a [[desire]] of leasure; and consequently
protection from some other [[power]] than their own.




love of vertue, from [[love]] of praise

desire of [[praise]], disposeth to laudable actions, such as please them
whose judgement they value; for of these [[men]] whom we contemn, we contemn
also the praises [[praise]]. [[desire]] of fame after [[death]] does the same. and though
after [[death]], there be no sense of the [[praise]] given us on [[earth]], as being
joyes, that are either swallowed up in the unspeakable joyes of [[heaven]],
or extinguished in the extreme torments of hell: yet is not such fame
vain; because [[men]] have a [[present]] delight therein, from the foresight
of it, and of the benefit that may rebound thereby to their [[posterity]]:
which though they now see not, yet they imagine; and any thing that is
pleasure in the sense, the same also is [[pleasure]] in the [[imagination]].




hate, from difficulty of requiting [[great]] benefits

to have received from one, to whom we [[think]] our selves equall, greater
benefits than there is [[hope]] to requite, disposeth to counterfiet [[love]];
but really secret [[hatred]]; and puts a [[man]] into the estate of a desperate
debtor, that in declining the sight of his creditor, tacitely wishes
him there, where he might never see him more. for benefits oblige; and
obligation is thraldome; which is to ones equall, hateful. but to have
received benefits from one, whom we acknowledge our superiour, enclines
to [[love]]; because the obligation is no new depession: and cheerfull
acceptation, (which [[men]] call gratitude,) is such an [[honour]] done to
the obliger, as is taken generally for retribution. also to receive
benefits, though from an equall, or inferiour, as long as there is hope
of requitall, disposeth to [[love]]: for in the intention of the receiver,
the obligation is of ayd, and service mutuall; from whence proceedeth
an emulation of who shall exceed in benefiting; the most [[noble]] and
profitable contention possible; wherein the victor is pleased with his
victory, and the other revenged by confessing it.




and from [[conscience]] of deserving to be hated

to have done more hurt to a [[man]], than he can, or is willing to expiate,
enclineth the doer to hate the sufferer. for he must expect [[revenge]], or
forgivenesse; both which are hatefull.




promptnesse to hurt, from fear

feare of oppression, disposeth a [[man]] to anticipate, or to seek ayd by
society: for there is no other way by which a [[man]] can secure his life
and [[liberty]].




and from distrust of their own wit

men that distrust their own subtilty, are in tumult, and sedition,
better disposed for [[victory]], than they that suppose themselves [[wise]],
or crafty. for these [[love]] to consult, the other (fearing to be
circumvented,) to strike first. and in sedition, [[men]] being alwayes in
the procincts of battell, to hold together, and use all advantages of
force, is a [[better]] stratagem, than any that can proceed from subtilty of
wit.




vain undertaking from vain-glory

vain-glorious [[men]], such as without being conscious to themselves of
great sufficiency, delight in supposing themselves gallant [[men]], are
enclined onely to ostentation; but not to attempt: because when
danger or difficulty appears, they look for nothing but to have their
insufficiency discovered.

vain-glorious [[men]], such as estimate their sufficiency by the flattery
of other [[men]], or the [[fortune]] of some precedent action, without assured
ground of [[hope]] from the true [[knowledge]] of themselves, are enclined to
rash engaging; and in the approach of danger, or difficulty, to retire
if they can: because not seeing the way of safety, they will rather
hazard their [[honour]], which may be salved with an excuse; than their
lives, for which no salve is sufficient.




ambition, from [[opinion]] of sufficiency

men that have a [[strong]] [[opinion]] of their own wisdome in matter of
government, are disposed to [[ambition]]. because without publique
employment in counsell or magistracy, the [[honour]] of their wisdome is
lost. and therefore eloquent speakers are enclined to [[ambition]]; for
eloquence seemeth wisdome, both to themselves and others




irresolution, from too [[great]] valuing of small matters

pusillanimity disposeth [[men]] to irresolution, and consequently to lose
the occasions [[occasion]], and fittest opportunities of action. for after [[men]] have
been in deliberation till the [[time]] of action approach, if it be not
then manifest what is [[best]] to be done, tis a signe, the difference of
motives, the one way and the other, are not [[great]]: therefore not to
resolve then, is to lose the [[occasion]] by weighing of trifles; which is
pusillanimity.

frugality,(though in [[poor]] [[men]] a vertue,) maketh a [[man]] unapt to atchieve
such actions, as require the [[strength]] of many [[men]] at once: for it
weakeneth their endeavour, which is to be nourished and kept in vigor by
reward.

confidence in others from ignorance of the marks of wisdome and
kindnesse eloquence, with [[flattery]], disposeth [[men]] to confide in them
that have it; because the former is seeming wisdome, the later seeming
kindnesse. adde to them [[military]] [[reputation]], and it disposeth [[men]] to
adhaere, and [[subject]] themselves to those [[men]] that have them. the two
former, having given them caution against danger from him; the later
gives them caution against danger from others.




and from the ignorance of naturall causes

want of [[science]], that is, ignorance of causes, disposeth, or rather
constraineth a [[man]] to rely on the advise, and [[authority]] of others. for
all [[men]] whom the [[truth]] concernes, if they rely not on their own,
must rely on the [[opinion]] of some other, whom they [[think]] wiser than
themselves, and see not why he should [[deceive]] them.




and from want of understanding

ignorance of the signification of words; which is, want of
understanding, disposeth [[men]] to take on trust, not onely the [[truth]] they
know not; but also the errors; and which is more, the non-sense of them
they trust: for neither error, nor non-sense, can without a perfect
understanding of words, be detected.

from the same it proceedeth, that [[men]] give different names, to one and
the same thing, from the difference of their own [[passions]]: as they that
approve a private [[opinion]], call it [[opinion]]; but they that mislike it,
haeresie: and yet haeresie signifies no more than private [[opinion]]; but
has onely a greater tincture of choler.

from the same also it proceedeth, that [[men]] cannot distinguish, without
study and [[great]] understanding, between one action of many [[men]], and many
actions of one multitude; as for [[example]], between the one action of
all the senators of [[rome]] in killing catiline, and the many actions of a
number of senators in killing caesar; and therefore are disposed to take
for the action of the [[people]], that which is a multitude of actions done
by a multitude of [[men]], [[led]] perhaps by the perswasion of one.

adhaerence to custome, from ignorance of the [[nature]] of [[right]] and wrong
ignorance of the causes, and originall [[constitution]] of [[right]], equity,
law, and [[justice]], disposeth a [[man]] to make custome and [[example]] the rule
of his actions; in such manner, as to [[think]] that [[unjust]] which it
hath been the custome to punish; and that just, of the impunity and
approbation whereof they can [[produce]] an [[example]], or (as the lawyers
which onely use the false measure of [[justice]] barbarously call it) a
precedent; like little [[children]], that have no other [[rule]] of [[good]] and
evill manners, but the correction they receive from their parents, and
masters; save that [[children]] are constant to their [[rule]], whereas [[men]] are
not so; because grown [[strong]], and stubborn, they appeale from custome
to [[reason]], and from [[reason]] to custome, as it serves their turn; receding
from custome when their interest requires it, and setting themselves
against [[reason]], as oft as [[reason]] is against them: which is the cause,
that the doctrine of [[right]] and [[wrong]], is perpetually disputed, both by
the pen and the [[sword]]: whereas the doctrine of lines, and figures, is
not so; because [[men]] [[care]] not, in that [[subject]] what be [[truth]], as a thing
that crosses no mans [[man]] [[ambition]], [[profit]], or [[lust]]. for i [[doubt]] not, but if
it had been a thing contrary to any mans [[man]] [[right]] of dominion, or to the
interest of [[men]] that have dominion, that the three angles of a triangle
should be equall to two angles of a square; that doctrine should have
been, if not disputed, yet by the burning of all books [[book]] of geometry,
suppressed, as farre as he whom it concerned was able.

adhaerence to private [[men]], from ignorance of the causes of peace
ignorance of remote causes, disposeth [[men]] to attribute all events, to
the causes immediate, and instrumentall: for these are all the causes
they perceive. and hence it comes to passe, that in all places, [[men]] that
are [[grieved]] with payments to the publique, discharge their anger upon
the publicans, that is to say, farmers [[farmer]], collectors, and other officers
of the publique [[revenue]]; and adhaere to such as find [[fault]] with the
publike [[government]]; and thereby, when they have engaged themselves
beyond [[hope]] of justification, fall also upon the supreme [[authority]], for
feare of [[punishment]], or shame of receiving pardon.




credulity from ignorance of nature

ignorance of naturall causes disposeth a [[man]] to credulity, so as
to [[believe]] many times [[time]] impossibilities: for such [[know]] nothing to
the contrary, but that they may be true; being unable to detect the
impossibility. and credulity, because [[men]] [[love]] to be hearkened unto in
company, disposeth them to lying: so that ignorance it selfe without
malice, is able to make a [[man]] bothe to [[believe]] lyes, and tell them; and
sometimes also to invent them.




curiosity to [[know]], from [[care]] of future time

anxiety for the future [[time]], disposeth [[men]] to enquire into the causes
of things: because the [[knowledge]] of them, maketh [[men]] the [[better]] able to
order the [[present]] to their [[best]] advantage.




naturall [[religion]], from the same

curiosity, or [[love]] of the [[knowledge]] of causes, draws a [[man]] from
consideration of the effect, to seek the cause; and again, the cause of
that cause; till of necessity he must come to this [[thought]] at [[last]], that
there is some cause, whereof there is no former cause, but is eternall;
which is it [[men]] call [[god]]. so that it is impossible to make any profound
enquiry into naturall causes, without being enclined thereby to believe
there is one [[god]] eternall; though they cannot have any [[idea]] of him in
their [[mind]], answerable to his [[nature]]. for as a [[man]] that is born blind,
hearing [[men]] talk of warming themselves by the [[fire]], and being brought
to warm himself by the same, may easily conceive, and assure himselfe,
there is somewhat there, which [[men]] call [[fire]], and is the cause of the
heat he feeles; but cannot imagine what it is like; nor have an [[idea]] of
it in his [[mind]], such as they have that see it: so also, by the visible
things of this [[world]], and their admirable order, a [[man]] may conceive
there is a cause of them, which [[men]] call [[god]]; and yet not have an [[idea]],
or image of him in his [[mind]].

and they that make little, or no enquiry into the naturall causes of
things, yet from the feare that proceeds from the ignorance it selfe,
of what it is that hath the [[power]] to do them much [[good]] or harm, are
enclined to suppose, and feign unto themselves, severall kinds [[kind]] of powers
invisible; and to stand in awe of their own imaginations [[imagination]]; and in time
of distresse to invoke them; as also in the [[time]] of an expected good
successe, to give them thanks; making the creatures of their own
fancy, their gods. by which means it hath come to passe, that from the
innumerable variety of fancy, [[men]] have created in the [[world]] innumerable
sorts of gods. and this feare of things invisible, is the naturall seed
of that, which every one in himself calleth [[religion]]; and in them that
worship, or feare that [[power]] otherwise than they do, superstition.

and this seed of [[religion]], having been observed by many; some of those
that have observed it, have been enclined thereby to nourish, dresse,
and forme it into lawes; and to adde to it of their own invention,
any [[opinion]] of the causes of future events, by which they [[thought]] they
should [[best]] be able to govern others, and make unto themselves the
greatest use of their powers [[power]].



chapter xii. of religion




religion, in [[man]] onely

seeing there are no signes, nor fruit of [[religion]], but in [[man]] onely;
there is no cause to [[doubt]], but that the seed of [[religion]], is also onely
in [[man]]; and consisteth in some peculiar quality, or at least in some
eminent [[degree]] thereof, not to be found in other living creatures.




first, from his [[desire]] of knowing causes

and first, it is peculiar to the [[nature]] of [[man]], to be inquisitive into
the causes of the events they see, some more, some lesse; but all [[men]] so
much, as to be [[curious]] in the search of the causes of their own [[good]] and
evill [[fortune]].




from the consideration of the beginning of things

secondly, upon the sight of any thing that hath a beginning, to think
also it had a cause, which determined the same to begin, then when it
did, rather than sooner or later.




from his observation of the sequell of things

thirdly, whereas there is no other felicity of beasts, but the enjoying
of their quotidian food, ease, and lusts; as having little, or no
foresight of the [[time]] to come, for want of observation, and memory
of the order, consequence, and dependance of the things they see; man
observeth how one event hath been produced by another; and remembreth in
them antecedence and consequence; and when he cannot assure himselfe of
the true causes of things, (for the causes of [[good]] and evill [[fortune]] for
the most part are invisible,) he supposes causes of them, either such
as his own fancy suggesteth; or trusteth to the [[authority]] of other [[men]],
such as he thinks [[think]] to be his [[friends]], and wiser than himselfe.

the naturall cause of [[religion]], the [[anxiety]] of the [[time]] to come the
two first, make [[anxiety]]. for being assured that there be causes of all
things that have arrived hitherto, or shall arrive hereafter; it is
impossible for a [[man]], who continually endeavoureth to secure himselfe
against the evill he feares, and procure the [[good]] he desireth, not to
be in a perpetuall solicitude of the [[time]] to come; so that every [[man]],
especially those that are over provident, are in an estate like to that
of prometheus. for as prometheus, (which interpreted, is, the prudent
man,) was bound to the hill caucasus, a place of large prospect, where,
an eagle feeding on his liver, devoured in the day, as much as was
repayred in the night: so that [[man]], which looks too far before him, in
the [[care]] of future [[time]], hath his [[heart]] all the day long, gnawed on by
feare of [[death]], [[poverty]], or other calamity; and has no repose, nor pause
of his [[anxiety]], but in sleep.




which makes them [[fear]] the [[power]] of invisible things

this perpetuall feare, alwayes accompanying [[mankind]] in the ignorance of
causes, as it were in the dark, must needs have for object something.
and therefore when there is nothing to be seen, there is nothing to
accuse, either of their [[good]], or evill [[fortune]], but some [[power]], or agent
invisible: in which sense perhaps it was, that some of the old poets
said, that the gods were at first created by humane feare: which spoken
of the gods, (that is to say, of the many gods of the gentiles) is
very true. but the acknowledging of one [[god]] eternall, infinite, and
omnipotent, may more easily be derived, from the [[desire]] [[men]] have to
know the causes of naturall bodies [[body]], and their severall vertues, and
operations; than from the feare of what was to befall them in [[time]] to
come. for he that from any effect hee seeth come to passe, should reason
to the next and immediate cause thereof, and from thence to the cause
of that cause, and plonge himselfe profoundly in the pursuit of causes;
shall at [[last]] come to this, that there must be (as even the heathen
philosophers confessed) one first mover; that is, a first, and an
eternall cause of all things; which is that which [[men]] mean by the name
of [[god]]: and all this without [[thought]] of their [[fortune]]; the solicitude
whereof, both enclines to [[fear]], and hinders them from the search of the
causes of other things; and thereby gives [[occasion]] of feigning of as
many gods, as there be [[men]] that feigne them.




and suppose them incorporeall

and for the matter, or substance of the invisible agents, so fancyed;
they could not by naturall cogitation, fall upon any other conceipt, but
that it was the same with that of the soule of [[man]]; and that the soule
of [[man]], was of the same substance, with that which appeareth in a [[dream]],
to one that sleepeth; or in a looking-glasse, to one that is awake;
which, [[men]] not knowing that such apparitions are nothing else but
creatures of the fancy, [[think]] to be reall, and externall substances;
and therefore call them ghosts; as the latines called them imagines,
and umbrae; and [[thought]] them spirits, that is, thin aereall bodies [[body]]; and
those invisible agents, which they feared, to bee like them; save that
they appear, and vanish when they please. but the [[opinion]] that such
spirits were incorporeall, or immateriall, could never enter into the
mind of any [[man]] by [[nature]]; because, though [[men]] may put together words of
contradictory signification, as spirit, and incorporeall; yet they
can never have the [[imagination]] of any thing answering to them:
and therefore, [[men]] that by their own meditation, arrive to the
acknowledgement of one infinite, omnipotent, and eternall [[god]],
choose rather to confesse he is incomprehensible, and above their
understanding; than to define his [[nature]] by spirit incorporeall, and
then confesse their definition to be unintelligible: or if they give him
such a title, it is not dogmatically, with intention to make the divine
nature understood; but piously, to [[honour]] him with attributes, of
significations, as remote as they can from the grossenesse of bodies
visible.




but [[know]] not the way how they effect anything

then, for the way by which they [[think]] these invisible agents wrought
their effects; that is to say, what immediate causes they used, in
bringing things to passe, [[men]] that [[know]] not what it is that we call
causing, (that is, almost all men) have no other [[rule]] to guesse by, but
by observing, and remembring what they have seen to precede the like
effect at some other [[time]], or times [[time]] before, without seeing between the
antecedent and subsequent event, any dependance or connexion at all:
and therefore from the like things [[past]], they expect the like things to
come; and [[hope]] for [[good]] or evill [[luck]], superstitiously, from things that
have no part at all in the causing of it: as the athenians did for their
war at lepanto, demand another phormio; the pompeian faction for their
warre in afrique, another scipio; and others have done in divers other
occasions since. in like manner they attribute their [[fortune]] to a
stander by, to a lucky or unlucky place, to words spoken, especially
if the name of [[god]] be amongst them; as charming, and conjuring (the
leiturgy of witches;) insomuch as to [[believe]], they have [[power]] to turn a
stone into bread, bread into a [[man]], or any thing, into any thing.




but [[honour]] them as they [[honour]] men

thirdly, for the [[worship]] which naturally [[men]] exhibite to powers
invisible, it can be no other, but such expressions of their reverence,
as they would use towards [[men]]; gifts, petitions, thanks, submission
of [[body]], considerate addresses, sober behaviour, premeditated words,
swearing (that is, assuring one another of their promises,) by invoking
them. beyond that [[reason]] suggesteth nothing; but leaves them either to
rest there; or for further ceremonies [[ceremony]], to rely on those they [[believe]] to
be wiser than themselves.




and attribute to them all extraordinary events

lastly, concerning how these invisible powers [[power]] declare to [[men]] the things
which shall hereafter come to passe, especially concerning their good
or evill [[fortune]] in generall, or [[good]] or ill successe in any particular
undertaking, [[men]] are naturally at a stand; save that using to conjecture
of the [[time]] to come, by the [[time]] [[past]], they are very apt, not onely to
take casuall things, after one or two encounters, for prognostiques
of the like encounter ever after, but also to [[believe]] the like
prognostiques from other [[men]], of whom they have once conceived a good
opinion.




foure things, naturall seeds of religion

and in these foure things, [[opinion]] of ghosts, ignorance of second
causes, devotion towards what [[men]] [[fear]], and taking of things casuall for
prognostiques, consisteth the naturall seed of [[religion]]; which by reason
of the different fancies, judgements, and [[passions]] of severall [[men]], hath
grown up into ceremonies [[ceremony]] so different, that those which are used by one
man, are for the most part ridiculous to another.




made different by culture

for these seeds have received [[culture]] from two sorts of [[men]]. one sort
have been they, that have nourished, and ordered them, according to
their own invention. the other, have done it, by gods commandement, and
direction: but both sorts have done it, with a [[purpose]] to make those men
that relyed on them, the more apt to [[obedience]], lawes, [[peace]], charity,
and civill [[society]]. so that the [[religion]] of the former sort, is a part
of humane politiques; and teacheth part of the [[duty]] which earthly kings
require of their subjects [[subject]]. and the [[religion]] of the later sort is
divine politiques; and containeth precepts to those that have yeelded
themselves subjects [[subject]] in the kingdome of [[god]]. of the former sort, were all
the founders of common-wealths, and the law-givers of the gentiles: of
the later sort, were [[abraham]], [[moses]], and our blessed saviour; by whom
have been derived unto us the lawes of the kingdome of [[god]].




the absurd [[opinion]] of gentilisme

and for that part of [[religion]], which consisteth in opinions [[opinion]] concerning
the [[nature]] of powers [[power]] invisible, there is almost nothing that has a
name, that has not been esteemed amongst the gentiles, in one place or
another, a [[god]], or divell; or by their poets feigned to be inanimated,
inhabited, or possessed by some spirit or other.

the unformed matter of the [[world]], was a [[god]], by the name of [[chaos]].

the [[heaven]], the ocean, the planets, the [[fire]], the [[earth]], the winds, were
so many gods.

men, [[women]], a bird, a crocodile, a calf, a dogge, a snake, an onion,
a leeke, deified. besides, that they filled almost all places, with
spirits called daemons; the plains, with pan, and panises, or satyres;
the woods, with fawnes, and nymphs [[nymph]]; the sea, with tritons, and other
nymphs; every river, and fountayn, with a ghost of his name, and with
nymphs; every house, with it lares, or familiars; every [[man]], with his
genius; hell, with ghosts, and spirituall officers, as charon, cerberus,
and the furies; and in the night [[time]], all places with larvae, lemures,
ghosts of [[men]] deceased, and a whole kingdome of fayries, and bugbears.
they have also ascribed divinity, and built temples to meer accidents,
and qualities; such as are [[time]], night, day, [[peace]], concord, [[love]],
contention, vertue, [[honour]], health, rust, fever, and the like; which
when they prayed for, or against, they prayed to, as if there were
ghosts of those names hanging over their heads, and letting fall, or
withholding that [[good]], or evill, for, or against which they prayed. they
invoked also their own wit, by the name of muses; their own ignorance,
by the name of [[fortune]]; their own [[lust]], by the name of cupid; their
own rage, by the name furies; their own privy members by the name of
priapus; and attributed their pollutions, to incubi, and succubae:
insomuch as there was nothing, which a poet could introduce as a person
in his poem, which they did not make either a [[god]], or a divel.

the same authors of the [[religion]] of the gentiles, observing the second
ground for [[religion]], which is mens [[men]] ignorance of causes; and thereby
their aptnesse to attribute their [[fortune]] to causes, on which there
was no dependence at all apparent, took [[occasion]] to obtrude on their
ignorance, in stead of second causes, a [[kind]] of second and ministeriall
gods; ascribing the cause of foecundity, to [[venus]]; the cause of [[arts]], to
apollo; of subtilty and craft, to mercury; of tempests and stormes,
to aeolus; and of other effects, to other gods: insomuch as there was
amongst the heathen almost as [[great]] variety of gods, as of businesse.

and to the [[worship]], which naturally [[men]] conceived fit to bee used
towards their gods, namely oblations, prayers, thanks, and the rest
formerly named; the same legislators of the gentiles have added their
images, both in picture, and sculpture; that the more ignorant sort,
(that is to say, the most part, or generality of the [[people]],) thinking
the gods for whose representation they were made, were really included,
and as it were housed within them, might so much the more stand in feare
of them: and endowed them with lands [[land]], and houses, and officers, and
revenues, set apart from all other humane uses; that is, consecrated,
and made holy to those their idols; as caverns, groves, woods,
mountains, and whole ilands; and have attributed to them, not onely
the shapes, some of [[men]], some of beasts, some of monsters; but also the
faculties, and [[passions]] of [[men]] and beasts; as sense, [[speech]], [[sex]], [[lust]],
generation, (and this not onely by mixing one with another, to propagate
the [[kind]] of gods; but also by mixing with [[men]], and [[women]], to beget
mongrill gods, and but inmates of [[heaven]], as bacchus, hercules,
and others;) besides, anger, [[revenge]], and other [[passions]] of living
creatures, and the actions proceeding from them, as fraud, theft,
adultery, sodomie, and any [[vice]] that may be taken for an effect of
power, or a cause of [[pleasure]]; and all such vices [[vice]], as amongst [[men]] are
taken to be against [[law]], rather than against [[honour]].

lastly, to the prognostiques of [[time]] to come; which are naturally, but
conjectures upon the [[experience]] of [[time]] [[past]]; and supernaturall, divine
revelation; the same authors of the [[religion]] of the gentiles, partly
upon pretended [[experience]], partly upon pretended revelation, have
added innumerable other [[superstitious]] wayes of divination; and made men
believe they should find their fortunes [[fortune]], sometimes in the ambiguous
or senslesse answers [[answer]] of the priests [[priest]] at delphi, delos, ammon, and other
famous oracles; which answers [[answer]], were made ambiguous by designe, to own
the event both wayes; or absurd by the intoxicating vapour of the place,
which is very frequent in sulphurous cavernes: sometimes in the leaves
of the sibills; of whose prophecyes (like those perhaps of nostradamus;
for the fragments now extant seem to be the invention of later times)
there were some books [[book]] in [[reputation]] in the [[time]] of the roman republique:
sometimes in the insignificant speeches [[speech]] of mad-men, supposed to
be possessed with a [[divine]] spirit; which possession they called
enthusiasme; and these kinds [[kind]] of foretelling events, were accounted
theomancy, or prophecy; sometimes in the aspect of the starres at their
nativity; which was called horoscopy, and esteemed a part of judiciary
astrology: sometimes in their own hopes [[hope]] and feares, called thumomancy,
or presage: sometimes in the prediction of witches, that pretended
conference with the [[dead]]; which is called necromancy, conjuring, and
witchcraft; and is but juggling and confederate knavery: sometimes in
the casuall flight, or feeding of birds; called augury: sometimes in
the entrayles of a sacrificed beast; which was aruspicina: sometimes
in dreams [[dream]]: sometimes in croaking of ravens, or chattering of birds:
sometimes in the lineaments of the face; which was called metoposcopy;
or by palmistry in the lines of the hand; in casuall words, called
omina: sometimes in monsters, or unusuall accidents; as ecclipses,
comets, rare meteors, earthquakes, inundations, uncouth births, and the
like, which they called portenta and ostenta, because they [[thought]] them
to portend, or foreshew some [[great]] calamity to come; sometimes, in meer
lottery, as crosse and pile; counting holes in a sive; dipping of verses
in [[homer]], and [[virgil]]; and innumerable other such vaine conceipts. so
easie are [[men]] to be drawn to [[believe]] any thing, from such [[men]] as have
gotten credit with them; and can with gentlenesse, and dexterity, take
hold of their [[fear]], and ignorance.

the designes of the authors of the [[religion]] of the heathen and therefore
the first founders, and legislators of common-wealths amongst the
gentiles, whose ends were only to keep the [[people]] in [[obedience]], and
peace, have in all places taken [[care]]; first, to imprint in their minds [[mind]] a
beliefe, that those precepts which they gave concerning [[religion]], might
not be [[thought]] to proceed from their own device, but from the dictates
of some [[god]], or other spirit; or else that they themselves were of a
higher [[nature]] than mere mortalls, that their lawes might the more easily
be received: so numa pompilius pretended to receive the ceremonies [[ceremony]] he
instituted amongst the romans, from the [[nymph]] egeria: and the first king
and founder of the kingdome of peru, pretended himselfe and his [[wife]] to
be the [[children]] of the sunne: and mahomet, to set up his new [[religion]],
pretended to have conferences with the holy ghost, in forme of a dove.
secondly, they have had a [[care]], to make it believed, that the same
things were displeasing to the gods, which were forbidden by the
lawes. thirdly, to prescribe ceremonies [[ceremony]], supplications, sacrifices [[sacrifice]], and
festivalls, by which they were to [[believe]], the anger of the gods might
be appeased; and that ill [[success]] in [[war]], [[great]] contagions of sicknesse,
earthquakes, and each mans [[man]] private misery, came from the anger of
the gods; and their anger from the neglect of their [[worship]], or the
forgetting, or mistaking some point of the ceremonies [[ceremony]] required. and
though amongst the antient romans, [[men]] were not forbidden to deny, that
which in the poets is written of the paines, and pleasures [[pleasure]] after this
life; which divers of [[great]] [[authority]], and gravity in that [[state]] have
in their harangues openly derided; yet that beliefe was alwaies more
cherished, than the contrary.

and by these, and such other [[institutions]], they obtayned in order to
their end, (which was the [[peace]] of the commonwealth,) that the common
people in their misfortunes, laying the [[fault]] on neglect, or errour in
their ceremonies [[ceremony]], or on their own disobedience to the lawes, were the
lesse apt to mutiny against their governors. and being entertained with
the pomp, and pastime of festivalls, and publike gomes, made in
honour of the gods, needed nothing else but bread, to keep them from
discontent, murmuring, and commotion against the [[state]]. and therefore
the romans, that had conquered the [[greatest]] part of the then known
world, made no scruple of tollerating any [[religion]] whatsoever in the
city of [[rome]] it selfe; unlesse it had somthing in it, that could not
consist with their civill [[government]]; nor do we [[read]], that any religion
was there forbidden, but that of the jewes; who (being the peculiar
kingdome of god) [[thought]] it unlawfull to acknowledge subjection to any
mortall [[king]] or [[state]] whatsoever. and thus you see how the [[religion]] of
the gentiles was a part of their policy.

the true [[religion]], and the lawes of gods kingdome the same but where god
himselfe, by supernaturall revelation, planted [[religion]]; there he
also made to himselfe a peculiar kingdome; and gave lawes, not only of
behaviour towards himselfe; but also towards one another; and thereby
in the kingdome of [[god]], the policy, and lawes civill, are a part of
religion; and therefore the distinction of temporall, and spirituall
domination, hath there no place. it is true, that [[god]] is [[king]] of all the
earth: yet may he be [[king]] of a peculiar, and chosen nation. for there is
no more incongruity therein, than that he that hath the generall command
of the whole [[army]], should have withall a peculiar regiment, or company
of his own. [[god]] is [[king]] of all the [[earth]] by his [[power]]: but of his
chosen [[people]], he is [[king]] by covenant. but to speake more largly of the
kingdome of [[god]], both by [[nature]], and covenant, i have in the following
discourse assigned an other place.




the causes of [[change]] in religion

from the propagation of [[religion]], it is not hard to understand
the causes of the resolution of the same into its first seeds, or
principles; which are only an [[opinion]] of a deity, and powers [[power]] invisible,
and supernaturall; that can never be so abolished out of humane [[nature]],
but that new religions [[religion]] may againe be made to spring out of them, by the
culture of such [[men]], as for such [[purpose]] are in [[reputation]].

for seeing all formed [[religion]], is founded at first, upon the faith
which a multitude hath in some one [[person]], whom they [[believe]] not only to
be a [[wise]] [[man]], and to [[labour]] to procure their [[happiness]], but also to
be a holy [[man]], to whom [[god]] himselfe vouchsafeth to declare his will
supernaturally; it followeth necessarily, when they that have the
goverment of [[religion]], shall come to have either the wisedome of those
men, their sincerity, or their [[love]] suspected; or that they shall
be unable to shew any probable token of [[divine]] revelation; that the
religion which they [[desire]] to uphold, must be suspected likewise; and
(without the feare of the civill sword) contradicted and rejected.




injoyning beleefe of impossibilities

that which taketh away the [[reputation]] of wisedome, in him that formeth
a [[religion]], or addeth to it when it is allready formed, is the enjoyning
of a beliefe of contradictories: for both parts of a contradiction
cannot possibly be true: and therefore to enjoyne the beliefe of them,
is an argument of ignorance; which detects the author in that; and
discredits him in all things else he shall propound as from revelation
supernaturall: which revelation a [[man]] may indeed have of many things
above, but of nothing against naturall [[reason]].




doing contrary to the [[religion]] they establish

that which taketh away the [[reputation]] of sincerity, is the doing, or
saying of such things, as appeare to be signes, that what they require
other [[men]] to [[believe]], is not believed by themselves; all which doings,
or sayings are therefore called scandalous, because they be stumbling
blocks, that make [[men]] to fall in the way of [[religion]]: as [[injustice]],
cruelty, prophanesse, avarice, and luxury. for who can [[believe]], that he
that doth ordinarily such actions, as proceed from any of these
rootes, believeth there is any such invisible [[power]] to be feared, as he
affrighteth other [[men]] withall, for lesser faults [[fault]]?

that which taketh away the [[reputation]] of [[love]], is the being detected of
private ends: as when the beliefe they require of others, conduceth or
seemeth to conduce to the acquiring of dominion, riches [[rich]], [[dignity]], or
secure [[pleasure]], to themselves onely, or specially. for that which men
reap benefit by to themselves, they are [[thought]] to do for their own
sakes, and not for [[love]] of others




want of the testimony of miracles

lastly, the testimony that [[men]] can render of [[divine]] calling, can be no
other, than the operation of [[miracles]]; or true prophecy, (which also is
a miracle;) or extraordinary felicity. and therefore, to those points
of [[religion]], which have been received from them that did such [[miracles]];
those that are added by such, as approve not their calling by some
miracle, obtain no greater beliefe, than what the custome, and lawes of
the places, in which they be educated, have wrought into them. for as
in naturall things, [[men]] of judgement require naturall signes,
and arguments; so in supernaturall things, they require signes
supernaturall, (which are [[miracles]],) before they [[consent]] inwardly, and
from their hearts [[heart]].

all which causes of the weakening of mens [[men]] [[faith]], do manifestly appear
in the examples [[example]] following. first, we have the [[example]] of the children
of [[israel]]; who when [[moses]], that had approved his calling to them by
miracles, and by the [[happy]] conduct of them out of [[egypt]], was absent but
40 dayes, revolted from the [[worship]] of the true [[god]], recommended to
them by him; and setting up (exod.32 1,2) a golden calfe for their [[god]],
relapsed into the idolatry of the [[egyptians]]; from whom they had been
so lately delivered. and again, after [[moses]], aaron, joshua, and that
generation which had seen the [[great]] works [[work]] of [[god]] in [[israel]], (judges
2 11) were [[dead]]; another [[generation]] arose, and served baal. so that
miracles fayling, [[faith]] also failed.

again, when the sons [[son]] of samuel, (1 sam.8.3) being constituted by their
father judges [[judge]] in bersabee, received bribes, and judged unjustly, the
people of [[israel]] refused any more to have [[god]] to be their [[king]], in other
manner than he was [[king]] of other [[people]]; and therefore cryed out to
samuel, to choose them a [[king]] after the manner of the nations. so that
justice fayling, [[faith]] also fayled: insomuch, as they deposed their [[god]],
from reigning over them.

and whereas in the planting of [[christian]] [[religion]], the oracles ceased
in all parts of the roman [[empire]], and the number of christians [[christian]] encreased
wonderfully every day, and in every place, by the preaching of the
apostles, and evangelists; a [[great]] part of that successe, may reasonably
be attributed, to the contempt, into which the priests [[priest]] of the gentiles
of that [[time]], had brought themselves, by their uncleannesse, avarice,
and jugling between princes [[prince]]. also the [[religion]] of the [[church]] of [[rome]],
was partly, for the same cause abolished in [[england]], and many other
parts of christendome; insomuch, as the fayling of vertue in the
pastors, maketh [[faith]] faile in the [[people]]: and partly from bringing
of the [[philosophy]], and doctrine of [[aristotle]] into [[religion]], by the
schoole-men; from whence there arose so many contradictions, and
absurdities, as brought the clergy into a [[reputation]] both of ignorance,
and of fraudulent intention; and enclined [[people]] to revolt from them,
either against the will of their own princes [[prince]], as in [[france]], and holland;
or with their will, as in [[england]].

lastly, amongst the points by the [[church]] of [[rome]] declared necessary for
salvation, there be so many, manifestly to the advantage of the [[pope]],
and of his spirituall subjects [[subject]], residing in the territories of other
christian princes [[prince]], that were it not for the mutuall emulation of those
princes, they might without warre, or trouble, exclude all forraign
authority, as easily as it has been excluded in [[england]]. for who is
there that does not see, to whose benefit it conduceth, to have it
believed, that a [[king]] hath not his [[authority]] from [[christ]], unlesse a
bishop [[crown]] him? that a [[king]], if he be a [[priest]], cannot [[marry]]? that
whether a [[prince]] be born in lawfull [[marriage]], or not, must be judged by
authority from [[rome]]? that subjects [[subject]] may be freed from their alleageance,
if by the court of [[rome]], the [[king]] be judged an heretique? that a king
(as chilperique of france) may be deposed by a [[pope]] (as [[pope]] zachary,)
for no cause; and his kingdome given to one of his subjects [[subject]]? that the
clergy, and regulars, in what [[country]] soever, shall be exempt from the
jurisdiction of their [[king]], in cases criminall? or who does not see, to
whose [[profit]] redound the fees of private masses, and vales of [[purgatory]];
with other signes of private interest, enough to mortifie the most
lively [[faith]], if (as i sayd) the civill magistrate, and custome did not
more sustain it, than any [[opinion]] they have of the [[sanctity]], wisdome,
or probity of their teachers? so that i may attribute all the changes
of [[religion]] in the [[world]], to one and the some cause; and that is,
unpleasing priests [[priest]]; and those not onely amongst catholiques, but even in
that [[church]] that hath presumed most of reformation.



chapter xiii. of the naturall condition of [[mankind]],
as concerning their felicity, and misery


nature hath made [[men]] so equall, in the faculties of [[body]], and [[mind]]; as
that though there bee found one [[man]] sometimes manifestly stronger
in [[body]], or of quicker [[mind]] then another; yet when all is reckoned
together, the difference between [[man]], and [[man]], is not so considerable,
as that one [[man]] can thereupon claim to himselfe any benefit, to which
another may not pretend, as well as he. for as to the [[strength]] of [[body]],
the weakest has [[strength]] enough to kill the strongest, either by secret
machination, or by confederacy with others, that are in the same danger
with himselfe.

and as to the faculties of the [[mind]], (setting aside the [[arts]] grounded
upon words, and especially that [[skill]] of proceeding upon generall, and
infallible rules [[rule]], called [[science]]; which very few have, and but in few
things; as being not a native faculty, born with us; nor attained,
(as prudence,) while we look after somewhat els,) i find yet a greater
equality amongst [[men]], than that of [[strength]]. for prudence, is but
experience; which equall [[time]], equally bestowes on all [[men]], in those
things they equally apply themselves unto. that which may perhaps make
such equality incredible, is but a [[vain]] conceipt of ones owne wisdome,
which almost all [[men]] [[think]] they have in a greater [[degree]], than the
vulgar; that is, than all [[men]] but themselves, and a few others, whom by
fame, or for concurring with themselves, they approve. for such is the
nature of [[men]], that howsoever they may acknowledge many others to be
more witty, or more eloquent, or more learned; yet they will hardly
believe there be many so [[wise]] as themselves: for they see their own wit
at hand, and other mens [[men]] at a distance. but this proveth rather that men
are in that point equall, than unequall. for there is not ordinarily a
greater signe of the equall distribution of any thing, than that every
man is contented with his share.




from equality proceeds diffidence

from this equality of ability, ariseth equality of [[hope]] in the attaining
of our ends. and therefore if any two [[men]] [[desire]] the same thing, which
neverthelesse they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies [[enemy]]; and in the
way to their end, (which is principally their owne conservation, and
sometimes their delectation only,) endeavour to [[destroy]], or subdue one
an other. and from hence it comes to passe, that where an invader hath
no more to feare, than an other mans [[man]] [[single]] [[power]]; if one plant, sow,
build, or possesse a convenient seat, others may probably be expected to
come prepared with forces [[force]] [[united]], to dispossesse, and deprive him, not
only of the fruit of his [[labour]], but also of his [[life]], or [[liberty]]. and
the invader again is in the like danger of another.




from diffidence warre

and from this diffidence of one another, there is no way for any [[man]] to
secure himselfe, so reasonable, as anticipation; that is, by [[force]], or
wiles, to master the persons [[person]] of all [[men]] he can, so long, till he see no
other [[power]] [[great]] enough to endanger him: and this is no more than his
own conservation requireth, and is generally allowed. also because there
be some, that taking [[pleasure]] in contemplating their own [[power]] in
the acts of [[conquest]], which they pursue farther than their security
requires; if others, that otherwise would be glad to be at ease within
modest bounds, should not by [[invasion]] increase their [[power]], they would
not be able, long [[time]], by standing only on their defence, to subsist.
and by consequence, such augmentation of dominion over [[men]], being
necessary to a mans [[man]] conservation, it ought to be allowed him.

againe, [[men]] have no [[pleasure]], (but on the contrary a [[great]] deale of
griefe) in keeping company, where there is no [[power]] able to over-awe
them all. for every [[man]] looketh that his companion should value him, at
the same rate he sets upon himselfe: and upon all signes of contempt,
or undervaluing, naturally endeavours, as far as he dares (which amongst
them that have no [[common]] [[power]], to keep them in quiet, is far enough
to make them [[destroy]] each other,) to extort a greater value from his
contemners, by dommage; and from others, by the [[example]].

so that in the [[nature]] of [[man]], we find three principall causes of
quarrel. first, competition; secondly, diffidence; thirdly, [[glory]].

the first, maketh [[men]] invade for gain; the second, for safety; and
the third, for [[reputation]]. the first use [[violence]], to make themselves
masters of other mens [[men]] persons [[person]], wives [[wife]], [[children]], and cattell; the second,
to defend them; the third, for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different
opinion, and any other signe of undervalue, either direct in their
persons, or by reflexion in their kindred, their [[friends]], their nation,
their profession, or their name.




out of civil states, there is alwayes warre of every one against every
one

hereby it is manifest, that during the [[time]] [[men]] [[live]] without a common
power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is
called warre; and such a warre, as is of every [[man]], against every [[man]].
for warre, consisteth not in battell onely, or the act of fighting; but
in a tract of [[time]], wherein the will to contend by battell is
sufficiently known: and therefore the notion of [[time]], is to be
considered in the [[nature]] of warre; as it is in the [[nature]] of weather.
for as the [[nature]] of foule weather, lyeth not in a showre or two of
rain; but in an inclination thereto of many dayes together: so the
nature of [[war]], consisteth not in actuall fighting; but in the known
disposition thereto, during all the [[time]] there is no assurance to the
contrary. all other [[time]] is [[peace]].




the incommodites of such a war

whatsoever therefore is consequent to a [[time]] of warre, where every man
is [[enemy]] to every [[man]]; the same is consequent to the [[time]], wherein men
live without other security, than what their own [[strength]], and their
own invention shall furnish them withall. in such condition, there is
no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and
consequently no [[culture]] of the [[earth]]; no navigation, nor use of the
commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no
instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much [[force]];
no [[knowledge]] of the face of the [[earth]]; no account of [[time]]; no [[arts]]; no
letters; no [[society]]; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and
danger of [[violent]] [[death]]; and the [[life]] of [[man]], solitary, poore, nasty,
brutish, and short.

it may seem [[strange]] to some [[man]], that has not well weighed these things;
that [[nature]] should thus dissociate, and render [[men]] apt to invade,
and [[destroy]] one another: and he may therefore, not trusting to this
inference, made from the [[passions]], [[desire]] perhaps to have the same
confirmed by [[experience]]. let him therefore consider with himselfe, when
taking a [[journey]], he armes himselfe, and seeks to go well accompanied;
when going to sleep, he locks his dores; when even in his house he
locks his chests; and this when he knows [[know]] there bee lawes, and publike
officers, armed, to [[revenge]] all injuries shall bee done him; what
opinion he has of his fellow subjects [[subject]], when he rides armed; of his
fellow [[citizens]], when he locks his dores; and of his [[children]], and
servants, when he locks his chests. does he not there as much accuse
mankind by his actions, as i do by my words? but neither of us accuse
mans [[nature]] in it. the desires [[desire]], and other [[passions]] of [[man]], are in
themselves no [[sin]]. no more are the actions, that proceed from those
passions, till they [[know]] a [[law]] that forbids them; which till lawes be
made they cannot [[know]]: nor can any [[law]] be made, till they have agreed
upon the [[person]] that shall make it.

it may peradventure be [[thought]], there was never such a [[time]], nor
condition of warre as this; and i [[believe]] it was never generally so,
over all the [[world]]: but there are many places, where they [[live]] so now.
for the savage [[people]] in many places of [[america]], except the government
of small families [[family]], the concord whereof dependeth on naturall [[lust]], have
no [[government]] at all; and [[live]] at this day in that brutish manner, as
i said before. howsoever, it may be perceived what manner of [[life]] there
would be, where there were no [[common]] [[power]] to feare; by the manner of
life, which [[men]] that have formerly lived under a peacefull [[government]],
use to degenerate into, in a civill warre.

but though there had never been any [[time]], wherein particular [[men]] were in
a condition of warre one against another; yet in all times [[time]], kings [[king]], and
persons of soveraigne [[authority]], because of their independency, are
in continuall jealousies, and in the [[state]] and posture of gladiators;
having their [[weapons]] pointing, and their [[eyes]] fixed on one another;
that is, their forts, garrisons, and guns upon the frontiers of their
kingdomes; and continuall spyes upon their neighbours; which is a
posture of [[war]]. but because they uphold thereby, the industry of their
subjects; there does not [[follow]] from it, that misery, which accompanies
the [[liberty]] of particular [[men]].




in such a warre, nothing is unjust

to this warre of every [[man]] against every [[man]], this also is consequent;
that nothing can be [[unjust]]. the notions of [[right]] and [[wrong]], [[justice]] and
injustice have there no place. where there is no [[common]] [[power]], there is
no [[law]]: where no [[law]], no [[injustice]]. [[force]], and fraud, are in warre the
two cardinall vertues. [[justice]], and [[injustice]] are none of the faculties
neither of the [[body]], nor [[mind]]. if they were, they might be in a [[man]] that
were alone in the [[world]], as well as his senses, and [[passions]]. they
are qualities, that relate to [[men]] in [[society]], not in solitude. it is
consequent also to the same condition, that there be no propriety, no
dominion, no mine and thine distinct; but onely that to be every mans
that he can get; and for so long, as he can keep it. and thus much
for the ill condition, which [[man]] by meer [[nature]] is actually placed in;
though with a possibility to come out of it, consisting partly in the
passions, partly in his [[reason]].




the [[passions]] that incline [[men]] to peace

the [[passions]] that encline [[men]] to [[peace]], are feare of [[death]]; [[desire]] of
such things as are necessary to commodious living; and a [[hope]] by their
industry to obtain them. and [[reason]] suggesteth convenient articles of
peace, upon which [[men]] may be drawn to agreement. these articles, are
they, which otherwise are called the lawes of [[nature]]: whereof i shall
speak more particularly, in the two following chapters [[chapter]].



chapter xiv. of the first and second naturall lawes, and of contracts




right of [[nature]] what

the [[right]] of [[nature]], which writers commonly call jus naturale, is the
liberty each [[man]] hath, to use his own [[power]], as he will himselfe, for
the preservation of his own [[nature]]; that is to say, of his own [[life]];
and consequently, of doing any thing, which in his own judgement, and
reason, hee shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto.




liberty what

by [[liberty]], is understood, according to the proper signification of the
word, the absence of externall impediments: which impediments, may oft
take away part of a mans [[man]] [[power]] to do what hee would; but cannot hinder
him from using the [[power]] left him, according as his judgement, and
reason shall dictate to him.




a [[law]] of [[nature]] what

a [[law]] of [[nature]], (lex naturalis,) is a precept, or generall [[rule]],
found out by [[reason]], by which a [[man]] is forbidden to do, that, which
is destructive of his [[life]], or taketh away the means of preserving the
same; and to omit, that, by which he thinketh it may be [[best]] preserved.
for though they that speak of this [[subject]], use to confound jus, and
lex, [[right]] and [[law]]; yet they ought to be distinguished; because [[right]],
consisteth in [[liberty]] to do, or to forbeare; whereas [[law]], determineth,
and bindeth to one of them: so that [[law]], and [[right]], differ as much,
as obligation, and [[liberty]]; which in one and the same matter are
inconsistent.




naturally every [[man]] has [[right]] to everything

and because the condition of [[man]], (as hath been declared in the
precedent chapter) is a condition of warre of every one against every
one; in which case every one is governed by his own [[reason]]; and there
is nothing he can make use of, that may not be a [[help]] unto him, in
preserving his [[life]] against his enemyes; it followeth, that in such a
condition, every [[man]] has a [[right]] to every thing; even to one anothers
body. and therefore, as long as this naturall [[right]] of every [[man]] to
every thing endureth, there can be no security to any [[man]], (how strong
or [[wise]] soever he be,) of living out the [[time]], which [[nature]] ordinarily
alloweth [[men]] to [[live]].




the fundamental [[law]] of nature

and consequently it is a precept, or generall [[rule]] of [[reason]], "that
every [[man]], ought to endeavour [[peace]], as farre as he has [[hope]] of
obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use,
all helps, and advantages of warre." the first branch, of which [[rule]],
containeth the first, and fundamentall [[law]] of [[nature]]; which is, "to seek
peace, and [[follow]] it." the second, the summe of the [[right]] of [[nature]];
which is, "by all means we can, to defend our selves."




the second [[law]] of nature

from this fundamentall [[law]] of [[nature]], by which [[men]] are commanded to
endeavour [[peace]], is derived this second [[law]]; "that a [[man]] be willing,
when others are so too, as farre-forth, as for [[peace]], and defence of
himselfe he shall [[think]] it necessary, to lay down this [[right]] to all
things; and be contented with so much [[liberty]] against other [[men]], as
he would allow other [[men]] against himselfe." for as long as every man
holdeth this [[right]], of doing any thing he liketh; so long are all [[men]] in
the condition of warre. but if other [[men]] will not lay down their [[right]],
as well as he; then there is no [[reason]] for any one, to devest himselfe
of his: for that were to expose himselfe to prey, (which no [[man]] is bound
to) rather than to dispose himselfe to [[peace]]. this is that [[law]] of the
gospell; "whatsoever you require that others should do to you, that do
ye to them." and that [[law]] of all [[men]], "quod tibi feiri non vis, alteri
ne feceris."




what it is to lay down a right

to lay downe a mans [[man]] [[right]] to any thing, is to devest himselfe of the
liberty, of hindring another of the benefit of his own [[right]] to the
same. for he that renounceth, or passeth away his [[right]], giveth not to
any other [[man]] a [[right]] which he had not before; because there is nothing
to which every [[man]] had not [[right]] by [[nature]]: but onely standeth out of
his way, that he may enjoy his own originall [[right]], without hindrance
from him; not without hindrance from another. so that the effect which
redoundeth to one [[man]], by another mans [[man]] defect of [[right]], is but so much
diminution of impediments to the use of his own [[right]] originall.




renouncing (or) transferring [[right]] what; obligation [[duty]] justice

right is layd aside, either by simply renouncing it; or by transferring
it to another. by simply renouncing; when he cares [[care]] not to whom the
benefit thereof redoundeth. by transferring; when he intendeth the
benefit thereof to some [[certain]] [[person]], or persons [[person]]. and when a [[man]] hath
in either manner abandoned, or granted away his [[right]]; then is he said
to be obliged, or bound, not to hinder those, to whom such [[right]] is
granted, or abandoned, from the benefit of it: and that he ought, and it
his [[duty]], not to make voyd that voluntary act of his own: and that such
hindrance is [[injustice]], and injury, as being sine jure; the [[right]] being
before renounced, or transferred. so that injury, or [[injustice]], in
the controversies of the [[world]], is somewhat like to that, which in the
disputations of scholers is called absurdity. for as it is there called
an absurdity, to contradict what one maintained in the beginning: so in
the [[world]], it is called [[injustice]], and injury, voluntarily to undo that,
which from the beginning he had voluntarily done. the way by which a man
either simply renounceth, or transferreth his [[right]], is a declaration,
or signification, by some voluntary and sufficient signe, or signes,
that he doth so renounce, or transferre; or hath so renounced, or
transferred the same, to him that accepteth it. and these signes are
either words onely, or actions onely; or (as it happeneth most often)
both words and actions. and the same are the bonds, by which [[men]] are
bound, and obliged: bonds, that have their [[strength]], not from their own
nature, (for nothing is more easily broken then a mans [[man]] word,) but from
feare of some evill consequence upon the rupture.




not all rights [[right]] are alienable

whensoever a [[man]] transferreth his [[right]], or renounceth it; it is either
in consideration of some [[right]] reciprocally transferred to himselfe; or
for some other [[good]] he hopeth for thereby. for it is a voluntary act:
and of the voluntary acts of every [[man]], the object is some [[good]] to
himselfe. and therefore there be some rights [[right]], which no [[man]] can be
understood by any words, or other signes, to have abandoned, or
transferred. as first a [[man]] cannot lay down the [[right]] of resisting them,
that assault him by [[force]], to take away his [[life]]; because he cannot be
understood to ayme thereby, at any [[good]] to himselfe. the same may be
sayd of wounds, and chayns, and imprisonment; both because there is
no benefit consequent to such patience; as there is to the patience of
suffering another to be wounded, or imprisoned: as also because a man
cannot tell, when he seeth [[men]] proceed against him by [[violence]], whether
they intend his [[death]] or not. and lastly the motive, and end for which
this renouncing, and transferring or [[right]] is introduced, is nothing
else but the security of a mans [[man]] [[person]], in his [[life]], and in the means of
so preserving [[life]], as not to be weary of it. and therefore if a [[man]] by
words, or other signes, seem to despoyle himselfe of the end, for which
those signes were intended; he is not to be understood as if he meant
it, or that it was his will; but that he was ignorant of how such words
and actions were to be interpreted.




contract what

the mutuall transferring of [[right]], is that which [[men]] call contract.

there is difference, between transferring of [[right]] to the thing; and
transferring, or tradition, that is, delivery of the thing it selfe. for
the thing may be delivered together with the translation of the [[right]];
as in buying and selling with ready mony; or exchange of goods [[good]], or
lands: and it may be delivered some [[time]] after.




covenant what

again, one of the contractors, may deliver the thing contracted for on
his part, and leave the other to perform his part at some determinate
time after, and in the mean [[time]] be trusted; and then the contract on
his part, is called pact, or covenant: or both parts may contract now,
to performe hereafter: in which cases, he that is to performe in time
to come, being trusted, his performance is called keeping of promise, or
faith; and the fayling of performance (if it be voluntary) violation of
faith.




free-gift

when the transferring of [[right]], is not mutuall; but one of the parties
transferreth, in [[hope]] to gain thereby [[friendship]], or service from
another, or from his [[friends]]; or in [[hope]] to gain the [[reputation]] of
charity, or magnanimity; or to deliver his [[mind]] from the [[pain]] of
compassion; or in [[hope]] of [[reward]] in [[heaven]]; this is not contract, but
gift, freegift, grace: which words signifie one and the same thing.




signes of contract expresse

signes of contract, are either expresse, or by inference. expresse, are
words spoken with understanding of what they signifie; and such words
are either of the [[time]] [[present]], or [[past]]; as, i give, i grant, i have
given, i have granted, i will that this be yours: or of the future;
as, i will give, i will grant; which words of the future, are called
promise.




signes of contract by inference

signes by inference, are sometimes the consequence of words; sometimes
the consequence of [[silence]]; sometimes the consequence of actions;
sometimes the consequence of forbearing an action: and generally a signe
by inference, of any contract, is whatsoever sufficiently argues the
will of the contractor.




free gift passeth by words of the [[present]] or past

words alone, if they be of the [[time]] to come, and contain a bare promise,
are an insufficient signe of a free-gift and therefore not obligatory.
for if they be of the [[time]] to come, as, to morrow i will give, they
are a signe i have not given yet, and consequently that my [[right]] is not
transferred, but remaineth till i transferre it by some other act. but
if the words be of the [[time]] [[present]], or [[past]], as, "i have given, or do
give to be delivered to morrow," then is my to morrows [[right]] given away
to day; and that by the vertue of the words, though there were no
other argument of my will. and there is a [[great]] difference in the
signification of these words, volos hoc tuum esse cras, and cros dabo;
that is between "i will that this be thine to morrow," and, "i will
give it to thee to morrow:" for the word i will, in the former manner
of [[speech]], signifies an act of the will [[present]]; but in the later, it
signifies a promise of an act of the will to come: and therefore the
former words, being of the [[present]], transferre a future [[right]]; the
later, that be of the future, transferre nothing. but if there be other
signes of the will to transferre a [[right]], besides words; then, though
the gift be [[free]], yet may the [[right]] be understood to passe by words of
the future: as if a [[man]] propound a prize to him that comes first to the
end of a [[race]], the gift is [[free]]; and though the words be of the
future, yet the [[right]] passeth: for if he would not have his words so be
understood, he should not have let them runne.

signes of contract are words both of the [[past]], [[present]], and future in
contracts, the [[right]] passeth, not onely where the words are of the time
present, or [[past]]; but also where they are of the future; because all
contract is mutuall translation, or [[change]] of [[right]]; and therefore he
that promiseth onely, because he hath already received the benefit for
which he promiseth, is to be understood as if he intended the right
should passe: for unlesse he had been content to have his words so
understood, the other would not have performed his part first. and
for that cause, in buying, and selling, and other acts of contract, a
promise is equivalent to a covenant; and therefore obligatory.




merit what

he that performeth first in the case of a contract, is said to merit
that which he is to receive by the performance of the other; and he hath
it as due. also when a prize is propounded to many, which is to be given
to him onely that winneth; or mony is thrown amongst many, to be enjoyed
by them that catch it; though this be a [[free]] gift; yet so to [[win]], or
so to catch, is to [[merit]], and to have it as due. for the [[right]] is
transferred in the propounding of the prize, and in throwing down the
mony; though it be not determined to whom, but by the event of the
contention. but there is between these two sorts of [[merit]], this
difference, that in contract, i [[merit]] by vertue of my own [[power]], and the
contractors need; but in this case of [[free]] gift, i am enabled to
merit onely by the benignity of the giver; in contract, i [[merit]] at the
contractors hand that hee should depart with his [[right]]; in this case of
gift, i [[merit]] not that the giver should part with his [[right]]; but that
when he has parted with it, it should be mine, rather than anothers.
and this i [[think]] to be the meaning of that distinction of the schooles,
between meritum congrui, and meritum condigni. for [[god]] almighty, having
promised paradise to those [[men]] (hoodwinkt with carnall desires [[desire]],) that
can walk through this [[world]] according to the precepts, and limits
prescribed by him; they say, he that shall so walk, shall [[merit]] paradise
ex congruo. but because no [[man]] can demand a [[right]] to it, by his own
righteousnesse, or any other [[power]] in himselfe, but by the [[free]] grace of
god onely; they say, no [[man]] can [[merit]] paradise ex condigno. this i say,
i [[think]] is the meaning of that distinction; but because disputers do not
agree upon the signification of their own termes of art [[arts]], longer than it
serves their turn; i will not affirme any thing of their meaning:
onely this i say; when a gift is given indefinitely, as a prize to be
contended for, he that winneth meriteth, and may claime the prize as
due.




covenants of mutuall trust, when invalid

if a covenant be made, wherein neither of the parties performe
presently, but trust one another; in the condition of meer [[nature]],
(which is a condition of warre of every [[man]] against every [[man]],) upon
any reasonable suspition, it is voyd; but if there be a [[common]] [[power]] set
over them bothe, with [[right]] and [[force]] sufficient to compell performance;
it is not voyd. for he that performeth first, has no assurance the other
will performe after; because the bonds of words are too [[weak]] to bridle
mens [[ambition]], avarice, anger, and other [[passions]], without the feare of
some coerceive [[power]]; which in the condition of meer [[nature]], where all
men are equall, and judges [[judge]] of the justnesse of their own fears [[fear]] cannot
possibly be supposed. and therefore he which performeth first, does
but betray himselfe to his [[enemy]]; contrary to the [[right]] (he can never
abandon) of defending his [[life]], and means of living.

but in a civill estate, where there is a [[power]] set up to constrain
those that would otherwise violate their [[faith]], that feare is no more
reasonable; and for that cause, he which by the covenant is to perform
first, is obliged so to do.

the cause of feare, which maketh such a covenant invalid, must be
alwayes something arising after the covenant made; as some new [[fact]],
or other signe of the will not to performe; else it cannot make the
covenant voyd. for that which could not hinder a [[man]] from promising,
ought not to be admitted as a hindrance of performing.




right to the end, containeth [[right]] to the means

he that transferreth any [[right]], transferreth the means of enjoying it,
as farre as lyeth in his [[power]]. as he that selleth [[land]], is understood
to transferre the herbage, and whatsoever growes upon it; nor can he
that sells a mill turn away the stream that drives it. and they that
give to a [[man]] the [[right]] of [[government]] in soveraignty, are understood
to give him the [[right]] of levying mony to maintain souldiers; and of
appointing magistrates for the administration of [[justice]].




no covenant with beasts

to make covenant with bruit beasts, is impossible; because not
understanding our [[speech]], they [[understand]] not, nor accept of any
translation of [[right]]; nor can translate any [[right]] to another; and
without mutuall acceptation, there is no covenant.




nor with [[god]] without speciall revelation

to make covenant with [[god]], is impossible, but by mediation of such
as [[god]] speaketh to, either by revelation supernaturall, or by his
lieutenants that govern under him, and in his name; for otherwise we
know not whether our covenants be accepted, or not. and therefore they
that vow any thing contrary to any [[law]] of [[nature]], vow in [[vain]]; as being
a thing [[unjust]] to [[pay]] such vow. and if it be a thing commanded by the
law of [[nature]], it is not the vow, but the [[law]] that binds them.




no covenant, but of possible and future

the matter, or [[subject]] of a covenant, is alwayes something that falleth
under deliberation; (for to covenant, is an act of the will; that is to
say an act, and the [[last]] act, of deliberation;) and is therefore alwayes
understood to be something to come; and which is judged possible for him
that covenanteth, to performe.

and therefore, to promise that which is known to be impossible, is no
covenant. but if that prove impossible afterwards, which before was
thought possible, the covenant is valid, and bindeth, (though not to the
thing it selfe,) yet to the value; or, if that also be impossible, to
the unfeigned endeavour of performing as much as is possible; for to
more no [[man]] can be obliged.




covenants how made voyd

men are freed of their covenants two wayes; by performing; or by being
forgiven. for performance, is the naturall end of obligation; and
forgivenesse, the restitution of [[liberty]]; as being a retransferring of
that [[right]], in which the obligation consisted.




covenants extorted by feare are valide

covenants entred into by [[fear]], in the condition of meer [[nature]], are
obligatory. for [[example]], if i covenant to [[pay]] a ransome, or service for
my [[life]], to an [[enemy]]; i am bound by it. for it is a contract, wherein
one receiveth the benefit of [[life]]; the other is to receive mony,
or service for it; and consequently, where no other [[law]] (as in the
condition, of meer nature) forbiddeth the performance, the covenant
is valid. therefore prisoners [[prisoner]] of warre, if trusted with the payment of
their ransome, are obliged to [[pay]] it; and if a weaker [[prince]], make a
disadvantageous [[peace]] with a stronger, for feare; he is bound to keep
it; unlesse (as hath been sayd before) there ariseth some new, and just
cause of feare, to renew the [[war]]. and even in common-wealths, if i be
forced to redeem my selfe from a theefe by promising him mony, i am
bound to [[pay]] it, till the civill [[law]] discharge me. for whatsoever i may
lawfully do without obligation, the same i may lawfully covenant to do
through feare: and what i lawfully covenant, i cannot lawfully break.




the former covenant to one, makes voyd the later to another

a former covenant, makes voyd a later. for a [[man]] that hath passed away
his [[right]] to one [[man]] to day, hath it not to passe to morrow to another:
and therefore the later promise passeth no [[right]], but is null.




a mans [[man]] covenant not to defend himselfe, is voyd

a covenant not to defend my selfe from [[force]], by [[force]], is alwayes voyd.
for (as i have shewed before) no [[man]] can transferre, or lay down his
right to save himselfe from [[death]], wounds, and imprisonment, (the
avoyding whereof is the onely end of laying down any [[right]],)
and therefore the promise of not resisting [[force]], in no covenant
transferreth any [[right]]; nor is obliging. for though a [[man]] may covenant
thus, "unlesse i do so, or so, kill me;" he cannot covenant thus "unless
i do so, or so, i will not resist you, when you come to kill me." for
man by [[nature]] chooseth the lesser evill, which is danger of [[death]] in
resisting; rather than the greater, which is [[certain]] and [[present]] death
in not resisting. and this is granted to be true by all [[men]], in
that they lead criminals [[criminal]] to execution, and prison, with armed [[men]],
notwithstanding that such criminals [[criminal]] have consented to the [[law]], by which
they are condemned.




no [[man]] obliged to accuse himselfe

a covenant to accuse ones selfe, without assurance of pardon, is
likewise invalide. for in the condition of [[nature]], where every [[man]] is
judge, there is no place for accusation: and in the civill [[state]], the
accusation is followed with [[punishment]]; which being [[force]], a [[man]] is
not obliged not to resist. the same is also true, of the accusation of
those, by whose condemnation a [[man]] falls into misery; as of a [[father]],
wife, or benefactor. for the testimony of such an accuser, if it be not
willingly given, is praesumed to be corrupted by [[nature]]; and therefore
not to be received: and where a mans [[man]] testimony is not to be credited,
his not bound to give it. also accusations upon torture, are not to
be reputed as testimonies. for torture is to be used but as means of
conjecture, and [[light]], in the further examination, and search of [[truth]];
and what is in that case confessed, tendeth to the ease of him that is
tortured; not to the informing of the torturers: and therefore ought
not to have the credit of a sufficient testimony: for whether he deliver
himselfe by true, or false accusation, he does it by the [[right]] of
preserving his own [[life]].




the end of an oath; the forme of as oath

the [[force]] of words, being (as i have formerly noted) too [[weak]] to hold
men to the performance of their covenants; there are in mans [[man]] [[nature]], but
two imaginable helps to strengthen it. and those are either a feare
of the consequence of breaking their word; or a [[glory]], or [[pride]] in
appearing not to need to breake it. this later is a generosity too
rarely found to be presumed on, especially in the pursuers of [[wealth]],
command, or sensuall [[pleasure]]; which are the [[greatest]] part of [[mankind]].
the passion to be reckoned upon, is [[fear]]; whereof there be two very
generall objects: one, the [[power]] of spirits invisible; the other, the
power of those [[men]] they shall therein offend. of these two, though the
former be the greater [[power]], yet the feare of the later is commonly
the greater feare. the feare of the former is in every [[man]], his own
religion: which hath place in the [[nature]] of [[man]] before civill [[society]].
the later hath not so; at least not place enough, to keep [[men]] to their
promises; because in the condition of meer [[nature]], the inequality of
power is not discerned, but by the event of battell. so that before the
time of civill [[society]], or in the interruption thereof by warre, there
is nothing can strengthen a covenant of [[peace]] agreed on, against the
temptations of avarice, [[ambition]], [[lust]], or other [[strong]] [[desire]], but the
feare of that invisible [[power]], which they every one [[worship]] as [[god]]; and
feare as a revenger of their perfidy. all therefore that can be done
between two [[men]] not [[subject]] to civill [[power]], is to put one another
to swear by the [[god]] he feareth: which swearing or oath, is a forme of
speech, added to a promise; by which he that promiseth, signifieth, that
unlesse he performe, he renounceth the [[mercy]] of his [[god]], or calleth to
him for vengeance on himselfe. such was the heathen forme, "let jupiter
kill me else, as i kill this beast." so is our forme, "i shall do thus,
and thus, so [[help]] me [[god]]." and this, with the rites and ceremonies [[ceremony]],
which every one useth in his own [[religion]], that the feare of breaking
faith might be the greater.




no oath, but by god

by this it appears, that an oath taken according to any other forme, or
rite, then his, that sweareth, is in [[vain]]; and no oath: and there is no
swearing by any thing which the swearer thinks [[think]] not [[god]]. for though men
have sometimes used to swear by their kings [[king]], for feare, or [[flattery]]; yet
they would have it thereby understood, they attributed to them divine
honour. and that swearing unnecessarily by [[god]], is but prophaning of his
name: and swearing by other things, as [[men]] do in [[common]] discourse, is
not swearing, but an impious custome, gotten by too much vehemence of
talking.




an oath addes nothing to the obligation

it appears also, that the oath addes nothing to the obligation. for a
covenant, if lawfull, binds in the sight of [[god]], without the oath,
as much as with it; if unlawfull, bindeth not at all; though it be
confirmed with an oath.



chapter xv. of other lawes of nature




the third [[law]] of [[nature]], justice

from that [[law]] of [[nature]], by which we are obliged to transferre to
another, such rights [[right]], as being retained, hinder the [[peace]] of [[mankind]],
there followeth a third; which is this, that [[men]] performe their
covenants made: without which, covenants are in [[vain]], and but empty
words; and the [[right]] of all [[men]] to all things remaining, wee are still
in the condition of warre.




justice and [[injustice]] what

and in this [[law]] of [[nature]], consisteth the fountain and originall of
justice. for where no covenant hath preceded, there hath no [[right]] been
transferred, and every [[man]] has [[right]] to every thing; and consequently,
no action can be [[unjust]]. but when a covenant is made, then to break it
is [[unjust]]: and the definition of [[injustice]], is no other than the not
performance of covenant. and whatsoever is not [[unjust]], is just.

justice and propriety begin with the [[constitution]] of common-wealth
but because covenants of mutuall trust, where there is a feare of not
performance on either part, (as hath been said in the former [[chapter]],)
are invalid; though the originall of [[justice]] be the making of covenants;
yet [[injustice]] actually there can be none, till the cause of such feare
be taken away; which while [[men]] are in the naturall condition of warre,
cannot be done. therefore before the names of just, and [[unjust]] can have
place, there must be some coercive [[power]], to compell [[men]] equally to
the performance of their covenants, by the terrour of some [[punishment]],
greater than the benefit they expect by the breach of their covenant;
and to make [[good]] that propriety, which by mutuall contract [[men]] acquire,
in recompence of the universall [[right]] they abandon: and such [[power]] there
is none before the erection of a common-wealth. and this is also to be
gathered out of the ordinary definition of [[justice]] in the schooles: for
they say, that "justice is the constant will of giving to every [[man]] his
own." and therefore where there is no own, that is, no propriety, there
is no [[injustice]]; and where there is no coerceive [[power]] erected, that is,
where there is no common-wealth, there is no propriety; all [[men]] having
right to all things: therefore where there is no common-wealth, there
nothing is [[unjust]]. so that the [[nature]] of [[justice]], consisteth in keeping
of valid covenants: but the validity of covenants begins not but with
the [[constitution]] of a civill [[power]], sufficient to compell [[men]] to keep
them: and then it is also that propriety begins.




justice not contrary to reason

the foole hath sayd in his [[heart]], there is no such thing as [[justice]];
and sometimes also with his tongue; seriously alleaging, that every mans
conservation, and contentment, being committed to his own [[care]], there
could be no [[reason]], why every [[man]] might not do what he [[thought]] conduced
thereunto; and therefore also to make, or not make; keep, or not keep
covenants, was not against [[reason]], when it conduced to ones benefit.
he does not therein deny, that there be covenants; and that they are
sometimes broken, sometimes kept; and that such breach of them may
be called [[injustice]], and the observance of them [[justice]]: but he
questioneth, whether [[injustice]], taking away the feare of [[god]], (for the
same foole hath said in his [[heart]] there is no [[god]],) may not sometimes
stand with that [[reason]], which dictateth to every [[man]] his own [[good]]; and
particularly then, when it conduceth to such a benefit, as shall put a
man in a condition, to neglect not onely the dispraise, and revilings,
but also the [[power]] of other [[men]]. the kingdome of [[god]] is gotten by
violence; but what if it could be gotten by [[unjust]] [[violence]]? were it
against [[reason]] so to get it, when it is impossible to receive hurt by
it? and if it be not against [[reason]], it is not against [[justice]]; or else
justice is not to be approved for [[good]]. from such reasoning as this,
succesfull wickednesse hath obtained the name of vertue; and some that
in all other things have disallowed the violation of [[faith]]; yet have
allowed it, when it is for the getting of a kingdome. and the heathen
that believed, that saturn was deposed by his [[son]] [[jupiter]], believed
neverthelesse the same [[jupiter]] to be the avenger of [[injustice]]: somewhat
like to a piece of [[law]] in cokes commentaries on litleton; where he
sayes, if the [[right]] heire of the [[crown]] be attainted of [[treason]]; yet the
crown shall descend to him, and eo instante the atteynder be voyd; from
which instances a [[man]] will be very prone to inferre; that when the heire
apparent of a kingdome, shall kill him that is in possession, though his
father; you may call it [[injustice]], or by what other name you will; yet
it can never be against [[reason]], seeing all the voluntary actions of
men tend to the benefit of themselves; and those actions are most
reasonable, that conduce most to their ends. this specious reasoning is
nevertheless false.

for the [[question]] is not of promises mutuall, where there is no security
of performance on either side; as when there is no civill [[power]] erected
over the parties promising; for such promises are no covenants: but
either where one of the parties has performed already; or where there
is a [[power]] to make him performe; there is the [[question]] whether it be
against [[reason]], that is, against the benefit of the other to performe,
or not. and i say it is not against [[reason]]. for the manifestation
whereof, we are to consider; first, that when a [[man]] doth a thing, which
notwithstanding any thing can be foreseen, and reckoned on, tendeth to
his own destruction, howsoever some accident which he could not expect,
arriving may turne it to his benefit; yet such events do not make it
reasonably or wisely done. secondly, that in a condition of warre,
wherein every [[man]] to every [[man]], for want of a [[common]] [[power]] to keep them
all in awe, is an [[enemy]], there is no [[man]] can [[hope]] by his own [[strength]],
or wit, to defend himselfe from destruction, without the help
of confederates; where every one expects the same defence by the
confederation, that any one else does: and therefore he which declares
he thinks [[think]] it [[reason]] to [[deceive]] those that [[help]] him, can in [[reason]] expect
no other means of safety, than what can be had from his own single
power. he therefore that breaketh his covenant, and consequently
declareth that he thinks [[think]] he may with [[reason]] do so, cannot be received
into any [[society]], that unite themselves for [[peace]] and defence, but
by the errour of them that receive him; nor when he is received, be
retayned in it, without seeing the danger of their errour; which errours
a [[man]] cannot reasonably reckon upon as the means of his security; and
therefore if he be left, or cast out of [[society]], he perisheth; and if he
live in [[society]], it is by the errours of other [[men]], which he could not
foresee, nor reckon upon; and consequently against the [[reason]] of his
preservation; and so, as all [[men]] that contribute not to his destruction,
forbear him onely out of ignorance of what is [[good]] for themselves.

as for the instance of gaining the secure and perpetuall felicity of
heaven, by any way; it is frivolous: there being but one way imaginable;
and that is not breaking, but keeping of covenant.

and for the other instance of attaining soveraignty by rebellion; it is
manifest, that though the event [[follow]], yet because it cannot reasonably
be expected, but rather the contrary; and because by gaining it so,
others are taught to gain the same in like manner, the attempt thereof
is against [[reason]]. [[justice]] therefore, that is to say, keeping of
covenant, is a [[rule]] of [[reason]], by which we are forbidden to do any thing
destructive to our [[life]]; and consequently a [[law]] of [[nature]].

there be some that proceed further; and will not have the [[law]] of [[nature]],
to be those rules [[rule]] which conduce to the preservation of mans [[man]] [[life]] on
earth; but to the attaining of an eternall felicity after [[death]]; to
which they [[think]] the breach of covenant may conduce; and consequently
be just and reasonable; (such are they that [[think]] it a [[work]] of merit
to kill, or depose, or rebell against, the soveraigne [[power]] constituted
over them by their own [[consent]].) but because there is no naturall
knowledge of mans [[man]] estate after [[death]]; much lesse of the [[reward]] that is
then to be given to breach of [[faith]]; but onely a beliefe grounded upon
other mens [[men]] saying, that they [[know]] it supernaturally, or that they know
those, that knew them, that knew others, that knew it supernaturally;
breach of [[faith]] cannot be called a precept of [[reason]], or [[nature]].




covenants not discharged by the [[vice]] of the [[person]] to whom made

others, that allow for a [[law]] of [[nature]], the keeping of [[faith]], do
neverthelesse make exception of [[certain]] persons [[person]]; as heretiques, and
such as use not to performe their covenant to others: and this also is
against [[reason]]. for if any [[fault]] of a [[man]], be sufficient to discharge
our covenant made; the same ought in [[reason]] to have been sufficient to
have hindred the making of it.




justice of [[men]], and [[justice]] of actions what

the names of just, and [[unjust]], when they are attributed to [[men]], signifie
one thing; and when they are attributed to actions, another. when they
are attributed to [[men]], they signifie conformity, or inconformity of
manners, to [[reason]]. but when they are attributed to actions, they
signifie the conformity, or inconformity to [[reason]], not of manners, or
manner of [[life]], but of particular actions. a just [[man]] therefore, is he
that taketh all the [[care]] he can, that his actions may be all just: and
an [[unjust]] [[man]], is he that neglecteth it. and such [[men]] are more often
in our [[language]] stiled by the names of righteous, and unrighteous; then
just, and [[unjust]]; though the meaning be the same. therefore a righteous
man, does not lose that title, by one, or a few [[unjust]] actions, that
proceed from sudden passion, or mistake of things, or persons [[person]]: nor does
an unrighteous [[man]], lose his [[character]], for such actions, as he does,
of forbeares to do, for feare: because his will is not framed by the
justice, but by the apparant benefit of what he is to do. that which
gives to humane actions the relish of [[justice]], is a [[certain]] noblenesse
or gallantnesse of [[courage]], (rarely found,) by which a [[man]] scorns to
be beholding for the contentment of his [[life]], to fraud, or breach of
promise. this [[justice]] of the manners, is that which is meant, where
justice is called a vertue; and [[injustice]] a [[vice]].

but the [[justice]] of actions denominates [[men]], not just, but guiltlesse;
and the [[injustice]] of the same, (which is also called injury,) gives them
but the name of guilty.




justice of manners, and [[justice]] of actions

again, the [[injustice]] of manners, is the disposition, or aptitude to
do injurie; and is [[injustice]] before it proceed to act; and without
supposing any individuall [[person]] injured. but the [[injustice]] of an
action, (that is to say injury,) supposeth an individuall person
injured; namely him, to whom the covenant was made: and therefore many
times the injury is received by one [[man]], when the dammage redoundeth
to another. as when the master commandeth his servant to give mony to a
stranger; if it be not done, the injury is done to the master, whom
he had before covenanted to obey; but the dammage redoundeth to the
stranger, to whom he had no obligation; and therefore could not injure
him. and so also in common-wealths, private [[men]] may remit to one another
their debts; but not robberies or other violences, whereby they are
endammaged; because the detaining of debt, is an injury to themselves;
but robbery and [[violence]], are injuries to the [[person]] of the
common-wealth.




nothing done to a [[man]], by his own [[consent]] can be injury

whatsoever is done to a [[man]], conformable to his own will signified to
the doer, is no injury to him. for if he that doeth it, hath not passed
away his originall [[right]] to do what he please, by some antecedent
covenant, there is no breach of covenant; and therefore no injury done
him. and if he have; then his will to have it done being signified, is a
release of that covenant; and so again there is no injury done him.




justice commutative, and distributive

justice of actions, is by writers divided into commutative, and
distributive; and the former they say consisteth in proportion
arithmeticall; the later in proportion geometricall. commutative
therefore, they place in the equality of value of the things contracted
for; and distributive, in the distribution of equall benefit, to [[men]] of
equall [[merit]]. as if it were [[injustice]] to sell dearer than we buy; or to
give more to a [[man]] than he merits [[merit]]. the value of all things contracted
for, is measured by the appetite of the contractors: and therefore the
just value, is that which they be contented to give. and [[merit]] (besides
that which is by covenant, where the performance on one part, meriteth
the performance of the other part, and falls under [[justice]] commutative,
not distributive,) is not due by [[justice]]; but is rewarded of grace
onely. and therefore this distinction, in the sense wherein it useth to
be expounded, is not [[right]]. to speak properly, commutative [[justice]],
is the [[justice]] of a contractor; that is, a performance of covenant,
in buying, and selling; hiring, and letting to hire; lending, and
borrowing; exchanging, bartering, and other acts of contract.

and distributive [[justice]], the [[justice]] of an arbitrator; that is to say,
the act of defining what is just. wherein, (being trusted by them that
make him arbitrator,) if he performe his trust, he is said to distribute
to every [[man]] his own: and his is indeed just distribution, and may
be called (though improperly) distributive [[justice]]; but more properly
equity; which also is a [[law]] of [[nature]], as shall be shewn in due place.




the fourth [[law]] of [[nature]], gratitude

as [[justice]] dependeth on antecedent covenant; so does gratitude depend
on antecedent grace; that is to say, antecedent free-gift: and is the
fourth [[law]] of [[nature]]; which may be conceived in this forme, "that a man
which receiveth benefit from another of meer grace, endeavour that he
which giveth it, have no reasonable cause to repent him of his good
will." for no [[man]] giveth, but with intention of [[good]] to himselfe;
because gift is voluntary; and of all voluntary acts, the object is to
every [[man]] his own [[good]]; of which if [[men]] see they shall be frustrated,
there will be no beginning of benevolence, or trust; nor consequently of
mutuall [[help]]; nor of reconciliation of one [[man]] to another; and therefore
they are to remain still in the condition of [[war]]; which is contrary to
the first and fundamentall [[law]] of [[nature]], which commandeth [[men]] to seek
peace. the breach of this [[law]], is called ingratitude; and hath the same
relation to grace, that [[injustice]] hath to obligation by covenant.




the fifth, mutuall accommodation, or compleasance

a fifth [[law]] of [[nature]], is compleasance; that is to say, "that every
man strive to accommodate himselfe to the rest." for the understanding
whereof, we may consider, that there is in mens [[men]] aptnesse to [[society]];
a [[diversity]] of [[nature]], rising from their [[diversity]] of affections; not
unlike to that we see in stones brought together for building of an
aedifice. for as that stone which by the asperity, and irregularity of
figure, takes more room from others, than it selfe fills; and for
the hardnesse, cannot be easily made plain, and thereby hindereth the
building, is by the builders cast away as unprofitable, and troublesome:
so also, a [[man]] that by asperity of [[nature]], will strive to retain those
things which to himselfe are superfluous, and to others necessary; and
for the stubbornness of his [[passions]], cannot be corrected, is to be
left, or cast out of [[society]], as combersome thereunto. for seeing every
man, not onely by [[right]], but also by necessity of [[nature]], is supposed
to endeavour all he can, to obtain that which is necessary for his
conservation; he that shall oppose himselfe against it, for things
superfluous, is guilty of the warre that thereupon is to [[follow]]; and
therefore doth that, which is contrary to the fundamentall [[law]] of
nature, which commandeth to seek [[peace]]. the observers of this [[law]],
may be called sociable, (the latines call them commodi;) the contrary,
stubborn, insociable, froward, intractable.




the sixth, facility to pardon

a sixth [[law]] of [[nature]] is this, "that upon caution of the future [[time]],
a [[man]] ought to pardon the offences [[past]] of them that repenting, desire
it." for pardon, is nothing but granting of [[peace]]; which though granted
to them that persevere in their hostility, be not [[peace]], but feare; yet
not granted to them that give caution of the future [[time]], is signe of an
aversion to [[peace]]; and therefore contrary to the [[law]] of [[nature]].




the seventh, that in revenges, [[men]] [[respect]] onely the future good

a seventh is, " that in revenges, (that is, retribution of [[evil]] for
evil,) [[men]] look not at the greatnesse of the evill [[past]], but the
greatnesse of the [[good]] to [[follow]]." whereby we are forbidden to inflict
punishment with any other designe, than for correction of the offender,
or direction of others. for this [[law]] is consequent to the next before
it, that commandeth pardon, upon security of the future [[time]]. besides,
revenge without [[respect]] to the [[example]], and [[profit]] to come, is a
triumph, or glorying in the hurt of another, tending to no end; (for the
end is alwayes somewhat to come;) and glorying to no end, is vain-glory,
and contrary to [[reason]]; and to hurt without [[reason]], tendeth to the
introduction of warre; which is against the [[law]] of [[nature]]; and is
commonly stiled by the name of [[cruelty]].




the eighth, against contumely

and because all signes of [[hatred]], or contempt, provoke to [[fight]];
insomuch as most [[men]] choose rather to hazard their [[life]], than not to be
revenged; we may in the eighth place, for a [[law]] of [[nature]] set down this
precept, "that no [[man]] by deed, word, countenance, or gesture, declare
hatred, or contempt of another." the breach of which [[law]], is commonly
called contumely.




the ninth, against pride

the [[question]] who is the [[better]] [[man]], has no place in the condition of
meer [[nature]]; where, (as has been shewn before,) all [[men]] are equall. the
inequallity that now is, has been introduced by the lawes civill. i know
that [[aristotle]] in the first booke of his politiques, for a foundation of
his doctrine, maketh [[men]] by [[nature]], some more worthy to command, meaning
the wiser sort (such as he [[thought]] himselfe to be for his [[philosophy]];)
others to serve, (meaning those that had [[strong]] bodies [[body]], but were not
philosophers as he;) as if master and servant were not introduced by
consent of [[men]], but by difference of wit; which is not only against
reason; but also against [[experience]]. for there are very few so foolish,
that had not rather governe themselves, than be governed by others:
nor when the [[wise]] in their own conceit, contend by [[force]], with them who
distrust their owne wisdome, do they alwaies, or often, or almost at any
time, get the [[victory]]. if [[nature]] therefore have made [[men]] equall, that
equalitie is to be acknowledged; or if [[nature]] have made [[men]] unequall;
yet because [[men]] that [[think]] themselves equall, will not enter into
conditions of [[peace]], but upon equall termes, such equalitie must be
admitted. and therefore for the ninth [[law]] of [[nature]], i put this, "that
every [[man]] acknowledge other for his equall by [[nature]]." the breach of
this precept is [[pride]].




the tenth against arrogance

on this [[law]], dependeth another, "that at the entrance into conditions of
peace, no [[man]] require to reserve to himselfe any [[right]], which he is not
content should be reserved to every one of the rest." as it is necessary
for all [[men]] that seek [[peace]], to lay down certaine rights [[right]] of [[nature]]; that
is to say, not to have libertie to do all they list: so is it necessarie
for mans [[man]] [[life]], to retaine some; as [[right]] to governe their owne bodies [[body]];
enjoy aire, water, motion, waies to go from place to place; and all
things else without which a [[man]] cannot [[live]], or not [[live]] well. if in
this case, at the making of [[peace]], [[men]] require for themselves, that
which they would not have to be granted to others, they do contrary
to the precedent [[law]], that commandeth the acknowledgement of naturall
equalitie, and therefore also against the [[law]] of [[nature]]. the observers
of this [[law]], are those we call modest, and the breakers arrogant [[men]].
the greeks [[greek]] call the violation of this [[law]] pleonexia; that is, a desire
of more than their share.




the eleventh equity

also "if a [[man]] be trusted to [[judge]] between [[man]] and [[man]]," it is a precept
of the [[law]] of [[nature]], "that he deale equally between them." for without
that, the controversies of [[men]] cannot be determined but by warre.
he therefore that is partiall in [[judgment]], doth what in him lies [[lie]], to
deterre [[men]] from the use of judges [[judge]], and arbitrators; and consequently,
(against the fundamentall lawe of nature) is the cause of warre.

the observance of this [[law]], from the equall distribution to each [[man]], of
that which in [[reason]] belongeth to him, is called equity, and (as i have
sayd before) distributive [[justice]]: the violation, acception of persons [[person]],
prosopolepsia.




the twelfth, equall use of things common

and from this followeth another [[law]], "that such things as cannot be
divided, be enjoyed in [[common]], if it can be; and if the quantity of the
thing permit, without stint; otherwise proportionably to the number of
them that have [[right]]." for otherwise the distribution is unequall, and
contrary to equitie.




the thirteenth, of lot

but some things there be, that can neither be divided, nor enjoyed in
common. then, the [[law]] of [[nature]], which prescribeth equity, requireth,
"that the entire [[right]]; or else, (making the use alternate,) the first
possession, be determined by lot." for equall distribution, is of
the [[law]] of [[nature]]; and other means of equall distribution cannot be
imagined.




the fourteenth, of primogeniture, and first seising

of lots there be two sorts, arbitrary, and naturall. arbitrary, is
that which is agreed on by the competitors; naturall, is either
primogeniture, (which the [[greek]] calls kleronomia, which signifies, given
by lot;) or first seisure.

and therefore those things which cannot be enjoyed in [[common]], nor
divided, ought to be adjudged to the first possessor; and is some cases
to the first-borne, as acquired by lot.




the fifteenth, of mediators

it is also a [[law]] of [[nature]], "that all [[men]] that mediate [[peace]], be allowed
safe conduct." for the [[law]] that commandeth [[peace]], as the end, commandeth
intercession, as the means; and to intercession the means is safe
conduct.




the sixteenth, of submission to arbitrement

and because, though [[men]] be never so willing to observe these lawes,
there may neverthelesse arise questions [[question]] concerning a mans [[man]] action; first,
whether it were done, or not done; secondly (if done) whether against
the [[law]], or not against the [[law]]; the former whereof, is called a
question of [[fact]]; the later a [[question]] of [[right]]; therefore unlesse the
parties to the [[question]], covenant mutually to stand to the sentence
of another, they are as farre from [[peace]] as ever. this other, to whose
sentence they submit, is called an arbitrator. and therefore it is of
the [[law]] of [[nature]], "that they that are at controversie, submit their
right to the judgement of an arbitrator."




the seventeenth, no [[man]] is his own judge

and seeing every [[man]] is presumed to do all things in order to his own
benefit, no [[man]] is a fit arbitrator in his own cause: and if he were
never so fit; yet equity allowing to each party equall benefit, if one
be admitted to be [[judge]], the other is to be admitted also; & so the
controversie, that is, the cause of [[war]], remains, against the [[law]] of
nature.




the eighteenth, no [[man]] to be [[judge]], that has in him cause of partiality

for the same [[reason]] no [[man]] in any cause ought to be received for
arbitrator, to whom greater [[profit]], or [[honour]], or [[pleasure]] apparently
ariseth out of the [[victory]] of one party, than of the other: for he hath
taken (though an unavoydable bribe, yet) a bribe; and no [[man]] can be
obliged to trust him. and thus also the controversie, and the condition
of [[war]] remaineth, contrary to the [[law]] of [[nature]].




the nineteenth, of witnesse

and in a controversie of [[fact]], the [[judge]] being to give no more credit
to one, than to the other, (if there be no other arguments) must give
credit to a third; or to a third and fourth; or more: for else the
question is undecided, and left to [[force]], contrary to the [[law]] of [[nature]].

these are the lawes of [[nature]], dictating [[peace]], for a means of the
conservation of [[men]] in multitudes; and which onely concern the doctrine
of civill [[society]]. there be other things tending to the destruction of
particular [[men]]; as drunkenness, and all other parts of intemperance;
which may therefore also be reckoned amongst those things which the law
of [[nature]] hath forbidden; but are not necessary to be mentioned, nor are
pertinent enough to this place.




a [[rule]], by which the laws [[law]] of [[nature]] may easily be examined

and though this may seem too subtile a deduction of the lawes of [[nature]],
to be taken notice of by all [[men]]; whereof the most part are too busie in
getting food, and the rest too negligent to [[understand]]; yet to leave
all [[men]] unexcusable, they have been contracted into one easie sum,
intelligible even to the meanest capacity; and that is, "do not that to
another, which thou wouldest not have done to thy selfe;" which sheweth
him, that he has no more to do in learning the lawes of [[nature]], but,
when weighing the actions of other [[men]] with his own, they seem too
heavy, to put them into the other part of the ballance, and his own into
their place, that his own [[passions]], and selfe-love, may adde nothing to
the weight; and then there is none of these lawes of [[nature]] that will
not appear unto him very reasonable.




the lawes of [[nature]] oblige in [[conscience]] alwayes,

but in effect then onely when there is security the lawes of nature
oblige in foro interno; that is to say, they bind to a [[desire]] they
should take place: but in foro externo; that is, to the putting them
in act, not alwayes. for he that should be modest, and tractable, and
performe all he promises, in such [[time]], and place, where no [[man]] els
should do so, should but make himselfe a prey to others, and procure his
own [[certain]] ruine, contrary to the ground of all lawes of [[nature]], which
tend to natures [[nature]] preservation. and again, he that shall observe the same
lawes towards him, observes them not himselfe, seeketh not [[peace]], but
war; & consequently the destruction of his [[nature]] by [[violence]].

and whatsoever lawes bind in foro interno, may be broken, not onely by
a [[fact]] contrary to the [[law]] but also by a [[fact]] according to it, in case a
man [[think]] it contrary. for though his action in this case, be according
to the [[law]]; which where the obligation is in foro interno, is a breach.




the laws [[law]] of [[nature]] are eternal;

the lawes of [[nature]] are immutable and eternall, for [[injustice]],
ingratitude, arrogance, [[pride]], [[iniquity]], acception of persons [[person]], and the
rest, can never be made lawfull. for it can never be that warre shall
preserve [[life]], and [[peace]] [[destroy]] it.




and yet easie

the same lawes, because they oblige onely to a [[desire]], and endeavour, i
mean an unfeigned and constant endeavour, are easie to be observed. for
in that they require nothing but endeavour; he that endeavoureth their
performance, fulfilleth them; and he that fulfilleth the [[law]], is just.




the [[science]] of these lawes, is the true morall philosophy

and the [[science]] of them, is the true and onely [[moral]] [[philosophy]]. for
morall [[philosophy]] is nothing else but the [[science]] of what is [[good]], and
evill, in the conversation, and [[society]] of [[mankind]]. [[good]], and evill,
are names that signifie our appetites, and aversions; which in different
tempers, customes, and doctrines of [[men]], are different: and divers [[men]],
differ not onely in their judgement, on the senses of what is pleasant,
and unpleasant to the tast, smell, hearing, touch, and sight; but also
of what is conformable, or disagreeable to [[reason]], in the actions of
common [[life]]. nay, the same [[man]], in divers times [[time]], differs from himselfe;
and one [[time]] praiseth, that is, calleth [[good]], what another time
he dispraiseth, and calleth [[evil]]: from whence arise disputes,
controversies, and at [[last]] [[war]]. and therefore so long as [[man]] is in the
condition of meer [[nature]], (which is a condition of [[war]],) as private
appetite is the measure of [[good]], and evill: and consequently all men
agree on this, that [[peace]] is [[good]], and therefore also the way, or
means of [[peace]], which (as i have shewed before) are [[justice]], gratitude,
modesty, equity, [[mercy]], & the rest of the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], are [[good]]; that
is to say, morall vertues; and their contrarie vices [[vice]], evill. now the
science of vertue and [[vice]], is morall philosophie; and therfore the true
doctrine of the lawes of [[nature]], is the true morall philosophie. but the
writers of morall philosophie, though they acknowledge the same vertues
and vices [[vice]]; yet not seeing wherein consisted their goodnesse; nor that
they come to be praised, as the meanes of peaceable, sociable, and
comfortable living; place them in a mediocrity of [[passions]]: as if not
the cause, but the [[degree]] of daring, made fortitude; or not the cause,
but the quantity of a gift, made liberality.

these dictates of [[reason]], [[men]] use to call by the name of lawes; but
improperly: for they are but conclusions, or theoremes concerning what
conduceth to the conservation and defence of themselves; whereas [[law]],
properly is the word of him, that by [[right]] hath command over others. but
yet if we consider the same theoremes, as delivered in the word of
god, that by [[right]] commandeth all things; then are they properly called
lawes.



chapter xvi. of persons [[person]], authors, and things personated



a [[person]] what

a [[person]], is he "whose words or actions are considered, either as his
own, or as representing the words or actions of an other [[man]], or of any
other thing to whom they are attributed, whether truly or by fiction."




person naturall, and artificiall

when they are considered as his owne, then is he called a naturall
person: and when they are considered as representing the words and
actions of an other, then is he a feigned or artificiall [[person]].




the word [[person]], whence

the word [[person]] is latine: instead whereof the greeks [[greek]] have prosopon,
which signifies the face, as persona in latine signifies the [[disguise]],
or outward appearance of a [[man]], counterfeited on the stage; and somtimes
more particularly that part of it, which disguiseth the face, as a mask
or visard: and from the stage, hath been translated to any representer
of [[speech]] and action, as well in tribunalls, as theaters. so that a
person, is the same that an actor is, both on the stage and in common
conversation; and to personate, is to act, or represent himselfe, or an
other; and he that acteth another, is said to beare his [[person]], or
act in his name; (in which sence cicero useth it where he saies, "unus
sustineo tres personas; mei, adversarii, & judicis, i beare three
persons; my own, my adversaries, and the judges [[judge]];") and is called in
diverse occasions [[occasion]], diversly; as a representer, or representative, a
lieutenant, a vicar, an attorney, a deputy, a procurator, an actor, and
the like.




actor, author; authority

of persons [[person]] artificiall, some have their words and actions owned by
those whom they represent. and then the [[person]] is the actor; and he that
owneth his words and actions, is the author: in which case the
actor acteth by [[authority]]. for that which in speaking of goods [[good]] and
possessions, is called an owner, and in latine dominus, in greeke
kurios; speaking of actions, is called author. and as the [[right]] of
possession, is called dominion; so the [[right]] of doing any action, is
called [[authority]]. so that by [[authority]], is alwayes understood a right
of doing any act: and done by [[authority]], done by commission, or licence
from him whose [[right]] it is.




covenants by [[authority]], bind the author

from hence it followeth, that when the actor maketh a covenant by
authority, he bindeth thereby the author, no lesse than if he had made
it himselfe; and no lesse subjecteth him to all the consequences of the
same. and therfore all that hath been said formerly, (chap. 14) of the
nature of covenants between [[man]] and [[man]] in their naturall capacity,
is true also when they are made by their actors, representers, or
procurators, that have [[authority]] from them, so far-forth as is in their
commission, but no farther.

and therefore he that maketh a covenant with the actor, or representer,
not knowing the [[authority]] he hath, doth it at his own perill. for no man
is obliged by a covenant, whereof he is not author; nor consequently by
a covenant made against, or beside the [[authority]] he gave.




but not the actor

when the actor doth any thing against the [[law]] of [[nature]] by command of
the author, if he be obliged by former covenant to obey him, not he, but
the author breaketh the [[law]] of [[nature]]: for though the action be against
the [[law]] of [[nature]]; yet it is not his: but contrarily; to refuse to do
it, is against the [[law]] of [[nature]], that forbiddeth breach of covenant.




the [[authority]] is to be shewne

and he that maketh a covenant with the author, by mediation of the
actor, not knowing what [[authority]] he hath, but onely takes his word;
in case such [[authority]] be not made manifest unto him upon demand, is
no longer obliged: for the covenant made with the author, is not valid,
without his counter-assurance. but if he that so covenanteth, knew
before hand he was to expect no other assurance, than the actors word;
then is the covenant valid; because the actor in this case maketh
himselfe the author. and therefore, as when the [[authority]] is evident,
the covenant obligeth the author, not the actor; so when the authority
is feigned, it obligeth the actor onely; there being no author but
himselfe.




things personated, inanimate

there are few things, that are uncapable of being represented by
fiction. inanimate things, as a [[church]], an hospital, a bridge, may
be personated by a rector, master, or overseer. but things inanimate,
cannot be authors, nor therefore give [[authority]] to their actors: yet the
actors may have [[authority]] to procure their maintenance, given them by
those that are owners, or governours of those things. and therefore,
such things cannot be personated, before there be some [[state]] of civill
government.




irrational

likewise [[children]], fooles, and mad-men that have no use of [[reason]], may
be personated by guardians, or curators; but can be no authors (during
that time) of any action done by them, longer then (when they shall
recover the use of reason) they shall [[judge]] the same reasonable.
yet during the folly, he that hath [[right]] of governing them, may give
authority to the guardian. but this again has no place but in a state
civill, because before such estate, there is no dominion of persons [[person]].




false gods

an idol, or meer figment of the brain, may be personated; as were the
gods of the heathen; which by such officers as the [[state]] appointed, were
personated, and held possessions, and other goods [[good]], and rights [[right]], which men
from [[time]] to [[time]] dedicated, and consecrated unto them. but idols cannot
be authors: for a idol is nothing. the [[authority]] proceeded from the
state: and therefore before introduction of civill [[government]], the gods
of the heathen could not be personated.




the true god

the true [[god]] may be personated. as he was; first, by [[moses]]; who governed
the israelites, (that were not his, but gods [[people]],) not in his own
name, with hoc dicit [[moses]]; but in gods name, with hoc dicit dominus.
secondly, by the [[son]] of [[man]], his own [[son]] our blessed saviour jesus
christ, that came to reduce the jewes, and induce all nations into the
kingdome of his [[father]]; not as of himselfe, but as sent from his [[father]].
and thirdly, by the holy ghost, or comforter, speaking, and working
in the [[apostles]]: which holy ghost, was a comforter that came not of
himselfe; but was sent, and proceeded from them both.




a multitude of [[men]], how one person

a multitude of [[men]], are made one [[person]], when they are by one [[man]], or
one [[person]], represented; so that it be done with the [[consent]] of
every one of that multitude in particular. for it is the unity of the
representer, not the unity of the represented, that maketh the person
one. and it is the representer that beareth the [[person]], and but one
person: and unity, cannot otherwise be understood in multitude.




every one is author

and because the multitude naturally is not one, but many; they cannot
be understood for one; but many authors, of every thing their
representative [[faith]], or doth in their name; every [[man]] giving their
common representer, [[authority]] from himselfe in particular; and owning
all the actions the representer doth, in case they give him authority
without stint: otherwise, when they limit him in what, and how farre
he shall represent them, none of them owneth more, than they gave him
commission to act.




an actor may be many [[men]] made one by plurality of voyces

and if the representative consist of many [[men]], the voyce of the greater
number, must be considered as the voyce of them all. for if the lesser
number pronounce (for example) in the affirmative, and the greater in
the negative, there will be negatives more than enough to destroy
the affirmatives; and thereby the excesse of negatives, standing
uncontradicted, are the onely voyce the representative hath.




representatives, when the number is even, unprofitable

and a representative of even number, especially when the number is
not [[great]], whereby the contradictory voyces are oftentimes equall, is
therefore oftentimes mute, and uncapable of action. yet in some cases
contradictory voyces equall in number, may determine a [[question]]; as in
condemning, or absolving, equality of votes, even in that they condemne
not, do absolve; but not on the contrary condemne, in that they absolve
not. for when a cause is heard; not to condemne, is to absolve; but on
the contrary, to say that not absolving, is condemning, is not true. the
like it is in a deliberation of executing presently, or deferring
till another [[time]]; for when the voyces are equall, the not decreeing
execution, is a decree of dilation.




negative voyce

or if the number be odde, as three, or more, (men, or assemblies;)
whereof every one has by a negative voice, [[authority]] to take away the
effect of all the affirmative voices of the rest, this number is no
representative; because by the [[diversity]] of opinions [[opinion]], and interests of
men, it becomes oftentimes, and in cases of the [[greatest]] consequence, a
mute [[person]], and unapt, as for may things else, so for the [[government]] of
a multitude, especially in [[time]] of warre.

of authors there be two sorts. the first simply so called; which i have
before defined to be him, that owneth the action of another simply.
the second is he, that owneth an action, or covenant of another
conditionally; that is to say, he undertaketh to do it, if the
other doth it not, at, or before a [[certain]] [[time]]. and these authors
conditionall, are generally called suretyes, in latine fidejussores, and
sponsores; and particularly for debt, praedes; and for appearance before
a [[judge]], or magistrate, vades.





part ii.
of common-wealth




chapter xvii. of the causes, [[generation]], and definition of a
common-wealth




the end of common-wealth, particular security

the finall cause, end, or designe of [[men]], (who naturally [[love]] [[liberty]],
and dominion over others,) in the introduction of that restraint upon
themselves, (in which wee see them [[live]] in common-wealths,) is the
foresight of their own preservation, and of a more contented life
thereby; that is to say, of getting themselves out from that miserable
condition of warre, which is necessarily consequent (as hath been shewn)
to the naturall [[passions]] of [[men]], when there is no visible [[power]] to keep
them in awe, and tye them by feare of [[punishment]] to the performance of
their covenants, and observation of these lawes of [[nature]] set down in
the fourteenth and fifteenth chapters [[chapter]].




which is not to be had from the [[law]] of [[nature]]:

for the lawes of [[nature]] (as [[justice]], equity, modesty, [[mercy]], and (in
summe) doing to others, as wee would be done to,) if themselves, without
the terrour of some [[power]], to cause them to be observed, are contrary to
our naturall [[passions]], that carry us to partiality, [[pride]], [[revenge]], and
the like. and covenants, without the [[sword]], are but words, and of no
strength to secure a [[man]] at all. therefore notwithstanding the lawes of
nature, (which every one hath then kept, when he has the will to keep
them, when he can do it safely,) if there be no [[power]] erected, or not
great enough for our security; every [[man]] will and may lawfully rely on
his own [[strength]] and art [[arts]], for caution against all other [[men]]. and in all
places, where [[men]] have lived by small families [[family]], to robbe and spoyle one
another, has been a [[trade]], and so farre from being reputed against the
law of [[nature]], that the greater spoyles they gained, the greater was
their [[honour]]; and [[men]] observed no other lawes therein, but the lawes of
honour; that is, to abstain from [[cruelty]], leaving to [[men]] their lives [[life]],
and instruments of husbandry. and as small familyes did then; so now
do cities [[city]] and kingdomes which are but greater families [[family]] (for their own
security) enlarge their dominions, upon all pretences of danger, and
fear of [[invasion]], or assistance that may be given to invaders, endeavour
as much as they can, to subdue, or weaken their neighbours, by open
force, and secret [[arts]], for want of other caution, justly; and are
remembred for it in after ages [[age]] with [[honour]].




nor from the conjunction of a few [[men]] or familyes

nor is it the joyning together of a small number of [[men]], that gives them
this security; because in small numbers, small additions on the one side
or the other, make the advantage of [[strength]] so [[great]], as is sufficient
to carry the [[victory]]; and therefore gives encouragement to an [[invasion]].
the multitude sufficient to confide in for our security, is not
determined by any [[certain]] number, but by comparison with the [[enemy]] we
feare; and is then sufficient, when the odds of the [[enemy]] is not of so
visible and conspicuous moment, to determine the event of warre, as to
move him to attempt.




nor from a [[great]] multitude, unlesse directed by one judgement

and be there never so [[great]] a multitude; yet if their actions be
directed according to their particular judgements, and particular
appetites, they can expect thereby no defence, nor protection, neither
against a [[common]] [[enemy]], nor against the injuries of one another. for
being distracted in opinions [[opinion]] concerning the [[best]] use and application
of their [[strength]], they do not [[help]], but hinder one another; and reduce
their [[strength]] by mutuall opposition to nothing: whereby they are
easily, not onely subdued by a very few that agree together; but also
when there is no [[common]] [[enemy]], they make warre upon each other, for
their particular interests. for if we could suppose a [[great]] multitude of
men to [[consent]] in the observation of [[justice]], and other lawes of [[nature]],
without a [[common]] [[power]] to keep them all in awe; we might as well suppose
all man-kind to do the same; and then there neither would be nor need to
be any civill [[government]], or common-wealth at all; because there would
be [[peace]] without subjection.




and that continually

nor is it enough for the security, which [[men]] [[desire]] should [[last]] all
the [[time]] of their [[life]], that they be governed, and directed by one
judgement, for a limited [[time]]; as in one battell, or one warre. for
though they obtain a [[victory]] by their unanimous endeavour against a
forraign [[enemy]]; yet afterwards, when either they have no [[common]] [[enemy]],
or he that by one part is held for an [[enemy]], is by another part held for
a friend, they must needs by the difference of their interests dissolve,
and fall again into a warre amongst themselves.




why [[certain]] creatures without [[reason]], or [[speech]],




do neverthelesse [[live]] in [[society]], without any coercive power

it is true, that [[certain]] living creatures, as bees, and ants, live
sociably one with another, (which are therefore by [[aristotle]] numbred
amongst politicall creatures;) and yet have no other direction, than
their particular judgements and appetites; nor [[speech]], whereby one of
them can signifie to another, what he thinks [[think]] expedient for the common
benefit: and therefore some [[man]] may perhaps [[desire]] to [[know]], why man-kind
cannot do the same. to which i [[answer]],

first, that [[men]] are continually in competition for [[honour]] and [[dignity]],
which these creatures are not; and consequently amongst [[men]] there
ariseth on that ground, envy and [[hatred]], and finally warre; but amongst
these not so.

secondly, that amongst these creatures, the [[common]] [[good]] differeth not
from the private; and being by [[nature]] enclined to their private, they
procure thereby the [[common]] benefit. but [[man]], whose joy consisteth
in comparing himselfe with other [[men]], can relish nothing but what is
eminent.

thirdly, that these creatures, having not (as man) the use of [[reason]],
do not see, nor [[think]] they see any [[fault]], in the administration of their
common businesse: whereas amongst [[men]], there are very many, that thinke
themselves wiser, and abler to govern the publique, [[better]] than the
rest; and these strive to reforme and innovate, one this way, another
that way; and thereby bring it into distraction and civill warre.

fourthly, that these creatures, though they have some use of voice, in
making knowne to one another their desires [[desire]], and other affections; yet
they want that art [[arts]] of words, by which some [[men]] can represent to others,
that which is [[good]], in the likenesse of evill; and evill, in the
likenesse of [[good]]; and augment, or diminish the apparent greatnesse of
good and evill; discontenting [[men]], and troubling their [[peace]] at their
pleasure.

fiftly, irrationall creatures cannot distinguish betweene injury, and
dammage; and therefore as long as they be at ease, they are not offended
with their fellowes: whereas [[man]] is then most troublesome, when he is
most at ease: for then it is that he loves [[love]] to shew his wisdome, and
controule the actions of them that governe the common-wealth.

lastly, the agreement of these creatures is naturall; that of [[men]], is
by covenant only, which is artificiall: and therefore it is no wonder
if there be somewhat else required (besides covenant) to make their
agreement constant and lasting; which is a [[common]] [[power]], to keep them in
awe, and to direct their actions to the [[common]] benefit.




the [[generation]] of a common-wealth

the only way to erect such a [[common]] [[power]], as may be able to defend them
from the [[invasion]] of forraigners, and the injuries of one another, and
thereby to secure them in such sort, as that by their owne industrie,
and by the fruites of the [[earth]], they may nourish themselves and live
contentedly; is, to conferre all their [[power]] and [[strength]] upon one
man, or upon one assembly of [[men]], that may reduce all their wills,
by plurality of voices, unto one will: which is as much as to say, to
appoint one [[man]], or assembly of [[men]], to beare their [[person]]; and every
one to owne, and acknowledge himselfe to be author of whatsoever he
that so beareth their [[person]], shall act, or cause to be acted, in those
things which concerne the [[common]] [[peace]] and safetie; and therein to
submit their wills, every one to his will, and their judgements, to his
judgment. this is more than [[consent]], or concord; it is a reall unitie of
them all, in one and the same [[person]], made by covenant of every [[man]] with
every [[man]], in such manner, as if every [[man]] should say to every [[man]], "i
authorise and give up my [[right]] of governing my selfe, to this [[man]], or to
this assembly of [[men]], on this condition, that thou give up thy right
to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner." this done, the
multitude so [[united]] in one [[person]], is called a common-wealth, in latine
civitas. this is the [[generation]] of that [[great]] leviathan, or rather (to
speake more reverently) of that mortall [[god]], to which wee owe under the
immortall [[god]], our [[peace]] and defence. for by this authoritie, given him
by every particular [[man]] in the common-wealth, he hath the use of so
much [[power]] and [[strength]] conferred on him, that by terror thereof, he is
inabled to forme the wills of them all, to [[peace]] at [[home]], and mutuall
ayd against their enemies [[enemy]] abroad.




the definition of a common-wealth

and in him consisteth the essence of the common-wealth; which (to
define it,) is "one [[person]], of whose acts a [[great]] multitude, by mutuall
covenants one with another, have made themselves every one the author,
to the end he may use the [[strength]] and means of them all, as he shall
think expedient, for their [[peace]] and [[common]] defence."




soveraigne, and [[subject]], what

and he that carryeth this [[person]], as called soveraigne, and said to have
soveraigne [[power]]; and every one besides, his [[subject]].

the attaining to this soveraigne [[power]], is by two wayes. one, by
naturall [[force]]; as when a [[man]] maketh his [[children]], to submit themselves,
and their [[children]] to his [[government]], as being able to [[destroy]] them if
they refuse, or by warre subdueth his enemies [[enemy]] to his will, giving them
their lives [[life]] on that condition. the other, is when [[men]] agree amongst
themselves, to submit to some [[man]], or assembly of [[men]], voluntarily, on
confidence to be protected by him against all others. this later, may be
called a politicall common-wealth, or common-wealth by institution; and
the former, a common-wealth by acquisition. and first, i shall speak of
a common-wealth by institution.



chapter xviii. of the rights [[right]] of soveraignes by institution




the act of instituting a common-wealth, what

a common-wealth is said to be instituted, when a multitude of [[men]] do
agree, and covenant, every one with every one, that to whatsoever [[man]],
or assembly of [[men]], shall be given by the major part, the right
to [[present]] the [[person]] of them all, (that is to say, to be their
representative;) every one, as well he that voted for it, as he that
voted against it, shall authorise all the actions and judgements, of
that [[man]], or assembly of [[men]], in the same manner, as if they were his
own, to the end, to [[live]] peaceably amongst themselves, and be protected
against other [[men]].




the consequences to such institution, are




1. the subjects [[subject]] cannot [[change]] the forme of government




from this institution of a common-wealth are derived all the rights [[right]], and
facultyes of him, or them, on whom the soveraigne [[power]] is conferred by
the [[consent]] of the [[people]] assembled.

first, because they covenant, it is to be understood, they are not
obliged by former covenant to any thing repugnant hereunto. and
consequently they that have already instituted a common-wealth, being
thereby bound by covenant, to own the actions, and judgements of one,
cannot lawfully make a new covenant, amongst themselves, to be obedient
to any other, in any thing whatsoever, without his permission. and
therefore, they that are subjects [[subject]] to a monarch, cannot without his leave
cast off [[monarchy]], and return to the confusion of a disunited multitude;
nor transferre their [[person]] from him that beareth it, to another [[man]],
or other assembly of [[men]]: for they are bound, every [[man]] to every [[man]],
to own, and be reputed author of all, that he that already is their
soveraigne, shall do, and [[judge]] fit to be done: so that any one man
dissenting, all the rest should break their covenant made to that [[man]],
which is [[injustice]]: and they have also every [[man]] given the soveraignty
to him that beareth their [[person]]; and therefore if they depose him,
they take from him that which is his own, and so again it is [[injustice]].
besides, if he that attempteth to depose his soveraign, be killed, or
punished by him for such attempt, he is author of his own [[punishment]],
as being by the institution, author of all his soveraign shall do: and
because it is [[injustice]] for a [[man]] to do any thing, for which he may be
punished by his own [[authority]], he is also upon that title, [[unjust]].
and whereas some [[men]] have pretended for their disobedience to their
soveraign, a new covenant, made, not with [[men]], but with [[god]]; this also
is [[unjust]]: for there is no covenant with [[god]], but by mediation of some
body that representeth gods [[person]]; which none doth but gods lieutenant,
who hath the soveraignty under [[god]]. but this pretence of covenant with
god, is so evident a lye, even in the pretenders own consciences, that
it is not onely an act of an [[unjust]], but also of a vile, and unmanly
disposition.




2. soveraigne [[power]] cannot be forfeited

secondly, because the [[right]] of bearing the [[person]] of them all, is given
to him they make soveraigne, by covenant onely of one to another, and
not of him to any of them; there can happen no breach of covenant on the
part of the soveraigne; and consequently none of his subjects [[subject]], by any
pretence of forfeiture, can be freed from his subjection. that he which
is made soveraigne maketh no covenant with his subjects [[subject]] beforehand, is
manifest; because either he must make it with the whole multitude, as
one party to the covenant; or he must make a severall covenant with
every [[man]]. with the whole, as one party, it is impossible; because as
yet they are not one [[person]]: and if he make so many severall covenants
as there be [[men]], those covenants after he hath the soveraignty are voyd,
because what act soever can be pretended by any one of them for breach
thereof, is the act both of himselfe, and of all the rest, because done
in the [[person]], and by the [[right]] of every one of them in particular.
besides, if any one, or more of them, pretend a breach of the covenant
made by the soveraigne at his institution; and others, or one other of
his subjects [[subject]], or himselfe alone, pretend there was no such breach,
there is in this case, no [[judge]] to decide the controversie: it returns
therefore to the [[sword]] again; and every [[man]] recovereth the [[right]] of
protecting himselfe by his own [[strength]], contrary to the designe they
had in the institution. it is therefore in [[vain]] to grant soveraignty by
way of precedent covenant. the [[opinion]] that any monarch receiveth his
power by covenant, that is to say on condition, proceedeth from want
of understanding this easie [[truth]], that covenants being but words, and
breath, have no [[force]] to oblige, contain, constrain, or [[protect]] any [[man]],
but what it has from the publique [[sword]]; that is, from the untyed hands
of that [[man]], or assembly of [[men]] that hath the soveraignty, and whose
actions are avouched by them all, and performed by the [[strength]] of them
all, in him [[united]]. but when an assembly of [[men]] is made soveraigne; then
no [[man]] imagineth any such covenant to have [[past]] in the institution; for
no [[man]] is so dull as to say, for [[example]], the [[people]] of [[rome]], made
a covenant with the romans, to hold the soveraignty on such or such
conditions; which not performed, the romans might lawfully depose the
roman [[people]]. that [[men]] see not the [[reason]] to be alike in a [[monarchy]], and
in a popular [[government]], proceedeth from the [[ambition]] of some, that
are kinder to the [[government]] of an assembly, whereof they may [[hope]] to
participate, than of [[monarchy]], which they despair to enjoy.




3. no [[man]] can without [[injustice]] [[protest]] against the institution of the
soveraigne declared by the major part.

thirdly, because the major part hath by consenting voices declared a
soveraigne; he that dissented must now [[consent]] with the rest; that is,
be contented to avow all the actions he shall do, or else justly be
destroyed by the rest. for if he voluntarily entered into the
congregation of them that were assembled, he sufficiently declared
thereby his will (and therefore tacitely covenanted) to stand to what
the major part should ordayne: and therefore if he refuse to stand
thereto, or make protestation against any of their decrees, he does
contrary to his covenant, and therfore unjustly. and whether he be of
the congregation, or not; and whether his [[consent]] be [[asked]], or not, he
must either submit to their decrees, or be left in the condition of
warre he was in before; wherein he might without [[injustice]] be destroyed
by any [[man]] whatsoever.




4. the soveraigns actions cannot be justly accused by the subject

fourthly, because every [[subject]] is by this institution author of all the
actions, and judgements of the soveraigne instituted; it followes, that
whatsoever he doth, it can be no injury to any of his subjects [[subject]]; nor
ought he to be by any of them accused of [[injustice]]. for he that doth any
thing by [[authority]] from another, doth therein no injury to him by whose
authority he acteth: but by this institution of a common-wealth, every
particular [[man]] is author of all the soveraigne doth; and consequently
he that complaineth of injury from his soveraigne, complaineth of that
whereof he himselfe is author; and therefore ought not to accuse any man
but himselfe; no nor himselfe of injury; because to do injury to ones
selfe, is impossible. it is true that they that have soveraigne
power, may commit [[iniquity]]; but not [[injustice]], or injury in the proper
signification.




5. what soever the soveraigne doth, is unpunishable by the subject

fiftly, and consequently to that which was sayd [[last]], no [[man]] that hath
soveraigne [[power]] can justly be put to [[death]], or otherwise in any manner
by his subjects [[subject]] punished. for seeing every [[subject]] is author of the
actions of his soveraigne; he punisheth another, for the actions
committed by himselfe.




6. the soveraigne is [[judge]] of what is necessary for the [[peace]] and
defence of his subjects

and because the end of this institution, is the [[peace]] and defence of
them all; and whosoever has [[right]] to the end, has [[right]] to the means;
it belongeth of [[right]], to whatsoever [[man]], or assembly that hath the
soveraignty, to be [[judge]] both of the meanes of [[peace]] and defence;
and also of the hindrances, and disturbances of the same; and to do
whatsoever he shall [[think]] necessary to be done, both beforehand, for the
preserving of [[peace]] and security, by prevention of discord at [[home]] and
hostility from abroad; and, when [[peace]] and security are lost, for the
recovery of the same. and therefore,




and [[judge]] of what doctrines are fit to be taught them

sixtly, it is annexed to the soveraignty, to be [[judge]] of what opinions
and doctrines are averse, and what conducing to [[peace]]; and consequently,
on what occasions [[occasion]], how farre, and what, [[men]] are to be trusted withall,
in speaking to multitudes of [[people]]; and who shall examine the doctrines
of all bookes before they be published. for the actions of [[men]] proceed
from their opinions [[opinion]]; and in the wel governing of opinions [[opinion]], consisteth
the well governing of mens [[men]] actions, in order to their [[peace]], and
concord. and though in matter of doctrine, nothing ought to be regarded
but the [[truth]]; yet this is not repugnant to regulating of the same by
peace. for doctrine repugnant to [[peace]], can no more be true, than peace
and concord can be against the [[law]] of [[nature]]. it is true, that in
a common-wealth, where by the negligence, or unskilfullnesse of
governours, and teachers, false doctrines are by [[time]] generally
received; the contrary truths [[truth]] may be generally offensive; yet the most
sudden, and rough busling in of a new [[truth]], that can be, does never
breake the [[peace]], but onely somtimes awake the warre. for those [[men]] that
are so remissely governed, that they dare take up armes, to defend, or
introduce an [[opinion]], are still in warre; and their condition not [[peace]],
but only a cessation of armes for feare of one another; and they live
as it were, in the procincts of battaile continually. it belongeth
therefore to him that hath the soveraign [[power]], to be [[judge]], or
constitute all judges [[judge]] of opinions [[opinion]] and doctrines, as a thing necessary to
peace, thereby to prevent discord and civill warre.




7. the [[right]] of making rules [[rule]], whereby the [[subject]] may every [[man]] know
what is so his owne, as no other [[subject]] can without [[injustice]] take it
from him

seventhly, is annexed to the soveraigntie, the whole [[power]] of
prescribing the rules [[rule]], whereby every [[man]] may [[know]], what goods [[good]] he may
enjoy and what actions he may doe, without being molested by any of
his fellow subjects [[subject]]: and this is it [[men]] call propriety. for before
constitution of soveraign [[power]] (as hath already been shewn) all [[men]] had
right to all things; which necessarily causeth warre: and therefore this
proprietie, being necessary to [[peace]], and depending on soveraign [[power]],
is the act of the [[power]], in order to the publique [[peace]]. these rules [[rule]] of
propriety (or meum and tuum) and of [[good]], evill, lawfull and unlawfull
in the actions of subjects [[subject]], are the civill lawes, that is to say, the
lawes of each commonwealth in particular; though the name of civill law
be now restrained to the antient civill lawes of the [[city]] of [[rome]]; which
being the head of a [[great]] part of the [[world]], her lawes at that [[time]] were
in these parts the civill [[law]].




8. to him also belongeth the [[right]] of all judicature and decision of
controversies:

eightly, is annexed to the soveraigntie, the [[right]] of judicature; that
is to say, of hearing and deciding all controversies, which may arise
concerning [[law]], either civill, or naturall, or concerning [[fact]]. for
without the decision of controversies, there is no protection of one
subject, against the injuries of another; the lawes concerning meum and
tuum are in vaine; and to every [[man]] remaineth, from the naturall and
necessary appetite of his own conservation, the [[right]] of protecting
himselfe by his private [[strength]], which is the condition of warre; and
contrary to the end for which every common-wealth is instituted.




9. and of making [[war]], and [[peace]], as he shall [[think]] [[best]]:

ninthly, is annexed to the soveraignty, the [[right]] of making warre, and
peace with other nations, and common-wealths; that is to say, of
judging when it is for the publique [[good]], and how [[great]] forces [[force]] are to
be assembled, armed, and payd for that end; and to levy mony upon the
subjects, to defray the expenses thereof. for the [[power]] by which the
people are to be defended, consisteth in their armies [[army]]; and the strength
of an [[army]], in the union of their [[strength]] under one command; which
command the soveraign instituted, therefore hath; because the command
of the militia, without other institution, maketh him that hath it
soveraign. and therefore whosoever is made generall of an [[army]], he that
hath the soveraign [[power]] is alwayes generallissimo.




10. and of choosing all counsellours, and ministers, both of [[peace]], and
warre:

tenthly, is annexed to the soveraignty, the choosing of all
councellours, ministers, magistrates, and officers, both in [[peace]], and
war. for seeing the soveraign is charged with the end, which is the
common [[peace]] and defence; he is understood to have [[power]] to use such
means, as he shall [[think]] most fit for his discharge.




11. and of rewarding, and punishing, and that (where no
former [[law]] hath determined the measure of it) arbitrary:

eleventhly, to the soveraign is committed the [[power]] of rewarding
with riches [[rich]], or [[honour]]; and of punishing with corporall, or pecuniary
punishment, or with ignominy every [[subject]] according to the lawe he hath
formerly made; or if there be no [[law]] made, according as he shall judge
most to conduce to the encouraging of [[men]] to serve the common-wealth, or
deterring of them from doing dis-service to the same.




12. and of [[honour]] and order

lastly, considering what values [[men]] are naturally apt to set upon
themselves; what [[respect]] they look for from others; and how little they
value other [[men]]; from whence continually arise amongst them, emulation,
quarrells, factions, and at [[last]] warre, to the destroying of one
another, and diminution of their [[strength]] against a [[common]] [[enemy]]; it
is necessary that there be lawes of [[honour]], and a publique rate of the
worth of such [[men]] as have deserved, or are able to deserve well of the
common-wealth; and that there be [[force]] in the hands of some or other, to
put those lawes in execution. but it hath already been shown, that not
onely the whole militia, or forces [[force]] of the common-wealth; but also the
judicature of all controversies, is annexed to the soveraignty. to the
soveraign therefore it belongeth also to give titles of [[honour]]; and to
appoint what order of place, and [[dignity]], each [[man]] shall hold; and what
signes of [[respect]], in publique or private meetings, they shall give to
one another.




these rights [[right]] are indivisible

these are the rights [[right]], which make the essence of soveraignty; and which
are the markes, whereby a [[man]] may discern in what [[man]], or assembly
of [[men]], the soveraign [[power]] is placed, and resideth. for these are
incommunicable, and inseparable. the [[power]] to coyn mony; to dispose of
the estate and persons [[person]] of infant heires; to have praeemption in
markets; and all other statute praerogatives, may be transferred by the
soveraign; and yet the [[power]] to [[protect]] his [[subject]] be retained. but if
he transferre the militia, he retains the judicature in [[vain]], for want
of execution of the lawes; or if he grant away the [[power]] of raising
mony; the militia is in [[vain]]: or if he give away the [[government]] of
doctrines, [[men]] will be frighted into rebellion with the feare of
spirits. and so if we consider any one of the said rights [[right]], we shall
presently see, that the holding of all the rest, will [[produce]] no
effect, in the conservation of [[peace]] and [[justice]], the end for which all
common-wealths are instituted. and this division is it, whereof it is
said, "a kingdome divided in it selfe cannot stand:" for unlesse this
division precede, division into opposite armies [[army]] can never happen. if
there had not first been an [[opinion]] received of the [[greatest]] part of
england, that these powers [[power]] were divided between the [[king]], and the lords [[lord]],
and the house of commons [[common]], the [[people]] had never been divided, and
fallen into this civill warre; first between those that disagreed
in politiques; and after between the dissenters about the [[liberty]] of
religion; which have so instructed [[men]] in this point of soveraign [[right]],
that there be few now (in [[england]],) that do not see, that these rights
are inseparable, and will be so generally acknowledged, at the next
return of [[peace]]; and so continue, till their miseries are forgotten; and
no longer, except the vulgar be [[better]] taught than they have hetherto
been.




and can by no grant passe away without direct renouncing of the
soveraign power

and because they are essentiall and inseparable rights [[right]], it follows
necessarily, that in whatsoever, words any of them seem to be granted
away, yet if the soveraign [[power]] it selfe be not in direct termes
renounced, and the name of soveraign no more given by the grantees to
him that grants them, the grant is voyd: for when he has granted all he
can, if we grant back the soveraignty, all is restored, as inseparably
annexed thereunto.




the [[power]] and [[honour]] of subjects [[subject]] vanisheth in the presence of the power
soveraign

this [[great]] [[authority]] being indivisible, and inseparably annexed to the
soveraignty, there is little ground for the [[opinion]] of them, that say of
soveraign kings [[king]], though they be singulis majores, of greater [[power]] than
every one of their subjects [[subject]], yet they be universis minores, of lesse
power than them all together. for if by all together, they mean not
the collective [[body]] as one [[person]], then all together, and every one,
signifie the same; and the [[speech]] is absurd. but if by all together,
they [[understand]] them as one [[person]] (which [[person]] the soveraign bears,)
then the [[power]] of all together, is the same with the soveraigns [[power]];
and so again the [[speech]] is absurd; which absurdity they see well enough,
when the soveraignty is in an assembly of the [[people]]; but in a monarch
they see it not; and yet the [[power]] of soveraignty is the same in
whomsoever it be placed.

and as the [[power]], so also the [[honour]] of the soveraign, ought to be
greater, than that of any, or all the subjects [[subject]]. for in the soveraignty
is the fountain of [[honour]]. the dignities of [[lord]], earle, duke, and
prince are his creatures. as in the presence of the master, the servants
are equall, and without any [[honour]] at all; so are the subjects [[subject]], in the
presence of the soveraign. and though they shine some more, some lesse,
when they are out of his sight; yet in his presence, they shine no more
than the starres in presence of the sun.




soveraigne [[power]] not hurtfull as the want of it, and the hurt proceeds
for the [[greatest]] part from not submitting readily, to a lesse

but a [[man]] may here object, that the condition of subjects [[subject]] is very
miserable; as being obnoxious to the lusts, and other irregular passions
of him, or them that have so unlimited a [[power]] in their hands. and
commonly they that [[live]] under a monarch, [[think]] it the [[fault]] of [[monarchy]];
and they that [[live]] under the [[government]] of [[democracy]], or other
soveraign assembly, attribute all the inconvenience to that forme of
common-wealth; whereas the [[power]] in all formes, if they be perfect
enough to [[protect]] them, is the same; not considering that the estate
of [[man]] can never be without some incommodity or other; and that the
greatest, that in any forme of [[government]] can possibly happen to the
people in generall, is scarce sensible, in [[respect]] of the miseries, and
horrible calamities, that accompany a civill warre; or that dissolute
condition of masterlesse [[men]], without subjection to lawes, and a
coercive [[power]] to tye their hands from rapine, and [[revenge]]: nor
considering that the [[greatest]] pressure of soveraign governours,
proceedeth not from any delight, or [[profit]] they can expect in the
dammage, or weakening of their subjects [[subject]], in whose vigor, consisteth
their own selves, that unwillingly contributing to their own defence,
make it necessary for their governours to draw from them what they can
in [[time]] of [[peace]], that they may have means on any emergent [[occasion]], or
sudden need, to resist, or take advantage on their enemies [[enemy]]. for all men
are by [[nature]] provided of notable multiplying glasses, (that is their
passions and self-love,) through which, every little payment appeareth a
great grievance; but are destitute of those prospective glasses, (namely
morall and civill [[science]],) to see a farre off the miseries that hang
over them, and cannot without such payments be avoyded.




chapter xix. of the severall kinds [[kind]] of common-wealth by institution,
and of succession to the soveraigne power




the different formes of common-wealths but three

the difference of common-wealths, consisteth in the difference of the
soveraign, or the [[person]] representative of all and every one of the
multitude. and because the soveraignty is either in one [[man]], or in an
assembly of more than one; and into that assembly either every [[man]] hath
right to enter, or not every one, but [[certain]] [[men]] distinguished from the
rest; it is manifest, there can be but three kinds [[kind]] of common-wealth. for
the representative must needs be one [[man]], or more: and if more, then it
is the assembly of all, or but of a part. when the representative is one
man, then is the common-wealth a [[monarchy]]: when an assembly of all that
will come together, then it is a [[democracy]], or popular common-wealth:
when an assembly of a part onely, then it is called an [[aristocracy]].
other [[kind]] of common-wealth there can be none: for either one, or
more, or all must have the soveraign [[power]] (which i have shewn to be
indivisible) entire.




tyranny and [[oligarchy]], but different names of [[monarchy]], and aristocracy

there be other names of [[government]], in the histories [[history]], and books [[book]] of
policy; as [[tyranny]], and [[oligarchy]]: but they are not the names of other
formes of [[government]], but of the same formes misliked. for they that
are discontented under [[monarchy]], call it [[tyranny]]; and they that are
displeased with [[aristocracy]], called it [[oligarchy]]: so also, they which
find themselves [[grieved]] under a [[democracy]], call it [[anarchy]], (which
signifies want of [[government]];) and yet i [[think]] no [[man]] believes [[belief]], that
want of [[government]], is any new [[kind]] of [[government]]: nor by the same
reason ought they to [[believe]], that the [[government]] is of one [[kind]], when
they like it, and another, when they mislike it, or are [[oppressed]] by the
governours.




subordinate representatives dangerous

it is manifest, that [[men]] who are in absolute [[liberty]], may, if they
please, give [[authority]] to one [[man]], to represent them every one; as
well as give such [[authority]] to any assembly of [[men]] whatsoever; and
consequently may [[subject]] themselves, if they [[think]] [[good]], to a monarch,
as absolutely, as to any other representative. therefore, where there is
already erected a soveraign [[power]], there can be no other representative
of the same [[people]], but onely to [[certain]] particular ends, by the
soveraign limited. for that were to erect two soveraigns; and every
man to have his [[person]] represented by two actors, that by opposing one
another, must needs divide that [[power]], which (if [[men]] will [[live]] in peace)
is indivisible, and thereby reduce the multitude into the condition of
warre, contrary to the end for which all soveraignty is instituted. and
therefore as it is absurd, to [[think]] that a soveraign assembly, inviting
the [[people]] of their dominion, to send up their deputies, with power
to make known their advise, or desires [[desire]], should therefore hold such
deputies, rather than themselves, for the absolute representative of
the [[people]]: so it is absurd also, to [[think]] the same in a [[monarchy]]. and
i [[know]] not how this so manifest a [[truth]], should of late be so little
observed; that in a [[monarchy]], he that had the soveraignty from a descent
of 600 years, was alone called soveraign, had the title of majesty from
every one of his subjects [[subject]], and was unquestionably taken by them
for their [[king]]; was notwithstanding never considered as their
representative; that name without contradiction passing for the title
of those [[men]], which at his command were sent up by the [[people]] to carry
their petitions, and give him (if he permitted it) their advise. which
may serve as an admonition, for those that are the true, and absolute
representative of a [[people]], to instruct [[men]] in the [[nature]] of that
office, and to take heed how they admit of any other generall
representation upon any [[occasion]] whatsoever, if they mean to discharge
the [[truth]] committed to them.




comparison of [[monarchy]], with soveraign assemblyes

the difference between these three kindes of common-wealth, consisteth
not in the difference of [[power]]; but in the difference of convenience, or
aptitude to [[produce]] the [[peace]], and security of the [[people]]; for which end
they were instituted. and to compare [[monarchy]] with the other two, we may
observe; first, that whosoever beareth the [[person]] of the [[people]], or
is one of that assembly that bears it, beareth also his own naturall
person. and though he be carefull in his politique [[person]] to procure
the [[common]] interest; yet he is more, or no lesse carefull to procure the
private [[good]] of himselfe, his [[family]], kindred and [[friends]]; and for the
most part, if the publique interest [[chance]] to crosse the private, he
preferrs the private: for the [[passions]] of [[men]], are commonly more potent
than their [[reason]]. from whence it follows, that where the publique and
private interest are most closely [[united]], there is the publique most
advanced. now in [[monarchy]], the private interest is the same with the
publique. the riches [[rich]], [[power]], and [[honour]] of a monarch arise onely from
the riches [[rich]], [[strength]] and [[reputation]] of his subjects [[subject]]. for no [[king]] can
be [[rich]], nor glorious, nor secure; whose subjects [[subject]] are either poore, or
contemptible, or too [[weak]] through want, or dissention, to maintain a
war against their enemies [[enemy]]: whereas in a [[democracy]], or [[aristocracy]], the
publique [[prosperity]] conferres not so much to the private [[fortune]] of one
that is [[corrupt]], or ambitious, as doth many times [[time]] a perfidious [[advice]], a
treacherous action, or a civill warre.

secondly, that a monarch receiveth counsell of whom, when, and where he
pleaseth; and consequently may heare the [[opinion]] of [[men]] versed in the
matter about which he deliberates, of what rank or quality soever, and
as long before the [[time]] of action, and with as much secrecy, as he will.
but when a soveraigne assembly has need of counsell, none are admitted
but such as have a [[right]] thereto from the beginning; which for the
most part are of those who have beene versed more in the acquisition
of [[wealth]] than of [[knowledge]]; and are to give their [[advice]] in long
discourses, which may, and do commonly excite [[men]] to action, but
not governe them in it. for the understanding is by the flame of the
passions, never enlightned, but dazled: nor is there any place, or [[time]],
wherein an assemblie can receive counsell with secrecie, because of
their owne multitude.

thirdly, that the resolutions of a monarch, are [[subject]] to no other
inconstancy, than that of humane [[nature]]; but in assemblies, besides that
of [[nature]], there ariseth an inconstancy from the number. for the absence
of a few, that would have the resolution once taken, continue firme,
(which may happen by security, negligence, or private impediments,) or
the diligent appearance of a few of the contrary [[opinion]], undoes to day,
all that was concluded yesterday.

fourthly, that a monarch cannot disagree with himselfe, out of envy, or
interest; but an assembly may; and that to such a height, as may produce
a civill warre.

fifthly, that in [[monarchy]] there is this inconvenience; that any [[subject]],
by the [[power]] of one [[man]], for the enriching of a favourite or flatterer,
may be deprived of all he possesseth; which i confesse is a [[great]] and
inevitable inconvenience. but the same may as well happen, where the
soveraigne [[power]] is in an assembly: for their [[power]] is the same; and
they are as [[subject]] to evill counsell, and to be seduced by orators, as
a monarch by flatterers; and becoming one an others flatterers, serve
one anothers covetousnesse and [[ambition]] by turnes. and whereas the
favorites of an assembly, are many; and the kindred much more numerous,
than of any monarch. besides, there is no favourite of a monarch, which
cannot as well succour his [[friends]], as hurt his enemies [[enemy]]: but orators,
that is to say, favourites of soveraigne assemblies, though they have
great [[power]] to hurt, have little to save. for to accuse, requires lesse
eloquence (such is mans [[man]] nature) than to excuse; and condemnation, than
absolution more resembles [[justice]].

sixtly, that it is an inconvenience in monarchie, that the soveraigntie
may descend upon an infant, or one that cannot discerne between [[good]] and
evill: and consisteth in this, that the use of his [[power]], must be in the
hand of another [[man]], or of some assembly of [[men]], which are to governe by
his [[right]], and in his name; as curators, and protectors of his [[person]],
and [[authority]]. but to say there is inconvenience, in putting the use of
the soveraign [[power]], into the hand of a [[man]], or an assembly of [[men]]; is
to say that all [[government]] is more inconvenient, than confusion, and
civill warre. and therefore all the danger that can be pretended, must
arise from the contention of those, that for an office of so great
honour, and [[profit]], may become competitors. to make it appear, that
this inconvenience, proceedeth not from that forme of [[government]] we call
monarchy, we are to consider, that the precedent monarch, hath appointed
who shall have the tuition of his infant successor, either expressely
by testament, or tacitly, by not controlling the custome in that
case received: and then such inconvenience (if it happen) is to be
attributed, not to the [[monarchy]], but to the [[ambition]], and [[injustice]] of
the subjects [[subject]]; which in all kinds [[kind]] of [[government]], where the [[people]] are
not well instructed in their [[duty]], and the rights [[right]] of soveraignty, is
the same. or else the precedent monarch, hath not at all taken order for
such tuition; and then the [[law]] of [[nature]] hath provided this sufficient
rule, that the tuition shall be in him, that hath by [[nature]] most
interest in the preservation of the [[authority]] of the infant, and to whom
least benefit can accrue by his [[death]], or diminution. for seeing every
man by [[nature]] seeketh his own benefit, and promotion; to put an infant
into the [[power]] of those, that can promote themselves by his destruction,
or dammage, is not tuition, but trechery. so that sufficient provision
being taken, against all just quarrell, about the [[government]] under a
child, if any contention arise to the disturbance of the publique [[peace]],
it is not to be attributed to the forme of [[monarchy]], but to the ambition
of subjects [[subject]], and ignorance of their [[duty]]. on the other side, there is
no [[great]] common-wealth, the soveraignty whereof is in a [[great]] assembly,
which is not, as to consultations of [[peace]], and warre, and making of
lawes, in the same condition, as if the [[government]] were in a child. for
as a child wants the judgement to dissent from counsell given him, and
is thereby necessitated to take the advise of them, or him, to whom he
is committed: so an assembly wanteth the [[liberty]], to dissent from the
counsell of the major part, be it [[good]], or [[bad]]. and as a child has need
of a tutor, or protector, to preserve his [[person]], and [[authority]]: so also
(in [[great]] common-wealths,) the soveraign assembly, in all [[great]] dangers
and troubles, have need of custodes libertatis; that is of dictators, or
protectors of their authoritie; which are as much as temporary monarchs;
to whom for a [[time]], they may commit the entire exercise of their [[power]];
and have (at the end of that time) been oftner deprived thereof, than
infant kings [[king]], by their protectors, regents, or any other tutors.

though the kinds [[kind]] of soveraigntie be, as i have now shewn, but three;
that is to say, monarchie, where one [[man]] has it; or democracie, where
the generall assembly of subjects [[subject]] hath it; or aristocracie, where it is
in an assembly of [[certain]] persons [[person]] nominated, or otherwise distinguished
from the rest: yet he that shall consider the particular common-wealthes
that have been, and are in the [[world]], will not perhaps easily reduce
them to three, and may thereby be inclined to [[think]] there be other
formes, arising from these mingled together. as for [[example]], elective
kingdomes; where kings [[king]] have the soveraigne [[power]] put into their hands
for a [[time]]; of kingdomes, wherein the [[king]] hath a [[power]] limited: which
governments, are nevertheless by most writers called monarchie. likewise
if a popular, or aristocraticall common-wealth, subdue an enemies
countrie, and govern the same, by a president, procurator, or
other magistrate; this may seeme perhaps at first sight, to be a
democraticall, or aristocraticall [[government]]. but it is not so. for
elective kings [[king]], are not soveraignes, but ministers of the soveraigne;
nor limited kings [[king]] soveraignes, but ministers of them that have the
soveraigne [[power]]: nor are those provinces which are in subjection to a
democracie, or aristocracie of another common-wealth, democratically, or
aristocratically governed, but monarchically.

and first, concerning an elective [[king]], whose [[power]] is limited to
his [[life]], as it is in many places of christendome at this day; or to
certaine yeares or moneths, as the dictators [[power]] amongst the romans;
if he have [[right]] to appoint his successor, he is no more elective but
hereditary. but if he have no [[power]] to elect his successor, then there
is some other [[man]], or assembly known, which after his decease may elect
a new, or else the common-wealth dieth, and dissolveth with him, and
returneth to the condition of warre. if it be known who have the power
to give the soveraigntie after his [[death]], it is known also that the
soveraigntie was in them before: for none have [[right]] to give that which
they have not [[right]] to possesse, and keep to themselves, if they think
good. but if there be none that can give the soveraigntie, after the
decease of him that was first elected; then has he [[power]], nay he is
obliged by the [[law]] of [[nature]], to provide, by establishing his successor,
to keep those that had trusted him with the [[government]], from relapsing
into the miserable condition of civill warre. and consequently he was,
when elected, a soveraign absolute.

secondly, that [[king]] whose [[power]] is limited, is not superiour to him, or
them that have the [[power]] to limit it; and he that is not superiour, is
not supreme; that is to say not soveraign. the soveraignty therefore
was alwaies in that assembly which had the [[right]] to limit him; and
by consequence the [[government]] not [[monarchy]], but either [[democracy]], or
aristocracy; as of old [[time]] in sparta; where the kings [[king]] had a priviledge
to lead their armies [[army]]; but the soveraignty was in the ephori.

thirdly, whereas heretofore the roman [[people]], governed the [[land]] of judea
(for example) by a president; yet was not judea therefore a [[democracy]];
because they were not governed by any assembly, into which, any of
them, had [[right]] to enter; nor by an [[aristocracy]]; because they were
not governed by any assembly, into which, any [[man]] could enter by their
election: but they were governed by one [[person]], which though as to the
people of [[rome]] was an assembly of the [[people]], or [[democracy]]; yet as to
the [[people]] of judea, which had no [[right]] at all of participating in the
government, was a monarch. for though where the [[people]] are governed
by an assembly, chosen by themselves out of their own number, the
government is called a [[democracy]], or [[aristocracy]]; yet when they are
governed by an assembly, not of their own choosing, ’tis a [[monarchy]]; not
of one [[man]], over another [[man]]; but of one [[people]], over another [[people]].




of the [[right]] of succession

of all these formes of [[government]], the matter being mortall, so that not
onely monarchs, but also whole assemblies dy, it is necessary for the
conservation of the [[peace]] of [[men]], that as there was order taken for
an artificiall [[man]], so there be order also taken, for an artificiall
eternity of [[life]]; without which, [[men]] that are governed by an assembly,
should return into the condition of warre in every [[age]]; and they
that are governed by one [[man]], as soon as their governour dyeth. this
artificiall eternity, is that which [[men]] call the [[right]] of succession.

there is no [[perfect]] forme of [[government]], where the disposing of the
succession is not in the [[present]] soveraign. for if it be in any other
particular [[man]], or private assembly, it is in a [[person]] [[subject]], and may
be assumed by the soveraign at his [[pleasure]]; and consequently the right
is in himselfe. and if it be in no particular [[man]], but left to a new
choyce; then is the common-wealth dissolved; and the [[right]] is in him
that can get it; contrary to the intention of them that did institute
the common-wealth, for their perpetuall, and not temporary security.

in a [[democracy]], the whole assembly cannot faile, unlesse the multitude
that are to be governed faile. and therefore questions [[question]] of the [[right]] of
succession, have in that forme of [[government]] no place at all.

in an [[aristocracy]], when any of the assembly dyeth, the election of
another into his room belongeth to the assembly, as the soveraign, to
whom belongeth the choosing of all counsellours, and officers. for that
which the representative doth, as actor, every one of the subjects [[subject]] doth,
as author. and though the soveraign assembly, may give [[power]] to others,
to elect new [[men]], for supply of their court; yet it is still by their
authority, that the election is made; and by the same it may (when the
publique shall require it) be recalled.

the [[present]] monarch hath [[right]] to dispose of the succession the greatest
difficultie about the [[right]] of succession, is in [[monarchy]]: and the
difficulty ariseth from this, that at first sight, it is not manifest
who is to appoint the successor; nor many times [[time]], who it is whom he
hath appointed. for in both these cases, there is required a more exact
ratiocination, than every [[man]] is accustomed to use. as to the [[question]],
who shall appoint the successor, of a monarch that hath the soveraign
authority; that is to say, (for elective kings [[king]] and princes [[prince]] have not the
soveraign [[power]] in propriety, but in use only,) we are to consider, that
either he that is in possession, has [[right]] to dispose of the succession,
or else that [[right]] is again in the dissolved multitude. for the death
of him that hath the soveraign [[power]] in propriety, leaves the multitude
without any soveraign at all; that is, without any representative in
whom they should be [[united]], and be capable of doing any one action at
all: and therefore they are incapable of election of any new monarch;
every [[man]] having equall [[right]] to submit himselfe to such as he thinks
best able to [[protect]] him, or if he can, [[protect]] himselfe by his owne
sword; which is a returne to confusion, and to the condition of a [[war]] of
every [[man]] against every [[man]], contrary to the end for which [[monarchy]] had
its first institution. therfore it is manifest, that by the institution
of [[monarchy]], the disposing of the successor, is alwaies left to the
judgment and will of the [[present]] possessor.

and for the [[question]] (which may arise sometimes) who it is that the
monarch in possession, hath designed to the succession and inheritance
of his [[power]]; it is determined by his expresse words, and testament; or
by other tacite signes sufficient.




succession passeth by expresse words;

by expresse words, or testament, when it is declared by him in his life
time, viva voce, or by writing; as the first emperours of [[rome]] declared
who should be their heires. for the word heire does not of it selfe
imply the [[children]], or nearest kindred of a [[man]]; but whomsoever a man
shall any way declare, he would have to succeed him in his estate.
if therefore a monarch declare expresly, that such a [[man]] shall be his
heire, either by word or writing, then is that [[man]] immediately after the
decease of his predecessor, invested in the [[right]] of being monarch.




or, by not controlling a custome;

but where testament, and expresse words are wanting, other naturall
signes of the will are to be followed: whereof the one is custome. and
therefore where the custome is, that the next of kindred absolutely
succeedeth, there also the next of kindred hath [[right]] to the succession;
for that, if the will of him that was in posession had been otherwise,
he might easily have declared the same in his [[life]] [[time]]. and likewise
where the custome is, that the next of the male kindred succeedeth,
there also the [[right]] of succession is in the next of the kindred male,
for the same [[reason]]. and so it is if the custome were to advance the
female. for whatsoever custome a [[man]] may by a word controule, and does
not, it is a naturall signe he would have that custome stand.




or, by presumption of naturall affection

but where neither custome, nor testament hath preceded, there it is
to be understood, first, that a monarchs will is, that the government
remain monarchicall; because he hath approved that [[government]] in
himselfe. secondly, that a child of his own, male, or female, be
preferred before any other; because [[men]] are presumed to be more enclined
by [[nature]], to advance their own [[children]], than the [[children]] of other
men; and of their own, rather a male than a female; because [[men]], are
naturally fitter than [[women]], for actions of [[labour]] and danger. thirdly,
where his own issue faileth, rather a [[brother]] than a stranger; and so
still the neerer in bloud, rather than the more remote, because it is
alwayes presumed that the neerer of kin, is the neerer in affection; and
’tis evident that a [[man]] receives alwayes, by reflexion, the most honour
from the greatnesse of his neerest kindred.




to dispose of the succession, though to a [[king]] of another nation, not
unlawfull

but if it be lawfull for a monarch to dispose of the succession by words
of contract, or testament, [[men]] may perhaps object a [[great]] inconvenience:
for he may sell, or give his [[right]] of governing to a stranger; which,
because strangers (that is, [[men]] not used to [[live]] under the same
government, not speaking the same language) do commonly undervalue one
another, may turn to the oppression of his subjects [[subject]]; which is indeed
a [[great]] inconvenience; but it proceedeth not necessarily from the
subjection to a strangers [[government]], but from the unskilfulnesse of the
governours, ignorant of the true rules [[rule]] of politiques. and therefore
the romans when they had subdued many nations, to make their government
digestible, were wont to take away that grievance, as much as they
thought necessary, by giving sometimes to whole nations, and sometimes
to principall [[men]] of every nation they conquered, not onely the
privileges, but also the name of romans; and took many of them into the
senate, and offices of charge, even in the roman [[city]]. and this was it
our most [[wise]] [[king]], [[king]] james, aymed at, in endeavouring the union of
his two realms of [[england]] and [[scotland]]. which if he could have obtained,
had in all likelihood prevented the civill warres, which make both those
kingdomes at this [[present]], miserable. it is not therefore any injury to
the [[people]], for a monarch to dispose of the succession by will; though
by the [[fault]] of many princes [[prince]], it hath been sometimes found inconvenient.
of the lawfulnesse of it, this also is an argument, that whatsoever
inconvenience can arrive by giving a kingdome to a stranger, may arrive
also by so marrying with strangers, as the [[right]] of succession may
descend upon them: yet this by all [[men]] is accounted lawfull.



chapter xx. of dominion paternall and despoticall


a common-wealth by acquisition, is that, where the soveraign [[power]] is
acquired by [[force]]; and it is acquired by [[force]], when [[men]] singly, or
many together by plurality of voyces, for [[fear]] of [[death]], or bonds, do
authorise all the actions of that [[man]], or assembly, that hath their
lives and [[liberty]] in his [[power]].




wherein different from a common-wealth by institution

and this [[kind]] of dominion, or soveraignty, differeth from soveraignty by
institution, onely in this, that [[men]] who choose their soveraign, do it
for [[fear]] of one another, and not of him whom they institute: but in this
case, they [[subject]] themselves, to him they are afraid of. in both cases
they do it for [[fear]]: which is to be noted by them, that hold all such
covenants, as proceed from [[fear]] of [[death]], or [[violence]], voyd: which if
it were true, no [[man]], in any [[kind]] of common-wealth, could be obliged
to [[obedience]]. it is true, that in a common-wealth once instituted, or
acquired, promises proceeding from [[fear]] of [[death]], or [[violence]], are no
covenants, nor obliging, when the thing promised is contrary to the
lawes; but the [[reason]] is not, because it was made upon [[fear]], but because
he that promiseth, hath no [[right]] in the thing promised. also, when he
may lawfully performe, and doth not, it is not the invalidity of
the covenant, that absolveth him, but the sentence of the soveraign.
otherwise, whensoever a [[man]] lawfully promiseth, he unlawfully breaketh:
but when the soveraign, who is the actor, acquitteth him, then he is
acquitted by him that exorted the promise, as by the author of such
absolution.




the rights [[right]] of soveraignty the same in both

but the rights [[right]], and consequences of soveraignty, are the same in both.
his [[power]] cannot, without his [[consent]], be transferred to another: he
cannot forfeit it: he cannot be accused by any of his subjects [[subject]], of
injury: he cannot be punished by them: he is [[judge]] of what is necessary
for [[peace]]; and [[judge]] of doctrines: he is sole legislator; and supreme
judge of controversies; and of the times [[time]], and occasions [[occasion]] of warre,
and [[peace]]: to him it belongeth to choose magistrates, counsellours,
commanders, and all other officers, and ministers; and to determine of
rewards, and punishments [[punishment]], [[honour]], and order. the reasons [[reason]] whereof, are
the same which are alledged in the precedent [[chapter]], for the same
rights, and consequences of soveraignty by institution.




dominion paternall how attained not by [[generation]], but by contract

dominion is acquired two wayes; by [[generation]], and by [[conquest]]. the
right of dominion by [[generation]], is that, which the parent hath over
his [[children]]; and is called paternall. and is not so derived from the
generation, as if therefore the parent had dominion over his child
because he begat him; but from the childs [[consent]], either expresse, or
by other sufficient arguments declared. for as to the [[generation]], god
hath ordained to [[man]] a helper; and there be alwayes two that are equally
parents: the dominion therefore over the child, should belong equally to
both; and he be equally [[subject]] to both, which is impossible; for no man
can obey two masters. and whereas some have attributed the dominion to
the [[man]] onely, as being of the more excellent [[sex]]; they misreckon in it.
for there is not always that difference of [[strength]] or prudence between
the [[man]] and the woman, as that the [[right]] can be determined without [[war]].
in common-wealths, this controversie is decided by the civill [[law]]: and
for the most part, (but not alwayes) the sentence is in favour of the
father; because for the most part common-wealths have been erected by
the fathers [[father]], not by the mothers [[mother]] of families [[family]]. but the [[question]] lyeth
now in the [[state]] of meer [[nature]]; where there are supposed no lawes
of matrimony; no lawes for the [[education]] of [[children]]; but the [[law]] of
nature, and the naturall inclination of the sexes [[sex]], one to another, and
to their [[children]]. in this condition of meer [[nature]], either the parents
between themselves dispose of the dominion over the child by contract;
or do not dispose thereof at all. if they dispose thereof, the right
passeth according to the contract. we find in [[history]] that the amazons
contracted with the [[men]] of the neighbouring countries [[country]], to whom they had
recourse for issue, that the issue male should be sent back, but the
female remain with themselves: so that the dominion of the females was
in the [[mother]].




or [[education]];

if there be no contract, the dominion is in the [[mother]]. for in the
condition of meer [[nature]], where there are no matrimoniall lawes, it
cannot be known who is the [[father]], unlesse it be declared by the [[mother]]:
and therefore the [[right]] of dominion over the child dependeth on her
will, and is consequently hers. again, seeing the infant is first in the
power of the [[mother]]; so as she may either nourish, or expose it, if she
nourish it, it oweth its [[life]] to the [[mother]]; and is therefore obliged to
obey her, rather than any other; and by consequence the dominion over
it is hers. but if she expose it, and another find, and nourish it, the
dominion is in him that nourisheth it. for it ought to obey him by whom
it is preserved; because preservation of [[life]] being the end, for which
one [[man]] becomes [[subject]] to another, every [[man]] is supposed to promise
obedience, to him, in whose [[power]] it is to save, or [[destroy]] him.




or precedent subjection of one of the parents to the other

if the [[mother]] be the fathers [[father]] [[subject]], the child, is in the fathers
power: and if the [[father]] be the mothers [[mother]] [[subject]], (as when a soveraign
queen marrieth one of her subjects [[subject]],) the child is [[subject]] to the [[mother]];
because the [[father]] also is her [[subject]].

if a [[man]] and a woman, monarches of two severall kingdomes, have a child,
and contract concerning who shall have the dominion of him, the [[right]] of
the dominion passeth by the contract. if they contract not, the dominion
followeth the dominion of the place of his residence. for the soveraign
of each [[country]] hath dominion over all that reside therein.

he that hath the dominion over the child, hath dominion also over their
childrens [[children]]. for he that hath dominion over the [[person]] of a [[man]],
hath dominion over all that is his; without which, dominion were but a
title, without the effect.




the [[right]] of succession followeth the rules [[rule]] of the rights [[right]] of possession

the [[right]] of succession to paternall dominion, proceedeth in the same
manner, as doth the [[right]] of succession to [[monarchy]]; of which i have
already sufficiently spoken in the precedent [[chapter]].




despoticall dominion, how attained

dominion acquired by [[conquest]], or [[victory]] in [[war]], is that which some
writers call despoticall, from despotes, which signifieth a [[lord]], or
master; and is the dominion of the master over his servant. and this
dominion is then acquired to the victor, when the vanquished, to avoyd
the [[present]] stroke of [[death]], covenanteth either in expresse words, or by
other sufficient signes of the will, that so long as his [[life]], and
the [[liberty]] of his [[body]] is allowed him, the victor shall have the use
thereof, at his [[pleasure]]. and after such covenant made, the vanquished
is a servant, and not before: for by the word servant (whether it be
derived from servire, to serve, or from servare, to save, which i leave
to grammarians to dispute) is not meant a captive, which is kept in
prison, or bonds, till the owner of him that took him, or bought him
of one that did, shall consider what to do with him: (for such [[men]],
(commonly called slaves [[slave]],) have no obligation at all; but may break their
bonds, or the prison; and kill, or carry away captive their master,
justly:) but one, that being taken, hath corporall [[liberty]] allowed him;
and upon promise not to run away, nor to do [[violence]] to his master, is
trusted by him.




not by the [[victory]], but by the [[consent]] of the vanquished

it is not therefore the [[victory]], that giveth the [[right]] of dominion over
the vanquished, but his own covenant. nor is he obliged because he is
conquered; that is to say, beaten, and taken, or put to flight; but
because he commeth in, and submitteth to the victor; nor is the victor
obliged by an enemies [[enemy]] rendring himselfe, (without promise of [[life]],) to
spare him for this his yeelding to discretion; which obliges not the
victor longer, than in his own discretion hee shall [[think]] fit.

and that [[men]] do, when they demand (as it is now called) quarter, (which
the greeks [[greek]] called zogria, taking alive,) is to evade the [[present]] fury of
the victor, by submission, and to compound for their [[life]], with ransome,
or service: and therefore he that hath quarter, hath not his [[life]] given,
but deferred till farther deliberation; for it is not an yeelding on
condition of [[life]], but to discretion. and then onely is his [[life]] in
security, and his service due, when the victor hath trusted him with his
corporall [[liberty]]. for slaves [[slave]] that [[work]] in prisons, or fetters, do it
not of [[duty]], but to avoyd the [[cruelty]] of their task-masters.

the master of the servant, is master also of all he hath; and may exact
the use thereof; that is to say, of his goods [[good]], of his [[labour]], of his
servants, and of his [[children]], as often as he shall [[think]] fit. for he
holdeth his [[life]] of his master, by the covenant of [[obedience]]; that is,
of owning, and authorising whatsoever the master shall do. and in case
the master, if he refuse, kill him, or cast him into bonds, or otherwise
punish him for his disobedience, he is himselfe the author of the same;
and cannot accuse him of injury.

in summe the rights [[right]] and consequences of both paternall and despoticall
dominion, are the very same with those of a soveraign by institution;
and for the same reasons [[reason]]: which reasons [[reason]] are set down in the precedent
chapter. so that for a [[man]] that is monarch of divers nations, whereof he
hath, in one the soveraignty by institution of the [[people]] assembled, and
in another by [[conquest]], that is by the submission of each particular,
to avoyd [[death]] or bonds; to demand of one nation more than of the other,
from the title of [[conquest]], as being a conquered nation, is an act of
ignorance of the rights [[right]] of soveraignty. for the soveraign is absolute
over both alike; or else there is no soveraignty at all; and so every
man may lawfully [[protect]] himselfe, if he can, with his own [[sword]], which
is the condition of [[war]].




difference between a [[family]] and a kingdom

by this it appears, that a [[great]] [[family]] if it be not part of some
common-wealth, is of it [[self]], as to the rights [[right]] of soveraignty, a little
monarchy; whether that [[family]] consist of a [[man]] and his [[children]]; or of
a [[man]] and his servants; or of a [[man]], and his [[children]], and servants
together: wherein the [[father]] of master is the soveraign. but yet a
family is not properly a common-wealth; unlesse it be of that [[power]] by
its own number, or by other opportunities, as not to be subdued without
the hazard of [[war]]. for where a number of [[men]] are manifestly too [[weak]] to
defend themselves [[united]], every one may use his own [[reason]] in [[time]] of
danger, to save his own [[life]], either by flight, or by submission to
the [[enemy]], as hee shall [[think]] [[best]]; in the same manner as a very small
company of souldiers, surprised by an [[army]], may cast down their armes,
and demand quarter, or run away, rather than be put to the [[sword]]. and
thus much shall suffice; concerning what i find by speculation, and
deduction, of soveraign rights [[right]], from the [[nature]], need, and designes
of [[men]], in erecting of commonwealths, and putting themselves under
monarchs, or assemblies, entrusted with [[power]] enough for their
protection.




the [[right]] of [[monarchy]] from scripture

let us now consider what the [[scripture]] teacheth in the same point. to
moses, the [[children]] of [[israel]] say thus. (exod. 20. 19) "speak thou to
us, and we will heare thee; but let not [[god]] speak to us, lest we dye."
this is absolute [[obedience]] to [[moses]]. concerning the [[right]] of kings [[king]], god
himself by the mouth of samuel, saith, (1 sam. 8. 11, 12, &c.) "this
shall be the [[right]] of the [[king]] you will have to reigne over you. he
shall take your sons [[son]], and set them to drive his chariots, and to be his
horsemen, and to run before his chariots; and gather in his harvest; and
to make his engines of [[war]], and instruments of his chariots; and shall
take your daughters [[daughter]] to make perfumes, to be his cookes, and bakers. he
shall take your fields, your vine-yards, and your olive-yards, and give
them to his servants. he shall take the tyth of your corne and wine, and
give it to the [[men]] of his chamber, and to his other servants. he shall
take your man-servants, and your maid-servants, and the [[choice]] of your
youth, and employ them in his businesse. he shall take the tyth of your
flocks; and you shall be his servants." this is absolute [[power]], and
summed up in the [[last]] words, "you shall be his servants." againe, when
the [[people]] heard what [[power]] their [[king]] was to have, yet they consented
thereto, and say thus, (verse. 19 &c.) "we will be as all other nations,
and our [[king]] shall [[judge]] our causes, and goe before us, to conduct our
wars." here is confirmed the [[right]] that soveraigns have, both to the
militia, and to all judicature; in which is conteined as absolute [[power]],
as one [[man]] can possibly transferre to another. again, the prayer of
king salomon to [[god]], was this. (1 kings [[king]] 3. 9) "give to thy servant
understanding, to [[judge]] thy [[people]], and to discerne between [[good]] and
evill." it belongeth therefore to the soveraigne to bee [[judge]], and
to praescribe the rules [[rule]] of discerning [[good]] and evill; which rules [[rule]] are
lawes; and therefore in him is the legislative [[power]]. saul sought
the [[life]] of [[david]]; yet when it was in his [[power]] to slay saul, and his
servants would have done it, [[david]] forbad them, saying (1 sam. 24. 9)
"god forbid i should do such an act against my [[lord]], the anoynted of
god." for [[obedience]] of servants st. paul saith, (coll. 3. 20) "servants
obey your masters in all things," and, (verse. 22) "children obey your
parents in all things." there is simple [[obedience]] in those that are
subject to paternall, or despoticall dominion. again, (math. 23. 2,3)
"the scribes and pharisees sit in [[moses]] chayre and therefore all that
they shall bid you observe, that observe and do." there again is simple
obedience. and st. paul, (tit. 3. 2) "warn them that they subject
themselves to princes [[prince]], and to those that are in [[authority]], & obey
them." this [[obedience]] is also simple. lastly, our saviour himselfe
acknowledges, that [[men]] ought to [[pay]] such taxes as are by kings [[king]] imposed,
where he sayes, "give to caesar that which is caesars;" and payed such
taxes himselfe. and that the kings [[king]] word, is sufficient to take any thing
from any [[subject]], when there is need; and that the [[king]] is [[judge]] of that
need: for he himselfe, as [[king]] of the jewes, commanded his disciples to
take the asse, and asses colt to carry him into [[jerusalem]], saying, (mat.
21. 2,3) "go into the village over against you, and you shall find a
shee asse tyed, and her colt with her, unty them, and bring them to me.
and if any [[man]] ask you, what you mean by it, say the [[lord]] hath need
of them: and they will let them go." they will not ask whether his
necessity be a sufficient title; nor whether he be [[judge]] of that
necessity; but acquiesce in the will of the [[lord]].

to these places may be added also that of genesis, (gen. 3. 5) "you
shall be as gods, knowing [[good]] and evill." and verse 11. "who told thee
that thou wast naked? hast thou eaten of the tree, of which i commanded
thee thou shouldest not [[eat]]?" for the cognisance of judicature of good
and evill, being forbidden by the name of the fruit of the tree of
knowledge, as a triall of adams [[obedience]]; the divell to enflame the
ambition of the woman, to whom that fruit already seemed beautifull,
told her that by tasting it, they should be as gods, knowing [[good]] and
evill. whereupon having both eaten, they did indeed take upon them
gods office, which is judicature of [[good]] and evill; but acquired no new
ability to distinguish between them aright. and whereas it is sayd, that
having eaten, they saw they were naked; no [[man]] hath so interpreted that
place, as if they had formerly blind, as saw not their own skins: the
meaning is plain, that it was then they first judged their nakednesse
(wherein it was gods will to create them) to be uncomely; and by being
ashamed, did tacitely censure [[god]] himselfe. and thereupon [[god]] saith,
"hast thou eaten, &c." as if he should say, doest thou that owest me
obedience, take upon thee to [[judge]] of my commandements? whereby it is
cleerly, (though allegorically,) signified, that the commands of
them that have the [[right]] to command, are not by their subjects [[subject]] to be
censured, nor disputed.




soveraign [[power]] ought in all common-wealths to be absolute

so it appeareth plainly, to my understanding, both from [[reason]], and
scripture, that the soveraign [[power]], whether placed in one [[man]], as in
monarchy, or in one assembly of [[men]], as in popular, and aristocraticall
common-wealths, is as [[great]], as possibly [[men]] can be imagined to make
it. and though of so unlimited a [[power]], [[men]] may fancy many evill
consequences, yet the consequences of the want of it, which is
perpetuall warre of every [[man]] against his neighbour, are much worse. the
condition of [[man]] in this [[life]] shall never be without inconveniences; but
there happeneth in no common-wealth any [[great]] inconvenience, but what
proceeds from the subjects [[subject]] disobedience, and breach of those covenants,
from which the common-wealth had its being. and whosoever thinking
soveraign [[power]] too [[great]], will seek to make it lesse; must subject
himselfe, to the [[power]], that can limit it; that is to say, to a greater.

the [[greatest]] objection is, that of the practise; when [[men]] ask, where,
and when, such [[power]] has by subjects [[subject]] been acknowledged. but one may
ask them again, when, or where has there been a kingdome long [[free]] from
sedition and civill warre. in those nations, whose common-wealths have
been long-lived, and not been destroyed, but by forraign warre, the
subjects never did dispute of the soveraign [[power]]. but howsoever, an
argument for the practise of [[men]], that have not sifted to the bottom,
and with exact [[reason]] weighed the causes, and [[nature]] of common-wealths,
and suffer daily those miseries, that proceed from the ignorance
thereof, is invalid. for though in all places of the [[world]], [[men]] should
lay the foundation of their houses on the sand, it could not thence be
inferred, that so it ought to be. the [[skill]] of making, and maintaining
common-wealths, consisteth in [[certain]] rules [[rule]], as doth arithmetique and
geometry; not (as tennis-play) on practise onely: which rules [[rule]], neither
poor [[men]] have the leisure, nor [[men]] that have had the leisure, have
hitherto had the curiosity, or the method to find out.



chapter xxi. of the [[liberty]] of subjects




liberty what

liberty, or freedome, signifieth (properly) the absence of opposition;
(by opposition, i mean externall impediments of motion;) and may
be applyed no lesse to irrational, and inanimate creatures, than to
rationall. for whatsoever is so tyed, or environed, as it cannot move,
but within a [[certain]] space, which space is determined by the opposition
of some externall [[body]], we say it hath not [[liberty]] to go further. and
so of all living creatures, whilest they are imprisoned, or restrained,
with walls, or chayns; and of the water whilest it is kept in by banks,
or vessels, that otherwise would spread it selfe into a larger space, we
use to say, they are not at [[liberty]], to move in such manner, as without
those externall impediments they would. but when the impediment of
motion, is in the [[constitution]] of the thing it selfe, we use not to
say, it wants the [[liberty]]; but the [[power]] to move; as when a stone lyeth
still, or a [[man]] is fastned to his bed by sicknesse.




what it is to be free

and according to this proper, and generally received meaning of the
word, a free-man, is "he, that in those things, which by his strength
and wit he is able to do, is not hindred to doe what he has a will
to." but when the words [[free]], and [[liberty]], are applyed to any thing but
bodies, they are abused; for that which is not [[subject]] to motion, is not
subject to impediment: and therefore, when ’tis said (for example) the
way is [[free]], no [[liberty]] of the way is signified, but of those that walk
in it without stop. and when we say a guift is [[free]], there is not meant
any [[liberty]] of the guift, but of the giver, that was not bound by any
law, or covenant to give it. so when we speak freely, it is not the
liberty of voice, or pronunciation, but of the [[man]], whom no [[law]] hath
obliged to speak otherwise then he did. lastly, from the use of the
word freewill, no [[liberty]] can be inferred to the will, [[desire]], or
inclination, but the [[liberty]] of the [[man]]; which consisteth in this, that
he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, [[desire]], or inclination
to doe.




feare and [[liberty]] consistent

feare and [[liberty]] are consistent; as when a [[man]] throweth his goods [[good]] into
the sea for feare the ship should sink, he doth it neverthelesse very
willingly, and may refuse to doe it if he will: it is therefore the
action, of one that was [[free]]; so a [[man]] sometimes pays [[pay]] his debt, only for
feare of imprisonment, which because no [[body]] hindred him from detaining,
was the action of a [[man]] at [[liberty]]. and generally all actions which men
doe in common-wealths, for feare of the [[law]], or actions, which the doers
had [[liberty]] to omit.




liberty and necessity consistent

liberty and necessity are consistent: as in the water, that hath not
only [[liberty]], but a necessity of descending by the channel: so likewise
in the actions which [[men]] voluntarily doe; which (because they proceed
from their will) proceed from [[liberty]]; and yet because every act of
mans will, and every [[desire]], and inclination proceedeth from some cause,
which causes in a continuall chaine (whose first link in the hand of
god the first of all causes) proceed from necessity. so that to him
that could see the connexion of those causes, the necessity of all
mens voluntary actions, would appeare manifest. and therefore [[god]], that
seeth, and disposeth all things, seeth also that the [[liberty]] of man
in doing what he will, is accompanied with the necessity of doing that
which [[god]] will, & no more, nor lesse. for though [[men]] may do many things,
which [[god]] does not command, nor is therefore author of them; yet they
can have no passion, nor appetite to any thing, of which appetite gods
will is not the cause. and did not his will assure the necessity of mans
will, and consequently of all that on mans [[man]] will dependeth, the liberty
of [[men]] would be a contradiction, and impediment to the omnipotence and
liberty of [[god]]. and this shall suffice, (as to the matter in hand) of
that naturall [[liberty]], which only is properly called [[liberty]].




artificiall bonds, or covenants

but as [[men]], for the atteyning of [[peace]], and conservation of themselves
thereby, have made an artificiall [[man]], which we call a common-wealth; so
also have they made artificiall chains, called civill lawes, which they
themselves, by mutuall covenants, have fastned at one end, to the lips
of that [[man]], or assembly, to whom they have given the soveraigne [[power]];
and at the other end to their own ears. these bonds in their own nature
but [[weak]], may neverthelesse be made to hold, by the danger, though not
by the difficulty of breaking them.




liberty of subjects [[subject]] consisteth in [[liberty]] from covenants

in relation to these bonds only it is, that i am to speak now, of the
liberty of subjects [[subject]]. for seeing there is no common-wealth in the [[world]],
for the regulating of all the actions, and words of [[men]], (as being
a thing impossible:) it followeth necessarily, that in all kinds [[kind]] of
actions, by the laws [[law]] praetermitted, [[men]] have the [[liberty]], of doing what
their own reasons [[reason]] shall suggest, for the most profitable to themselves.
for if wee take [[liberty]] in the proper sense, for corporall [[liberty]]; that
is to say, freedome from chains, and prison, it were very absurd for men
to clamor as they doe, for the [[liberty]] they so manifestly enjoy. againe,
if we take [[liberty]], for an exemption from lawes, it is no lesse absurd,
for [[men]] to demand as they doe, that [[liberty]], by which all other [[men]] may
be masters of their lives [[life]]. and yet as absurd as it is, this is it they
demand; not knowing that the lawes are of no [[power]] to [[protect]] them,
without a [[sword]] in the hands of a [[man]], or [[men]], to cause those laws [[law]] to
be put in execution. the [[liberty]] of a [[subject]], lyeth therefore only
in those things, which in regulating their actions, the soveraign hath
praetermitted; such as is the [[liberty]] to buy, and sell, and otherwise
contract with one another; to choose their own aboad, their own diet,
their own [[trade]] of [[life]], and institute their [[children]] as they themselves
think fit; & the like.




liberty of the [[subject]] consistent with unlimited [[power]] of the soveraign

neverthelesse we are not to [[understand]], that by such [[liberty]], the
soveraign [[power]] of [[life]], and [[death]], is either abolished, or limited. for
it has been already shewn, that nothing the soveraign representative
can doe to a [[subject]], on what pretence soever, can properly be called
injustice, or injury; because every [[subject]] is author of every act the
soveraign doth; so that he never wanteth [[right]] to any thing, otherwise,
than as he himself is the [[subject]] of [[god]], and bound thereby to observe
the laws [[law]] of [[nature]]. and therefore it may, and doth often happen in
common-wealths, that a [[subject]] may be put to [[death]], by the command of
the soveraign [[power]]; and yet neither doe the other [[wrong]]: as when jeptha
caused his [[daughter]] to be sacrificed: in which, and the like cases,
he that so dieth, had [[liberty]] to doe the action, for which he is
neverthelesse, without injury put to [[death]]. and the same holdeth also
in a soveraign [[prince]], that putteth to [[death]] an [[innocent]] [[subject]]. for
though the action be against the [[law]] of [[nature]], as being contrary to
equitie, (as was the killing of uriah, by [[david]];) yet it was not an
injurie to uriah; but to [[god]]. not to uriah, because the [[right]] to doe
what he pleased, was given him by uriah himself; and yet to [[god]], because
david was gods [[subject]]; and prohibited all iniquitie by the [[law]] of
nature. which distinction, [[david]] himself, when he repented the [[fact]],
evidently confirmed, saying, "to thee only have i sinned." in the same
manner, the [[people]] of [[athens]], when they [[banished]] the most potent of
their common-wealth for ten years, [[thought]] they committed no [[injustice]];
and yet they never questioned what crime he had done; but what hurt he
would doe: nay they commanded the [[banishment]] of they knew not whom; and
every citizen bringing his oystershell into the market place, written
with the name of him he [[desired]] should be [[banished]], without actuall
accusing him, sometimes [[banished]] an aristides, for his [[reputation]] of
justice; and sometimes a scurrilous jester, as hyperbolus, to make a
jest of it. and yet a [[man]] cannot say, the soveraign [[people]] of athens
wanted [[right]] to banish them; or an athenian the libertie to jest, or to
be just.




the [[liberty]] which writers [[praise]], is the [[liberty]] of soveraigns; not of
private men

the libertie, whereof there is so frequent, and honourable mention, in
the histories [[history]], and [[philosophy]] of the antient greeks [[greek]], and romans, and in
the writings, and discourse of those that from them have received all
their learning in the politiques, is not the libertie of particular
men; but the libertie of the common-wealth: which is the same with
that, which every [[man]] then should have, if there were no civil laws [[law]],
nor common-wealth at all. and the effects of it also be the same. for as
amongst masterlesse [[men]], there is perpetuall [[war]], of every [[man]] against
his neighbour; no [[inheritance]], to transmit to the [[son]], nor to expect
from the [[father]]; no propriety of goods [[good]], or lands [[land]]; no security; but a
full and absolute libertie in every particular [[man]]: so in states, and
common-wealths not dependent on one another, every common-wealth, (not
every man) has an absolute libertie, to doe what it shall [[judge]] (that is
to say, what that [[man]], or assemblie that representeth it, shall judge)
most conducing to their benefit. but withall, they [[live]] in the condition
of a perpetuall [[war]], and upon the confines of battel, with their
frontiers armed, and canons planted against their neighbours
round about. the athenians, and romanes, were [[free]]; that is, free
common-wealths: not that any particular [[men]] had the libertie to resist
their own representative; but that their representative had the libertie
to resist, or invade other [[people]]. there is written on the turrets of
the [[city]] of luca in [[great]] characters [[character]] at this day, the word libertas; yet
no [[man]] can thence inferre, that a particular [[man]] has more libertie,
or immunitie from the service of the commonwealth there, than in
constantinople. whether a common-wealth be monarchicall, or popular, the
freedome is still the same.

but it is an easy thing, for [[men]] to be deceived, by the specious name
of libertie; and for want of judgement to distinguish, mistake that for
their private [[inheritance]], and birth [[right]], which is the [[right]] of the
publique only. and when the same errour is confirmed by the [[authority]] of
men in [[reputation]] for their writings in this [[subject]], it is no wonder if
it [[produce]] sedition, and [[change]] of [[government]]. in these westerne
parts of the [[world]], we are made to receive our opinions [[opinion]] concerning the
institution, and rights [[right]] of common-wealths, from [[aristotle]], cicero, and
other [[men]], greeks [[greek]] and romanes, that living under popular states, derived
those rights [[right]], not from the principles [[principle]] of [[nature]], but transcribed them
into their books [[book]], out of the practice of their own common-wealths, which
were popular; as the grammarians describe the rules [[rule]] of [[language]], out of
the practise of the [[time]]; or the rules [[rule]] of poetry, out of the poems of
homer and [[virgil]]. and because the athenians were taught, (to keep them
from [[desire]] of changing their [[government]],) that they were freemen, and
all that lived under [[monarchy]] were slaves [[slave]]; therefore [[aristotle]] puts it
down in his politiques,(lib.6.cap.2) "in [[democracy]], [[liberty]] is to be
supposed: for ’tis commonly held, that no [[man]] is [[free]] in any other
government." and as [[aristotle]]; so cicero, and other writers have
grounded their civill doctrine, on the opinions [[opinion]] of the romans, who were
taught to hate [[monarchy]], at first, by them that having deposed their
soveraign, shared amongst them the soveraignty of [[rome]]; and afterwards
by their successors. and by reading of these [[greek]], and latine authors,
men from their [[childhood]] have gotten a habit (under a false shew of
liberty,) of favouring tumults, and of licentious controlling the
actions of their soveraigns; and again of controlling those controllers,
with the effusion of so much [[blood]]; as i [[think]] i may truly say, there
was never any thing so deerly bought, as these western parts have bought
the learning of the [[greek]] and latine tongues.




liberty of the [[subject]] how to be measured

to come now to the particulars of the true [[liberty]] of a [[subject]]; that is
to say, what are the things, which though commanded by the soveraign, he
may neverthelesse, without [[injustice]], refuse to do; we are to consider,
what rights [[right]] we passe away, when we make a common-wealth; or (which is
all one,) what [[liberty]] we deny our selves, by owning all the actions
(without exception) of the [[man]], or assembly we make our soveraign. for
in the act of our submission, consisteth both our obligation, and
our [[liberty]]; which must therefore be inferred by arguments taken from
thence; there being no obligation on any [[man]], which ariseth not from
some act of his own; for all [[men]] equally, are by [[nature]] [[free]]. and
because such arguments, must either be drawn from the expresse words, "i
authorise all his actions," or from the intention of him that submitteth
himselfe to his [[power]], (which intention is to be understood by the end
for which he so submitteth;) the obligation, and [[liberty]] of the [[subject]],
is to be derived, either from those words, (or others equivalent;) or
else from the end of the institution of soveraignty; namely, the peace
of the subjects [[subject]] within themselves, and their defence against a common
enemy.




subjects have [[liberty]] to defend their own bodies [[body]], even against them
that lawfully invade them

first therefore, seeing soveraignty by institution, is by covenant of
every one to every one; and soveraignty by acquisition, by covenants of
the vanquished to the victor, or child to the parent; it is manifest,
that every [[subject]] has [[liberty]] in all those things, the [[right]] whereof
cannot by covenant be transferred. i have shewn before in the 14.
chapter, that covenants, not to defend a mans [[man]] own [[body]], are voyd.
therefore,




are not bound to hurt themselves;

if the soveraign command a [[man]] (though justly condemned,) to kill,
wound, or mayme himselfe; or not to resist those that assault him; or
to abstain from the use of food, ayre, medicine, or any other thing,
without which he cannot [[live]]; yet hath that [[man]] the [[liberty]] to disobey.

if a [[man]] be interrogated by the soveraign, or his [[authority]], concerning
a crime done by himselfe, he is not bound (without assurance of pardon)
to confesse it; because no [[man]] (as i have shewn in the same chapter) can
be obliged by covenant to accuse himselfe.

again, the [[consent]] of a [[subject]] to soveraign [[power]], is contained in
these words, "i authorise, or take upon me, all his actions;" in which
there is no restriction at all, of his own former naturall [[liberty]]:
for by allowing him to kill me, i am not bound to kill my selfe when
he commands me. "’tis one thing to say ‘kill me, or my fellow, if you
please;’ another thing to say, ‘i will kill my selfe, or my fellow.’" it
followeth therefore, that

no [[man]] is bound by the words themselves, either to kill himselfe, or
any other [[man]]; and consequently, that the obligation a [[man]] may sometimes
have, upon the command of the soveraign to execute any dangerous, or
dishonourable office, dependeth not on the words of our submission; but
on the intention; which is to be understood by the end thereof. when
therefore our refusall to obey, frustrates the end for which the
soveraignty was ordained; then there is no [[liberty]] to refuse: otherwise
there is.




nor to warfare, unless they voluntarily undertake it

upon this ground, a [[man]] that is commanded as a souldier to [[fight]] against
the [[enemy]], though his soveraign have [[right]] enough to punish his refusall
with [[death]], may neverthelesse in many cases refuse, without [[injustice]];
as when he substituteth a sufficient souldier in his place: for in this
case he deserteth not the service of the common-wealth. and there is
allowance to be made for naturall timorousnesse, not onely to [[women]], (of
whom no such dangerous [[duty]] is expected,) but also to [[men]] of feminine
courage. when armies [[army]] [[fight]], there is on one side, or both, a running
away; yet when they do it not out of trechery, but [[fear]], they are not
esteemed to do it unjustly, but dishonourably. for the same [[reason]], to
avoyd battell, is not [[injustice]], but cowardise. but he that inrowleth
himselfe a souldier, or taketh imprest mony, taketh away the excuse of
a timorous [[nature]]; and is obliged, not onely to go to the battell,
but also not to run from it, without his captaines leave. and when the
defence of the common-wealth, requireth at once the [[help]] of all that
are able to bear arms, every one is obliged; because otherwise the
institution of the common-wealth, which they have not the [[purpose]], or
courage to preserve, was in [[vain]].

to resist the [[sword]] of the common-wealth, in defence of another [[man]],
guilty, or [[innocent]], no [[man]] hath [[liberty]]; because such [[liberty]], takes
away from the soveraign, the means of protecting us; and is therefore
destructive of the very essence of [[government]]. but in case a [[great]] many
men together, have already resisted the soveraign [[power]] unjustly, or
committed some capitall crime, for which every one of them expecteth
death, whether have they not the [[liberty]] then to joyn together, and
assist, and defend one another? certainly they have: for they but defend
their lives [[life]], which the guilty [[man]] may as well do, as the [[innocent]]. there
was indeed [[injustice]] in the first breach of their [[duty]]; their bearing of
arms subsequent to it, though it be to maintain what they have done, is
no new [[unjust]] act. and if it be onely to defend their persons [[person]], it is not
unjust at all. but the offer of pardon taketh from them, to whom it
is offered, the plea of self-defence, and maketh their perseverance in
assisting, or defending the rest, unlawfull.




the [[greatest]] [[liberty]] of subjects [[subject]], dependeth on the [[silence]] of the law


as for other lyberties, they depend on the [[silence]] of the [[law]]. in cases
where the soveraign has prescribed no [[rule]], there the [[subject]] hath
the [[liberty]] to do, or forbeare, according to his own discretion. and
therefore such [[liberty]] is in some places more, and in some lesse; and in
some times [[time]] more, in other times [[time]] lesse, according as they that have the
soveraignty shall [[think]] most convenient. as for [[example]], there was
a [[time]], when in [[england]] a [[man]] might enter in to his own [[land]],
(and dispossesse such as wrongfully possessed it) by [[force]]. but in
after-times, that [[liberty]] of forcible entry, was taken away by a statute
made (by the king) in [[parliament]]. and is some places of the [[world]], men
have the [[liberty]] of many wives [[wife]]: in other places, such [[liberty]] is not
allowed.

if a [[subject]] have a controversie with his soveraigne, of debt, or
of [[right]] of possession of lands [[land]] or goods [[good]], or concerning any service
required at his hands, or concerning any penalty corporall, or
pecuniary, grounded on a precedent [[law]]; he hath the same [[liberty]] to sue
for his [[right]], as if it were against a [[subject]]; and before such judges [[judge]],
as are appointed by the soveraign. for seeing the soveraign demandeth
by [[force]] of a former [[law]], and not by vertue of his [[power]]; he declareth
thereby, that he requireth no more, than shall appear to be due by that
law. the sute therefore is not contrary to the will of the soveraign;
and consequently the [[subject]] hath the [[liberty]] to demand the hearing of
his cause; and sentence, according to that [[law]]. but if he demand, or
take any thing by pretence of his [[power]]; there lyeth, in that case, no
action of [[law]]: for all that is done by him in vertue of his [[power]], is
done by the [[authority]] of every [[subject]], and consequently, he that brings
an action against the soveraign, brings it against himselfe.

if a monarch, or soveraign assembly, grant a [[liberty]] to all, or any of
his subjects [[subject]]; which grant standing, he is disabled to provide for their
safety, the grant is voyd; unlesse he directly renounce, or transferre
the soveraignty to another. for in that he might openly, (if it had been
his will,) and in plain termes, have renounced, or transferred it, and
did not; it is to be understood it was not his will; but that the grant
proceeded from ignorance of the repugnancy between such a [[liberty]] and
the soveraign [[power]]; and therefore the soveraignty is still retayned;
and consequently all those powers [[power]], which are necessary to the exercising
thereof; such as are the [[power]] of warre, and [[peace]], of judicature, of
appointing officers, and councellours, of levying mony, and the rest
named in the 18th [[chapter]].




in what cases subjects [[subject]] absolved of their [[obedience]] to their soveraign

the obligation of subjects [[subject]] to the soveraign is understood to [[last]] as
long, and no longer, than the [[power]] lasteth, by which he is able to
protect them. for the [[right]] [[men]] have by [[nature]] to [[protect]] themselves,
when none else can [[protect]] them, can by no covenant be relinquished. the
soveraignty is the soule of the common-wealth; which once departed from
the [[body]], the members doe no more receive their motion from it. the end
of [[obedience]] is protection; which, wheresoever a [[man]] seeth it, either in
his own, or in anothers [[sword]], [[nature]] applyeth his [[obedience]] to it, and
his endeavour to maintaine it. and though soveraignty, in the intention
of them that make it, be immortall; yet is it in its own [[nature]], not
only [[subject]] to [[violent]] [[death]], by forreign [[war]]; but also through
the ignorance, and [[passions]] of [[men]], it hath in it, from the very
institution, many seeds of a naturall [[mortality]], by intestine discord.




in case of captivity

if a [[subject]] be taken [[prisoner]] in [[war]]; or his [[person]], or his means of
life be within the guards of the [[enemy]], and hath his [[life]] and corporall
libertie given him, on condition to be [[subject]] to the victor, he hath
libertie to accept the condition; and having accepted it, is the subject
of him that took him; because he had no other way to preserve himselfe.
the case is the same, if he be deteined on the same termes, in a
forreign [[country]]. but if a [[man]] be held in prison, or bonds, or is not
trusted with the libertie of his bodie; he cannot be understood to be
bound by covenant to subjection; and therefore may, if he can, make his
escape by any means whatsoever.




in case the soveraign cast off the [[government]] from himself and heyrs

if a monarch shall relinquish the soveraignty, both for himself, and
his heires; his subjects [[subject]] returne to the absolute libertie of [[nature]];
because, though [[nature]] may declare who are his sons [[son]], and who are the
nerest of his kin; yet it dependeth on his own will, (as hath been said
in the precedent [[chapter]],) who shall be his heyr. if therefore he will
have no heyre, there is no soveraignty, nor subjection. the case is the
same, if he dye without known kindred, and without declaration of
his heyre. for then there can no heire be known, and consequently no
subjection be due.




in case of banishment

if the soveraign banish his [[subject]]; during the [[banishment]], he is not
subject. but he that is sent on a message, or hath leave to travell, is
still [[subject]]; but it is, by contract between soveraigns, not by vertue
of the covenant of subjection. for whosoever entreth into anothers
dominion, is [[subject]] to all the lawes thereof; unless he have a
privilege by the amity of the soveraigns, or by speciall licence.




in case the soveraign render himself [[subject]] to another

if a monarch subdued by [[war]], render himself [[subject]] to the victor; his
subjects are delivered from their former obligation, and become obliged
to the victor. but if he be held [[prisoner]], or have not the liberty
of his own [[body]]; he is not understood to have given away the [[right]] of
soveraigntie; and therefore his subjects [[subject]] are obliged to yield obedience
to the magistrates formerly placed, governing not in their own name,
but in his. for, his [[right]] remaining, the [[question]] is only of the
administration; that is to say, of the magistrates and officers; which,
if he have not means to name, he is supposed to approve those, which he
himself had formerly appointed.



chapter xxii. of systemes [[subject]], politicall, and private




the divers sorts of systemes of people

having spoken of the [[generation]], forme, and [[power]] of a common-wealth, i
am in order to speak next of the parts thereof. and first of systemes,
which resemble the similar parts, or muscles of a [[body]] naturall. by
systemes; i [[understand]] any numbers of [[men]] joyned in one interest, or one
businesse. of which, some are regular, and some irregular. regular are
those, where one [[man]], or assembly of [[men]], is constituted representative
of the whole number. all other are irregular.

of regular, some are absolute, and independent, [[subject]] to none but
their own representative: such are only common-wealths; of which i have
spoken already in the 5. [[last]] preceding chapters [[chapter]]. others are dependent;
that is to say, subordinate to some soveraign [[power]], to which every one,
as also their representative is [[subject]].

of systemes subordinate, some are politicall, and some private.
politicall (otherwise called bodies [[body]] politique, and persons [[person]] in [[law]],)
are those, which are made by [[authority]] from the soveraign [[power]] of the
common-wealth. private, are those, which are constituted by subjects
amongst themselves, or by authoritie from a stranger. for no authority
derived from forraign [[power]], within the dominion of another, is publique
there, but private.

and of private systemes, some are lawfull; some unlawfull: lawfull, are
those which are allowed by the common-wealth: all other are unlawfull.
irregular systemes, are those which having no representative,
consist only in concourse of [[people]]; which if not forbidden by the
common-wealth, nor made on evill designe, (such as are conflux of people
to markets, or shews, or any other harmelesse end,) are lawfull. but
when the intention is evill, or (if the number be considerable) unknown,
they are unlawfull.




in all bodies [[body]] politique the [[power]] of the representative is limited

in bodies [[body]] politique, the [[power]] of the representative is alwaies limited:
and that which prescribeth the limits thereof, is the [[power]] soveraign.
for [[power]] unlimited, is absolute soveraignty. and the soveraign, in
every commonwealth, is the absolute representative of all the subjects [[subject]];
and therefore no other, can be representative of any part of them,
but so far forth, as he shall give leave; and to give leave to a body
politique of subjects [[subject]], to have an absolute representative to all
intents and purposes [[purpose]], were to abandon the [[government]] of so much of the
commonwealth, and to divide the dominion, contrary to their [[peace]] and
defence, which the soveraign cannot be understood to doe, by any grant,
that does not plainly, and directly discharge them of their subjection.
for consequences of words, are not the signes of his will, when other
consequences are signes of the contrary; but rather signes of errour,
and misreckoning; to which all [[mankind]] is too prone.

the bounds of that [[power]], which is given to the representative of a
bodie politique, are to be taken notice of, from two things. one is
their writt, or letters from the soveraign: the other is the [[law]] of the
common-wealth.




by letters patents

for though in the institution or acquisition of a common-wealth,
which is independent, there needs no writing, because the [[power]] of the
representative has there no other bounds, but such as are set out by
the unwritten [[law]] of [[nature]]; yet in subordinate bodies [[body]], there are such
diversities of limitation necessary, concerning their businesses, times [[time]],
and places, as can neither be remembred without letters, nor taken
notice of, unlesse such letters be patent, that they may be [[read]] to
them, and withall sealed, or testified, with the seales, or other
permanent signes of the [[authority]] soveraign.




and the lawes

and because such limitation is not alwaies easie, or perhaps possible
to be described in writing; the ordinary lawes, [[common]] to all subjects [[subject]],
must determine, that the representative may lawfully do, in all cases,
where the letters themselves are silent. and therefore




when the representative is one [[man]], his unwarranted acts his own onely

in a [[body]] politique, if the representative be one [[man]], whatsoever he
does in the [[person]] of the [[body]], which is not warranted in his letters,
nor by the lawes, is his own act, and not the act of the [[body]], nor of
any other member thereof besides himselfe: because further than his
letters, or the lawes limit, he representeth no mans [[man]] [[person]], but his
own. but what he does according to these, is the act of every one: for
of the act of the soveraign every one is author, because he is their
representative unlimited; and the act of him that recedes not from the
letters of the soveraign, is the act of the soveraign, and therefore
every member of the [[body]] is author of it.




when it is an assembly, it is the act of them that assented onely

but if the representative be an assembly, whatsoever that assembly shall
decree, not warranted by their letters, or the lawes, is the act of the
assembly, or [[body]] politique, and the act of every one by whose vote the
decree was made; but not the act of any [[man]] that being [[present]] voted to
the contrary; nor of any [[man]] absent, unlesse he voted it by procuration.
it is the act of the assembly, because voted by the major part; and if
it be a crime, the assembly may be punished, as farre-forth as it is
capable, as by dissolution, or forfeiture of their letters (which is to
such artificiall, and fictitious bodies [[body]], capitall,) or (if the
assembly have a [[common]] stock, wherein none of the [[innocent]] members have
propriety,) by pecuniary mulct. for from corporall penalties [[nature]] hath
exempted all bodies [[body]] politique. but they that gave not their vote, are
therefore [[innocent]], because the assembly cannot represent any [[man]] in
things unwarranted by their letters, and consequently are not involved
in their votes.

when the representative is one [[man]], if he borrow mony, or owe it, by
contract; he is lyable onely, the members not if the [[person]] of the body
politique being in one [[man]], borrow mony of a stranger, that is, of one
that is not of the same [[body]], (for no letters need limit borrowing,
seeing it is left to mens [[men]] own inclinations to limit lending) the debt is
the representatives. for if he should have [[authority]] from his letters,
to make the members [[pay]] what he borroweth, he should have by consequence
the soveraignty of them; and therefore the grant were either voyd,
as proceeding from errour, commonly incident to humane [[nature]], and an
unsufficient signe of the will of the granter; or if it be avowed
by him, then is the representer soveraign, and falleth not under the
present [[question]], which is onely of bodies [[body]] subordinate. no member
therefore is obliged to [[pay]] the debt so borrowed, but the representative
himselfe: because he that lendeth it, being a stranger to the letters,
and to the qualification of the [[body]], understandeth those onely for
his debtors, that are engaged; and seeing the representer can ingage
himselfe, and none else, has him onely for debtor; who must therefore
pay him, out of the [[common]] stock (if there be any), or (if there be
none) out of his own estate.

if he come into debt by contract, or mulct, the case is the same.




when it is an assembly, they onely are liable that have assented

but when the representative is an assembly, and the debt to a stranger;
all they, and onely they are responsible for the debt, that gave their
votes to the borrowing of it, or to the contract that made it due, or to
the [[fact]] for which the mulct was imposed; because every one of those in
voting did engage himselfe for the payment: for he that is author of
the borrowing, is obliged to the payment, even of the whole debt, though
when payd by any one, he be discharged.




if the debt be to one of the assembly, the [[body]] onely is obliged

but if the debt be to one of the assembly, the assembly onely is obliged
to the payment, out of their [[common]] stock (if they have any:) for having
liberty of vote, if he vote the mony, shall be borrowed, he votes it
shall be payd; if he vote it shall not be borrowed, or be absent, yet
because in lending, he voteth the borrowing, he contradicteth his former
vote, and is obliged by the later, and becomes both borrower and lender,
and consequently cannot demand payment from any particular [[man]], but
from the [[common]] treasure onely; which fayling he hath no remedy, nor
complaint, but against himselfe, that being privy to the acts of
the assembly, and their means to [[pay]], and not being enforced, did
neverthelesse through his own folly lend his mony.




protestation against the decrees of bodies [[body]] politique

sometimes lawful; but against soveraign [[power]] never it is manifest by
this, that in bodies [[body]] politique subordinate, and [[subject]] to a soveraign
power, it is sometimes not onely lawfull, but expedient, for a
particular [[man]] to make open protestation against the decrees of the
representative assembly, and cause their dissent to be registred, or to
take witnesse of it; because otherwise they may be obliged to [[pay]] debts
contracted, and be responsible for crimes committed by other [[men]]: but in
a soveraign assembly, that [[liberty]] is taken away, both because he that
protesteth there, denies their soveraignty; and also because whatsoever
is commanded by the soveraign [[power]], is as to the [[subject]] (though not
so alwayes in the sight of god) justified by the command; for of such
command every [[subject]] is the author.




bodies politique for [[government]] of a province, colony, or town

the variety of bodies [[body]] politique, is almost infinite; for they are
not onely distinguished by the severall affaires, for which they are
constituted, wherein there is an unspeakable diversitie; but also by the
times, places, and numbers, [[subject]] to many limitations. and as to their
affaires, some are ordained for [[government]]; as first, the government
of a province may be committed to an assembly of [[men]], wherein all
resolutions shall depend on the votes of the major part; and then this
assembly is a [[body]] politique, and their [[power]] limited by commission.
this word province signifies a charge, or [[care]] of businesse, which he
whose businesse it is, committeth to another [[man]], to be administred for,
and under him; and therefore when in one common-wealth there be divers
countries, that have their lawes distinct one from another, or are farre
distant in place, the administration of the [[government]] being committed
to divers persons [[person]], those countries [[country]] where the soveraign is not resident,
but governs by commission, are called provinces. but of the government
of a province, by an assembly residing in the province it selfe, there
be few examples [[example]]. the romans who had the soveraignty of many provinces;
yet governed them alwaies by presidents, and praetors; and not by
assemblies, as they governed the [[city]] of [[rome]], and territories adjacent.
in like manner, when there were colonies sent from [[england]], to plant
virginia, and sommer-ilands; though the [[government]] of them here, were
committed to assemblies in [[london]], yet did those assemblies never
commit the [[government]] under them to any assembly there; but did to each
plantation send one governour; for though every [[man]], where he can be
present by [[nature]], desires [[desire]] to participate of [[government]]; yet where
they cannot be [[present]], they are by [[nature]] also enclined, to commit the
government of their [[common]] interest rather to a monarchicall, then a
popular form of [[government]]: which is also evident in those [[men]] that have
great private estates; who when they are unwilling to take the paines of
administring the businesse that belongs to them, choose rather to trust
one servant, than a assembly either of their [[friends]] or servants.
but howsoever it be in [[fact]], yet we may suppose the [[government]] of a
province, or colony committed to an assembly: and when it is, that which
in this place i have to say, is this; that whatsoever debt is by that
assembly contracted; or whatsoever unlawfull act is decreed, is the act
onely of those that assented, and not of any that dissented, or were
absent, for the reasons [[reason]] before alledged. also that an assembly residing
out of the bounds of that colony whereof they have the [[government]],
cannot execute any [[power]] over the persons [[person]], or goods [[good]] of any of the
colonie, to seize on them for debt, or other [[duty]], in any place
without the colony it selfe, as having no jurisdiction, nor authoritie
elsewhere, but are left to the remedie, which the [[law]] of the place
alloweth them. and though the assembly have [[right]], to impose a mulct
upon any of their members, that shall break the lawes they make; yet
out of the colonie it selfe, they have no [[right]] to execute the same.
and that which is said here, of the rights [[right]] of an assembly, for the
government of a province, or a colony, is appliable also to an assembly
for the [[government]] of a town, or [[university]], or a college, or a [[church]],
or for any other [[government]] over the persons [[person]] of [[men]].

and generally, in all bodies [[body]] politique, if any particular member
conceive himself injured by the [[body]] it [[self]], the cognisance of his
cause belongeth to the soveraign, and those the soveraign hath ordained
for judges [[judge]] in such causes, or shall ordaine for that particular cause;
and not to the [[body]] it [[self]]. for the whole [[body]] is in this case his
fellow [[subject]], which in a soveraign assembly, is otherwise: for there,
if the soveraign be not [[judge]], though in his own cause, there can be no
judge at all.




bodies politique for ordering of trade

in a bodie politique, for the well ordering of forraigne traffique, the
most commodious representative is an assembly of all the members; that
is to say, such a one, as every one that adventureth his mony, may be
present at all the deliberations, and resolutions of the [[body]], if they
will themselves. for proof whereof, we are to consider the end, for
which [[men]] that are merchants, and may buy and sell, export, and import
their merchandise, according to their own discretions, doe neverthelesse
bind themselves up in one corporation. it is true, there be few
merchants, that with the merchandise they buy at [[home]], can fraight a
ship, to export it; or with that they buy abroad, to bring it [[home]]; and
have therefore need to joyn together in one [[society]]; where every man
may either participate of the gaine, according to the proportion of his
adventure; or take his own; and sell what he transports, or imports, at
such prices as he thinks [[think]] fit. but this is no [[body]] politique, there being
no [[common]] representative to oblige them to any other [[law]], than that
which is [[common]] to all other subjects [[subject]]. the end of their incorporating,
is to make their gaine the greater; which is done two wayes; by sole
buying, and sole selling, both at [[home]], and abroad. so that to grant
to a company of merchants to be a corporation, or [[body]] politique, is to
grant them a double [[monopoly]], whereof one is to be sole buyers; another
to be sole sellers. for when there is a company incorporate for any
particular forraign [[country]], they only export the commodities vendible
in that [[country]]; which is sole buying at [[home]], and sole selling abroad.
for at [[home]] there is but one buyer, and abroad but one that selleth:
both which is gainfull to the merchant, because thereby they buy at home
at lower, and sell abroad at higher rates: and abroad there is but one
buyer of forraign merchandise, and but one that sels them at [[home]]; both
which againe are gainfull to the adventurers.

of this double [[monopoly]] one part is disadvantageous to the [[people]] at
home, the other to forraigners. for at [[home]] by their sole exportation
they set what price they please on the husbandry and handy-works of
the [[people]]; and by the sole importation, what price they please on all
forraign commodities the [[people]] have need of; both which are ill for the
people. on the contrary, by the sole selling of the native commodities
abroad, and sole buying the forraign commodities upon the place,
they raise the price of those, and abate the price of these, to
the disadvantage of the forraigner: for where but one selleth, the
merchandise is the dearer; and where but one buyeth the cheaper: such
corporations therefore are no other then monopolies; though they would
be very profitable for a common-wealth, if being bound up into one body
in forraigne markets they were at [[liberty]] at [[home]], every [[man]] to buy, and
sell at what price he could.

the end then of these bodies [[body]] of merchants, being not a [[common]] benefit
to the whole [[body]], (which have in this case no [[common]] stock, but what
is deducted out of the particular adventures, for building, buying,
victualling and manning of ships,) but the particular gaine of
every adventurer, it is [[reason]] that every one be acquainted with the
employment of his own; that is, that every one be of the assembly, that
shall have the [[power]] to order the same; and be acquainted with their
accounts. and therefore the representative of such a [[body]] must be
an assembly, where every member of the [[body]] may be [[present]] at the
consultations, if he will.

if a [[body]] politique of merchants, contract a debt to a stranger by the
act of their representative assembly, every member is lyable by himself
for the whole. for a stranger can take no notice of their private lawes,
but considereth them as so many particular [[men]], obliged every one to the
whole payment, till payment made by one dischargeth all the rest: but if
the debt be to one of the company, the creditor is debter for the whole
to himself, and cannot therefore demand his debt, but only from the
common stock, if there be any.

if the common-wealth impose a tax upon the [[body]], it is understood to be
layd upon every member proportionably to his particular adventure in the
company. for there is in this case no other [[common]] stock, but what is
made of their particular adventures.

if a mulct be layd upon the [[body]] for some unlawfull act, they only are
lyable by whose votes the act was decreed, or by whose assistance it was
executed; for in none of the rest is there any other crime but being
of the [[body]]; which if a crime, (because the [[body]] was ordeyned by the
authority of the common-wealth,) is not his.

if one of the members be indebted to the [[body]], he may be sued by the
body; but his goods [[good]] cannot be taken, nor his [[person]] imprisoned by the
authority of the [[body]]; but only by [[authority]] of the common-wealth:
for if they can doe it by their own [[authority]], they can by their own
authority give judgement that the debt is due, which is as much as to be
judge in their own cause.




a bodie politique for counsel to be give to the soveraign

these bodies [[body]] made for the [[government]] of [[men]], or of traffique, be either
perpetuall, or for a [[time]] prescribed by writing. but there be bodies
also whose times [[time]] are limited, and that only by the [[nature]] of their
businesse. for [[example]], if a soveraign monarch, or a soveraign assembly,
shall [[think]] fit to give command to the towns, and other severall parts
of their territory, to send to him their deputies, to enforme him of the
condition, and necessities of the subjects [[subject]], or to advise with him for
the making of [[good]] lawes, or for any other cause, as with one person
representing the whole [[country]], such deputies, having a place and time
of meeting assigned them, are there, and at that [[time]], a [[body]] politique,
representing every [[subject]] of that dominion; but it is onely for such
matters as shall be propounded unto them by that [[man]], or assembly, that
by the soveraign [[authority]] sent for them; and when it shall be declared
that nothing more shall be propounded, nor debated by them, the [[body]] is
dissolved. for if they were the absolute representative of the [[people]],
then were it the soveraign assembly; and so there would be two soveraign
assemblies, or two soveraigns, over the same [[people]]; which cannot
consist with their [[peace]]. and therefore where there is once a
soveraignty, there can be no absolute representation of the [[people]], but
by it. and for the limits of how farre such a [[body]] shall represent the
whole [[people]], they are set forth in the writing by which they were sent
for. for the [[people]] cannot choose their deputies to other intent, than
is in the writing directed to them from their soveraign expressed.




a regular private [[body]], lawfull, as a family

private bodies [[body]] regular, and lawfull, are those that are constituted
without letters, or other written [[authority]], saving the lawes common
to all other subjects [[subject]]. and because they be [[united]] in one person
representative, they are held for regular; such as are all families [[family]], in
which the [[father]], or master ordereth the whole [[family]]. for he obligeth
his [[children]], and servants, as farre as the [[law]] permitteth, though not
further, because none of them are bound to [[obedience]] in those actions,
which the [[law]] hath forbidden to be done. in all other actions, during
the [[time]] they are under domestique [[government]], they are [[subject]] to their
fathers, and masters, as to their immediate soveraigns. for the [[father]],
and master being before the institution of common-wealth, absolute
soveraigns in their own families [[family]], they lose afterward no more of their
authority, than the [[law]] of the common-wealth taketh from them.




private bodies [[body]] regular, but unlawfull

private bodies [[body]] regular, but unlawfull, are those that unite themselves
into one [[person]] representative, without any publique [[authority]] at all;
such as are the corporations of beggars, theeves and gipsies, the better
to order their [[trade]] of begging, and stealing; and the corporations of
men, that by [[authority]] from any forraign [[person]], unite themselves in
anothers dominion, for easier propagation of doctrines, and for making a
party, against the [[power]] of the common-wealth.




systemes irregular, such as are private leagues

irregular systemes, in their [[nature]], but leagues, or sometimes meer
concourse of [[people]], without union to any particular designe, not by
obligation of one to another, but proceeding onely from a similitude of
wills and inclinations, become lawfull, or unlawfull, according to the
lawfulnesse, or unlawfulnesse of every particular mans [[man]] design therein:
and his designe is to be understood by the [[occasion]].

the leagues of subjects [[subject]], (because leagues are commonly made for mutuall
defence,) are in a common-wealth (which is no more than a league of
all the subjects [[subject]] together) for the most part unnecessary, and savour of
unlawfull designe; and are for that cause unlawfull, and go commonly by
the name of factions, or conspiracies. for a league being a connexion of
men by covenants, if there be no [[power]] given to any one [[man]] or assembly,
(as in the condition of meer nature) to compell them to performance,
is so long onely valid, as there ariseth no just cause of distrust: and
therefore leagues between common-wealths, over whom there is no humane
power established, to keep them all in awe, are not onely lawfull, but
also profitable for the [[time]] they [[last]]. but leagues of the subjects [[subject]] of
one and the same common-wealth, where every one may obtain his right
by means of the soveraign [[power]], are unnecessary to the maintaining of
peace and [[justice]], and (in case the designe of them be evill, or unknown
to the common-wealth) unlawfull. for all uniting of [[strength]] by private
men, is, if for evill intent, [[unjust]]; if for intent unknown, dangerous
to the publique, and unjustly concealed.




secret cabals

if the soveraign [[power]] be in a [[great]] assembly, and a number of [[men]],
part of the assembly, without [[authority]], consult a part, to contrive
the guidance of the rest; this is a faction, or conspiracy unlawfull,
as being a fraudulent seducing of the assembly for their particular
interest. but if he, whose private interest is to be debated, and
judged in the assembly, make as many [[friends]] as he can; in him it is
no [[injustice]]; because in this case he is no part of the assembly. and
though he hire such [[friends]] with mony, (unlesse there be an expresse law
against it,) yet it is not [[injustice]]. for sometimes, (as mens [[men]] manners
are,) [[justice]] cannot be had without mony; and every [[man]] may [[think]] his
own cause just, till it be heard, and judged.




feuds of private families

in all common-wealths, if a private [[man]] entertain more servants, than
the [[government]] of his estate, and lawfull employment he has for them
requires, it is faction, and unlawfull. for having the protection of the
common-wealth, he needeth not the defence of private [[force]]. and whereas
in nations not throughly civilized, severall numerous families [[family]] have
lived in continuall hostility, and invaded one another with private
force; yet it is evident enough, that they have done unjustly; or else
that they had no common-wealth.




factions for government

and as factions for kindred, so also factions for [[government]] of
religion, as of papists, protestants, &c. or of [[state]], as patricians,
and plebeians of old [[time]] in [[rome]], and of aristocraticalls and
democraticalls of old [[time]] in greece, are [[unjust]], as being contrary to
the [[peace]] and safety of the [[people]], and a taking of the [[sword]] out of the
hand of the soveraign.

concourse of [[people]], is an irregular systeme, the lawfulnesse, or
unlawfulnesse, whereof dependeth on the [[occasion]], and on the number of
them that are assembled. if the [[occasion]] be lawfull, and manifest, the
concourse is lawfull; as the usuall meeting of [[men]] at [[church]], or at a
publique shew, in usuall numbers: for if the numbers be extraordinarily
great, the [[occasion]] is not evident; and consequently he that cannot
render a particular and [[good]] account of his being amongst them, is to
be judged conscious of an unlawfull, and tumultuous designe. it may be
lawfull for a thousand [[men]], to joyn in a petition to be delivered to a
judge, or magistrate; yet if a thousand [[men]] come to [[present]] it, it is
a tumultuous assembly; because there needs but one or two for that
purpose. but in such cases as these, it is not a set number that makes
the assembly unlawfull, but such a number, as the [[present]] officers are
not able to suppresse, and bring to [[justice]].

when an unusuall number of [[men]], assemble against a [[man]] whom they accuse;
the assembly is an unlawfull tumult; because they may deliver their
accusation to the magistrate by a few, or by one [[man]]. such was the case
of st. paul at ephesus; where demetrius, and a [[great]] number of other
men, brought two of pauls companions before the magistrate, saying with
one voyce, "great is diana of the ephesians;" which was their way of
demanding [[justice]] against them for teaching the [[people]] such doctrine,
as was against their [[religion]], and [[trade]]. the [[occasion]] here, considering
the lawes of that [[people]], was just; yet was their assembly judged
unlawfull, and the magistrate reprehended them for it, in these
words,(acts 19. 40) "if demetrius and the other work-men can accuse any
man, of any thing, there be pleas, and deputies, let them accuse one
another. and if you have any other thing to demand, your case may
be judged in an assembly lawfully called. for we are in danger to be
accused for this dayes sedition, because, there is no cause by which any
man can render any [[reason]] of this concourse of [[people]]." where he calleth
an assembly, whereof [[men]] can give no just account, a sedition, and such
as they could not [[answer]] for. and this is all i shall say concerning
systemes, and assemblyes of [[people]], which may be compared (as i said,)
to the similar parts of mans [[man]] [[body]]; such as be lawfull, to the muscles;
such as are unlawfull, to wens, biles, and apostemes, engendred by the
unnaturall conflux of evill humours [[humour]].



chapter xxiii. of the publique ministers of soveraign power


in the [[last]] [[chapter]] i have spoken of the similar parts of a
common-wealth; in this i shall speak of the parts organicall, which are
publique ministers.




publique minister who

a publique minister, is he, that by the soveraign, (whether a monarch,
or an assembly,) is employed in any affaires, with [[authority]] to
represent in that employment, the [[person]] of the common-wealth. and
whereas every [[man]], or assembly that hath soveraignty, representeth
two persons [[person]], or (as the more [[common]] phrase is) has two capacities, one
naturall, and another politique, (as a monarch, hath the [[person]] not
onely of the common-wealth, but also of a [[man]]; and a soveraign assembly
hath the [[person]] not onely of the common-wealth, but also of the
assembly); they that be servants to them in their naturall capacity,
are not publique ministers; but those onely that serve them in the
administration of the publique businesse. and therefore neither ushers,
nor sergeants, nor other officers that waite on the assembly, for
no other [[purpose]], but for the commodity of the [[men]] assembled, in an
aristocracy, or [[democracy]]; nor stewards, chamberlains, cofferers, or any
other officers of the houshold of a monarch, are publique ministers in a
monarchy.




ministers for the generall administration

of publique ministers, some have charge committed to them of a general
administration, either of the whole dominion, or of a part thereof.
of the whole, as to a protector, or regent, may bee committed by
the predecessor of an infant [[king]], during his minority, the whole
administration of his kingdome. in which case, every [[subject]] is so far
obliged to [[obedience]], as the ordinances he shall make, and the commands
he shall give be in the kings [[king]] name, and not inconsistent with his
soveraigne [[power]]. of a part, or province; as when either a monarch, or
a soveraign assembly, shall give the generall charge thereof to a
governour, lieutenant, praefect, or vice-roy: and in this case also,
every one of that province, is obliged to all he shall doe in the name
of the soveraign, and that not incompatible with the soveraigns [[right]].
for such protectors, vice-roys, and governours, have no other [[right]], but
what depends on the soveraigns will; and no commission that can be given
them, can be interpreted for a declaration of the will to transferre the
soveraignty, without expresse and perspicuous words to that [[purpose]]. and
this [[kind]] of publique ministers resembleth the nerves, and tendons that
move the severall limbs of a [[body]] naturall.




for speciall administration, as for oeconomy

others have speciall administration; that is to say, charges of some
speciall businesse, either at [[home]], or abroad: as at [[home]], first, for
the oeconomy of a common-wealth, they that have [[authority]] concerning the
treasure, as tributes, impositions, rents, fines, or whatsoever publique
revenue, to collect, receive, issue, or take the accounts thereof,
are publique ministers: ministers, because they serve the person
representative, and can doe nothing against his command, nor without his
authority: publique, because they serve him in his politicall capacity.

secondly, they that have [[authority]] concerning the militia; to have the
custody of armes, forts, ports; to levy, [[pay]], or conduct souldiers; or
to provide for any necessary thing for the use of [[war]], either by [[land]] or
sea, are publique ministers. but a souldier without command, though he
fight for the common-wealth, does not therefore represent the [[person]] of
it; because there is none to represent it to. for every one that hath
command, represents it to them only whom he commandeth.




for instruction of the people

they also that have [[authority]] to [[teach]], or to enable others to teach
the [[people]] their [[duty]] to the soveraign [[power]], and instruct them in the
knowledge of what is just, and [[unjust]], thereby to render them more apt
to [[live]] in godlinesse, and in [[peace]] among themselves, and resist the
publique [[enemy]], are publique ministers: ministers, in that they doe it
not by their own [[authority]], but by anothers; and publique, because they
doe it (or should doe it) by no [[authority]], but that of the soveraign.
the monarch, or the soveraign assembly only hath immediate authority
from [[god]], to [[teach]] and instruct the [[people]]; and no [[man]] but the
soveraign, receiveth his [[power]] dei gratia simply; that is to say, from
the favour of none but [[god]]: all other, receive theirs from the favour
and providence of [[god]], and their soveraigns; as in a [[monarchy]] dei gratia
& regis; or dei providentia & voluntate regis.




for judicature

they also to whom jurisdiction is given, are publique ministers. for in
their seats of [[justice]] they represent the [[person]] of the soveraign; and
their sentence, is his sentence; for (as hath been before declared) all
judicature is essentially annexed to the soveraignty; and therefore all
other judges [[judge]] are but ministers of him, or them that have the soveraign
power. and as controversies are of two sorts, namely of [[fact]], and of
law; so are judgements, some of [[fact]], some of [[law]]: and consequently in
the same controversie, there may be two judges [[judge]], one of [[fact]], another of
law.

and in both these controversies, there may arise a controversie between
the party judged, and the [[judge]]; which because they be both subjects [[subject]] to
the soveraign, ought in equity to be judged by [[men]] agreed on by consent
of both; for no [[man]] can be [[judge]] in his own cause. but the soveraign
is already agreed on for [[judge]] by them both, and is therefore either to
heare the cause, and determine it himself, or appoint for [[judge]] such as
they shall both agree on. and this agreement is then understood to be
made between them divers wayes; as first, if the defendant be allowed
to except against such of his judges [[judge]], whose interest maketh him suspect
them, (for as to the complaynant he hath already chosen his own [[judge]],)
those which he excepteth not against, are judges [[judge]] he himself agrees on.
secondly, if he appeale to any other [[judge]], he can appeale no further;
for his appeale is his [[choice]]. thirdly, if he appeale to the soveraign
himself, and he by himself, or by delegates which the parties shall
agree on, give sentence; that sentence is finall: for the defendant is
judged by his own judges [[judge]], that is to say, by himself.

these properties [[property]] of just and rationall judicature considered, i cannot
forbeare to observe the excellent [[constitution]] of the courts of [[justice]],
established both for [[common]], and also for publique pleas in [[england]]. by
common pleas, i meane those, where both the complaynant and defendant
are subjects [[subject]]: and by publique, (which are also called pleas of the
crown) those, where the complaynant is the soveraign. for whereas there
were two orders of [[men]], whereof one was lords [[lord]], the other commons [[common]]; the
lords had this priviledge, to have for judges [[judge]] in all capitall crimes,
none but lords [[lord]]; and of them, as many as would be [[present]]; which being
ever acknowledged as a priviledge of favour, their judges [[judge]] were none but
such as they had themselves [[desired]]. and in all controversies, every
subject (as also in civill controversies the lords) had for judges [[judge]], men
of the [[country]] where the matter in controversie lay; against which he
might make his exceptions, till at [[last]] twelve [[men]] without exception
being agreed on, they were judged by those twelve. so that having
his own judges [[judge]], there could be nothing alledged by the party, why the
sentence should not be finall, these publique persons [[person]], with authority
from the soveraign [[power]], either to instruct, or [[judge]] the [[people]],
are such members of the common-wealth, as may fitly be compared to the
organs of voice in a [[body]] naturall.




for execution

publique ministers are also all those, that have [[authority]] from the
soveraign, to procure the execution of judgements given; to publish the
soveraigns commands; to suppresse tumults; to apprehend, and imprison
malefactors; and other acts tending to the conservation of the
peace. for every act they doe by such [[authority]], is the act of the
common-wealth; and their service, answerable to that of the hands, in a
bodie naturall.

publique ministers abroad, are those that represent the [[person]] of their
own soveraign, to forraign states. such are ambassadors, messengers,
agents, and heralds, sent by publique authoritie, and on publique
businesse.

but such as are sent by authoritie only of some private partie of a
troubled [[state]], though they be received, are neither publique, nor
private ministers of the common-wealth; because none of their actions
have the common-wealth for author. likewise, an ambassador sent from a
prince, to congratulate, condole, or to assist at a solemnity, though
authority be publique; yet because the businesse is private, and
belonging to him in his naturall capacity; is a private [[person]]. also if
a [[man]] be sent into another [[country]], secretly to explore their counsels,
and [[strength]]; though both the [[authority]], and the businesse be publique;
yet because there is none to take notice of any [[person]] in him, but
his own; he is but a private minister; but yet a minister of the
common-wealth; and may be compared to an eye in the [[body]] naturall. and
those that are appointed to receive the petitions or other informations
of the [[people]], and are as it were the publique eare, are publique
ministers, and represent their soveraign in that office.




counsellers without other employment then to advise are not publique
ministers

neither a counsellor, nor a councell of [[state]], if we consider it with
no [[authority]] of judicature or command, but only of giving [[advice]] to
the soveraign when it is required, or of offering it when it is not
required, is a publique [[person]]. for the [[advice]] is addressed to the
soveraign only, whose [[person]] cannot in his own presence, be represented
to him, by another. but a [[body]] of counsellors, are never without some
other [[authority]], either of judicature, or of immediate administration:
as in a [[monarchy]], they represent the monarch, in delivering his commands
to the publique ministers: in a [[democracy]], the councell, or senate
propounds the result of their deliberations to the [[people]], as a
councell; but when they appoint judges [[judge]], or heare causes, or give
audience to ambassadors, it is in the quality of a minister of the
people: and in an [[aristocracy]] the councell of [[state]] is the soveraign
assembly it [[self]]; and gives counsell to none but themselves.



chapter xxiv. of the nutrition, and procreation of a common-wealth



the nourishment of a common-wealth consisteth in the commodities

of sea and land

the nutrition of a common-wealth consisteth, in the plenty, and
distribution of materials conducing to [[life]]: in concoction, or
preparation; and (when concocted) in the conveyance of it, by convenient
conduits, to the publique use.

as for the plenty of matter, it is a thing limited by [[nature]], to those
commodities, which from (the two breasts of our [[common]] mother) [[land]],
and sea, [[god]] usually either freely giveth, or for [[labour]] selleth to
man-kind.

for the matter of this nutriment, consisting in animals, vegetals, and
minerals, [[god]] hath freely layd them before us, in or neer to the face of
the [[earth]]; so as there needeth no more but the [[labour]], and industry
of receiving them. insomuch as plenty dependeth (next to gods favour)
meerly on the [[labour]] and industry of [[men]].

this matter, commonly called commodities, is partly native, and partly
forraign: native, that which is to be had within the territory of
the common-wealth; forraign, that which is imported from without. and
because there is no territory under the dominion of one common-wealth,
(except it be of very vast extent,) that produceth all things needfull
for the maintenance, and motion of the whole [[body]]; and few that produce
not something more than necessary; the superfluous commodities to be had
within, become no more superfluous, but supply these wants at [[home]], by
importation of that which may be had abroad, either by exchange, or
by just warre, or by [[labour]]: for a mans [[man]] [[labour]] also, is a commodity
exchangeable for benefit, as well as any other thing: and there have
been common-wealths that having no more territory, than hath served
them for habitation, have neverthelesse, not onely maintained, but also
encreased their [[power]], partly by the [[labour]] of trading from one place to
another, and partly by selling the manifactures, whereof the materials
were brought in from other places.




and the [[right]] of distribution of them

the distribution of the materials of this nourishment, is the
constitution of mine, and thine, and his, that is to say, in one word
propriety; and belongeth in all kinds [[kind]] of common-wealth to the soveraign
power. for where there is no common-wealth, there is, (as hath been
already shewn) a perpetuall warre of every [[man]] against his neighbour;
and therefore every thing is his that getteth it, and keepeth it by
force; which is neither propriety nor [[community]]; but uncertainty. which
is so evident, that even cicero, (a passionate defender of [[liberty]],) in
a publique pleading, attributeth all propriety to the [[law]] civil, "let
the civill [[law]]," saith he, "be once abandoned, or but negligently
guarded, (not to say [[oppressed]],) and there is nothing, that any [[man]] can
be sure to receive from his ancestor, or leave to his [[children]]." and
again; "take away the civill [[law]], and no [[man]] knows [[know]] what is his own, and
what another mans [[man]]." seeing therefore the introduction of propriety is
an effect of common-wealth; which can do nothing but by the [[person]] that
represents it, it is the act onely of the soveraign; and consisteth in
the lawes, which none can make that have not the soveraign [[power]]. and
this they well knew of old, who called that nomos, (that is to say,
distribution,) which we call [[law]]; and defined [[justice]], by distributing
to every [[man]] his own.




all private estates of [[land]] proceed originally from the arbitrary
distribution of the soveraign

in this distribution, the first [[law]], is for division of the [[land]] it
selfe: wherein the soveraign assigneth to every [[man]] a portion, according
as he, and not according as any [[subject]], or any number of them, shall
judge agreeable to equity, and the [[common]] [[good]]. the [[children]] of [[israel]],
were a common-wealth in the wildernesse; but wanted the commodities
of the [[earth]], till they were masters of the [[land]] of promise; which
afterward was divided amongst them, not by their own discretion, but
by the discretion of eleazar the [[priest]], and joshua their generall: who
when there were twelve tribes, making them thirteen by subdivision of
the tribe of joseph; made neverthelesse but twelve portions of the [[land]];
and ordained for the tribe of levi no [[land]]; but assigned them the tenth
part of the whole fruits; which division was therefore arbitrary. and
though a [[people]] comming into possession of a [[land]] by warre, do not
alwaies exterminate the antient inhabitants, (as did the jewes,) but
leave to many, or most, or all of them their estates; yet it is manifest
they hold them afterwards, as of the victors distribution; as the people
of [[england]] held all theirs of william the conquerour.




propriety of a [[subject]] excludes not the dominion of the soveraign, but
onely of another subject

from whence we may collect, that the propriety which a [[subject]] hath in
his lands [[land]], consisteth in a [[right]] to exclude all other subjects [[subject]] from the
use of them; and not to exclude their soveraign, be it an assembly, or
a monarch. for seeing the soveraign, that is to say, the common-wealth
(whose [[person]] he representeth,) is understood to do nothing but in order
to the [[common]] [[peace]] and security, this distribution of lands [[land]], is to be
understood as done in order to the same: and consequently, whatsoever
distribution he shall make in prejudice thereof, is contrary to the
will of every [[subject]], that committed his [[peace]], and safety to his
discretion, and [[conscience]]; and therefore by the will of every one of
them, is to be reputed voyd. it is true, that a soveraign monarch, or
the greater part of a soveraign assembly, may ordain the doing of many
things in pursuit of their [[passions]], contrary to their own consciences,
which is a breach of trust, and of the [[law]] of [[nature]]; but this is not
enough to authorise any [[subject]], either to make warre upon, or so much
as to accuse of [[injustice]], or any way to speak evill of their soveraign;
because they have authorised all his actions, and in bestowing the
soveraign [[power]], made them their own. but in what cases the commands
of soveraigns are contrary to equity, and the [[law]] of [[nature]], is to be
considered hereafter in another place.




the publique is not to be dieted

in the distribution of [[land]], the common-wealth it selfe, may be
conceived to have a portion, and possesse, and improve the same by
their representative; and that such portion may be made sufficient, to
susteine the whole expence to the [[common]] [[peace]], and defence necessarily
required: which were very true, if there could be any representative
conceived [[free]] from humane [[passions]], and infirmities. but the nature
of [[men]] being as it is, the setting forth of publique [[land]], or of any
certaine [[revenue]] for the common-wealth, is in vaine; and tendeth to the
dissolution of [[government]], and to the condition of meere [[nature]], and
war, assoon as ever the soveraign [[power]] falleth into the hands of a
monarch, or of an assembly, that are either too negligent of mony, or
too hazardous in engaging the publique stock, into a long, or costly
war. common-wealths can endure no diet: for seeing their expence is
not limited by their own appetite, but by externall accidents, and the
appetites of their neighbours, the publique riches [[rich]] cannot be limited by
other limits, than those which the emergent occasions [[occasion]] shall require. and
whereas in [[england]], there were by the conquerour, divers lands
reserved to his own use, (besides forrests, and chases, either for his
recreation, or for preservation of woods,) and divers services reserved
on the [[land]] he gave his subjects [[subject]]; yet it seems they were not reserved
for his maintenance in his publique, but in his naturall capacity: for
he, and his successors did for all that, lay arbitrary taxes on all
subjects [[land]], when they judged it necessary. or if those publique
lands, and services, were ordained as a sufficient maintenance of the
common-wealth, it was contrary to the scope of the institution; being
(as it appeared by those ensuing taxes) insufficient, and (as it
appeares by the late [[revenue]] of the crown) [[subject]] to alienation,
and diminution. it is therefore in vaine, to assign a portion to the
common-wealth; which may sell, or give it away; and does sell, and give
it away when tis done by their representative.




the places and matter of traffique depend, as their distribution, on
the soveraign

as the distribution of lands [[land]] at [[home]]; so also to assigne in what places,
and for what commodities, the [[subject]] shall traffique abroad, belongeth
to the soveraign. for if it did belong to private persons [[person]] to use their
own discretion therein, some of them would bee drawn for gaine, both
to furnish the [[enemy]] with means to hurt the common-wealth, and hurt it
themselves, by importing such things, as pleasing mens [[men]] appetites, be
neverthelesse noxious, or at least unprofitable to them. and therefore
it belongeth to the common-wealth, (that is, to the soveraign only,)
to approve, or disapprove both of the places, and matter of forraign
traffique.




the laws [[law]] of transferring [[property]] belong also to the soveraign

further, seeing it is not enough to the sustentation of a common-wealth,
that every [[man]] have a propriety in a portion of [[land]], or in some few
commodities, or a naturall [[property]] in some usefull art [[arts]], and there is no
art in the [[world]], but is necessary either for the being, or well being
almost of every particular [[man]]; it is necessary, that [[men]] distribute
that which they can spare, and transferre their propriety therein,
mutually one to another, by exchange, and mutuall contract. and
therefore it belongeth to the common-wealth, (that is to say, to the
soveraign,) to appoint in what manner, all kinds [[kind]] of contract between
subjects, (as buying, selling, exchanging, borrowing, lending, letting,
and taking to hire,) are to bee made; and by what words, and signes they
shall be understood for valid. and for the matter, and distribution of
the nourishment, to the severall members of the common-wealth, thus much
(considering the modell of the whole worke) is sufficient.




mony the bloud of a common-wealth

by concoction, i [[understand]] the reducing of all commodities, which are
not presently consumed, but reserved for nourishment in [[time]] to come, to
some thing of [[equal]] value, and withall so portably, as not to hinder
the motion of [[men]] from place to place; to the end a [[man]] may have in
what place soever, such nourishment as the place affordeth. and this is
nothing else but gold, and silver, and mony. for gold and silver, being
(as it happens) almost in all countries [[country]] of the [[world]] highly valued, is a
commodious measure for the value of all things else between nations; and
mony (of what matter soever coyned by the soveraign of a common-wealth,)
is a sufficient measure of the value of all things else, between the
subjects of that common-wealth. by the means of which measures, all
commodities, moveable, and immoveable, are made to accompany a [[man]], to
all places of his resort, within and without the place of his
ordinary residence; and the same passeth from [[man]] to [[man]], within the
common-wealth; and goes round about, nourishing (as it passeth)
every part thereof; in so much as this concoction, is as it were the
sanguification of the common-wealth: for naturall bloud is in like
manner made of the fruits of the [[earth]]; and circulating, nourisheth by
the way, every member of the [[body]] of [[man]].

and because silver and gold, have their value from the matter it [[self]];
they have first this priviledge, that the value of them cannot be
altered by the [[power]] of one, nor of a few common-wealths; as being a
common measure of the commodities of all places. but base mony, may
easily be enhanced, or abased. secondly, they have the priviledge to
make common-wealths, move, and stretch out their armes, when need is,
into forraign countries [[country]]; and supply, not only private subjects [[subject]] that
travell, but also whole armies [[army]] with provision. but that coyne, which is
not considerable for the matter, but for the stamp of the place, being
unable to endure [[change]] of ayr, hath its effect at [[home]] only; where
also it is [[subject]] to the [[change]] of laws [[law]], and thereby to have the value
diminished, to the prejudice many times [[time]] of those that have it.




the conduits and way of mony to the publique use

the conduits, and wayes by which it is conveyed to the publique use, are
of two sorts; one, that conveyeth it to the publique coffers; the other,
that issueth the same out againe for publique payments. of the first
sort, are collectors, receivers, and treasurers; of the second are the
treasurers againe, and the officers appointed for payment of severall
publique or private ministers. and in this also, the artificiall man
maintains his resemblance with the naturall; whose veins receiving the
bloud from the severall parts of the [[body]], carry it to the [[heart]]; where
being made vitall, the [[heart]] by the arteries sends it out again, to
enliven, and enable for motion all the members of the same.




the [[children]] of a common-wealth colonies

the procreation, or [[children]] of a common-wealth, are those we call
plantations, or colonies; which are numbers of [[men]] sent out from the
common-wealth, under a conductor, or governour, to inhabit a forraign
country, either formerly voyd of inhabitants, or made voyd then, by
warre. and when a colony is setled, they are either a common-wealth of
themselves, discharged of their subjection to their soveraign that sent
them, (as hath been done by many common-wealths of antient [[time]],) in
which case the common-wealth from which they went was called their
metropolis, or [[mother]], and requires no more of them, then fathers
require of the [[children]], whom they emancipate, and make [[free]] from their
domestique [[government]], which is [[honour]], and [[friendship]]; or else they
remain [[united]] to their metropolis, as were the colonies of the [[people]] of
rome; and then they are no common-wealths themselves, but provinces, and
parts of the common-wealth that sent them. so that the [[right]] of colonies
(saving [[honour]], and league with their metropolis,) dependeth wholly on
their licence, or letters, by which their soveraign authorised them to
plant.



chapter xxv. of counsell




counsell what

how fallacious it is to [[judge]] of the [[nature]] of things, by the ordinary
and inconstant use of words, appeareth in nothing more, than in the
confusion of counsels, and commands, arising from the imperative manner
of speaking in them both, and in many other occasions [[occasion]] besides. for the
words "doe this," are the words not onely of him that commandeth; but
also of him that giveth counsell; and of him that exhorteth; and yet
there are but few, that see not, that these are very different things;
or that cannot distinguish between them, when they perceive who it
is that speaketh, and to whom the [[speech]] is directed, and upon what
occasion. but finding those phrases in mens [[men]] writings, and being not
able, or not willing to enter into a consideration of the circumstances,
they mistake sometimes the precepts of counsellours, for the precepts
of them that command; and sometimes the contrary; according as it best
agreeth with the conclusions they would inferre, or the actions
they approve. to avoyd which mistakes, and render to those termes
of commanding, counselling, and exhorting, their proper and distinct
significations, i define them thus.




differences between command and counsell

command is, where a [[man]] saith, "doe this," or "doe this not," without
expecting other [[reason]] than the will of him that sayes it. from this it
followeth manifestly, that he that commandeth, pretendeth thereby his
own benefit: for the [[reason]] of his command is his own will onely, and
the proper object of every mans [[man]] will, is some [[good]] to himselfe.

counsell, is where a [[man]] saith, "doe" or "doe not this," and deduceth
his own reasons [[reason]] from the benefit that arriveth by it to him to whom he
saith it. and from this it is evident, that he that giveth counsell,
pretendeth onely (whatsoever he intendeth) the [[good]] of him, to whom he
giveth it.

therefore between counsell and command, one [[great]] difference is, that
command is directed to a mans [[man]] own benefit; and counsell to the benefit
of another [[man]]. and from this ariseth another difference, that a man
may be obliged to do what he is commanded; as when he hath covenanted
to obey: but he cannot be obliged to do as he is counselled, because the
hurt of not following it, is his own; or if he should covenant to follow
it, then is the counsell turned into the [[nature]] of a command. a third
difference between them is, that no [[man]] can pretend a [[right]] to be of
another mans [[man]] counsell; because he is not to pretend benefit by it to
himselfe; but to demand [[right]] to counsell another, argues a will to know
his designes, or to gain some other [[good]] to himselfe; which (as i said
before) is of every mans [[man]] will the proper object.

this also is incident to the [[nature]] of counsell; that whatsoever it be,
he that asketh it, cannot in equity accuse, or punish it: for to ask
counsell of another, is to permit him to give such counsell as he shall
think [[best]]; and consequently, he that giveth counsell to his soveraign,
(whether a monarch, or an assembly) when he asketh it, cannot in equity
be punished for it, whether the same be conformable to the [[opinion]] of
the most, or not, so it be to the proposition in debate. for if the
sense of the assembly can be taken notice of, before the debate be
ended, they should neither ask, nor take any further counsell; for the
sense of the assembly, is the resolution of the debate, and end of all
deliberation. and generally he that demandeth counsell, is author of it;
and therefore cannot punish it; and what the soveraign cannot, no man
else can. but if one [[subject]] giveth counsell to another, to do any
thing contrary to the lawes, whether that counsell proceed from
evill intention, or from ignorance onely, it is punishable by the
common-wealth; because ignorance of the [[law]], is no [[good]] excuse, where
every [[man]] is bound to take notice of the lawes to which he is [[subject]].




exhortation and dehortation what

exhortation, and dehortation, is counsell, accompanied with signes in
him that giveth it, of vehement [[desire]] to have it followed; or to say it
more briefly, counsell vehemently pressed. for he that exhorteth, doth
not deduce the consequences of what he adviseth to be done, and tye
himselfe therein to the rigour of true reasoning; but encourages him he
counselleth, to action: as he that dehorteth, deterreth him from it. and
therefore they have in their speeches [[speech]], a regard to the [[common]] [[passions]],
and opinions [[opinion]] of [[men]], in deducing their reasons [[reason]]; and make use of
similitudes, metaphors, examples [[example]], and other tooles of oratory, to
perswade their hearers of the utility, [[honour]], or [[justice]] of following
their advise.

from whence may be inferred, first, that exhortation and dehortation,
is directed to the [[good]] of him that giveth the counsell, not of him that
asketh it, which is contrary to the [[duty]] of a counsellour; who (by the
definition of counsell) ought to regard, not his own benefits, but his
whom he adviseth. and that he directeth his counsell to his own
benefit, is manifest enough, by the long and vehement urging, or by
the artificial giving thereof; which being not required of him, and
consequently proceeding from his own occasions [[occasion]], is directed principally
to his own benefit, and but accidentarily to the [[good]] of him that is
counselled, or not at all.

secondly, that the use of exhortation and dehortation lyeth onely, where
a [[man]] is to speak to a multitude; because when the [[speech]] is addressed
to one, he may interrupt him, and examine his reasons [[reason]] more rigorously,
than can be done in a multitude; which are too many to enter into
dispute, and dialogue with him that speaketh indifferently to them
all at once. thirdly, that they that exhort and dehort, where they are
required to give counsell, are [[corrupt]] counsellours, and as it were
bribed by their own interest. for though the counsell they give be never
so [[good]]; yet he that gives it, is no more a [[good]] counsellour, than he
that giveth a just sentence for a [[reward]], is a just [[judge]]. but where a
man may lawfully command, as a [[father]] in his [[family]], or a leader in an
army, his exhortations and dehortations, are not onely lawfull, but
also necessary, and laudable: but then they are no more counsells, but
commands; which when they are for execution of soure [[labour]]; sometimes
necessity, and alwayes [[humanity]] requireth to be sweetned in the
delivery, by encouragement, and in the tune and phrase of counsell,
rather then in harsher [[language]] of command.

examples of the difference between command and counsell, we may take
from the formes of [[speech]] that expresse them in holy [[scripture]]. "have no
other gods but me; make to thy selfe no graven image; take not gods name
in [[vain]]; sanctifie the [[sabbath]]; [[honour]] thy parents; kill not; steale
not," &c. are commands; because the [[reason]] for which we are to obey
them, is drawn from the will of [[god]] our [[king]], whom we are obliged to
obey. but these words, "sell all thou hast; give it to the poore; and
follow me," are counsell; because the [[reason]] for which we are to do
so, is drawn from our own benefit; which is this, that we shall have
"treasure in [[heaven]]." these words, "go into the village over against
you, and you shall find an asse tyed, and her colt; loose her, and bring
her to me," are a command: for the [[reason]] of their [[fact]] is drawn from
the will of their master: but these words, "repent, and be baptized in
the name of [[jesus]]," are counsell; because the [[reason]] why we should so
do, tendeth not to any benefit of [[god]] almighty, who shall still be king
in what manner soever we rebell; but of our selves, who have no other
means of avoyding the [[punishment]] hanging over us for our sins [[sin]].




differences of fit and unfit counsellours

as the difference of counsell from command, hath been now deduced from
the [[nature]] of counsell, consisting in a deducing of the benefit, or
hurt that may arise to him that is to be counselled, by the necessary
or probable consequences of the action he propoundeth; so may also the
differences between apt, and inept counsellours be derived from the
same. for [[experience]], being but memory of the consequences of like
actions formerly observed, and counsell but the [[speech]] whereby that
experience is made known to another; the vertues, and defects of
counsell, are the same with the vertues, and defects intellectuall:
and to the [[person]] of a common-wealth, his counsellours serve him in the
place of memory, and mentall discourse. but with this resemblance of the
common-wealth, to a naturall [[man]], there is one dissimilitude joyned,
of [[great]] importance; which is, that a naturall [[man]] receiveth his
experience, from the naturall objects of sense, which [[work]] upon him
without passion, or interest of their own; whereas they that give
counsell to the representative [[person]] of a common-wealth, may have,
and have often their particular ends, and [[passions]], that render their
counsells alwayes suspected, and many times [[time]] unfaithfull. and therefore
we may set down for the first condition of a [[good]] counsellour, that his
ends, and interest, be not inconsistent with the ends and interest of
him he counselleth.

secondly, because the office of a counsellour, when an action comes
into deliberation, is to make manifest the consequences of it, in such
manner, as he that is counselled may be truly and evidently informed; he
ought to propound his advise, in such forme of [[speech]], as may make
the [[truth]] most evidently appear; that is to say, with as firme
ratiocination, as significant and proper [[language]], and as briefly, as
the evidence will permit. and therefore rash, and unevident inferences;
(such as are fetched onely from examples [[example]], or [[authority]] of books [[book]], and are
not arguments of what is [[good]], or evill, but witnesses of [[fact]], or
of [[opinion]],) obscure, confused, and ambiguous expressions, also all
metaphoricall speeches [[speech]], tending to the stirring up of passion, (because
such reasoning, and such expressions, are usefull onely to [[deceive]], or
to lead him we counsell towards other ends than his own) are repugnant
to the office of a counsellour.

thirdly, because the ability of counselling proceedeth from [[experience]],
and long study; and no [[man]] is presumed to have [[experience]] in all those
things that to the administration of a [[great]] common-wealth are necessary
to be known, no [[man]] is presumed to be a [[good]] counsellour, but in such
businesse, as he hath not onely been much versed in, but hath also
much meditated on, and considered. for seeing the businesse of a
common-wealth is this, to preserve the [[people]] at [[home]], and defend them
against forraign [[invasion]], we shall find, it requires [[great]] knowledge
of the disposition of man-kind, of the rights [[right]] of [[government]], and of the
nature of equity, [[law]], [[justice]], and [[honour]], not to be attained without
study; and of the [[strength]], commodities, places, both of their own
country, and their neighbours; as also of the inclinations, and designes
of all nations that may any way annoy them. and this is not attained to,
without much [[experience]]. of which things, not onely the whole summe, but
every one of the particulars requires the [[age]], and observation of a man
in years, and of more than ordinary study. the wit required for counsel,
as i have said before is judgement. and the differences of [[men]] in that
point come from different [[education]], of some to one [[kind]] of study, or
businesse, and of others to another. when for the doing of any thing,
there be infallible rules [[rule]], (as in engines, and edifices, the rules [[rule]] of
geometry,) all the [[experience]] of the [[world]] cannot equall his counsell,
that has learnt, or found out the [[rule]]. and when there is no such [[rule]],
he that hath most [[experience]] in that particular [[kind]] of businesse, has
therein the [[best]] judgement, and is the [[best]] counsellour.

fourthly, to be able to give counsell to a common-wealth, in a businesse
that hath reference to another common-wealth, it is necessary to be
acquainted with the intelligences, and letters that come from thence,
and with all the records of treaties, and other transactions of state
between them; which none can doe, but such as the representative
shall [[think]] fit. by which we may see, that they who are not called to
counsell, can have no [[good]] counsell in such cases to obtrude.

fifthly, supposing the number of counsellors equall, a [[man]] is better
counselled by hearing them apart, then in an assembly; and that for many
causes. first, in hearing them apart, you have the [[advice]] of every [[man]];
but in an assembly may of them deliver their advise with i, or no, or
with their hands, or feet, not moved by their own sense, but by the
eloquence of another, or for feare of displeasing some that have spoken,
or the whole assembly, by contradiction; or for feare of appearing
duller in apprehension, than those that have applauded the contrary
opinion. secondly, in an assembly of many, there cannot choose but be
some whose interests are contrary to that of the publique; and these
their interests make passionate, and passion eloquent, and eloquence
drawes others into the same [[advice]]. for the [[passions]] of [[men]], which
asunder are moderate, as the heat of one brand; in assembly are like
many brands, that enflame one another, (especially when they blow one
another with orations) to the setting of the common-wealth on [[fire]],
under pretence of counselling it. thirdly, in hearing every [[man]] apart,
one may examine (when there is need) the [[truth]], or probability of
his reasons [[reason]], and of the grounds of the advise he gives, by frequent
interruptions, and objections; which cannot be done in an assembly,
where (in every difficult question) a [[man]] is rather astonied, and dazled
with the variety of discourse upon it, than informed of the course he
ought to take. besides, there cannot be an assembly of many, called
together for [[advice]], wherein there be not some, that have the ambition
to be [[thought]] eloquent, and also learned in the politiques; and give not
their [[advice]] with [[care]] of the businesse propounded, but of the applause
of their motly orations, made of the divers colored threds, or shreds of
authors; which is an impertinence at least, that takes away the time
of serious consultation, and in the secret way of counselling apart, is
easily avoided. fourthly, in deliberations that ought to be kept secret,
(whereof there be many occasions [[occasion]] in publique businesse,) the counsells
of many, and especially in assemblies, are dangerous; and therefore
great assemblies are necessitated to commit such affaires to lesser
numbers, and of such persons [[person]] as are most versed, and in whose fidelity
they have most confidence.

to conclude, who is there that so far approves the taking of counsell
from a [[great]] assembly of counsellours, that wisheth for, or would accept
of their pains [[pain]], when there is a [[question]] of marrying his [[children]],
disposing of his lands [[land]], governing his household, or managing his
private estate, especially if there be amongst them such as [[wish]] not
his [[prosperity]]? a [[man]] that doth his businesse by the [[help]] of many and
prudent counsellours, with every one consulting apart in his proper
element, does it [[best]], as he that useth able seconds at tennis play,
placed in their proper stations. he does next [[best]], that useth his own
judgement only; as he that has no second at all. but he that is carried
up and down to his businesse in a framed counsell, which cannot move
but by the plurality of consenting opinions [[opinion]], the execution whereof is
commonly (out of envy, or interest) retarded by the part dissenting,
does it worst of all, and like one that is carried to the ball, though
by [[good]] players, yet in a wheele-barrough, or other frame, heavy of it
self, and retarded also by the inconcurrent judgements, and endeavours
of them that drive it; and so much the more, as they be more that set
their hands to it; and most of all, when there is one, or more amongst
them, that [[desire]] to have him lose. and though it be true, that many eys
see more then one; yet it is not to be understood of many counsellours;
but then only, when the finall resolution is in one [[man]]. otherwise,
because many [[eyes]] see the same thing in divers lines, and are apt to
look asquint towards their private benefit; they that [[desire]] not to
misse their marke, though they look about with two [[eyes]], yet they never
ayme but with one; and therefore no [[great]] popular common-wealth was
ever kept up; but either by a forraign [[enemy]] that [[united]] them; or by
the [[reputation]] of some one eminent [[man]] amongst them; or by the secret
counsell of a few; or by the mutuall feare of equall factions; and
not by the open consultations of the assembly. and as for very little
common-wealths, be they popular, or monarchicall, there is no humane
wisdome can uphold them, longer then the [[jealousy]] lasteth of their
potent neighbours.



chapter xxvi. of civill lawes




civill [[law]] what

by civill lawes, i [[understand]] the lawes, that [[men]] are therefore bound to
observe, because they are members, not of this, or that common-wealth
in particular, but of a common-wealth. for the [[knowledge]] of particular
lawes belongeth to them, that professe the study of the lawes of their
severall countries [[country]]; but the [[knowledge]] of civill [[law]] in generall, to any
man. the antient [[law]] of [[rome]] was called their civil [[law]], from the word
civitas, which signifies a common-wealth; and those countries [[country]], which
having been under the roman [[empire]], and governed by that [[law]], retaine
still such part thereof as they [[think]] fit, call that part the civill
law, to distinguish it from the rest of their own civill lawes. but that
is not it i intend to speak of here; my designe being not to shew what
is [[law]] here, and there; but what is [[law]]; as [[plato]], [[aristotle]], cicero,
and divers others have done, without taking upon them the profession of
the study of the [[law]].

and first it manifest, that [[law]] in generall, is not counsell, but
command; nor a command of any [[man]] to any [[man]]; but only of him, whose
command is addressed to one formerly obliged to obey him. and as for
civill [[law]], it addeth only the name of the [[person]] commanding, which is
persona civitatis, the [[person]] of the common-wealth.

which considered, i define civill [[law]] in this manner. "civill [[law]], is to
every [[subject]], those rules [[rule]], which the common-wealth hath commanded him,
by word, writing, or other sufficient sign of the will, to make use
of, for the distinction of [[right]], and [[wrong]]; that is to say, of what is
contrary, and what is not contrary to the [[rule]]."

in which definition, there is nothing that is not at first sight
evident. for every [[man]] seeth, that some lawes are addressed to all the
subjects in generall; some to particular provinces; some to particular
vocations; and some to particular [[men]]; and are therefore lawes, to every
of those to whom the command is directed; and to none else. as also,
that lawes are the rules [[rule]] of just, and [[unjust]]; nothing being reputed
unjust, that is not contrary to some [[law]]. likewise, that none can
make lawes but the common-wealth; because our subjection is to the
common-wealth only: and that commands, are to be signified by sufficient
signs; because a [[man]] knows [[know]] not otherwise how to obey them. and
therefore, whatsoever can from this definition by necessary consequence
be deduced, ought to be acknowledged for [[truth]]. now i deduce from it
this that followeth.




the soveraign is legislator

1. the legislator in all common-wealths, is only the soveraign, be he
one [[man]], as in a [[monarchy]], or one assembly of [[men]], as in a [[democracy]],
or [[aristocracy]]. for the legislator, is he that maketh the [[law]]. and the
common-wealth only, praescribes, and commandeth the observation of those
rules, which we call [[law]]: therefore the common-wealth is the legislator.
but the common-wealth is no [[person]], nor has capacity to doe any thing,
but by the representative, (that is, the soveraign;) and therefore the
soveraign is the sole legislator. for the same [[reason]], none can abrogate
a [[law]] made, but the soveraign; because a [[law]] is not abrogated, but by
another [[law]], that forbiddeth it to be put in execution.




and not [[subject]] to civill law

2. the soveraign of a common-wealth, be it an assembly, or one [[man]], is
not [[subject]] to the civill lawes. for having [[power]] to make, and repeale
lawes, he may when he pleaseth, [[free]] himselfe from that subjection,
by repealing those lawes that trouble him, and making of new; and
consequently he was [[free]] before. for he is [[free]], that can be [[free]] when
he will: nor is it possible for any [[person]] to be bound to himselfe;
because he that can bind, can release; and therefore he that is bound to
himselfe onely, is not bound.




use, a [[law]] not by vertue of [[time]], but of the soveraigns consent

3. when long use obtaineth the [[authority]] of a [[law]], it is not the
length of [[time]] that maketh the [[authority]], but the will of the soveraign
signified by his [[silence]], (for [[silence]] is sometimes an argument of
consent;) and it is no longer [[law]], then the soveraign shall be silent
therein. and therefore if the soveraign shall have a [[question]] of right
grounded, not upon his [[present]] will, but upon the lawes formerly
made; the length of [[time]] shal bring no prejudice to his [[right]]; but the
question shal be judged by equity. for many [[unjust]] actions, and unjust
sentences, go uncontrolled a longer [[time]], than any [[man]] can [[remember]].
and our lawyers account no customes [[law]], but such as are reasonable, and
that evill customes are to be abolished; but the judgement of what is
reasonable, and of what is to be abolished, belongeth to him that maketh
the [[law]], which is the soveraign assembly, or monarch.




the [[law]] of [[nature]], and the civill [[law]] contain each other

4. the [[law]] of [[nature]], and the civill [[law]], contain each other, and are
of equall extent. for the lawes of [[nature]], which consist in equity,
justice, gratitude, and other morall vertues on these depending, in the
condition of meer [[nature]] (as i have said before in the end of the 15th
chapter,) are not properly lawes, but qualities that dispose [[men]] to
peace, and to [[obedience]]. when a common-wealth is once settled, then are
they actually lawes, and not before; as being then the commands of the
common-wealth; and therefore also civill lawes: for it is the soveraign
power that obliges [[men]] to obey them. for in the differences of private
men, to declare, what is equity, what is [[justice]], and what is morall
vertue, and to make them binding, there is need of the ordinances of
soveraign [[power]], and punishments [[punishment]] to be ordained for such as shall break
them; which ordinances are therefore part of the civill [[law]]. the [[law]] of
nature therefore is a part of the civill [[law]] in all common-wealths of
the [[world]]. reciprocally also, the civill [[law]] is a part of the dictates
of [[nature]]. for [[justice]], that is to say, performance of covenant, and
giving to every [[man]] his own, is a dictate of the [[law]] of [[nature]]. but
every [[subject]] in a common-wealth, hath covenanted to obey the civill
law, (either one with another, as when they assemble to make a common
representative, or with the representative it selfe one by one, when
subdued by the [[sword]] they promise [[obedience]], that they may receive
life;) and therefore [[obedience]] to the civill [[law]] is part also of the
law of [[nature]]. civill, and naturall [[law]] are not different kinds [[kind]], but
different parts of [[law]]; whereof one part being written, is called
civill, the other unwritten, naturall. but the [[right]] of [[nature]], that
is, the naturall [[liberty]] of [[man]], may by the civill [[law]] be abridged,
and restrained: nay, the end of making lawes, is no other, but such
restraint; without the which there cannot possibly be any [[peace]]. and law
was brought into the [[world]] for nothing else, but to limit the naturall
liberty of particular [[men]], in such manner, as they might not hurt, but
assist one another, and joyn together against a [[common]] [[enemy]].




provinciall lawes are not made by custome, but by the soveraign power

5. if the soveraign of one common-wealth, subdue a [[people]] that have
lived under other written lawes, and afterwards govern them by the
same lawes, by which they were governed before; yet those lawes are the
civill lawes of the victor, and not of the vanquished common-wealth, for
the legislator is he, not by whose [[authority]] the lawes were first made,
but by whose [[authority]] they now continue to be lawes. and therefore
where there be divers provinces, within the dominion of a common-wealth,
and in those provinces [[diversity]] of lawes, which commonly are called the
customes of each severall province, we are not to [[understand]] that such
customes have their [[force]], onely from length of [[time]]; but that they were
antiently lawes written, or otherwise made known, for the constitutions [[constitution]],
and statutes of their soveraigns; and are now lawes, not by vertue of
the praescription of [[time]], but by the constitutions [[constitution]] of their present
soveraigns. but if an unwritten [[law]], in all the provinces of a dominion,
shall be generally observed, and no [[iniquity]] appear in the use thereof;
that [[law]] can be no other but a [[law]] of [[nature]], equally obliging all
man-kind.




some foolish opinions [[opinion]] of lawyers concerning the making of lawes

6. seeing then all lawes, written, and unwritten, have their [[authority]],
and [[force]], from the will of the common-wealth; that is to say, from the
will of the representative; which in a [[monarchy]] is the monarch, and
in other common-wealths the soveraign assembly; a [[man]] may wonder from
whence proceed such opinions [[opinion]], as are found in the books [[book]] of lawyers of
eminence in severall common-wealths, directly, or by consequence making
the legislative [[power]] depend on private [[men]], or subordinate judges [[judge]].
as for [[example]], "that the [[common]] [[law]], hath no controuler but the
parlament;" which is true onely where a parlament has the soveraign
power, and cannot be assembled, nor dissolved, but by their own
discretion. for if there be a [[right]] in any else to dissolve them, there
is a [[right]] also to controule them, and consequently to controule their
controulings. and if there be no such [[right]], then the controuler of
lawes is not parlamentum, but rex in parlamento. and where a parlament
is soveraign, if it should assemble never so many, or so [[wise]] [[men]], from
the countries [[country]] [[subject]] to them, for whatsoever cause; yet there is no man
will [[believe]], that such an assembly hath thereby acquired to themselves
a legislative [[power]]. item, that the two arms of a common-wealth,
are [[force]], and [[justice]]; the first whereof is in the [[king]]; the other
deposited in the hands of the parlament. as if a common-wealth could
consist, where the [[force]] were in any hand, which [[justice]] had not the
authority to command and govern.

7. that [[law]] can never be against [[reason]], our lawyers are agreed; and
that not the letter,(that is, every construction of it,) but that which
is according to the intention of the legislator, is the [[law]]. and it is
true: but the [[doubt]] is, of whose [[reason]] it is, that shall be received
for [[law]]. it is not meant of any private [[reason]]; for then there would be
as much contradiction in the lawes, as there is in the schooles; nor yet
(as sr. ed, coke makes it (sir edward coke, upon littleton lib.2. ch.6
fol 97.b),) an artificiall [[perfection]] of [[reason]], gotten by long study,
observation, and [[experience]], (as his was.) for it is possible long study
may encrease, and confirm erroneous sentences: and where [[men]] build on
false grounds, the more they build, the greater is the ruine; and of
those that study, and observe with equall [[time]], and diligence, the
reasons and resolutions are, and must remain discordant: and therefore
it is not that juris prudentia, or wisedome of subordinate judges [[judge]];
but the [[reason]] of this our artificiall [[man]] the common-wealth, and
his command, that maketh [[law]]: and the common-wealth being in
their representative but one [[person]], there cannot easily arise any
contradiction in the lawes; and when there doth, the same [[reason]] is
able, by interpretation, or alteration, to take it away. in all courts
of [[justice]], the soveraign (which is the [[person]] of the common-wealth,)
is he that judgeth: the subordinate [[judge]], ought to have regard to the
reason, which moved his soveraign to make such [[law]], that his sentence
may be according thereunto; which then is his soveraigns sentence;
otherwise it is his own, and an [[unjust]] one.




law made, if not also made known, is no law

8. from this, that the [[law]] is a command, and a command consisteth in
declaration, or manifestation of the will of him that commandeth, by
voyce, writing, or some other sufficient argument of the same, we may
understand, that the command of the common-wealth, is [[law]] onely to
those, that have means to take notice of it. over naturall fooles,
children, or mad-men there is no [[law]], no more than over brute beasts;
nor are they capable of the title of just, or [[unjust]]; because they had
never [[power]] to make any covenant, or to [[understand]] the consequences
thereof; and consequently never took upon them to authorise the
actions of any soveraign, as they must do that make to themselves a
common-wealth. and as those from whom [[nature]], or accident hath taken
away the notice of all lawes in generall; so also every [[man]], from whom
any accident, not proceeding from his own default, hath taken away the
means to take notice of any particular [[law]], is excused, if he observe it
not; and to speak properly, that [[law]] is no [[law]] to him. it is therefore
necessary, to consider in this place, what arguments, and signes be
sufficient for the [[knowledge]] of what is the [[law]]; that is to say, what is
the will of the soveraign, as well in monarchies [[monarchy]], as in other formes of
government.




unwritten lawes are all of them lawes of nature

and first, if it be a [[law]] that obliges all the subjects [[subject]] without
exception, and is not written, nor otherwise published in such places as
they may take notice thereof, it is a [[law]] of [[nature]]. for whatsoever men
are to take [[knowledge]] of for [[law]], not upon other mens [[men]] words, but every
one from his own [[reason]], must be such as is agreeable to the [[reason]] of
all [[men]]; which no [[law]] can be, but the [[law]] of [[nature]]. the lawes of nature
therefore need not any publishing, nor proclamation; as being contained
in this one sentence, approved by all the [[world]], "do not that to
another, which thou thinkest unreasonable to be done by another to thy
selfe."

secondly, if it be a [[law]] that obliges only some condition of [[men]], or one
particular [[man]] and be not written, nor published by word, then also it
is a [[law]] of [[nature]]; and known by the same arguments, and signs,
that distinguish those in such a condition, from other subjects [[subject]]. for
whatsoever [[law]] is not written, or some way published by him that makes
it [[law]], can be known no way, but by the [[reason]] of him that is to obey
it; and is therefore also a [[law]] not only civill, but naturall. for
example, if the soveraign employ a publique minister, without written
instructions what to doe; he is obliged to take for instructions the
dictates of [[reason]]; as if he make a [[judge]], the [[judge]] is to take notice,
that his sentence ought to be according to the [[reason]] of his soveraign,
which being alwaies understood to be equity, he is bound to it by the
law of [[nature]]: or if an ambassador, he is (in al things not conteined
in his written instructions) to take for instruction that which reason
dictates to be most conducing to his soveraigns interest; and so of
all other ministers of the soveraignty, publique and private. all which
instructions of naturall [[reason]] may be comprehended under one name of
fidelity; which is a branch of naturall [[justice]].

the [[law]] of [[nature]] excepted, it belongeth to the essence of all other
lawes, to be made known, to every [[man]] that shall be obliged to obey
them, either by word, or writing, or some other act, known to proceed
from the soveraign [[authority]]. for the will of another, cannot be
understood, but by his own word, or act, or by conjecture taken from his
scope and [[purpose]]; which in the [[person]] of the common-wealth, is to be
supposed alwaies consonant to equity and [[reason]]. and in antient [[time]],
before letters were in [[common]] use, the lawes were many times [[time]] put into
verse; that the rude [[people]] taking [[pleasure]] in singing, or reciting
them, might the more easily reteine them in memory. and for the same
reason solomon adviseth a [[man]], to bind the ten commandements (prov. 7.
3) upon his ten fingers. and for the [[law]] which [[moses]] gave to the people
of [[israel]] at the renewing of the covenant, (deut. 11. 19) he biddeth
them to [[teach]] it their [[children]], by discoursing of it both at [[home]], and
upon the way; at going to bed, and at rising from bed; and to write
it upon the posts, and dores of their houses; and (deut. 31. 12) to
assemble the [[people]], [[man]], woman, and child, to heare it [[read]].




nothing is [[law]] where the legislator cannot be known

nor is it enough the [[law]] be written, and published; but also that there
be manifest signs, that it proceedeth from the will of the soveraign.
for private [[men]], when they have, or [[think]] they have [[force]] enough to
secure their [[unjust]] designes, and convoy them safely to their ambitious
ends, may publish for lawes what they please, without, or against
the legislative [[authority]]. there is therefore requisite, not only a
declaration of the [[law]], but also sufficient signes of the author, and
authority. the author, or legislator is supposed in every common-wealth
to be evident, because he is the soveraign, who having been constituted
by the [[consent]] of every one, is supposed by every one to be sufficiently
known. and though the ignorance, and security of [[men]] be such, for the
most part, as that when the memory of the first [[constitution]] of their
common-wealth is worn out, they doe not consider, by whose [[power]] they
use to be defended against their enemies [[enemy]], and to have their industry
protected, and to be righted when injury is done them; yet because no
man that considers, can make [[question]] of it, no excuse can be derived
from the ignorance of where the soveraignty is placed. and it is a
dictate of naturall [[reason]], and consequently an evident [[law]] of [[nature]],
that no [[man]] ought to weaken that [[power]], the protection whereof he hath
himself demanded, or wittingly received against others. therefore of
who is soveraign, no [[man]], but by his own [[fault]], (whatsoever evill men
suggest,) can make any [[doubt]]. the difficulty consisteth in the evidence
of the [[authority]] derived from him; the removing whereof, dependeth on
the [[knowledge]] of the publique registers, publique counsels, publique
ministers, and publique seales; by which all lawes are sufficiently
verified.




difference between verifying and authorising

verifyed, i say, not authorised: for the verification, is but the
testimony and record; not the [[authority]] of the [[law]]; which consisteth in
the command of the soveraign only.




the [[law]] verifyed by the subordinate judge

if therefore a [[man]] have a [[question]] of injury, depending on the [[law]] of
nature; that is to say, on [[common]] equity; the sentence of the [[judge]],
that by commission hath [[authority]] to take cognisance of such causes, is
a sufficient verification of the [[law]] of [[nature]] in that individuall case.
for though the [[advice]] of one that professeth the study of the [[law]], be
usefull for the avoyding of contention; yet it is but [[advice]]; tis the
judge must tell [[men]] what is [[law]], upon the hearing of the controversy.




by the publique registers

but when the [[question]] is of injury, or crime, upon a written [[law]]; every
man by recourse to the registers, by himself, or others, may (if he
will) be sufficiently enformed, before he doe such injury, or commit the
crime, whither it be an injury, or not: nay he ought to doe so: for when
a [[man]] doubts [[doubt]] whether the act he goeth about, be just, or injust; and may
informe himself, if he will; the doing is unlawfull. in like manner, he
that supposeth himself injured, in a case determined by the written [[law]],
which he may by himself, or others see and consider; if he complaine
before he consults with the [[law]], he does unjustly, and bewrayeth a
disposition rather to vex other [[men]], than to demand his own [[right]].




by letters patent, and publique seale

if the [[question]] be of [[obedience]] to a publique officer; to have seen his
commission, with the publique seale, and heard it [[read]]; or to have
had the means to be informed of it, if a [[man]] would, is a sufficient
verification of his [[authority]]. for every [[man]] is obliged to doe his best
endeavour, to informe himself of all written lawes, that may concerne
his own future actions.




the interpretation of the [[law]] dependeth on the soveraign power

the legislator known; and the lawes, either by writing, or by the
light of [[nature]], sufficiently published; there wanteth yet another
very materiall circumstance to make them obligatory. for it is not the
letter, but the intendment, or meaning; that is to say, the authentique
interpretation of the [[law]] (which is the sense of the legislator,) in
which the [[nature]] of the [[law]] consisteth; and therefore the interpretation
of all lawes dependeth on the [[authority]] soveraign; and the interpreters
can be none but those, which the soveraign, (to whom only the
subject oweth obedience) shall appoint. for else, by the craft of an
interpreter, the [[law]] my be made to beare a sense, contrary to that of
the soveraign; by which means the interpreter becomes the legislator.




all lawes need interpretation

all laws [[law]], written, and unwritten, have need of interpretation.
the unwritten [[law]] of [[nature]], though it be easy to such, as without
partiality, and passion, make use of their naturall [[reason]], and
therefore leaves the violators thereof without excuse; yet considering
there be very few, perhaps none, that in some cases are not blinded by
self [[love]], or some other passion, it is now become of all laws [[law]] the most
obscure; and has consequently the [[greatest]] need of able interpreters.
the written laws [[law]], if they be short, are easily mis-interpreted, from the
divers significations of a word, or two; if long, they be more obscure
by the diverse significations of many words: in so much as no written
law, delivered in few, or many words, can be well understood, without a
perfect understanding of the finall causes, for which the [[law]] was
made; the [[knowledge]] of which finall causes is in the legislator. to him
therefore there can not be any knot in the [[law]], insoluble; either by
finding out the ends, to undoe it by; or else by making what ends he
will, (as alexander did with his [[sword]] in the gordian knot,) by the
legislative [[power]]; which no other interpreter can doe.




the authenticall interpretation of [[law]] is not that of writers

the interpretation of the lawes of [[nature]], in a common-wealth, dependeth
not on the books [[book]] of morall [[philosophy]]. the [[authority]] of writers, without
the [[authority]] of the common-wealth, maketh not their opinions [[opinion]] [[law]],
be they never so true. that which i have written in this treatise,
concerning the morall vertues, and of their necessity, for the
procuring, and maintaining [[peace]], though it bee evident [[truth]], is not
therefore presently [[law]]; but because in all common-wealths in the [[world]],
it is part of the civill [[law]]: for though it be naturally reasonable; yet
it is by the soveraigne [[power]] that it is [[law]]: otherwise, it were a great
errour, to call the lawes of [[nature]] unwritten [[law]]; whereof wee see
so many volumes published, and in them so many contradictions of one
another, and of themselves.




the interpreter of the [[law]] is the [[judge]] giving sentence vivâ voce in
every particular case

the interpretation of the [[law]] of [[nature]], is the sentence of the judge
constituted by the soveraign [[authority]], to heare and determine such
controversies, as depend thereon; and consisteth in the application of
the [[law]] to the [[present]] case. for in the act of judicature, the judge
doth no more but consider, whither the demand of the party, be consonant
to naturall [[reason]], and equity; and the sentence he giveth, is therefore
the interpretation of the [[law]] of [[nature]]; which interpretation is
authentique; not because it is his private sentence; but because
he giveth it by [[authority]] of the soveraign, whereby it becomes the
soveraigns sentence; which is [[law]] for that [[time]], to the parties
pleading.




the sentence of a [[judge]], does not bind him, or another [[judge]] to give
like sentence in like cases ever after

but because there is no [[judge]] subordinate, nor soveraign, but may erre
in a judgement of equity; if afterward in another like case he find it
more consonant to equity to give a contrary sentence, he is obliged to
doe it. no mans [[man]] error becomes his own [[law]]; nor obliges him to persist
in it. neither (for the same reason) becomes it a [[law]] to other judges [[judge]],
though sworn to [[follow]] it. for though a [[wrong]] sentence given by
authority of the soveraign, if he [[know]] and allow it, in such lawes as
are mutable, be a [[constitution]] of a new [[law]], in cases, in which every
little circumstance is the same; yet in lawes immutable, such as are the
lawes of [[nature]], they are no lawes to the same, or other judges [[judge]], in the
like cases for ever after. princes [[prince]] succeed one another; and one judge
passeth, another commeth; nay, [[heaven]] and [[earth]] shall passe; but not one
title of the [[law]] of [[nature]] shall passe; for it is the eternall [[law]] of
god. therefore all the sentences of precedent judges [[judge]] that have ever
been, cannot all together make a [[law]] contrary to naturall equity: nor
any examples [[example]] of former judges [[judge]], can warrant an unreasonable sentence, or
discharge the [[present]] [[judge]] of the trouble of studying what is equity
(in the case he is to [[judge]],) from the principles [[principle]] of his own naturall
reason. for [[example]] sake, ’tis against the [[law]] of [[nature]], to punish the
innocent; and [[innocent]] is he that acquitteth himselfe judicially, and is
acknowledged for [[innocent]] by the [[judge]]. put the case now, that a [[man]] is
accused of a capitall crime, and seeing the powers [[power]] and malice of some
enemy, and the frequent [[corruption]] and partiality of judges [[judge]], runneth
away for feare of the event, and afterwards is taken, and brought to a
legall triall, and maketh it sufficiently appear, he was not guilty of
the crime, and being thereof acquitted, is neverthelesse condemned to
lose his goods [[good]]; this is a manifest condemnation of the [[innocent]]. i say
therefore, that there is no place in the [[world]], where this can be an
interpretation of a [[law]] of [[nature]], or be made a [[law]] by the sentences of
precedent judges [[judge]], that had done the same. for he that judged it first,
judged unjustly; and no [[injustice]] can be a pattern of judgement to
succeeding judges [[judge]]. a written [[law]] may forbid [[innocent]] [[men]] to fly, and
they may be punished for flying: but that flying for feare of injury,
should be taken for presumption of guilt, after a [[man]] is already
absolved of the crime judicially, is contrary to the [[nature]] of a
presumption, which hath no place after judgement given. yet this is set
down by a [[great]] lawyer for the [[common]] [[law]] of [[england]]. "if a [[man]]," saith
he, "that is [[innocent]], be accused of felony, and for feare flyeth for
the same; albeit he judicially acquitteth himselfe of the felony; yet
if it be found that he fled for the felony, he shall notwithstanding his
innocency, forfeit all his goods [[good]], chattels, debts, and duties [[duty]]. for as
to the forfeiture of them, the [[law]] will admit no proofe against the
presumption in [[law]], grounded upon his flight." here you see, an innocent
man, judicially acquitted, notwithstanding his innocency, (when no
written [[law]] forbad him to fly) after his acquitall, upon a presumption
in [[law]], condemned to lose all the goods [[good]] he hath. if the [[law]] ground upon
his flight a presumption of the [[fact]], (which was capitall,) the sentence
ought to have been capitall: if the presumption were not of the [[fact]],
for what then ought he to lose his goods [[good]]? this therefore is no [[law]] of
england; nor is the condemnation grounded upon a presumption of [[law]], but
upon the presumption of the judges [[judge]]. it is also against [[law]], to say
that no proofe shall be admitted against a presumption of [[law]]. for
all judges [[judge]], soveraign and subordinate, if they refuse to heare proofe,
refuse to do [[justice]]: for though the sentence be just, yet the judges
that condemn without hearing the proofes offered, are [[unjust]] judges [[judge]]; and
their presumption is but prejudice; which no [[man]] ought to bring with him
to the seat of [[justice]], whatsoever precedent judgements, or examples [[example]] he
shall pretend to [[follow]]. there be other things of this [[nature]], wherein
mens judgements have been perverted, by trusting to precedents: but this
is enough to shew, that though the sentence of the [[judge]], be a [[law]] to
the party pleading, yet it is no [[law]] to any [[judge]], that shall succeed
him in that office.

in like manner, when [[question]] is of the meaning of written lawes, he is
not the interpreter of them, that writeth a commentary upon them. for
commentaries are commonly more [[subject]] to cavill, than the text; and
therefore need other commentaries; and so there will be no end of such
interpretation. and therefore unlesse there be an interpreter authorised
by the soveraign, from which the subordinate judges [[judge]] are not to recede,
the interpreter can be no other than the ordinary judges [[judge]], in the some
manner, as they are in cases of the unwritten [[law]]; and their sentences
are to be taken by them that plead, for lawes in that particular case;
but not to bind other judges [[judge]], in like cases to give like judgements.
for a [[judge]] may erre in the interpretation even of written lawes; but no
errour of a subordinate [[judge]], can [[change]] the [[law]], which is the generall
sentence of the soveraigne.




the difference between the letter and sentence of the law

in written lawes, [[men]] use to make a difference between the letter, and
the sentence of the [[law]]: and when by the letter, is meant whatsoever
can be gathered from the bare words, ’tis well distinguished. for the
significations of almost all words, are either in themselves, or in the
metaphoricall use of them, ambiguous; and may be drawn in argument, to
make many senses; but there is onely one sense of the [[law]]. but if by the
letter, be meant the literall sense, then the letter, and the sentence
or intention of the [[law]], is all one. for the literall sense is that,
which the legislator is alwayes supposed to be equity: for it were a
great contumely for a [[judge]] to [[think]] otherwise of the soveraigne.
he ought therefore, if the word of the [[law]] doe not fully authorise a
reasonable sentence, to supply it with the [[law]] of [[nature]]; or if the
case be difficult, to respit judgement till he have received more ample
authority. for [[example]], a written [[law]] ordaineth, that he which is thrust
out of his house by [[force]], shall be restored by [[force]]: it happens that
a [[man]] by negligence leaves his house empty, and returning is kept out by
force, in which case there is no speciall [[law]] ordained. it is evident,
that this case is contained in the same [[law]]: for else there is no remedy
for him at all; which is to be supposed against the intention of the
legislator. again, the word of the [[law]], commandeth to [[judge]] according
to the evidence: a [[man]] is accused falsly of a [[fact]], which the [[judge]] saw
himself done by another; and not by him that is accused. in this case
neither shall the letter of the [[law]] be followed to the condemnation of
the [[innocent]], nor shall the [[judge]] give sentence against the evidence
of the witnesses; because the letter of the [[law]] is to the contrary:
but procure of the soveraign that another be made [[judge]], and himselfe
witnesse. so that the incommodity that follows the bare words of a
written [[law]], may lead him to the intention of the [[law]], whereby to
interpret the same the [[better]]; though no incommodity can warrant a
sentence against the [[law]]. for every [[judge]] of [[right]], and [[wrong]], is not
judge of what is commodious, or incommodious to the common-wealth.




the abilities required in a judge

the abilities required in a [[good]] interpreter of the [[law]], that is to say,
in a [[good]] [[judge]], are not the same with those of an advocate; namely the
study of the lawes. for a [[judge]], as he ought to take notice of the [[fact]],
from none but the witnesses; so also he ought to take notice of the
law, from nothing but the statutes, and constitutions [[constitution]] of the soveraign,
alledged in the pleading, or declared to him by some that have authority
from the soveraign [[power]] to declare them; and need not take care
before-hand, what hee shall [[judge]]; for it shall bee given him what hee
shall say concerning the [[fact]], by witnesses; and what hee shall say in
point of [[law]], from those that shall in their pleadings shew it, and by
authority interpret it upon the place. the lords [[lord]] of parlament in england
were judges [[judge]], and most difficult causes have been heard and determined
by them; yet few of them were much versed in the study of the lawes,
and fewer had made profession of them: and though they consulted with
lawyers, that were appointed to be [[present]] there for that [[purpose]]; yet
they alone had the [[authority]] of giving sentence. in like manner, in
the ordinary trialls of [[right]], twelve [[men]] of the [[common]] [[people]], are the
judges, and give sentence, not onely of the [[fact]], but of the [[right]]; and
pronounce simply for the complaynant, or for the defendant; that is to
say, are judges [[judge]] not onely of the [[fact]], but also of the [[right]]: and in a
question of crime, not onely determine whether done, or not done; but
also whether it be murder, homicide, felony, assault, and the like,
which are determinations of [[law]]: but because they are not supposed to
know the [[law]] of themselves, there is one that hath [[authority]] to enforme
them of it, in the particular case they are to [[judge]] of. but yet if they
judge not according to that he tells them, they are not [[subject]] thereby
to any penalty; unlesse it be made appear, they did it against their
consciences, or had been corrupted by [[reward]]. the things that make
a [[good]] [[judge]], or [[good]] interpreter of the lawes, are, first a right
understanding of that principall [[law]] of [[nature]] called equity; which
depending not on the reading of other mens [[men]] writings, but on the
goodnesse of a mans [[man]] own naturall [[reason]], and meditation, is presumed
to be in those most, that have had most leisure, and had the most
inclination to meditate thereon. secondly, contempt of unnecessary
riches, and preferments. thirdly, to be able in judgement to devest
himselfe of all feare, anger, [[hatred]], [[love]], and compassion. fourthly,
and lastly, patience to heare; diligent attention in hearing; and memory
to retain, digest and apply what he hath heard.




divisions of law

the difference and division of the lawes, has been made in divers
manners, according to the different methods, of those [[men]] that have
written of them. for it is a thing that dependeth not on [[nature]], but on
the scope of the writer; and is subservient to every mans [[man]] proper method.
in the [[institutions]] of justinian, we find seven sorts of civill lawes.

1. the edicts, constitutions [[constitution]], and epistles of the [[prince]], that is, of
the emperour; because the whole [[power]] of the [[people]] was in him. like
these, are the proclamations of the kings [[king]] of [[england]].

2. the decrees of the whole [[people]] of [[rome]] (comprehending the senate,)
when they were put to the [[question]] by the senate. these were lawes, at
first, by the vertue of the soveraign [[power]] residing in the [[people]]; and
such of them as by the emperours were not abrogated, remained lawes by
the [[authority]] imperiall. for all lawes that bind, are understood to be
lawes by his [[authority]] that has [[power]] to repeale them. somewhat like to
these lawes, are the acts of [[parliament]] in [[england]].

3. the decrees of the [[common]] [[people]] (excluding the senate,) when they
were put to the [[question]] by the tribune of the [[people]]. for such of them
as were not abrogated by the emperours, remained lawes by the authority
imperiall. like to these, were the orders of the house of commons [[common]] in
england.

4. senatus consulta, the orders of the senate; because when the people
of [[rome]] grew so numerous, as it was inconvenient to assemble them; it
was [[thought]] fit by the emperour, that [[men]] should consult the senate in
stead of the [[people]]: and these have some resemblance with the acts of
counsell.

5. the edicts of praetors, and (in some cases) of the aediles: such as
are the chiefe justices in the courts of [[england]].

6. responsa prudentum; which were the sentences, and opinions [[opinion]] of those
lawyers, to whom the emperour gave [[authority]] to interpret the [[law]], and
to give [[answer]] to such as in matter of [[law]] demanded their [[advice]];
which answers [[answer]], the judges [[judge]] in giving judgement were obliged by the
constitutions of the emperour to observe; and should be like the reports
of cases judged, if other judges [[judge]] be by the [[law]] of [[england]] bound to
observe them. for the judges [[judge]] of the [[common]] [[law]] of [[england]], are not
properly judges [[judge]], but juris consulti; of whom the judges [[judge]], who are either
the lords [[lord]], or twelve [[men]] of the [[country]], are in point of [[law]] to ask
advice.

7. also, unwritten customes, (which in their own [[nature]] are an imitation
of [[law]],) by the tacite [[consent]] of the emperour, in case they be not
contrary to the [[law]] of [[nature]], are very lawes.

another division of lawes, is into naturall and positive. naturall are
those which have been lawes from all eternity; and are called not onely
naturall, but also morall lawes; consisting in the morall vertues, as
justice, equity, and all habits of the [[mind]] that conduce to [[peace]], and
charity; of which i have already spoken in the fourteenth and fifteenth
chapters.

positive, are those which have not been for eternity; but have been
made lawes by the will of those that have had the soveraign [[power]] over
others; and are either written, or made known to [[men]], by some other
argument of the will of their legislator.




another division of law

again, of positive lawes some are humane, some [[divine]]; and of humane
positive lawes, some are distributive, some penal. distributive are
those that determine the rights [[right]] of the subjects [[subject]], declaring to every man
what it is, by which he acquireth and holdeth a propriety in lands [[land]],
or goods [[good]], and a [[right]] or [[liberty]] of action; and these speak to all
the subjects [[subject]]. penal are those, which declare, what penalty shall be
inflicted on those that violate the [[law]]; and speak to the ministers
and officers ordained for execution. for though every one ought to be
informed of the punishments [[punishment]] ordained beforehand for their transgression;
neverthelesse the command is not addressed to the delinquent, (who
cannot be supposed will faithfully punish himselfe,) but to publique
ministers appointed to see the penalty executed. and these penal lawes
are for the most part written together with the lawes distributive; and
are sometimes called judgements. for all lawes are generall judgements,
or sentences of the legislator; as also every particular judgement, is a
law to him, whose case is judged.




divine positive [[law]] how made known to be law

divine positive lawes (for naturall lawes being eternall, and
universall, are all [[divine]],) are those, which being the commandements of
god, (not from all eternity, nor universally addressed to all [[men]], but
onely to a [[certain]] [[people]], or to [[certain]] persons [[person]],) are declared for
such, by those whom [[god]] hath authorised to declare them. but this
authority of [[man]] to declare what be these positive lawes of [[god]], how can
it be known? [[god]] may command a [[man]] by a supernaturall way, to deliver
lawes to other [[men]]. but because it is of the essence of [[law]], that he who
is to be obliged, be assured of the [[authority]] of him that declareth
it, which we cannot naturally take notice to be from [[god]], how can a man
without supernaturall revelation be assured of the revelation received
by the declarer? and how can he be bound to obey them? for the first
question, how a [[man]] can be assured of the revelation of another, without
a revelation particularly to himselfe, it is evidently impossible:
for though a [[man]] may be induced to [[believe]] such revelation, from the
miracles they see him doe, or from seeing the extraordinary [[sanctity]] of
his [[life]], or from seeing the extraordinary wisedome, or extraordinary
felicity of his actions, all which are marks of gods extraordinary
favour; yet they are not assured evidence of speciall revelation.
miracles are marvellous workes: but that which is marvellous to one,
may not be so to another. [[sanctity]] may be feigned; and the visible
felicities of this [[world]], are most often the [[work]] of [[god]] by naturall,
and ordinary causes. and therefore no [[man]] can infallibly [[know]] by
naturall [[reason]], that another has had a supernaturall revelation of gods
will; but only a beliefe; every one (as the signs thereof shall appear
greater, or lesser) a firmer, or a weaker [[belief]].

but for the second, how he can be bound to obey them; it is not so hard.
for if the [[law]] declared, be not against the [[law]] of [[nature]] (which is
undoubtedly gods law) and he undertake to obey it, he is bound by his
own act; bound i say to obey it, but not bound to [[believe]] it: for mens
beliefe, and interiour cogitations, are not [[subject]] to the commands,
but only to the operation of [[god]], ordinary, or extraordinary. [[faith]] of
supernaturall [[law]], is not a fulfilling, but only an assenting to the
same; and not a [[duty]] that we exhibite to [[god]], but a gift which god
freely giveth to whom he pleaseth; as also unbelief is not a breach
of any of his lawes; but a rejection of them all, except the lawes
naturall. but this that i say, will be made yet cleerer, by the
examples, and testimonies concerning this point in holy [[scripture]]. the
covenant [[god]] made with [[abraham]] (in a supernaturall manner) was thus,
(gen. 17. 10) "this is the covenant which thou shalt observe between
me and thee and thy seed after thee." abrahams seed had not this
revelation, nor were yet in being; yet they are a party to the covenant,
and bound to obey what [[abraham]] should declare to them for gods [[law]];
which they could not be, but in vertue of the [[obedience]] they owed to
their parents; who (if they be [[subject]] to no other earthly [[power]], as
here in the case of abraham) have soveraign [[power]] over their [[children]],
and servants. againe, where [[god]] saith to [[abraham]], "in thee shall all
nations of the [[earth]] be blessed: for i [[know]] thou wilt command thy
children, and thy house after thee to keep the way of the [[lord]], and to
observe righteousnesse and judgement," it is manifest, the [[obedience]] of
his [[family]], who had no revelation, depended on their former obligation
to obey their soveraign. at mount sinai [[moses]] only went up to [[god]]; the
people were forbidden to approach on paine of [[death]]; yet were they bound
to obey all that [[moses]] declared to them for gods [[law]]. upon what ground,
but on this submission of their own, "speak thou to us, and we will
heare thee; but let not [[god]] speak to us, lest we dye?" by which two
places it sufficiently appeareth, that in a common-wealth, a subject
that has no [[certain]] and assured revelation particularly to himself
concerning the will of [[god]], is to obey for such, the command of
the common-wealth: for if [[men]] were at [[liberty]], to take for gods
commandements, their own dreams [[dream]], and fancies, or the dreams [[dream]] and
fancies of private [[men]]; scarce two [[men]] would agree upon what is gods
commandement; and yet in [[respect]] of them, every [[man]] would despise the
commandements of the common-wealth. i conclude therefore, that in all
things not contrary to the morall [[law]], (that is to say, to the [[law]] of
nature,) all subjects [[subject]] are bound to obey that for [[divine]] [[law]], which is
declared to be so, by the lawes of the common-wealth. which also is
evident to any mans [[man]] [[reason]]; for whatsoever is not against the [[law]] of
nature, may be made [[law]] in the name of them that have the soveraign
power; and there is no [[reason]] [[men]] should be the lesse obliged by it,
when tis propounded in the name of [[god]]. besides, there is no place in
the [[world]] where [[men]] are permitted to pretend other commandements of [[god]],
than are declared for such by the common-wealth. [[christian]] states punish
those that revolt from [[christian]] [[religion]], and all other states, those
that set up any [[religion]] by them forbidden. for in whatsoever is not
regulated by the common-wealth, tis equity (which is the [[law]] of [[nature]],
and therefore an eternall [[law]] of god) that every [[man]] equally enjoy his
liberty.




another division of lawes

there is also another distinction of laws [[law]], into fundamentall, and not
fundamentall: but i could never see in any author, what a fundamentall
law signifieth. neverthelesse one may very reasonably distinguish laws
in that manner.




a fundamentall [[law]] what

for a fundamentall [[law]] in every common-wealth is that, which being taken
away, the common-wealth faileth, and is utterly dissolved; as a building
whose foundation is destroyed. and therefore a fundamentall [[law]] is that,
by which subjects [[subject]] are bound to uphold whatsoever [[power]] is given to the
soveraign, whether a monarch, or a soveraign assembly, without which the
common-wealth cannot stand, such as is the [[power]] of [[war]] and [[peace]], of
judicature, of election of officers, and of doing whatsoever he shall
think necessary for the publique [[good]]. not fundamentall is that
the abrogating whereof, draweth not with it the dissolution of the
common-wealth; such as are the lawes concerning controversies between
subject and [[subject]]. thus much of the division of lawes.




difference between [[law]] and right

i find the words lex civilis, and jus civile, that is to say, [[law]] and
right civil, promiscuously used for the same thing, even in the most
learned authors; which neverthelesse ought not to be so. for [[right]] is
liberty, namely that [[liberty]] which the civil [[law]] leaves us: but civill
law is an obligation; and takes from us the [[liberty]] which the [[law]] of
nature gave us. [[nature]] gave a [[right]] to every [[man]] to secure himselfe
by his own [[strength]], and to invade a suspected neighbour, by way of
prevention; but the civill [[law]] takes away that [[liberty]], in all cases
where the protection of the lawe may be safely stayd for. insomuch as
lex and jus, are as different as obligation and [[liberty]].




and between a [[law]] and a charter

likewise lawes and charters are taken promiscuously for the same
thing. yet charters are donations of the soveraign; and not lawes, but
exemptions from [[law]]. the phrase of a [[law]] is jubeo, injungo, i command,
and enjoyn: the phrase of a charter is dedi, concessi, i have given, i
have granted: but what is given or granted, to a [[man]], is not forced
upon him, by a [[law]]. a [[law]] may be made to bind all the subjects [[subject]] of a
common-wealth: a [[liberty]], or charter is only to one [[man]], or some one
part of the [[people]]. for to say all the [[people]] of a common-wealth, have
liberty in any case whatsoever; is to say, that in such case, there hath
been no [[law]] made; or else having been made, is now abrogated.



chapter xxvii. of crimes, excuses, and extenuations



sinne what

a sinne, is not onely a transgression of a [[law]], but also any contempt of
the legislator. for such contempt, is a breach of all his lawes at once.
and therefore may consist, not onely in the commission of a [[fact]], or in
the speaking of words by the lawes forbidden, or in the omission of
what the [[law]] commandeth, but also in the intention, or [[purpose]] to
transgresse. for the [[purpose]] to breake the [[law]], is some [[degree]] of
contempt of him, to whom it belongeth to see it executed. to be
delighted in the [[imagination]] onely, of being possessed of another mans
goods, servants, or [[wife]], without any intention to take them from him
by [[force]], or fraud, is no breach of the [[law]], that sayth, "thou shalt not
covet:" nor is the [[pleasure]] a [[man]] my have in imagining, or dreaming of
the [[death]] of him, from whose [[life]] he expecteth nothing but dammage, and
displeasure, a sinne; but the resolving to put some act in execution,
that tendeth thereto. for to be pleased in the fiction of that, which
would please a [[man]] if it were reall, is a passion so adhaerent to the
nature both of a [[man]], and every other living creature, as to make it a
sinne, were to make sinne of being a [[man]]. the consideration of this,
has made me [[think]] them too severe, both to themselves, and others, that
maintain, that the first motions of the [[mind]], (though checked with the
fear of god) be sinnes. but i confesse it is safer to erre on that hand,
than on the other.




a crime what

a crime, is a sinne, consisting in the committing (by deed, or word)
of that which the [[law]] forbiddeth, or the omission of what it hath
commanded. so that every crime is a sinne; but not every sinne a crime.
to intend to steale, or kill, is a sinne, though it never appeare in
word, or [[fact]]: for [[god]] that seeth the thoughts [[thought]] of [[man]], can lay it to
his charge: but till it appear by some thing done, or said, by which
the intention may be crime; which distinction the greeks [[greek]] observed in
the word amartema, and egklema, or aitia; wherof the former, (which is
translated sinne,) signifieth any swarving from the [[law]] whatsoever; but
the two later, (which are translated crime,) signifie that sinne onely,
whereof one [[man]] may accuse another. but of intentions, which never
appear by any outward act, there is no place for humane accusation. in
like manner the latines by peccatum, which is sinne, signifie all manner
of deviation from the [[law]]; but by crimen, (which word they derive from
cerno, which signifies to perceive,) they mean onely such sinnes, as my
be made appear before a [[judge]]; and therfore are not meer intentions.




where no civill [[law]] is, there is no crime

from this relation of sinne to the [[law]], and of crime to the civill
law, may be inferred, first, that where [[law]] ceaseth, sinne ceaseth.
but because the [[law]] of [[nature]] is eternall, violation of covenants,
ingratitude, arrogance, and all facts [[fact]] contrary to any morall vertue, can
never cease to be sinne. secondly, that the civill [[law]] ceasing, crimes
cease: for there being no other [[law]] remaining, but that of [[nature]], there
is no place for accusation; every [[man]] being his own [[judge]], and accused
onely by his own [[conscience]], and cleared by the uprightnesse of his own
intention. when therefore his intention is [[right]], his [[fact]] is no sinne:
if otherwise, his [[fact]] is sinne; but not crime. thirdly, that when the
soveraign [[power]] ceaseth, crime also ceaseth: for where there is no such
power, there is no protection to be had from the [[law]]; and therefore
every one may [[protect]] himself by his own [[power]]: for no [[man]] in the
institution of soveraign [[power]] can be supposed to give away the right
of preserving his own [[body]]; for the safety whereof all soveraignty was
ordained. but this is to be understood onely of those, that have not
themselves contributed to the taking away of the [[power]] that protected
them: for that was a crime from the beginning.




ignorance of the [[law]] of [[nature]] excuseth no man

the source of every crime, is some defect of the understanding; or some
errour in reasoning, or some sudden [[force]] of the [[passions]]. defect in
the understanding, is ignorance; in reasoning, erroneous [[opinion]]. again,
ignorance is of three sort; of the [[law]], and of the soveraign, and of the
penalty. ignorance of the [[law]] of [[nature]] excuseth no [[man]]; because every
man that hath attained to the use of [[reason]], is supposed to [[know]], he
ought not to do to another, what he would not have done to himselfe.
therefore into what place soever a [[man]] shall come, if he do any thing
contrary to that [[law]], it is a crime. if a [[man]] come from the indies
hither, and perswade [[men]] here to receive a new [[religion]], or [[teach]] them
any thing that tendeth to disobedience of the lawes of this [[country]],
though he be never so well perswaded of the [[truth]] of what he teacheth,
he commits a crime, and may be justly punished for the same, not onely
because his doctrine is false, but also because he does that which he
would not approve in another, namely, that comming from hence, he should
endeavour to alter the [[religion]] there. but ignorance of the civill [[law]],
shall excuse a [[man]] in a [[strange]] [[country]], till it be declared to him;
because, till then no civill [[law]] is binding.




ignorance of the civill [[law]] excuseth sometimes

in the like manner, if the civill [[law]] of a mans [[man]] own [[country]], be not
so sufficiently declared, as he may [[know]] it if he will; nor the action
against the [[law]] of [[nature]]; the ignorance is a [[good]] excuse: in other
cases ignorance of the civill [[law]], excuseth not.




ignorance of the soveraign excuseth not

ignorance of the soveraign [[power]], in the place of a mans [[man]] ordinary
residence, excuseth him not; because he ought to take notice of the
power, by which he hath been protected there.




ignorance of the penalty excuseth not

ignorance of the penalty, where the [[law]] is declared, excuseth no [[man]]:
for in breaking the [[law]], which without a [[fear]] of penalty to [[follow]], were
not a [[law]], but [[vain]] words, he undergoeth the penalty, though he [[know]] not
what it is; because, whosoever voluntarily doth any action, accepteth
all the known consequences of it; but [[punishment]] is a known consequence
of the violation of the lawes, in every common-wealth; which [[punishment]],
if it be determined already by the [[law]], he is [[subject]] to that; if not,
then is he [[subject]] to arbitrary [[punishment]]. for it is [[reason]], that he
which does injury, without other limitation than that of his own will,
should suffer [[punishment]] without other limitation, than that of his will
whose [[law]] is thereby violated.




punishments declared before the [[fact]], excuse from greater punishments
after it

but when a penalty, is either annexed to the crime in the [[law]] it selfe,
or hath been usually inflicted in the like cases; there the delinquent
is excused from a greater penalty. for the [[punishment]] foreknown, if not
great enough to deterre [[men]] from the action, is an invitement to it:
because when [[men]] compare the benefit of their [[injustice]], with the harm
of their [[punishment]], by necessity of [[nature]] they choose that which
appeareth [[best]] for themselves; and therefore when they are punished more
than the [[law]] had formerly determined, or more than others were punished
for the same crime; it the [[law]] that tempted, and deceiveth them.




nothing can be made a crime by a [[law]] made after the fact

no [[law]], made after a [[fact]] done, can make it a crime: because if the
fact be against the [[law]] of [[nature]], the [[law]] was before the [[fact]]; and a
positive [[law]] cannot be taken notice of, before it be made; and therefore
cannot be obligatory. but when the [[law]] that forbiddeth a [[fact]], is made
before the [[fact]] be done; yet he that doth the [[fact]], is lyable to the
penalty ordained after, in case no lesser penalty were made known
before, neither by writing, nor by [[example]], for the [[reason]] immediatly
before alledged.




false principles [[principle]] of [[right]] and [[wrong]] causes of crime

from defect in reasoning, (that is to say, from errour,) [[men]] are prone
to violate the lawes, three wayes. first, by presumption of false
principles; as when [[men]] from having observed how in all places, and
in all ages [[age]], [[unjust]] actions have been authorised, by the [[force]], and
victories of those who have committed them; and that potent [[men]],
breaking through the cob-web lawes of their [[country]], the weaker sort,
and those that have failed in their enterprises, have been esteemed the
onely criminals [[criminal]]; have thereupon taken for principles [[principle]], and grounds of
their reasoning, "that [[justice]] is but a [[vain]] word: that whatsoever a man
can get by his own industry, and hazard, is his own: that the practice
of all nations cannot be [[unjust]]: that examples [[example]] of former times [[time]] are good
arguments of doing the like again;" and many more of that [[kind]]: which
being granted, no act in it selfe can be a crime, but must be made so
(not by the [[law]], but) by the successe of them that commit it; and the
same [[fact]] be vertuous, or vicious, as [[fortune]] pleaseth; so that what
marius makes a crime, sylla shall make meritorious, and caesar (the same
lawes standing) turn again into a crime, to the perpetuall disturbance
of the [[peace]] of the common-wealth.




false teachers mis-interpreting the [[law]] of [[nature]] secondly, by false
teachers, that either mis-interpret the [[law]] of [[nature]], making it thereby
repugnant to the [[law]] civill; or by teaching for lawes, such doctrines of
their own, or traditions of former times [[time]], as are inconsistent with the
duty of a [[subject]].




and false inferences from true principles [[principle]], by teachers

thirdly, by erroneous inferences from true principles [[principle]]; which happens
commonly to [[men]] that are hasty, and praecipitate in concluding, and
resolving what to do; such as are they, that have both a [[great]] opinion
of their own understanding, and [[believe]] that things of this nature
require not [[time]] and study, but onely [[common]] [[experience]], and a good
naturall wit; whereof no [[man]] thinks [[think]] himselfe unprovided: whereas the
knowledge, of [[right]] and [[wrong]], which is no lesse difficult, there is no
man will pretend to, without [[great]] and long study. and of those defects
in reasoning, there is none that can excuse (though some of them may
extenuate) a crime, in any [[man]], that pretendeth to the administration of
his own private businesse; much lesse in them that undertake a publique
charge; because they pretend to the [[reason]], upon the want whereof they
would ground their excuse.




by their [[passions]];

of the [[passions]] that most frequently are the causes of crime, one,
is vain-glory, or a foolish over-rating of their own worth; as if
difference of worth, were an effect of their wit, or riches [[rich]], or bloud,
or some other naturall quality, not depending on the will of those that
have the soveraign [[authority]]. from whence proceedeth a presumption that
the punishments [[punishment]] ordained by the lawes, and extended generally to all
subjects, ought not to be inflicted on them, with the same rigour they
are inflicted on poore, obscure, and simple [[men]], comprehended under the
name of the vulgar.




presumption of riches

therefore it happeneth commonly, that such as value themselves by the
greatnesse of their [[wealth]], adventure on crimes, upon [[hope]] of escaping
punishment, by corrupting publique [[justice]], or obtaining pardon by mony,
or other rewards [[reward]].




and friends

and that such as have multitude of potent kindred; and popular [[men]], that
have gained [[reputation]] amongst the multitude, take [[courage]] to violate
the lawes, from a [[hope]] of oppressing the [[power]], to whom it belongeth to
put them in execution.




wisedome

and that such as have a [[great]], and false [[opinion]] of their own wisedome,
take upon them to reprehend the actions, and call in [[question]] the
authority of them that govern, and so to unsettle the lawes with their
publique discourse, as that nothing shall be a crime, but what their own
designes require should be so. it happeneth also to the same [[men]], to be
prone to all such crimes, as consist in craft, and in deceiving of their
neighbours; because they [[think]] their designes are too subtile to be
perceived. these i say are effects of a false presumption of their own
wisdome. for of them that are the first movers in the disturbance of
common-wealth, (which can never happen without a civill warre,) very few
are left alive long enough, to see their new designes established: so
that the benefit of their crimes, redoundeth to [[posterity]], and such as
would least have wished it: which argues they were not as [[wise]], as
they [[thought]] they were. and those that [[deceive]] upon [[hope]] of not being
observed, do commonly [[deceive]] themselves, (the darknesse in which they
believe they lye hidden, being nothing else but their own blindnesse;)
and are no wiser than [[children]], that [[think]] all hid, by hiding their own
eyes.

and generally all vain-glorious [[men]], (unlesse they be withall timorous,)
are [[subject]] to anger; as being more prone than others to interpret for
contempt, the ordinary [[liberty]] of conversation: and there are few crimes
that may not be produced by anger.




hatred, [[lust]], [[ambition]], covetousnesse, causes of crime

as for the [[passions]], of hate, [[lust]], [[ambition]], and covetousnesse, what
crimes they are apt to [[produce]], is so obvious to every mans [[man]] experience
and understanding, as there needeth nothing to be said of them, saving
that they are infirmities, so annexed to the [[nature]], both of [[man]], and
all other living creatures, as that their effects cannot be hindred,
but by extraordinary use of [[reason]], or a constant severity in punishing
them. for in those things [[men]] hate, they find a continuall, and
unavoydable molestation; whereby either a mans [[man]] patience must be
everlasting, or he must be eased by removing the [[power]] of that which
molesteth him; the former is difficult; the later is many times
impossible, without some violation of the [[law]]. [[ambition]], and
covetousnesse are [[passions]] also that are perpetually incumbent, and
pressing; whereas [[reason]] is not perpetually [[present]], to resist them:
and therefore whensoever the [[hope]] of impunity appears, their effects
proceed. and for [[lust]], what it wants in the lasting, it hath in the
vehemence, which sufficeth to weigh down the apprehension of all easie,
or uncertain punishments [[punishment]].




fear sometimes cause of crime, as when the danger is neither [[present]],
nor corporeall

of all [[passions]], that which enclineth [[men]] least to break the lawes, is
fear. nay, (excepting some generous natures [[nature]],) it is the onely thing,
(when there is apparence of [[profit]], or [[pleasure]] by breaking the lawes,)
that makes [[men]] keep them. and yet in many cases a crime may be committed
through feare.

for not every [[fear]] justifies the action it produceth, but the [[fear]] onely
of corporeall hurt, which we call bodily [[fear]], and from which a man
cannot see how to be delivered, but by the action. a [[man]] is assaulted,
fears [[present]] [[death]], from which he sees not how to escape, but by
wounding him that assaulteth him; if he wound him to [[death]], this is no
crime; because no [[man]] is supposed at the making of a common-wealth, to
have abandoned the defence of his [[life]], or limbes, where the [[law]] cannot
arrive [[time]] enough to his assistance. but to kill a [[man]], because from
his actions, or his threatnings, i may argue he will kill me when he
can, (seeing i have [[time]], and means to demand protection, from the
soveraign [[power]],) is a crime. again, a [[man]] receives words of disgrace,
or some little injuries (for which they that made the lawes, had
assigned no [[punishment]], nor [[thought]] it worthy of a [[man]] that hath the use
of [[reason]], to take notice of,) and is afraid, unlesse he [[revenge]] it,
he shall fall into contempt, and consequently be obnoxious to the like
injuries from others; and to avoyd this, breaks the [[law]], and protects
himselfe for the future, by the terrour of his private [[revenge]]. this is
a crime; for the hurt is not corporeall, but phantasticall, and (though
in this corner of the [[world]], made sensible by a custome not many years
since begun, amongst [[young]] and [[vain]] [[men]],) so [[light]], as a gallant [[man]],
and one that is assured of his own [[courage]], cannot take notice of. also
a [[man]] may stand in [[fear]] of spirits, either through his own superstition,
or through too much credit given to other [[men]], that tell him of strange
dreams and visions; and thereby be made [[believe]] they will hurt him, for
doing, or omitting divers things, which neverthelesse, to do, or omit,
is contrary to the lawes; and that which is so done, or omitted, is not
to be excused by this [[fear]]; but is a crime. for (as i have shewn before
in the second chapter) dreams [[dream]] be naturally but the fancies remaining in
sleep, after the impressions our senses had formerly received waking;
and when [[men]] are by any accident unassured they have slept, seem to be
reall visions; and therefore he that presumes to break the [[law]] upon his
own, or anothers [[dream]], or pretended vision, or upon other fancy of
the [[power]] of invisible spirits, than is permitted by the common-wealth,
leaveth the [[law]] of [[nature]], which is a [[certain]] offence, and followeth the
imagery of his own, or another private mans [[man]] brain, which he can never
know whether it signifieth any thing, or nothing, nor whether he that
tells his [[dream]], say true, or lye; which if every private [[man]] should
have leave to do, (as they must by the [[law]] of [[nature]], if any one have
it) there could no [[law]] be made to hold, and so all common-wealth would
be dissolved.




crimes not equall

from these different sources of crimes, it appeares already, that all
crimes are not (as the stoicks of old [[time]] maintained) of the same
allay. there is place, not only for excuse, by which that which seemed
a crime, is proved to be none at all; but also for extenuation, by which
the crime, that seemed [[great]], is made lesse. for though all crimes doe
equally deserve the name of [[injustice]], as all deviation from a strait
line is equally crookednesse, which the stoicks rightly observed; yet
it does not [[follow]] that all crimes are equally [[unjust]], no more than that
all crooked lines are equally crooked; which the stoicks not observing,
held it as [[great]] a crime, to kill a hen, against the [[law]], as to kill
ones [[father]].




totall excuses

that which totally excuseth a [[fact]], and takes away from it the [[nature]] of
a crime, can be none but that, which at the same [[time]], taketh away the
obligation of the [[law]]. for the [[fact]] committed once against the [[law]],
if he that committed it be obliged to the [[law]], can be no other than a
crime.

the want of means to [[know]] the [[law]], totally excuseth: for the [[law]] whereof
a [[man]] has no means to enforme himself, is not obligatory. but the want
of diligence to enquire, shall not be considered as a want of means; nor
shall any [[man]], that pretendeth to [[reason]] enough for the [[government]] of
his own affairs, be supposed to want means to [[know]] the lawes of [[nature]];
because they are known by the [[reason]] he pretends to: only [[children]], and
madmen are excused from offences against the [[law]] naturall.

where a [[man]] is captive, or in the [[power]] of the [[enemy]], (and he is then in
the [[power]] of the [[enemy]], when his [[person]], or his means of living, is
so,) if it be without his own [[fault]], the obligation of the [[law]] ceaseth;
because he must obey the [[enemy]], or dye; and consequently such obedience
is no crime: for no [[man]] is obliged (when the protection of the law
faileth,) not to [[protect]] himself, by the [[best]] means he can.

if a [[man]] by the terrour of [[present]] [[death]], be compelled to doe a fact
against the [[law]], he is totally excused; because no [[law]] can oblige a
man to abandon his own preservation. and supposing such a [[law]] were
obligatory; yet a [[man]] would [[reason]] thus, "if i doe it not, i die
presently; if i doe it, i [[die]] afterwards; therefore by doing it, there
is [[time]] of [[life]] gained;" [[nature]] therefore compells him to the [[fact]].

when a [[man]] is destitute of food, or other thing necessary for his [[life]],
and cannot preserve himselfe any other way, but by some [[fact]] against
the [[law]]; as if in a [[great]] famine he take the food by [[force]], or stealth,
which he cannot obtaine for mony nor charity; or in defence of his [[life]],
snatch away another mans [[man]] [[sword]], he is totally excused, for the reason
next before alledged.




excuses against the author

again, facts [[fact]] done against the [[law]], by the [[authority]] of another, are
by that [[authority]] excused against the author; because no [[man]] ought to
accuse his own [[fact]] in another, that is but his instrument: but it
is not excused against a third [[person]] thereby injured; because in the
violation of the [[law]], bothe the author, and actor are criminalls.
from hence it followeth that when that [[man]], or assembly, that hath the
soveraign [[power]], commandeth a [[man]] to do that which is contrary to a
former [[law]], the doing of it is totally excused: for he ought not to
condemn it himselfe, because he is the author; and what cannot justly
be condemned by the soveraign, cannot justly be punished by any other.
besides, when the soveraign commandeth any thing to be done against
his own former [[law]], the command, as to that particular [[fact]], is an
abrogation of the [[law]].

if that [[man]], or assembly, that hath the soveraign [[power]], disclaime
any [[right]] essentiall to the soveraignty, whereby there accrueth to the
subject, any [[liberty]] inconsistent with the soveraign [[power]], that is to
say, with the very being of a common-wealth, if the [[subject]] shall refuse
to obey the command in any thing, contrary to the [[liberty]] granted, this
is neverthelesse a sinne, and contrary to the [[duty]] of the [[subject]]: for
he ought to take notice of what is inconsistent with the soveraignty,
because it was erected by his own [[consent]], and for his own defence;
and that such [[liberty]] as is inconsistent with it, was granted through
ignorance of the evill consequence thereof. but if he not onely disobey,
but also resist a publique minister in the execution of it, then it is
a crime; because he might have been righted, (without any breach of the
peace,) upon complaint.

the degrees [[degree]] of crime are taken on divers scales, and measured, first, by
the malignity of the source, or cause: secondly, by the contagion of the
example: thirdly, by the mischiefe of the effect; and fourthly, by the
concurrence of times [[time]], places, and persons [[person]].




presumption of [[power]], aggravateth

the same [[fact]] done against the [[law]], if it proceed from presumption of
strength, riches [[rich]], or [[friends]] to resist those that are to execute the
law, is a greater crime, than if it proceed from [[hope]] of not being
discovered, or of escape by flight: for presumption of impunity by
force, is a root, from whence springeth, at all times [[time]], and upon all
temptations, a contempt of all lawes; whereas in the later case, the
apprehension of danger, that makes a [[man]] fly, renders him more obedient
for the future. a crime which we [[know]] to be so, is greater than the same
crime proceeding from a false perswasion that it is lawfull: for he that
committeth it against his own [[conscience]], presumeth on his [[force]], or
other [[power]], which encourages him to commit the same again: but he that
doth it by errour, after the errour shewn him, is conformable to the
law.




evill teachers, extenuate

hee, whose errour proceeds from the [[authority]] of a teacher, or an
interpreter of the [[law]] publiquely authorised, is not so faulty, as he
whose errour proceedeth from a peremptory pursute of his own principles [[principle]],
and reasoning: for what is taught by one that teacheth by publique
authority, the common-wealth teacheth, and hath a resemblance of [[law]],
till the same [[authority]] controuleth it; and in all crimes that contain
not in them a denyall of the soveraign [[power]], nor are against an evident
law, excuseth totally: whereas he that groundeth his actions, on his
private judgement, ought according to the rectitude, or errour thereof,
to stand, or fall.




examples of impunity, extenuate

the same [[fact]], if it have been constantly punished in other [[men]], as
a greater crime, than if there have been may precedent examples [[example]] of
impunity. for those examples [[example]], are so many hopes [[hope]] of impunity given by
the soveraign himselfe: and because he which furnishes a [[man]] with such
a [[hope]], and presumption of [[mercy]], as encourageth him to offend, hath his
part in the offence; he cannot reasonably charge the offender with the
whole.




praemeditation, aggravateth

a crime arising from a sudden passion, is not so [[great]], as when the same
ariseth from long meditation: for in the former case there is a place
for extenuation, in the [[common]] infirmity of humane [[nature]]: but he that
doth it with praemeditation, has used circumspection, and cast his eye,
on the [[law]], on the [[punishment]], and on the consequence thereof to humane
society; all which in committing the crime, hee hath contemned, and
postposed to his own appetite. but there is no suddennesse of passion
sufficient for a totall excuse: for all the [[time]] between the first
knowing of the [[law]], and the commission of the [[fact]], shall be taken for
a [[time]] of deliberation; because he ought by meditation of the [[law]], to
rectifie the irregularity of his [[passions]].

where the [[law]] is publiquely, and with assiduity, before all the people
read, and interpreted; a [[fact]] done against it, is a greater crime,
than where [[men]] are left without such instruction, to enquire of it with
difficulty, uncertainty, and interruption of their callings, and
be informed by private [[men]]: for in this case, part of the [[fault]] is
discharged upon [[common]] infirmity; but in the former there is apparent
negligence, which is not without some contempt of the soveraign [[power]].




tacite approbation of the soveraign, extenuates

those facts [[fact]] which the [[law]] expresly condemneth, but the law-maker by
other manifest signes of his will tacitly approveth, are lesse crimes,
than the same facts [[fact]], condemned both by the [[law]], and lawmaker. for
seeing the will of the law-maker is a [[law]], there appear in this case two
contradictory lawes; which would totally excuse, if [[men]] were bound to
take notice of the soveraigns approbation, by other arguments, than are
expressed by his command. but because there are punishments [[punishment]] consequent,
not onely to the transgression of his [[law]], but also to the observing
of it, he is in part a cause of the transgression, and therefore cannot
reasonably impute the whole crime to the delinquent. for [[example]], the
law condemneth duells; the [[punishment]] is made capitall: on the contrary
part, he that refuseth duell, is [[subject]] to contempt and scorne, without
remedy; and sometimes by the soveraign himselfe [[thought]] unworthy to
have any charge, or preferment in warre: if thereupon he accept duell,
considering all [[men]] lawfully endeavour to obtain the [[good]] opinion
of them that have the soveraign [[power]], he ought not in [[reason]] to be
rigorously punished; seeing part of the [[fault]] may be discharged on the
punisher; which i say, not as wishing [[liberty]] of private revenges,
or any other [[kind]] of disobedience; but a [[care]] in governours, not
to countenance any thing obliquely, which directly they forbid. the
examples of princes [[prince]], to those that see them, are, and ever have been,
more potent to govern their actions, than the lawes themselves. and
though it be our [[duty]] to do, not what they do, but what they say; yet
will that [[duty]] never be performed, till it please [[god]] to give [[men]] an
extraordinary, and supernaturall grace to [[follow]] that precept.




comparison of crimes from their effects

again, if we compare crimes by the mischiefe of their effects, first,
the same [[fact]], when it redounds to the dammage of many, is greater, than
when it redounds to the hurt of few. and therefore, when a [[fact]] hurteth,
not onely in the [[present]], but also, (by example) in the future, it is a
greater crime, than if it hurt onely in the [[present]]: for the former,
is a fertile crime, and multiplyes to the hurt of many; the later is
barren. to maintain doctrines contrary to the [[religion]] established in
the common-wealth, is a greater [[fault]], in an authorised preacher, than
in a private [[person]]: so also is it, to [[live]] prophanely, incontinently,
or do any irreligious act whatsoever. likewise in a professor of the
law, to maintain any point, on do any act, that tendeth to the weakning
of the soveraign [[power]], as a greater crime, than in another [[man]]: also in
a [[man]] that hath such [[reputation]] for wisedome, as that his counsells are
followed, or his actions imitated by many, his [[fact]] against the [[law]], is
a greater crime, than the same [[fact]] in another: for such [[men]] not onely
commit crime, but [[teach]] it for [[law]] to all other [[men]]. and generally all
crimes are the greater, by the scandall they give; that is to say, by
becoming stumbling-blocks to the [[weak]], that look not so much upon the
way they go in, as upon the [[light]] that other [[men]] carry before them.




laesae majestas

also facts [[fact]] of hostility against the [[present]] [[state]] of the common-wealth,
are greater crimes, than the same acts done to private [[men]]; for
the dammage extends it selfe to all: such are the betraying of the
strengths, or revealing of the secrets of the common-wealth to an [[enemy]];
also all attempts upon the representative of the common-wealth, be it a
monarch, or an assembly; and all endeavours by word, or deed to diminish
the [[authority]] of the same, either in the [[present]] [[time]], or in succession:
which crimes the latines [[understand]] by crimina laesae majestatis, and
consist in designe, or act, contrary to a fundamentall [[law]].




bribery and false testimony

likewise those crimes, which render judgements of no effect, are greater
crimes, than injuries done to one, or a few persons [[person]]; as to receive
mony to give false judgement, or testimony, is a greater crime, than
otherwise to [[deceive]] a [[man]] of the like, or a greater summe; because not
onely he has [[wrong]], that falls by such judgements; but all judgements
are rendered uselesse, and [[occasion]] ministred to [[force]], and private
revenges.




depeculation

also robbery, and depeculation of the publique treasure, or revenues [[revenue]],
is a greater crime, than the robbing, or defrauding of a private [[man]];
because to robbe the publique, is to robbe many at once.




counterfeiting authority

also the counterfeit usurpation of publique ministery, the
counterfeiting of publique seales, or publique coine, than
counterfeiting of a private mans [[man]] [[person]], or his seale; because the fraud
thereof, extendeth to the dammage of many.




crimes against private [[men]] compared

of facts [[fact]] against the [[law]], done to private [[men]], the greater crime, is
that, where the dammage in the [[common]] [[opinion]] of [[men]], is most sensible.
and therefore

to kill against the [[law]], is a greater crime, that any other injury, life
preserved.

and to kill with torment, greater, than simply to kill.

and mutilation of a limbe, greater, than the spoyling a [[man]] of his
goods.

and the spoyling a [[man]] of his goods [[good]], by terrour of [[death]], or wounds,
than by clandestine surreption.

and by clandestine surreption, than by [[consent]] fraudulently obtained.

and the violation of chastity by [[force]], greater, than by [[flattery]].

and of a woman [[married]], than of a woman not [[married]].

for all these things are commonly so valued; though some [[men]] are more,
and some lesse sensible of the same offence. but the [[law]] regardeth not
the particular, but the generall inclination of [[mankind]].

and therefore the offence [[men]] take, from contumely, in words, or
gesture, when they [[produce]] no other harme, than the [[present]] griefe of
him that is reproached, hath been neglected in the lawes of the greeks [[greek]],
romans, and other both antient, and moderne common-wealths; supposing
the true cause of such griefe to consist, not in the contumely, (which
takes no hold upon [[men]] conscious of their own vertue,) but in the
pusillanimity of him that is offended by it.

also a crime against a private [[man]], is much aggravated by the [[person]],
time, and place. for to kill ones parent, is a greater crime, than to
kill another: for the parent ought to have the [[honour]] of a soveraign,
(though he have surrendred his [[power]] to the civill [[law]],) because he had
it originally by [[nature]]. and to robbe a poore [[man]], is a greater crime,
than to robbe a [[rich]] [[man]]; because ’tis to the poore a more sensible
dammage.

and a crime committed in the [[time]], or place appointed for devotion, is
greater, than if committed at another [[time]] or place: for it proceeds
from a greater contempt of the [[law]].

many other cases of aggravation, and extenuation might be added: but by
these i have set down, it is obvious to every [[man]], to take the altitude
of any other crime proposed.




publique crimes what

lastly, because in almost all crimes there is an injury done, not onely
to some private [[man]], but also to the common-wealth; the same crime, when
the accusation is in the name of the common-wealth, is called publique
crime; and when in the name of a private [[man]], a private crime; and the
pleas according thereunto called publique, judicia publica, pleas of the
crown; or private pleas. as in an accusation of murder, if the accuser
be a private [[man]], the plea is a private plea; if the accuser be the
soveraign, the plea is a publique plea.



chapter xxviii. of punishments [[punishment]], and rewards




the definition of punishment

"a [[punishment]], is an evill inflicted by publique [[authority]], on him that
hath done, or omitted that which is judged by the same [[authority]] to be
a transgression of the [[law]]; to the end that the will of [[men]] may thereby
the [[better]] be disposed to [[obedience]]."




right to punish whence derived

before i inferre any thing from this definition, there is a [[question]] to
be answered, of much importance; which is, by what door the [[right]], or
authority of punishing in any case, came in. for by that which has
been said before, no [[man]] is supposed bound by covenant, not to resist
violence; and consequently it cannot be intended, that he gave any right
to another to lay [[violent]] hands upon his [[person]]. in the making of a
common-wealth, every [[man]] giveth away the [[right]] of defending another; but
not of defending himselfe. also he obligeth himselfe, to assist him that
hath the soveraignty, in the punishing of another; but of himselfe
not. but to covenant to assist the soveraign, in doing hurt to another,
unlesse he that so covenanteth have a [[right]] to doe it himselfe, is not
to give him a [[right]] to punish. it is manifest therefore that the right
which the common-wealth (that is, he, or they that represent it) hath to
punish, is not grounded on any concession, or gift of the subjects [[subject]].
but i have also shewed formerly, that before the institution of
common-wealth, every [[man]] had a [[right]] to every thing, and to do
whatsoever he [[thought]] necessary to his own preservation; subduing,
hurting, or killing any [[man]] in order thereunto. and this is the
foundation of that [[right]] of punishing, which is exercised in every
common-wealth. for the subjects [[subject]] did not give the soveraign that [[right]];
but onely in laying down theirs, strengthned him to use his own, as he
should [[think]] fit, for the preservation of them all: so that it was not
given, but left to him, and to him onely; and (excepting the limits set
him by naturall law) as entire, as in the condition of meer [[nature]], and
of warre of every one against his neighbour.




private injuries, and revenges no punishments

from the definition of [[punishment]], i inferre, first, that neither
private revenges, nor injuries of private [[men]], can properly be stiled
punishment; because they proceed not from publique [[authority]].




nor denyall of preferment

secondly, that to be neglected, and unpreferred by the publique
favour, is not a [[punishment]]; because no new evill is thereby on any man
inflicted; he is onely left in the estate he was in before.




nor [[pain]] inflicted without publique hearing

thirdly, that the evill inflicted by publique [[authority]], without
precedent publique condemnation, is not to be stiled by the name of
punishment; but of an hostile act; because the [[fact]] for which a man
is punished, ought first to be judged by publique [[authority]], to be a
transgression of the [[law]].




nor [[pain]] inflicted by usurped power

fourthly, that the evill inflicted by usurped [[power]], and judges
without [[authority]] from the soveraign, is not [[punishment]]; but an act of
hostility; because the acts of [[power]] usurped, have not for author, the
person condemned; and therefore are not acts of publique [[authority]].




nor [[pain]] inflicted without [[respect]] to the future good

fifthly, that all evill which is inflicted without intention, or
possibility of disposing the delinquent, or (by his example) other [[men]],
to obey the lawes, is not [[punishment]]; but an act of hostility; because
without such an end, no hurt done is contained under that name.




naturall evill consequences, no punishments

sixthly, whereas to [[certain]] actions, there be annexed by [[nature]], divers
hurtfull consequences; as when a [[man]] in assaulting another, is himselfe
slain, or wounded; or when he falleth into sicknesse by the doing of
some unlawfull act; such hurt, though in [[respect]] of [[god]], who is the
author of [[nature]], it may be said to be inflicted, and therefore a
punishment [[divine]]; yet it is not contaned in the name of [[punishment]] in
respect of [[men]], because it is not inflicted by the [[authority]] of [[man]].




hurt inflicted, if lesse than the benefit of transgressing, is not
punishment

seventhly, if the harm inflicted be lesse than the benefit, or
contentment that naturally followeth the crime committed, that harm is
not within the definition; and is rather the price, or redemption, than
the [[punishment]] of a crime: because it is of the [[nature]] of [[punishment]], to
have for end, the disposing of [[men]] to obey the [[law]]; which end (if it
be lesse that the benefit of the transgression) it attaineth not, but
worketh a contrary effect.




where the [[punishment]] is annexed to the [[law]], a greater hurt is not
punishment, but hostility

eighthly, if a [[punishment]] be determined and prescribed in the [[law]] it
selfe, and after the crime committed, there be a greater punishment
inflicted, the excesse is not [[punishment]], but an act of hostility. for
seeing the aym of [[punishment]] is not a [[revenge]], but terrour; and the
terrour of a [[great]] [[punishment]] unknown, is taken away by the declaration
of a lesse, the unexpected addition is no part of the [[punishment]].
but where there is no [[punishment]] at all determined by the [[law]], there
whatsoever is inflicted, hath the [[nature]] of [[punishment]]. for he that
goes about the violation of a [[law]], wherein no penalty is determined,
expecteth an indeterminate, that is to say, an arbitrary [[punishment]].




hurt inflicted for a [[fact]] done before the [[law]], no punishment

ninthly, harme inflicted for a [[fact]] done before there was a [[law]] that
forbad it, is not [[punishment]], but an act of hostility: for before the
law, there is no transgression of the [[law]]: but [[punishment]] supposeth a
fact judged, to have been a transgression of the [[law]]; therefore
harme inflicted before the [[law]] made, is not [[punishment]], but an act of
hostility.




the representative of the common-wealth unpunishable

tenthly, hurt inflicted on the representative of the common-wealth, is
not [[punishment]], but an act of hostility: because it is of the nature
of [[punishment]], to be inflicted by publique [[authority]], which is the
authority only of the representative it [[self]].




hurt to revolted subjects [[subject]] is done by [[right]] of [[war]], not by way of
punishment

lastly, harme inflicted upon one that is a declared [[enemy]], fals not
under the name of [[punishment]]: because seeing they were either never
subject to the [[law]], and therefore cannot transgresse it; or having been
subject to it, and professing to be no longer so, by consequence deny
they can transgresse it, all the harmes that can be done them, must be
taken as acts of hostility. but in declared hostility, all infliction of
evill is lawfull. from whence it followeth, that if a [[subject]] shall
by [[fact]], or word, wittingly, and deliberatly deny the [[authority]] of
the representative of the common-wealth, (whatsoever penalty hath
been formerly ordained for [[treason]],) he may lawfully be made to suffer
whatsoever the representative will: for in denying subjection, he denyes
such [[punishment]] as by the [[law]] hath been ordained; and therefore suffers
as an [[enemy]] of the common-wealth; that is, according to the will of
the representative. for the punishments [[punishment]] set down in the [[law]], are to
subjects, not to enemies [[enemy]]; such as are they, that having been by their
own act subjects [[subject]], deliberately revolting, deny the soveraign [[power]].

the first, and most generall distribution of punishments [[punishment]], is into
divine, and humane. of the former i shall have [[occasion]], to speak, in a
more convenient place hereafter.

humane, are those punishments [[punishment]] that be inflicted by the commandement
of [[man]]; and are either corporall, or pecuniary, or ignominy, or
imprisonment, or [[exile]], or mixt of these.




punishments corporall

corporall [[punishment]] is that, which is inflicted on the [[body]] directly,
and according to the intention of him that inflicteth it: such as are
stripes, or wounds, or deprivation of such pleasures [[pleasure]] of the [[body]], as
were before lawfully enjoyed.




capitall

and of these, some be capitall, some lesse than capitall. capitall, is
the infliction of [[death]]; and that either simply, or with torment. lesse
than capitall, are stripes, wounds, chains, and any other corporall
paine, not in its own [[nature]] mortall. for if upon the infliction of
a [[punishment]] [[death]] [[follow]] not in the intention of the inflicter, the
punishment is not be bee esteemed capitall, though the harme prove
mortall by an accident not to be foreseen; in which case [[death]] is not
inflicted, but hastened.

pecuniary [[punishment]], is that which consisteth not only in the
deprivation of a summe of mony, but also of lands [[land]], or any other goods
which are usually bought and sold for mony. and in case the [[law]], that
ordaineth such a [[punishment]], be made with design to gather mony, from
such as shall transgresse the same, it is not properly a [[punishment]],
but the price of priviledge, and exemption from the [[law]], which doth not
absolutely forbid the [[fact]], but only to those that are not able to pay
the mony: except where the [[law]] is naturall, or part of [[religion]]; for in
that case it is not an exemption from the [[law]], but a transgression of
it. as where a [[law]] exacteth a pecuniary mulct, of them that take the
name of [[god]] in vaine, the payment of the mulct, is not the price of a
dispensation to sweare, but the [[punishment]] of the transgression of a law
undispensable. in like manner if the [[law]] impose a summe of mony to be
payd, to him that has been injured; this is but a satisfaction for the
hurt done him; and extinguisheth the accusation of the party injured,
not the crime of the offender.




ignominy

ignominy, is the infliction of such evill, as is made dishonorable;
or the deprivation of such [[good]], as is made honourable by the
common-wealth. for there be some things honorable by [[nature]]; as the
effects of [[courage]], magnanimity, [[strength]], wisdome, and other abilities
of [[body]] and [[mind]]: others made honorable by the common-wealth; as badges,
titles, offices, or any other singular marke of the soveraigns favour.
the former, (though they may faile by [[nature]], or accident,) cannot be
taken away by a [[law]]; and therefore the losse of them is not [[punishment]].
but the later, may be taken away by the publique [[authority]] that made
them honorable, and are properly punishments [[punishment]]: such are degrading men
condemned, of their badges, titles, and offices; or declaring them
uncapable of the like in [[time]] to come.




imprisonment

imprisonment, is when a [[man]] is by publique [[authority]] deprived of
liberty; and may happen from two divers ends; whereof one is the safe
custody of a [[man]] accused; the other is the inflicting of paine on a man
condemned. the former is not [[punishment]]; because no [[man]] is supposed
to be punisht, before he be judicially heard, and declared guilty.
and therefore whatsoever hurt a [[man]] is made to suffer by bonds, or
restraint, before his cause be heard, over and above that which is
necessary to assure his custody, is against the [[law]] of [[nature]]. but the
later is [[punishment]], because evill, and inflicted by publique [[authority]],
for somewhat that has by the same [[authority]] been judged a transgression
of the [[law]]. under this word imprisonment, i comprehend all restraint of
motion, caused by an externall obstacle, be it a house, which is called
by the generall name of a prison; or an iland, as when [[men]] are said to
be confined to it; or a place where [[men]] are set to worke, as in old time
men have been condemned to quarries, and in these times [[time]] to gallies; or
be it a chaine, or any other such impediment.




exile

exile, (banishment) is when a [[man]] is for a crime, condemned to depart
out of the dominion of the common-wealth, or out of a certaine part
thereof; and during a prefixed [[time]], or for ever, not to return into it:
and seemeth not in its own [[nature]], without other circumstances, to be
a [[punishment]]; but rather an escape, or a publique commandement to
avoid [[punishment]] by flight. and cicero sayes, there was never any such
punishment ordained in the [[city]] of [[rome]]; but cals it a refuge of [[men]] in
danger. for if a [[man]] [[banished]], be neverthelesse permitted to enjoy
his goods [[good]], and the [[revenue]] of his lands [[land]], the meer [[change]] of ayr is no
punishment; nor does it tend to that benefit of the common-wealth, for
which all punishments [[punishment]] are ordained, (that is to say, to the forming of
mens wils to the observation of the [[law]];) but many times [[time]] to the dammage
of the common-wealth. for a [[banished]] [[man]], is a lawfull [[enemy]] of the
common-wealth that [[banished]] him; as being no more a member of the
same. but if he be withall deprived of his lands [[land]], or goods [[good]], then
the [[punishment]] lyeth not in the [[exile]], but is to be reckoned amongst
punishments pecuniary.




the [[punishment]] of [[innocent]] subjects [[subject]] is contrary to the [[law]] of nature

all punishments [[punishment]] of [[innocent]] subjects [[subject]], be they [[great]] or little, are
against the [[law]] of [[nature]]; for [[punishment]] is only of transgression of
the [[law]], and therefore there can be no [[punishment]] of the [[innocent]]. it
is therefore a violation, first, of that [[law]] of [[nature]], which forbiddeth
all [[men]], in their revenges, to look at any thing but some future [[good]]:
for there can arrive no [[good]] to the common-wealth, by punishing the
innocent. secondly, of that, which forbiddeth ingratitude: for seeing
all soveraign [[power]], is originally given by the [[consent]] of every one of
the subjects [[subject]], to the end they should as long as they are [[obedient]], be
protected thereby; the [[punishment]] of the [[innocent]], is a rendring of
evill for [[good]]. and thirdly, of the [[law]] that commandeth equity; that
is to say, an equall distribution of [[justice]]; which in punishing the
innocent is not observed.




but the harme done to innocents in [[war]], not so

but the infliction of what evill soever, on an [[innocent]] [[man]], that is not
a [[subject]], if it be for the benefit of the common-wealth, and without
violation of any former covenant, is no breach of the [[law]] of [[nature]].
for all [[men]] that are not subjects [[subject]], are either enemies [[enemy]], or else they have
ceased from being so, by some precedent covenants. but against enemies [[enemy]],
whom the common-wealth judgeth capable to do them hurt, it is lawfull by
the originall [[right]] of [[nature]] to make warre; wherein the [[sword]] judgeth
not, nor doth the victor make distinction of nocent and [[innocent]], as to
the [[time]] [[past]]; nor has other [[respect]] of [[mercy]], than as it conduceth to
the [[good]] of his own [[people]]. and upon this ground it is, that also
in subjects [[subject]], who deliberatly deny the [[authority]] of the common-wealth
established, the vengeance is lawfully extended, not onely to the
fathers, but also to the third and fourth [[generation]] not yet in being,
and consequently [[innocent]] of the [[fact]], for which they are afflicted:
because the [[nature]] of this offence, consisteth in the renouncing of
subjection; which is a relapse into the condition of warre, commonly
called rebellion; and they that so offend, suffer not as subjects [[subject]], but
as enemies [[enemy]]. for rebellion, is but warre renewed.




reward, is either salary, or grace

reward, is either of gift, or by contract. when by contract, it is
called salary, and wages; which is benefit due for service performed, or
promised. when of gift, it is benefit proceeding from the grace of them
that bestow it, to encourage, or enable [[men]] to do them service. and
therefore when the soveraign of a common-wealth appointeth a salary
to any publique office, he that receiveth it, is bound in justice
to performe his office; otherwise, he is bound onely in [[honour]], to
acknowledgement, and an endeavour of requitall. for though [[men]] have no
lawfull remedy, when they be commanded to quit their private businesse,
to serve the publique, without [[reward]], or salary; yet they are not
bound thereto, by the [[law]] of [[nature]], nor by the institution of the
common-wealth, unlesse the service cannot otherwise be done; because it
is supposed the soveraign may make use of all their means, insomuch as
the most [[common]] souldier, may demand the wages of his warrefare, as a
debt.




benefits bestowed for [[fear]], are not rewards

the benefits which a soveraign bestoweth on a [[subject]], for [[fear]] of some
power, and ability he hath to do hurt to the common-wealth, are not
properly rewards [[reward]]; for they are not salaryes; because there is in this
case no contract supposed, every [[man]] being obliged already not to do the
common-wealth disservice: nor are they graces; because they be extorted
by feare, which ought not to be incident to the soveraign [[power]]: but
are rather sacrifices [[sacrifice]], which the soveraign (considered in his naturall
person, and not in the [[person]] of the common-wealth) makes, for the
appeasing the discontent of him he thinks [[think]] more potent than himselfe; and
encourage not to [[obedience]], but on the contrary, to the continuance, and
increasing of further extortion.




salaries [[certain]] and casuall

and whereas some salaries are [[certain]], and proceed from the publique
treasure; and others uncertain, and casuall, proceeding from the
execution of the office for which the salary is ordained; the later
is in some cases hurtfull to the common-wealth; as in the case of
judicature. for where the benefit of the judges [[judge]], and ministers of a
court of [[justice]], ariseth for the multitude of causes that are brought
to their cognisance, there must needs [[follow]] two inconveniences: one,
is the nourishing of sutes; for the more sutes, the greater benefit: and
another that depends on that, which is contention about jurisdiction;
each court drawing to it selfe, as many causes as it can. but in
offices of execution there are not those inconveniences; because their
employment cannot be encreased by any endeavour of their own. and thus
much shall suffice for the [[nature]] of [[punishment]], and [[reward]]; which are,
as it were, the nerves and tendons, that move the limbes and joynts of a
common-wealth.

hitherto i have set forth the [[nature]] of [[man]], (whose [[pride]] and other
passions have compelled him to submit himselfe to [[government]];) together
with the [[great]] [[power]] of his governour, whom i compared to leviathan,
taking that comparison out of the two [[last]] verses of the one and
fortieth of [[job]]; where [[god]] having set forth the [[great]] [[power]] of
leviathan, called him [[king]] of the proud. "there is nothing," saith he,
"on [[earth]], to be compared with him. he is made so as not be afraid. hee
seeth every high thing below him; and is [[king]] of all the [[children]] of
pride." but because he is mortall, and [[subject]] to decay, as all other
earthly creatures are; and because there is that in [[heaven]], (though not
on earth) that he should stand in [[fear]] of, and whose lawes he ought to
obey; i shall in the next following chapters [[chapter]] speak of his diseases, and
the causes of his [[mortality]]; and of what lawes of [[nature]] he is bound to
obey.



chapter xxix. of those things that weaken, or tend to the dissolution of
a common-wealth


dissolution of common-wealths proceedeth from imperfect institution

though nothing can be immortall, which mortals make; yet, if [[men]] had the
use of [[reason]] they pretend to, their common-wealths might be secured, at
least, from perishing by internall diseases. for by the [[nature]] of their
institution, they are designed to [[live]], as long as man-kind, or as
the lawes of [[nature]], or as [[justice]] it selfe, which gives them [[life]].
therefore when they come to be dissolved, not by externall [[violence]], but
intestine disorder, the [[fault]] is not in [[men]], as they are the matter; but
as they are the makers, and orderers of them. for [[men]], as they become
at [[last]] weary of irregular justling, and hewing one another, and desire
with all their hearts [[heart]], to conforme themselves into one firme and lasting
edifice; so for want, both of the art [[arts]] of making fit laws [[law]], to square
their actions by, and also of [[humility]], and patience, to suffer the rude
and combersome points of their [[present]] greatnesse to be taken off, they
cannot without the [[help]] of a very able architect, be compiled, into any
other than a crasie building, such as hardly lasting out their own [[time]],
must assuredly fall upon the heads of their [[posterity]].

amongst the infirmities therefore of a common-wealth, i will reckon in
the first place, those that arise from an imperfect institution,
and resemble the diseases of a naturall [[body]], which proceed from a
defectuous procreation.




want of absolute power

of which, this is one, "that a [[man]] to obtain a kingdome, is sometimes
content with lesse [[power]], than to the [[peace]], and defence of the
common-wealth is necessarily required." from whence it commeth to passe,
that when the exercise of the [[power]] layd by, is for the publique safety
to be resumed, it hath the resemblance of as [[unjust]] act; which disposeth
great numbers of [[men]] (when [[occasion]] is presented) to rebell; in the
same manner as the bodies [[body]] of [[children]], gotten by diseased parents, are
subject either to untimely [[death]], or to purge the ill quality, derived
from their vicious conception, by breaking out into biles and scabbs.
and when kings [[king]] deny themselves some such necessary [[power]], it is not
alwayes (though sometimes) out of ignorance of what is necessary to the
office they undertake; but many times [[time]] out of a [[hope]] to recover the same
again at their [[pleasure]]: wherein they [[reason]] not well; because such as
will hold them to their promises, shall be maintained against them by
forraign common-wealths; who in order to the [[good]] of their own subjects
let slip few occasions [[occasion]] to weaken the estate of their neighbours. so was
thomas beckett archbishop of canterbury, supported against henry
the second, by the [[pope]]; the subjection of ecclesiastiques to the
common-wealth, having been dispensed with by william the conqueror at
his reception, when he took an oath, not to infringe the [[liberty]] of the
church. and so were the barons, whose [[power]] was by william rufus (to
have their [[help]] in transferring the succession from his elder [[brother]],
to himselfe,) encreased to a [[degree]], inconsistent with the soveraign
power, maintained in their rebellion against [[king]] john, by the french.
nor does this happen in [[monarchy]] onely. for whereas the stile of the
antient roman common-wealth, was, the senate, and [[people]] of [[rome]];
neither senate, nor [[people]] pretended to the whole [[power]]; which first
caused the seditions, of tiberius gracchus, caius gracchus, lucius
saturnius, and others; and afterwards the warres between the senate and
the [[people]], under marius and sylla; and again under pompey and caesar,
to the extinction of their democraty, and the setting up of [[monarchy]].

the [[people]] of [[athens]] bound themselves but from one onely action; which
was, that no [[man]] on [[pain]] of [[death]] should propound the renewing of the
warre for the island of salamis; and yet thereby, if solon had not
caused to be given out he was mad, and afterwards in gesture and habit
of a mad-man, and in verse, propounded it to the [[people]] that flocked
about him, they had had an [[enemy]] perpetually in readinesse, even at the
gates of their citie; such dammage, or shifts, are all common-wealths
forced to, that have their [[power]] never so little limited.




private judgement of [[good]] and evill

in the second place, i observe the diseases of a common-wealth, that
proceed from the poyson of seditious doctrines; whereof one is, "that
every private [[man]] is [[judge]] of [[good]] and evill actions." this is true in
the condition of meer [[nature]], where there are no civill lawes; and also
under civill [[government]], in such cases as are not determined by the
law. but otherwise, it is manifest, that the measure of [[good]] and evill
actions, is the civill [[law]]; and the [[judge]] the legislator, who is alwayes
representative of the common-wealth. from this false doctrine, [[men]] are
disposed to debate with themselves, and dispute the commands of the
common-wealth; and afterwards to obey, or disobey them, as in their
private judgements they shall [[think]] fit. whereby the common-wealth is
distracted and weakened.




erroneous conscience

another doctrine repugnant to civill [[society]], is, that "whatsoever a
man does against his [[conscience]], is sinne;" and it dependeth on the
presumption of making himself [[judge]] of [[good]] and evill. for a mans
conscience, and his judgement is the same thing; and as the judgement,
so also the [[conscience]] may be erroneous. therefore, though he that is
subject to no civill [[law]], sinneth in all he does against his [[conscience]],
because he has no other [[rule]] to [[follow]] but his own [[reason]]; yet it is
not so with him that lives [[life]] in a common-wealth; because the [[law]] is the
publique [[conscience]], by which he hath already undertaken to be guided.
otherwise in such [[diversity]], as there is of private consciences, which
are but private opinions [[opinion]], the common-wealth must needs be distracted,
and no [[man]] dare to obey the soveraign [[power]], farther than it shall seem
good in his own [[eyes]].




pretence of inspiration

it hath been also commonly taught, "that [[faith]] and [[sanctity]], are not to
be attained by study and [[reason]], but by supernaturall inspiration, or
infusion," which granted, i see not why any [[man]] should render a reason
of his [[faith]]; or why every [[christian]] should not be also a [[prophet]]; or
why any [[man]] should take the [[law]] of his [[country]], rather than his own
inspiration, for the [[rule]] of his action. and thus wee fall again into
the [[fault]] of taking upon us to [[judge]] of [[good]] and evill; or to make
judges of it, such private [[men]] as pretend to be supernaturally inspired,
to the dissolution of all civill [[government]]. [[faith]] comes by hearing,
and hearing by those accidents, which guide us into the presence of them
that speak to us; which accidents are all contrived by [[god]] almighty; and
yet are not supernaturall, but onely, for the [[great]] number of them that
concurre to every effect, unobservable. [[faith]], and [[sanctity]], are indeed
not very frequent; but yet they are not [[miracles]], but brought to passe
by [[education]], discipline, correction, and other naturall wayes, by which
god worketh them in his elect, as such [[time]] as he thinketh fit. and
these three opinions [[opinion]], pernicious to [[peace]] and [[government]], have in this
part of the [[world]], proceeded chiefly from the tongues, and pens of
unlearned divines; who joyning the words of holy [[scripture]] together,
otherwise than is agreeable to [[reason]], do what they can, to make men
think, that [[sanctity]] and naturall [[reason]], cannot stand together.




subjecting the soveraign [[power]] to civill lawes

a fourth [[opinion]], repugnant to the [[nature]] of a common-wealth, is this,
"that he that hath the soveraign [[power]], is [[subject]] to the civill lawes."
it is true, that soveraigns are all subjects [[subject]] to the lawes of [[nature]];
because such lawes be [[divine]], and cannot by any [[man]], or common-wealth
be abrogated. but to those lawes which the soveraign himselfe, that is,
which the common-wealth maketh, he is not [[subject]]. for to be [[subject]] to
lawes, is to be [[subject]] to the common-wealth, that is to the soveraign
representative, that is to himselfe; which is not subjection, but
freedome from the lawes. which errour, because it setteth the lawes
above the soveraign, setteth also a [[judge]] above him, and a [[power]] to
punish him; which is to make a new soveraign; and again for the same
reason a third, to punish the second; and so continually without end, to
the confusion, and dissolution of the common-wealth.




attributing of absolute propriety to the subjects

a fifth doctrine, that tendeth to the dissolution of a common-wealth,
is, "that every private [[man]] has an absolute propriety in his goods [[good]];
such, as excludeth the [[right]] of the soveraign." every [[man]] has indeed a
propriety that excludes the [[right]] of every other [[subject]]: and he has it
onely from the soveraign [[power]]; without the protection whereof, every
other [[man]] should have equall [[right]] to the same. but if the [[right]] of the
soveraign also be excluded, he cannot performe the office they have put
him into; which is, to defend them both from forraign enemies [[enemy]], and
from the injuries of one another; and consequently there is no longer a
common-wealth.

and if the propriety of subjects [[subject]], exclude not the [[right]] of the
soveraign representative to their goods [[good]]; much lesse to their offices
of judicature, or execution, in which they represent the soveraign
himselfe.




dividing of the soveraign power

there is a sixth doctrine, plainly, and directly against the essence
of a common-wealth; and ’tis this, "that the soveraign [[power]] may be
divided." for what is it to divide the [[power]] of a common-wealth, but
to dissolve it; for powers [[power]] divided mutually [[destroy]] each other. and for
these doctrines, [[men]] are chiefly beholding to some of those, that making
profession of the lawes, endeavour to make them depend upon their own
learning, and not upon the legislative [[power]].




imitation of neighbour nations

and as false doctrine, so also often-times the [[example]] of different
government in a neighbouring nation, disposeth [[men]] to alteration of
the forme already setled. so the [[people]] of the jewes were stirred up to
reject [[god]], and to call upon the [[prophet]] samuel, for a [[king]] after
the manner of the nations; so also the lesser cities [[city]] of greece, were
continually disturbed, with seditions of the aristocraticall, and
democraticall factions; one part of almost every common-wealth, desiring
to imitate the lacedaemonians; the other, the athenians. and i doubt
not, but many [[men]], have been contented to see the late troubles in
england, out of an imitation of the low countries [[country]]; supposing there
needed no more to grow [[rich]], than to [[change]], as they had done, the forme
of their [[government]]. for the [[constitution]] of mans [[man]] [[nature]], is of it selfe
subject to [[desire]] novelty: when therefore they are provoked to the same,
by the neighbourhood also of those that have been enriched by it, it is
almost impossible for them, not to be content with those that solicite
them to [[change]]; and [[love]] the first beginnings, though they be grieved
with the continuance of disorder; like hot blouds, that having gotten
the itch, tear themselves with their own nayles, till they can endure
the smart no longer.




imitation of the greeks [[greek]], and romans

and as to rebellion in particular against [[monarchy]]; one of the most
frequent causes of it, is the reading of the books [[book]] of policy, and
histories of the antient greeks [[greek]], and romans; from which, [[young]] [[men]],
and all others that are unprovided of the antidote of solid [[reason]],
receiving a [[strong]], and delightfull impression, of the [[great]] exploits
of warre, atchieved by the conductors of their armies [[army]], receive withall
a pleasing [[idea]], of all they have done besides; and imagine their great
prosperity, not to have proceeded from the aemulation of particular [[men]],
but from the vertue of their popular form of [[government]]: not considering
the frequent seditions, and civill warres, produced by the imperfection
of their policy. from the reading, i say, of such books [[book]], [[men]] have
undertaken to kill their kings [[king]], because the [[greek]] and latine writers,
in their books [[book]], and discourses of policy, make it lawfull, and laudable,
for any [[man]] so to do; provided before he do it, he call him [[tyrant]]. for
they say not regicide, that is, killing of a [[king]], but tyrannicide, that
is, killing of a [[tyrant]] is lawfull. from the same books [[book]], they that live
under a monarch conceive an [[opinion]], that the subjects [[subject]] in a popular
common-wealth enjoy [[liberty]]; but that in a [[monarchy]] they are all slaves [[slave]].
i say, they that [[live]] under a [[monarchy]] conceive such an [[opinion]]; not
they that [[live]] under a popular [[government]]; for they find no such matter.
in summe, i cannot imagine, how anything can be more prejudiciall to a
monarchy, than the allowing of such books [[book]] to be publikely [[read]], without
present applying such correctives of discreet masters, as are fit to
take away their venime; which venime i will not [[doubt]] to compare to
the biting of a mad dogge, which is a disease the physicians call
hydrophobia, or [[fear]] of water. for as he that is so bitten, has a
continuall torment of thirst, and yet abhorreth water; and is in such
an estate, as if the poyson endeavoured to convert him into a dogge:
so when a [[monarchy]] is once bitten to the quick, by those democraticall
writers, that continually snarle at that estate; it wanteth nothing
more than a [[strong]] monarch, which neverthelesse out of a certain
tyrannophobia, or feare of being strongly governed, when they have him,
they abhorre.

as here have been doctors, that hold there be three soules in a [[man]];
so there be also that [[think]] there may be more soules, (that is, more
soveraigns,) than one, in a common-wealth; and set up a supremacy
against the soveraignty; canons against lawes; and a ghostly authority
against the civill; working on mens [[men]] minds [[mind]], with words and distinctions,
that of themselves signifie nothing, but bewray (by their obscurity)
that there walketh (as some [[think]] invisibly) another kingdome, as it
were a kingdome of fayries, in the dark. now seeing it is manifest, that
the civill [[power]], and the [[power]] of the common-wealth is the same
thing; and that [[supremacy]], and the [[power]] of making canons, and granting
faculties, implyeth a common-wealth; it followeth, that where one is
soveraign, another supreme; where one can make lawes, and another
make canons; there must needs be two common-wealths, of one & the same
subjects; which is a kingdome divided in it selfe, and cannot stand. for
notwithstanding the insignificant distinction of temporall, and ghostly,
they are still two kingdomes, and every [[subject]] is [[subject]] to two
masters. for seeing the ghostly [[power]] challengeth the [[right]] to declare
what is sinne it challengeth by consequence to declare what is [[law]],
(sinne being nothing but the transgression of the [[law]];) and again, the
civill [[power]] challenging to declare what is [[law]], every [[subject]] must
obey two masters, who bothe will have their commands be observed as [[law]];
which is impossible. or, if it be but one kingdome, either the civill,
which is the [[power]] of the common-wealth, must be subordinate to the
ghostly; or the ghostly must be subordinate to the temporall and then
there is no [[supremacy]] but the temporall. when therefore these two powers
oppose one another, the common-wealth cannot but be in [[great]] danger
of civill warre, and dissolution. for the civill [[authority]] being more
visible, and standing in the cleerer [[light]] of naturall [[reason]] cannot
choose but draw to it in all times [[time]] a very considerable part of the
people: and the spirituall, though it stand in the darknesse of schoole
distinctions, and hard words; yet because the [[fear]] of darknesse, and
ghosts, is greater than other fears [[fear]], cannot want a party sufficient to
trouble, and sometimes to [[destroy]] a common-wealth. and this is a disease
which not unfitly may be compared to the epilepsie, or falling-sicknesse
(which the jewes took to be one [[kind]] of possession by spirits) in the
body naturall. for as in this disease, there is an unnaturall spirit,
or wind in the head that obstructeth the roots of the nerves, and moving
them violently, taketh away the motion which naturally they should have
from the [[power]] of the soule in the brain, and thereby causeth [[violent]],
and irregular motions (which [[men]] call convulsions) in the parts;
insomuch as he that is seized therewith, falleth down sometimes into the
water, and sometimes into the [[fire]], as a [[man]] deprived of his senses;
so also in the [[body]] politique, when the spirituall [[power]], moveth the
members of a common-wealth, by the terrour of punishments [[punishment]], and [[hope]] of
rewards (which are the nerves of it,) otherwise than by the civill power
(which is the soule of the common-wealth) they ought to be moved; and by
strange, and hard words suffocates the [[people]], and either overwhelm
the common-wealth with oppression, or cast it into the [[fire]] of a civill
warre.




mixt government

sometimes also in the meerly civill [[government]], there be more than
one soule: as when the [[power]] of levying mony, (which is the nutritive
faculty,) has depended on a generall assembly; the [[power]] of conduct and
command, (which is the motive faculty,) on one [[man]]; and the [[power]] of
making lawes, (which is the rationall faculty,) on the accidentall
consent, not onely of those two, but also of a third; this endangereth
the common-wealth, somtimes for want of [[consent]] to [[good]] lawes; but most
often for want of such nourishment, as is necessary to [[life]], and motion.
for although few perceive, that such [[government]], is not [[government]],
but division of the common-wealth into three factions, and call it
mixt [[monarchy]]; yet the [[truth]] is, that it is not one independent
common-wealth, but three independent factions; nor one representative
person, but three. in the kingdome of [[god]], there may be three persons
independent, without breach of unity in [[god]] that reigneth; but where men
reigne, that be [[subject]] to [[diversity]] of opinions [[opinion]], it cannot be so. and
therefore if the [[king]] bear the [[person]] of the [[people]], and the generall
assembly bear also the [[person]] of the [[people]], and another assembly bear
the [[person]] of a part of the [[people]], they are not one [[person]], nor one
soveraign, but three persons [[person]], and three soveraigns.

to what disease in the naturall [[body]] of [[man]], i may exactly compare this
irregularity of a common-wealth, i [[know]] not. but i have seen a [[man]], that
had another [[man]] growing out of his side, with an head, armes, breast,
and stomach, of his own: if he had had another [[man]] growing out of his
other side, the comparison might then have been exact.




want of mony

hitherto i have named such diseases of a common-wealth, as are of the
greatest, and most [[present]] danger. there be other, not so [[great]]; which
neverthelesse are not unfit to be observed. as first, the difficulty of
raising mony, for the necessary uses of the common-wealth; especially
in the approach of warre. this difficulty ariseth from the [[opinion]], that
every [[subject]] hath of a propriety in his lands [[land]] and goods [[good]], exclusive of
the soveraigns [[right]] to the use of the same. from whence it commeth to
passe, that the soveraign [[power]], which foreseeth the necessities and
dangers of the common-wealth, (finding the passage of mony to the
publique treasure obstructed, by the tenacity of the [[people]],) whereas
it ought to extend it selfe, to encounter, and prevent such dangers in
their beginnings, contracteth it selfe as long as it can, and when it
cannot longer, struggles with the [[people]] by strategems of [[law]], to obtain
little summes, which not sufficing, he is fain at [[last]] violently to
open the way for [[present]] supply, or perish; and being put often to these
extremities, at [[last]] reduceth the [[people]] to their due temper; or else
the common-wealth must perish. insomuch as we may compare this distemper
very aptly to an ague; wherein, the fleshy parts being congealed, or
by venomous matter obstructed; the veins which by their naturall course
empty themselves into the [[heart]], are not (as they ought to be) supplyed
from the arteries, whereby there succeedeth at first a cold contraction,
and trembling of the limbes; and afterwards a hot, and [[strong]] endeavour
of the [[heart]], to [[force]] a passage for the bloud; and before it can do
that, contenteth it selfe with the small refreshments of such things as
coole of a [[time]], till (if [[nature]] be [[strong]] enough) it break at last
the contumacy of the parts obstructed, and dissipateth the venome into
sweat; or (if [[nature]] be too weak) the patient dyeth.




monopolies and abuses [[abuse]] of publicans

again, there is sometimes in a common-wealth, a disease, which
resembleth the pleurisie; and that is, when the treasure of the
common-wealth, flowing out of its due course, is gathered together in
too much abundance, in one, or a few private [[men]], by monopolies, or by
farmes of the publique revenues [[revenue]]; in the same manner as the [[blood]] in a
pleurisie, getting into the membrane of the breast, breedeth there an
inflammation, accompanied with a fever, and painfull stitches.




popular men

also, the popularity of a potent [[subject]], (unlesse the common-wealth
have very [[good]] caution of his fidelity,) is a dangerous disease; because
the [[people]] (which should receive their motion from the [[authority]] of the
soveraign,) by the [[flattery]], and by the [[reputation]] of an ambitious [[man]],
are drawn away from their [[obedience]] to the lawes, to [[follow]] a [[man]], of
whose vertues, and designes they have no [[knowledge]]. and this is commonly
of more danger in a popular [[government]], than in a [[monarchy]]; as it may
easily be made [[believe]], they are the [[people]]. by this means it was, that
julius caesar, who was set up by the [[people]] against the senate, having
won to himselfe the affections of his [[army]], made himselfe master, both
of senate and [[people]]. and this proceeding of popular, and ambitious [[men]],
is plain rebellion; and may be resembled to the effects of witchcraft.




excessive greatnesse of a town, multitude of corporations

another infirmity of a common-wealth, is the immoderate greatnesse of a
town, when it is able to furnish out of its own circuit, the number, and
expence of a [[great]] [[army]]: as also the [[great]] number of corporations; which
are as it were many lesser common-wealths in the bowels of a greater,
like wormes in the entrayles of a naturall [[man]].




liberty of disputing against soveraign power

to which may be added, the [[liberty]] of disputing against absolute [[power]],
by pretenders to politicall prudence; which though bred for the most
part in the lees of the [[people]]; yet animated by false doctrines, are
perpetually medling with the fundamentall lawes, to the molestation
of the common-wealth; like the little wormes, which physicians call
ascarides.

we may further adde, the insatiable appetite, or bulimia, of enlarging
dominion; with the incurable wounds thereby many times [[time]] received from
the [[enemy]]; and the wens, of ununited conquests, which are many times [[time]] a
burthen, and with lesse danger lost, than kept; as also the lethargy of
ease, and consumption of riot and [[vain]] expence.




dissolution of the common-wealth

lastly, when in a warre (forraign, or intestine,) the enemies [[enemy]] got a
final [[victory]]; so as (the forces [[force]] of the common-wealth keeping the field
no longer) there is no farther protection of subjects [[subject]] in their loyalty;
then is the common-wealth dissolved, and every [[man]] at [[liberty]] to protect
himselfe by such courses as his own discretion shall suggest unto him.
for the soveraign, is the publique soule, giving [[life]] and motion to the
common-wealth; which expiring, the members are governed by it no more,
than the carcasse of a [[man]], by his departed (though immortal) soule. for
though the [[right]] of a soveraign monarch cannot be extinguished by the
act of another; yet the obligation of the members may. for he that
wants protection, may seek it anywhere; and when he hath it, is obliged
(without fraudulent pretence of having submitted himselfe out of [[fear]],)
to [[protect]] his protection as long as he is able. but when the [[power]] of
an assembly is once suppressed, the [[right]] of the same perisheth utterly;
because the assembly it selfe is extinct; and consequently, there is no
possibility for the soveraignty to re-enter.



chapter xxx. of the office of the soveraign representative




the procuration of the [[good]] of the people

the office of the soveraign, (be it a monarch, or an assembly,)
consisteth in the end, for which he was trusted with the soveraign
power, namely the procuration of the safety of the [[people]]; to which he
is obliged by the [[law]] of [[nature]], and to render an account thereof to
god, the author of that [[law]], and to none but him. but by safety here, is
not meant a bare preservation, but also all other contentments of [[life]],
which every [[man]] by lawfull industry, without danger, or hurt to the
common-wealth, shall acquire to himselfe.




by instruction & lawes

and this is intended should be done, not by [[care]] applyed to
individualls, further than their protection from injuries, when they
shall [[complain]]; but by a generall providence, contained in publique
instruction, both of doctrine, and [[example]]; and in the making, and
executing of [[good]] lawes, to which individuall persons [[person]] may apply their
own cases.




against the [[duty]] of a soveraign to relinquish any essentiall [[right]] of
soveraignty or not to see the [[people]] taught the grounds of them

and because, if the essentiall rights [[right]] of soveraignty (specified before
in the eighteenth chapter) be taken away, the common-wealth is thereby
dissolved, and every [[man]] returneth into the condition, and calamity of a
warre with every other [[man]], (which is the [[greatest]] evill that can happen
in this [[life]];) it is the office of the soveraign, to maintain those
rights entire; and consequently against his [[duty]], first, to transferre
to another, or to lay from himselfe any of them. for he that deserteth
the means, deserteth the ends; and he deserteth the means, that being
the soveraign, acknowledgeth himselfe [[subject]] to the civill lawes; and
renounceth the [[power]] of supreme judicature; or of making warre, or
peace by his own [[authority]]; or of judging of the necessities of the
common-wealth; or of levying mony, and souldiers, when, and as much as
in his own [[conscience]] he shall [[judge]] necessary; or of making officers,
and ministers both of warre, and [[peace]]; or of appointing teachers, and
examining what doctrines are conformable, or contrary to the defence,
peace, and [[good]] of the [[people]]. secondly, it is against his [[duty]], to let
the [[people]] be ignorant, or mis-in-formed of the grounds, and reasons
of those his essentiall rights [[right]]; because thereby [[men]] are easie to be
seduced, and drawn to resist him, when the common-wealth shall require
their use and exercise.

and the grounds of these rights [[right]], have the rather need to be diligently,
and truly taught; because they cannot be maintained by any civill [[law]],
or terrour of legal [[punishment]]. for a civill [[law]], that shall forbid
rebellion, (and such is all [[resistance]] to the essentiall rights [[right]] of
soveraignty,) is not (as a civill law) any obligation, but by vertue
onely of the [[law]] of [[nature]], that forbiddeth the violation of [[faith]];
which naturall obligation if [[men]] [[know]] not, they cannot [[know]] the [[right]] of
any [[law]] the soveraign maketh. and for the [[punishment]], they take it
but for an act of hostility; which when they [[think]] they have strength
enough, they will endeavour by acts of hostility, to avoyd.




objection of those that say there are no principles [[principle]] of [[reason]] for
absolute soveraignty

as i have heard some say, that [[justice]] is but a word, without substance;
and that whatsoever a [[man]] can by [[force]], or art [[arts]], acquire to himselfe,
(not onely in the condition of warre, but also in a common-wealth,) is
his own, which i have already shewed to be false: so there be also
that maintain, that there are no grounds, nor principles [[principle]] of [[reason]], to
sustain those essentiall rights [[right]], which make soveraignty absolute. for
if there were, they would have been found out in some place, or other;
whereas we see, there has not hitherto been any common-wealth, where
those rights [[right]] have been acknowledged, or challenged. wherein they argue
as ill, as if the savage [[people]] of [[america]], should deny there were any
grounds, or principles [[principle]] of [[reason]], so to build a house, as to [[last]] as
long as the materials, because they never yet saw any so well built.
time, and industry, [[produce]] every day new [[knowledge]]. and as the art
of well building, is derived from principles [[principle]] of [[reason]], observed by
industrious [[men]], that had long [[studied]] the [[nature]] of materials, and
the divers effects of figure, and proportion, long after mankind
began (though poorly) to build: so, long [[time]] after [[men]] have begun to
constitute common-wealths, imperfect, and apt to relapse into disorder,
there may, principles [[principle]] of [[reason]] be found out, by industrious meditation,
to make use of them, or be neglected by them, or not, concerneth my
particular interest, at this day, very little. but supposing that
these of mine are not such principles [[principle]] of [[reason]]; yet i am sure they are
principles from [[authority]] of [[scripture]]; as i shall make it appear, when
i shall come to speak of the kingdome of [[god]], (administred by [[moses]],)
over the jewes, his peculiar [[people]] by covenant.




objection from the incapacity of the vulgar

but they say again, that though the principles [[principle]] be [[right]], yet common
people are not of capacity enough to be made to [[understand]] them. i
should be glad, that the [[rich]], and potent subjects [[subject]] of a kingdome, or
those that are accounted the most learned, were no lesse incapable than
they. but all [[men]] [[know]], that the obstructions to this [[kind]] of doctrine,
proceed not so much from the difficulty of the matter, as from the
interest of them that are to learn. potent [[men]], digest hardly any thing
that setteth up a [[power]] to bridle their affections; and learned [[men]],
any thing that discovereth their errours, and thereby lesseneth their
authority: whereas the common-peoples minds [[mind]], unlesse they be tainted
with dependance on the potent, or scribbled over with the opinions
of their doctors, are like clean paper, fit to receive whatsoever by
publique [[authority]] shall be imprinted in them. shall whole nations be
brought to acquiesce in the [[great]] mysteries of [[christian]] [[religion]], which
are above [[reason]]; and millions of [[men]] be made [[believe]], that the same
body may be in innumerable places, at one and the same [[time]], which
is against [[reason]]; and shall not [[men]] be able, by their teaching, and
preaching, protected by the [[law]], to make that received, which is so
consonant to [[reason]], that any unprejudicated [[man]], needs no more to learn
it, than to hear it? i conclude therefore, that in the instruction
of the [[people]] in the essentiall rights [[right]] (which are the naturall, and
fundamentall lawes) of soveraignty, there is no difficulty, (whilest a
soveraign has his [[power]] entire,) but what proceeds from his own [[fault]],
or the [[fault]] of those whom he trusteth in the administration of the
common-wealth; and consequently, it is his [[duty]], to cause them so to be
instructed; and not onely his [[duty]], but his benefit also, and security,
against the danger that may arrive to himselfe in his naturall [[person]],
from rebellion.




subjects are to be taught, not to affect [[change]] of government

and (to descend to particulars) the [[people]] are to be taught, first, that
they ought not to be in [[love]] with any forme of [[government]] they see
in their neighbour nations, more than with their own, nor (whatsoever
present [[prosperity]] they behold in nations that are otherwise governed
than they,) to [[desire]] [[change]]. for the [[prosperity]] of a [[people]] ruled by
an aristocraticall, or democraticall assembly, commeth not from
aristocracy, nor from [[democracy]], but from the [[obedience]], and concord of
the subjects [[subject]]; nor do the [[people]] flourish in a [[monarchy]], because one man
has the [[right]] to [[rule]] them, but because they obey him. take away in
any [[kind]] of [[state]], the [[obedience]], (and consequently the concord of the
people,) and they shall not onely not flourish, but in short [[time]] be
dissolved. and they that go about by disobedience, to doe no more than
reforme the common-wealth, shall find they do thereby [[destroy]] it; like
the foolish daughters [[daughter]] of peleus (in the fable;) which desiring to renew
the [[youth]] of their decrepit [[father]], did by the counsell of medea, cut
him in pieces, and boyle him, together with [[strange]] herbs, but made not
of him a new [[man]]. this [[desire]] of [[change]], is like the breach of the first
of gods commandements: for there [[god]] says, non habebis deos alienos;
thou shalt not have the gods of other nations; and in another place
concerning kings [[king]], that they are gods.




nor adhere (against the soveraign) to popular men

secondly, they are to be taught, that they ought not to be [[led]] with
admiration of the vertue of any of their fellow subjects [[subject]], how
high soever he stand, nor how conspicuously soever he shine in the
common-wealth; nor of any assembly, (except the soveraign assembly,)
so as to deferre to them any [[obedience]], or [[honour]], appropriate to the
soveraign onely, whom (in their particular stations) they represent; nor
to receive any influence from them, but such as is conveighed by them
from the soveraign [[authority]]. for that soveraign, cannot be imagined to
love his [[people]] as he ought, that is not [[jealous]] of them, but suffers
them by the [[flattery]] of popular [[men]], to be seduced from their loyalty,
as they have often been, not onely secretly, but openly, so as to
proclaime [[marriage]] with them in facie ecclesiae by preachers; and by
publishing the same in the open streets: which may fitly be compared to
the violation of the second of the ten commandements.



nor to dispute the soveraign power

thirdly, in consequence to this, they ought to be informed, how great
fault it is, to speak evill of the soveraign representative, (whether
one [[man]], or an assembly of [[men]];) or to argue and dispute his [[power]], or
any way to use his name irreverently, whereby he may be brought into
contempt with his [[people]], and their [[obedience]] (in which the safety
of the common-wealth consisteth) slackened. which doctrine the third
commandement by resemblance pointeth to.




and to have dayes set apart to learn their duty

fourthly, seeing [[people]] cannot be taught this, nor when ’tis taught,
remember it, nor after one [[generation]] [[past]], so much as [[know]] in whom the
soveraign [[power]] is placed, without setting a part from their ordinary
labour, some [[certain]] times [[time]], in which they may attend those that are
appointed to instruct them; it is necessary that some such times [[time]] be
determined, wherein they may assemble together, and (after prayers and
praises given to [[god]], the soveraign of soveraigns) hear those their
duties told them, and the positive lawes, such as generally concern them
all, [[read]] and expounded, and be put in [[mind]] of the [[authority]] that maketh
them lawes. to this end had the jewes every seventh day, a [[sabbath]], in
which the [[law]] was [[read]] and expounded; and in the solemnity whereof they
were put in [[mind]], that their [[king]] was [[god]]; that having created the world
in six days, he rested the seventh day; and by their resting on it from
their [[labour]], that that [[god]] was their [[king]], which redeemed them from
their servile, and painfull [[labour]] in [[egypt]], and gave them a [[time]], after
they had rejoyced in [[god]], to take joy also in themselves, by lawfull
recreation. so that the first table of the commandements, is spent all,
in setting down the summe of gods absolute [[power]]; not onely as [[god]],
but as [[king]] by pact, (in peculiar) of the jewes; and may therefore give
light, to those that have the soveraign [[power]] conferred on them by the
consent of [[men]], to see what doctrine they ought to [[teach]] their subjects [[subject]].




and to [[honour]] their parents

and because the first instruction of [[children]], dependeth on the care
of their parents; it is necessary that they should be [[obedient]] to them,
whilest they are under their tuition; and not onely so, but that also
afterwards (as gratitude requireth,) they acknowledge the benefit of
their [[education]], by externall signes of [[honour]]. to which end they are
to be taught, that originally the [[father]] of every [[man]] was also his
soveraign [[lord]], with [[power]] over him of [[life]] and [[death]]; and that the
fathers of families [[family]], when by instituting a common-wealth, they resigned
that absolute [[power]], yet it was never intended, they should lose the
honour due unto them for their [[education]]. for to relinquish such [[right]],
was not necessary to the institution of soveraign [[power]]; nor would there
be any [[reason]], why any [[man]] should [[desire]] to have [[children]], or take the
care to nourish, and instruct them, if they were afterwards to have no
other benefit from them, than from other [[men]]. and this accordeth with
the fifth commandement.




and to avoyd doing of injury:

again, every soveraign ought to cause [[justice]] to be taught, which
(consisting in taking from no [[man]] what is his) is as much as to say, to
cause [[men]] to be taught not to deprive their neighbour, by [[violence]],
or fraud, of any thing which by the soveraign [[authority]] is theirs. of
things held in propriety, those that are dearest to a [[man]] are his own
life, & limbs; and in the next [[degree]], (in most [[men]],) those that
concern conjugall affection; and after them riches [[rich]] and means of living.
therefore the [[people]] are to be taught, to abstain from [[violence]] to
one anothers [[person]], by private revenges; from violation of conjugall
honour; and from forcibly rapine, and fraudulent surreption of one
anothers goods [[good]]. for which [[purpose]] also it is necessary they be shewed
the evill consequences of false judgement, by [[corruption]] either of
judges or witnesses, whereby the distinction of propriety is taken away,
and [[justice]] becomes of no effect: all which things are intimated in the
sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth commandements.




and to do all this sincerely from the heart

lastly, they are to be taught, that not onely the [[unjust]] facts [[fact]], but the
designes and intentions to do them, (though by accident hindred,) are
injustice; which consisteth in the pravity of the will, as well as in
the irregularity of the act. and this is the intention of the tenth
commandement, and the summe of the second table; which is reduced all to
this one commandement of mutuall charity, "thou shalt [[love]] thy neighbour
as thy selfe:" as the summe of the first table is reduced to "the love
of [[god]];" whom they had then newly received as their [[king]].




the use of universities

as for the means, and conduits, by which the [[people]] may receive this
instruction, wee are to search, by what means so may opinions [[opinion]],
contrary to the [[peace]] of man-kind, upon [[weak]] and false principles [[principle]], have
neverthelesse been so deeply rooted in them. i mean those, which i have
in the precedent [[chapter]] specified: as that [[men]] shall [[judge]] of what is
lawfull and unlawfull, not by the [[law]] it selfe, but by their own
private judgements; that subjects [[subject]] sinne in obeying the commands of the
common-wealth, unlesse they themselves have first judged them to be
lawfull: that their propriety in their riches [[rich]] is such, as to exclude the
dominion, which the common-wealth hath over the same: that it is lawfull
for subjects [[subject]] to kill such, as they call tyrants [[tyrant]]: that the soveraign
power may be divided, and the like; which come to be instilled into
the [[people]] by this means. they whom necessity, or covetousnesse keepeth
attent on their trades [[trade]], and [[labour]]; and they, on the other side, whom
superfluity, or sloth carrieth after their sensuall pleasures [[pleasure]], (which
two sorts of [[men]] take up the [[greatest]] part of man-kind,) being diverted
from the deep meditation, which the learning of [[truth]], not onely in the
matter of naturall [[justice]], but also of all other sciences [[science]] necessarily
requireth, receive the notions of their [[duty]], chiefly from divines
in the pulpit, and partly from such of their neighbours, or familiar
acquaintance, as having the faculty of discoursing readily, and
plausibly, seem wiser and [[better]] learned in cases of [[law]], and
conscience, than themselves. and the divines, and such others as make
shew of learning, derive their [[knowledge]] from the universities [[university]], and from
the schooles of [[law]], or from the books [[book]], which by [[men]] eminent in
those schooles, and universities [[university]] have been published. it is therefore
manifest, that the instruction of the [[people]], dependeth wholly, on the
right teaching of [[youth]] in the universities [[university]]. but are not (may some men
say) the universities [[university]] of [[england]] learned enough already to do that? or
is it you will undertake to [[teach]] the universities [[university]]? hard questions [[question]]. yet
to the first, i [[doubt]] not to [[answer]]; that till towards the later end of
henry the eighth, the [[power]] of the [[pope]], was alwayes upheld against the
power of the common-wealth, principally by the universities [[university]]; and that
the doctrines maintained by so many preachers, against the soveraign
power of the [[king]], and by so many lawyers, and others, that had their
education there, is a sufficient argument, that though the universities
were not authors of those false doctrines, yet they knew not how to
plant the true. for in such a contradiction of opinions [[opinion]], it is most
certain, that they have not been sufficiently instructed; and ’tis no
wonder, if they yet retain a relish of that subtile liquor, wherewith
they were first seasoned, against the civill [[authority]]. but to the later
question, it is not fit, nor needfull for me to say either i, or no: for
any [[man]] that sees what i am doing, may easily perceive what i [[think]].

the safety of the [[people]], requireth further, from him, or them that have
the soveraign [[power]], that [[justice]] be equally administred to all degrees
of [[people]]; that is, that as well the [[rich]], and mighty, as [[poor]] and
obscure persons [[person]], may be righted of the injuries done them; so as the
great, may have no greater [[hope]] of impunity, when they doe [[violence]],
dishonour, or any injury to the meaner sort, than when one of these,
does the like to one of them: for in this consisteth equity; to which,
as being a precept of the [[law]] of [[nature]], a soveraign is as much [[subject]],
as any of the meanest of his [[people]]. all breaches of the [[law]], are
offences against the common-wealth: but there be some, that are also
against private persons [[person]]. those that concern the common-wealth onely, may
without breach of equity be pardoned; for every [[man]] may pardon what is
done against himselfe, according to his own discretion. but an offence
against a private [[man]], cannot in equity be pardoned, without the consent
of him that is injured; or reasonable satisfaction.

the inequality of subjects [[subject]], proceedeth from the acts of soveraign [[power]];
and therefore has no more place in the presence of the soveraign; that
is to say, in a court of [[justice]], then the inequality between kings [[king]],
and their subjects [[subject]], in the presence of the [[king]] of kings [[king]]. the [[honour]] of
great persons [[person]], is to be valued for their beneficence, and the aydes
they give to [[men]] of inferiour rank, or not at all. and the violences,
oppressions, and injuries they do, are not extenuated, but aggravated by
the greatnesse of their persons [[person]]; because they have least need to commit
them. the consequences of this partiality towards the [[great]], proceed in
this manner. impunity maketh insolence; insolence [[hatred]]; and [[hatred]],
an endeavour to pull down all oppressing and contumelious greatnesse,
though with the ruine of the common-wealth.




equall taxes

to equall [[justice]], appertaineth also the equall imposition of taxes;
the equality whereof dependeth not on the equality of riches [[rich]], but on the
equality of the debt, that every [[man]] oweth to the common-wealth for his
defence. it is not enough, for a [[man]] to [[labour]] for the maintenance
of his [[life]]; but also to [[fight]], (if need be,) for the securing of his
labour. they must either do as the jewes did after their return from
captivity, in re-edifying the temple, build with one hand, and hold the
sword in the other; or else they must hire others to [[fight]] for them. for
the impositions that are layd on the [[people]] by the soveraign [[power]], are
nothing else but the wages, due to them that hold the publique [[sword]],
to defend private [[men]] in the exercise of severall trades [[trade]], and callings.
seeing then the benefit that every one receiveth thereby, is the
enjoyment of [[life]], which is equally dear to [[poor]], and [[rich]]; the debt
which a [[poor]] [[man]] oweth them that defend his [[life]], is the same which a
rich [[man]] oweth for the defence of his; saving that the [[rich]], who have
the service of the [[poor]], may be debtors not onely for their own persons [[person]],
but for many more. which considered, the equality of imposition,
consisteth rather in the equality of that which is consumed, than of the
riches of the persons [[person]] that consume the same. for what [[reason]] is there,
that he which laboureth much, and sparing the fruits of his [[labour]],
consumeth little, should be more charged, then he that living idlely,
getteth little, and spendeth all he gets; seeing the one hath no
more protection from the common-wealth, then the other? but when the
impositions, are layd upon those things which [[men]] consume, every man
payeth equally for what he useth: nor is the common-wealth defrauded, by
the luxurious waste of private [[men]].




publique charity

and whereas many [[men]], by accident unevitable, become unable to maintain
themselves by their [[labour]]; they ought not to be left to the charity
of private persons [[person]]; but to be provided for, (as far-forth as the
necessities of [[nature]] require,) by the lawes of the common-wealth. for
as it is uncharitablenesse in any [[man]], to neglect the impotent; so it
is in the soveraign of a common-wealth, to expose them to the hazard of
such uncertain charity.




prevention of idlenesse

but for such as have [[strong]] bodies [[body]], the case is otherwise: they are to
be forced to [[work]]; and to avoyd the excuse of not finding employment,
there ought to be such lawes, as may encourage all manner of [[arts]]; as
navigation, agriculture, fishing, and all manner of manifacture that
requires [[labour]]. the multitude of [[poor]], and yet [[strong]] [[people]] still
encreasing, they are to be transplanted into countries [[country]] not sufficiently
inhabited: where neverthelesse, they are not to exterminate those they
find there; but constrain them to inhabit closer together, and not range
a [[great]] deal of ground, to snatch what they find; but to court each
little plot with art [[arts]] and [[labour]], to give them their sustenance in due
season. and when all the [[world]] is overchargd with inhabitants, then the
last remedy of all is warre; which provideth for every [[man]], by [[victory]],
or [[death]].




good lawes what

to the [[care]] of the soveraign, belongeth the making of [[good]] lawes. but
what is a [[good]] [[law]]? by a [[good]] [[law]], i mean not a just [[law]]: for no [[law]] can
be [[unjust]]. the [[law]] is made by the soveraign [[power]], and all that is done
by such [[power]], is warranted, and owned by every one of the [[people]]; and
that which every [[man]] will have so, no [[man]] can say is [[unjust]]. it is in
the lawes of a common-wealth, as in the lawes of gaming: whatsoever
the gamesters all agree on, is [[injustice]] to none of them. a [[good]] law
is that, which is needfull, for the [[good]] of the [[people]], and withall
perspicuous.




such as are necessary

for the use of lawes, (which are but rules [[rule]] authorised) is not to bind
the [[people]] from all voluntary actions; but to direct and keep them in
such a motion, as not to hurt themselves by their own impetuous desires [[desire]],
rashnesse, or indiscretion, as hedges are set, not to stop travellers,
but to keep them in the way. and therefore a [[law]] that is not needfull,
having not the true end of a [[law]], is not [[good]]. a [[law]] may be conceived to
be [[good]], when it is for the benefit of the soveraign; though it be
not necessary for the [[people]]; but it is not so. for the [[good]] of the
soveraign and [[people]], cannot be separated. it is a [[weak]] soveraign, that
has [[weak]] subjects [[subject]]; and a [[weak]] [[people]], whose soveraign wanteth [[power]] to
rule them at his will. unnecessary lawes are not [[good]] lawes; but trapps
for mony: which where the [[right]] of soveraign [[power]] is acknowledged, are
superfluous; and where it is not acknowledged, unsufficient to defend
the [[people]].




such as are perspicuous

the perspicuity, consisteth not so much in the words of the [[law]] it
selfe, as in a declaration of the causes, and motives, for which it was
made. that is it, that shewes us the meaning of the legislator, and the
meaning of the legislator known, the [[law]] is more easily understood
by few, than many words. for all words, are [[subject]] to ambiguity;
and therefore multiplication of words in the [[body]] of the [[law]], is
multiplication of ambiguity: besides it seems to imply, (by too much
diligence,) that whosoever can evade the words, is without the compasse
of the [[law]]. and this is a cause of many unnecessary processes. for when
i consider how short were the lawes of antient times [[time]]; and how they
grew by degrees [[degree]] still longer; me thinks [[think]] i see a contention between the
penners, and pleaders of the [[law]]; the former seeking to circumscribe
the later; and the later to evade their circumscriptions; and that the
pleaders have got the [[victory]]. it belongeth therefore to the office of
a legislator, (such as is in all common-wealths the supreme
representative, be it one [[man]], or an assembly,) to make the reason
perspicuous, why the [[law]] was made; and the [[body]] of the [[law]] it selfe, as
short, but in as proper, and significant termes, as may be.




punishments

it belongeth also to the office of the soveraign, to make a right
application of punishments [[punishment]], and rewards [[reward]]. and seeing the end of punishing
is not [[revenge]], and discharge of choler; but correction, either of the
offender, or of others by his [[example]]; the severest punishments [[punishment]] are to
be inflicted for those crimes, that are of most danger to the
publique; such as are those which proceed from malice to the government
established; those that spring from contempt of [[justice]]; those that
provoke indignation in the multitude; and those, which unpunished, seem
authorised, as when they are committed by sonnes, servants, or favorites
of [[men]] in [[authority]]: for indignation carrieth [[men]], not onely against the
actors, and authors of [[injustice]]; but against all [[power]] that is likely
to [[protect]] them; as in the case of tarquin; when for the insolent act of
one of his sonnes, he was driven out of [[rome]], and the [[monarchy]] it selfe
dissolved. but crimes of infirmity; such as are those which proceed
from [[great]] provocation, from [[great]] [[fear]], [[great]] need, or from ignorance
whether the [[fact]] be a [[great]] crime, or not, there is place many times [[time]] for
lenity, without prejudice to the common-wealth; and lenity when there is
such place for it, is required by the [[law]] of [[nature]]. the [[punishment]] of
the leaders, and teachers in a commotion; not the poore seduced [[people]],
when they are punished, can [[profit]] the common-wealth by their [[example]].
to be severe to the [[people]], is to punish that ignorance, which may in
great part be imputed to the soveraign, whose [[fault]] it was, they were no
better instructed.




rewards

in like manner it belongeth to the office, and [[duty]] of the soveraign,
to apply his rewards [[reward]] alwayes so, as there may arise from them benefit
to the common-wealth: wherein consisteth their use, and end; and is then
done, when they that have well served the common-wealth, are with
as little expence of the [[common]] treasure, as is possible, so well
recompenced, as others thereby may be encouraged, both to serve the same
as faithfully as they can, and to study the [[arts]] by which they may be
enabled to do it [[better]]. to buy with mony, or preferment, from a popular
ambitious [[subject]], to be quiet, and desist from making ill impressions
in the mindes of the [[people]], has nothing of the [[nature]] of [[reward]]; (which
is ordained not for disservice, but for service [[past]];) nor a signe of
gratitude, but of [[fear]]: nor does it tend to the benefit, but to the
dammage of the publique. it is a contention with [[ambition]], like that of
hercules with the monster hydra, which having many heads, for every one
that was vanquished, there grew up three. for in like manner, when the
stubbornnesse of one popular [[man]], is overcome with [[reward]], there arise
many more (by the example) that do the same mischiefe, in [[hope]] of like
benefit: and as all sorts of manifacture, so also malice encreaseth by
being vendible. and though sometimes a civill warre, may be differred,
by such wayes as that, yet the danger growes still the greater, and the
publique ruine more assured. it is therefore against the [[duty]] of the
soveraign, to whom the publique safety is committed, to [[reward]] those
that aspire to greatnesse by disturbing the [[peace]] of their [[country]], and
not rather to oppose the beginnings of such [[men]], with a little danger,
than after a longer [[time]] with greater.




counsellours

another businesse of the soveraign, is to choose [[good]] counsellours;
i mean such, whose [[advice]] he is to take in the [[government]] of the
common-wealth. for this word counsell, consilium, corrupted from
considium, is a large signification, and comprehendeth all assemblies
of [[men]] that sit together, not onely to deliberate what is to be done
hereafter, but also to [[judge]] of facts [[fact]] [[past]], and of [[law]] for the [[present]].
i take it here in the first sense onely: and in this sense, there is no
choyce of counsell, neither in a [[democracy]], nor [[aristocracy]]; because the
persons counselling are members of the [[person]] counselled. the choyce
of counsellours therefore is to [[monarchy]]; in which, the soveraign that
endeavoureth not to make choyce of those, that in every [[kind]] are the
most able, dischargeth not his office as he ought to do. the most able
counsellours, are they that have least [[hope]] of benefit by giving evill
counsell, and most [[knowledge]] of those things that conduce to the [[peace]],
and defence of the common-wealth. it is a hard matter to [[know]] who
expecteth benefit from publique troubles; but the signes that guide to a
just suspicion, is the soothing of the [[people]] in their unreasonable,
or irremediable grievances, by [[men]] whose estates are not sufficient to
discharge their accustomed expences, and may easily be observed by any
one whom it concerns to [[know]] it. but to [[know]], who has most [[knowledge]] of
the publique affaires, is yet harder; and they that [[know]] them, need them
a [[great]] deale the lesse. for to [[know]], who knowes the rules [[rule]] almost of any
art, is a [[great]] [[degree]] of the [[knowledge]] of the same art [[arts]]; because no
man can be assured of the [[truth]] of anothers rules [[rule]], but he that is first
taught to [[understand]] them. but the [[best]] signes of [[knowledge]] of any
art, are, much conversing in it, and constant [[good]] effects of it. good
counsell comes not by lot, nor by [[inheritance]]; and therefore there is no
more [[reason]] to expect [[good]] [[advice]] from the [[rich]], or [[noble]], in matter
of [[state]], than in delineating the dimensions of a fortresse; unlesse we
shall [[think]] there needs no method in the study of the politiques, (as
there does in the study of geometry,) but onely to be lookers on; which
is not so. for the politiques is the harder study of the two. whereas
in these parts of [[europe]], it hath been taken for a [[right]] of certain
persons, to have place in the highest councell of [[state]] by [[inheritance]];
it is derived from the conquests of the antient germans; wherein many
absolute lords [[lord]] joyning together to conquer other nations, would not
enter in to the confederacy, without such priviledges, as might be
marks of difference in [[time]] following, between their [[posterity]], and the
posterity of their subjects [[subject]]; which priviledges being inconsistent with
the soveraign [[power]], by the favour of the soveraign, they may seem to
keep; but contending for them as their [[right]], they must needs by
degrees let them go, and have at [[last]] no further [[honour]], than adhaereth
naturally to their abilities.

and how able soever be the counsellours in any affaire, the benefit
of their counsell is greater, when they give every one his [[advice]], and
reasons of it apart, than when they do it in an assembly, by way of
orations; and when they have praemeditated, than when they speak on the
sudden; both because they have more [[time]], to survey the consequences
of action; and are lesse [[subject]] to be carried away to contradiction,
through envy, emulation, or other [[passions]] arising from the difference
of [[opinion]].

the [[best]] counsell, in those things that concern not other nations, but
onely the ease, and benefit the subjects [[subject]] may enjoy, by lawes that
look onely inward, is to be taken from the generall informations, and
complaints of the [[people]] of each province, who are [[best]] acquainted
with their own wants, and ought therefore, when they demand nothing in
derogation of the essentiall rights [[right]] of soveraignty, to be diligently
taken notice of. for without those essentiall rights [[right]], (as i have often
before said,) the common-wealth cannot at all subsist.




commanders

a commander of an [[army]] in chiefe, if he be not popular, shall not be
beloved, nor feared as he ought to be by his [[army]]; and consequently
cannot performe that office with [[good]] successe. he must therefore be
industrious, valiant, affable, liberall and fortunate, that he may gain
an [[opinion]] both of sufficiency, and of loving his souldiers. this is
popularity, and breeds in the souldiers both [[desire]], and [[courage]], to
recommend themselves to his favour; and protects the severity of
the generall, in punishing (when need is) the mutinous, or negligent
souldiers. but this [[love]] of souldiers, (if caution be not given of
the commanders fidelity,) is a dangerous thing to soveraign [[power]];
especially when it is in the hands of an assembly not popular. it
belongeth therefore to the safety of the [[people]], both that they be good
conductors, and faithfull subjects [[subject]], to whom the soveraign commits his
armies.

but when the soveraign himselfe is popular, that is, reverenced and
beloved of his [[people]], there is no danger at all from the popularity of
a [[subject]]. for souldiers are never so generally [[unjust]], as to side with
their captain; though they [[love]] him, against their soveraign, when they
love not onely his [[person]], but also his cause. and therefore those,
who by [[violence]] have at any [[time]] suppressed the [[power]] of their lawfull
soveraign, before they could settle themselves in his place, have been
alwayes put to the trouble of contriving their titles, to save the
people from the shame of receiving them. to have a known [[right]] to
soveraign [[power]], is so popular a quality, as he that has it needs no
more, for his own part, to turn the hearts [[heart]] of his subjects [[subject]] to him, but
that they see him able absolutely to govern his own [[family]]: nor, on the
part of his enemies [[enemy]], but a disbanding of their armies [[army]]. for the greatest
and most active part of [[mankind]], has never hetherto been well contented
with the [[present]].

concerning the offices of one soveraign to another, which are
comprehended in that [[law]], which is commonly called the [[law]] of nations,
i need not say any thing in this place; because the [[law]] of nations, and
the [[law]] of [[nature]], is the same thing. and every soveraign hath the same
right, in procuring the safety of his [[people]], that any particular man
can have, in procuring the safety of his own [[body]]. and the same [[law]],
that dictateth to [[men]] that have no civil [[government]], what they ought to
do, and what to avoyd in regard of one another, dictateth the same to
common-wealths, that is, to the consciences of soveraign princes [[prince]], and
soveraign assemblies; there being no court of naturall [[justice]], but
in the [[conscience]] onely; where not [[man]], but [[god]] raigneth; whose lawes,
(such of them as oblige all [[mankind]],) in [[respect]] of [[god]], as he is the
author of [[nature]], are naturall; and in [[respect]] of the same [[god]], as he is
king of kings [[king]], are lawes. but of the kingdome of [[god]], as [[king]] of kings [[king]],
and as [[king]] also of a peculiar [[people]], i shall speak in the rest of this
discourse.



chapter xxxi. of the kingdome of [[god]] by nature




the scope of the following chapters

that the condition of meer [[nature]], that is to say, of absolute [[liberty]],
such as is theirs, that neither are soveraigns, nor subjects [[subject]], is
anarchy, and the condition of warre: that the praecepts, by which men
are guided to avoyd that condition, are the lawes of [[nature]]: that
a common-wealth, without soveraign [[power]], is but a word, without
substance, and cannot stand: that subjects [[subject]] owe to soveraigns, simple
obedience, in all things, wherein their [[obedience]] is not repugnant
to the lawes of [[god]], i have sufficiently proved, in that which i have
already written. there wants onely, for the entire [[knowledge]] of civill
duty, to [[know]] what are those lawes of [[god]]. for without that, a [[man]] knows
not, when he is commanded any thing by the civill [[power]], whether it be
contrary to the [[law]] of [[god]], or not: and so, either by too much civill
obedience, offends the [[divine]] majesty, or through feare of offending
god, transgresses the commandements of the common-wealth. to avoyd both
these rocks, it is necessary to [[know]] what are the lawes [[divine]]. and
seeing the [[knowledge]] of all [[law]], dependeth on the [[knowledge]] of the
soveraign [[power]]; i shall say something in that which followeth, of the
kingdome of [[god]].




who are subjects [[subject]] in the kingdome of god

"god is [[king]], let the [[earth]] rejoice," saith the psalmist. (psal. 96. 1).
and again, "god is [[king]] though the nations be angry; and he that sitteth
on the cherubins, though the [[earth]] be moved." (psal. 98. 1). whether
men will or not, they must be [[subject]] alwayes to the [[divine]] [[power]]. by
denying the existence, or providence of [[god]], [[men]] may shake off their
ease, but not their yoke. but to call this [[power]] of [[god]], which extendeth
it selfe not onely to [[man]], but also to beasts, and plants, and bodies
inanimate, by the name of kingdome, is but a metaphoricall use of
the word. for he onely is properly said to raigne, that governs his
subjects, by his word, and by promise of rewards [[reward]] to those that obey
it, and by threatning them with [[punishment]] that obey it not. subjects
therefore in the kingdome of [[god]], are not bodies [[body]] inanimate, nor
creatures irrationall; because they [[understand]] no precepts as his: nor
atheists; nor they that [[believe]] not that [[god]] has any [[care]] of the actions
of [[mankind]]; because they acknowledge no word for his, nor have [[hope]] of
his rewards [[reward]], or [[fear]] of his threatnings. they therefore that believe
there is a [[god]] that governeth the [[world]], and hath given praecepts, and
propounded rewards [[reward]], and punishments [[punishment]] to [[mankind]], are gods subjects [[subject]]; all
the rest, are to be understood as enemies [[enemy]].




a threefold word of [[god]], [[reason]], revelation, prophecy

to [[rule]] by words, requires that such words be manifestly made known;
for else they are no lawes: for to the [[nature]] of lawes belongeth a
sufficient, and clear promulgation, such as may take away the excuse of
ignorance; which in the lawes of [[men]] is but of one onely [[kind]], and that
is, proclamation, or promulgation by the voyce of [[man]]. but god
declareth his lawes three wayes; by the dictates of naturall [[reason]], by
revelation, and by the voyce of some [[man]], to whom by the operation of
miracles, he procureth credit with the rest. from hence there ariseth
a triple word of [[god]], [[rational]], sensible, and prophetique: to which
correspondeth a triple hearing; [[right]] [[reason]], sense supernaturall, and
faith. as for sense supernaturall, which consisteth in revelation, or
inspiration, there have not been any universall lawes so given, because
god speaketh not in that manner, but to particular persons [[person]], and to
divers [[men]] divers things.

a twofold kingdome of [[god]], naturall and prophetique from the difference
between the other two kinds [[kind]] of gods word, rationall, and prophetique,
there may be attributed to [[god]], a two-fold kingdome, naturall, and
prophetique: naturall, wherein he governeth as many of [[mankind]] as
acknowledge his providence, by the naturall dictates of [[right]] [[reason]];
and prophetique, wherein having chosen out one peculiar nation (the
jewes) for his subjects [[subject]], he governed them, and none but them, not onely
by naturall [[reason]], but by positive lawes, which he gave them by the
mouths of his holy prophets [[prophet]]. of the naturall kingdome of [[god]] i intend to
speak in this [[chapter]].

the [[right]] of gods soveraignty is derived from his omnipotence the right
of [[nature]], whereby [[god]] reigneth over [[men]], and punisheth those that
break his lawes, is to be derived, not from his creating them, as if
he required [[obedience]], as of gratitude for his benefits; but from his
irresistible [[power]]. i have formerly shewn, how the soveraign right
ariseth from pact: to shew how the same [[right]] may arise from [[nature]],
requires no more, but to shew in what case it is never taken away.
seeing all [[men]] by [[nature]] had [[right]] to all things, they had [[right]] every
one to reigne over all the rest. but because this [[right]] could not be
obtained by [[force]], it concerned the safety of every one, laying by that
right, to set up [[men]] (with soveraign authority) by [[common]] [[consent]],
to [[rule]] and defend them: whereas if there had been any [[man]] of power
irresistible; there had been no [[reason]], why he should not by that power
have ruled, and defended both himselfe, and them, according to his own
discretion. to those therefore whose [[power]] is irresistible, the dominion
of all [[men]] adhaereth naturally by their excellence of [[power]]; and
consequently it is from that [[power]], that the kingdome over [[men]], and
the [[right]] of afflicting [[men]] at his [[pleasure]], belongeth naturally to god
almighty; not as creator, and gracious; but as omnipotent. and though
punishment be due for sinne onely, because by that word is understood
affliction for sinne; yet the [[right]] of afflicting, is not alwayes
derived from mens [[men]] sinne, but from gods [[power]].




sinne not the cause of all affliction

this [[question]], "why evill [[men]] often [[prosper]], and [[good]] [[men]] suffer
adversity," has been much disputed by the antient, and is the same
with this of ours, "by what [[right]] [[god]] dispenseth the prosperities and
adversities of this [[life]];" and is of that difficulty, as it hath shaken
the [[faith]], not onely of the vulgar, but of [[philosophers]], and which is
more, of the saints, concerning the [[divine]] providence. "how [[good]]," saith
david, "is the [[god]] of [[israel]] to those that are upright in [[heart]]; and yet
my feet were almost gone, my treadings had well-nigh slipt; for i was
grieved at the wicked, when i saw the ungodly in such [[prosperity]]."
and [[job]], how earnestly does he expostulate with [[god]], for the many
afflictions he [[suffered]], notwithstanding his righteousnesse? this
question in the case of [[job]], is decided by [[god]] himselfe, not by
arguments derived from job’s sinne, but his own [[power]]. for whereas the
friends of [[job]] drew their arguments from his affliction to his sinne,
and he defended himselfe by the [[conscience]] of his innocence, god
himselfe taketh up the matter, and having justified the affliction by
arguments drawn from his [[power]], such as this "where was thou when i
layd the foundations of the [[earth]]," and the like, both approved
job’s innocence, and reproved the erroneous doctrine of his [[friends]].
conformable to this doctrine is the sentence of our saviour, concerning
the [[man]] that was born blind, in these words, "neither hath this man
sinned, nor his fathers [[father]]; but that the works [[work]] of [[god]] might be made
manifest in him." and though it be said "that [[death]] entred into the
world by sinne," (by which is meant that if adam had never sinned, he had
never dyed, that is, never [[suffered]] any separation of his soule from his
body,) it follows not thence, that [[god]] could not justly have afflicted
him, though he had not sinned, as well as he afflicteth other living
creatures, that cannot sinne.




divine lawes

having spoken of the [[right]] of gods soveraignty, as grounded onely on
nature; we are to consider next, what are the [[divine]] lawes, or dictates
of naturall [[reason]]; which lawes concern either the naturall duties [[duty]] of
one [[man]] to another, or the [[honour]] naturally due to our [[divine]] soveraign.
the first are the same lawes of [[nature]], of which i have spoken already
in the 14. and 15. chapters [[chapter]] of this treatise; namely, equity, [[justice]],
mercy, [[humility]], and the rest of the morall vertues. it remaineth
therefore that we consider, what praecepts are dictated to [[men]], by their
naturall [[reason]] onely, without other word of [[god]], touching the honour
and [[worship]] of the [[divine]] majesty.




honour and [[worship]] what

honour consisteth in the inward [[thought]], and [[opinion]] of the [[power]], and
goodnesse of another: and therefore to [[honour]] [[god]], is to [[think]] as highly
of his [[power]] and goodnesse, as is possible. and of that [[opinion]], the
externall signes appearing in the words, and actions of [[men]], are called
worship; which is one part of that which the latines [[understand]] by the
word cultus: for cultus signifieth properly, and constantly, that labour
which a [[man]] bestowes on any thing, with a [[purpose]] to make benefit by it.
now those things whereof we make benefit, are either [[subject]] to us, and
the [[profit]] they yeeld, followeth the [[labour]] we bestow upon them, as a
naturall effect; or they are not [[subject]] to us, but [[answer]] our [[labour]],
according to their own wills. in the first sense the [[labour]] bestowed on
the [[earth]], is called [[culture]]; and the [[education]] of [[children]] a [[culture]] of
their mindes. in the second sense, where mens [[men]] wills are to be wrought to
our [[purpose]], not by [[force]], but by compleasance, it signifieth as much as
courting, that is, a winning of favour by [[good]] offices; as by praises [[praise]],
by acknowledging their [[power]], and by whatsoever is pleasing to them from
whom we look for any benefit. and this is properly [[worship]]: in which
sense publicola, is understood for a worshipper of the [[people]], and
cultus dei, for the [[worship]] of [[god]].




severall signes of honour

from internall [[honour]], consisting in the [[opinion]] of [[power]] and goodnesse,
arise three [[passions]]; [[love]], which hath reference to goodnesse; and [[hope]],
and [[fear]], that relate to [[power]]: and three parts of externall [[worship]];
praise, magnifying, and blessing: the [[subject]] of [[praise]], being
goodnesse; the [[subject]] of magnifying, and blessing, being [[power]], and the
effect thereof felicity. [[praise]], and magnifying are significant both by
words, and actions: by words, when we say a [[man]] is [[good]], or [[great]]:
by actions, when we thank him for his bounty, and obey his [[power]]. the
opinion of the happinesse of another, can onely be expressed by words.




worship naturall and arbitrary

there be some signes of [[honour]], (both in attributes and actions,) that
be naturally so; as amongst attributes, [[good]], just, liberall, and the
like; and amongst actions, prayers, thanks, and [[obedience]]. others are
so by institution, or custome of [[men]]; and in some times [[time]] and places are
honourable; in others dishonourable; in others indifferent: such as are
the gestures in salutation, prayer, and thanksgiving, in different
times and places, differently used. the former is naturall; the later
arbitrary [[worship]].




worship commanded and free

and of arbitrary [[worship]], there bee two differences: for sometimes it is
a commanded, sometimes voluntary [[worship]]: commanded, when it is such
as hee requireth, who is worshipped: [[free]], when it is such as the
worshipper thinks [[think]] fit. when it is commanded, not the words, or gestures,
but the [[obedience]] is the [[worship]]. but when [[free]], the [[worship]] consists
in the [[opinion]] of the beholders: for if to them the words, or actions by
which we intend [[honour]], seem ridiculous, and tending to contumely; they
are not [[worship]]; because a signe is not a signe to him that giveth it,
but to him to whom it is made; that is, to the spectator.




worship publique and private

again, there is a publique, and a private [[worship]]. publique, is the
worship that a common-wealth performeth, as one [[person]]. private, is that
which a private [[person]] exhibiteth. publique, in [[respect]] of the whole
common-wealth, is [[free]]; but in [[respect]] of particular [[men]] it is not so.
private, is in secret [[free]]; but in the sight of the multitude, it is
never without some restraint, either from the lawes, or from the opinion
of [[men]]; which is contrary to the [[nature]] of [[liberty]].




the end of worship

the end of [[worship]] amongst [[men]], is [[power]]. for where a [[man]] seeth another
worshipped he supposeth him powerfull, and is the readier to obey him;
which makes his [[power]] greater. but [[god]] has no ends: the [[worship]] we do
him, proceeds from our [[duty]], and is directed according to our capacity,
by those rules [[rule]] of [[honour]], that [[reason]] dictateth to be done by the weak
to the more potent [[men]], in [[hope]] of benefit, for [[fear]] of dammage, or in
thankfulnesse for [[good]] already received from them.




attributes of [[divine]] honour

that we may [[know]] what [[worship]] of [[god]] is taught us by the [[light]] of
nature, i will begin with his attributes. where, first, it is manifest,
we ought to attribute to him existence: for no [[man]] can have the will to
honour that, which he thinks [[think]] not to have any beeing.

secondly, that those [[philosophers]], who sayd the [[world]], or the soule of
the [[world]] was [[god]], spake unworthily of him; and denyed his existence:
for by [[god]], is understood the cause of the [[world]]; and to say the world
is [[god]], is to say there is no cause of it, that is, no [[god]].

thirdly, to say the [[world]] was not created, but eternall, (seeing that
which is eternall has no cause,) is to deny there is a [[god]].

fourthly, that they who attributing (as they think) ease to [[god]], take
from him the [[care]] of [[mankind]]; take from him his [[honour]]: for it takes
away mens [[men]] [[love]], and [[fear]] of him; which is the root of [[honour]].

fifthly, in those things that signifie greatnesse, and [[power]]; to say he
is finite, is not to [[honour]] him: for it is not a signe of the will to
honour [[god]], to attribute to him lesse than we can; and finite, is lesse
than we can; because to finite, it is easie to adde more.

therefore to attribute figure to him, is not [[honour]]; for all figure is
finite:

nor to say we conceive, and imagine, or have an [[idea]] of him, in our
mind: for whatsoever we conceive is finite:

not to attribute to him parts, or totality; which are the attributes
onely of things finite:

nor to say he is this, or that place: for whatsoever is in place, is
bounded, and finite:

nor that he is moved, or resteth: for both these attributes ascribe to
him place:

nor that there be more gods than one; because it implies them all
finite: for there cannot be more than one infinite: nor to ascribe to
him (unlesse metaphorically, meaning not the passion, but the effect)
passions that partake of griefe; as repentance, anger, [[mercy]]: or of
want; as appetite, [[hope]], [[desire]]; or of any passive faculty: for passion,
is [[power]] limited by somewhat else.

and therefore when we ascribe to [[god]] a will, it is not to be understood,
as that of [[man]], for a rationall appetite; but as the [[power]], by which he
effecteth every thing.

likewise when we attribute to him sight, and other acts of sense; as
also [[knowledge]], and understanding; which in us is nothing else, but
a tumult of the [[mind]], raised by externall things that presse the
organicall parts of mans [[man]] [[body]]: for there is no such thing in [[god]]; and
being things that depend on naturall causes, cannot be attributed to
him.

hee that will attribute to [[god]], nothing but what is warranted by
naturall [[reason]], must either use such negative attributes, as infinite,
eternall, incomprehensible; or superlatives, as most high, most [[great]],
and the like; or indefinite, as [[good]], just, holy, creator; and in such
sense, as if he meant not to declare what he is, (for that were to
circumscribe him within the limits of our fancy,) but how much wee
admire him, and how ready we would be to obey him; which is a signe of
humility, and of a will to [[honour]] him as much as we can: for there is
but one name to signifie our conception of his [[nature]], and that is, i
am: and but one name of his relation to us, and that is [[god]]; in which is
contained [[father]], [[king]], and [[lord]].




actions that are signes of [[divine]] honour

concerning the actions of [[divine]] [[worship]], it is a most generall precept
of [[reason]], that they be signes of the intention to [[honour]] [[god]]; such as
are, first, prayers: for not the carvers, when they made images, were
thought to make them gods; but the [[people]] that prayed to them.

secondly, thanksgiving; which differeth from prayer in [[divine]] [[worship]],
no otherwise, than that prayers precede, and thanks succeed the benefit;
the end both of the one, and the other, being to acknowledge [[god]], for
author of all benefits, as well [[past]], as future.

thirdly, gifts; that is to say, sacrifices [[sacrifice]], and oblations, (if they be
of the [[best]],) are signes of [[honour]]: for they are thanksgivings.

fourthly, not to swear by any but [[god]], is naturally a signe of [[honour]]:
for it is a [[confession]] that [[god]] onely knoweth the [[heart]]; and that no
mans wit, or [[strength]] can [[protect]] a [[man]] against gods vengence on the
perjured.

fifthly, it is a part of rationall [[worship]], to speak considerately
of [[god]]; for it argues a [[fear]] of him, and [[fear]], is a [[confession]] of his
power. hence followeth, that the name of [[god]] is not to be used rashly,
and to no [[purpose]]; for that is as much, as in [[vain]]: and it is to
no [[purpose]]; unlesse it be by way of oath, and by order of the
common-wealth, to make judgements [[certain]]; or between common-wealths,
to avoyd warre. and that disputing of gods [[nature]] is contrary to his
honour: for it is supposed, that in this naturall kingdome of [[god]], there
is no other way to [[know]] any thing, but by naturall [[reason]]; that is, from
the principles [[principle]] of naturall [[science]]; which are so farre from teaching us
any thing of gods [[nature]], as they cannot [[teach]] us our own [[nature]], nor
the [[nature]] of the smallest creature living. and therefore, when [[men]] out
of the principles [[principle]] of naturall [[reason]], dispute of the attributes of [[god]],
they but dishonour him: for in the attributes which we give to [[god]], we
are not to consider the signification of philosophicall [[truth]]; but the
signification of pious intention, to do him the [[greatest]] [[honour]] we are
able. from the want of which consideration, have proceeded the volumes
of disputation about the [[nature]] of [[god]], that tend not to his [[honour]], but
to the [[honour]] of our own wits, and learning; and are nothing else but
inconsiderate, and [[vain]] abuses [[abuse]] of his [[sacred]] name.

sixthly, in prayers, thanksgivings, offerings and sacrifices [[sacrifice]], it is a
dictate of naturall [[reason]], that they be every one in his [[kind]] the
best, and most significant of [[honour]]. as for [[example]], that prayers, and
thanksgiving, be made in words and phrases, not sudden, nor [[light]], nor
plebeian; but beautifull and well composed; for else we do not god
as much [[honour]] as we can. and therefore the heathens did absurdly, to
worship images for gods: but their doing it in verse, and with musick,
both of voyce, and instruments, was reasonable. also that the beasts
they offered in [[sacrifice]], and the gifts they offered, and their actions
in worshipping, were full of submission, and commemorative of benefits
received, was according to [[reason]], as proceeding from an intention to
honour him.

seventhly, [[reason]] directeth not onely to [[worship]] [[god]] in secret; but
also, and especially, in publique, and in the sight of [[men]]: for without
that, (that which in [[honour]] is most acceptable) the procuring others to
honour him, is lost.

lastly, [[obedience]] to his lawes (that is, in this case to the lawes
of [[nature]],) is the [[greatest]] [[worship]] of all. for as [[obedience]] is
more acceptable to [[god]] than [[sacrifice]]; so also to set [[light]] by his
commandements, is the [[greatest]] of all contumelies. and these are the
lawes of that [[divine]] [[worship]], which naturall [[reason]] dictateth to private
men.




publique [[worship]] consisteth in uniformity

but seeing a common-wealth is but one [[person]], it ought also to exhibite
to [[god]] but one [[worship]]; which then it doth, when it commandeth it to be
exhibited by private [[men]], publiquely. and this is publique [[worship]]; the
property whereof, is to be uniforme: for those actions that are done
differently, by different [[men]], cannot be said to be a publique [[worship]].
and therefore, where many sorts of [[worship]] be allowed, proceeding from
the different religions [[religion]] of private [[men]], it cannot be said there is any
publique [[worship]], nor that the common-wealth is of any [[religion]] at all.




all attributes depend on the lawes civill

and because words (and consequently the attributes of god) have their
signification by agreement, and [[constitution]] of [[men]]; those attributes
are to be held significative of [[honour]], that [[men]] intend shall so be; and
whatsoever may be done by the wills of particular [[men]], where there is no
law but [[reason]], may be done by the will of the common-wealth, by lawes
civill. and because a common-wealth hath no will, nor makes no lawes,
but those that are made by the will of him, or them that have the
soveraign [[power]]; it followeth, that those attributes which the soveraign
ordaineth, in the [[worship]] of [[god]], for signes of [[honour]], ought to be
taken and used for such, by private [[men]] in their publique [[worship]].




not all actions

but because not all actions are signes by [[constitution]]; but some are
naturally signes of [[honour]], others of contumely, these later (which are
those that [[men]] are ashamed to do in the sight of them they reverence)
cannot be made by humane [[power]] a part of [[divine]] [[worship]]; nor the former
(such as are decent, modest, humble behaviour) ever be separated from
it. but whereas there be an infinite number of actions, and gestures, of
an indifferent [[nature]]; such of them as the common-wealth shall ordain to
be publiquely and universally in use, as signes of [[honour]], and part of
gods [[worship]], are to be taken and used for such by the subjects [[subject]]. and
that which is said in the [[scripture]], "it is [[better]] to obey [[god]] than
men," hath place in the kingdome of [[god]] by pact, and not by [[nature]].




naturall punishments

having thus briefly spoken of the naturall kingdome of [[god]], and his
naturall lawes, i will adde onely to this [[chapter]] a short declaration of
his naturall punishments [[punishment]]. there is no action of [[man]] in this [[life]], that
is not the beginning of so long a chayn of consequences, as no humane
providence, is high enough, to give a [[man]] a prospect to the end. and
in this chayn, there are linked together both pleasing and unpleasing
events; in such manner, as he that will do any thing for his [[pleasure]],
must engage himselfe to suffer all the pains [[pain]] annexed to it; and these
pains, are the naturall punishments [[punishment]] of those actions, which are the
beginning of more harme that [[good]]. and hereby it comes to passe, that
intemperance, is naturally punished with diseases; rashnesse, with
mischances; [[injustice]], with the [[violence]] of enemies [[enemy]]; [[pride]], with ruine;
cowardise, with oppression; negligent [[government]] of princes [[prince]], with
rebellion; and rebellion, with slaughter. for seeing punishments
are consequent to the breach of lawes; naturall punishments [[punishment]] must be
naturally consequent to the breach of the lawes of [[nature]]; and therfore
follow them as their naturall, not arbitrary effects.




the conclusion of the second part

and thus farre concerning the [[constitution]], [[nature]], and [[right]] of
soveraigns; and concerning the [[duty]] of subjects [[subject]], derived from the
principles of naturall [[reason]]. and now, considering how different
this doctrine is, from the practise of the [[greatest]] part of the [[world]],
especially of these western parts, that have received their morall
learning from [[rome]], and [[athens]]; and how much depth of morall philosophy
is required, in them that have the administration of the soveraign
power; i am at the point of believing this my [[labour]], as uselesse,
and the common-wealth of [[plato]]; for he also is of [[opinion]] that it is
impossible for the disorders of [[state]], and [[change]] of governments [[government]] by
civill warre, ever to be taken away, till soveraigns be [[philosophers]].
but when i consider again, that the [[science]] of naturall [[justice]], is the
onely [[science]] necessary for soveraigns, and their principall ministers;
and that they need not be charged with the sciences [[science]] mathematicall, (as
by [[plato]] they are,) further, than by [[good]] lawes to encourage [[men]] to
the study of them; and that neither [[plato]], nor any other philosopher
hitherto, hath put into order, and sufficiently, or probably proved all
the theoremes of morall doctrine, that [[men]] may learn thereby, both how
to govern, and how to obey; i recover some [[hope]], that one [[time]] or other,
this writing of mine, may fall into the hands of a soveraign, who will
consider it himselfe, (for it is short, and i [[think]] clear,) without the
help of any interested, or envious interpreter; and by the exercise of
entire soveraignty, in protecting the publique teaching of it, convert
this [[truth]] of speculation, into the utility of practice.





part iii.
of a [[christian]] common-wealth




chapter xxxii. of the principles [[principle]] of [[christian]] politiques


the word of [[god]] delivered by prophets [[prophet]] is the main principle

of [[christian]] politiques

i have derived the rights [[right]] of soveraigne [[power]], and the [[duty]] of subjects
hitherto, from the principles [[principle]] of [[nature]] onely; such as [[experience]] has
found true, or [[consent]] (concerning the use of words) has made so; that
is to say, from the [[nature]] of [[men]], known to us by [[experience]], and
from definitions (of such words as are essentiall to all politicall
reasoning) universally agreed on. but in that i am next to handle, which
is the [[nature]] and rights [[right]] of a [[christian]] common-wealth, whereof there
dependeth much upon supernaturall revelations of the will of [[god]]; the
ground of my discourse must be, not only the naturall word of [[god]], but
also the propheticall.

neverthelesse, we are not to renounce our senses, and [[experience]]; nor
(that which is the undoubted word of god) our naturall [[reason]]. for they
are the [[talents]] which he hath put into our hands to negotiate, till the
coming again of our blessed saviour; and therefore not to be folded up
in the napkin of an implicate [[faith]], but employed in the purchase of
justice, [[peace]], and true [[religion]], for though there be many things in
gods word above [[reason]]; that is to say, which cannot by naturall reason
be either demonstrated, or confuted; yet there is nothing contrary
to it; but when it seemeth so, the [[fault]] is either in our unskilfull
interpretation, or erroneous ratiocination.

therefore, when any thing therein written is too hard for our
examination, wee are bidden to captivate our understanding to the words;
and not to [[labour]] in sifting out a philosophicall [[truth]] by logick, of
such mysteries as are not comprehensible, nor fall under any [[rule]] of
naturall [[science]]. for it is with the mysteries of our [[religion]], as with
wholsome pills for the sick, which swallowed whole, have the vertue to
cure; but chewed, are for the most part cast up again without effect.




what it is to captivate the understanding

but by the captivity of our understanding, is not meant a submission of
the intellectual faculty, to the [[opinion]] of any other [[man]]; but of
the will to [[obedience]], where [[obedience]] is due. for sense, memory,
understanding, [[reason]], and [[opinion]] are not in our [[power]] to [[change]]; but
alwaies, and necessarily such, as the things we see, hear, and consider
suggest unto us; and therefore are not effects of our will, but our will
of them. we then captivate our understanding and [[reason]], when we forbear
contradiction; when we so speak, as (by lawfull authority) we are
commanded; and when we [[live]] accordingly; which in sum, is trust, and
faith reposed in him that speaketh, though the [[mind]] be incapable of any
notion at all from the words spoken.




how [[god]] speaketh to men

when [[god]] speaketh to [[man]], it must be either immediately; or by mediation
of another [[man]], to whom he had formerly spoken by himself immediately.
how [[god]] speaketh to a [[man]] immediately, may be understood by those well
enough, to whom he hath so spoken; but how the same should be understood
by another, is hard, if not impossible to [[know]]. for if a [[man]] pretend to
me, that [[god]] hath spoken to him supernaturally, and immediately, and i
make [[doubt]] of it, i cannot easily perceive what argument he can [[produce]],
to oblige me to beleeve it. it is true, that if he be my soveraign,
he may oblige me to [[obedience]], so, as not by act or word to declare i
beleeve him not; but not to [[think]] any otherwise then my [[reason]] perswades
me. but if one that hath not such [[authority]] over me, shall pretend the
same, there is nothing that exacteth either beleefe, or [[obedience]].

for to say that [[god]] hath spoken to him in the holy [[scripture]], is not
to say [[god]] hath spoken to him immediately, but by mediation of the
prophets, or of the [[apostles]], or of the [[church]], in such manner as he
speaks to all other [[christian]] [[men]]. to say he hath spoken to him in a
dream, is no more than to say he dreamed that [[god]] spake to him; which is
not of [[force]] to [[win]] beleef from any [[man]], that knows [[know]] dreams [[dream]] are for
the most part naturall, and may proceed from former thoughts [[thought]]; and such
dreams as that, from selfe conceit, and foolish arrogance, and false
opinion of a mans [[man]] own godlinesse, or other vertue, by which he thinks [[think]] he
hath merited the favour of extraordinary revelation. to say he hath
seen a vision, or heard a voice, is to say, that he hath dreamed between
sleeping and waking: for in such manner a [[man]] doth many times [[time]] naturally
take his [[dream]] for a vision, as not having well observed his own
slumbering. to say he speaks by supernaturall inspiration, is to say he
finds an ardent [[desire]] to speak, or some [[strong]] [[opinion]] of himself, for
which he can alledge no naturall and sufficient [[reason]]. so that
though [[god]] almighty can speak to a [[man]], by dreams [[dream]], visions, voice, and
inspiration; yet he obliges no [[man]] to beleeve he hath so done to him
that pretends it; who (being a man), may erre, and (which is more) may
lie.




by what marks prophets [[prophet]] are known

how then can he, to whom [[god]] hath never revealed his wil immediately
(saving by the way of [[natural]] reason) [[know]] when he is to obey, or not
to obey his word, delivered by him, that sayes he is a [[prophet]]? (1 kings
22) of 400 prophets [[prophet]], of whom the k. of [[israel]] [[asked]] counsel, concerning
the warre he made against ramoth gilead, only micaiah was a true one.(1
kings 13) the [[prophet]] that was sent to prophecy against the altar set up
by jeroboam, though a true [[prophet]], and that by two [[miracles]] done in
his presence appears to be a [[prophet]] sent from [[god]], was yet deceived by
another old [[prophet]], that perswaded him as from the mouth of [[god]], to eat
and drink with him. if one [[prophet]] [[deceive]] another, what certainty is
there of knowing the will of [[god]], by other way than that of [[reason]]? to
which i [[answer]] out of the holy [[scripture]], that there be two marks, by
which together, not asunder, a true [[prophet]] is to be known. one is the
doing of [[miracles]]; the other is the not teaching any other [[religion]] than
that which is already established. asunder (i say) neither of these is
sufficient. (deut. 13 v. 1,2,3,4,5 ) "if a [[prophet]] rise amongst you, or
a dreamer of dreams [[dream]], and shall pretend the doing of a miracle, and the
miracle come to passe; if he say, let us [[follow]] [[strange]] gods, which thou
hast not known, thou shalt not hearken to him, &c. but that [[prophet]] and
dreamer of dreams [[dream]] shall be put to [[death]], because he hath spoken to you
to revolt from the [[lord]] your [[god]]." in which words two things are to
be observed, first, that [[god]] wil not have [[miracles]] alone serve for
arguments, to approve the prophets [[prophet]] calling; but (as it is in the third
verse) for an experiment of the constancy of our adherence to himself.
for the works [[work]] of the egyptian sorcerers, though not so [[great]] as those
of [[moses]], yet were [[great]] [[miracles]]. secondly, that how [[great]] soever the
miracle be, yet if it tend to stir up revolt against the [[king]], or him
that governeth by the kings [[king]] [[authority]], he that doth such miracle, is
not to be considered otherwise than as sent to make triall of their
allegiance. for these words, "revolt from the [[lord]] your [[god]]," are in
this place equivalent to "revolt from your [[king]]." for they had made god
their [[king]] by pact at the foot of mount sinai; who ruled them by moses
only; for he only spake with [[god]], and from [[time]] to [[time]] declared gods
commandements to the [[people]]. in like manner, after our saviour christ
had made his disciples acknowledge him for the messiah, (that is to say,
for gods anointed, whom the nation of the [[jews]] daily expected for their
king, but refused when he came,) he omitted not to advertise them of the
danger of [[miracles]]. "there shall arise," (saith he) "false christs, and
false prophets [[prophet]], and shall doe [[great]] wonders and [[miracles]], even to the
seducing (if it were possible) of the very elect." (mat. 24. 24) by
which it appears, that false prophets [[prophet]] may have the [[power]] of [[miracles]];
yet are wee not to take their doctrin for gods word. st. paul says
further to the galatians, that "if himself, or an angell from heaven
preach another gospel to them, than he had preached, let him be
accursed." (gal. 1. 8) that gospel was, that [[christ]] was [[king]]; so that
all preaching against the [[power]] of the [[king]] received, in consequence
to these words, is by st. paul accursed. for his [[speech]] is addressed to
those, who by his preaching had already received [[jesus]] for the [[christ]],
that is to say, for [[king]] of the [[jews]].




the marks of a [[prophet]] in the old [[law]], [[miracles]], and doctrine
conformable to the law

and as [[miracles]], without preaching that doctrine which [[god]] hath
established; so preaching the true doctrine, without the doing of
miracles, is an unsufficient argument of immediate revelation. for if
a [[man]] that teacheth not false doctrine, should pretend to bee a prophet
without shewing any miracle, he is never the more to bee regarded for
his pretence, as is evident by deut. 18. v. 21, 22. "if thou say in
thy [[heart]], how shall we [[know]] that the word (of the prophet) is not that
which the [[lord]] hath spoken. when the [[prophet]] shall have spoken in the
name of the [[lord]], that which shall not come to passe, that’s the word
which the [[lord]] hath not spoken, but the [[prophet]] has spoken it out of
the [[pride]] of his own [[heart]], [[fear]] him not." but a [[man]] may here again ask,
when the [[prophet]] hath foretold a thing, how shal we [[know]] whether it will
come to passe or not? for he may foretel it as a thing to arrive after
a [[certain]] long [[time]], longer then the [[time]] of mans [[man]] [[life]]; or indefinitely,
that it will come to passe one [[time]] or other: in which case this mark
of a [[prophet]] is unusefull; and therefore the [[miracles]] that oblige us to
beleeve a [[prophet]], ought to be confirmed by an immediate, or a not
long deferr’d event. so that it is manifest, that the teaching of
the [[religion]] which [[god]] hath established, and the showing of a present
miracle, joined together, were the only marks whereby the scripture
would have a true [[prophet]], that is to say immediate revelation to be
acknowledged; neither of them being singly sufficient to oblige any
other [[man]] to regard what he saith.




miracles ceasing, prophets [[prophet]] cease, the [[scripture]] supplies their place

seeing therefore [[miracles]] now cease, we have no sign left, whereby to
acknowledge the pretended revelations, or inspirations of any private
man; nor obligation to give ear to any doctrine, farther than it is
conformable to the holy scriptures [[scripture]], which since the [[time]] of our saviour,
supply the want of all other prophecy; and from which, by [[wise]] and
careful ratiocination, all rules [[rule]] and precepts necessary to the knowledge
of our [[duty]] both to [[god]] and [[man]], without enthusiasme, or supernaturall
inspiration, may easily be deduced. and this [[scripture]] is it, out of
which i am to take the principles [[principle]] of my discourse, concerning the
rights of those that are the supream govenors on [[earth]], of christian
common-wealths; and of the [[duty]] of [[christian]] subjects [[subject]] towards their
soveraigns. and to that end, i shall speak in the next [[chapter]], or the
books, writers, scope and [[authority]] of the bible.




chapter xxxiii. of the number, antiquity, scope, [[authority]], and
interpreters of the books [[book]] of holy scripture




of the books [[book]] of holy scripture

by the books [[book]] of holy [[scripture]], are understood those, which ought to be
the canon, that is to say, the rules [[rule]] of [[christian]] [[life]]. and because all
rules of [[life]], which [[men]] are in [[conscience]] bound to observe, are laws [[law]];
the [[question]] of the [[scripture]], is the [[question]] of what is [[law]] throughout
all christendome, both naturall, and civill. for though it be not
determined in [[scripture]], what laws [[law]] every [[christian]] [[king]] shall constitute
in his own dominions; yet it is determined what laws [[law]] he shall not
constitute. seeing therefore i have already proved, that soveraigns
in their own dominions are the sole legislators; those books [[book]] only are
canonicall, that is, [[law]], in every nation, which are established for
such by the soveraign [[authority]]. it is true, that [[god]] is the soveraign
of all soveraigns; and therefore, when he speaks to any [[subject]], he
ought to be obeyed, whatsoever any earthly potentate command to the
contrary. but the [[question]] is not of [[obedience]] to [[god]], but of when,
and what [[god]] hath said; which to subjects [[subject]] that have no supernaturall
revelation, cannot be known, but by that naturall [[reason]], which guided
them, for the obtaining of [[peace]] and [[justice]], to obey the authority
of their severall common-wealths; that is to say, of their lawfull
soveraigns. according to this obligation, i can acknowledge no other
books of the old testament, to be holy [[scripture]], but those which have
been commanded to be acknowledged for such, by the [[authority]] of the
church of [[england]]. what books [[book]] these are, is sufficiently known, without
a catalogue of them here; and they are the same that are acknowledged
by st. jerome, who holdeth the rest, namely, the wisdome of solomon,
ecclesiasticus, judith, tobias, the first and second of maccabees,
(though he had seen the first in hebrew) and the third and fourth of
esdras, for apocrypha. of the canonicall, josephus a learned jew, that
wrote in the [[time]] of the [[emperor]] domitian, reckoneth twenty two, making
the number agree with the [[hebrew]] alphabet. st. jerome does the same,
though they reckon them in different manner. for josephus numbers five
books of [[moses]], thirteen of prophets [[prophet]], that writ the [[history]] of their own
times (which how it agrees with the prophets [[prophet]] writings contained in the
bible wee shall see hereafter), and four of hymnes and morall precepts.
but st. jerome reckons five books [[book]] of [[moses]], eight of prophets [[prophet]], and nine
of other holy writ, which he calls of hagiographa. the septuagint, who
were 70. learned [[men]] of the [[jews]], sent for by ptolemy [[king]] of [[egypt]], to
translate the jewish [[law]], out of the [[hebrew]] into the [[greek]], have left us
no other for holy [[scripture]] in the [[greek]] tongue, but the same that are
received in the [[church]] of [[england]].

as for the books [[book]] of the new testament, they are equally acknowledged for
canon by all [[christian]] churches [[church]], and by all sects of christians [[christian]], that
admit any books [[book]] at all for canonicall.




their antiquity

who were the originall writers of the severall books [[book]] of holy [[scripture]],
has not been made evident by any sufficient testimony of other [[history]],
(which is the only proof of matter of fact); nor can be by any arguments
of naturall [[reason]]; for [[reason]] serves only to convince the [[truth]] (not
of [[fact]], but) of consequence. the [[light]] therefore that must guide us in
this [[question]], must be that which is held out unto us from the bookes
themselves: and this [[light]], though it show us not the writer of every
book, yet it is not unusefull to give us [[knowledge]] of the [[time]], wherein
they were written.




the pentateuch not written by moses

and first, for the pentateuch, it is not argument enough that they were
written by [[moses]], because they are called the five books [[book]] of [[moses]]; no
more than these titles, the [[book]] of joshua, the [[book]] of judges [[judge]], the book
of ruth, and the books [[book]] of the kings [[king]], are arguments sufficient to prove,
that they were written by joshua, by the judges [[judge]], by ruth, and by the
kings. for in titles of books [[book]], the [[subject]] is marked, as often as the
writer. the [[history]] of livy, denotes the writer; but the [[history]] of
scanderbeg, is denominated from the [[subject]]. we [[read]] in the [[last]] chapter
of deuteronomie, ver. 6. concerning the sepulcher of [[moses]], "that no man
knoweth of his sepulcher to this day," that is, to the day wherein those
words were written. it is therefore manifest, that those words were
written after his interrement. for it were a [[strange]] interpretation, to
say [[moses]] spake of his own sepulcher (though by prophecy), that it was
not found to that day, wherein he was yet living. but it may perhaps
be alledged, that the [[last]] [[chapter]] only, not the whole pentateuch, was
written by some other [[man]], but the rest not: let us therefore consider
that which we find in the [[book]] of genesis, chap. 12. ver. 6 "and abraham
passed through the [[land]] to the place of sichem, unto the plain of moreh,
and the canaanite was then in the [[land]];" which must needs bee the
words of one that wrote when the canaanite was not in the [[land]]; and
consequently, not of [[moses]], who dyed before he came into it. likewise
numbers 21. ver. 14. the writer citeth another more ancient [[book]],
entituled, the [[book]] of the warres of the [[lord]], wherein were registred
the acts of [[moses]], at the red-sea, and at the brook of arnon. it is
therefore sufficiently evident, that the five books [[book]] of [[moses]] were
written after his [[time]], though how long after it be not so manifest.

but though [[moses]] did not compile those books [[book]] entirely, and in the form
we have them; yet he wrote all that which hee is there said to have
written: as for [[example]], the volume of the [[law]], which is contained, as
it seemeth in the 11 of deuteronomie, and the following chapters [[chapter]] to the
27. which was also commanded to be written on stones, in their entry
into the [[land]] of canaan. (deut. 31. 9) and this did [[moses]] himself
write, and deliver to the priests [[priest]] and elders of [[israel]], to be read
every seventh year to all [[israel]], at their assembling in the feast of
tabernacles. and this is that [[law]] which [[god]] commanded, that their kings
(when they should have established that form of government) should take
a copy of from the priests [[priest]] and levites to lay in the side of the arke;
(deut. 31. 26) and the same which having been lost, was long [[time]] after
found again by hilkiah, and sent to [[king]] josias, who causing it to be
read to the [[people]], renewed the covenant between [[god]] and them. (2 [[king]].
22. 8 & 23. 1,2,3)




the [[book]] of joshua written after his time

that the [[book]] of joshua was also written long after the [[time]] of joshua,
may be gathered out of many places of the [[book]] it [[self]]. joshua had
set up twelve stones in the middest of jordan, for a monument of their
passage; (josh 4. 9) of which the writer saith thus, "they are there
unto this day;" (josh 5. 9) for "unto this day", is a phrase that
signifieth a [[time]] [[past]], beyond the memory of [[man]]. in like manner, upon
the saying of the [[lord]], that he had rolled off from the [[people]] the
reproach of [[egypt]], the writer saith, "the place is called gilgal unto
this day;" which to have said in the [[time]] of joshua had been improper.
so also the name of the valley of achor, from the trouble that achan
raised in the camp, (josh. 7. 26) the writer saith, "remaineth unto
this day;" which must needs bee therefore long after the [[time]] of joshua.
arguments of this [[kind]] there be many other; as josh. 8. 29. 13. 13. 14.
14. 15. 63.




the booke of judges [[judge]] and ruth written long after the captivity

the same is manifest by like arguments of the [[book]] of judges [[judge]], chap. 1.
21,26 6.24 10.4 15.19 17.6 and ruth 1. 1. but especially judg. 18. 30.
where it is said, that jonathan "and his sonnes were priests [[priest]] to the
tribe of dan, untill the day of the captivity of the [[land]]."




the like of the bookes of samuel

that the books [[book]] of samuel were also written after his own [[time]], there
are the like arguments, 1 sam. 5.5. 7.13,15. 27.6. & 30.25. where, after
david had adjudged equall part of the spoiles, to them that guarded
the ammunition, with them that fought, the writer saith, "he made it a
statute and an ordinance to [[israel]] to this day." (2. sam. 6.4.) again,
when [[david]] (displeased, that the [[lord]] had slain uzzah, for putting out
his hand to sustain the ark,) called the place perez-uzzah, the writer
saith, it is called so "to this day": the [[time]] therefore of the writing
of that [[book]], must be long after the [[time]] of the [[fact]]; that is, long
after the [[time]] of [[david]].




the books [[book]] of the kings [[king]], and the chronicles

as for the two books [[book]] of the kings [[king]], and the two books [[book]] of the chronicles,
besides the places which mention such monuments, as the writer saith,
remained till his own days; such as are 1 kings [[king]] 9.13. 9.21. 10. 12.
12.19. 2 kings [[king]] 2.22. 8.22. 10.27. 14.7. 16.6. 17.23. 17.34. 17.41. 1
chron. 4.41. 5.26. it is argument sufficient they were written after the
captivity in [[babylon]], that the [[history]] of them is continued till that
time. for the facts [[fact]] registred are alwaies more ancient than such books
as make mention of, and quote the register; as these books [[book]] doe in divers
places, referring the reader to the chronicles of the kings [[king]] of juda,
to the chronicles of the kings [[king]] of [[israel]], to the books [[book]] of the prophet
samuel, or the [[prophet]] nathan, of the [[prophet]] ahijah; to the vision of
jehdo, to the books [[book]] of the [[prophet]] serveiah, and of the [[prophet]] addo.




ezra and nehemiah

the books [[book]] of esdras and nehemiah were written certainly after their
return from captivity; because their return, the re-edification of
the walls and houses of [[jerusalem]], the renovation of the covenant, and
ordination of their policy are therein contained.




esther

the [[history]] of queen esther is of the [[time]] of the captivity; and
therefore the writer must have been of the same [[time]], or after it.




job

the [[book]] of [[job]] hath no mark in it of the [[time]] wherein it was written:
and though it appear sufficiently (exekiel 14.14, and james 5.11.)
that he was no fained [[person]]; yet the [[book]] it [[self]] seemeth not to be
a [[history]], but a treatise concerning a [[question]] in ancient [[time]] much
disputed, "why wicked [[men]] have often prospered in this [[world]], and good
men have been afflicted;" and it is the most probably, because from the
beginning, to the third verse of the third [[chapter]], where the complaint
of [[job]] beginneth, the [[hebrew]] is (as st. jerome testifies) in prose; and
from thence to the sixt verse of the [[last]] [[chapter]] in hexameter verses;
and the rest of that [[chapter]] again in prose. so that the dispute is all
in verse; and the prose is added, but as a preface in the beginning, and
an epilogue in the end. but verse is no usuall stile of such, as either
are themselves in [[great]] [[pain]], as [[job]]; or of such as come to comfort
them, as his [[friends]]; but in [[philosophy]], especially morall [[philosophy]],
in ancient [[time]] frequent.




the psalter

the psalmes were written the most part by [[david]], for the use of the
quire. to these are added some songs [[song]] of [[moses]], and other holy [[men]]; and
some of them after the return from the captivity; as the 137. and the
126. whereby it is manifest that the psalter was compiled, and put into
the form it now hath, after the return of the [[jews]] from [[babylon]].




the proverbs

the proverbs, being a collection of [[wise]] and godly sayings, partly of
solomon, partly of agur the [[son]] of jakeh; and partly of the mother
of [[king]] lemuel, cannot probably be [[thought]] to have been collected by
solomon, rather then by agur, or the [[mother]] of lemues; and that, though
the sentences be theirs, yet the collection or compiling them into this
one [[book]], was the [[work]] of some other godly [[man]], that lived after them
all.




ecclesiastes and the canticles

the books [[book]] of ecclesiastes and the canticles have nothing that was not
solomons, except it be the titles, or inscriptions. for "the words of
the preacher, the [[son]] of [[david]], [[king]] in [[jerusalem]];" and, "the [[song]] of
songs, which is solomon’s," seem to have been made for distinctions
sake, then, when the books [[book]] of [[scripture]] were gathered into one [[body]] of
the [[law]]; to the end, that not the doctrine only, but the authors also
might be extant.




the prophets

of the prophets [[prophet]], the most ancient, are sophoniah, jonas, amos, hosea,
isaiah and michaiah, who lived in the [[time]] of amaziah, and azariah,
otherwise ozias, kings [[king]] of judah. but the [[book]] of jonas is not properly
a register of his prophecy, (for that is contained in these few words,
"fourty dayes and ninivy shall be destroyed,") but a [[history]] or narration
of his frowardenesse and disputing gods commandements; so that there is
small probability he should be the author, seeing he is the [[subject]] of
it. but the [[book]] of amos is his prophecy.

jeremiah, abdias, nahum, and habakkuk prophecyed in the [[time]] of josiah.

ezekiel, daniel, aggeus, and zacharias, in the captivity.

when joel and malachi prophecyed, is not evident by their writings. but
considering the inscriptions, or titles of their books [[book]], it is manifest
enough, that the whole [[scripture]] of the old testament, was set forth in
the form we have it, after the return of the [[jews]] from their captivity
in [[babylon]], and before the [[time]] of ptolemaeus philadelphus, that caused
it to bee translated into [[greek]] by seventy [[men]], which were sent him
out of judea for that [[purpose]]. and if the books [[book]] of apocrypha (which
are recommended to us by the [[church]], though not for canonicall, yet for
profitable books [[book]] for our instruction) may in this point be credited, the
scripture was set forth in the form wee have it in, by esdras; as may
appear by that which he himself saith, in the second [[book]], chapt. 14.
verse 21, 22, &c. where speaking to [[god]], he saith thus, "thy [[law]] is
burnt; therefore no [[man]] knoweth the things which thou has done, or the
works that are to begin. but if i have found grace before thee, send
down the holy spirit into me, and i shall write all that hath been done
in the [[world]], since the beginning, which were written in thy [[law]], that
men may find thy path, and that they which will [[live]] in the later days,
may [[live]]." and verse 45. "and it came to passe when the forty dayes were
fulfilled, that the highest spake, saying, ‘the first that thou hast
written, publish openly, that the worthy and unworthy may [[read]] it; but
keep the seventy [[last]], that thou mayst deliver them onely to such as
be [[wise]] among the [[people]].’" and thus much concerning the [[time]] of the
writing of the bookes of the old testament.




the new testament

the writers of the new testament lived all in lesse then an [[age]] after
christs ascension, and had all of them seen our saviour, or been his
disciples, except st. paul, and st. luke; and consequently whatsoever
was written by them, is as ancient as the [[time]] of the [[apostles]]. but
the [[time]] wherein the books [[book]] of the new testament were received, and
acknowledged by the [[church]] to be of their writing, is not altogether so
ancient. for, as the bookes of the old testament are derived to us, from
no higher [[time]] then that of esdras, who by the direction of gods spirit
retrived them, when they were lost: those of the new testament, of which
the copies were not many, nor could easily be all in any one private
mans hand, cannot bee derived from a higher [[time]], that that wherein the
governours of the [[church]] collected, approved, and recommended them to
us, as the writings of those [[apostles]] and disciples; under whose names
they go. the first enumeration of all the bookes, both of the old,
and new testament, is in the canons of the [[apostles]], supposed to be
collected by clement the first (after st. peter) bishop of [[rome]]. but
because that is but supposed, and by many questioned, the councell of
laodicea is the first we [[know]], that recommended the bible to the then
christian churches [[church]], for the writings of the prophets [[prophet]] and [[apostles]]: and
this councell was held in the 364. yeer after [[christ]]. at which [[time]],
though [[ambition]] had so far prevailed on the [[great]] doctors of the [[church]],
as no more to esteem emperours, though [[christian]], for the shepherds of
the [[people]], but for sheep; and emperours not [[christian]], for wolves; and
endeavoured to passe their doctrine, not for counsell, and information,
as preachers; but for laws [[law]], as absolute governours; and [[thought]] such
frauds as tended to make the [[people]] the more [[obedient]] to christian
doctrine, to be pious; yet i am perswaded they did not therefore
falsifie the scriptures [[scripture]], though the copies of the books [[book]] of the new
testament, were in the hands only of the ecclesiasticks; because if they
had had an intention so to doe, they would surely have made them more
favorable to their [[power]] over [[christian]] princes [[prince]], and civill soveraignty,
than they are. i see not therefore any [[reason]] to [[doubt]], but that the
old, and new testament, as we have them now, are the true registers of
those things, which were done and said by the prophets [[prophet]], and [[apostles]].
and so perhaps are some of those books [[book]] which are called apocrypha, if
left out of the canon, not for inconformity of doctrine with the
rest, but only because they are not found in the [[hebrew]]. for after the
conquest of [[asia]] by alexander the [[great]], there were few learned [[jews]],
that were not [[perfect]] in the [[greek]] tongue. for the seventy interpreters
that converted the bible into [[greek]], were all of them hebrews; and we
have extant the works [[work]] of philo and josephus both [[jews]], written by them
eloquently in [[greek]]. but it is not the writer, but the [[authority]] of the
church, that maketh a [[book]] canonicall.




their scope

and although these books [[book]] were written by divers [[men]], yet it is manifest
the writers were all indued with one and the same spirit, in that they
conspire to one and the same end, which is the setting forth of the
rights of the kingdome of [[god]], the [[father]], [[son]], and holy ghost. for
the [[book]] of genesis, deriveth the genealogy of gods [[people]], from the
creation of the [[world]], to the going into [[egypt]]: the other four books [[book]] of
moses, contain the election of [[god]] for their [[king]], and the laws [[law]] which
hee prescribed for their [[government]]: the books [[book]] of joshua, judges [[judge]], ruth,
and samuel, to the [[time]] of saul, describe the acts of gods [[people]],
till the [[time]] they cast off gods yoke, and called for a [[king]], after the
manner of their neighbour nations; the rest of the [[history]] of the
old testament, derives the succession of the line of [[david]], to the
captivity, out of which line was to spring the restorer of the kingdome
of [[god]], even our blessed saviour [[god]] the [[son]], whose coming was foretold
in the bookes of the prophets [[prophet]], after whom the evangelists writt his
life, and actions, and his claim to the kingdome, whilst he lived one
earth: and lastly, the acts, and epistles of the [[apostles]], declare the
coming of [[god]], the holy ghost, and the [[authority]] he left with them, and
their successors, for the direction of the [[jews]], and for the invitation
of the gentiles. in summe, the histories [[history]] and the prophecies of the old
testament, and the gospels, and epistles of the new testament, have had
one and the same scope, to convert [[men]] to the [[obedience]] of [[god]]; 1. in
moses, and the priests [[priest]]; 2. in the [[man]] [[christ]]; and 3. in the [[apostles]] and
the successors to apostolicall [[power]]. for these three at several times
did represent the [[person]] of [[god]]: [[moses]], and his successors the high
priests, and kings [[king]] of judah, in the old testament: [[christ]] himself, in
the [[time]] he lived on [[earth]]: and the [[apostles]], and their successors, from
the day of pentecost (when the holy ghost descended on them) to this
day.




the [[question]] of the [[authority]] of the scriptures [[scripture]] stated.

it is a [[question]] much disputed between the divers sects of christian
religion, from whence the scriptures [[scripture]] derive their [[authority]]; which
question is also propounded sometimes in other terms, as, how wee know
them to be the word of [[god]], or, why we beleeve them to be so: and the
difficulty of resolving it, ariseth chiefly from the impropernesse of
the words wherein the [[question]] it [[self]] is couched. for it is beleeved
on all hands, that the first and originall author of them is [[god]]; and
consequently the [[question]] disputed, is not that. again, it is manifest,
that none can [[know]] they are gods word, (though all true christians
beleeve it,) but those to whom [[god]] himself hath revealed it
supernaturally; and therefore the [[question]] is not rightly moved, of our
knowledge of it. lastly, when the [[question]] is propounded of our beleefe;
because some are moved to beleeve for one, and others for other reasons [[reason]],
there can be rendred no one generall [[answer]] for them all. the question
truly stated is, by what [[authority]] they are made [[law]].




their [[authority]] and interpretation

as far as they differ not from the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], there is no [[doubt]],
but they are the [[law]] of [[god]], and carry their [[authority]] with them,
legible to all [[men]] that have the use of naturall [[reason]]: but this is
no other [[authority]], then that of all other morall doctrine consonant to
reason; the dictates whereof are laws [[law]], not made, but eternall.

if they be made [[law]] by [[god]] himselfe, they are of the [[nature]] of written
law, which are laws [[law]] to them only to whom [[god]] hath so sufficiently
published them, as no [[man]] can excuse himself, by saying, he [[know]] not
they were his.

he therefore, to whom [[god]] hath not supernaturally revealed, that they
are his, nor that those that published them, were sent by him, is not
obliged to obey them, by any [[authority]], but his, whose commands have
already the [[force]] of laws [[law]]; that is to say, by any other [[authority]], then
that of the common-wealth, residing in the soveraign, who only has the
legislative [[power]]. again, if it be not the legislative [[authority]] of
the common-wealth, that giveth them the [[force]] of laws [[law]], it must bee
some other [[authority]] derived from [[god]], either private, or publique:
if private, it obliges onely him, to whom in particular [[god]] hath been
pleased to reveale it. for if every [[man]] should be obliged, to take for
gods [[law]], what particular [[men]], on pretence of private inspiration, or
revelation, should obtrude upon him, (in such a number of [[men]], that out
of [[pride]], and ignorance, take their own dreams [[dream]], and extravagant fancies,
and madnesse, for testimonies of gods spirit; or out of [[ambition]],
pretend to such [[divine]] testimonies, falsely, and contrary to their
own consciences,) it were impossible that any [[divine]] [[law]] should be
acknowledged. if publique, it is the [[authority]] of the common-wealth, or
of the [[church]]. but the [[church]], if it be one [[person]], is the same thing
with a common-wealth of christians [[christian]]; called a common-wealth, because it
consisteth of [[men]] [[united]] in one [[person]], their soveraign; and a [[church]],
because it consisteth in [[christian]] [[men]], [[united]] in one christian
soveraign. but if the [[church]] be not one [[person]], then it hath no
authority at all; it can neither command, nor doe any action at all; nor
is capable of having any [[power]], or [[right]] to any thing; nor has any will,
reason, nor voice; for all these qualities are personall. now if the
whole number of christians [[christian]] be not contained in one common-wealth, they
are not one [[person]]; nor is there an universall [[church]] that hath any
authority over them; and therefore the scriptures [[scripture]] are not made laws [[law]],
by the universall [[church]]: or if it bee one common-wealth, then all
christian monarchs, and states are private persons [[person]], and [[subject]] to
bee judged, deposed, and punished by an universall soveraigne of all
christendome. so that the [[question]] of the [[authority]] of the scriptures [[scripture]] is
reduced to this, "whether [[christian]] kings [[king]], and the soveraigne assemblies
in [[christian]] common-wealths, be absolute in their own territories,
immediately under [[god]]; or [[subject]] to one vicar of [[christ]], constituted
over the universall [[church]]; to bee judged, condemned, deposed, and put
to [[death]], as hee shall [[think]] expedient, or necessary for the common
good."

which [[question]] cannot bee resolved, without a more particular
consideration of the kingdome of [[god]]; from whence also, wee are to judge
of the [[authority]] of interpreting the [[scripture]]. for, whosoever hath a
lawfull [[power]] over any writing, to make it [[law]], hath the [[power]] also to
approve, or disapprove the interpretation of the same.



chapter xxxiv. of the signification of spirit, angel, and inspiration in
the books [[book]] of holy scripture




body and spirit how taken in the scripture

seeing the foundation of all true ratiocination, is the constant
signification of words; which in the doctrine following, dependeth not
(as in naturall science) on the will of the writer, nor (as in common
conversation) on vulgar use, but on the sense they carry in the
scripture; it is necessary, before i proceed any further, to determine,
out of the bible, the meaning of such words, as by their ambiguity, may
render what i am to inferre upon them, obscure, or disputable. i will
begin with the words [[body]], and spirit, which in the [[language]] of the
schools are termed, substances, corporeall, and incorporeall.

the word [[body]], in the most generall acceptation, signifieth that
which filleth, or occupyeth some [[certain]] room, or imagined place; and
dependeth not on the [[imagination]], but is a reall part of that we call
the [[universe]]. for the [[universe]], being the aggregate of all bodies [[body]], there
is no reall part thereof that is not also [[body]]; nor any thing properly
a [[body]], that is not also part of (that aggregate of all bodies) the
universe. the same also, because bodies [[body]] are [[subject]] to [[change]], that is
to say, to variety of apparence to the sense of living creatures, is
called substance, that is to say, [[subject]], to various accidents, as
sometimes to be moved, sometimes to stand still; and to seem to our
senses sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes of one colour, smel,
tast, or sound, somtimes of another. and this [[diversity]] of seeming,
(produced by the [[diversity]] of the operation of bodies [[body]], on the organs
of our sense) we attribute to alterations of the bodies [[body]] that operate, &
call them accidents of those bodies [[body]]. and according to this acceptation
of the word, substance and [[body]], signifie the same thing; and therefore
substance incorporeall are words, which when they are joined together,
destroy one another, as if a [[man]] should say, an incorporeall [[body]].

but in the sense of [[common]] [[people]], not all the [[universe]] is called [[body]],
but only such parts thereof as they can discern by the sense of feeling,
to resist their [[force]], or by the sense of their [[eyes]], to hinder them
from a farther prospect. therefore in the [[common]] [[language]] of [[men]], aire,
and aeriall substances, use not to be taken for bodies [[body]], but (as often
as [[men]] are sensible of their effects) are called wind, or breath, or
(because the some are called in the latine spiritus) spirits; as when
they call that aeriall substance, which in the [[body]] of any living
creature, gives it [[life]] and motion, vitall and animall spirits. but for
those idols of the brain, which represent bodies [[body]] to us, where they
are not, as in a looking-glasse, in a [[dream]], or to a distempered brain
waking, they are (as the apostle saith generally of all idols) nothing;
nothing at all, i say, there where they seem to bee; and in the brain
it [[self]], nothing but tumult, proceeding either from the action of the
objects, or from the disorderly agitation of the organs of our sense.
and [[men]], that are otherwise imployed, then to search into their causes,
know not of themselves, what to call them; and may therefore easily be
perswaded, by those whose [[knowledge]] they much reverence, some to
call them bodies [[body]], and [[think]] them made of aire compacted by a power
supernaturall, because the sight judges [[judge]] them corporeall; and some to
call them spirits, because the sense of touch discerneth nothing in the
place where they appear, to resist their fingers: so that the proper
signification of spirit in [[common]] [[speech]], is either a subtile, fluid,
and invisible [[body]], or a ghost, or other idol or phantasme of the
imagination. but for metaphoricall significations, there be many: for
sometimes it is taken for disposition or inclination of the [[mind]]; as
when for the disposition to controwl the sayings of other [[men]], we say,
a spirit contradiction; for a disposition to uncleannesse, an unclean
spirit; for perversenesse, a froward spirit; for sullennesse, a dumb
spirit, and for inclination to godlinesse, and gods service, the spirit
of [[god]]: sometimes for any eminent ability, or extraordinary passion,
or disease of the [[mind]], as when [[great]] wisdome is called the spirit of
wisdome; and mad [[men]] are said to be possessed with a spirit.

other signification of spirit i find no where any; and where none
of these can satisfie the sense of that word in [[scripture]], the place
falleth not under humane understanding; and our [[faith]] therein consisteth
not in our [[opinion]], but in our submission; as in all places where god
is said to be a spirit; or where by the spirit of [[god]], is meant god
himselfe. for the [[nature]] of [[god]] is incomprehensible; that is to say, we
understand nothing of what he is, but only that he is; and therefore the
attributes we give him, are not to tell one another, what he is, nor
to signifie our [[opinion]] of his [[nature]], but our [[desire]] to [[honor]] him with
such names as we conceive most honorable amongst our selves.




spirit of [[god]] taken in the [[scripture]] sometimes for a wind, or breath

gen. 1. 2. "the spirit of [[god]] moved upon the face of the waters." here
if by the spirit of [[god]] be meant [[god]] himself, then is motion attributed
to [[god]], and consequently place, which are intelligible only of bodies [[body]],
and not of substances incorporeall; and so the place is above our
understanding, that can conceive nothing moved that changes [[change]] not place,
or that has not dimension; and whatsoever has dimension, is [[body]]. but
the meaning of those words is [[best]] understood by the like place, gen.
8. 1. where when the [[earth]] was covered with waters, as in the beginning,
god intending to abate them, and again to discover the dry [[land]], useth
like words, "i will bring my spirit upon the [[earth]], and the waters shall
be diminished:" in which place by spirit is understood a wind, (that is
an aire or spirit moved,) which might be called (as in the former place)
the spirit of [[god]], because it was gods [[work]].




secondly, for extraordinary gifts of the understanding

gen. 41. 38. pharaoh calleth the wisdome of joseph, the spirit of [[god]].
for joseph having advised him to look out a [[wise]] and discreet [[man]], and
to set him over the [[land]] of [[egypt]], he saith thus, "can we find such a
man as this is, in whom is the spirit of [[god]]?" and exod. 28.3. "thou
shalt speak (saith god) to all that are [[wise]] hearted, whom i have filled
with the spirit of wisdome, to make aaron garments, to consecrate him."
where extraordinary understanding, though but in making garments, as
being the gift of [[god]], is called the spirit of [[god]]. the same is found
again, exod. 31.3,4,5,6. and 35.31. and isaiah 11.2,3. where the prophet
speaking of the messiah, saith, "the spirit of the [[lord]] shall abide upon
him, the spirit of wisdome and understanding, the spirit of counsell,
and fortitude; and the spirit of the [[fear]] of the [[lord]]." where manifestly
is meant, not so many ghosts, but so many eminent graces that [[god]] would
give him.




thirdly, for extraordinary affections

in the [[book]] of judges [[judge]], an extraordinary zeal, and [[courage]] in the
defence of gods [[people]], is called the spirit of [[god]]; as when it excited
othoniel, gideon, jeptha, and samson to deliver them from servitude,
judg. 3.10. 6.34. 11.29. 13.25. 14.6,19. and of saul, upon the newes of
the insolence of the ammonites towards the [[men]] of jabeth gilead, it is
said (1 sam.11.6.) that "the spirit of [[god]] came upon saul, and his anger
(or, as it is in the latine, his fury) was kindled greatly." where it is
not probable was meant a ghost, but an extraordinary zeal to punish the
cruelty of the ammonites. in like manner by the spirit of [[god]], that came
upon saul, when hee was amongst the prophets [[prophet]] that praised [[god]] in songs [[song]],
and musick (1 sam.19.20.) is to be understood, not a ghost, but an
unexpected and sudden zeal to join with them in their devotions.




fourthly, for the gift of prediction by dreams [[dream]] and visions

the false [[prophet]] zedekiah, saith to micaiah (1 kings [[king]] 22.24.) "which way
went the spirit of the [[lord]] from me to speak to thee?" which cannot be
understood of a ghost; for micaiah declared before the kings [[king]] of israel
and judah, the event of the [[battle]], as from a vision, and not as from a
spirit, speaking in him.

in the same manner it appeareth, in the books [[book]] of the prophets [[prophet]], that
though they spake by the spirit of [[god]], that is to say, by a speciall
grace of prediction; yet their [[knowledge]] of the future, was not by a
ghost within them, but by some supernaturall [[dream]] or vision.




fiftly, for life

gen. 2.7. it is said, "god made [[man]] of the dust of the [[earth]], and
breathed into his nostrills (spiraculum vitae) the breath of [[life]], and
man was made a living [[soul]]." there the breath of [[life]] inspired by [[god]],
signifies no more, but that [[god]] gave him [[life]]; and (job 27.3.) "as long
as the spirit of [[god]] is in my nostrils;" is no more then to say, "as
long as i [[live]]." so in ezek. 1.20. "the spirit of [[life]] was in the
wheels," is equivalent to, "the wheels were alive." and (ezek. 2.30.)
"the spirit entred into me, and set me on my feet," that is, "i
recovered my vitall [[strength]];" not that any ghost, or incorporeal
substance entred into, and possessed his [[body]].




sixtly, for a subordination to authority

in the 11 chap. of numbers. verse 17. "i will take (saith god) of the
spirit, which is upon thee, and will put it upon them, and they shall
bear the burthen of the [[people]] with thee;" that is, upon the seventy
elders: whereupon two of the seventy are said to prophecy in the campe;
of whom some complained, and joshua [[desired]] [[moses]] to forbid them; which
moses would not doe. whereby it appears; that joshua knew not they had
received [[authority]] so to do, and prophecyed according to the [[mind]] of
moses, that is to say, by a spirit, or [[authority]] subordinate to his own.

in the like sense we [[read]] (deut. 34.9.) that "joshua was full of the
spirit of wisdome," because [[moses]] had laid his hands upon him: that is,
because he was ordained by [[moses]], to prosecute the [[work]] hee had himselfe
begun, (namely, the bringing of gods [[people]] into the promised land), but
prevented by [[death]], could not finish.

in the like sense it is said, (rom. 8.9.) "if any [[man]] have not the
spirit of [[christ]], he is none of his:" not meaning thereby the ghost of
christ, but a submission to his doctrine. as also (1 john 4.2.) "hereby
you shall [[know]] the spirit of [[god]]; every spirit that confesseth that
jesus [[christ]] is come in the flesh, is of [[god]];" by which is meant the
spirit of unfained [[christianity]], or submission to that main article of
christian [[faith]], that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]]; which cannot be interpreted
of a ghost.

likewise these words (luke 4.1.) "and [[jesus]] full of the holy ghost"
(that is, as it is exprest, mat. 4.1. and mar. 1.12. "of the holy
spirit",) may be understood, for zeal to doe the [[work]] for which hee was
sent by [[god]] the [[father]]: but to interpret it of a ghost, is to say, that
god himselfe (for so our saviour was,) was filled with [[god]]; which is
very unproper, and unsignificant. how we came to translate spirits, by
the word ghosts, which signifieth nothing, neither in [[heaven]], nor [[earth]],
but the imaginary inhabitants of mans [[man]] brain, i examine not: but this i
say, the word spirit in the text signifieth no such thing; but either
properly a reall substance, or metaphorically, some extraordinary
ability of affection of the [[mind]], or of the [[body]].




seventhly, for aeriall bodies

the disciples of [[christ]], seeing him walking upon the sea, (mat. 14.26.
and marke 6.49.) supposed him to be a spirit, meaning thereby an aeriall
body, and not a phantasme: for it is said, they all saw him; which
cannot be understood of the delusions of the brain, (which are not
common to many at once, as visible bodies [[body]] are; but singular, because of
the differences of fancies), but of bodies [[body]] only. in like manner, where
he was taken for a spirit, by the same [[apostles]] (luke 24.3,7.): so also
(acts 12.15) when st. peter was delivered out of prison, it would not
be beleeved; but when the maid said he was at the dore, they said it
was his angel; by which must be meant a corporeall substance, or we must
say, the disciples themselves did [[follow]] the [[common]] [[opinion]] of both jews
and gentiles, that some such apparitions were not imaginary, but reall;
and such as needed not the fancy of [[man]] for their existence: these the
jews called spirits, and angels, [[good]] or [[bad]]; as the greeks [[greek]] called the
same by the name of daemons. and some such apparitions may be reall, and
substantiall; that is to say, subtile bodies [[body]], which [[god]] can form by
the same [[power]], by which he formed all things, and make use of, as of
ministers, and messengers (that is to say, angels) to declare his
will, and execute the same when he pleaseth, in extraordinary and
supernaturall manner. but when hee hath so formed them they are
substances, endued with dimensions, and take up roome, and can be moved
from place to place, which is peculiar to bodies [[body]]; and therefore are not
ghosts incorporeall, that is to say, ghosts that are in no place;
that is to say, that are no where; that is to say, that seeming to be
somewhat, are nothing. but if corporeall be taken in the most vulgar
manner, for such substances as are perceptible by our externall senses;
then is substance incorporeall, a thing not imaginary, but reall;
namely, a thin substance invisible, but that hath the same dimensions
that are in grosser bodies [[body]].




angel what

by the name of angel, is signified generally, a messenger; and most
often, a messenger of [[god]]: and by a messenger of [[god]], is signified, any
thing that makes known his extraordinary presence; that is to say, the
extraordinary manifestation of his [[power]], especially by a [[dream]], or
vision.

concerning the creation of angels, there is nothing delivered in the
scriptures. that they are spirits, is often repeated: but by the name of
spirit, is signified both in [[scripture]], and vulgarly, both amongst [[jews]],
and gentiles, sometimes thin bodies [[body]]; as the aire, the wind, the spirits
vitall, and animall, of living creatures; and sometimes the images
that rise in the fancy in dreams [[dream]], and visions; which are not reall
substances, but accidents of the brain; yet when [[god]] raiseth them
supernaturally, to signifie his will, they are not unproperly termed
gods messengers, that is to say, his angels.

and as the gentiles did vulgarly conceive the imagery of the brain, for
things really subsistent without them, and not dependent on the fancy;
and out of them framed their opinions [[opinion]] of daemons, [[good]] and evill; which
because they seemed to subsist really, they called substances; and
because they could not [[feel]] them with their hands, incorporeall: so also
the [[jews]] upon the same ground, without any thing in the old testament
that constrained them thereunto, had generally an [[opinion]], (except the
sect of the sadduces,) that those apparitions (which it pleased god
sometimes to [[produce]] in the fancie of [[men]], for his own service, and
therefore called them his angels) were substances, not dependent on the
fancy, but permanent creatures of [[god]]; whereof those which they thought
were [[good]] to them, they esteemed the angels of [[god]], and those they
thought would hurt them, they called evill angels, or evill spirits;
such as was the spirit of python, and the spirits of mad-men, of
lunatiques, and epileptiques: for they esteemed such as were troubled
with such diseases, daemoniaques.

but if we consider the places of the old testament where angels are
mentioned, we shall find, that in most of them, there can nothing else
be understood by the word angel, but some image raised (supernaturally)
in the fancy, to signifie the presence of [[god]] in the execution of some
supernaturall [[work]]; and therefore in the rest, where their [[nature]] is not
exprest, it may be understood in the same manner.

for we [[read]] gen. 16. that the same apparition is called, not onely an
angel, but [[god]]; where that which (verse 7.) is called the angel of
the [[lord]], in the tenth verse, saith to agar, "i will multiply thy seed
exceedingly;" that is, speaketh in the [[person]] of [[god]]. neither was this
apparition a fancy figured, but a voice. by which it is manifest,
that angel signifieth there, nothing but [[god]] himself, that caused agar
supernaturally to apprehend a voice supernaturall, testifying gods
speciall presence there. why therefore may not the angels that appeared
to lot, and are called gen. 19.13. [[men]]; and to whom, though they were
but two, lot speaketh (ver. 18.) as but one, and that one, as [[god]], (for
the words are, "lot said unto them, oh not so my lord") be understood of
images of [[men]], supernaturally formed in the fancy; as well as before by
angel was understood a fancyed voice? when the angel called to abraham
out of [[heaven]], to stay his hand (gen. 22.11.) from slaying isaac, there
was no apparition, but a voice; which neverthelesse was called properly
enough a messenger, or angel of [[god]], because it declared gods will
supernaturally, and saves the [[labour]] of supposing any permanent ghosts.
the angels which jacob saw on the ladder of [[heaven]] (gen. 28.12.) were
a vision of his sleep; therefore onely fancy, and a [[dream]]; yet being
supernaturall, and signs of gods speciall presence, those apparitions
are not improperly called angels. the same is to be understood
(gen.31.11.) where jacob saith thus, "the angel of the [[lord]] appeared to
mee in my sleep." for an apparition made to a [[man]] in his sleep, is
that which all [[men]] call a dreame, whether such dreame be naturall, or
supernaturall: and that which there jacob calleth an angel, was god
himselfe; for the same angel saith (verse 13.) "i am the [[god]] of bethel."

also (exod.14.9.) the angel that went before the [[army]] of [[israel]] to the
red sea, and then came behind it, is (verse 19.) the [[lord]] himself; and
he appeared not in the form of a beautifull [[man]], but in form (by day)
of a pillar of cloud and (by night) in form of a pillar of [[fire]]; and yet
this pillar was all the apparition, and angel promised to [[moses]] (exod.
14.9.) for the armies [[army]] guide: for this cloudy pillar, is said, to have
descended, and stood at the dore of the tabernacle, and to have talked
with [[moses]].

there you see motion, and [[speech]], which are commonly attributed to
angels, attributed to a cloud, because the cloud served as a sign of
gods presence; and was no lesse an angel, then if it had had the form of
a [[man]], or child of never so [[great]] [[beauty]]; or wings, as usually they are
painted, for the false instruction of [[common]] [[people]]. for it is not the
shape; but their use, that makes them angels. but their use is to be
significations of gods presence in supernaturall operations; as when
moses (exod. 33.14.) had [[desired]] [[god]] to goe along with the campe, (as
he had done alwaies before the making of the golden calfe,) [[god]] did not
answer, "i will goe," nor "i will send an angel in my stead;" but thus,
"my presence shall goe with thee."

to mention all the places of the old testament where the name of angel
is found, would be too long. therefore to comprehend them all at once,
i say, there is no text in that part of the old testament, which the
church of [[england]] holdeth for canonicall, from which we can conclude,
there is, or hath been created, any permanent thing (understood by the
name of spirit or angel,) that hath not quantity; and that may not be,
by the understanding divided; that is to say, considered by parts; so
as one part may bee in one place, and the next part in the next place
to it; and, in summe, which is not (taking [[body]] for that, which is some
what, or some where) corporeall; but in every place, the sense will bear
the interpretation of angel, for messenger; as john baptist is called
an angel, and [[christ]] the angel of the covenant; and as (according to the
same analogy) the dove, and the fiery tongues, in that they were signes
of gods speciall presence, might also be called angels. though we find
in daniel two names of angels, gabriel, and michael; yet is cleer out of
the text it selfe, (dan. 12.1) that by michael is meant [[christ]], not as
an angel, but as a [[prince]]: and that gabriel (as the like apparitions
made to other holy [[men]] in their sleep) was nothing but a supernaturall
phantasme, by which it seemed to daniel, in his [[dream]], that two saints
being in talke, one of them said to the other, "gabriel, let us make
this [[man]] [[understand]] his vision:" for [[god]] needeth not, to distinguish
his celestiall servants by names, which are usefull onely to the short
memories of mortalls. nor in the new testament is there any place, out
of which it can be proved, that angels (except when they are put for
such [[men]], as [[god]] hath made the messengers, and ministers of his word,
or works) are things permanent, and withall incorporeall. that they
are permanent, may bee gathered from the words of our saviour himselfe,
(mat. 25.41.) where he saith, it shall be said to the wicked in the last
day, "go ye cursed into everlasting [[fire]] prepared for the [[devil]] and his
angels:" which place is manifest for the permanence of evill angels,
(unlesse wee might [[think]] the name of devill and his angels may be
understood of the churches [[church]] adversaries and their ministers;) but then
it is repugnant to their immateriality; because everlasting [[fire]] is no
punishment to impatible substances, such as are all things incorporeall.
angels therefore are not thence proved to be incorporeall. in like
manner where st. paul sayes (1 cor. 6.3.) "knew ye not that wee shall
judge the angels?" and (2 pet. 2.4.) "for if [[god]] spared not the angels
that sinned, but cast them down into hell." and (jude 1,6.) "and the
angels that kept not their first estate, but left their owne habitation,
hee hath reserved in everlasting chaines under darknesse unto the
judgement of the [[last]] day;" though it prove the permanence of angelicall
nature, it confirmeth also their materiality. and (mat. 22.30.) in the
resurrection [[men]] doe neither [[marry]], nor give in [[marriage]], but are as
the angels of [[god]] in [[heaven]]:" but in the resurrection [[men]] shall be
permanent, and not incorporeall; so therefore also are the angels.

there be divers other places out of which may be drawn the like
conclusion. to [[men]] that [[understand]] the signification of these words,
substance, and incorporeall; as incorporeall is taken not for subtile
body, but for not [[body]], they imply a contradiction: insomuch as to say,
an angel, or spirit is (in that sense) an incorporeall substance, is
to say in effect, there is no angel nor spirit at all. considering
therefore the signification of the word angel in the old testament, and
the [[nature]] of dreams [[dream]] and visions that happen to [[men]] by the ordinary way
of [[nature]]; i was enclined to this [[opinion]], that angels were nothing
but supernaturall apparitions of the fancy, raised by the speciall
and extraordinary operation of [[god]], thereby to make his presence and
commandements known to [[mankind]], and chiefly to his own [[people]]. but the
many places of the new testament, and our saviours own words, and in
such texts, wherein is no suspicion of [[corruption]] of the [[scripture]], have
extorted from my feeble [[reason]], an acknowledgement, and beleef, that
there be also angels substantiall, and permanent. but to beleeve they be
in no place, that is to say, no where, that is to say, nothing, as they
(though indirectly) say, that will have them incorporeall, cannot by
scripture bee evinced.




inspiration what

on the signification of the word spirit, dependeth that of the word
inspiration; which must either be taken properly; and then it is nothing
but the blowing into a [[man]] some thin and subtile aire, or wind, in such
manner as a [[man]] filleth a bladder with his breath; or if spirits be not
corporeal, but have their existence only in the fancy, it is nothing but
the blowing in of a phantasme; which is improper to say, and impossible;
for phantasmes are not, but only seem to be somewhat. that word
therefore is used in the [[scripture]] metaphorically onely: as (gen. 2.7.)
where it is said, that [[god]] inspired into [[man]] the breath of [[life]], no more
is meant, then that [[god]] gave unto him vitall motion. for we are not to
think that [[god]] made first a living breath, and then blew it into adam
after he was made, whether that breath were reall, or seeming; but only
as it is (acts 17.25.) "that he gave him [[life]] and breath;" that is,
made him a living creature. and where it is said (2 tim. 3.16.) "all
scripture is given by inspiration from [[god]]," speaking there of the
scripture of the old testament, it is an easie metaphor, to signifie,
that [[god]] enclined the spirit or [[mind]] of those writers, to write that
which should be usefull, in teaching, reproving, correcting, and
instructing [[men]] in the way of righteous living. but where st. peter (2
pet. 1.21.) saith, that "prophecy came not in old [[time]] by the will
of [[man]], but the holy [[men]] of [[god]] spake as they were moved by the holy
spirit," by the holy spirit, is meant the voice of [[god]] in a [[dream]], or
vision supernaturall, which is not inspiration; nor when our saviour
breathing on his disciples, said, "receive the holy spirit," was that
breath the spirit, but a sign of the spirituall graces he gave unto
them. and though it be said of many, and of our saviour himself, that he
was full of the holy spirit; yet that fulnesse is not to be understood
for infusion of the substance of [[god]], but for accumulation of his gifts,
such as are the gift of [[sanctity]] of [[life]], of tongues, and the like,
whether attained supernaturally, or by study and industry; for in all
cases they are the gifts of [[god]]. so likewise where [[god]] sayes (joel
2.28.) "i will powre out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons [[son]] and
your daughters [[daughter]] shall prophecy, your old [[men]] shall [[dream]] dreams [[dream]], and your
young [[men]] shall see visions," wee are not to [[understand]] it in the
proper sense, as if his spirit were like water, [[subject]] to effusion, or
infusion; but as if [[god]] had promised to give them propheticall dreams [[dream]],
and visions. for the proper use of the word infused, in speaking of
the graces of [[god]], is an [[abuse]] of it; for those graces are vertues, not
bodies to be carryed hither and thither, and to be powred into [[men]], as
into barrels.

in the same manner, to take inspiration in the proper sense, or to
say that [[good]] spirits entred into [[men]] to make them prophecy, or evill
spirits into those that became phrenetique, lunatique, or epileptique,
is not to take the word in the sense of the [[scripture]]; for the spirit
there is taken for the [[power]] of [[god]], working by causes to us unknown. as
also (acts 2.2.) the wind, that is there said to fill the house wherein
the [[apostles]] were assembled on the day of pentecost, is not to be
understood for the holy spirit, which is the deity it [[self]]; but for an
externall sign of gods speciall working on their hearts [[heart]], to effect in
them the internall graces, and holy vertues hee [[thought]] requisite for
the performance of their apostleship.




chapter xxxv. of the signification in [[scripture]] of kingdome of [[god]], of
holy, [[sacred]], and sacrament


kingdom of [[god]] taken by divines metaphorically but in the scriptures
properly

the kingdome of [[god]] in the writings of divines, and specially in
sermons, and treatises of devotion, is taken most commonly for eternall
felicity, after this [[life]], in the highest [[heaven]], which they also call
the kingdome of [[glory]]; and sometimes for (the earnest of that felicity)
sanctification, which they terme the kingdome of grace, but never
for the [[monarchy]], that is to say, the soveraign [[power]] of [[god]] over
any subjects [[subject]] acquired by their own [[consent]], which is the proper
signification of kingdome.

to the contrary, i find the kingdome of [[god]], to signifie in most places
of [[scripture]], a kingdome properly so named, constituted by the votes
of the [[people]] of [[israel]] in peculiar manner; wherein they chose god
for their [[king]] by covenant made with him, upon gods promising them the
possession of the [[land]] of canaan; and but seldom metaphorically;
and then it is taken for dominion over sinne; (and only in the new
testament;) because such a dominion as that, every [[subject]] shall have in
the kingdome of [[god]], and without prejudice to the soveraign.

from the very creation, [[god]] not only reigned over all [[men]] naturally by
his might; but also had peculiar subjects [[subject]], whom he commanded by a voice,
as one [[man]] speaketh to another. in which manner he reigned over adam,
and gave him commandement to abstaine from the tree of cognizance of
good and evill; which when he obeyed not, but tasting thereof, took upon
him to be as [[god]], judging between [[good]] and evill, not by his creators
commandement, but by his own sense, his [[punishment]] was a privation of
the estate of eternall [[life]], wherein [[god]] had at first created him: and
afterwards [[god]] punished his [[posterity]], for their vices [[vice]], all but eight
persons, with an universall deluge; and in these eight did consist the
then kingdome of [[god]].




the originall of the kingdome of god

after this, it pleased [[god]] to speak to [[abraham]], and (gen. 17.7,8.) to
make a covenant with him in these words, "i will establish my covenant
between me, and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations [[generation]],
for an everlasting covenant, to be a [[god]] to thee, and to thy seed after
thee; and i will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land
wherein thou art [[arts]] a stranger, all the [[land]] of canaan for an everlasting
possession." and for a memoriall, and a token of this covenant, he
ordaineth (verse 11.) the sacrament of circumcision. this is it which is
called the old covenant, or testament; and containeth a contract between
god and [[abraham]]; by which [[abraham]] obligeth himself, and his [[posterity]],
in a peculiar manner to be [[subject]] to gods positive [[law]]; for to the law
morall he was obliged before, as by an oath of allegiance. and though
the name of [[king]] be not yet given to [[god]], nor of kingdome to [[abraham]] and
his seed; yet the thing is the same; namely, an institution by pact,
of gods peculiar soveraignty over the seed of [[abraham]]; which in the
renewing of the same covenant by [[moses]], at mount sinai, is expressely
called a peculiar kingdome of [[god]] over the [[jews]]: and it is of abraham
(not of moses) st. paul saith (rom. 4.11.) that he is the "father of the
faithfull," that is, of those that are loyall, and doe not violate their
allegiance sworn to [[god]], then by circumcision, and afterwards in the new
covenant by baptisme.




that the kingdome of [[god]] is properly his civill soveraignty over a
peculiar [[people]] by pact

this covenant, at the foot of mount sinai, was renewed by [[moses]] (exod.
19.5.) where the [[lord]] commandeth [[moses]] to speak to the [[people]] in this
manner, "if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then
yee shall be a peculiar [[people]] to me, for all the [[earth]] is mine; and
yee shall be unto me a sacerdotall kingdome, and an holy nation." for a
"peculiar people" the vulgar latine hath, peculium de cunctis populis:
the english translation made in the beginning of the reign of king
james, hath, a "peculiar treasure unto me above all nations;" and the
geneva french, "the most precious jewel of all nations." but the truest
translation is the first, because it is confirmed by st. paul himself
(tit. 2.14.) where he saith, alluding to that place, that our blessed
saviour "gave himself for us, that he might purifie us to himself, a
peculiar (that is, an extraordinary) [[people]]:" for the word is in the
greek periousios, which is opposed commonly to the word epiousios: and
as this signifieth ordinary, quotidian, or (as in the lords [[lord]] prayer) of
daily use; so the other signifieth that which is overplus, and stored
up, and enjoyed in a speciall manner; which the latines call peculium;
and this meaning of the place is confirmed by the [[reason]] [[god]] rendereth
of it, which followeth immediately, in that he addeth, "for all the
earth is mine," as if he should say, "all the nations of the [[world]] are
mine;" but it is not so that you are mine, but in a speciall manner: for
they are all mine, by [[reason]] of my [[power]]; but you shall be mine, by your
own [[consent]], and covenant; which is an addition to his ordinary title,
to all nations.

the same is again confirmed in expresse words in the same text, "yee
shall be to me a sacerdotall kingdome, and an holy nation." the vulgar
latine hath it, regnum sacerdotale, to which agreeth the translation of
that place (1 pet. 2.9.) sacerdotium regale, a regal priesthood; as also
the institution it [[self]], by which no [[man]] might enter into the sanctum
sanctorum, that is to say, no [[man]] might enquire gods will immediately of
god himselfe, but onely the high [[priest]]. the english translation before
mentioned, following that of geneva, has, "a kingdome of priests [[priest]];" which
is either meant of the succession of one high [[priest]] after another, or
else it accordeth not with st. peter, nor with the exercise of the high
priesthood; for there was never any but the high [[priest]] onely, that was
to informe the [[people]] of gods will; nor any convocation of priests [[priest]] ever
allowed to enter into the sanctum sanctorum.

again, the title of a holy nation confirmes the same: for holy
signifies, that which is gods by speciall, not by generall [[right]]. all
the [[earth]] (as is said in the text) is gods; but all the [[earth]] is
not called holy, but that onely which is set apart for his especiall
service, as was the nation of the [[jews]]. it is therefore manifest enough
by this one place, that by the kingdome of [[god]], is properly meant a
common-wealth, instituted (by the [[consent]] of those which were to be
subject thereto) for their civill [[government]], and the regulating of
their behaviour, not onely towards [[god]] their [[king]], but also towards one
another in point of [[justice]], and towards other nations both in [[peace]] and
warre; which properly was a kingdome, wherein [[god]] was [[king]], and the
high [[priest]] was to be (after the [[death]] of moses) his sole viceroy, or
lieutenant.

but there be many other places that clearly prove the same. as first (1
sam. 8.7.) when the elders of [[israel]] (grieved with the [[corruption]] of
the sons [[son]] of samuel) demanded a [[king]], samuel displeased therewith, prayed
unto the [[lord]]; and the [[lord]] answering said unto him, "hearken unto the
voice of the [[people]], for they have not rejected thee, but they have
rejected me, that i should not reign over them." out of which it is
evident, that [[god]] himself was then their [[king]]; and samuel did not
command the [[people]], but only delivered to them that which [[god]] from time
to [[time]] appointed him.

again, (1 sam. 12.12.) where samuel saith to the [[people]], "when yee saw
that nahash [[king]] of the [[children]] of ammon came against you, ye said unto
me, nay, but a [[king]] shall reign over us, when the [[lord]] your [[god]] was your
king:" it is manifest that [[god]] was their [[king]], and governed the civill
state of their common-wealth.

and after the israelites had rejected [[god]], the prophets [[prophet]] did foretell his
restitution; as (isaiah 24.23.) "then the moon shall be confounded, and
the sun ashamed when the [[lord]] of hosts shall reign in mount zion, and
in [[jerusalem]];" where he speaketh expressely of his reign in zion, and
jerusalem; that is, on [[earth]]. and (micah 4.7.) "and the [[lord]] shall
reign over them in mount zion:" this mount zion is in [[jerusalem]] upon the
earth. and (ezek. 20.33.) "as i [[live]], saith the [[lord]] [[god]], surely with a
mighty hand, and a stretched out arme, and with fury powred out, i wil
rule over you; and (verse 37.) i will cause you to passe under the rod,
and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant;" that is, i will
reign over you, and make you to stand to that covenant which you made
with me by [[moses]], and brake in your rebellion against me in the days of
samuel, and in your election of another [[king]].

and in the new testament, the angel gabriel saith of our saviour (luke
1.32,33) "he shall be [[great]], and be called the [[son]] of the most high,
and the [[lord]] shall give him the [[throne]] of his [[father]] [[david]]; and he shall
reign over the house of jacob for ever; and of his kingdome there shall
be no end." this is also a kingdome upon [[earth]]; for the claim whereof,
as an [[enemy]] to caesar, he was put to [[death]]; the title of his crosse,
was, [[jesus]] of nazareth, [[king]] of the [[jews]]; hee was crowned in scorn with
a [[crown]] of thornes; and for the proclaiming of him, it is said of
the disciples (acts 17.7.) "that they did all of them contrary to
the decrees of caesar, saying there was another [[king]], one [[jesus]]. the
kingdome therefore of [[god]], is a reall, not a metaphoricall kingdome; and
so taken, not onely in the old testament, but the new; when we say, "for
thine is the kingdome, the [[power]], and [[glory]]," it is to be understood of
gods kingdome, by [[force]] of our covenant, not by the [[right]] of gods [[power]];
for such a kingdome [[god]] alwaies hath; so that it were superfluous to
say in our prayer, "thy kingdome come," unlesse it be meant of the
restauration of that kingdome of [[god]] by [[christ]], which by revolt of the
israelites had been interrupted in the election of saul. nor had it been
proper to say, "the kingdome of [[heaven]] is at hand," or to [[pray]], "thy
kingdome come," if it had still continued.

there be so many other places that confirm this interpretation, that it
were a wonder there is no greater notice taken of it, but that it gives
too much [[light]] to [[christian]] kings [[king]] to see their [[right]] of ecclesiastical
government. this they have observed, that in stead of a sacerdotall
kingdome, translate, a kingdome of priests [[priest]]: for they may as well
translate a royall priesthood, (as it is in st. peter) into a priesthood
of kings [[king]]. and whereas, for a peculiar [[people]], they put a pretious jewel,
or treasure, a [[man]] might as well call the speciall regiment, or company
of a generall, the generalls pretious jewel, or his treasure.

in short, the kingdome of [[god]] is a civill kingdome; which consisted,
first in the obligation of the [[people]] of [[israel]] to those laws [[law]], which
moses should bring unto them from mount sinai; and which afterwards the
high [[priest]] of the [[time]] being, should deliver to them from before the
cherubins in the sanctum sanctorum; and which kingdome having been cast
off, in the election of saul, the prophets [[prophet]] foretold, should be restored
by [[christ]]; and the restauration whereof we daily [[pray]] for, when we
say in the lords [[lord]] prayer, "thy kingdome come;" and the [[right]] whereof we
acknowledge, when we adde, "for thine is the kingdome, the [[power]], and
glory, for ever and ever, amen;" and the proclaiming whereof, was
the preaching of the [[apostles]]; and to which [[men]] are prepared, by the
teachers of the gospel; to embrace which gospel, (that is to say, to
promise [[obedience]] to gods government) is, to bee in the kingdome of
grace, because [[god]] hath gratis given to such the [[power]] to bee the
subjects (that is, children) of [[god]] hereafter, when [[christ]] shall come
in majesty to [[judge]] the [[world]], and actually to govern his owne [[people]],
which is called the kingdome of [[glory]]. if the kingdome of [[god]] (called
also the kingdome of [[heaven]], from the gloriousnesse, and admirable
height of that throne) were not a kingdome which [[god]] by his lieutenant,
or vicars, who deliver his commandements to the [[people]], did exercise on
earth; there would not have been so much contention, and warre, about
who it is, by whom [[god]] speaketh to us; neither would many priests [[priest]] have
troubled themselves with spirituall jurisdiction, nor any [[king]] have
denied it them.

out of this literall interpretation of the kingdome of [[god]], ariseth also
the true interpretation of the word holy. for it is a word, which in
gods kingdome answereth to that, which [[men]] in their kingdomes use to
call publique, or the kings [[king]].

the [[king]] of any countrey is the publique [[person]], or representative of
all his own subjects [[subject]]. and [[god]] the [[king]] of [[israel]] was the holy one of
israel. the nation which is [[subject]] to one earthly soveraign, is the
nation of that soveraign, that is, of the publique [[person]]. so the [[jews]],
who were gods nation, were called (exod. 19.6.) "a holy nation." for by
holy, is alwaies understood, either [[god]] himselfe, or that which is gods
in propriety; as by publique is alwaies meant, either the [[person]] of the
common-wealth it [[self]], or something that is so the common-wealths, as no
private [[person]] can claim any propriety therein.

therefore the [[sabbath]] (gods day) is a holy day; the temple, (gods house)
a holy house; sacrifices [[sacrifice]], tithes, and offerings (gods tribute) holy
duties; priests [[priest]], prophets [[prophet]], and anointed kings [[king]], under [[christ]] (gods
ministers) holy [[men]]; the coelestiall ministring spirits (gods
messengers) holy angels; and the like: and wheresoever the word holy is
taken properly, there is still something signified of propriety, gotten
by [[consent]]. in saying "hallowed be thy name," we do but [[pray]] to [[god]] for
grace to keep the first commandement, of "having no other gods but
him." [[mankind]] is gods nation in propriety: but the [[jews]] only were a holy
nation. why, but because they became his propriety by covenant.




sacred what

and the word profane, is usually taken in the [[scripture]] for the same
with [[common]]; and consequently their contraries, holy, and proper, in the
kingdome of [[god]] must be the same also. but figuratively, those [[men]] also
are called holy, that [[led]] such godly lives [[life]], as if they had forsaken all
worldly designes, and wholly devoted, and given themselves to [[god]].
in the proper sense, that which is made holy by gods appropriating or
separating it to his own use, is said to be sanctified by [[god]], as the
seventh day in the fourth commandement; and as the elect in the new
testament were said to bee sanctified, when they were endued with the
spirit of godlinesse. and that which is made holy by the dedication of
men, and given to [[god]], so as to be used onely in his publique service,
is called also [[sacred]], and said to be consecrated, as temples, and other
houses of publique prayer, and their utensils, priests [[priest]], and ministers,
victimes, offerings, and the externall matter of sacraments.




degrees of sanctity

of holinesse there be degrees [[degree]]: for of those things that are set apart
for the service of [[god]], there may bee some set apart again, for a neerer
and more especial service. the whole nation of the israelites were a
people holy to [[god]]; yet the tribe of levi was amongst the israelites a
holy tribe; and amongst the levites, the priests [[priest]] were yet more holy; and
amongst the priests [[priest]], the high [[priest]] was the most holy. so the land
of judea was the holy [[land]]; but the holy [[city]] wherein [[god]] was to be
worshipped, was more holy; and again, the temples more holy than the
city; and the sanctum sanctorum more holy than the rest of the temple.




sacrament

a sacrament, is a separation of some visible thing from [[common]] use;
and a consecration of it to gods service, for a sign, either of our
admission into the kingdome of [[god]], to be of the number of his peculiar
people, or for a commemoration of the same. in the old testament, the
sign of admission was circumcision; in the new testament, baptisme. the
commemoration of it in the old testament, was the eating (at a certain
time, which was anniversary) of the paschall lamb; by which they were
put in [[mind]] of the night wherein they were delivered out of their
bondage in [[egypt]]; and in the new testament, the celebrating of the
lords supper; by which, we are put in [[mind]], of our deliverance from
the bondage of [[sin]], by our blessed saviours [[death]] upon the crosse. the
sacraments of admission, are but once to be used, because there needs
but one admission; but because we have need of being often put in
mind of our deliverance, and of our allegeance, the sacraments of
commemoration have need to be reiterated. and these are the principall
sacraments, and as it were the solemne oathes we make of our
alleageance. there be also other consecrations, that may be called
sacraments, as the word implyeth onely consecration to gods service; but
as it implies an oath, or promise of alleageance to [[god]], there were no
other in the old testament, but circumcision, and the passover; nor
are there any other in the new testament, but baptisme, and the lords
supper.



chapter xxxvi. of the word of [[god]], and of prophets




word what

when there is mention of the word of [[god]], or of [[man]], it doth not
signifie a part of [[speech]], such as grammarians call a nown, or a verb,
or any simple voice, without a contexture with other words to make it
significative; but a [[perfect]] [[speech]] or discourse, whereby the speaker
affirmeth, denieth, commandeth, promiseth, threateneth, wisheth, or
interrogateth. in which sense it is not vocabulum, that signifies a
word; but sermo, (in [[greek]] logos) that is some [[speech]], discourse, or
saying.




the words spoken by [[god]] and concerning [[god]], both are called gods word
in scripture

again, if we say the word of [[god]], or of [[man]], it may bee understood
sometimes of the speaker, (as the words that [[god]] hath spoken, or that
a [[man]] hath spoken): in which sense, when we say, the gospel of st.
matthew, we [[understand]] st. matthew to be the writer of it: and sometimes
of the [[subject]]: in which sense, when we [[read]] in the bible, "the words
of the days of the kings [[king]] of [[israel]], or judah," ’tis meant, that the acts
that were done in those days, were the [[subject]] of those words; and in
the [[greek]], which (in the scripture) retaineth many hebraismes, by the
word of [[god]] is oftentimes meant, not that which is spoken by [[god]], but
concerning [[god]], and his [[government]]; that is to say, the doctrine of
religion: insomuch, as it is all one, to say logos theou, and theologia;
which is, that doctrine which wee usually call divinity, as is manifest
by the places following (acts 13.46.) "then paul and barnabas waxed
bold, and said, it was necessary that the word of [[god]] should first
have been spoken to you, but seeing you put it from you, and [[judge]] your
selves unworthy of everlasting [[life]], loe, we turn to the gentiles."
that which is here called the word of [[god]], was the doctrine of christian
religion; as it appears evidently by that which goes before. and (acts
5.20.) where it is said to the [[apostles]] by an angel, "go stand and speak
in the temple, all the words of this [[life]];" by the words of this [[life]],
is meant, the doctrine of the gospel; as is evident by what they did in
the temple, and is expressed in the [[last]] verse of the same chap. "daily
in the temple, and in every house they ceased not to [[teach]] and preach
christ [[jesus]]:" in which place it is manifest, that [[jesus]] [[christ]] was the
subject of this word of [[life]]; or (which is all one) the [[subject]] of the
words of this [[life]] eternall, that our saviour offered them. so (acts
15.7.) the word of [[god]], is called the word of the gospel, because it
containeth the doctrine of the kingdome of [[christ]]; and the same word
(rom. 10.8,9.) is called the word of [[faith]]; that is, as is there
expressed, the doctrine of [[christ]] come, and raised from the [[dead]]. also
(mat. 13. 19.) "when any one heareth the word of the kingdome;" that is,
the doctrine of the kingdome taught by [[christ]]. again, the same word, is
said (acts 12. 24.) "to grow and to be multiplied;" which to understand
of the evangelicall doctrine is easie, but of the voice, or speech
of [[god]], hard and [[strange]]. in the same sense the doctrine of devils [[devil]],
signifieth not the words of any devill, but the doctrine of heathen men
concerning daemons, and those phantasms which they worshipped as gods.
(1 tim. 4.1.)

considering these two significations of the word of [[god]], as it is taken
in [[scripture]], it is manifest in this later sense (where it is taken for
the doctrine of the [[christian]] [[religion]],) that the whole [[scripture]] is the
word of [[god]]: but in the former sense not so. for [[example]], though these
words, "i am the [[lord]] thy [[god]], &c." to the end of the ten commandements,
were spoken by [[god]] to [[moses]]; yet the preface, "god spake these words
and said," is to be understood for the words of him that wrote the holy
history. the word of [[god]], as it is taken for that which he hath spoken,
is understood sometimes properly, sometimes metaphorically. properly,
as the words, he hath spoken to his prophets [[prophet]]; metaphorically, for his
wisdome, [[power]], and eternall decree, in making the [[world]]; in which
sense, those fiats, "let there be [[light]]," "let there be a firmament,"
"let us make [[man]]," &c. (gen. 1.) are the word of [[god]]. and in the same
sense it is said (john 1.3.) "all things were made by it, and without it
was nothing made that was made; and (heb. 1.3.) "he upholdeth all things
by the word of his [[power]];" that is, by the [[power]] of his word; that is,
by his [[power]]; and (heb. 11.3.) "the worlds [[world]] were framed by the word
of [[god]];" and many other places to the same sense: as also amongst the
latines, the name of [[fate]], which signifieth properly the word spoken, is
taken in the same sense.




secondly, for the effect of his word

secondly, for the effect of his word; that is to say, for the thing it
self, which by his word is affirmed, commanded, threatned, or promised;
as (psalm 105.19.) where joseph is said to have been kept in prison,
"till his word was come;" that is, till that was come to passe which
he had (gen. 40.13.) foretold to pharaohs butler, concerning his being
restored to his office: for there by his word was come, is meant, the
thing it [[self]] was come to passe. so also (1 [[king]]. 18.36.) elijah saith
to [[god]], "i have done all these thy words," in stead of "i have done all
these things at thy word," or commandement: and (jer. 17.15.) "where is
the word of the [[lord]]," is put for, "where is the evill he threatened:"
and (ezek. 12.28.) "there shall none of my words be prolonged any
more:" by "words" are understood those things, which [[god]] promised to his
people. and in the new testament (mat. 24.35.) "heaven and [[earth]] shal
pass away, but my words shall not pass away;" that is, there is nothing
that i have promised or foretold, that shall not come to passe. and in
this sense it is, that st. john the evangelist, and, i [[think]], st. john
onely calleth our saviour himself as in the flesh "the word of god
(as joh. 1.14.) the word was made flesh;" that is to say, the word, or
promise that [[christ]] should come into the [[world]], "who in the beginning
was with [[god]];" that is to say, it was in the [[purpose]] of [[god]] the [[father]],
to send [[god]] the [[son]] into the [[world]], to enlighten [[men]] in the way of
eternall [[life]], but it was not till then put in execution, and actually
incarnate; so that our saviour is there called "the word," not because
he was the promise, but the thing promised. they that taking occasion
from this place, doe commonly call him the verbe of [[god]], do but render
the text more obscure. they might as well term him the nown of [[god]]:
for as by nown, so also by verbe, [[men]] [[understand]] nothing but a part
of [[speech]], a voice, a sound, that neither affirms, nor denies, nor
commands, nor promiseth, nor is any substance corporeall, or spirituall;
and therefore it cannot be said to bee either [[god]], or [[man]]; whereas our
saviour is both. and this word which st. john in his gospel saith was
with [[god]], is (in his 1 epistle, verse 1.) called "the word of [[life]];" and
(verse 2.) "the eternall [[life]], which was with the [[father]]:" so that he
can be in no other sense called the word, then in that, wherein he is
called eternall [[life]]; that is, "he that hath procured us eternall [[life]],"
by his comming in the flesh. so also (apocalypse 19.13.) the apostle
speaking of [[christ]], clothed in a garment dipt in bloud, saith; his name
is "the word of [[god]];" which is to be understood, as if he had said his
name had been, "he that was come according to the [[purpose]] of [[god]] from
the beginning, and according to his word and promises delivered by the
prophets." so that there is nothing here of the incarnation of a word,
but of the incarnation of [[god]] the [[son]], therefore called the word,
because his incarnation was the performance of the promise; in like
manner as the holy ghost is called the promise. (acts 1.4. luke 24.49.)




thirdly, for the words of [[reason]] and equity

there are also places of the [[scripture]], where, by the word of [[god]], is
signified such words as are consonant to [[reason]], and equity, though
spoken sometimes neither by [[prophet]], nor by a holy [[man]]. for pharaoh
necho was an idolator; yet his words to the [[good]] [[king]] josiah, in which
he advised him by messengers, not to oppose him in his march against
carchemish, are said to have proceeded from the mouth of [[god]]; and that
josiah not hearkning to them, was slain in the [[battle]]; as is to be read
2 chron. 35. vers. 21,22,23. it is true, that as the same [[history]] is
related in the first [[book]] of esdras, not pharaoh, but jeremiah spake
these words to josiah, from the mouth of the [[lord]]. but wee are to
give credit to the canonicall [[scripture]], whatsoever be written in the
apocrypha.

the word of [[god]], is then also to be taken for the dictates of [[reason]],
and equity, when the same is said in the scriptures [[scripture]] to bee written in
mans [[heart]]; as psalm 36.31. jerem. 31.33. deut.30.11, 14. and many other
like places.




divers acceptions of the word prophet

the name of [[prophet]], signifieth in [[scripture]] sometimes prolocutor; that
is, he that speaketh from [[god]] to [[man]], or from [[man]] to [[god]]: and sometimes
praedictor, or a foreteller of things to come; and sometimes one that
speaketh incoherently, as [[men]] that are distracted. it is most frequently
used in the sense of speaking from [[god]] to the [[people]]. so [[moses]], samuel,
elijah, isaiah, jeremiah, and others were prophets [[prophet]]. and in this sense
the high [[priest]] was a [[prophet]], for he only went into the sanctum
sanctorum, to enquire of [[god]]; and was to declare his [[answer]] to the
people. and therefore when caiphas said, it was expedient that one man
should [[die]] for the [[people]], st. john saith (chap. 11.51.) that "he spake
not this of himselfe, but being high [[priest]] that year, he prophesied
that one [[man]] should dye for the nation." also they that in christian
congregations taught the [[people]], (1 cor. 14.3.) are said to prophecy. in
the like sense it is, that [[god]] saith to [[moses]] (exod. 4.16.) concerning
aaron, "he shall be thy spokes-man to the [[people]]; and he shall be to
thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him in stead of [[god]];" that which here
is spokesman, is (chap.7.1.) interpreted [[prophet]]; "see (saith god)
i have made thee a [[god]] to pharaoh, and aaron thy [[brother]] shall be thy
prophet." in the sense of speaking from [[man]] to [[god]], [[abraham]] is called
a [[prophet]] (genes. 20.7.) where [[god]] in a [[dream]] speaketh to abimelech
in this manner, "now therefore restore the [[man]] his [[wife]], for he is a
prophet, and shall [[pray]] for thee;" whereby may be also gathered,
that the name of [[prophet]] may be given, not unproperly to them that
in [[christian]] churches [[church]], have a calling to say publique prayers for the
congregation. in the same sense, the prophets [[prophet]] that came down from the
high place (or hill of god) with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe,
and a harp (1 sam. 10.5,6.) and (vers. 10.) saul amongst them, are said
to prophecy, in that they praised [[god]], in that manner publiquely. in the
like sense, is miriam (exod. 15.20.) called a prophetesse. so is it
also to be taken (1 cor. 11.4,5.) where st. paul saith, "every [[man]] that
prayeth or prophecyeth with his head covered, &c. and every woman that
prayeth or prophecyeth with her head uncovered: for prophecy in that
place, signifieth no more, but praising [[god]] in psalmes, and holy songs [[song]];
which [[women]] might doe in the [[church]], though it were not lawfull for them
to speak to the congregation. and in this signification it is, that the
poets of the heathen, that composed hymnes and other sorts of poems in
the [[honor]] of their gods, were called vates (prophets) as is well enough
known by all that are versed in the books [[book]] of the gentiles, and as
is evident (tit. 1.12.) where st. paul saith of the cretians, that a
prophet of their owne said, they were liars; not that st. paul held
their poets for prophets [[prophet]], but acknowledgeth that the word [[prophet]] was
commonly used to signifie them that celebrated the [[honour]] of [[god]] in
verse




praediction of future contingents, not alwaies prophecy

when by prophecy is meant praediction, or foretelling of future
contingents; not only they were prophets [[prophet]], who were gods spokesmen, and
foretold those things to others, which [[god]] had foretold to them; but
also all those imposters, that pretend by the helpe of familiar spirits,
or by [[superstitious]] divination of events [[past]], from false causes, to
foretell the like events in [[time]] to come: of which (as i have declared
already in the 12. [[chapter]] of this discourse) there be many kinds [[kind]], who
gain in the [[opinion]] of the [[common]] sort of [[men]], a greater reputation
of prophecy, by one casuall event that may bee but wrested to their
purpose, than can be lost again by never so many failings. prophecy is
not an art [[arts]], nor (when it is taken for praediction) a constant vocation;
but an extraordinary, and temporary employment from [[god]], most often of
good [[men]], but sometimes also of the wicked. the woman of endor, who
is said to have had a familiar spirit, and thereby to have raised a
phantasme of samuel, and foretold saul his [[death]], was not therefore a
prophetesse; for neither had she any [[science]], whereby she could raise
such a phantasme; nor does it appear that [[god]] commanded the raising of
it; but onely guided that imposture to be a means of sauls terror and
discouragement; and by consequent, of the discomfiture, by which he
fell. and for incoherent [[speech]], it was amongst the gentiles taken for
one sort of prophecy, because the prophets [[prophet]] of their oracles, intoxicated
with a spirit, or vapour from the cave of the pythian oracle at delphi,
were for the [[time]] really mad, and spake like mad-men; of whose loose
words a sense might be made to fit any event, in such sort, as all
bodies are said to be made of materia prima. in the [[scripture]] i find
it also so taken (1 sam. 18. 10.) in these words, "and the evill spirit
came upon saul, and he prophecyed in the midst of the house."




the manner how [[god]] hath spoken to the prophets

and although there be so many significations in [[scripture]] of the word
prophet; yet is that the most frequent, in which it is taken for him,
to whom [[god]] speaketh immediately, that which the [[prophet]] is to say from
him, to some other [[man]], or to the [[people]]. and hereupon a [[question]] may
be [[asked]], in what manner [[god]] speaketh to such a [[prophet]]. can it (may some
say) be properly said, that [[god]] hath voice and [[language]], when it cannot
be properly said, he hath a tongue, or other organs, as a [[man]]? the
prophet [[david]] argueth thus, "shall he that made the eye, not see? or he
that made the ear, not hear?" but this may be spoken, not (as usually) to
signifie gods [[nature]], but to signifie our intention to [[honor]] him. for
to see, and hear, are honorable attributes, and may be given to [[god]], to
declare (as far as our capacity can conceive) his almighty [[power]]. but
if it were to be taken in the strict, and proper sense, one might argue
from his making of all parts of mans [[man]] [[body]], that he had also the same use
of them which we have; which would be many of them so uncomely, as it
would be the [[greatest]] contumely in the [[world]] to ascribe them to him.
therefore we are to interpret gods speaking to [[men]] immediately, for that
way (whatsoever it be), by which [[god]] makes them [[understand]] his will: and
the wayes whereby he doth this, are many; and to be sought onely in the
holy [[scripture]]: where though many times [[time]] it be said, that [[god]] spake to
this, and that [[person]], without declaring in what manner; yet there be
again many places, that deliver also the signes by which they were
to acknowledge his presence, and commandement; and by these may be
understood, how he spake to many of the rest.




to the extraordinary prophets [[prophet]] of the old testament he spake by dreams [[dream]],
or visions

in what manner [[god]] spake to adam, and eve, and cain, and noah, is not
expressed; nor how he spake to [[abraham]], till such [[time]] as he came out of
his own countrey to sichem in the [[land]] of canaan; and then (gen. 12.7.)
god is said to have appeared to him. so there is one way, whereby god
made his presence manifest; that is, by an apparition, or vision. and
again, (gen. 15.1.) the word of the [[lord]] came to [[abraham]] in a vision;
that is to say, somewhat, as a sign of gods presence, appeared as gods
messenger, to speak to him. again, the [[lord]] appeared to [[abraham]] (gen.
18. 1.) by an apparition of three angels; and to abimelech (gen. 20. 3.)
in a [[dream]]: to lot (gen. 19. 1.) by an apparition of two angels: and
to hagar (gen. 21. 17.) by the apparition of one angel: and to abraham
again (gen. 22. 11.) by the apparition of a voice from [[heaven]]: and (gen.
26. 24.) to isaac in the night; (that is, in his sleep, or by dream):
and to jacob (gen. 18. 12.) in a [[dream]]; that is to say (as are the words
of the text) "jacob dreamed that he saw a ladder, &c." and (gen. 32. 1.)
in a vision of angels: and to [[moses]] (exod. 3.2.) in the apparition of a
flame of [[fire]] out of the midst of a bush: and after the [[time]] of [[moses]],
(where the manner how [[god]] spake immediately to [[man]] in the old testament,
is expressed) hee spake alwaies by a vision, or by a [[dream]]; as to
gideon, samuel, eliah, elisha, isaiah, ezekiel, and the rest of the
prophets; and often in the new testament, as to joseph, to st. peter, to
st. paul, and to st. john the evangelist in the apocalypse.

onely to [[moses]] hee spake in a more extraordinary manner in mount sinai,
and in the tabernacle; and to the high [[priest]] in the tabernacle, and in
the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. but [[moses]], and after him the
high priests [[priest]] were prophets [[prophet]] of a more eminent place, and [[degree]] in
gods favour; and [[god]] himself in express words declareth, that to other
prophets hee spake in dreams [[dream]] and visions, but to his servant [[moses]], in
such manner as a [[man]] speaketh to his friend. the words are these (numb.
12. 6,7,8.) "if there be a [[prophet]] among you, i the [[lord]] will make my
self known to him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a [[dream]]. my
servant [[moses]] is not so, who is faithfull in all my house; with him i
will speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, not in dark speeches [[speech]]; and
the similitude of the [[lord]] shall he behold." and (exod. 33. 11.) "the
lord spake to [[moses]] face to face, as a [[man]] speaketh to his friend."
and yet this speaking of [[god]] to [[moses]], was by mediation of an angel, or
angels, as appears expressely, acts 7. ver. 35. and 53. and gal. 3. 19.
and was therefore a vision, though a more cleer vision than was given to
other prophets [[prophet]]. and conformable hereunto, where [[god]] saith (deut. 13. 1.)
"if there arise amongst you a [[prophet]], or dreamer of dreams [[dream]]," the later
word is but the interpretation of the former. and (joel 2. 28.) "your
sons and your daughters [[daughter]] shall prophecy; your old [[men]] shall [[dream]] dreams [[dream]],
and your [[young]] [[men]] shall see visions:" where again, the word prophecy is
expounded by [[dream]], and vision. and in the same manner it was, that god
spake to solomon, promising him wisdome, riches [[rich]], and [[honor]]; for the text
saith, (1 kings [[king]] 3. 15.) "and solomon awoak, and behold it was a [[dream]]:"
so that generally the prophets [[prophet]] extraordinary in the old testament took
notice of the word of [[god]] no otherwise, than from their dreams [[dream]], or
visions, that is to say, from the imaginations [[imagination]] which they had in their
sleep, or in an extasie; which imaginations [[imagination]] in every true [[prophet]] were
supernaturall; but in false prophets [[prophet]] were either naturall, or feigned.

the same prophets [[prophet]] were neverthelesse said to speak by the spirit; as
(zach. 7. 12.) where the [[prophet]] speaking of the jewes, saith, "they
made their hearths hard as adamant, lest they should hear the [[law]], and
the words which the [[lord]] of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former
prophets." by which it is manifest, that speaking by the spirit, or
inspiration, was not a particular manner of gods speaking, different
from vision, when they that were said to speak by the spirit, were
extraordinary prophets [[prophet]], such as for every new message, were to have a
particular commission, or (which is all one) a new [[dream]], or vision.

to prophets [[prophet]] of perpetuall calling, and supreme, [[god]] spake in the
old testament from the [[mercy]] seat, in a manner not expressed in the
scripture. of prophets [[prophet]], that were so by a perpetuall calling in the old
testament, some were supreme, and some subordinate: supreme were first
moses; and after him the high [[priest]], every one for his [[time]], as long
as the priesthood was royall; and after the [[people]] of the [[jews]], had
rejected [[god]], that he should no more reign over them, those kings [[king]] which
submitted themselves to gods [[government]], were also his [[chief]] prophets [[prophet]];
and the high priests [[priest]] office became ministeriall. and when [[god]] was to be
consulted, they put on the holy vestments, and enquired of the [[lord]],
as the [[king]] commanded them, and were deprived of their office, when
the [[king]] [[thought]] fit. for [[king]] saul (1 sam. 13. 9.) commanded the burnt
offering to be brought, and (1 sam. 14. 18.) he commands the [[priest]] to
bring the ark neer him; and (ver. 19.) again to let it alone, because he
saw an advantage upon his enemies [[enemy]]. and in the same [[chapter]] saul asketh
counsell of [[god]]. in like manner [[king]] [[david]], after his being anointed,
though before he had possession of the kingdome, is said to "enquire
of the lord" (1 sam. 23. 2.) whether he should [[fight]] against the
philistines at keilah; and (verse 10.) [[david]] commandeth the [[priest]] to
bring him the ephod, to enquire whether he should stay in keilah,
or not. and [[king]] solomon (1 kings [[king]] 2. 27.) took the priesthood from
abiathar, and gave it (verse 35.) to zadoc. therefore [[moses]], and
the high priests [[priest]], and the pious kings [[king]], who enquired of [[god]] on all
extraordinary occasions [[occasion]], how they were to carry themselves, or what
event they were to have, were all soveraign prophets [[prophet]]. but in what manner
god spake unto them, is not manifest. to say that when [[moses]] went up to
god in mount sinai, it was a [[dream]], or vision, such as other prophets
had, is contrary to that distinction which [[god]] made between [[moses]], and
other prophets [[prophet]], numb. 12. 6,7,8. to say [[god]] spake or appeared as he
is in his own [[nature]], is to deny his infinitenesse, invisibility,
incomprehensibility. to say he spake by inspiration, or infusion of the
holy spirit, as the holy spirit signifieth the deity, is to make moses
equall with [[christ]], in whom onely the godhead (as st. paul speaketh col.
2.9.) dwelleth bodily. and lastly, to say he spake by the holy spirit,
as it signifieth the graces, or gifts of the holy spirit, is to
attribute nothing to him supernaturall. for [[god]] disposeth [[men]] to piety,
justice, [[mercy]], [[truth]], [[faith]], and all manner of vertue, both morall,
and intellectuall, by doctrine, [[example]], and by severall occasions [[occasion]],
naturall, and ordinary.

and as these ways cannot be applyed to [[god]], in his speaking to [[moses]], at
mount sinai; so also, they cannot be applyed to him, in his speaking
to the high priests [[priest]], from the mercy-seat. therefore in what manner god
spake to those soveraign prophets [[prophet]] of the old testament, whose office
it was to enquire of him, is not intelligible. in the [[time]] of the new
testament, there was no soveraign [[prophet]], but our saviour; who was both
god that spake, and the [[prophet]] to whom he spake.

to prophets [[prophet]] of perpetuall calling, but subordinate, [[god]] spake by the
spirit. to subordinate prophets [[prophet]] of perpetuall calling, i find not any
place that proveth [[god]] spake to them supernaturally; but onely in
such manner, as naturally he inclineth [[men]] to piety, to beleef, to
righteousnesse, and to other vertues all other [[christian]] [[men]]. which
way, though it consist in [[constitution]], instruction, [[education]], and the
occasions and invitements [[men]] have to [[christian]] vertues; yet it is truly
attributed to the operation of the spirit of [[god]], or holy spirit
(which we in our [[language]] call the holy ghost): for there is no good
inclination, that is not of the operation of [[god]]. but these operations
are not alwaies supernaturall. when therefore a [[prophet]] is said to speak
in the spirit, or by the spirit of [[god]], we are to [[understand]] no more,
but that he speaks according to gods will, declared by the supreme
prophet. for the most [[common]] acceptation of the word spirit, is in the
signification of a mans [[man]] intention, [[mind]], or disposition.

in the [[time]] of [[moses]], there were seventy [[men]] besides himself, that
prophecyed in the campe of the israelites. in what manner [[god]] spake to
them, is declared in the 11 of numbers, verse 25. "the [[lord]] came down in
a cloud, and spake unto [[moses]], and took of the spirit that was upon him,
and gave it to the seventy elders. and it came to passe, when the spirit
rested upon them, they prophecyed, and did not cease," by which it is
manifest, first, that their prophecying to the [[people]], was subservient,
and subordinate to the prophecying of [[moses]]; for that [[god]] took of the
spirit of [[moses]], to put upon them; so that they prophecyed as moses
would have them: otherwise they had not been [[suffered]] to prophecy at
all. for there was (verse 27.) a complaint made against them to [[moses]];
and joshua would have [[moses]] to have forbidden them; which he did not,
but said to joshua, bee not [[jealous]] in my behalf. secondly, that
the spirit of [[god]] in that place, signifieth nothing but the [[mind]] and
disposition to obey, and assist [[moses]] in the administration of the
government. for if it were meant they had the substantial spirit of [[god]];
that is, the [[divine]] [[nature]], inspired into them, then they had it in no
lesse manner than [[christ]] himself, in whom onely the spirit of [[god]] dwelt
bodily. it is meant therefore of the gift and grace of [[god]], that guided
them to co-operate with [[moses]]; from whom their spirit was derived. and
it appeareth (verse 16.) that, they were such as [[moses]] himself should
appoint for elders and officers of the [[people]]: for the words are,
"gather unto me seventy [[men]], whom thou knowest to be elders and
officers of the [[people]]:" where, "thou knowest," is the same with "thou
appointest," or "hast appointed to be such." for we are told
before (exod. 18.) that [[moses]] following the counsell of jethro his
father-in-law, did appoint judges [[judge]], and officers over the [[people]], such as
feared [[god]]; and of these, were those seventy, whom [[god]] by putting upon
them [[moses]] spirit, inclined to aid [[moses]] in the administration of the
kingdome: and in this sense the spirit of [[god]] is said (1 sam. 16. 13,
14.) presently upon the anointing of [[david]], to have come upon [[david]], and
left saul; [[god]] giving his graces to him he chose to govern his [[people]],
and taking them away from him, he rejected. so that by the spirit is
meant inclination to gods service; and not any supernaturall revelation.




god sometimes also spake by lots

god spake also many times [[time]] by the event of lots; which were ordered by
such as he had put in [[authority]] over his [[people]]. so wee [[read]] that god
manifested by the lots which saul caused to be drawn (1 sam. 14. 43.)
the [[fault]] that jonathan had committed, in eating a honey-comb, contrary
to the oath taken by the [[people]]. and (josh. 18. 10.) [[god]] divided the
land of canaan amongst the israelite, by the "lots that joshua did cast
before the [[lord]] in shiloh." in the same manner it seemeth to be, that
god discovered (joshua 7.16., &c.) the crime of achan. and these are the
wayes whereby [[god]] declared his will in the old testament.

all which ways he used also in the new testament. to the virgin [[mary]], by
a vision of an angel: to joseph in a [[dream]]: again to paul in the way
to damascus in a vision of our saviour: and to peter in the vision of
a sheet let down from [[heaven]], with divers sorts of flesh, of clean and
unclean, beasts; and in prison, by vision of an angel: and to all the
apostles, and writers of the new testament, by the graces of his spirit;
and to the [[apostles]] again (at the choosing of matthias in the place of
judas iscariot) by lot.




every [[man]] ought to examine the probability of a pretended prophets
calling

seeing then all prophecy supposeth vision, or [[dream]], (which two, when
they be naturall, are the same,) or some especiall gift of [[god]], so
rarely observed in [[mankind]], as to be admired where observed; and seeing
as well such gifts, as the most extraordinary dreams [[dream]], and visions, may
proceed from [[god]], not onely by his supernaturall, and immediate, but
also by his naturall operation, and by mediation of second causes;
there is need of [[reason]] and judgement to discern between naturall, and
supernaturall gifts, and between naturall, and supernaturall visions, or
dreams. and consequently [[men]] had need to be very circumspect, and wary,
in obeying the voice of [[man]], that pretending himself to be a [[prophet]],
requires us to obey [[god]] in that way, which he in gods name telleth us to
be the way to happinesse. for he that pretends to [[teach]] [[men]] the way of
so [[great]] felicity, pretends to govern them; that is to say, to [[rule]], and
reign over them; which is a thing, that all [[men]] naturally [[desire]], and
is therefore worthy to be suspected of [[ambition]] and imposture; and
consequently, ought to be examined, and tryed by every [[man]], before hee
yeeld them [[obedience]]; unlesse he have yeelded it them already, in
the institution of a common-wealth; as when the [[prophet]] is the civill
soveraign, or by the civil soveraign authorized. and if this examination
of prophets [[prophet]], and spirits, were not allowed to every one of the [[people]],
it had been to no [[purpose]], to set out the marks, by which every man
might be able, to distinguish between those, whom they ought, and those
whom they ought not to [[follow]]. seeing therefore such marks are set out
(deut. 13. 1,&c.) to [[know]] a [[prophet]] by; and (1 john 4.1.&c) to [[know]] a
spirit by: and seeing there is so much prophecying in the old testament;
and so much preaching in the new testament against prophets [[prophet]]; and so much
greater a number ordinarily of false prophets [[prophet]], then of true; every
one is to beware of obeying their directions, at their own perill. and
first, that there were many more false than true prophets [[prophet]], appears by
this, that when ahab (1 kings [[king]] 12.) consulted four hundred prophets [[prophet]], they
were all false imposters, but onely one michaiah. and a little before
the [[time]] of the captivity, the prophets [[prophet]] were generally lyars. "the
prophets" (saith the [[lord]] by jerem. cha. 14. verse 14.) "prophecy lies
in my name. i sent them not, neither have i commanded them, nor spake
unto them, they prophecy to you a false vision, a thing of naught; and
the deceit of their [[heart]]." in so much as [[god]] commanded the [[people]] by
the mouth of the [[prophet]] jeremiah (chap. 23. 16.) not to obey them.
"thus saith the [[lord]] of hosts, hearken not unto the words of the
prophets, that prophecy to you. they make you [[vain]], they speak a vision
of their own [[heart]], and not out of the mouth of the [[lord]]."




all prophecy but of the soveraign [[prophet]] is to be examined by every
subject

seeing then there was in the [[time]] of the old testament, such quarrells
amongst the visionary prophets [[prophet]], one contesting with another, and asking
when departed the spirit from me, to go to thee? as between michaiah,
and the rest of the four hundred; and such giving of the lye to one
another, (as in jerem. 14.14.) and such controversies in the new
testament at this day, amongst the spirituall prophets [[prophet]]: every [[man]] then
was, and now is bound to make use of his naturall [[reason]], to apply to
all prophecy those rules [[rule]] which [[god]] hath given us, to discern the
true from the false. of which rules [[rule]], in the old testament, one was,
conformable doctrine to that which [[moses]] the soveraign [[prophet]] had
taught them; and the other the miraculous [[power]] of foretelling what god
would bring to passe, as i have already shown out of deut. 13. 1. &c.
and in the new testament there was but one onely mark; and that was the
preaching of this doctrine, that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]], that is, the
king of the [[jews]], promised in the old testament. whosoever denyed that
article, he was a false [[prophet]], whatsoever [[miracles]] he might seem to
work; and he that taught it was a true [[prophet]]. for st. john (1 epist,
4. 2, &c) speaking expressely of the means to examine spirits, whether
they be of [[god]], or not; after he hath told them that there would arise
false prophets [[prophet]], saith thus, "hereby [[know]] ye the spirit of [[god]]. every
spirit that confesseth that [[jesus]] [[christ]] is come in the flesh, is of
god;" that is, is approved and allowed as a [[prophet]] of [[god]]: not that
he is a godly [[man]], or one of the elect, for this, that he confesseth,
professeth, or preacheth [[jesus]] to be the [[christ]]; but for that he is a
prophet avowed. for [[god]] sometimes speaketh by prophets [[prophet]], whose persons [[person]] he
hath not accepted; as he did by baalam; and as he foretold saul of his
death, by the witch of endor. again in the next verse, "every spirit
that confesseth not that [[jesus]] [[christ]] is come in the flesh, is not
of [[christ]]. and this is the spirit of antichrist." so that the [[rule]] is
perfect on both sides; that he is a true [[prophet]], which preacheth the
messiah already come, in the [[person]] of [[jesus]]; and he a false one that
denyeth him come, and looketh for him in some future imposter, that
shall take upon him that [[honour]] falsely, whom the apostle there properly
calleth antichrist. every [[man]] therefore ought to consider who is the
soveraign [[prophet]]; that is to say, who it is, that is gods viceregent
on [[earth]]; and hath next under [[god]], the [[authority]] of governing christian
men; and to observe for a [[rule]], that doctrine, which in the name of
god, hee commanded to bee taught; and thereby to examine and try out
the [[truth]] of those doctrines, which pretended prophets [[prophet]] with [[miracles]], or
without, shall at any [[time]] advance: and if they find it contrary to that
rule, to doe as they did, that came to [[moses]], and complained that there
were some that prophecyed in the campe, whose [[authority]] so to doe they
doubted of; and leave to the soveraign, as they did to [[moses]] to uphold,
or to forbid them, as hee should see cause; and if hee disavow them,
then no more to obey their voice; or if he approve them, then to obey
them, as [[men]] to whom [[god]] hath given a part of the spirit of their
soveraigne. for when [[christian]] [[men]], take not their [[christian]] soveraign,
for gods [[prophet]]; they must either take their owne dreams [[dream]], for the
prophecy they mean to bee governed by, and the tumour of their own
hearts for the spirit of [[god]]; or they must suffer themselves to bee lead
by some [[strange]] [[prince]]; or by some of their fellow subjects [[subject]], that can
bewitch them, by slander of the [[government]], into rebellion, without
other miracle to confirm their calling, then sometimes an extraordinary
successe, and impunity; and by this means destroying all laws [[law]], both
divine, and humane, reduce all order, [[government]], and [[society]], to the
first [[chaos]] of [[violence]], and civill warre.



chapter xxxvii. of [[miracles]], and their use




a miracle is a [[work]] that causeth admiration

by [[miracles]] are signified the admirable works [[work]] of [[god]]: & therefore they
are also called wonders. and because they are for the most part, done,
for a signification of his commandement, in such occasions [[occasion]], as
without them, [[men]] are apt to [[doubt]], (following their private naturall
reasoning,) what he hath commanded, and what not, they are commonly in
holy [[scripture]], called signes, in the same sense, as they are called by
the latines, ostenta, and portenta, from shewing, and fore-signifying
that, which the almighty is about to bring to passe.




and must therefore be rare, whereof there is no naturall cause known

to [[understand]] therefore what is a miracle, we must first [[understand]] what
works they are, which [[men]] wonder at, and call admirable. and there be
but two things which make [[men]] wonder at any event: the one is, if it
be [[strange]], that is to say, such, as the like of it hath never, or very
rarely been produced: the other is, if when it is produced, we cannot
imagine it to have been done by naturall means, but onely by the
immediate hand of [[god]]. but when wee see some possible, naturall cause of
it, how rarely soever the like has been done; or if the like have been
often done, how impossible soever it be to imagine a naturall means
thereof, we no more wonder, nor esteem it for a miracle.

therefore, if a horse, or cow should speak, it were a miracle; because
both the thing is [[strange]], & the naturall cause difficult to imagin: so
also were it, to see a [[strange]] deviation of [[nature]], in the production
of some new shape of a living creature. but when a [[man]], or other animal,
engenders his like, though we [[know]] no more how this is done, than the
other; yet because ’tis usuall, it is no miracle. in like manner, if a
man be metamorphosed into a stone, or into a pillar, it is a miracle;
because [[strange]]: but if a peece of wood be so changed; because we see it
often, it is no miracle: and yet we [[know]] no more, by what operation of
god, the one is brought to passe, than the other.

the first rainbow that was seen in the [[world]], was a miracle, because the
first; and consequently [[strange]]; and served for a sign from [[god]], placed
in [[heaven]], to assure his [[people]], there should be no more an universall
destruction of the [[world]] by water. but at this day, because they
are frequent, they are not [[miracles]], neither to them that [[know]] their
naturall causes, nor to them who [[know]] them not. again, there be many
rare works [[work]] produced by the art [[arts]] of [[man]]: yet when we [[know]] they are done;
because thereby wee [[know]] also the means how they are done, we count them
not for [[miracles]], because not wrought by the immediate hand of [[god]], but
by mediation of humane industry.




that which seemeth a miracle to one [[man]], may seem otherwise to another

furthermore, seeing admiration and wonder, is consequent to the
knowledge and [[experience]], wherewith [[men]] are endued, some more, some
lesse; it followeth, that the same thing, may be a miracle to one, and
not to another. and thence it is, that ignorant, and [[superstitious]] men
make [[great]] wonders of those works [[work]], which other [[men]], knowing to proceed
from [[nature]], (which is not the immediate, but the ordinary [[work]] of [[god]],)
admire not at all: as when ecclipses of the sun and moon have been taken
for supernaturall works [[work]], by the [[common]] [[people]]; when neverthelesse, there
were others, could from their naturall causes, have foretold the very
hour they should arrive: or, as when a [[man]], by confederacy, and secret
intelligence, getting [[knowledge]] of the private actions of an ignorant,
unwary [[man]], thereby tells him, what he has done in former [[time]]; it seems
to him a miraculous thing; but amongst [[wise]], and cautelous [[men]], such
miracles as those, cannot easily be done.




the end of miracles

again, it belongeth to the [[nature]] of a miracle, that it be wrought for
the procuring of credit to gods messengers, ministers, and prophets [[prophet]],
that thereby [[men]] may [[know]], they are called, sent, and employed by [[god]],
and thereby be the [[better]] inclined to obey them. and therefore, though
the creation of the [[world]], and after that the destruction of all living
creatures in the universall deluge, were admirable works [[work]]; yet because
they were not done to procure credit to any [[prophet]], or other minister
of [[god]], they use not to be called [[miracles]]. for how admirable soever any
work be, the admiration consisteth not in that it could be done, because
men naturally beleeve the almighty can doe all things, but because he
does it at the prayer, or word of a [[man]]. but the works [[work]] of [[god]] in [[egypt]],
by the hand of [[moses]], were properly [[miracles]]; because they were done
with intention to make the [[people]] of [[israel]] beleeve, that [[moses]] came
unto them, not out of any design of his owne interest, but as sent from
god. therefore after [[god]] had commanded him to deliver the israelites
from the egyptian bondage, when he said (exod 4.1. &c.) "they will not
beleeve me, but will say, the [[lord]] hath not appeared unto me," [[god]] gave
him [[power]], to turn the rod he had in his hand into a serpent, and again
to return it into a rod; and by putting his hand into his bosome, to
make it leprous; and again by pulling it out to make it whole, to make
the [[children]] of [[israel]] beleeve (as it is verse 5.) that the [[god]] of their
fathers had appeared unto him; and if that were not enough, he gave
him [[power]] to turn their waters into bloud. and when hee had done these
miracles before the [[people]], it is said (verse 41.) that "they beleeved
him." neverthelesse, for [[fear]] of pharaoh, they durst not yet obey him.
therefore the other works [[work]] which were done to plague pharaoh and the
egyptians, tended all to make the israelites beleeve in [[moses]], and were
properly [[miracles]]. in like manner if we consider all the miracles
done by the hand of [[moses]], and all the rest of the prophets [[prophet]], till the
captivity; and those of our saviour, and his [[apostles]] afterward; we
shall find, their end was alwaies to beget, or confirm beleefe, that
they came not of their own motion, but were sent by [[god]]. wee may further
observe in [[scripture]], that the end of [[miracles]], was to beget beleef,
not universally in all [[men]], elect, and reprobate; but in the elect
only; that is to say, is such as [[god]] had determined should become his
subjects. for those miraculous plagues of [[egypt]], had not for end, the
conversion of pharaoh; for [[god]] had told [[moses]] before, that he would
harden the [[heart]] of pharaoh, that he should not let the [[people]] goe: and
when he let them goe at [[last]], not the [[miracles]] perswaded him, but the
plagues forced him to it. so also of our saviour, it is written, (mat.
13. 58.) that he wrought not many [[miracles]] in his own countrey, because
of their unbeleef; and (in marke 6.5.) in stead of, "he wrought not
many," it is, "he could [[work]] none." it was not because he wanted [[power]];
which to say, were blasphemy against [[god]]; nor that the end of miracles
was not to convert incredulous [[men]] to [[christ]]; for the end of all the
miracles of [[moses]], of prophets [[prophet]], of our saviour, and of his apostles
was to adde [[men]] to the [[church]]; but it was, because the end of their
miracles, was to adde to the [[church]] (not all [[men]], but) such as should
be saved; that is to say, such as [[god]] had elected. seeing therefore
our saviour sent from his [[father]], hee could not use his [[power]] in the
conversion of those, whom his [[father]] had rejected. they that expounding
this place of st. marke, say, that his word, "hee could not," is put
for, "he would not," do it without [[example]] in the [[greek]] tongue, (where
would not, is put sometimes for could not, in things inanimate, that
have no will; but could not, for would not, never,) and thereby lay
a stumbling block before [[weak]] christians [[christian]]; as if [[christ]] could doe no
miracles, but amongst the credulous.




the definition of a miracle

from that which i have here set down, of the [[nature]], and use of a
miracle, we may define it thus, "a miracle, is a [[work]] of [[god]], (besides
his operation by the way of [[nature]], ordained in the creation,) done
for the making manifest to his elect, the mission of an extraordinary
minister for their salvation."

and from this definition, we may inferre; first, that in all [[miracles]],
the [[work]] done, is not the effect of any vertue in the [[prophet]]; because
it is the effect of the immediate hand of [[god]]; that is to say [[god]] hath
done it, without using the [[prophet]] therein, as a subordinate cause.

secondly, that no [[devil]], angel, or other created spirit, can do a
miracle. for it must either be by vertue of some naturall [[science]], or
by incantation, that is, vertue of words. for if the inchanters do it
by their own [[power]] independent, there is some [[power]] that proceedeth not
from [[god]]; which all [[men]] deny: and if they doe it by [[power]] given them,
then is the [[work]] not from the immediate hand of [[god]], but naturall, and
consequently no miracle.

there be some texts of [[scripture]], that seem to attribute the [[power]] of
working wonders (equall to some of those immediate [[miracles]], wrought
by [[god]] himself,) to [[certain]] [[arts]] of magick, and incantation. as for
example, when we [[read]] that after the rod of [[moses]] being cast on the
ground became a serpent, (exod. 7. 11.) "the magicians of [[egypt]] did the
like by their enchantments;" and that after [[moses]] had turned the waters
of the egyptian streams, rivers, ponds, and pooles of water into [[blood]],
(exod. 7. 22.) "the magicians of [[egypt]] did so likewise, with their
enchantments;" and that after [[moses]] had by the [[power]] of [[god]] brought
frogs upon the [[land]], (exod. 8. 7.) "the magicians also did so with their
enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the [[land]] of [[egypt]];" will not a
man be apt to attribute [[miracles]] to enchantments; that is to say, to the
efficacy of the sound of words; and [[think]] the same very well proved out
of this, and other such places? and yet there is no place of [[scripture]],
that telleth us what on enchantment is. if therefore enchantment be not,
as many [[think]] it, a working of [[strange]] effects by spells, and words;
but imposture, and delusion, wrought by ordinary means; and so far
from supernaturall, as the impostors need not the study so much as of
naturall causes, but the ordinary ignorance, stupidity, and superstition
of [[mankind]], to doe them; those texts that seem to countenance the power
of magick, witchcraft, and enchantment, must needs have another sense,
than at first sight they seem to bear.




that [[men]] are apt to be deceived by false miracles

for it is evident enough, that words have no effect, but on those
that [[understand]] them; and then they have no other, but to signifie the
intentions, or [[passions]] of them that speak; and thereby [[produce]], [[hope]],
fear, or other [[passions]], or conceptions in the hearer. therefore when a
rod seemeth a serpent, or the water bloud, or any other miracle seemeth
done by enchantment; if it be not to the edification of gods [[people]],
not the rod, nor the water, nor any other thing is enchanted; that is
to say, wrought upon by the words, but the spectator. so that all the
miracle consisteth in this, that the enchanter has deceived a [[man]]; which
is no miracle, but a very easie matter to doe.

for such is the ignorance, and aptitude to error generally of all [[men]],
but especially of them that have not much [[knowledge]] of naturall causes,
and of the [[nature]], and interests of [[men]]; as by innumerable and easie
tricks to be abused. what [[opinion]] of miraculous [[power]], before it was
known there was a [[science]] of the course of the stars, might a [[man]] have
gained, that should have told the [[people]], this hour, or day the sun
should be darkned? a juggler by the handling of his goblets, and other
trinkets, if it were not now ordinarily practised, would be thought
to do his wonders by the [[power]] at least of the [[devil]]. a [[man]] that hath
practised to speak by drawing in of his breath, (which [[kind]] of [[men]] in
antient [[time]] were called ventriloqui,) and so make the weaknesse of
his voice seem to proceed, not from the [[weak]] impulsion of the organs
of [[speech]], but from distance of place, is able to make very many men
beleeve it is a voice from [[heaven]], whatsoever he please to tell them.
and for a crafty [[man]], that hath enquired into the secrets, and familiar
confessions that one [[man]] ordinarily maketh to another of his actions and
adventures [[past]], to tell them him again is no hard matter; and yet there
be many, that by such means as that, obtain the [[reputation]] of being
conjurers. but it is too long a businesse, to reckon up the severall
sorts of those [[men]], which the greeks [[greek]] called thaumaturgi, that is to say,
workers of things wonderfull; and yet these do all they do, by their
own [[single]] dexterity. but if we looke upon the impostures wrought by
confederacy, there is nothing how impossible soever to be done, that is
impossible to bee beleeved. for two [[men]] conspiring, one to seem lame,
the other to cure him with a charme, will [[deceive]] many: but many
conspiring, one to seem lame, another so to cure him, and all the rest
to bear witnesse; will [[deceive]] many more.




cautions against the imposture of miracles

in this aptitude of [[mankind]], to give too hasty beleefe to pretended
miracles, there can be no [[better]], nor i [[think]] any other caution, than
that which [[god]] hath prescribed, first by [[moses]], (as i have said before
in the precedent [[chapter]],) in the beginning of the 13. and end of the
18. of deuteronomy; that wee take not any for prophets [[prophet]], that [[teach]] any
other [[religion]], then that which gods lieutenant, (which at that [[time]] was
moses,) hath established; nor any, (though he [[teach]] the same [[religion]],)
whose praediction we doe not see come to passe. [[moses]] therefore in his
time, and aaron, and his successors in their times [[time]], and the soveraign
governour of gods [[people]], next under [[god]] himself, that is to say, the
head of the [[church]] in all times [[time]], are to be consulted, what doctrine
he hath established, before wee give credit to a pretended miracle, or
prophet. and when that is done, the thing they pretend to be a miracle,
we must both see it done, and use all means possible to consider,
whether it be really done; and not onely so, but whether it be such, as
no [[man]] can do the like by his naturall [[power]], but that it requires the
immediate hand of [[god]]. and in this also we must have recourse to gods
lieutenant; to whom in all doubtfull cases, wee have submitted our
private judgments [[judgment]]. for [[example]]; if a [[man]] pretend, that after certain
words spoken over a peece of bread, that presently [[god]] hath made it not
bread, but a [[god]], or a [[man]], or both, and neverthelesse it looketh still
as like bread as ever it did; there is no [[reason]] for any [[man]] to think
it really done; nor consequently to [[fear]] him, till he enquire of [[god]],
by his vicar, or lieutenant, whether it be done, or not. if he say not,
then followeth that which [[moses]] saith, (deut. 18. 22.) "he hath spoken
it presumptuously, thou shalt not [[fear]] him." if he say ’tis done, then
he is not to contradict it. so also if wee see not, but onely hear tell
of a miracle, we are to consult the lawful [[church]]; that is to say, the
lawful head thereof, how far we are to give credit to the relators of
it. and this is chiefly the case of [[men]], that in these days [[live]] under
christian soveraigns. for in these times [[time]], i do not [[know]] one [[man]], that
ever saw any such wondrous [[work]], done by the charm, or at the word,
or prayer of a [[man]], that a [[man]] endued but with a mediocrity of [[reason]],
would [[think]] supernaturall: and the [[question]] is no more, whether what wee
see done, be a miracle; whether the miracle we hear, or [[read]] of, were
a reall [[work]], and not the act of a tongue, or pen; but in plain terms,
whether the report be true, or a lye. in which [[question]] we are not every
one, to make our own private [[reason]], or [[conscience]], but the publique
reason, that is, the [[reason]] of gods supreme lieutenant, [[judge]]; and
indeed we have made him [[judge]] already, if wee have given him a soveraign
power, to doe all that is necessary for our [[peace]] and defence. a private
man has alwaies the [[liberty]], (because [[thought]] is [[free]],) to beleeve,
or not beleeve in his [[heart]], those acts that have been given out for
miracles, according as he shall see, what benefit can accrew by
mens [[belief]], to those that pretend, or countenance them, and thereby
conjecture, whether they be [[miracles]], or lies [[lie]]. but when it comes
to [[confession]] of that [[faith]], the private [[reason]] must submit to the
publique; that is to say, to gods lieutenant. but who is this lieutenant
of [[god]], and head of the [[church]], shall be considered in its proper place
thereafter.



chapter xxxviii. of the signification in [[scripture]] of eternall [[life]],
hell, salvation, the [[world]] to come, and redemption


the maintenance of civill [[society]], depending on [[justice]]; and [[justice]] on
the [[power]] of [[life]] and [[death]], and other lesse rewards [[reward]] and punishments [[punishment]],
residing in them that have the soveraignty of the common-wealth; it
is impossible a common-wealth should stand, where any other than the
soveraign, hath a [[power]] of giving greater rewards [[reward]] than [[life]]; and of
inflicting greater punishments [[punishment]] than [[death]]. now seeing eternall [[life]] is
a greater [[reward]], than the [[life]] [[present]]; and eternall torment a greater
punishment than the [[death]] of [[nature]]; it is a thing worthy to be well
considered, of all [[men]] that [[desire]] (by obeying authority) to avoid
the calamities of confusion, and civill [[war]], what is meant in holy
scripture, by [[life]] eternall, and torment eternall; and for what
offences, against whom committed, [[men]] are to be eternally tormented; and
for what actions, they are to obtain eternall [[life]].




place of adams eternity if he had not sinned, the terrestrial paradise

and first we find, that adam was created in such a condition of [[life]],
as had he not broken the commandement of [[god]], he had enjoyed it in the
paradise of eden everlastingly. for there was the tree of [[life]]; whereof
he was so long allowed to [[eat]], as he should forbear to [[eat]] of the tree
of [[knowledge]] of [[good]] an evill; which was not allowed him. and therefore
as soon as he had eaten of it, [[god]] thrust him out of paradise, "lest he
should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of [[life]], and live
for ever." (gen. 3. 22.) by which it seemeth to me, (with submission
neverthelesse both in this, and in all questions [[question]], whereof the
determination dependeth on the scriptures [[scripture]], to the interpretation of the
bible authorized by the common-wealth, whose [[subject]] i am,) that adam if
he had not sinned, had had an eternall [[life]] on [[earth]]: and that mortality
entred upon himself, and his [[posterity]], by his first [[sin]]. not that
actuall [[death]] then entred; for adam then could never have had [[children]];
whereas he lived long after, and saw a numerous [[posterity]] ere he dyed.
but where it is said, "in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt
surely [[die]]," it must needs bee meant of his [[mortality]], and certitude
of [[death]]. seeing then eternall [[life]] was lost by adams forfeiture, in
committing [[sin]], he that should cancell that forfeiture was to recover
thereby, that [[life]] again. now [[jesus]] [[christ]] hath satisfied for the sins
of all that beleeve in him; and therefore recovered to all beleevers,
that eternall [[life]], which was lost by the [[sin]] of adam. and in this sense
it is, that the comparison of st. paul holdeth (rom. 5.18, 19.) "as by
the offence of one, [[judgment]] came upon all [[men]] to condemnation, even
so by the righteousnesse of one, the [[free]] gift came upon all men
to justification of [[life]]." which is again (1 cor. 15.21,22) more
perspicuously delivered in these words, "for since by [[man]] came [[death]], by
man came also the resurrection of the [[dead]]. for as in adam all [[die]], even
so in [[christ]] shall all be made alive."




texts concerning the place of [[life]] eternall for beleevers

concerning the place wherein [[men]] shall enjoy that eternall [[life]], which
christ hath obtained for them, the texts next before alledged seem to
make it on [[earth]]. for if as in adam, all [[die]], that is, have forfeited
paradise, and eternall [[life]] on [[earth]]; even so in [[christ]] all shall be
made alive; then all [[men]] shall be made to [[live]] on [[earth]]; for else
the comparison were not proper. hereunto seemeth to agree that of the
psalmist, (psal. 133.3.) "upon zion [[god]] commanded the blessing, even
life for evermore;" for zion, is in [[jerusalem]], upon [[earth]]: as also that
of s. joh. (rev. 2.7.) "to him that overcommeth i will give to [[eat]] of
the tree of [[life]], which is in the midst of the paradise of [[god]]." this
was the tree of adams eternall [[life]]; but his [[life]] was to have been on
earth. the same seemeth to be confirmed again by st. joh. (rev. 21.2.)
where he saith, "i john saw the holy [[city]], new [[jerusalem]], coming down
from [[god]] out of [[heaven]], prepared as a bride adorned for her husband:"
and again v. 10. to the same effect: as if he should say, the new
jerusalem, the paradise of [[god]], at the coming again of [[christ]], should
come down to gods [[people]] from [[heaven]], and not they goe up to it from
earth. and this differs nothing from that, which the two [[men]] in white
clothing (that is, the two angels) said to the [[apostles]], that were
looking upon [[christ]] ascending (acts 1.11.) "this same [[jesus]], who is
taken up from you into [[heaven]], shall so come, as you have seen him go up
into [[heaven]]." which soundeth as if they had said, he should come down
to govern them under his [[father]], eternally here; and not take them up
to govern them in [[heaven]]; and is conformable to the restauration of the
kingdom of [[god]], instituted under [[moses]]; which was a [[political]] government
of the [[jews]] on [[earth]]. again, that saying of our saviour (mat. 22.30.)
"that in the resurrection they neither [[marry]], nor are given in [[marriage]],
but are as the angels of [[god]] in [[heaven]]," is a description of an eternall
life, resembling that which we lost in adam in the point of [[marriage]].
for seeing adam, and eve, if they had not sinned, had lived on earth
eternally, in their individuall persons [[person]]; it is manifest, they should
not continually have procreated their [[kind]]. for if immortals [[immortal]] should have
generated, as [[mankind]] doth now; the [[earth]] in a small [[time]], would not
have been able to afford them a place to stand on. the [[jews]] that asked
our saviour the [[question]], whose [[wife]] the woman that had [[married]] many
brothers, should be, in the resurrection, knew not what were the
consequences of immortality; that there shal be no [[generation]], and
consequently no [[marriage]], no more than there is [[marriage]], or generation
among the angels. the comparison between that eternall [[life]] which adam
lost, and our saviour by his [[victory]] over [[death]] hath recovered; holdeth
also in this, that as adam lost eternall [[life]] by his [[sin]], and yet lived
after it for a [[time]]; so the faithful [[christian]] hath recovered eternal
life by christs passion, though he [[die]] a [[natural]] [[death]], and remaine dead
for a [[time]]; namely, till the resurrection. for as [[death]] is reckoned from
the condemnation of adam, not from the execution; so [[life]] is reckoned
from the absolution, not from the resurrection of them that are elected
in [[christ]].




ascension into heaven

that the place wherein [[men]] are to [[live]] eternally, after the
resurrection, is the heavens [[heaven]], meaning by [[heaven]], those parts of the
world, which are the most remote from [[earth]], as where the stars are,
or above the stars, in another higher [[heaven]], called caelum empyreum,
(whereof there is no mention in [[scripture]], nor ground in reason) is not
easily to be drawn from any text that i can find. by the kingdome of
heaven, is meant the kingdome of the [[king]] that dwelleth in [[heaven]]; and
his kingdome was the [[people]] of [[israel]], whom he ruled by the prophets
his lieutenants, first [[moses]], and after him eleazar, and the soveraign
priests, till in the days of samuel they rebelled, and would have a
mortall [[man]] for their [[king]], after the manner of other nations. and
when our saviour [[christ]], by the preaching of his ministers, shall have
perswaded the [[jews]] to return, and called the gentiles to his [[obedience]],
then shall there be a new kingdome of [[heaven]], because our [[king]] shall
then be [[god]], whose [[throne]] is [[heaven]]; without any necessity evident in
the [[scripture]], that [[man]] shall ascend to his happinesse any higher than
gods footstool the [[earth]]. on the contrary, we find written (joh. 3.13.)
that "no [[man]] hath ascended into [[heaven]], but he that came down from
heaven, even the [[son]] of [[man]], that is in [[heaven]]." where i observe by the
way, that these words are not, as those which go immediately before, the
words of our saviour, but of st. john himself; for [[christ]] was then not
in [[heaven]], but upon the [[earth]]. the like is said of [[david]] (acts 2.34.)
where st. peter, to prove the ascension of [[christ]], using the words of
the psalmist, (psal. 16.10.) "thou wilt not leave my soule in hell, nor
suffer thine holy one to see [[corruption]]," saith, they were spoken (not
of [[david]], but) of [[christ]]; and to prove it, addeth this [[reason]], "for
david is not ascended into [[heaven]]." but to this a [[man]] may easily [[answer]],
and say, that though their bodies [[body]] were not to ascend till the generall
day of [[judgment]], yet their souls [[soul]] were in [[heaven]] as soon as they were
departed from their bodies [[body]]; which also seemeth to be confirmed by the
words of our saviour (luke 20.37,38.) who proving the resurrection out
of the word of [[moses]], saith thus, "that the [[dead]] are raised, even moses
shewed, at the bush, when he calleth the [[lord]], the [[god]] of [[abraham]], and
the [[god]] of isaac, and the [[god]] of jacob. for he is not a [[god]] of the [[dead]],
but of the living; for they all [[live]] to him." but if these words be to
be understood only of the immortality of the [[soul]], they prove not at all
that which our saviour intended to prove, which was the resurrection
of the [[body]], that is to say, the immortality of the [[man]]. therefore our
saviour meaneth, that those patriarchs were immortall; not by a property
consequent to the essence, and [[nature]] of [[mankind]], but by the will of
god, that was pleased of his mere grace, to bestow eternall [[life]] upon
the faithfull. and though at that [[time]] the patriarchs and many other
faithfull [[men]] were [[dead]], yet as it is in the text, they lived to [[god]];
that is, they were written in the [[book]] of [[life]] with them that were
absolved of their sinnes, and ordained to [[life]] eternall at the
resurrection. that the [[soul]] of [[man]] is in its own [[nature]] eternall, and
a living creature independent on the [[body]]; or that any meer [[man]] is
immortall, otherwise than by the resurrection in the [[last]] day, (except
enos and elias,) is a doctrine not apparent in [[scripture]]. the whole 14.
chapter of [[job]], which is the [[speech]] not of his [[friends]], but of himselfe,
is a complaint of this [[mortality]] of [[nature]]; and yet no contradiction of
the immortality at the resurrection. "there is [[hope]] of a tree," (saith
hee verse 7.) "if it be cast down, though the root thereof wax old, and
the stock thereof [[die]] in the ground, yet when it scenteth the water
it will bud, and bring forth boughes like a plant. but [[man]] dyeth, and
wasteth away, yea, [[man]] giveth up the ghost, and where is he?" and (verse
12.) "man lyeth down, and riseth not, till the heavens [[heaven]] be no more." but
when is it, that the heavens [[heaven]] shall be no more? st. peter tells us, that
it is at the generall resurrection. for in his 2. epistle, 3. [[chapter]],
and 7. verse, he saith, that "the heavens [[heaven]] and the [[earth]] that are now,
are reserved unto [[fire]] against the day of [[judgment]], and perdition of
ungodly [[men]]," and (verse 12.) "looking for, and hasting to the comming
of [[god]], wherein the heavens [[heaven]] shall be on [[fire]], and shall be dissolved,
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. neverthelesse, we
according to the promise look for new heavens [[heaven]], and a new [[earth]], wherein
dwelleth righteousnesse." therefore where [[job]] saith, [[man]] riseth not till
the heavens [[heaven]] be no more; it is all one, as if he had said, the immortall
life (and soule and [[life]] in the [[scripture]], do usually signifie the same
thing) beginneth not in [[man]], till the resurrection, and day of [[judgment]];
and hath for cause, not his specificall [[nature]], and [[generation]]; but the
promise. for st. peter saies not, "wee look for new heavens [[heaven]], and a new
earth, (from nature) but from promise."

lastly, seeing it hath been already proved out of divers evident places
of [[scripture]], in the 35. [[chapter]] of this [[book]], that the [[kingdom]] of god
is a civil common-wealth, where [[god]] himself is soveraign, by vertue
first of the old, and since of the new covenant, wherein he reigneth by
his vicar, or lieutenant; the same places do therefore also prove, that
after the comming again of our saviour in his majesty, and [[glory]], to
reign actually, and eternally; the [[kingdom]] of [[god]] is to be on [[earth]]. but
because this doctrine (though proved out of places of [[scripture]] not few,
nor obscure) will appear to most [[men]] a novelty; i doe but propound
it; maintaining nothing in this, or any other paradox of [[religion]];
but attending the end of that dispute of the [[sword]], concerning the
authority, (not yet amongst my countrey-men decided,) by which all sorts
of doctrine are to bee approved, or rejected; and whose commands, both
in [[speech]], and writing, (whatsoever be the opinions [[opinion]] of private men) must
by all [[men]], that mean to be protected by their laws [[law]], be obeyed. for
the points of doctrine concerning the kingdome (of) [[god]], have so great
influence on the kingdome of [[man]], as not to be determined, but by them,
that under [[god]] have the soveraign [[power]].




the place after [[judgment]], of those who were never in the kingdome of
god, or having been in, are cast out

as the kingdome of [[god]], and eternall [[life]], so also gods enemies [[enemy]], and
their torments after [[judgment]], appear by the [[scripture]], to have their
place on [[earth]]. the name of the place, where all [[men]] remain till the
resurrection, that were either buryed, or swallowed up of the [[earth]], is
usually called in [[scripture]], by words that signifie under ground; which
the latines [[read]] generally infernus, and inferni, and the greeks [[greek]] [[hades]];
that is to say, a place where [[men]] cannot see; and containeth as well the
grave, as any other deeper place. but for the place of the damned after
the resurrection, it is not determined, neither in the old, nor new
testament, by any note of situation; but onely by the company: as that
it shall bee, where such wicked [[men]] were, as [[god]] in former times [[time]] in
extraordinary, and miraculous manner, had destroyed from off the face of
the [[earth]]: as for [[example]], that they are in inferno, in tartarus, or in
the bottomelesse pit; because corah, dathan, and abirom, were swallowed
up alive into the [[earth]]. not that the writers of the [[scripture]] would
have us beleeve, there could be in the globe of the [[earth]], which is
not only finite, but also (compared to the height of the stars) of no
considerable magnitude, a pit without a bottome; that is, a hole of
infinite depth, such as the greeks [[greek]] in their daemonologie (that is to
say, in their doctrine concerning daemons,) and after them, the romans
called tartarus; of which virgill sayes,

    bis patet in præceps, tantem tendítque sub umbras,
    quantus ad æthereum cœli suspectus olympum:

for that is a thing the proportion of [[earth]] to [[heaven]] cannot bear: but
that wee should beleeve them there, indefinitely, where those [[men]] are,
on whom [[god]] inflicted that exemplary punnishment.




the congregation of giants

again, because those mighty [[men]] of the [[earth]], that lived in the time
of noah, before the floud, (which the greeks [[greek]] called heroes, and the
scripture giants, and both say, were begotten, by copulation of the
children of [[god]], with the [[children]] of [[men]],) were for their wicked life
destroyed by the generall deluge; the place of the damned, is therefore
also sometimes marked out, by the company of those deceased giants; as
proverbs 21.16. "the [[man]] that wandreth out of the way of understanding,
shall remain in the congregation of the giants," and [[job]] 26.5. "behold
the giants groan under water, and they that dwell with them." here
the place of the damned, is under the water. and isaiah 14.9. "hell is
troubled how to meet thee," (that is, the [[king]] of babylon) "and will
displace the giants for thee:" and here again the place of the damned,
(if the sense be literall,) is to be under water.




lake of fire

thirdly, because the cities [[city]] of sodom, and gomorrah, by the extraordinary
wrath of [[god]], were consumed for their wickednesse with [[fire]] and
brimstone, and together with them the countrey about made a stinking
bituminous lake; the place of the damned is sometimes expressed by
fire, and a fiery lake: as in the apocalypse ch.21.8. "but the timorous,
incredulous, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and
sorcerers, and idolators, and all lyars, shall have their part in the
lake that burneth with [[fire]], and brimstone; which is the second [[death]]."
so that it is manifest, that hell [[fire]], which is here expressed by
metaphor, from the reall [[fire]] of sodome, signifieth not any certain
kind, or place of torment; but is to be taken indefinitely, for
destruction, as it is in the 20. [[chapter]], at the 14. verse; where it is
said, that "death and hell were cast into the lake of [[fire]];" that is
to say, were abolished, and destroyed; as if after the day of [[judgment]],
there shall be no more dying, nor no more going into hell; that is, no
more going to [[hades]] (from which word perhaps our word hell is derived,)
which is the same with no more dying.




utter darknesse

fourthly, from the plague of darknesse inflicted on the [[egyptians]], of
which it is written (exod. 10.23.) "they saw not one another, neither
rose any [[man]] from his place for three days; but all the [[children]] of
israel had [[light]] in their dwellings;" the place of the wicked after
judgment, is called utter darknesse, or (as it is in the originall)
darknesse without. and so it is expressed (mat. 22.13.) where the king
commandeth his servants, "to bind hand and foot the [[man]] that had not
on his wedding garment, and to cast him out," eis to skotos to exoteron,
externall darknesse, or darknesse without: which though translated utter
darknesse, does not signifie how [[great]], but where that darknesse is to
be; namely, without the habitation of gods elect.




gehenna, and tophet

lastly, whereas there was a place neer [[jerusalem]], called the valley of
the [[children]] of hinnon; in a part whereof, called tophet, the [[jews]] had
committed most grievous idolatry, sacrificing their [[children]] to the
idol moloch; and wherein also [[god]] had afflicted his enemies [[enemy]] with most
grievous punishments [[punishment]]; and wherein josias had burnt the priests [[priest]] of moloch
upon their own altars, as appeareth at large in the 2 of kings [[king]] chap. 23.
the place served afterwards, to receive the filth, and garbage which was
carried thither, out of the [[city]]; and there used to be fires [[fire]] made, from
time to [[time]], to purifie the aire, and take away the stench of carrion.
from this abominable place, the [[jews]] used ever after to call the place
of the damned, by the name of gehenna, or valley of hinnon. and this
gehenna, is that word, which is usually now translated hell; and
from the fires [[fire]] from [[time]] to [[time]] there burning, we have the notion of
everlasting, and unquenchable [[fire]].




of the literall sense of the [[scripture]] concerning hell

seeing now there is none, that so interprets the [[scripture]], as that
after the day of [[judgment]], the wicked are all eternally to be punished
in the valley of hinnon; or that they shall so rise again, as to be ever
after under ground, or under water; or that after the resurrection, they
shall no more see one another; nor stir from one place to another; it
followeth, me thinks [[think]], very necessarily, that that which is thus said
concerning hell [[fire]], is spoken metaphorically; and that therefore there
is a proper sense to bee enquired after, (for of all metaphors there is
some reall ground, that may be expressed in proper words) both of the
place of hell, and the [[nature]] of hellish torment, and tormenters.




satan, devill, not proper names, but appellatives

and first for the tormenters, wee have their [[nature]], and properties [[property]],
exactly and properly delivered by the names of, the [[enemy]], or [[satan]];
the accuser, or diabolus; the destroyer, or abbadon. which significant
names, [[satan]], devill, abbadon, set not forth to us any individuall
person, as proper names use to doe; but onely an office, or quality;
and are therefore appellatives; which ought not to have been left
untranslated, as they are, in the latine, and [[modern]] bibles; because
thereby they seem to be the proper names of daemons; and [[men]] are the
more easily seduced to beleeve the doctrine of devills; which at that
time was the [[religion]] of the gentiles, and contrary to that of [[moses]],
and of [[christ]].

and because by the [[enemy]], the accuser, and destroyer, is meant, the
enemy of them that shall be in the kingdome of [[god]]; therefore if the
kingdome of [[god]] after the resurrection, bee upon the [[earth]], (as in the
former [[chapter]] i have shewn by [[scripture]] it seems to be,) the [[enemy]],
and his kingdome must be on [[earth]] also. for so also was it, in the time
before the [[jews]] had deposed [[god]]. for gods kingdome was in palestine;
and the nations round about, were the kingdomes of the [[enemy]]; and
consequently by [[satan]], is meant any earthly [[enemy]] of the [[church]].




torments of hell

the torments of hell, are expressed sometimes, by "weeping, and gnashing
of teeth," as mat. 8.12. sometimes, by "the worm of [[conscience]];" as
isa.66.24. and mark 9.44, 46, 48; sometimes, by [[fire]], as in the place
now quoted, "where the worm dyeth not, and the [[fire]] is not quenched,"
and many places beside: sometimes by "shame, and contempt," as dan.
12.2. "and many of them that sleep in the dust of the [[earth]], shall
awake; some to everlasting [[life]]; and some to shame, and everlasting
contempt." all which places design metaphorically a [[grief]], and
discontent of [[mind]], from the sight of that eternall felicity in others,
which they themselves through their own incredulity, and disobedience
have lost. and because such felicity in others, is not sensible but by
comparison with their own actuall miseries; it followeth that they are
to suffer such bodily paines, and calamities, as are incident to those,
who not onely [[live]] under evill and cruell governours, but have also for
enemy, the eternall [[king]] of the saints, [[god]] almighty. and amongst these
bodily paines, is to be reckoned also to every one of the wicked a
second [[death]]. for though the [[scripture]] bee clear for an universall
resurrection; yet wee do not [[read]], that to any of the reprobate is
promised an eternall [[life]]. for whereas st. paul (1 cor. 15.42, 43.) to
the [[question]] concerning what bodies [[body]] [[men]] shall rise with again, saith,
that "the [[body]] is sown in [[corruption]], and is raised in incorruption; it
is sown in dishonour, it is raised in [[glory]]; it is sown in weaknesse, it
is raised in [[power]];" [[glory]] and [[power]] cannot be applyed to the bodies [[body]] of
the wicked: nor can the name of second [[death]], bee applyed to those
that can never [[die]] but once: and although in metaphoricall [[speech]], a
calamitous [[life]] everlasting, may bee called an everlasting [[death]] yet it
cannot well be understood of a second [[death]]. the [[fire]] prepared for the
wicked, is an everlasting [[fire]]: that is to say, the estate wherein
no [[man]] can be without torture, both of [[body]] and [[mind]], after the
resurrection, shall endure for ever; and in that sense the [[fire]] shall
be unquenchable, and the torments everlasting: but it cannot thence be
inferred, that hee who shall be cast into that [[fire]], or be tormented
with those torments, shall endure, and resist them so, as to be
eternally burnt, and tortured, and yet never be destroyed, nor [[die]]. and
though there be many places that affirm everlasting [[fire]], and torments
(into which [[men]] may be cast successively one after another for ever;)
yet i find none that affirm there shall bee an eternall [[life]] therein of
any individuall [[person]]; but on the contrary, an everlasting [[death]], which
is the second [[death]]: (apoc. 20. 13,14.) "for after [[death]], and the grave
shall have delivered up the [[dead]] which were in them, and every [[man]] be
judged according to his works [[work]]; [[death]] and the grave shall also be cast
into the lake of [[fire]]. this is the second [[death]]." whereby it is
evident, that there is to bee a second [[death]] of every one that shall bee
condemned at the day of judgement, after which hee shall [[die]] no more.




the joyes of [[life]] eternall, and salvation the same thing,
salvation from [[sin]], and from misery, all one

the joyes of [[life]] eternall, are in [[scripture]] comprehended all under the
name of salvation, or being saved. to be saved, is to be secured, either
respectively, against speciall evills, or absolutely against all evill,
comprehending want, sicknesse, and [[death]] it [[self]]. and because man
was created in a condition immortall, not [[subject]] to [[corruption]], and
consequently to nothing that tendeth to the dissolution of his [[nature]];
and fell from that happinesse by the [[sin]] of adam; it followeth, that
to be saved from [[sin]], is to be saved from all the evill, and calamities
that sinne hath brought upon us. and therefore in the holy [[scripture]],
remission of sinne, and salvation from [[death]] and misery, is the same
thing, as it appears by the words of our saviour, who having cured a man
sick of the palsey, by saying, (mat. 9.2.) "son be of [[good]] cheer, thy
sins be forgiven thee;" and knowing that the scribes took for blasphemy,
that a [[man]] should pretend to [[forgive]] sins [[sin]], [[asked]] them (v.5.) "whether
it were easier to say, thy sinnes be forgiven thee, or, arise and walk;"
signifying thereby, that it was all one, as to the saving of the sick,
to say, "thy sins [[sin]] are forgiven," and "arise and walk;" and that he used
that form of [[speech]], onely to shew he had [[power]] to [[forgive]] sins [[sin]]. and
it is besides evident in [[reason]], that since [[death]] and misery, were the
punishments of [[sin]], the discharge of sinne, must also be a discharge
of [[death]] and misery; that is to say, salvation absolute, such as the
faithfull are to enjoy after the day of [[judgment]], by the [[power]], and
favour of [[jesus]] [[christ]], who for that cause is called our saviour.

concerning particular salvations, such as are understood, 1 sam. 14.39.
"as the [[lord]] liveth that saveth [[israel]]," that is, from their temporary
enemies, and 2 sam. 22.4. "thou art [[arts]] my saviour, thou savest me from
violence;" and 2 kings [[king]] 13.5. "god gave the israelites a saviour, and
so they were delivered from the hand of the assyrians," and the like,
i need say nothing; there being neither difficulty, nor interest, to
corrupt the interpretation of texts of that [[kind]].




the place of eternall salvation

but concerning the generall salvation, because it must be in the
kingdome of [[heaven]], there is [[great]] difficulty concerning the place.
on one side, by kingdome (which is an estate ordained by [[men]] for their
perpetuall security against enemies [[enemy]], and want) it seemeth that this
salvation should be on [[earth]]. for by salvation is set forth unto us,
a glorious reign of our [[king]], by [[conquest]]; not a safety by escape:
and therefore there where we look for salvation, we must look also
for triumph; and before triumph, for [[victory]]; and before [[victory]], for
battell; which cannot well be supposed, shall be in [[heaven]]. but how good
soever this [[reason]] may be, i will not trust to it, without very evident
places of [[scripture]]. the [[state]] of salvation is described at large,
isaiah, 33. ver. 20,21,22,23,24.

"look upon zion, the [[city]] of our solemnities, thine [[eyes]] shall see
jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down;
not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any
of the cords thereof be broken.

but there the glorious [[lord]] will be unto us a place of broad rivers, and
streams; wherein shall goe no gally with oares; neither shall gallant
ship passe thereby.

for the [[lord]] is our [[judge]], the [[lord]] is our lawgiver, the [[lord]] is our
king, he will save us.

thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast;
they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a [[great]] spoil
divided; the lame take the prey.

and the inhabitant shall not say, i am sicke; the [[people]] that shall
dwell therein shall be forgiven their [[iniquity]]."

in which words wee have the place from whence salvation is to proceed,
"jerusalem, a quiet habitation;" the eternity of it, "a tabernacle that
shall not be taken down," &c. the saviour of it, "the [[lord]], their [[judge]],
their lawgiver, their [[king]], he will save us;" the salvation, "the lord
shall be to them as a broad mote of swift waters," &c. the condition of
their enemies [[enemy]], "their tacklings are loose, their masts weake, the
lame shal take the spoil of them." the condition of the saved,
"the inhabitants shall not say, i am sick:" and lastly, all this is
comprehended in forgivenesse of [[sin]], "the [[people]] that dwell therein
shall be forgiven their [[iniquity]]." by which it is evident, that
salvation shall be on [[earth]], then, when [[god]] shall reign, (at the coming
again of christ) in [[jerusalem]]; and from [[jerusalem]] shall proceed the
salvation of the gentiles that shall be received into gods kingdome; as
is also more expressely declared by the same [[prophet]], chap. 66.20, 21.
"and they," (that is, the gentiles who had any jew in bondage) "shall
bring all your brethren [[brother]], for an offering to the [[lord]], out of all
nations, upon horses, and in charets, and in litters, and upon mules,
and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain, [[jerusalem]], saith the [[lord]],
as the [[children]] of [[israel]] bring an offering in a clean vessell into
the house of the [[lord]]. and i will also take of them for priests [[priest]] and for
levites, saith the [[lord]]:" whereby it is manifest, that the [[chief]] seat of
gods kingdome (which is the place, from whence the salvation of us that
were gentiles, shall proceed) shall be [[jerusalem]]; and the same is also
confirmed by our saviour, in his discourse with the woman of samaria,
concerning the place of gods [[worship]]; to whom he saith, john 4.22. that
the samaritans worshipped they [[know]] not what, but the [[jews]] [[worship]] what
they knew, "for salvation is of the [[jews]] (ex judais, that is, begins at
the jews): as if he should say, you [[worship]] [[god]], but [[know]] not by whom
he wil save you, as we doe, that [[know]] it shall be one of the tribe
of judah, a jew, not a samaritan. and therefore also the woman not
impertinently answered him again, "we [[know]] the messias shall come." so
that which our saviour saith, "salvation is from the [[jews]]," is the
same that paul sayes (rom. 1.16,17.) "the gospel is the [[power]] of [[god]] to
salvation to every one that beleeveth; to the jew first, and also to the
greek. for therein is the righteousnesse of [[god]] revealed from [[faith]] to
faith;" from the [[faith]] of the jew, to the [[faith]] of the gentile. in
the like sense the [[prophet]] joel describing the day of [[judgment]], (chap.
2.30,31.) that [[god]] would "shew wonders in [[heaven]], and in [[earth]], bloud,
and [[fire]], and pillars of smoak. the sun should be turned to darknesse,
and the moon into bloud, before the [[great]] and terrible day of the lord
come," he addeth verse 32. "and it shall come to passe, that whosoever
shall call upon the name of the [[lord]], shall be saved. for in mount zion,
and in [[jerusalem]] shall be salvation." and obadiah verse 17 saith
the same, "upon mount zion shall be deliverance; and there shall be
holinesse, and the house of jacob shall possesse their possessions,"
that is, the possessions of the heathen, which possessions he expresseth
more particularly in the following verses, by the mount of esau, the
land of the philistines, the fields of ephraim, of samaria, gilead, and
the cities [[city]] of the south, and concludes with these words, "the kingdom
shall be the lords [[lord]]." all these places are for salvation, and the
kingdome of [[god]] (after the day of judgement) upon [[earth]]. on the other
side, i have not found any text that can probably be drawn, to prove
any ascension of the saints into [[heaven]]; that is to say, into any coelum
empyreum, or other aetheriall region; saving that it is called the
kingdome of [[heaven]]; which name it may have, because [[god]], that was king
of the [[jews]], governed them by his commands, sent to [[moses]] by angels from
heaven, to reduce them to their [[obedience]]; and shall send him thence
again, to [[rule]] both them, and all other faithfull [[men]], from the day of
judgment, everlastingly: or from that, that the [[throne]] of this our great
king is in [[heaven]]; whereas the [[earth]] is but his footstoole. but that the
subjects of [[god]] should have any place as high as his [[throne]], or higher
than his footstoole, it seemeth not sutable to the [[dignity]] of a [[king]],
nor can i find any evident text for it in holy [[scripture]].

from this that hath been said of the [[kingdom]] of [[god]], and of salvation,
it is not hard to interpret, what is meant by the [[world]] to come. there
are three worlds [[world]] mentioned in [[scripture]], the old [[world]], the present
world, and the [[world]] to come. of the first, st. peter speaks, (2 pet.
2.5.) "if [[god]] spared not the old [[world]], but saved noah the eighth
person, a preacher of righteousnesse, bringing the flood upon the world
of the ungodly," &c. so the first [[world]], was from adam to the generall
flood. of the [[present]] [[world]], our saviour speaks (john 18.36.) "my
kingdome is not of this [[world]]." for he came onely to [[teach]] [[men]] the way
of salvation, and to renew the kingdome of his [[father]], by his doctrine.
of the [[world]] to come, st. peter speaks, (2 pet. 3. 13.) "neverthelesse
we according to his promise look for new heavens [[heaven]], and a new [[earth]]." this
is that [[world]], wherein [[christ]] coming down from [[heaven]], in the clouds,
with [[great]] [[power]], and [[glory]], shall send his angels, and shall gather
together his elect, from the four winds, and from the uttermost parts
of the [[earth]], and thence forth reign over them, (under his father)
everlastingly.




redemption

salvation of a sinner, supposeth a precedent redemption; for he that is
once guilty of [[sin]], is obnoxious to the penalty of the same; and must
pay (or some other for him) such ransome, as he that is offended, and
has him in his [[power]], shall require. and seeing the [[person]] offended, is
almighty [[god]], in whose [[power]] are all things; such ransome is to be paid
before salvation can be acquired, as [[god]] hath been pleased to require.
by this ransome, is not intended a satisfaction for [[sin]], equivalent to
the offence, which no sinner for himselfe, nor righteous [[man]] can ever be
able to make for another; the dammage a [[man]] does to another, he may make
amends for by restitution, or recompence, but [[sin]] cannot be taken
away by recompence; for that were to make the [[liberty]] to [[sin]], a thing
vendible. but sins [[sin]] may bee pardoned to the repentant, either gratis, or
upon such penalty, as [[god]] is pleased to accept. that which [[god]] usually
accepted in the old testament, was some [[sacrifice]], or oblation. to
forgive [[sin]] is not an act of [[injustice]], though the [[punishment]] have
been threatned. even amongst [[men]], though the promise of [[good]], bind the
promiser; yet threats, that is to say, promises, of evill, bind them
not; much lesse shall they bind [[god]], who is infinitely more mercifull
then [[men]]. our saviour [[christ]] therefore to redeem us, did not in that
sense satisfie for the sins [[sin]] of [[men]], as that his [[death]], of its own
vertue, could make it [[unjust]] in [[god]] to punish sinners with eternall
death; but did make that [[sacrifice]], and oblation of himself, at his
first coming, which [[god]] was pleased to require, for the salvation at his
second coming, of such as in the mean [[time]] should repent, and beleeve in
him. and though this act of our redemption, be not alwaies in scripture
called a [[sacrifice]], and oblation, but sometimes a price, yet by price
we are not to [[understand]] any thing, by the value whereof, he could claim
right to a pardon for us, from his offended [[father]], but that price which
god the [[father]] was pleased in [[mercy]] to demand.



chapter xxxix. of the signification in [[scripture]] of the word church




church the lords [[lord]] house

the word [[church]], (ecclesia) signifieth in the books [[book]] of holy scripture
divers things. sometimes (though not often) it is taken for gods house,
that is to say, for a temple, wherein christians [[christian]] assemble to perform
holy duties [[duty]] publiquely; as, 1 cor. 14. ver. 34. "let your [[women]] keep
silence in the churches [[church]]:" but this is metaphorically put, for the
congregation there assembled; and hath been since used for the
edifice it [[self]], to distinguish between the temples of christians [[christian]], and
idolaters. the temple of [[jerusalem]] was gods house, and the house of
prayer; and so is any edifice dedicated by christians [[christian]] to the [[worship]] of
christ, christs house: and therefore the [[greek]] fathers [[father]] call it kuriake,
the lords [[lord]] house; and thence, in our [[language]] it came to be called kyrke,
and [[church]].




ecclesia properly what

church (when not taken for a house) signifieth the same that ecclesia
signified in the grecian common-wealths; that is to say, a congregation,
or an assembly of [[citizens]], called forth, to hear the magistrate speak
unto them; and which in the common-wealth of [[rome]] was called concio, as
he that spake was called ecclesiastes, and concionator. and when they
were called forth by lawfull [[authority]], (acts 19.39.) it was ecclesia
legitima, a lawfull [[church]], ennomos ecclesia. but when they were excited
by tumultuous, and seditious clamor, then it was a confused [[church]],
ecclesia sugkechumene.

it is taken also sometimes for the [[men]] that have [[right]] to be of the
congregation, though not actually assembled; that is to say, for the
whole multitude of [[christian]] [[men]], how far soever they be dispersed: as
(act. 8.3.) where it is said, that "saul made havock of the [[church]]:" and
in this sense is [[christ]] said to be head of the [[church]]. and sometimes for
a [[certain]] part of christians [[christian]], as (col. 4.15.) "salute the [[church]] that is
in his house." sometimes also for the elect onely; as (ephes. 5.27.) "a
glorious [[church]], without spot, or wrinkle, holy, and without blemish;"
which is meant of the [[church]] triumphant, or, [[church]] to come. sometimes,
for a congregation assembled, of professors of [[christianity]], whether
their profession be true, or counterfeit, as it is understood, mat.
18.17. where it is said, "tell it to the [[church]], and if hee neglect to
hear the [[church]], let him be to thee as a gentile, or publican."




in what sense the [[church]] is one [[person]] [[church]] defined

and in this [[last]] sense only it is that the [[church]] can be taken for one
person; that is to say, that it can be said to have [[power]] to will, to
pronounce, to command, to be obeyed, to make laws [[law]], or to doe any other
action whatsoever; for without [[authority]] from a lawfull congregation,
whatsoever act be done in a concourse of [[people]], it is the particular
act of every one of those that were [[present]], and gave their aid to the
performance of it; and not the act of them all in grosse, as of one
body; much lesse that act of them that were absent, or that being
present, were not willing it should be done. according to this sense, i
define a [[church]] to be, "a company of [[men]] professing [[christian]] [[religion]],
united in the [[person]] of one soveraign; at whose command they ought to
assemble, and without whose [[authority]] they ought not to assemble." and
because in all common-wealths, that assembly, which is without warrant
from the civil soveraign, is unlawful; that [[church]] also, which is
assembled in any common-wealth, that hath forbidden them to assemble, is
an unlawfull assembly.




a [[christian]] common-wealth, and a [[church]] all one

it followeth also, that there is on [[earth]], no such universall [[church]] as
all christians [[christian]] are bound to obey; because there is no [[power]] on [[earth]], to
which all other common-wealths are [[subject]]: there are christians [[christian]], in
the dominions of severall princes [[prince]] and states; but every one of them
is [[subject]] to that common-wealth, whereof he is himself a member; and
consequently, cannot be [[subject]] to the commands of any other [[person]].
and therefore a [[church]], such as one as is capable to command, to [[judge]],
absolve, condemn, or do any other act, is the same thing with a civil
common-wealth, consisting of [[christian]] [[men]]; and is called a civill
state, for that the subjects [[subject]] of it are [[men]]; and a [[church]], for that the
subjects thereof are christians [[christian]]. temporall and spirituall [[government]],
are but two words brought into the [[world]], to make [[men]] see double, and
mistake their lawfull soveraign. it is true, that the bodies [[body]] of the
faithfull, after the resurrection shall be not onely spirituall, but
eternall; but in this [[life]] they are grosse, and corruptible. there
is therefore no other [[government]] in this [[life]], neither of [[state]], nor
religion, but temporall; nor teaching of any doctrine, lawfull to any
subject, which the governour both of the [[state]], and of the [[religion]],
forbiddeth to be taught: and that governor must be one; or else there
must needs [[follow]] faction, and civil [[war]] in the common-wealth, between
the [[church]] and [[state]]; between spiritualists, and temporalists; between
the [[sword]] of [[justice]], and the shield of [[faith]]; and (which is more) in
every [[christian]] mans [[man]] own brest, between the [[christian]], and the [[man]].
the doctors of the [[church]], are called [[pastors]]; so also are civill
soveraignes: but if [[pastors]] be not subordinate one to another, so
as that there may bee one [[chief]] pastor, [[men]] will be taught contrary
doctrines, whereof both may be, and one must be false. who that one
chief pastor is, according to the [[law]] of [[nature]], hath been already
shewn; namely, that it is the civill soveraign; and to whom the
scripture hath assigned that office, we shall see in the chapters
following.




chapter xl of the rights [[right]] of the kingdome of [[god]], in [[abraham]], [[moses]],
high priests [[priest]], and the kings [[king]] of judah




the soveraign rights [[right]] of abraham

the [[father]] of the faithfull, and first in the kingdome of [[god]] by
covenant, was [[abraham]]. for with him was the covenant first made; wherein
he obliged himself, and his seed after him, to acknowledge and obey the
commands of [[god]]; not onely such, as he could take notice of, (as morall
laws,) by the [[light]] of [[nature]]; but also such, as [[god]] should in speciall
manner deliver to him by dreams [[dream]] and visions. for as to the morall [[law]],
they were already obliged, and needed not have been contracted withall,
by promise of the [[land]] of canaan. nor was there any contract, that could
adde to, or strengthen the obligation, by which both they, and all
men else were bound naturally to obey [[god]] almighty: and therefore the
covenant which [[abraham]] made with [[god]], was to take for the commandement
of [[god]], that which in the name of [[god]] was commanded him, in a [[dream]], or
vision, and to deliver it to his [[family]], and cause them to observe the
same.




abraham had the sole [[power]] of ordering the [[religion]] of his own people

in this contract of [[god]] with [[abraham]], wee may observe three points of
important consequence in the [[government]] of gods [[people]]. first, that at
the making of this covenant, [[god]] spake onely to [[abraham]]; and therefore
contracted not with any of his [[family]], or seed, otherwise then as their
wills (which make the essence of all covenants) were before the contract
involved in the will of [[abraham]]; who was therefore supposed to have had
a lawfull [[power]], to make them perform all that he covenanted for them.
according whereunto (gen 18.18, 19.) [[god]] saith, "all the nations of the
earth shall be blessed in him, for i [[know]] him that he will command his
children and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the
lord." from whence may be concluded this first point, that they to
whom [[god]] hath not spoken immediately, are to receive the positive
commandements of [[god]], from their soveraign; as the [[family]] and seed of
abraham did from [[abraham]] their [[father]], and [[lord]], and civill soveraign.
and consequently in every common-wealth, they who have no supernaturall
revelation to the contrary, ought to obey the laws [[law]] of their own
soveraign, in the externall acts and profession of [[religion]]. as for the
inward [[thought]], and beleef of [[men]], which humane governours can take no
notice of, (for [[god]] onely knoweth the heart) they are not voluntary, nor
the effect of the laws [[law]], but of the unrevealed will, and of the [[power]] of
god; and consequently fall not under obligation.




no pretence of private spirit against the [[religion]] of abraham

from whence proceedeth another point, that it was not unlawfull for
abraham, when any of his subjects [[subject]] should pretend private vision, or
spirit, or other revelation from [[god]], for the countenancing of any
doctrine which [[abraham]] should forbid, or when they followed, or adhered
to any such pretender, to punish them; and consequently that it is
lawfull now for the soveraign to punish any [[man]] that shall oppose his
private spirit against the laws [[law]]: for hee hath the same place in the
common-wealth, that [[abraham]] had in his own [[family]].




abraham sole [[judge]], and interpreter of what [[god]] spake

there ariseth also from the same, a third point; that as none but
abraham in his [[family]], so none but the soveraign in a christian
common-wealth, can take notice what is, or what is not the word of [[god]].
for [[god]] spake onely to [[abraham]]; and it was he onely, that was able
to [[know]] what [[god]] said, and to interpret the same to his [[family]]: and
therefore also, they that have the place of [[abraham]] in a common-wealth,
are the onely interpreters of what [[god]] hath spoken.




the [[authority]] of [[moses]] whereon grounded

the same covenant was renewed with isaac; and afterwards with jacob; but
afterwards no more, till the israelites were freed from the [[egyptians]],
and arrived at the foot of mount sinai: and then it was renewed by moses
(as i have said before, chap. 35.) in such manner, as they became from
that [[time]] forward the peculiar kingdome of [[god]]; whose lieutenant was
moses, for his owne [[time]]; and the succession to that office was setled
upon aaron, and his heirs after him, to bee to [[god]] a sacerdotall
kingdome for ever.

by this [[constitution]], a kingdome is acquired to [[god]]. but seeing moses
had no [[authority]] to govern the israelites, as a successor to the right
of [[abraham]], because he could not claim it by [[inheritance]]; it appeareth
not as yet, that the [[people]] were obliged to take him for gods
lieutenant, longer than they beleeved that [[god]] spake unto him. and
therefore his [[authority]] (notwithstanding the covenant they made with
god) depended yet merely upon the [[opinion]] they had of his [[sanctity]],
and of the reality of his conferences with [[god]], and the verity of his
miracles; which [[opinion]] coming to [[change]], they were no more obliged to
take any thing for the [[law]] of [[god]], which he propounded to them in gods
name. we are therefore to consider, what other ground there was, of
their obligation to obey him. for it could not be the commandement of
god that could oblige them; because [[god]] spake not to them immediately,
but by the mediation of [[moses]] himself; and our saviour saith of himself,
(john 5. 31.) "if i bear witnesse of my [[self]], my witnesse is not true,"
much lesse if [[moses]] bear witnesse of himselfe, (especially in a claim of
kingly [[power]] over gods people) ought his testimony to be received. his
authority therefore, as the [[authority]] of all other princes [[prince]], must be
grounded on the [[consent]] of the [[people]], and their promise to obey him.
and so it was: for "the people" (exod. 20.18.) "when they saw the
thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noyse of the trumpet, and the
mountaine smoaking, removed, and stood a far off. and they said unto
moses, speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not [[god]] speak with
us lest we [[die]]." here was their promise of [[obedience]]; and by this it was
they obliged themselves to obey whatsoever he should deliver unto them
for the commandement of [[god]].




moses was (under god) soveraign of the [[jews]], all his own [[time]], though
aaron had the priesthood

and notwithstanding the covenant constituted a sacerdotall kingdome,
that is to say, a kingdome hereditary to aaron; yet that is to be
understood of the succession, after [[moses]] should bee [[dead]]. for
whosoever ordereth, and establisheth the policy, as first founder of
a common-wealth (be it [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], or democracy) must needs
have soveraign [[power]] over the [[people]] all the while he is doing of it.
and that [[moses]] had that [[power]] all his own [[time]], is evidently affirmed in
the [[scripture]]. first, in the text [[last]] before cited, because the people
promised [[obedience]], not to aaron but to him. secondly, (exod. 24.1, 2.)
"and [[god]] said unto [[moses]], come up unto the [[lord]], thou, and aaron, nadab
and abihu, and seventy of the elders of [[israel]]. and [[moses]] alone shall
come neer the [[lord]], but they shall not come nigh, neither shall the
people goe up with him." by which it is plain, that [[moses]] who was alone
called up to [[god]], (and not aaron, nor the other priests [[priest]], nor the seventy
elders, nor the [[people]] who were forbidden to come up) was alone he, that
represented to the israelites the [[person]] of [[god]]; that is to say, was
their sole soveraign under [[god]]. and though afterwards it be said (verse
9.) "then went up [[moses]], and aaron, nadab, and abihu, and seventy of the
elders of [[israel]], and they saw the [[god]] of [[israel]], and there was under
his feet, as it were a paved [[work]] of a saphire stone," &c. yet this was
not till after [[moses]] had been with [[god]] before, and had brought to
the [[people]] the words which [[god]] had said to him. he onely went for the
businesse of the [[people]]; the others, as the nobles [[noble]] of his retinue, were
admitted for [[honour]] to that speciall grace, which was not allowed to
the [[people]]; which was, (as in the verse after appeareth) to see [[god]] and
live. "god laid not his hand upon them, they saw [[god]] and did [[eat]] and
drink" (that is, did live), but did not carry any commandement from
him to the [[people]]. again, it is every where said, "the [[lord]] spake unto
moses," as in all other occasions [[occasion]] of [[government]]; so also in the ordering
of the ceremonies [[ceremony]] of [[religion]], contained in the 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,
and 31 chapters [[chapter]] of exodus, and throughout leviticus: to aaron seldome.
the calfe that aaron made, [[moses]] threw into the [[fire]]. lastly, the
question of the [[authority]] of aaron, by [[occasion]] of his and miriams
mutiny against [[moses]], was (numbers 12.) judged by [[god]] himself for [[moses]].
so also in the [[question]] between [[moses]], and the [[people]], when corah,
dathan, and abiram, and two hundred and fifty princes [[prince]] of the assembly
"gathered themselves together" (numbers 16. 3) "against [[moses]], and
against aaron, and said unto them, ‘ye take too much upon you, seeing
all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the [[lord]] is
amongst them, why lift you up your selves above the congregation of the
lord?’" [[god]] caused the [[earth]] to swallow corah, dathan, and abiram with
their wives [[wife]] and [[children]] alive, and consumed those two hundred and fifty
princes with [[fire]]. therefore neither aaron, nor the [[people]], nor any
aristocracy of the [[chief]] princes [[prince]] of the [[people]], but [[moses]] alone had next
under [[god]] the soveraignty over the israelites: and that not onely in
causes of civill policy, but also of [[religion]]; for [[moses]] onely spake
with [[god]], and therefore onely could tell the [[people]], what it was that
god required at their hands. no [[man]] upon [[pain]] of [[death]] might be so
presumptuous as to approach the mountain where [[god]] talked with [[moses]].
"thou shalt set bounds" (saith the [[lord]], exod 19. 12.) "to the people
round about, and say, take heed to your selves that you goe not up into
the mount, or touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth the mount shall
surely be put to [[death]]." and again (verse 21.) "get down, charge the
people, lest they break through unto the [[lord]] to gaze." out of which we
may conclude, that whosoever in a [[christian]] common-wealth holdeth the
place of [[moses]], is the sole messenger of [[god]], and interpreter of
his commandements. and according hereunto, no [[man]] ought in the
interpretation of the [[scripture]] to proceed further then the bounds which
are set by their severall soveraigns. for the scriptures [[scripture]] since [[god]] now
speaketh in them, are the mount sinai; the bounds whereof are the laws
of them that represent gods [[person]] on [[earth]]. to look upon them and
therein to behold the wondrous works [[work]] of [[god]], and learn to [[fear]] him is
allowed; but to interpret them; that is, to pry into what [[god]] saith to
him whom he appointeth to govern under him, and make themselves judges
whether he govern as [[god]] commandeth him, or not, is to transgresse the
bounds [[god]] hath set us, and to gaze upon [[god]] irreverently.




all spirits were subordinate to the spirit of moses

there was no [[prophet]] in the [[time]] of [[moses]], nor pretender to the spirit
of [[god]], but such as [[moses]] had approved, and authorized. for there were
in his [[time]] but seventy [[men]], that are said to prophecy by the spirit of
god, and these were of all [[moses]] his election; concerning whom [[god]] saith
to [[moses]] (numb. 11.16.) "gather to mee seventy of the elders of [[israel]],
whom thou knowest to be the elders of the [[people]]." to these [[god]] imparted
his spirit; but it was not a different spirit from that of [[moses]]; for
it is said (verse 25.) "god came down in a cloud, and took of the spirit
that was upon [[moses]], and gave it to the seventy elders." but as i have
shewn before (chap. 36.) by spirit, is understood the [[mind]]; so that the
sense of the place is no other than this, that [[god]] endued them with
a [[mind]] conformable, and subordinate to that of [[moses]], that they might
prophecy, that is to say, speak to the [[people]] in gods name, in such
manner, as to set forward (as ministers of [[moses]], and by his authority)
such doctrine as was agreeable to [[moses]] his doctrine. for they were but
ministers; and when two of them prophecyed in the camp, it was thought
a new and unlawfull thing; and as it is in the 27. and 28. verses of
the same [[chapter]], they were accused of it, and joshua advised [[moses]] to
forbid them, as not knowing that it was by [[moses]] his spirit that they
prophecyed. by which it is manifest, that no [[subject]] ought to pretend to
prophecy, or to the spirit, in opposition to the doctrine established by
him, whom [[god]] hath set in the place of [[moses]].




after [[moses]] the soveraignty was in the high priest

aaron being [[dead]], and after him also [[moses]], the kingdome, as being a
sacerdotall kingdome, descended by vertue of the covenant, to aarons
son, eleazar the high [[priest]]: and [[god]] declared him (next under himself)
for soveraign, at the same [[time]] that he appointed joshua for the
generall of their [[army]]. for thus [[god]] saith expressely (numb. 27.21.)
concerning joshua; "he shall stand before eleazar the [[priest]], who shall
ask counsell for him, before the [[lord]], at his word shall they goe out,
and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the [[children]] of
israel with him:" therefore the supreme [[power]] of making [[war]] and [[peace]],
was in the [[priest]]. the supreme [[power]] of judicature belonged also to
the high [[priest]]: for the [[book]] of the [[law]] was in their keeping; and the
priests and levites onely were the subordinate judges [[judge]] in causes civill,
as appears in deut. 17.8, 9, 10. and for the manner of gods [[worship]],
there was never [[doubt]] made, but that the high [[priest]] till the time
of saul, had the supreme [[authority]]. therefore the civill and
ecclesiasticall [[power]] were both joined together in one and the same
person, the high [[priest]]; and ought to bee so, in whosoever governeth by
divine [[right]]; that is, by [[authority]] immediate from [[god]].




of the soveraign [[power]] between the [[time]] of joshua and of saul

after the [[death]] of joshua, till the [[time]] of saul, the [[time]] between is
noted frequently in the [[book]] of judges [[judge]], "that there was in those dayes
no [[king]] in [[israel]];" and sometimes with this addition, that "every
man did that which was [[right]] in his own [[eyes]]." by which is to bee
understood, that where it is said, "there was no [[king]]," is meant, "there
was no soveraign power" in [[israel]]. and so it was, if we consider the
act, and exercise of such [[power]]. for after the [[death]] of joshua, &
eleazar, "there arose another generation" (judges 2.10.) "that knew not
the [[lord]], nor the works [[work]] which he had done for [[israel]], but did evill in
the sight of the [[lord]], and served baalim." and the [[jews]] had that quality
which st. paul noteth, "to look for a sign," not onely before they would
submit themselves to the [[government]] of [[moses]], but also after they had
obliged themselves by their submission. whereas signs, and [[miracles]] had
for end to procure [[faith]], not to keep [[men]] from violating it, when they
have once given it; for to that [[men]] are obliged by the [[law]] of [[nature]].
but if we consider not the exercise, but the [[right]] of governing, the
soveraign [[power]] was still in the high [[priest]]. therefore whatsoever
obedience was yeelded to any of the judges [[judge]], (who were [[men]] chosen by god
extraordinarily, to save his rebellious subjects [[subject]] out of the hands of
the [[enemy]],) it cannot bee drawn into argument against the [[right]] the high
priest had to the soveraign [[power]], in all matters, both of policy and
religion. and neither the judges [[judge]], nor samuel himselfe had an ordinary,
but extraordinary calling to the [[government]]; and were obeyed by the
israelites, not out of [[duty]], but out of reverence to their favour
with [[god]], appearing in their wisdome, [[courage]], or felicity. hitherto
therefore the [[right]] of regulating both the policy, and the [[religion]],
were inseparable.




of the rights [[right]] of the kings [[king]] of israel

to the judges [[judge]], succeeded kings [[king]]; and whereas before, all [[authority]], both
in [[religion]], and policy, was in the high [[priest]]; so now it was all in
the [[king]]. for the soveraignty over the [[people]], which was before, not
onely by vertue of the [[divine]] [[power]], but also by a particular pact of
the israelites in [[god]], and next under him, in the high [[priest]], as his
viceregent on [[earth]], was cast off by the [[people]], with the [[consent]] of god
himselfe. for when they said to samuel (1 sam. 8.5.) "make us a [[king]] to
judge us, like all the nations," they signified that they would no
more bee governed by the commands that should bee laid upon them by the
priest, in the name of [[god]]; but by one that should command them in the
same manner that all other nations were commanded; and consequently in
deposing the high [[priest]] of royall [[authority]], they deposed that peculiar
government of [[god]]. and yet [[god]] consented to it, saying to samuel (verse
7.) "hearken unto the voice of the [[people]], in all that they shall say
unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected mee,
that i should not reign over them." having therefore rejected [[god]], in
whose [[right]] the priests [[priest]] governed, there was no [[authority]] left to the
priests, but such as the [[king]] was pleased to allow them; which was
more, or lesse, according as the kings [[king]] were [[good]], or evill. and for the
government of civill affaires, it is manifest, it was all in the hands
of the [[king]]. for in the same [[chapter]], verse 20. they say they will be
like all the nations; that their [[king]] shall be their [[judge]], and goe
before them, and [[fight]] their battells; that is, he shall have the
whole [[authority]], both in [[peace]] and [[war]]. in which is contained also the
ordering of [[religion]]; for there was no other word of [[god]] in that [[time]],
by which to regulate [[religion]], but the [[law]] of [[moses]], which was their
civill [[law]]. besides, we [[read]] (1 kings [[king]] 2.27.) that solomon "thrust out
abiathar from being [[priest]] before the [[lord]]:" he had therefore authority
over the high [[priest]], as over any other [[subject]]; which is a great
mark of [[supremacy]] in [[religion]]. and we [[read]] also (1 kings [[king]] 8.) that hee
dedicated the temple; that he blessed the [[people]]; and that he himselfe
in [[person]] made that excellent prayer, used in the consecrations of all
churches, and houses of prayer; which is another [[great]] mark of supremacy
in [[religion]]. again, we [[read]] (2 kings [[king]] 22.) that when there was question
concerning the [[book]] of the [[law]] found in the temple, the same was not
decided by the high [[priest]], but josiah sent both him, and others to
enquire concerning it, of hulda, the prophetesse; which is another mark
of the [[supremacy]] in [[religion]]. lastly, wee [[read]] (1 chro. 26.30.) that
david made hashabiah and his brethren [[brother]], hebronites, officers of israel
among them westward, "in all businesse of the [[lord]], and in the service
of the [[king]]." likewise (verse 32.) that hee made other hebronites,
"rulers over the reubenites, the gadites, and the halfe tribe of
manasseh" (these were the rest of [[israel]] that dwelt beyond jordan) "for
every matter pertaining to [[god]], and affairs of the [[king]]." is not this
full [[power]], both temporall and spirituall, as they call it, that would
divide it? to conclude; from the first institution of gods kingdome, to
the captivity, the [[supremacy]] of [[religion]], was in the same hand with that
of the civill soveraignty; and the priests [[priest]] office after the election of
saul, was not magisteriall, but ministeriall.




the practice of [[supremacy]] in [[religion]], was not in the [[time]] of the kings [[king]],
according to the [[right]] thereof

notwithstanding the [[government]] both in policy and [[religion]], were joined,
first in the high priests [[priest]], and afterwards in the kings [[king]], so far forth as
concerned the [[right]]; yet it appeareth by the same holy [[history]], that the
people understood it not; but there being amongst them a [[great]] part, and
probably the [[greatest]] part, that no longer than they saw [[great]] [[miracles]],
or (which is equivalent to a miracle) [[great]] abilities, or [[great]] felicity
in the enterprises of their governours, gave sufficient credit, either
to the fame of [[moses]], or to the colloquies between [[god]] and the priests [[priest]];
they took [[occasion]] as oft as their governours displeased them, by
blaming sometimes the policy, sometimes the [[religion]], to [[change]] the
government, or revolt from their [[obedience]] at their [[pleasure]]: and from
thence proceeded from [[time]] to [[time]] the civill troubles, divisions, and
calamities of the nation. as for [[example]], after the [[death]] of eleazar and
joshua, the next [[generation]] which had not seen the wonders of [[god]], but
were left to their own [[weak]] [[reason]], not knowing themselves obliged
by the covenant of a sacerdotall kingdome, regarded no more the
commandement of the [[priest]], nor any [[law]] of [[moses]], but did every [[man]] that
which was [[right]] in his own [[eyes]]; and obeyed in civill affairs, such
men, as from [[time]] to [[time]] they [[thought]] able to deliver them from the
neighbour nations that [[oppressed]] them; and consulted not with [[god]] (as
they ought to doe,) but with such [[men]], or [[women]], as they guessed to bee
prophets by their praedictions of things to come; and [[thought]] they had
an idol in their chappel, yet if they had a levite for their chaplain,
they made account they worshipped the [[god]] of [[israel]].

and afterwards when they demanded a [[king]], after the manner of the
nations; yet it was not with a design to depart from the [[worship]] of god
their [[king]]; but despairing of the [[justice]] of the sons [[son]] of samuel, they
would have a [[king]] to judg them in civill actions; but not that they
would allow their [[king]] to [[change]] the [[religion]] which they [[thought]] was
recommended to them by [[moses]]. so that they alwaies kept in store a
pretext, either of [[justice]], or [[religion]], to discharge themselves of
their [[obedience]], whensoever they had [[hope]] to prevaile. samuel was
displeased with the [[people]], for that they [[desired]] a [[king]], (for [[god]] was
their [[king]] already, and samuel had but an [[authority]] under him); yet did
samuel, when saul observed not his counsell, in destroying agag as god
had commanded, anoint another [[king]], namely [[david]], to take the succession
from his heirs. rehoboam was no idolater; but when the [[people]] thought
him an oppressor; that civil pretence carried from him ten tribes to
jeroboam an idolater. and generally through the whole [[history]] of the
kings, as well of judah, as of [[israel]], there were prophets [[prophet]] that alwaies
controlled the kings [[king]], for transgressing the [[religion]]; and sometimes also
for errours of [[state]]; (2 chro. 19. 2.) as jehosaphat was reproved by
the [[prophet]] jehu, for aiding the [[king]] of [[israel]] against the syrians;
and hezekiah, by isaiah, for shewing his treasures to the ambassadors of
babylon. by all which it appeareth, that though the [[power]] both of state
and [[religion]] were in the kings [[king]]; yet none of them were uncontrolled
in the use of it, but such as were gracious for their own naturall
abilities, or felicities. so that from the practise of those times [[time]],
there can no argument be drawn, that the [[right]] of [[supremacy]] in religion
was not in the kings [[king]], unlesse we place it in the prophets [[prophet]]; and conclude,
that because hezekiah praying to the [[lord]] before the cherubins, was not
answered from thence, nor then, but afterwards by the [[prophet]] isaiah,
therefore isaiah was supreme head of the [[church]]; or because josiah
consulted hulda the prophetesse, concerning the [[book]] of the [[law]], that
therefore neither he, nor the high [[priest]], but hulda the prophetesse had
the supreme [[authority]] in matter of [[religion]]; which i thinke is not the
opinion of any doctor.




after the captivity the [[jews]] had no setled common-wealth

during the captivity, the [[jews]] had no common-wealth at all: and after
their return, though they renewed their covenant with [[god]], yet there
was no promise made of [[obedience]], neither to esdras, nor to any other;
and presently after they became subjects [[subject]] to the greeks [[greek]] (from whose
customes, and daemonology, and from the doctrine of the cabalists,
their [[religion]] became much corrupted): in such sort as nothing can be
gathered from their confusion, both in [[state]] and [[religion]], concerning
the [[supremacy]] in either. and therefore so far forth as concerneth the
old testament, we may conclude, that whosoever had the soveraignty of
the common-wealth amongst the [[jews]], the same had also the supreme
authority in matter of gods externall [[worship]]; and represented gods
person; that is the [[person]] of [[god]] the [[father]]; though he were not called
by the name of [[father]], till such [[time]] as he sent into the [[world]] his son
jesus [[christ]], to redeem [[mankind]] from their sins [[sin]], and bring them into
his everlasting kingdome, to be saved for evermore. of which we are to
speak in the [[chapter]] following.



chapter xli. of the office of our blessed saviour




three parts of the office of christ

we find in holy [[scripture]] three parts of the office of the messiah: the
first of a redeemer, or saviour: the second of a pastor, counsellour,
or teacher, that is, of a [[prophet]] sent from [[god]], to convert such as god
hath elected to salvation; the third of a [[king]], and eternall [[king]], but
under his [[father]], as [[moses]] and the high priests [[priest]] were in their severall
times. and to these three parts are corespondent three times [[time]]. for our
redemption he wrought at his first coming, by the [[sacrifice]], wherein
he offered up himself for our sinnes upon the crosse: our conversion
he wrought partly then in his own [[person]]; and partly worketh now by his
ministers; and will continue to [[work]] till his coming again. and after
his coming again, shall begin that his glorious reign over his elect,
which is to [[last]] eternally.




his office as a redeemer

to the office of a redeemer, that is, of one that payeth the ransome of
sin, (which ransome is [[death]],) it appertaineth, that he was sacrificed,
and thereby bare upon his own head, and carryed away from us our
iniquities, in such sort as [[god]] had required. not that the [[death]] of one
man, though without sinne, can satisfie for the offences of all [[men]],
in the rigour of [[justice]], but in the [[mercy]] of [[god]], that ordained such
sacrifices for [[sin]], as he was pleased in his [[mercy]] to accept. in the old
law (as we may [[read]], leviticus the 16.) the [[lord]] required, that there
should every year once, bee made an atonement for the sins [[sin]] of all
israel, both priests [[priest]], and others; for the doing whereof, aaron alone was
to [[sacrifice]] for himself and the priests [[priest]] a [[young]] bullock; and for the
rest of the [[people]], he was to receive from them two [[young]] goates, of
which he was to [[sacrifice]] one; but as for the other, which was the scape
goat, he was to lay his hands on the head thereof, and by a confession
of the iniquities of the [[people]], to lay them all on that head, and then
by some opportune [[man]], to cause the goat to be [[led]] into the wildernesse,
and there to escape, and carry away with him the iniquities of the
people. as the [[sacrifice]] of the one goat was a sufficient (because an
acceptable) price for the ransome of all [[israel]]; so the [[death]] of the
messiah, is a sufficient price, for the sins [[sin]] of all [[mankind]], because
there was no more required. our saviour christs sufferings seem to be
here figured, as cleerly, as in the oblation of isaac, or in any other
type of him in the old testament: he was both the sacrificed goat, and
the scape goat; "hee was [[oppressed]], and he was afflicted (isa. 53.7.);
he opened not his mouth; he brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
sheep is dumbe before the shearer, so opened he not his mouth:" here he
is the sacrificed goat. "he hath born our griefs, (ver.4.) and carried
our sorrows [[sorrow]];" and again, (ver. 6.) "the [[lord]] hath laid upon him the
iniquities of us all:" and so he is the scape goat. "he was cut off from
the [[land]] of the living (ver. 8.) for the transgression of my [[people]]:"
there again he is the sacrificed goat. and again (ver. 11.) "he shall
bear their sins [[sin]]:" hee is the scape goat. thus is the lamb of god
equivalent to both those goates; sacrificed, in that he dyed; and
escaping, in his resurrection; being raised opportunely by his [[father]],
and removed from the habitation of [[men]] in his ascension.




christs kingdome not of this world

for as much therefore, as he that redeemeth, hath no title to the thing
redeemed, before the redemption, and ransome paid; and this ransome was
the [[death]] of the redeemer; it is manifest, that our saviour (as man) was
not [[king]] of those that he redeemed, before hee [[suffered]] [[death]]; that is,
during that [[time]] hee conversed bodily on the [[earth]]. i say, he was not
then [[king]] in [[present]], by vertue of the pact, which the faithfull make
with him in baptisme; neverthelesse, by the renewing of their pact with
god in baptisme, they were obliged to obey him for [[king]], (under his
father) whensoever he should be pleased to take the kingdome upon him.
according whereunto, our saviour himself expressely saith, (john 18.36.)
"my kingdome is not of this [[world]]." now seeing the [[scripture]] maketh
mention but of two worlds [[world]]; this that is now, and shall remain to the day
of [[judgment]], (which is therefore also called, the [[last]] day;) and that
which shall bee a new [[heaven]], and a new [[earth]]; the kingdome of christ
is not to begin till the general resurrection. and that is it which our
saviour saith, (mat. 16.27.) "the [[son]] of [[man]] shall come in the glory
of his [[father]], with his angels; and then he shall [[reward]] every man
according to his works [[work]]." to [[reward]] every [[man]] according to his works [[work]], is
to execute the office of a [[king]]; and this is not to be till he come in
the [[glory]] of his [[father]], with his angells. when our saviour saith,
(mat. 23.2.) "the scribes and pharisees sit in [[moses]] seat; all therefore
whatsoever they bid you doe, that observe and doe;" hee declareth
plainly, that hee ascribeth kingly [[power]], for that [[time]], not to
himselfe, but to them. and so hee hath also, where he saith, (luke
12.14.) "who made mee a [[judge]], or divider over you?" and (john 12.47.)
"i came not to [[judge]] the [[world]], but to save the [[world]]." and yet our
saviour came into this [[world]] that hee might bee a [[king]], and a [[judge]] in
the [[world]] to come: for hee was the messiah, that is, the [[christ]], that
is, the anointed [[priest]], and the soveraign [[prophet]] of [[god]]; that is to
say, he was to have all the [[power]] that was in [[moses]] the [[prophet]], in the
high priests [[priest]] that succeeded [[moses]], and in the kings [[king]] that succeeded the
priests. and st. john saies expressely (chap. 5. ver. 22.) "the father
judgeth no [[man]], but hath committed all [[judgment]] to the [[son]]." and this is
not repugnant to that other place, "i came not to [[judge]] the [[world]]:" for
this is spoken of the [[world]] [[present]], the other of the [[world]] to come; as
also where it is said, that at the second coming of [[christ]], (mat. 19.
28.) "yee that have followed me in the regeneration, when the [[son]] of
man shall sit in the [[throne]] of his [[glory]], yee shall also sit on twelve
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of [[israel]]."




the end of christs comming was to renew the covenant of the kingdome
of [[god]], and to perswade the elect to imbrace it, which was the second
part of his office

if then [[christ]] while hee was on [[earth]], had no kingdome in this [[world]],
to what end was his first coming? it was to restore unto [[god]], by a new
covenant, the kingdome, which being his by the old covenant, had been
cut off by the rebellion of the israelites in the election of saul.
which to doe, he was to preach unto them, that he was the messiah, that
is, the [[king]] promised to them by the prophets [[prophet]]; and to offer himselfe in
sacrifice for the sinnes of them that should by [[faith]] submit themselves
thereto; and in case the nation generally should refuse him, to call
to his [[obedience]] such as should beleeve in him amongst the gentiles. so
that there are two parts of our saviours office during his aboad upon
the [[earth]]; one to proclaim himself the [[christ]]; and another by teaching,
and by working of [[miracles]], to perswade, and prepare [[men]] to [[live]] so, as
to be worthy of the immortality beleevers were to enjoy, at such [[time]] as
he should come in majesty, to take possession of his fathers [[father]] kingdome.
and therefore it is, that the [[time]] of his preaching, is often by himself
called the regeneration; which is not properly a kingdome, and thereby
a warrant to deny [[obedience]] to the magistrates that then were, (for
hee commanded to obey those that sate then in [[moses]] chaire, and to pay
tribute to caesar;) but onely an earnest of the kingdome of [[god]] that was
to come, to those to whom [[god]] had given the grace to be his disciples,
and to beleeve in him; for which cause the godly are said to bee already
in the kingdome of grace, as naturalized in that heavenly kingdome.




the preaching of [[christ]] not contrary to the then [[law]] of the [[jews]], nor
of caesar

hitherto therefore there is nothing done, or taught by [[christ]], that
tendeth to the diminution of the civill [[right]] of the jewes, or of
caesar. for as touching the common-wealth which then was amongst
the [[jews]], both they that bare [[rule]] amongst them, that they that were
governed, did all expect the messiah, and kingdome of [[god]]; which they
could not have done if their laws [[law]] had forbidden him (when he came) to
manifest, and declare himself. seeing therefore he did nothing, but by
preaching, and [[miracles]] go about to prove himselfe to be that messiah,
hee did therein nothing against their laws [[law]]. the kingdome hee claimed was
to bee in another [[world]]; he taught all [[men]] to obey in the mean [[time]] them
that sate in [[moses]] seat: he allowed them to give caesar his tribute, and
refused to take upon himselfe to be a judg. how then could his words,
or actions bee seditious, or tend to the overthrow of their then civill
government? but [[god]] having determined his [[sacrifice]], for the reduction
of his elect to their former covenanted [[obedience]], for the means,
whereby he would bring the same to effect, made use of their malice,
and ingratitude. nor was it contrary to the laws [[law]] of caesar. for though
pilate himself (to gratifie the jews) delivered him to be crucified; yet
before he did so, he pronounced openly, that he found no [[fault]] in him:
and put for title of his condemnation, not as the [[jews]] required, "that
he pretended to be [[king]];" but simply, "that hee was [[king]] of the [[jews]];"
and notwithstanding their clamour, refused to alter it; saying, "what i
have written, i have written."




the third part of his office was to be [[king]] (under his father) of the
elect

as for the third part of his office, which was to be [[king]], i have
already shewn that his kingdome was not to begin till the resurrection.
but then he shall be [[king]], not onely as [[god]], in which sense he is
king already, and ever shall be, of all the [[earth]], in vertue of his
omnipotence; but also peculiarly of his own elect, by vertue of the
pact they make with him in their baptisme. and therefore it is, that
our saviour saith (mat. 19.28.) that his [[apostles]] should sit upon twelve
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of [[israel]], "when the [[son]] of [[man]] shall
sit in the [[throne]] of his [[glory]];" whereby he signified that he should
reign then in his humane [[nature]]; and (mat. 16.27.) "the [[son]] of [[man]] shall
come in the [[glory]] of his [[father]], with his angels, and then he shall
reward every [[man]] according to his works [[work]]." the same we may [[read]], marke
13..26. and 14.26. and more expressely for the [[time]], luke 22.29, 30. "i
appoint unto you a kingdome, as my [[father]] hath appointed to mee, that
you may [[eat]] and drink at my table in my kingdome, and sit on thrones
judging the twelve tribes of [[israel]]." by which it is manifest that the
kingdome of [[christ]] appointed to him by his [[father]], is not to be before
the [[son]] of [[man]] shall come in [[glory]], and make his [[apostles]] judges [[judge]] of
the twelve tribes of [[israel]]. but a [[man]] may here ask, seeing there is
no [[marriage]] in the kingdome of [[heaven]], whether [[men]] shall then [[eat]], and
drink; what eating therefore is meant in this place? this is expounded
by our saviour (john 6.27.) where he saith, "labour not for the meat
which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting
life, which the [[son]] of [[man]] shall give you." so that by eating at christs
table, is meant the eating of the tree of [[life]]; that is to say, the
enjoying of immortality, in the kingdome of the [[son]] of [[man]]. by which
places, and many more, it is evident, that our saviours kingdome is to
bee exercised by him in his humane [[nature]].




christs [[authority]] in the kingdome of [[god]] subordinate to his father

again, he is to be [[king]] then, no otherwise than as subordinate, or
viceregent of [[god]] the [[father]], as [[moses]] was in the wildernesse; and as
the high priests [[priest]] were before the reign of saul; and as the kings [[king]] were
after it. for it is one of the prophecies concerning [[christ]], that he
should be like (in office) to [[moses]]; "i will raise them up a prophet
(saith the [[lord]], deut. 18.18.) from amongst their brethren [[brother]] like unto
thee, and will put my words into his mouth," and this similitude with
moses, is also apparent in the actions of our saviour himself, whilest
he was conversant on [[earth]]. for as [[moses]] chose twelve princes [[prince]] of the
tribes, to govern under him; so did our saviour choose twelve [[apostles]],
who shall sit on twelve thrones, and [[judge]] the twelve tribes of [[israel]];
and as [[moses]] authorized seventy elders, to receive the spirit of [[god]],
and to prophecy to the [[people]], that is, (as i have said before,) to
speak unto them in the name of [[god]]; so our saviour also ordained seventy
disciples, to preach his kingdome, and salvation to all nations. and as
when a complaint was made to [[moses]], against those of the seventy that
prophecyed in the camp of [[israel]], he justified them in it, as being
subservient therein to his [[government]]; so also our saviour, when st.
john complained to him of a [[certain]] [[man]] that cast out devills in his
name, justified him therein, saying, (luke 9.50.) "forbid him not, for
hee that is not against us, is on our part."

again, our saviour resembled [[moses]] in the institution of sacraments,
both of admission into the kingdome of [[god]], and of commemoration of his
deliverance of his elect from their miserable condition. as the children
of [[israel]] had for sacrament of their reception into the kingdome of [[god]],
before the [[time]] of [[moses]], the rite of circumcision, which rite having
been omitted in the wildernesse, was again restored as soon as they came
into the [[land]] of promise; so also the [[jews]], before the coming of our
saviour, had a rite of baptizing, that is, of washing with water all
those that being gentiles, embraced the [[god]] of [[israel]]. this rite st.
john the baptist used in the reception of all them that gave their names
to the [[christ]], whom hee preached to bee already come into the [[world]]; and
our saviour instituted the same for a sacrament to be taken by all that
beleeved in him. from what cause the rite of baptisme first proceeded,
is not expressed formally in the [[scripture]]; but it may be probably
thought to be an imitation of the [[law]] of [[moses]], concerning leprousie;
wherein the leprous [[man]] was commanded to be kept out of the campe of
israel for a [[certain]] [[time]]; after which [[time]] being judged by the priest
to be clean, hee was admitted into the campe after a solemne washing.
and this may therefore bee a type of the washing in baptisme; wherein
such [[men]] as are cleansed of the leprousie of [[sin]] by [[faith]], are received
into the [[church]] with the solemnity of baptisme. there is another
conjecture drawn from the ceremonies [[ceremony]] of the gentiles, in a [[certain]] case
that rarely happens; and that is, when a [[man]] that was [[thought]] [[dead]],
chanced to recover, other [[men]] made scruple to converse with him, as they
would doe to converse with a ghost, unlesse hee were received again into
the number of [[men]], by washing, as [[children]] new born were washed from
the uncleannesse of their nativity, which was a [[kind]] of new birth. this
ceremony of the greeks [[greek]], in the [[time]] that judaea was under the dominion
of alexander, and the greeks [[greek]] his successors, may probably enough have
crept into the [[religion]] of the [[jews]]. but seeing it is not likely our
saviour would countenance a heathen rite, it is most likely it proceeded
from the legall [[ceremony]] of washing after leprosie. and for the other
sacraments, of eating the paschall lambe, it is manifestly imitated in
the sacrament of the lords [[lord]] supper; in which the breaking of the bread,
and the pouring out of the wine, do keep in memory our deliverance from
the misery of [[sin]], by christs passion, as the eating of the paschall
lambe, kept in memory the deliverance of the jewes out of the bondage of
egypt. seeing therefore the [[authority]] of [[moses]] was but subordinate, and
hee but a lieutenant to [[god]]; it followeth, that [[christ]], whose [[authority]],
as [[man]], was to bee like that of [[moses]], was no more but subordinate to
the [[authority]] of his [[father]]. the same is more expressely signified, by
that that hee teacheth us to [[pray]], "our [[father]], let thy kingdome come;"
and, "for thine is the kingdome, the [[power]] and the [[glory]];" and by that
it is said, that "hee shall come in the [[glory]] of his [[father]];" and by
that which st. paul saith, (1 cor. 15.24.) "then commeth the end, when
hee shall have delivered up the kingdome to [[god]], even the [[father]];" and
by many other most expresse places.




one and the same [[god]] is the [[person]] represented by [[moses]], and by christ

our saviour therefore, both in teaching, and reigning, representeth (as
moses did) the [[person]] of [[god]]; which [[god]] from that [[time]] forward, but
not before, is called the [[father]]; and being still one and the same
substance, is one [[person]] as represented by [[moses]], and another [[person]] as
represented by his sonne the [[christ]]. for [[person]] being a relative to a
representer, it is consequent to plurality of representers, that there
bee a plurality of persons [[person]], though of one and the same substance.



chapter xlii. of [[power]] ecclesiasticall


for the understanding of [[power]] ecclesiasticall, what, and in whom it is,
we are to distinguish the [[time]] from the ascension of our saviour, into
two parts; one before the conversion of kings [[king]], and [[men]] endued with
soveraign civill [[power]]; the other after their conversion. for it was
long after the ascension, before any [[king]], or civill soveraign embraced,
and publiquely allowed the teaching of [[christian]] [[religion]].




of the holy spirit that fel on the apostles

and for the [[time]] between, it is manifest, that the power
ecclesiasticall, was in the [[apostles]]; and after them in such as were by
them ordained to preach the gospell, and to convert [[men]] to [[christianity]],
and to direct them that were converted in the way of salvation; and
after these the [[power]] was delivered again to others by these ordained,
and this was done by imposition of hands upon such as were ordained; by
which was signified the giving of the holy spirit, or spirit of [[god]], to
those whom they ordained ministers of [[god]], to advance his kingdome.
so that imposition of hands, was nothing else but the seal of their
commission to preach [[christ]], and [[teach]] his doctrine; and the giving of
the holy ghost by that [[ceremony]] of imposition of hands, was an imitation
of that which [[moses]] did. for [[moses]] used the same [[ceremony]] to his
minister joshua, as wee [[read]] deuteronomy 34. ver. 9. "and joshua the son
of nun was full of the spirit of wisdome; for [[moses]] had laid his
hands upon him." our saviour therefore between his resurrection, and
ascension, gave his spirit to the [[apostles]]; first, by "breathing on
them, and saying," (john 20.22.) "receive yee the holy spirit;" and after
his ascension (acts 2.2, 3.) by sending down upon them, a "mighty wind,
and cloven tongues of [[fire]];" and not by imposition of hands; as neither
did [[god]] lay his hands on [[moses]]; and his [[apostles]] afterward, transmitted
the same spirit by imposition of hands, as [[moses]] did to joshua. so that
it is manifest hereby, in whom the [[power]] ecclesiasticall continually
remained, in those first times [[time]], where there was not any christian
common-wealth; namely, in them that received the same from the [[apostles]],
by successive laying on of hands.




of the trinity

here wee have the [[person]] of [[god]] born now the third [[time]]. for as [[moses]],
and the high priests [[priest]], were gods representative in the old testament;
and our saviour himselfe as [[man]], during his abode on [[earth]]: so the holy
ghost, that is to say, the [[apostles]], and their successors, in the office
of preaching, and teaching, that had received the holy spirit, have
represented him ever since. but a [[person]], (as i have shewn before,
[chapt. 16.].) is he that is represented, as often as hee is
represented; and therefore [[god]], who has been represented (that is,
personated) thrice, may properly enough be said to be three persons [[person]];
though neither the word [[person]], nor trinity be ascribed to him in the
bible. st. john indeed (1 epist. 5.7.) saith, "there be three that bear
witnesse in [[heaven]], the [[father]], the word, and the holy spirit; and these
three are one:" but this disagreeth not, but accordeth fitly with three
persons in the proper signification of persons [[person]]; which is, that which is
represented by another. for so [[god]] the [[father]], as represented by [[moses]],
is one [[person]]; and as represented by his sonne, another [[person]], and as
represented by the [[apostles]], and by the doctors that taught by authority
from them derived, is a third [[person]]; and yet every [[person]] here, is
the [[person]] of one and the same [[god]]. but a [[man]] may here ask, what it was
whereof these three bare witnesse. st. john therefore tells us (verse
11.) that they bear witnesse, that "god hath given us eternall life
in his [[son]]." again, if it should be [[asked]], wherein that testimony
appeareth, the [[answer]] is easie; for he hath testified the same by the
miracles he wrought, first by [[moses]]; secondly, by his [[son]] himself; and
lastly by his [[apostles]], that had received the holy spirit; all which
in their times [[time]] represented the [[person]] of [[god]]; and either prophecyed, or
preached [[jesus]] [[christ]]. and as for the [[apostles]], it was the character
of the apostleship, in the twelve first and [[great]] [[apostles]], to bear
witnesse of his resurrection; as appeareth expressely (acts 1. ver.
21,22.) where st peter, when a new apostle was to be chosen in the place
of judas iscariot, useth these words, "of these [[men]] which have companied
with us all the [[time]] that the [[lord]] [[jesus]] went in and out amongst us,
beginning at the baptisme of john, unto that same day that hee was
taken up from us, must one bee ordained to be a witnesse with us of his
resurrection:" which words interpret the bearing of witnesse, mentioned
by st. john. there is in the same place mentioned another trinity of
witnesses in [[earth]]. for (ver. 8.) he saith, "there are three that bear
witnesse in [[earth]], the spirit, and the water, and the bloud; and these
three agree in one:" that is to say, the graces of gods spirit, and the
two sacraments, baptisme, and the lords [[lord]] supper, which all agree in one
testimony, to assure the consciences of beleevers, of eternall [[life]]; of
which testimony he saith (verse 10.) "he that beleeveth on the [[son]] of
man hath the witnesse in himselfe." in this trinity on [[earth]] the unity
is not of the thing; for the spirit, the water, and the bloud, are not
the same substance, though they give the same testimony: but in the
trinity of [[heaven]], the persons [[person]] are the persons [[person]] of one and the same [[god]],
though represented in three different times [[time]] and occasions [[occasion]]. to conclude,
the doctrine of the trinity, as far as can be gathered directly from
the [[scripture]], is in substance this; that [[god]] who is alwaies one and the
same, was the [[person]] represented by [[moses]]; the [[person]] represented by
his [[son]] incarnate; and the [[person]] represented by the [[apostles]]. as
represented by the [[apostles]], the holy spirit by which they spake, is
god; as represented by his [[son]] (that was [[god]] and man), the [[son]] is that
god; as represented by [[moses]], and the high priests [[priest]], the [[father]], that is
to say, the [[father]] of our [[lord]] [[jesus]] [[christ]], is that [[god]]: from whence
we may gather the [[reason]] why those names [[father]], [[son]], and holy spirit in
the signification of the godhead, are never used in the old testament:
for they are persons [[person]], that is, they have their names from representing;
which could not be, till divers [[men]] had represented gods [[person]] in
ruling, or in directing under him.

thus wee see how the [[power]] ecclesiasticall was left by our saviour
to the [[apostles]]; and how they were (to the end they might the better
exercise that [[power]],) endued with the holy spirit, which is therefore
called sometime in the new testament paracletus which signifieth an
assister, or one called to for helpe, though it bee commonly translated
a comforter. let us now consider the [[power]] it selfe, what it was, and
over whom.




the [[power]] ecclesiasticall is but the [[power]] to teach

cardinall bellarmine in his third generall controversie, hath handled a
great many questions [[question]] concerning the ecclesiasticall [[power]] of the pope
of [[rome]]; and begins with this, whether it ought to be monarchicall,
aristocraticall, or democraticall. all which sorts of [[power]], are
soveraign, and coercive. if now it should appear, that there is no
coercive [[power]] left them by our saviour; but onely a [[power]] to proclaim
the [[kingdom]] of [[christ]], and to perswade [[men]] to submit themselves
thereunto; and by precepts and [[good]] counsell, to [[teach]] them that have
submitted, what they are to do, that they may be received into the
kingdom of [[god]] when it comes; and that the [[apostles]], and other ministers
of the gospel, are our schoolemasters, and not our commanders, and their
precepts not laws [[law]], but wholesome counsells then were all that dispute in
vain.




an argument thereof, the [[power]] of [[christ]] himself

i have shewn already (in the [[last]] [[chapter]],) that the kingdome of christ
is not of this [[world]]: therefore neither can his ministers (unlesse they
be kings [[king]],) require [[obedience]] in his name. for if the supreme [[king]], have
not his regall [[power]] in this [[world]]; by what [[authority]] can [[obedience]] be
required to his officers? as my [[father]] sent me, (so saith our saviour)
i send you. but our saviour was sent to perswade the [[jews]] to return to,
and to invite the gentiles, to receive the kingdome of his [[father]], and
not to reign in majesty, no not, as his fathers [[father]] lieutenant, till the day
of [[judgment]].




from the name of regeneration

the [[time]] between the ascension, and the generall resurrection, is
called, not a reigning, but a regeneration; that is, a preparation
of [[men]] for the second and glorious coming of [[christ]], at the day of
judgment; as appeareth by the words of our saviour, mat. 19.28. "you
that have followed me in the regeneration, when the [[son]] of [[man]] shall sit
in the [[throne]] of his [[glory]], you shall also sit upon twelve thrones;" and
of st. paul (ephes. 6.15.) "having your feet shod with the preparation
of the gospell of [[peace]]."




from the comparison of it, with fishing, leaven, seed

and is compared by our saviour, to fishing; that is, to winning men
to [[obedience]], not by coercion, and punishing; but by perswasion: and
therefore he said not to his [[apostles]], hee would make them so many
nimrods, hunters of [[men]]; but fishers of [[men]]. it is compared also to
leaven; to sowing of seed, and to the multiplication of a grain of
mustard-seed; by all which compulsion is excluded; and consequently
there can in that [[time]] be no actual reigning. the [[work]] of christs
ministers, is evangelization; that is, a proclamation of [[christ]], and
a preparation for his second comming; as the evangelization of john
baptist, was a preparation to his first coming.




from the [[nature]] of [[faith]]:

again, the office of christs ministers in this [[world]], is to make men
beleeve, and have [[faith]] in [[christ]]: but [[faith]] hath no relation to, nor
dependence at all upon compulsion, or commandement; but onely upon
certainty, or probability of arguments drawn from [[reason]], or from
something [[men]] beleeve already. therefore the ministers of [[christ]] in this
world, have no [[power]] by that title, to punish any [[man]] for not beleeving,
or for contradicting what they say; they have i say no [[power]] by that
title of christs ministers, to punish such: but if they have soveraign
civill [[power]], by politick institution, then they may indeed lawfully
punish any contradiction to their laws [[law]] whatsoever: and st. paul, of
himselfe and other then preachers of the gospell saith in expresse
words, (2 cor. 1.24.) "wee have no dominion over your [[faith]], but are
helpers of your joy."




from the [[authority]] [[christ]] hath left to civill princes

another argument, that the ministers of [[christ]] in this [[present]] world
have no [[right]] of commanding, may be drawn from the lawfull authority
which [[christ]] hath left to all princes [[prince]], as well christians [[christian]], as infidels.
st. paul saith (col. 3.20.) "children obey your parents in all things;
for this is well pleasing to the [[lord]]." and ver. 22. "servants obey in
all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as
men-pleasers, but in singlenesse of [[heart]], as fearing the [[lord]];" this is
spoken to them whose masters were infidells; and yet they are bidden
to obey them in all things. and again, concerning [[obedience]] to princes [[prince]].
(rom. 13. the first 6. verses) exhorting to "be [[subject]] to the higher
powers," he saith, "that all [[power]] is ordained of [[god]];" and "that we
ought to be [[subject]] to them, not onely for" [[fear]] of incurring their
"wrath, but also for [[conscience]] sake." and st. peter, (1 epist. chap. 2e
ver. 13, 14, 15.) "submit your selves to every ordinance of [[man]], for the
lords sake, whether it bee to the [[king]], as supreme, or unto governours,
as to them that be sent by him for the [[punishment]] of evill doers, and
for the [[praise]] of them that doe well; for so is the will of [[god]]."
and again st. paul (tit. 3.1.) "put [[men]] in [[mind]] to be [[subject]] to
principalities, and powers [[power]], and to obey magistrates." these princes [[prince]], and
powers, whereof st. peter, and st. paul here speak, were all infidels;
much more therefore we are to obey those christians [[christian]], whom [[god]] hath
ordained to have soveraign [[power]] over us. how then can wee be obliged
to doe any thing contrary to the command of the [[king]], or other soveraign
representant of the common-wealth, whereof we are members, and by whom
we look to be protected? it is therefore manifest, that [[christ]] hath not
left to his ministers in this [[world]], unlesse they be also endued with
civill [[authority]], any [[authority]] to command other [[men]].




what christians [[christian]] may do to avoid persecution

but what (may some object) if a [[king]], or a senate, or other soveraign
person forbid us to beleeve in [[christ]]? to this i [[answer]], that such
forbidding is of no effect, because beleef, and unbeleef never follow
mens commands. [[faith]] is a gift of [[god]], which [[man]] can neither give, nor
take away by promise of rewards [[reward]], or menaces of torture. and if it be
further [[asked]], what if wee bee commanded by our lawfull [[prince]], to say
with our tongue, wee beleeve not; must we obey such command? profession
with the tongue is but an externall thing, and no more then any other
gesture whereby we signifie our [[obedience]]; and wherein a [[christian]],
holding firmely in his [[heart]] the [[faith]] of [[christ]], hath the same liberty
which the [[prophet]] elisha allowed to naaman the syrian. naaman was
converted in his [[heart]] to the [[god]] of [[israel]]; for hee saith (2 kings
5.17.) "thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering, nor
sacrifice unto other gods but unto the [[lord]]. in this thing the lord
pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of rimmon
to [[worship]] there, and he leaneth on my hand, and i bow my selfe in the
house of rimmon; when i bow my selfe in the house of rimmon, the lord
pardon thy servant in this thing." this the [[prophet]] approved, and bid
him "goe in [[peace]]." here naaman beleeved in his [[heart]]; but by bowing
before the idol rimmon, he denyed the true [[god]] in effect, as much as
if he had done it with his lips. but then what shall we [[answer]] to our
saviours saying, "whosoever denyeth me before [[men]], i will deny him
before my [[father]] which is in [[heaven]]?" this we may say, that whatsoever
a [[subject]], as naaman was, is compelled to in [[obedience]] to his soveraign,
and doth it not in order to his own [[mind]], but in order to the laws [[law]] of
his [[country]], that action is not his, but his soveraigns; nor is it he
that in this case denyeth [[christ]] before [[men]], but his governour, and the
law of his countrey. if any [[man]] shall accuse this doctrine, as repugnant
to true, and unfeigned [[christianity]]; i ask him, in case there should be
a [[subject]] in any [[christian]] common-wealth, that should be inwardly in his
heart of the mahometan [[religion]], whether if his soveraign command him to
bee [[present]] at the [[divine]] service of the [[christian]] [[church]], and that on
pain of [[death]], he [[think]] that mamometan obliged in [[conscience]] to suffer
death for that cause, rather than to obey that command of his lawful
prince. if he say, he ought rather to suffer [[death]], then he authorizeth
all private [[men]], to disobey their princes [[prince]], in maintenance of their
religion, true, or false; if he say, he ought to bee [[obedient]], then he
alloweth to himself, that which hee denyeth to another, contrary to the
words of our saviour, "whatsoever you would that [[men]] should doe unto
you, that doe yee unto them;" and contrary to the [[law]] of [[nature]], (which
is the indubitable everlasting [[law]] of god) "do not to another, that
which thou wouldest not he should doe unto thee."




of martyrs

but what then shall we say of all those martyrs we [[read]] of in the
history of the [[church]], that they have needlessely cast away their lives [[life]]?
for [[answer]] hereunto, we are to distinguish the persons [[person]] that have been
for that cause put to [[death]]; whereof some have received a calling to
preach, and professe the kingdome of [[christ]] openly; others have had no
such calling, nor more has been required of them than their owne [[faith]].
the former sort, if they have been put to [[death]], for bearing witnesse to
this point, that [[jesus]] [[christ]] is risen from the [[dead]], were true martyrs;
for a martyr is, (to give the true definition of the word) a witnesse of
the resurrection of [[jesus]] the messiah; which none can be but those
that conversed with him on [[earth]], and saw him after he was risen: for a
witnesse must have seen what he testifieth, or else his testimony is not
good. and that none but such, can properly be called martyrs of [[christ]],
is manifest out of the words of st. peter, act. 1.21, 22. "wherefore of
these [[men]] which have companyed with us all the [[time]] that the [[lord]] jesus
went in and out amongst us, beginning from the baptisme of john unto
that same day hee was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a
martyr (that is a witnesse) with us of his resurrection:" where we
may observe, that he which is to bee a witnesse of the [[truth]] of
the resurrection of [[christ]], that is to say, of the [[truth]] of this
fundamentall article of [[christian]] [[religion]], that [[jesus]] was the [[christ]],
must be some disciple that conversed with him, and saw him before, and
after his resurrection; and consequently must be one of his originall
disciples: whereas they which were not so, can witnesse no more, but
that their antecessors said it, and are therefore but witnesses of
other mens [[men]] testimony; and are but second martyrs, or martyrs of christs
witnesses.

he, that to maintain every doctrine which he himself draweth out of
the [[history]] of our saviours [[life]], and of the acts, or epistles of the
apostles; or which he beleeveth upon the [[authority]] of a private [[man]],
wil oppose the laws [[law]] and [[authority]] of the civill [[state]], is very far from
being a martyr of [[christ]], or a martyr of his martyrs. ’tis one article
onely, which to [[die]] for, meriteth so honorable a name; and that article
is this, that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]]; that is to say, he that hath redeemed
us, and shall come again to give us salvation, and eternall [[life]] in his
glorious kingdome. to [[die]] for every tenet that serveth the [[ambition]],
or [[profit]] of the clergy, is not required; nor is it the [[death]] of the
witnesse, but the testimony it [[self]] that makes the martyr: for the word
signifieth nothing else, but the [[man]] that beareth witnesse, whether he
be put to [[death]] for his testimony, or not.

also he that is not sent to preach this fundamentall article, but taketh
it upon him of his private [[authority]], though he be a witnesse, and
consequently a martyr, either primary of [[christ]], or secondary of his
apostles, disciples, or their successors; yet is he not obliged to
suffer [[death]] for that cause; because being not called thereto, tis
not required at his hands; nor ought hee to [[complain]], if he loseth
the [[reward]] he expecteth from those that never set him on [[work]]. none
therefore can be a martyr, neither of the first, nor second [[degree]], that
have not a warrant to preach [[christ]] come in the flesh; that is to say,
none, but such as are sent to the conversion of infidels. for no man
is a witnesse to him that already beleeveth, and therefore needs no
witnesse; but to them that deny, or [[doubt]], or have not heard it. christ
sent his [[apostles]], and his seventy disciples, with [[authority]] to preach;
he sent not all that beleeved: and he sent them to unbeleevers; "i send
you (saith he) as sheep amongst wolves;" not as sheep to other sheep.




argument from the points of their commission

lastly the points of their commission, as they are expressely set down
in the gospel, contain none of them any [[authority]] over the congregation.




to preach

we have first (mat. 10.) that the twelve [[apostles]] were sent "to the
lost sheep of the house of [[israel]]," and commanded to preach, "that the
kingdome of [[god]] was at hand." now preaching in the originall, is that
act, which a crier, herald, or other officer useth to doe publiquely in
proclaiming of a [[king]]. but a crier hath not [[right]] to command any [[man]].
and (luke 10.2.) the seventy disciples are sent out, "as labourers,
not as lords [[lord]] of the harvest;" and are bidden (verse 9.) to say, "the
kingdome of [[god]] is come nigh unto you;" and by kingdome here is meant,
not the kingdome of grace, but the kingdome of [[glory]]; for they are
bidden to denounce it (ver. 11.) to those cities [[city]] which shall not receive
them, as a threatning, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for
sodome, than for such a [[city]]. and (mat. 20.28.) our saviour telleth his
disciples, that sought priority of place, their office was to minister,
even as the [[son]] of [[man]] came, not to be ministred unto, but to minister.
preachers therefore have not magisteriall, but ministeriall [[power]]: "bee
not called masters, (saith our saviour, mat. 23.10) for one is your
master, even [[christ]]."




and teach

another point of their commission, is, to [[teach]] all nations; as it is in
mat. 28.19. or as in st. mark 16.15 "goe into all the [[world]], and preach
the gospel to every creature." teaching therefore, and preaching is the
same thing. for they that proclaim the comming of a [[king]], must withall
make known by what [[right]] he commeth, if they mean [[men]] shall submit
themselves unto him: as st. paul did to the [[jews]] of thessalonica,
when "three [[sabbath]] days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures [[scripture]],
opening, and alledging that [[christ]] must needs have [[suffered]], and risen
again from the [[dead]], and that this [[jesus]] is [[christ]]." but to [[teach]] out
of the old testament that [[jesus]] was [[christ]], (that is to say, [[king]],)
and risen from the [[dead]], is not to say, that [[men]] are bound after they
beleeve it, to obey those that tell them so, against the laws [[law]], and
commands of their soveraigns; but that they shall doe wisely, to expect
the coming of [[christ]] hereafter, in patience, and [[faith]], with obedience
to their [[present]] magistrates.




to baptize;

another point of their commission, is to baptize, "in the name of
the [[father]], and of the [[son]], and of the holy ghost." what is baptisme?
dipping into water. but what is it to dip a [[man]] into the water in the
name of any thing? the meaning of these words of baptisme is this. he
that is baptized, is dipped or washed, as a sign of becomming a new [[man]],
and a loyall [[subject]] to that [[god]], whose [[person]] was represented in old
time by [[moses]], and the high priests [[priest]], when he reigned over the [[jews]]; and
to [[jesus]] [[christ]], his sonne, [[god]], and [[man]], that hath redeemed us, and
shall in his humane [[nature]] represent his fathers [[father]] [[person]] in his eternall
kingdome after the resurrection; and to acknowledge the doctrine of the
apostles, who assisted by the spirit of the [[father]], and of the [[son]], were
left for guides to bring us into that kingdome, to be the onely, and
assured way thereunto. this, being our promise in baptisme; and the
authority of earthly soveraigns being not to be put down till the day of
judgment; (for that is expressely affirmed by s. paul 1 cor. 15. 22, 23,
24. where he saith, "as in adam all [[die]], so in [[christ]] all shall be
made alive. but every [[man]] in his owne order, [[christ]] the first fruits,
afterward they that are christs, at his comming; then commeth the end,
when he shall have delivered up the kingdome of [[god]], even the [[father]],
when he shall have put down all [[rule]], and all [[authority]] and power")
it is manifest, that we do not in baptisme constitute over us another
authority, by which our externall actions are to be governed in this
life; but promise to take the doctrine of the [[apostles]] for our direction
in the way to [[life]] eternall.




and to [[forgive]], and retain sinnes

the [[power]] of remission, and retention of sinnes, called also the power
of loosing, and binding, and sometimes the keyes of the kingdome of
heaven, is a consequence of the [[authority]] to baptize, or refuse to
baptize. for baptisme is the sacrament of allegeance, of them that are
to be received into the kingdome of [[god]]; that is to say, into eternall
life; that is to say, to remission of [[sin]]: for as eternall [[life]] was lost
by the committing, so it is recovered by the remitting of mens [[men]] sins [[sin]]. the
end of baptisme is remission of sins [[sin]]: and therefore st. peter, when they
that were converted by his sermon on the day of pentecost, [[asked]] what
they were to doe, advised them to "repent, and be baptized in the name
of [[jesus]], for the remission of sins [[sin]]." and therefore seeing to baptize
is to declare the reception of [[men]] into gods kingdome; and to refuse to
baptize is to declare their exclusion; it followeth, that the power
to declare them cast out, or retained in it, was given to the same
apostles, and their substitutes, and successors. and therefore after our
saviour had breathed upon them, saying, (john 20.22.) "receive the holy
ghost," hee addeth in the next verse, "whose soever sins [[sin]] ye remit,
they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins [[sin]] ye retain, they are
retained." by which words, is not granted an [[authority]] to [[forgive]], or
retain sins [[sin]], simply and absolutely, as [[god]] forgiveth or retaineth them,
who knoweth the [[heart]] of [[man]], and [[truth]] of his penitence and conversion;
but conditionally, to the penitent: and this forgivenesse, or
absolution, in case the absolved have but a feigned repentance, is
thereby without other act, or sentence of the absolvent, made void,
and hath no effect at all to salvation, but on the contrary, to the
aggravation of his [[sin]]. therefore the [[apostles]], and their successors,
are to [[follow]] but the outward marks of repentance; which appearing, they
have no [[authority]] to deny absolution; and if they appeare not, they have
no [[authority]] to absolve. the same also is to be observed in baptisme:
for to a converted jew, or gentile, the [[apostles]] had not the [[power]] to
deny baptisme; nor to grant it to the un-penitent. but seeing no [[man]] is
able to discern the [[truth]] of another mans [[man]] repentance, further than by
externall marks, taken from his words, and actions, which are [[subject]] to
hypocrisie; another [[question]] will arise, who it is that is constituted
judge of those marks. and this [[question]] is decided by our saviour
himself; (mat. 18. 15, 16, 17.) "if thy [[brother]] (saith he) shall
trespasse against thee, go and tell him his [[fault]] between thee, and him
alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy [[brother]]. but if he
will not hear thee, then take with thee one, or two more. and if he
shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the [[church]], let him be unto
thee as an heathen [[man]], and a publican." by which it is manifest, that
the [[judgment]] concerning the [[truth]] of repentance, belonged not to any one
man, but to the [[church]], that is, to the assembly of the faithfull, or
to them that have [[authority]] to bee their representant. but besides the
judgment, there is necessary also the pronouncing of sentence: and
this belonged alwaies to the apostle, or some pastor of the [[church]],
as prolocutor; and of this our saviour speaketh in the 18 verse,
"whatsoever ye shall bind on [[earth]], shall be bound in [[heaven]]; and
whatsoever ye shall loose on [[earth]], shall be loosed in [[heaven]]." and
comformable hereunto was the practise of st. paul (1 cor. 5.3, 4, & 5.)
where he saith, "for i verily, as absent in [[body]], but [[present]] in spirit,
have determined already, as though i were [[present]], concerning him that
hath so done this deed; in the name of our [[lord]] [[jesus]] [[christ]] when ye
are gathered together, and my spirit, with the [[power]] of our [[lord]] jesus
christ, to deliver such a one to [[satan]];" that is to say, to cast him
out of the [[church]], as a [[man]] whose sins [[sin]] are not forgiven. paul here
pronounceth the sentence; but the assembly was first to hear the cause,
(for st. paul was absent;) and by consequence to condemn him. but in
the same [[chapter]] (ver. 11, 12.) the [[judgment]] in such a case is more
expressely attributed to the assembly: "but now i have written unto
you, not to keep company, if any [[man]] that is called a [[brother]] be a
fornicator, &c. with such a one no not to [[eat]]. for what have i to do to
judg them that are without? do not ye judg them that are within?"
the sentence therefore by which a [[man]] was put out of the [[church]], was
pronounced by the apostle, or pastor; but the [[judgment]] concerning the
merit of the cause, was in the [[church]]; that is to say, (as the times
were before the conversion of kings [[king]], and [[men]] that had soveraign
authority in the common-wealth,) the assembly of the christians [[christian]] dwelling
in the same [[city]]; as in corinth, in the assembly of the christians [[christian]] of
corinth.




of excommunication

this part of the [[power]] of the keyes, by which [[men]] were thrust out from
the kingdome of [[god]], is that which is called excommunication; and to
excommunicate, is in the originall, aposunagogon poiein, to cast out of
the synagogue; that is, out of the place of [[divine]] service; a word drawn
from the custom of the [[jews]], to cast out of their synagogues, such as
they [[thought]] in manners, or doctrine, contagious, as lepers were by the
law of [[moses]] separated from the congregation of [[israel]], till such time
as they should be by the [[priest]] pronounced clean.




the use of excommunication without civill [[power]].

the use and effect of excommunication, whilest it was not yet
strengthened with the civill [[power]], was no more, than that they, who
were not excommunicate, were to avoid the company of them that were.
it was not enough to repute them as heathen, that never had been
christians; for with such they might eate, and drink; which with
excommunicate persons [[person]] they might not do; as appeareth by the words of
st. paul, (1 cor. 5. ver. 9, 10, &c.) where he telleth them, he had
formerly forbidden them to "company with fornicators;" but (because that
could not bee without going out of the [[world]],) he restraineth it to such
fornicators, and otherwise vicious persons [[person]], as were of the brethren [[brother]];
"with such a one" (he saith) they ought not to keep company, "no, not to
eat." and this is no more than our saviour saith (mat. 18.17.) "let
him be to thee as a heathen, and as a publican." for publicans (which
signifieth farmers [[farmer]], and receivers of the [[revenue]] of the common-wealth)
were so hated, and detested by the [[jews]] that were to [[pay]] for it, as
that publican and sinner were taken amongst them for the same thing:
insomuch, as when our saviour accepted the invitation of zacchaeus a
publican; though it were to convert him, yet it was objected to him as
a crime. and therefore, when our saviour, to heathen, added publican, he
did forbid them to [[eat]] with a [[man]] excommunicate.

as for keeping them out of their synagogues, or places of assembly, they
had no [[power]] to do it, but that of the owner of the place, whether he
were [[christian]], or heathen. and because all places are by [[right]], in the
dominion of the common-wealth; as well hee that was excommunicated, as
hee that never was baptized, might enter into them by commission from
the civill magistrate; as paul before his conversion entred into their
synagogues at damascus, (acts 9.2.) to apprehend christians [[christian]], [[men]] and
women, and to carry them bound to [[jerusalem]], by commission from the high
priest.




of no effect upon an apostate

by which it appears, that upon a [[christian]], that should become an
apostate, in a place where the civill [[power]] did [[persecute]], or not assist
the [[church]], the effect of excommunication had nothing in it, neither of
dammage in this [[world]], nor of terrour: not of terrour, because of their
unbeleef; nor of dammage, because they returned thereby into the favour
of the [[world]]; and in the [[world]] to come, were to be in no worse estate,
then they which never had beleeved. the dammage redounded rather to the
church, by provocation of them they cast out, to a freer execution of
their malice.




but upon the faithfull only

excommunication therefore had its effect onely upon those, that beleeved
that [[jesus]] [[christ]] was to come again in [[glory]], to reign over, and to
judge both the quick, and the [[dead]], and should therefore refuse entrance
into his [[kingdom]], to those whose sins [[sin]] were retained; that is, to those
that were excommunicated by the [[church]]. and thence it is that st. paul
calleth excommunication, a delivery of the excommunicate [[person]] to
satan. for without the [[kingdom]] of [[christ]], all other kingdomes after
judgment, are comprehended in the kingdome of [[satan]]. this is it that the
faithfull stood in [[fear]] of, as long as they stood excommunicate, that is
to say, in an estate wherein their sins [[sin]] were not forgiven. whereby wee
may [[understand]], that excommunication in the [[time]] that [[christian]] religion
was not authorized by the civill [[power]], was used onely for a correction
of manners, not of errours in [[opinion]]: for it is a [[punishment]], whereof
none could be sensible but such as beleeved, and expected the coming
again of our saviour to [[judge]] the [[world]]; and they who so beleeved,
needed no other [[opinion]], but onely uprightnesse of [[life]], to be saved.




for what [[fault]] lyeth excommunication

there lyeth excommunication for [[injustice]]; as (mat. 18.) if thy brother
offend thee, tell it him privately; then with witnesses; lastly, tell
the [[church]]; and then if he obey not, "let him be to thee as an heathen
man, and a publican." and there lyeth excommunication for a scandalous
life, as (1 cor. 5. 11.) "if any [[man]] that is called a [[brother]], be
a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a drunkard, or an
extortioner, with such a one yee are not to [[eat]]." but to excommunicate a
man that held this foundation, that [[jesus]] was the [[christ]], for difference
of [[opinion]] in other points, by which that foundation was not destroyed,
there appeareth no [[authority]] in the [[scripture]], nor [[example]] in the
apostles. there is indeed in st. paul (titus 3.10.) a text that seemeth
to be to the contrary. "a [[man]] that is an haeretique, after the first
and second admonition, reject." for an haeretique, is he, that being a
member of the [[church]], teacheth neverthelesse some private [[opinion]], which
the [[church]] has forbidden: and such a one, s. paul adviseth titus, after
the first, and second admonition, to reject. but to reject (in this
place) is not to excommunicate the [[man]]; but to give over admonishing
him, to let him alone, to set by disputing with him, as one that is to
be convinced onely by himselfe. the same apostle saith (2 tim. 2.23.)
"foolish and unlearned questions [[question]] avoid;" the word avoid in this place,
and reject in the former, is the same in the originall, paraitou: but
foolish questions [[question]] may bee set by without excommunication. and again,
(tit. 3.93) "avoid foolish questions [[question]]," where the originall, periistaso,
(set them by) is equivalent to the former word reject. there is no
other place that can so much as colourably be drawn, to countenance
the casting out of the [[church]] faithfull [[men]], such as beleeved the
foundation, onely for a singular superstructure of their own, proceeding
perhaps from a [[good]] & pious [[conscience]]. but on the contrary, all such
places as command avoiding such disputes, are written for a lesson to
pastors, (such as timothy and titus were) not to make new articles of
faith, by determining every small controversie, which oblige [[men]] to a
needlesse burthen of [[conscience]], or provoke them to break the union of
the [[church]]. which lesson the [[apostles]] themselves observed well. s. peter
and s. paul, though their controversie were [[great]], (as we may read
in gal. 2.11.) yet they did not cast one another out of the [[church]].
neverthelesse, during the [[apostles]] [[time]], there were other [[pastors]] that
observed it not; as diotrephes (3 john 9. &c.) who cast out of the
church, such as s. john himself [[thought]] fit to be received into it, out
of a [[pride]] he took in praeeminence; so early it was, that vainglory, and
ambition had found entrance into the [[church]] of [[christ]].




of persons [[person]] liable to excommunication

that a [[man]] be liable to excommunication, there be many conditions
requisite; as first, that he be a member of some commonalty, that is to
say, of some lawfull assembly, that is to say, of some christian
church, that hath [[power]] to [[judge]] of the cause for which hee is to
bee excommunicated. for where there is no [[community]], there can bee no
excommunication; nor where there is no [[power]] to [[judge]], can there bee any
power to give sentence. from hence it followeth, that one [[church]] cannot
be excommunicated by another: for either they have equall power
to excommunicate each other, in which case excommunication is not
discipline, nor an act of [[authority]], but schisme, and dissolution of
charity; or one is so subordinate to the other, as that they both
have but one voice, and then they be but one [[church]]; and the part
excommunicated, is no more a [[church]], but a dissolute number of
individuall persons [[person]].

and because the sentence of excommunication, importeth an [[advice]], not to
keep company, nor so much as to [[eat]] with him that is excommunicate, if
a soveraign [[prince]], or assembly bee excommunicate, the sentence is of no
effect. for all subjects [[subject]] are bound to be in the company and presence of
their own soveraign (when he requireth it) by the [[law]] of [[nature]]; nor
can they lawfully either expell him from any place of his own dominion,
whether profane or holy; nor go out of his dominion, without his leave;
much lesse (if he call them to that [[honour]],) refuse to [[eat]] with him. and
as to other princes [[prince]] and states, because they are not parts of one and
the same congregation, they need not any other sentence to keep
them from keeping company with the [[state]] excommunicate: for the
very institution, as it uniteth many [[men]] into one [[community]]; so it
dissociateth one [[community]] from another: so that excommunication is
not needfull for keeping kings [[king]] and states asunder; nor has any further
effect then is in the [[nature]] of policy it selfe; unlesse it be to
instigate princes [[prince]] to warre upon one another.

nor is the excommunication of a [[christian]] [[subject]], that obeyeth the laws
of his own soveraign, whether [[christian]], or heathen, of any effect. for
if he beleeve that "jesus is the [[christ]], he hath the spirit of god" (1
joh. 4.1.) "and [[god]] dwelleth in him, and he in [[god]]," (1 joh. 4.15.) but
hee that hath the spirit of [[god]]; hee that dwelleth in [[god]]; hee in
whom [[god]] dwelleth, can receive no harm by the excommunication of [[men]].
therefore, he that beleeveth [[jesus]] to be the [[christ]], is [[free]] from all
the dangers threatned to persons [[person]] excommunicate. he that beleeveth it
not, is no [[christian]]. therefore a true and unfeigned [[christian]] is not
liable to excommunication; nor he also that is a professed [[christian]],
till his hypocrisy appear in his manners, that is, till his behaviour
bee contrary to the [[law]] of his soveraign, which is the [[rule]] of manners,
and which [[christ]] and his [[apostles]] have commanded us to be [[subject]] to.
for the [[church]] cannot [[judge]] of manners but by externall actions, which
actions can never bee unlawfull, but when they are against the [[law]] of
the common-wealth.

if a mans [[man]] [[father]], or [[mother]], or master bee excommunicate, yet are not
the [[children]] forbidden to keep them company, nor to [[eat]] with them; for
that were (for the most part) to oblige them not to [[eat]] at all, for want
of means to get food; and to authorise them to disobey their parents,
and masters, contrary to the precept of the [[apostles]].

in summe, the [[power]] of excommunication cannot be extended further than
to the end for which the [[apostles]] and [[pastors]] of the [[church]] have
their commission from our saviour; which is not to [[rule]] by command and
coaction, but by teaching and direction of [[men]] in the way of salvation
in the [[world]] to come. and as a master in any [[science]], may abandon his
scholar, when hee obstinately neglecteth the practise of his rules [[rule]]; but
not accuse him of [[injustice]], because he was never bound to obey him:
so a teacher of [[christian]] doctrine may abandon his disciples that
obstinately continue in an unchristian [[life]]; but he cannot say, they doe
him [[wrong]], because they are not obliged to obey him: for to a teacher
that shall so [[complain]], may be applyed the [[answer]] of [[god]] to samuel in
the like place, (1 sam. 8.) "they have not rejected thee, but mee."
excommunication therefore when it wanteth the assistance of the civill
power, as it doth, when a [[christian]] [[state]], or [[prince]] is excommunicate
by a forain [[authority]], is without effect; and consequently ought to
be without terrour. the name of fulmen excommunicationis (that is, the
thunderbolt of excommunication) proceeded from an [[imagination]] of the
bishop of [[rome]], which first used it, that he was [[king]] of kings [[king]], as the
heathen made [[jupiter]] [[king]] of the gods; and assigned him in their poems,
and pictures, a thunderbolt, wherewith to subdue, and punish the giants,
that should dare to deny his [[power]]: which [[imagination]] was grounded on
two errours; one, that the kingdome of [[christ]] is of this [[world]], contrary
to our saviours owne words, "my kingdome is not of this [[world]];" the
other, that hee is christs vicar, not onely over his owne subjects [[subject]],
but over all the christians [[christian]] of the [[world]]; whereof there is no ground in
scripture, and the contrary shall bee proved in its due place.




of the interpreter of the scriptures [[scripture]] before civill soveraigns became
christians

st. paul coming to thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the [[jews]],
(acts 17.2, 3.) "as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath
dayes reasoned with them out of the scriptures [[scripture]], opening and alledging,
that [[christ]] must needs have [[suffered]] and risen again from the [[dead]]; and
that this [[jesus]] whom he preached was the [[christ]]." the scriptures [[scripture]] here
mentioned were the scriptures [[scripture]] of the [[jews]], that is, the old testament.
the [[men]], to whom he was to prove that [[jesus]] was the [[christ]], and risen
again from the [[dead]], were also [[jews]], and did beleeve already, that
they were the word of [[god]]. hereupon (as it is verse 4.) some of them
beleeved, and (as it is in the 5. ver.) some beleeved not. what was
the [[reason]], when they all beleeved the [[scripture]], that they did not
all beleeve alike; but that some approved, others disapproved the
interpretation of st. paul that cited them; and every one interpreted
them to himself? it was this; s. paul came to them without any legall
commission, and in the manner of one that would not command, but
perswade; which he must needs do, either by [[miracles]], as [[moses]] did
to the israelites in [[egypt]], that they might see his [[authority]] in gods
works; or by reasoning from the already received [[scripture]], that
they might see the [[truth]] of his doctrine in gods word. but whosoever
perswadeth by reasoning from principles [[principle]] written, maketh him to whom hee
speaketh [[judge]], both of the meaning of those principles [[principle]], and also of the
force of his inferences upon them. if these [[jews]] of thessalonica were
not, who else was the [[judge]] of what s. paul alledged out of [[scripture]]?
if s. paul, what needed he to quote any places to prove his doctrine? it
had been enough to have said, i find it so in [[scripture]], that is to
say, in your laws [[law]], of which i am interpreter, as sent by [[christ]]. the
interpreter therefore of the [[scripture]], to whose interpretation the
jews of thessalonica were bound to stand, could be none: every one might
beleeve, or not beleeve, according as the allegations seemed to himselfe
to be agreeable, or not agreeable to the meaning of the places alledged.
and generally in all cases of the [[world]], hee that pretendeth any proofe,
maketh [[judge]] of his proofe him to whom he addresseth his [[speech]]. and as
to the case of the [[jews]] in particular, they were bound by expresse words
(deut. 17.) to receive the determination of all hard questions [[question]], from
the priests [[priest]] and judges [[judge]] of [[israel]] for the [[time]] being. but this is to bee
understood of the [[jews]] that were yet unconverted.

for the conversion of the gentiles, there was no use of alledging the
scriptures, which they beleeved not. the [[apostles]] therefore laboured by
reason to confute their idolatry; and that done, to perswade them to the
faith of [[christ]], by their testimony of his [[life]], and resurrection. so
that there could not yet bee any controversie concerning the authority
to interpret [[scripture]]; seeing no [[man]] was obliged during his infidelity,
to [[follow]] any mans [[man]] interpretation of any [[scripture]], except his
soveraigns interpretation of the laws [[law]] of his countrey.

let us now consider the conversion it [[self]], and see what there was
therein, that could be cause of such an obligation. [[men]] were converted
to no other thing then to the beleef of that which the apostles
preached: and the [[apostles]] preached nothing, but that [[jesus]] was the
christ, that is to say, the [[king]] that was to save them, and reign over
them eternally in the [[world]] to come; and consequently that hee was not
dead, but risen again from the [[dead]], and gone up into [[heaven]], and should
come again one day to judg the [[world]], (which also should rise again to
be judged,) and [[reward]] every [[man]] according to his works [[work]]. none of them
preached that himselfe, or any other apostle was such an interpreter
of the [[scripture]], as all that became christians [[christian]], ought to take their
interpretation for [[law]]. for to interpret the laws [[law]], is part of the
administration of a [[present]] kingdome; which the [[apostles]] had not. they
prayed then, and all other [[pastors]] ever since, "let thy kingdome come;"
and exhorted their converts to obey their then ethnique princes [[prince]]. the new
testament was not yet published in one [[body]]. every of the evangelists
was interpreter of his own gospel; and every apostle of his own epistle;
and of the old testament, our saviour himselfe saith to the [[jews]] (john
5. 39.) "search the scriptures [[scripture]]; for in them yee thinke to have eternall
life, and they are they that testifie of me." if hee had not meant they
should interpret them, hee would not have bidden them take thence the
proof of his being the [[christ]]; he would either have interpreted them
himselfe, or referred them to the interpretation of the priests [[priest]].

when a difficulty arose, the [[apostles]] and elders of the [[church]] assembled
themselves together, and determined what should bee preached, and
taught, and how they should interpret the scriptures [[scripture]] to the [[people]];
but took not from the [[people]] the [[liberty]] to [[read]], and interpret them to
themselves. the [[apostles]] sent divers letters to the churches [[church]], and other
writings for their instruction; which had been in [[vain]], if they had not
allowed them to interpret, that is, to consider the meaning of them.
and as it was in the [[apostles]] [[time]], it must be till such [[time]] as
there should be [[pastors]], that could authorise an interpreter, whose
interpretation should generally be stood to: but that could not be till
kings were [[pastors]], or [[pastors]] kings [[king]].




of the [[power]] to make [[scripture]] law

there be two senses, wherein a writing may be said to be canonicall;
for canon, signifieth a [[rule]]; and a [[rule]] is a precept, by which a man
is guided, and directed in any action whatsoever. such precepts, though
given by a teacher to his disciple, or a counsellor to his friend,
without [[power]] to compell him to observe them, are neverthelesse canons;
because they are rules [[rule]]: but when they are given by one, whom he that
receiveth them is bound to obey, then are those canons, not onely rules [[rule]],
but laws [[law]]: the [[question]] therefore here, is of the [[power]] to make the
scriptures (which are the rules [[rule]] of [[christian]] faith) laws [[law]].




of the ten commandements

that part of the [[scripture]], which was first [[law]], was the ten
commandements, written in two tables of stone, and delivered by god
himselfe to [[moses]]; and by [[moses]] made known to the [[people]]. before that
time there was no written [[law]] of [[god]], who as yet having not chosen any
people to bee his peculiar kingdome, had given no [[law]] to [[men]], but the
law of [[nature]], that is to say, the precepts of naturall [[reason]], written
in every mans [[man]] own [[heart]]. of these two tables, the first containeth the
law of soveraignty; 1. that they should not obey, nor [[honour]] the gods of
other nations, in these words, "non habebis deos alienos coram me," that
is, "thou shalt not have for gods, the gods that other nations [[worship]];
but onely me:" whereby they were forbidden to obey, or [[honor]], as their
king and governour, any other [[god]], than him that spake unto them then by
moses, and afterwards by the high [[priest]]. 2. that they "should not make
any image to represent him;" that is to say, they were not to choose to
themselves, neither in [[heaven]], nor in [[earth]], any representative of their
own fancying, but obey [[moses]] and aaron, whom he had appointed to that
office. 3. that "they should not take the name of [[god]] in [[vain]];" that is,
they should not speak rashly of their [[king]], nor dispute his [[right]],
nor the commissions of [[moses]] and aaron, his lieutenants. 4. that "they
should every seventh day abstain from their ordinary [[labour]]," and employ
that [[time]] in doing him publique [[honor]]. the second table containeth the
duty of one [[man]] towards another, as "to [[honor]] parents; not to kill;
not to commit adultery; not to steale; not to [[corrupt]] [[judgment]] by false
witnesse;" and finally, "not so much as to designe in their [[heart]] the
doing of any injury one to another." the [[question]] now is, who it was
that gave to these written tables the obligatory [[force]] of lawes. there
is no [[doubt]] but that they were made laws [[law]] by [[god]] himselfe: but because a
law obliges not, nor is [[law]] to any, but to them that acknowledge it to
be the act of the soveraign, how could the [[people]] of [[israel]] that were
forbidden to approach the mountain to hear what [[god]] said to [[moses]], be
obliged to [[obedience]] to all those laws [[law]] which [[moses]] propounded to them?
some of them were indeed the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], as all the second table;
and therefore to be acknowledged for gods laws [[law]]; not to the israelites
alone, but to all [[people]]: but of those that were peculiar to the
israelites, as those of the first table, the [[question]] remains; saving
that they had obliged themselves, presently after the propounding of
them, to obey [[moses]], in these words (exod. 20.19.) "speak them thou to
us, and we will hear thee; but let not [[god]] speak to us, lest we [[die]]." it
was therefore onely [[moses]] then, and after him the high [[priest]], whom (by
moses) [[god]] declared should administer this his peculiar kingdome, that
had on [[earth]], the [[power]] to make this short [[scripture]] of the decalogue
to bee [[law]] in the common-wealth of [[israel]]. but [[moses]], and aaron, and the
succeeding high priests [[priest]] were the civill soveraigns. therefore hitherto,
the canonizing, or making of the [[scripture]] [[law]], belonged to the civill
soveraigne.




of the judicial, and leviticall law

the judiciall [[law]], that is to say, the laws [[law]] that [[god]] prescribed to the
magistrates of [[israel]], for the [[rule]] of their administration of [[justice]],
and of the sentences, or judgments [[judgment]] they should pronounce, in pleas
between [[man]] and [[man]]; and the leviticall [[law]], that is to say, the rule
that [[god]] prescribed touching the rites and ceremonies [[ceremony]] of the priests [[priest]] and
levites, were all delivered to them by [[moses]] onely; and therefore also
became lawes, by vertue of the same promise of [[obedience]] to [[moses]].
whether these laws [[law]] were then written, or not written, but dictated to
the [[people]] by [[moses]] (after his forty dayes being with [[god]] in the mount)
by word of mouth, is not expressed in the text; but they were all
positive laws [[law]], and equivalent to holy [[scripture]], and made canonicall by
moses the civill soveraign.




the second law

after the israelites were come into the plains of moab over against
jericho, and ready to enter into the [[land]] of promise, [[moses]] to the
former laws [[law]] added divers others; which therefore are called deuteronomy:
that is, second laws [[law]]. and are (as it is written, deut. 29.1.) "the words
of a covenant which the [[lord]] commanded [[moses]] to make with the children
of [[israel]], besides the covenant which he made with them in horeb." for
having explained those former laws [[law]], in the beginning of the [[book]] of
deuteronomy, he addeth others, that begin at the 12. cha. and continue
to the end of the 26. of the same [[book]]. this [[law]] (deut. 27.1.) they were
commanded to write upon [[great]] stones playstered over, at their passing
over jordan: this [[law]] also was written by [[moses]] himself in a [[book]]; and
delivered into the hands of the "priests, and to the elders of [[israel]],"
(deut. 31.9.) and commanded (ve. 26.) "to be put in the side of the
arke;" for in the ark it selfe was nothing but the ten commandements.
this was the [[law]], which [[moses]] (deuteronomy 17.18.) commanded the kings
of [[israel]] should keep a copie of: and this is the [[law]], which having been
long [[time]] lost, was found again in the temple in the [[time]] of josiah,
and by his [[authority]] received for the [[law]] of [[god]]. but both [[moses]] at the
writing, and josiah at the recovery thereof, had both of them the
civill soveraignty. hitherto therefore the [[power]] of making scripture
canonicall, was in the civill soveraign.

besides this [[book]] of the [[law]], there was no other [[book]], from the [[time]] of
moses, till after the captivity, received amongst the [[jews]] for the
law of [[god]]. for the prophets [[prophet]] (except a few) lived in the [[time]] of the
captivity it selfe; and the rest lived but a little before it; and were
so far from having their prophecies generally received for laws [[law]], as that
their persons [[person]] were persecuted, partly by false prophets [[prophet]], and partly by
the kings [[king]] which were seduced by them. and this [[book]] it [[self]], which was
confirmed by josiah for the [[law]] of [[god]], and with it all the [[history]] of
the works [[work]] of [[god]], was lost in the captivity, and sack of the [[city]] of
jerusalem, as appears by that of 2 esdras 14.21. "thy [[law]] is burnt;
therefor no [[man]] knoweth the things that are done of thee, of the works
that shall begin." and before the captivity, between the [[time]] when the
law was lost, (which is not mentioned in the [[scripture]], but may probably
be [[thought]] to be the [[time]] of rehoboam, when shishak [[king]] of [[egypt]] took
the spoils of the temple,(1 kings [[king]] 14.26.)) and the [[time]] of josiah,
when it was found againe, they had no written word of [[god]], but ruled
according to their own discretion, or by the direction of such, as each
of them esteemed prophets [[prophet]].




the old testament, when made canonicall

from whence we may inferre, that the scriptures [[scripture]] of the old testament,
which we have at this day, were not canonicall, nor a [[law]] unto the [[jews]],
till the renovation of their covenant with [[god]] at their return from the
captivity, and restauration of their common-wealth under esdras. but
from that [[time]] forward they were accounted the [[law]] of the [[jews]], and for
such translated into [[greek]] by seventy elders of judaea, and put into the
library of ptolemy at alexandria, and approved for the word of [[god]]. now
seeing esdras was the high [[priest]], and the high [[priest]] was their civill
soveraigne, it is manifest, that the scriptures [[scripture]] were never made laws [[law]],
but by the soveraign civill [[power]].

the new testament began to be canonicall under [[christian]] soveraigns by
the writings of the fathers [[father]] that lived in the [[time]] before that christian
religion was received, and authorised by constantine the emperour, we
may find, that the books [[book]] wee now have of the new testament, were held by
the christians [[christian]] of that [[time]] (except a few, in [[respect]] of whose paucity
the rest were called the catholique [[church]], and others haeretiques) for
the dictates of the holy ghost; and consequently for the canon, or rule
of [[faith]]: such was the reverence and [[opinion]] they had of their teachers;
as generally the reverence that the disciples bear to their first
masters, in all manner of doctrine they receive from them, is not small.
therefore there is no [[doubt]], but when s. paul wrote to the churches [[church]] he
had converted; or any other apostle, or disciple of [[christ]], to those
which had then embraced [[christ]], they received those their writings for
the true [[christian]] doctrine. but in that [[time]], when not the [[power]] and
authority of the teacher, but the [[faith]] of the hearer caused them
to receive it, it was not the [[apostles]] that made their own writings
canonicall, but every convert made them so to himself.

but the [[question]] here, is not what any [[christian]] made a [[law]], or canon
to himself, (which he might again reject, by the same [[right]] he received
it;) but what was so made a canon to them, as without [[injustice]] they
could not doe any thing contrary thereunto. that the new testament
should in this sense be canonicall, that is to say, a [[law]] in any place
where the [[law]] of the common-wealth had not made it so, is contrary to
the [[nature]] of a [[law]]. for a [[law]], (as hath been already shewn) is the
commandement of that [[man]], or assembly, to whom we have given soveraign
authority, to make such rules [[rule]] for the direction of our actions, as hee
shall [[think]] fit; and to punish us, when we doe any thing contrary to the
same. when therefore any other [[man]] shall offer unto us any other rules [[rule]],
which the soveraign ruler hath not prescribed, they are but counsell,
and [[advice]]; which, whether [[good]], or [[bad]], hee that is counselled, may
without [[injustice]] refuse to observe, and when contrary to the laws
already established, without [[injustice]] cannot observe, how [[good]] soever
he conceiveth it to be. i say, he cannot in this case observe the same
in his actions, nor in his discourse with other [[men]]; though he may
without blame beleeve the his private teachers, and [[wish]] he had the
liberty to practise their [[advice]]; and that it were publiquely received
for [[law]]. for internall [[faith]] is in its own [[nature]] invisible, and
consequently exempted from all humane jurisdiction; whereas the words,
and actions that proceed from it, as breaches of our civil [[obedience]],
are [[injustice]] both before [[god]] and [[man]]. seeing then our saviour hath
denyed his kingdome to be in this [[world]], seeing he hath said, he came
not to [[judge]], but to save the [[world]], he hath not subjected us to other
laws than those of the common-wealth; that is, the [[jews]] to the law
of [[moses]], (which he saith (mat. 5.) he came not to [[destroy]], but to
fulfill,) and other nations to the laws [[law]] of their severall soveraigns,
and all [[men]] to the laws [[law]] of [[nature]]; the observing whereof, both he
himselfe, and his [[apostles]] have in their teaching recommended to us, as
a necessary condition of being admitted by him in the [[last]] day into his
eternall kingdome, wherein shall be protection, and [[life]] everlasting.
seeing then our saviour, and his [[apostles]], left not new laws [[law]] to oblige
us in this [[world]], but new doctrine to prepare us for the next; the books
of the new testament, which containe that doctrine, untill [[obedience]] to
them was commanded, by them that [[god]] hath given [[power]] to on [[earth]] to be
legislators, were not obligatory canons, that is, laws [[law]], but onely [[good]],
and safe [[advice]], for the direction of sinners in the way to salvation,
which every [[man]] might take, and refuse at his owne perill, without
injustice.

again, our saviour christs commission to his [[apostles]], and disciples,
was to proclaim his kingdome (not [[present]], but) to come; and to teach
all nations; and to baptize them that should beleeve; and to enter into
the houses of them that should receive them; and where they were not
received, to shake off the dust of their feet against them; but not
to call for [[fire]] from [[heaven]] to [[destroy]] them, nor to compell them to
obedience by the [[sword]]. in all which there is nothing of [[power]], but of
perswasion. he sent them out as sheep unto wolves, not as kings [[king]] to their
subjects. they had not in commission to make laws [[law]]; but to obey, and
teach [[obedience]] to laws [[law]] made; and consequently they could not make their
writings obligatory canons, without the [[help]] of the soveraign civill
power. and therefore the [[scripture]] of the new testament is there only
law, where the lawfull civill [[power]] hath made it so. and there also the
king, or soveraign, maketh it a [[law]] to himself; by which he subjecteth
himselfe, not to the doctor, or apostle, that converted him, but to god
himself, and his [[son]] [[jesus]] [[christ]], as immediately as did the apostles
themselves.




of the [[power]] of councells to make the [[scripture]] law

that which may seem to give the new testament, in [[respect]] of those that
have embraced [[christian]] doctrine, the [[force]] of laws [[law]], in the times [[time]], and
places of persecution, is the decrees they made amongst themselves in
their synods. for we [[read]] (acts 15.28.) the stile of the councell of the
apostles, the elders, and the whole [[church]], in this manner, "it seemed
good to the holy ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen
than these necessary things, &c." which is a stile that signifieth a
power to lay a burthen on them that had received their doctrine. now
"to lay a burthen on another," seemeth the same that "to oblige;" and
therefore the acts of that councell were laws [[law]] to the then christians [[christian]].
neverthelesse, they were no more laws [[law]] than are these other precepts,
"repent, be baptized; keep the commandements; beleeve the gospel; come
unto me; sell all that thou hast; give it to the [[poor]];" and "follow
me;" which are not commands, but invitations, and callings of [[men]] to
christianity, like that of esay 55.1. "ho, every [[man]] that thirsteth,
come yee to the waters, come, and buy wine and milke without [[money]]."
for first, the [[apostles]] [[power]] was no other than that of our saviour,
to invite [[men]] to embrace the kingdome of [[god]]; which they themselves
acknowledged for a kingdome (not [[present]], but) to come; and they that
have no kingdome, can make no laws [[law]]. and secondly, if their acts of
councell, were laws [[law]], they could not without [[sin]] be disobeyed. but we
read not any where, that they who received not the doctrine of [[christ]],
did therein [[sin]]; but that they died in their sins [[sin]]; that is, that their
sins against the laws [[law]] to which they owed [[obedience]], were not pardoned.
and those laws [[law]] were the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], and the civill laws [[law]] of the
state, whereto every [[christian]] [[man]] had by pact submitted himself. and
therefore by the burthen, which the [[apostles]] might lay on such as they
had converted, are not to be understood laws [[law]], but conditions, proposed
to those that sought salvation; which they might accept, or refuse at
their own perill, without a new [[sin]], though not without the hazard of
being condemned, and excluded out of the kingdome of [[god]] for their sins
past. and therefore of infidels, s. john saith not, the wrath of god
shall "come" upon them, but "the wrath of [[god]] remaineth upon them;"
and not that they shall be condemned; but that "they are condemned
already."(john 3.36, 3.18) nor can it be conceived, that the benefit
of [[faith]], "is remission of sins" unlesse we conceive withall, that the
dammage of infidelity, is "the retention of the same sins [[sin]]."

but to what end is it (may some [[man]] aske), that the [[apostles]], and other
pastors of the [[church]], after their [[time]], should meet together, to agree
upon what doctrine should be taught, both for [[faith]] and manners, if no
man were obliged to observe their decrees? to this may be answered, that
the [[apostles]], and elders of that councell, were obliged even by their
entrance into it, to [[teach]] the doctrine therein concluded, and decreed
to be taught, so far forth, as no precedent [[law]], to which they were
obliged to yeeld [[obedience]], was to the contrary; but not that all other
christians should be obliged to observe, what they taught. for though
they might deliberate what each of them should [[teach]]; yet they could
not deliberate what others should do, unless their assembly had had
a legislative [[power]]; which none could have but civill soveraigns. for
though [[god]] be the soveraign of all the [[world]], we are not bound to take
for his [[law]], whatsoever is propounded by every [[man]] in his name; nor any
thing contrary to the civill [[law]], which [[god]] hath expressely commanded us
to obey.

seeing then the acts of councell of the [[apostles]], were then no laws [[law]],
but councells; much lesse are laws [[law]] the acts of any other doctors,
or councells since, if assembled without the [[authority]] of the civill
soveraign. and consequently, the books [[book]] of the new testament, though most
perfect rules [[rule]] of [[christian]] doctrine, could not be made laws [[law]] by any other
authority then that of kings [[king]], or soveraign assemblies.

the first councell, that made the scriptures [[scripture]] we now have, canon, is not
extant: for that collection the first bishop of [[rome]] after s. peter, is
subject to [[question]]: for though the canonicall books [[book]] bee there reckoned
up; yet these words, "sint vobis omnibus clericis & laicis libris
venerandi, &c." containe a distinction of clergy, and laity, that was
not in use so neer st. peters [[time]]. the first councell for setling the
canonicall [[scripture]], that is extant, is that of laodicea, can. 59.
which forbids the reading of other books [[book]] then those in the churches [[church]];
which is a mandate that is not addressed to every [[christian]], but to
those onely that had [[authority]] to [[read]] any publiquely in the [[church]];
that is, to ecclesiastiques onely.




of the [[right]] of constituting ecclesiasticall officers in the [[time]] of
the apostles

of ecclesiastical officers in the [[time]] of the [[apostles]], some were
magisteriall, some ministeriall. magisteriall were the offices
of preaching of the gospel of the [[kingdom]] of [[god]] to infidels; of
administring the sacraments, and [[divine]] service; and of teaching the
rules of [[faith]] and manners to those that were converted. ministeriall
was the office of deacons, that is, of them that were appointed to the
administration of the secular necessities of the [[church]], at such time
as they lived upon a [[common]] stock of mony, raised out of the voluntary
contributions of the faithfull.

amongst the officers magisteriall, the first, and principall were the
apostles; whereof there were at first but twelve; and these were chosen
and constituted by our saviour himselfe; and their office was not onely
to preach, [[teach]], and baptize, but also to be martyrs, (witnesses of
our saviours resurrection.) this testimony, was the specificall, and
essentiall mark; whereby the apostleship was distinguished from other
magistracy ecclesiasticall; as being necessary for an apostle, either to
have seen our saviour after his resurrection, or to have conversed with
him before, and seen his works [[work]], and other arguments of his divinity,
whereby they might be taken for sufficient witnesses. and therefore at
the election of a new apostle in the place of judas iscariot, s. peter
saith (acts 1.21,22.) "of these [[men]] that have companyed with us, all the
time that the [[lord]] [[jesus]] went in and out among us, beginning from the
baptisme of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must
one be ordained to be a witnesse with us of his resurrection:" where, by
this word must, is implyed a necessary [[property]] of an apostle, to have
companyed with the first and prime [[apostles]] in the [[time]] that our saviour
manifested himself in the flesh.




matthias made apostle by the congregation.

the first apostle, of those which were not constituted by [[christ]] in the
time he was upon the [[earth]], was matthias, chosen in this manner: there
were assembled together in [[jerusalem]] about 120 christians [[christian]] (acts 1.15.)
these appointed two, joseph the just, and matthias (ver. 23.) and caused
lots to be drawn; "and (ver. 26.) the lot fell on matthias and he was
numbred with the [[apostles]]." so that here we see the ordination of this
apostle, was the act of the congregation, and not of st. peter, nor of
the eleven, otherwise then as members of the assembly.




paul and barnabas made [[apostles]] by the [[church]] of antioch

after him there was never any other apostle ordained, but paul and
barnabas, which was done (as we [[read]] acts 13.1,2,3.) in this manner.
"there were in the [[church]] that was at antioch, certaine prophets [[prophet]], and
teachers; as barnabas, and simeon that was called niger, and lucius of
cyrene, and manaen; which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch,
and saul. as they ministred unto the [[lord]], and fasted, the holy ghost
said, ‘separate mee barnabas, and saul for the worke whereunto i have
called them.’ and when they had fasted, and prayed, and laid their hands
on them, they sent them away."

by which it is manifest, that though they were called by the holy ghost,
their calling was declared unto them, and their mission authorized by
the particular [[church]] of antioch. and that this their calling was to
the apostleship, is apparent by that, that they are both called (acts
14.14.) [[apostles]]: and that it was by vertue of this act of the [[church]] of
antioch, that they were [[apostles]], s. paul declareth plainly (rom. 1.1.)
in that hee useth the word, which the holy ghost used at his calling:
for he stileth himself, "an apostle separated unto the gospel of [[god]];"
alluding to the words of the holy ghost, "separate me barnabas and saul,
&c." but seeing the [[work]] of an apostle, was to be a witnesse of
the resurrection of [[christ]], and [[man]] may here aske, how s. paul that
conversed not with our saviour before his passion, could [[know]] he was
risen. to which it is easily answered, that our saviour himself appeared
to him in the way to damascus, from [[heaven]], after his ascension; "and
chose him for a vessell to bear his name before the gentiles, and kings [[king]],
and [[children]] of [[israel]];" and consequently (having seen the [[lord]] after
his passion) was a competent witnesse of his resurrection: and as for
barnabas, he was a disciple before the passion. it is therefore evident
that paul, and barnabas were [[apostles]]; and yet chosen, and authorized
(not by the first [[apostles]] alone, but) by the [[church]] of antioch; as
matthias was chosen, and authorized by the [[church]] of [[jerusalem]].




what offices in the [[church]] are magisteriall

bishop, a word formed in our [[language]], out of the [[greek]] episcopus,
signifieth an overseer, or superintendent of any businesse, and
particularly a pastor or shepherd; and thence by metaphor was taken, not
only amongst the [[jews]] that were originally shepherds, but also amongst
the heathen, to signifie the office of a [[king]], or any other ruler,
or guide of [[people]], whether he ruled by laws [[law]], or doctrine. and so
the [[apostles]] were the first [[christian]] bishops, instituted by christ
himselfe: in which sense the apostleship of judas is called (acts 1.20.)
his bishoprick. and afterwards, when there were constituted elders in
the [[christian]] churches [[church]], with charge to guide christs flock by their
doctrine, and [[advice]]; these elders were also called bishops. timothy was
an elder (which word elder, in the new testament is a name of office, as
well as of [[age]];) yet he was also a bishop. and bishops were then content
with the title of elders. nay s. john himselfe, the apostle beloved of
our [[lord]], beginneth his second epistle with these words, "the elder to
the elect [[lady]]." by which it is evident, that bishop, pastor, elder,
doctor, that is to say, teacher, were but so many divers names of
the same office in the [[time]] of the [[apostles]]. for there was then no
government by coercion, but only by doctrine, and perswading. the
kingdome of [[god]] was yet to come, in a new [[world]]; so that there could
be no [[authority]] to compell in any [[church]], till the common-wealth
had embraced the [[christian]] [[faith]]; and consequently no [[diversity]] of
authority, though there were [[diversity]] of employments.

besides these magisteriall employments in the [[church]], namely [[apostles]],
bishops, elders, [[pastors]], and doctors, whose calling was to proclaim
christ to the [[jews]], and infidels, and to direct, and [[teach]] those that
beleeved we [[read]] in the new testament of no other. for by the names
of evangelists and prophets [[prophet]], is not signified any office, but severall
gifts, by which severall [[men]] were profitable to the [[church]]: as
evangelists, by writing the [[life]] and acts of our saviour; such as were
s. matthew and s. john [[apostles]], and s. marke and s. luke disciples, and
whosoever else wrote of that [[subject]], (as s. thomas, and s. barnabas are
said to have done, though the [[church]] have not received the books
that have gone under their names:) and as prophets [[prophet]], by the gift of
interpreting the old testament; and sometimes by declaring their
speciall revelations to the [[church]]. for neither these gifts, nor the
gifts of languages [[language]], nor the gift of casting out devils [[devil]], or of curing
other diseases, nor any thing else did make an officer in the [[church]],
save onely the due calling and election to the charge of teaching.




ordination of teachers

as the [[apostles]], matthias, paul, and barnabas, were not made by our
saviour himself, but were elected by the [[church]], that is, by the
assembly of christians [[christian]]; namely, matthias by the [[church]] of [[jerusalem]],
and paul, and barnabas by the [[church]] of antioch; so were also the
presbyters, and [[pastors]] in other cities [[city]], elected by the churches [[church]] of
those cities [[city]]. for proof whereof, let us consider, first, how s. paul
proceeded in the ordination of presbyters, in the cities [[city]] where he had
converted [[men]] to the [[christian]] [[faith]], immediately after he and barnabas
had received their apostleship. we [[read]] (acts 14.23.) that "they
ordained elders in every [[church]];" which at first sight may be taken for
an argument, that they themselves chose, and gave them their [[authority]]:
but if we consider the originall text, it will be manifest, that they
were authorized, and chosen by the assembly of the christians [[christian]] of each
city. for the words there are, "cheirotonesantes autoispresbuterous kat
ekklesian," that is, "when they had ordained them elders by the holding
up of hands in every congregation." now it is well enough known, that in
all those cities [[city]], the manner of choosing magistrates, and officers,
was by plurality of suffrages; and (because the ordinary way of
distinguishing the affirmative votes from the negatives, was by holding
up of hands) to ordain an officer in any of the cities [[city]], was no more
but to bring the [[people]] together, to elect them by plurality of votes,
whether it were by plurality of elevated hands, or by plurality of
voices, or plurality of balls, or beans, or small stones, of which every
man cast in one, into a vessell marked for the affirmative, or negative;
for divers cities [[city]] had divers customes in that point. it was therefore
the assembly that elected their own elders: the [[apostles]] were onely
presidents of the assembly to call them together for such election, and
to pronounce them elected, and to give them the benediction, which now
is called consecration. and for this cause they that were presidents
of the assemblies, as (in the absence of the apostles) the elders were,
were called proestotes, and in latin antistities; which words signifie
the principall [[person]] of the assembly, whose office was to number the
votes, and to declare thereby who was chosen; and where the votes were
equall, to decide the matter in [[question]], by adding his own; which is
the office of a president in councell. and (because all the churches
had their presbyters ordained in the same manner,) where the word is
constitute, (as titus 1.5.) "ina katasteses kata polin presbuterous,"
"for this cause left i thee in crete, that thou shouldest constitute
elders in every [[city]]," we are to [[understand]] the same thing; namely, that
hee should call the faithfull together, and ordain them presbyters by
plurality of suffrages. it had been a [[strange]] thing, if in a town, where
men perhaps had never seen any magistrate otherwise chosen then by an
assembly, those of the town becomming christians [[christian]], should so much as have
thought on any other way of election of their teachers, and guides, that
is to say, of their presbyters, (otherwise called bishops,) then this of
plurality of suffrages, intimated by s. paul (acts 14.23.) in the word
cheirotonesantes: nor was there ever any choosing of bishops, (before
the emperors [[emperor]] found it necessary to regulate them in order to the keeping
of the [[peace]] amongst them,) but by the assemblies of the christians [[christian]] in
every severall town.

the same is also confirmed by the continuall practise even to this day,
in the election of the bishops of [[rome]]. for if the bishop of any place,
had the [[right]] of choosing another, to the succession of the pastorall
office, in any [[city]], at such [[time]] as he went from thence, to plant the
same in another place; much more had he had the [[right]], to appoint his
successour in that place, in which he [[last]] resided and dyed: and we find
not, that ever any bishop of [[rome]] appointed his successor. for they were
a long [[time]] chosen by the [[people]], as we may see by the sedition raised
about the election, between damascus, and ursinicus; which ammianus
marcellinus saith was so [[great]], that juventius the praefect, unable to
keep the [[peace]] between them, was forced to goe out of the [[city]]; and that
there were above an hundred [[men]] found [[dead]] upon that [[occasion]] in the
church it [[self]]. and though they afterwards were chosen, first, by the
whole clergy of [[rome]], and afterwards by the cardinalls; yet never any
was appointed to the succession by his predecessor. if therefore they
pretended no [[right]] to appoint their successors, i [[think]] i may reasonably
conclude, they had no [[right]] to appoint the new [[power]]; which none could
take from the [[church]] to bestow on them, but such as had a lawfull
authority, not onely to [[teach]], but to command the [[church]]; which none
could doe, but the civill soveraign.




ministers of the [[church]] what

the word minister in the originall diakonos signifieth one that
voluntarily doth the businesse of another [[man]]; and differeth from a
servant onely in this, that servants are obliged by their condition,
to what is commanded them; whereas ministers are obliged onely by
their undertaking, and bound therefore to no more than that they have
undertaken: so that both they that [[teach]] the word of [[god]], and they that
administer the secular affairs of the [[church]], are both ministers, but
they are ministers of different persons [[person]]. for the [[pastors]] of the [[church]],
called (acts 6.4.) "the ministers of the word," are ministers of [[christ]],
whose word it is: but the ministery of a deacon, which is called (verse
2. of the same chapter) "serving of tables," is a service done to the
church, or congregation: so that neither any one [[man]], nor the whole
church, could ever of their pastor say, he was their minister; but of
a deacon, whether the charge he undertook were to serve tables, or
distribute maintenance to the christians [[christian]], when they lived in each city
on a [[common]] stock, or upon collections, as in the first times [[time]], or to
take a [[care]] of the house of prayer, or of the [[revenue]], or other worldly
businesse of the [[church]], the whole congregation might properly call him
their minister.

for their employment, as deacons, was to serve the congregation; though
upon [[occasion]] they omitted not to preach the gospel, and maintain the
doctrine of [[christ]], every one according to his gifts, as s. steven did;
and both to preach, and baptize, as philip did: for that philip, which
(act. 8. 5.) preached the gospel at samaria, and (verse 38.) baptized
the eunuch, was philip the deacon, not philip the apostle. for it is
manifest (verse 1.) that when philip preached in samaria, the apostles
were at [[jerusalem]], and (verse 14.) "when they heard that samaria had
received the word of [[god]], sent peter and john to them;" by imposition of
whose hands, they that were baptized (verse 15.) received (which before
by the baptisme of philip they had not received) the holy ghost. for it
was necessary for the conferring of the holy ghost, that their baptisme
should be administred, or confirmed by a minister of the word, not by a
minister of the [[church]]. and therefore to confirm the baptisme of those
that philip the deacon had baptized, the [[apostles]] sent out of their own
number from [[jerusalem]] to samaria, peter, and john; who conferred on them
that before were but baptized, those graces that were signs of the holy
spirit, which at that [[time]] did accompany all true beleevers; which what
they were may be understood by that which s. marke saith (chap. 16.17.)
"these signs [[follow]] them that beleeve in my name; they shall cast out
devills; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents,
and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall
lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." this to doe, was it that
philip could not give; but the [[apostles]] could, and (as appears by this
place) effectually did to every [[man]] that truly beleeved, and was by
a minister of [[christ]] himself baptized: which [[power]] either christs
ministers in this [[age]] cannot conferre, or else there are very few true
beleevers, or [[christ]] hath very few ministers.




and how chosen what

that the first deacons were chosen, not by the [[apostles]], but by a
congregation of the disciples; that is, of [[christian]] [[men]] of all sorts,
is manifest out of acts 6. where we [[read]] that the twelve, after the
number of disciples was multiplyed, called them together, and having
told them, that it was not fit that the [[apostles]] should leave the word
of [[god]], and serve tables, said unto them (verse 3.) "brethren looke you
out among you seven [[men]] of honest report, full of the holy ghost, and of
wisdome, whom we may appoint over this businesse." here it is manifest,
that though the [[apostles]] declared them elected; yet the congregation
chose them; which also, (verse the fift) is more expressely said, where
it is written, that "the saying pleased the multitude, and they chose
seven, &c."




of ecclesiasticall [[revenue]], under the [[law]] of moses

under the old testament, the tribe of levi were onely capable of the
priesthood, and other inferiour offices of the [[church]]. the land
was divided amongst the other tribes (levi excepted,) which by the
subdivision of the tribe of joseph, into ephraim and manasses, were
still twelve. to the tribe of levi were assigned [[certain]] cities [[city]] for
their habitation, with the suburbs for their cattell: but for their
portion, they were to have the tenth of the fruits of the [[land]] of their
brethren. again, the priests [[priest]] for their maintenance had the tenth of that
tenth, together with part of the oblations, and sacrifices [[sacrifice]]. for [[god]] had
said to aaron (numb. 18. 20.) "thou shalt have no [[inheritance]] in their
land, neither shalt thou have any part amongst them, i am thy part, and
thine [[inheritance]] amongst the [[children]] of [[israel]]." for [[god]] being then
king, and having constituted the tribe of levi to be his publique
ministers, he allowed them for their maintenance, the publique [[revenue]],
that is to say, the part that [[god]] had reserved to himself; which were
tythes, and offerings: and that it is which is meant, where [[god]] saith, i
am thine [[inheritance]]. and therefore to the levites might not unfitly
be attributed the name of clergy from kleros, which signifieth lot, or
inheritance; not that they were heirs of the kingdome of [[god]], more than
other; but that gods [[inheritance]], was their maintenance. now seeing
in this [[time]] [[god]] himself was their [[king]], and [[moses]], aaron, and the
succeeding high priests [[priest]] were his lieutenants; it is manifest, that the
right of tythes, and offerings was constituted by the civill [[power]].

after their rejection of [[god]] in the demand of a [[king]], they enjoyed still
the same [[revenue]]; but the [[right]] thereof was derived from that, that the
kings did never take it from them: for the publique [[revenue]] was at
the disposing of him that was the publique [[person]]; and that (till the
captivity) was the [[king]]. and again, after the return from the captivity,
they paid their tythes as before to the [[priest]]. hitherto therefore
church livings were determined by the civill soveraign.




in our saviours [[time]], and after

of the maintenance of our saviour, and his [[apostles]], we [[read]] onely they
had a purse, (which was carried by judas iscariot;) and, that of the
apostles, such as were fisher-men, did sometimes use their [[trade]]; and
that when our saviour sent the twelve [[apostles]] to preach, he forbad them
"to carry gold, and silver, and brasse in their purses, for that
the workman is worthy of his hire:" (mat. 10. 9,10.) by which it
is probable, their ordinary maintenance was not unsuitable to their
employment; for their employment was (ver. 8.) "freely to give, because
they had freely received;" and their maintenance was the [[free]] gift of
those that beleeved the [[good]] tyding they carryed about of the coming
of the messiah their saviour. to which we may adde, that which was
contributed out of gratitude, by such as our saviour had healed of
diseases; of which are mentioned "certain [[women]] (luke 8. 2,3.) which had
been healed of evill spirits and infirmities; [[mary]] magdalen, out of whom
went seven devills; and joanna the [[wife]] of chuza, herods steward; and
susanna, and many others, which ministred unto him of their substance.

after our saviours ascension, the christians [[christian]] of every [[city]] lived in
common, (acts 4. 34.) upon the mony which was made of the sale of their
lands and possessions, and laid down at the feet of the [[apostles]], of
good will, not of [[duty]]; for "whilest the [[land]] remained (saith s. peter
to ananias acts 5.4.) was it not thine? and after it was sold, was it
not in thy [[power]]?" which sheweth he needed not to have saved his [[land]],
nor his [[money]] by lying, as not being bound to contribute any thing at
all, unlesse he had pleased. and as in the [[time]] of the [[apostles]], so also
all the [[time]] downward, till after constantine the [[great]], we shall
find, that the maintenance of the bishops, and [[pastors]] of the christian
church, was nothing but the voluntary contribution of them that had
embraced their doctrine. there was yet no mention of tythes: but
such was in the [[time]] of constantine, and his sons [[son]], the affection of
christians to their [[pastors]], as ammianus marcellinus saith (describing
the sedition of damasus and ursinicus about the bishopricke,) that it
was worth their contention, in that the bishops of those times [[time]] by the
liberality of their flock, and especially of matrons, lived splendidly,
were carryed in coaches, and sumptuous in their fare and apparell.

the ministers of the gospel lived on the benevolence of their flocks
but here may some ask, whether the pastor were then bound to [[live]] upon
voluntary contribution, as upon almes, "for who (saith s. paul 1 cor. 9.
7.) goeth to [[war]] at his own charges? or who feedeth a flock, and eatheth
not of the milke of the flock?" and again, (1 cor. 9. 13.) "doe ye not
know that they which minister about holy things, [[live]] of the things of
the temple; and they which wait at the altar, partake with the altar;"
that is to say, have part of that which is offered at the altar for
their maintenance? and then he concludeth, "even so hath the lord
appointed, that they which preach the gospel should [[live]] of the gospel.
from which place may be inferred indeed, that the [[pastors]] of the church
ought to be maintained by their flocks; but not that the [[pastors]] were to
determine, either the quantity, or the [[kind]] of their own allowance, and
be (as it were) their own carvers. their allowance must needs therefore
be determined, either by the gratitude, and liberality of every
particular [[man]] of their flock, or by the whole congregation. by the
whole congregation it could not be, because their acts were then no
laws: therefore the maintenance of [[pastors]], before emperours and civill
soveraigns had made laws [[law]] to settle it, was nothing but benevolence. they
that served at the altar lived on what was offered. in what court should
they sue for it, who had no tribunalls? or if they had arbitrators
amongst themselves, who should execute their judgments [[judgment]], when they had no
power to arme their officers? it remaineth therefore, that there could
be no certaine maintenance assigned to any [[pastors]] of the [[church]], but by
the whole congregation; and then onely, when their decrees should have
the [[force]] (not onely of canons, but also) of laws [[law]]; which laws [[law]] could not
be made, but by emperours, kings [[king]], or other civill soveraignes. the right
of tythes in [[moses]] [[law]], could not be applyed to the then ministers
of the gospell; because [[moses]] and the high priests [[priest]] were the civill
soveraigns of the [[people]] under [[god]], whose [[kingdom]] amongst the [[jews]] was
present; whereas the kingdome of [[god]] by [[christ]] is yet to come.

hitherto hath been shewn what the [[pastors]] of the [[church]] are; what are
the points of their commission (as that they were to preach, to [[teach]],
to baptize, to be presidents in their severall congregations;) what is
ecclesiasticall censure, viz. excommunication, that is to say, in those
places where [[christianity]] was forbidden by the civill laws [[law]], a putting
of themselves out of the company of the excommunicate, and where
christianity was by the civill [[law]] commanded, a putting the
excommunicate out of the congregations of christians [[christian]]; who elected the
pastors and ministers of the [[church]], (that it was, the congregation);
who consecrated and blessed them, (that it was the pastor); what was
their due [[revenue]], (that it was none but their own possessions,
and their own [[labour]], and the voluntary contributions of devout and
gratefull christians). we are to consider now, what office those persons
have, who being civill soveraignes, have embraced also the christian
faith.




the civill soveraign being a [[christian]] hath the [[right]] of appointing
pastors

and first, we are to [[remember]], that the [[right]] of judging what
doctrines are fit for [[peace]], and to be taught the subjects [[subject]], is in all
common-wealths inseparably annexed (as hath been already proved cha.
18.) to the soveraign [[power]] civill, whether it be in one [[man]], or in one
assembly of [[men]]. for it is evident to the meanest capacity, that mens
actions are derived from the opinions [[opinion]] they have of the [[good]], or evill,
which from those actions redound unto themselves; and consequently,
men that are once possessed of an [[opinion]], that their [[obedience]] to
the soveraign [[power]], will bee more hurtfull to them, than their
disobedience, will disobey the laws [[law]], and thereby overthrow the
common-wealth, and introduce confusion, and civill [[war]]; for the avoiding
whereof, all civill [[government]] was ordained. and therefore in all
common-wealths of the heathen, the soveraigns have had the name of
pastors of the [[people]], because there was no [[subject]] that could lawfully
teach the [[people]], but by their permission and [[authority]].

this [[right]] of the heathen kings [[king]], cannot bee [[thought]] taken from them by
their conversion to the [[faith]] of [[christ]]; who never ordained, that kings
for beleeving in him, should be deposed, that is, subjected to any but
himself, or (which is all one) be deprived of the [[power]] necessary for
the conservation of [[peace]] amongst their subjects [[subject]], and for their defence
against foraign enemies [[enemy]]. and therefore [[christian]] kings [[king]] are still the
supreme [[pastors]] of their [[people]], and have [[power]] to ordain what pastors
they please, to [[teach]] the [[church]], that is, to [[teach]] the [[people]] committed
to their charge.

again, let the [[right]] of choosing them be (as before the conversion
of kings) in the [[church]], for so it was in the [[time]] of the apostles
themselves (as hath been shewn already in this chapter); even so also
the [[right]] will be in the civill soveraign, [[christian]]. for in that he is
a [[christian]], he allowes the teaching; and in that he is the soveraign
(which is as much as to say, the [[church]] by representation,) the
teachers hee elects, are elected by the [[church]]. and when an assembly of
christians choose their pastor in a [[christian]] common-wealth, it is the
soveraign that electeth him, because tis done by his [[authority]]; in the
same manner, as when a town choose their maior, it is the act of him
that hath the soveraign [[power]]: for every act done, is the act of him,
without whose [[consent]] it is invalid. and therefore whatsoever examples
may be drawn out of [[history]], concerning the election of [[pastors]], by the
people, or by the clergy, they are no arguments against the [[right]] of
any civill soveraign, because they that elected them did it by his
authority.

seeing then in every [[christian]] common-wealth, the civill soveraign is
the supreme pastor, to whose charge the whole flock of his subjects [[subject]] is
committed, and consequently that it is by his [[authority]], that all
other [[pastors]] are made, and have [[power]] to [[teach]], and performe all
other pastorall offices; it followeth also, that it is from the civill
soveraign, that all other [[pastors]] derive their [[right]] of teaching,
preaching, and other functions pertaining to that office; and that they
are but his ministers; in the same manner as the magistrates of towns,
judges in courts of [[justice]], and commanders of armies [[army]], are all but
ministers of him that is the magistrate of the whole common-wealth,
judge of all causes, and commander of the whole militia, which is
alwayes the civill soveraign. and the [[reason]] hereof, is not because they
that [[teach]], but because they that are to learn, are his subjects [[subject]].
for let it be supposed, that a [[christian]] [[king]] commit the [[authority]] of
ordaining [[pastors]] in his dominions to another [[king]], (as divers christian
kings allow that [[power]] to the [[pope]];) he doth not thereby constitute a
pastor over himself, nor a soveraign pastor over his [[people]]; for that
were to deprive himself of the civill [[power]]; which depending on the
opinion [[men]] have of their [[duty]] to him, and the [[fear]] they have of
punishment in another [[world]], would depend also on the [[skill]], and loyalty
of doctors, who are no lesse [[subject]], not only to [[ambition]], but also
to ignorance, than any other sort of [[men]]. so that where a stranger hath
authority to appoint teachers, it is given him by the soveraign in
whose dominions he teacheth. [[christian]] doctors are our schoolmasters
to [[christianity]]; but kings [[king]] are fathers [[father]] of families [[family]], and may receive
schoolmasters for their subjects [[subject]] from the recommendation of a stranger,
but not from the command; especially when the ill teaching them shall
redound to the [[great]] and manifest [[profit]] of him that recommends them:
nor can they be obliged to retain them, longer than it is for the
publique [[good]]; the [[care]] of which they stand so long charged withall, as
they retain any other essentiall [[right]] of the soveraignty.




the pastorall [[authority]] of soveraigns only is de jure divino, that of
other [[pastors]] is jure civili

if a [[man]] therefore should ask a pastor, in the execution of his office,
as the [[chief]] priests [[priest]] and elders of the [[people]] (mat. 21.23.) [[asked]] our
saviour, "by what [[authority]] dost thou these things, and who gave thee
this [[authority]]:" he can make no other just [[answer]], but that he doth
it by the [[authority]] of the common-wealth, given him by the [[king]], or
assembly that representeth it. all [[pastors]], except the supreme, execute
their charges in the [[right]], that is by the [[authority]] of the civill
soveraign, that is, jure civili. but the [[king]], and every other soveraign
executeth his office of supreme pastor, by immediate [[authority]] from [[god]],
that is to say, in gods [[right]], or jure divino. and therefore none but
kings can put into their titles (a mark of their submission to [[god]] onely
) dei gratia rex, &c. bishops ought to say in the beginning of their
mandates, "by the favour of the kings [[king]] majesty, bishop of such a
diocesse;" or as civill ministers, "in his majesties name." for in
saying, divina providentia, which is the same with dei gratia, though
disguised, they deny to have received their [[authority]] from the civill
state; and sliely slip off the collar of their civill subjection,
contrary to the unity and defence of the common-wealth.




christian kings [[king]] have [[power]] to execute all manner of pastoral function

but if every [[christian]] soveraign be the supreme pastor of his own
subjects, it seemeth that he hath also the [[authority]], not only to preach
(which perhaps no [[man]] will deny;) but also to baptize, and to administer
the sacrament of the lords [[lord]] supper; and to consecrate both temples, and
pastors to gods service; which most [[men]] deny; partly because they use
not to do it; and partly because the administration of sacraments,
and consecration of persons [[person]], and places to holy uses, requireth the
imposition of such mens [[men]] hands, as by the like imposition successively
from the [[time]] of the [[apostles]] have been ordained to the like ministery.
for proof therefore that [[christian]] kings [[king]] have [[power]] to baptize, and to
consecrate, i am to render a [[reason]], both why they use not to doe it,
and how, without the ordinary [[ceremony]] of imposition of hands, they are
made capable of doing it, when they will.

there is no [[doubt]] but any [[king]], in case he were skilfull in the
sciences, might by the same [[right]] of his office, [[read]] lectures of
them himself, by which he authorizeth others to [[read]] them in the
universities. neverthelesse, because the [[care]] of the summe of the
businesse of the common-wealth taketh up his whole [[time]], it were not
convenient for him to apply himself in [[person]] to that particular. a king
may also if he please, sit in [[judgment]], to hear and determine all manner
of causes, as well as give others [[authority]] to doe it in his name; but
that the charge that lyeth upon him of command and [[government]], constrain
him to bee continually at the helm, and to commit the ministeriall
offices to others under him. in the like manner our saviour (who surely
had [[power]] to baptize) baptized none himselfe, but sent his [[apostles]] and
disciples to baptize. (john 4.2.) so also s. paul, by the necessity of
preaching in divers and far distant places, baptized few: amongst all
the corinthians he baptized only crispus, cajus, and stephanus; (1
cor.1.14,16.) and the [[reason]] was, because his principall charge was to
preach. (1 cor. 1.17.) whereby it is manifest, that the greater charge,
(such as is the [[government]] of the [[church]],) is a dispensation for the
lesse. the [[reason]] therefore why [[christian]] kings [[king]] use not to baptize, is
evident, and the same, for which at this day there are few baptized by
bishops, and by the [[pope]] fewer.

and as concerning imposition of hands, whether it be needfull, for the
authorizing of a [[king]] to baptize, and consecrate, we may consider thus.

imposition of hands, was a most ancient publique [[ceremony]] amongst the
jews, by which was designed, and made [[certain]], the [[person]], or other
thing intended in a mans [[man]] prayer, blessing, [[sacrifice]], consecration,
condemnation, or other [[speech]]. so jacob in blessing the [[children]] of
joseph (gen. 48.14.) "laid his [[right]] hand on ephraim the younger, and
his left hand on manasseh the first born;" and this he did wittingly
(though they were so presented to him by joseph, as he was forced in
doing it to stretch out his arms acrosse) to design to whom he intended
the greater blessing. so also in the sacrificing of the burnt offering,
aaron is commanded (exod. 29.10.) "to lay his hands on the head of the
bullock;" and (ver. 15.) "to lay his hand on the head of the ramme."
the same is also said again, levit. 1.4. & 8.14. likewise [[moses]] when he
ordained joshua to be captain of the israelites, that is, consecrated
him to gods service, (numb. 27.23.) "laid his hands upon him, and gave
him his charge," designing and rendring [[certain]], who it was they were
to obey in [[war]]. and in the consecration of the levites (numb. 8.10.) god
commanded that "the [[children]] of [[israel]] should put their hands upon the
levites." and in the condemnation of him that had blasphemed the lord
(levit. 24.14.) [[god]] commanded that "all that heard him should lay their
hands on his head, and that all the congregation should stone him." and
why should they only that heard him, lay their hands upon him, and not
rather a [[priest]], levite, or other minister of [[justice]], but that
none else were able to design, and demonstrate to the [[eyes]] of the
congregation, who it was that had blasphemed, and ought to [[die]]? and
to design a [[man]], or any other thing, by the hand to the eye is lesse
subject to mistake, than when it is done to the eare by a name.

and so much was this [[ceremony]] observed, that in blessing the whole
congregation at once, which cannot be done by laying on of hands, yet
"aaron (levit. 9.22.) did lift up his hand towards the [[people]] when he
blessed them." and we [[read]] also of the like [[ceremony]] of consecration of
temples amongst the heathen, as that the [[priest]] laid his hands on
some post of the temple, all the while he was uttering the words of
consecration. so naturall it is to design any individuall thing, rather
by the hand, to assure the [[eyes]], than by words to inform the eare in
matters of gods publique service.

this [[ceremony]] was not therefore new in our saviours [[time]]. for jairus
(mark 5.23.) whose [[daughter]] was sick, besought our saviour (not to heal
her, but) "to lay his hands upon her, that shee might bee healed." and
(matth. 19.13.) "they brought unto him little [[children]], that hee should
put his hands on them, and [[pray]]."

according to this ancient rite, the [[apostles]], and presbyters, and the
presbytery it [[self]], laid hands on them whom they ordained [[pastors]], and
withall prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost; and that
not only once, but sometimes oftner, when a new [[occasion]] was presented:
but the end was still the same, namely a punctuall, and religious
designation of the [[person]], ordained either to the pastorall charge
in general, or to a particular mission: so (act. 6.6.) "the apostles
prayed, and laid their hands" on the seven deacons; which was done,
not to give them the holy ghost, (for they were full of the holy ghost
before thy were chosen, as appeareth immediately before, verse 3.) but
to design them to that office. and after philip the deacon had converted
certain persons [[person]] in samaria, peter and john went down (act. 8.17.)" and
laid their hands on them, and they received the holy ghost." and not
only an apostle, but a presbyter had this [[power]]: for s. paul adviseth
timothy (1 tim. 5.22.) "lay hands suddenly on no [[man]];" that is, designe
no [[man]] rashly to the office of a pastor. the whole presbytery laid their
hands on timothy, as we [[read]] 1 tim. 4.14. but this is to be understood,
as that some did it by the appointment of the presbytery, and most
likely their proestos, or prolocutor, which it may be was st. paul
himself. for in his 2 epist. to tim. ver. 6. he saith to him, "stirre up
the gift of [[god]] which is in thee, by the laying on of my hands:" where
note by the way, that by the holy ghost, is not meant the third person
in the trinity, but the gifts necessary to the pastorall office. we read
also, that st. paul had imposition of hands twice; once from ananias at
damascus (acts 9.17,18.) at the [[time]] of his baptisme; and again (acts
13.3.) at antioch, when he was first sent out to preach. the use then of
this [[ceremony]] considered in the ordination of [[pastors]], was to design
the [[person]] to whom they gave such [[power]]. but if there had been then any
christian, that had had the [[power]] of teaching before; the baptizing of
him, that is the making of him a [[christian]], had given him no new [[power]],
but had onely caused him to preach true doctrine, that is, to use
his [[power]] aright; and therefore the imposition of hands had been
unnecessary; baptisme it selfe had been sufficient. but every soveraign,
before [[christianity]], had the [[power]] of teaching, and ordaining teachers;
and therefore [[christianity]] gave them no new [[right]], but only directed
them in the way of teaching [[truth]]; and consequently they needed
no imposition of hands (besides that which is done in baptisme) to
authorize them to exercise any part of the pastorall function, as
namely, to baptize, and consecrate. and in the old testament, though
the [[priest]] only had [[right]] to consecrate, during the [[time]] that the
soveraignty was in the high [[priest]]; yet it was not so when the
soveraignty was in the [[king]]: for we [[read]] (1 kings [[king]] 8.) that solomon
blessed the [[people]], consecrated the temple, and pronounced that publique
prayer, which is the pattern now for consecration of all christian
churches, and chappels: whereby it appears, he had not only the right
of ecclesiasticall [[government]]; but also of exercising ecclesiasticall
functions.




the civill soveraigne if a [[christian]], is head of the [[church]] in his own
dominions

from this consolidation of the [[right]] politique, and ecclesiastique in
christian soveraigns, it is evident, they have all manner of [[power]] over
their subjects [[subject]], that can be given to [[man]], for the [[government]] of mens
externall actions, both in policy, and [[religion]]; and may make such
laws, as themselves shall [[judge]] fittest, for the [[government]] of their
own subjects [[subject]], both as they are the common-wealth, and as they are the
church: for both [[state]], and [[church]] are the same [[men]].

if they please therefore, they may (as many [[christian]] kings [[king]] now doe)
commit the [[government]] of their subjects [[subject]] in matters of [[religion]] to
the [[pope]]; but then the [[pope]] is in that point subordinate to them, and
exerciseth that charge in anothers dominion jure civili, in the [[right]] of
the civill soveraign; not jure divino, in gods [[right]]; and may therefore
be discharged of that office, when the soveraign for the [[good]] of his
subjects shall [[think]] it necessary. they may also if they please,
commit the [[care]] of [[religion]] to one supreme pastor, or to an assembly of
pastors; and give them what [[power]] over the [[church]], or one over another,
they [[think]] most convenient; and what titles of [[honor]], as of bishops,
archbishops, priests [[priest]], or presbyters, they will; and make such laws [[law]] for
their maintenance, either by tithes, or otherwise, as they please,
so they doe it out of a sincere [[conscience]], of which [[god]] onely is
the [[judge]]. it is the civill soveraign, that is to appoint judges [[judge]], and
interpreters of the canonicall scriptures [[scripture]]; for it is he that maketh them
laws. it is he also that giveth [[strength]] to excommunications; which but
for such laws [[law]] and punishments [[punishment]], as may humble obstinate libertines, and
reduce them to union with the rest of the [[church]], would bee
contemned. in summe, he hath the supreme [[power]] in all causes, as well
ecclesiasticall, as civill, as far as concerneth actions, and words, for
these onely are known, and may be accused; and of that which cannot be
accused, there is no judg at all, but [[god]], that knoweth the [[heart]].
and these rights [[right]] are incident to all soveraigns, whether monarchs, or
assemblies: for they that are the representants of a [[christian]] [[people]],
are representants of the [[church]]: for a [[church]], and a common-wealth of
christian [[people]], are the same thing.




cardinal bellarmines books [[book]] de summo pontifice considered

though this that i have here said, and in other places of this [[book]],
seem cleer enough for the asserting of the supreme ecclesiasticall power
to [[christian]] soveraigns; yet because the [[pope]] of romes challenge to that
power universally, hath been maintained chiefly, and i [[think]] as strongly
as is possible, by cardinall bellarmine, in his controversie de summo
pontifice; i have [[thought]] it necessary, as briefly as i can, to examine
the grounds, and [[strength]] of his discourse.




the first book

of five books [[book]] he hath written of this [[subject]], the first containeth
three questions [[question]]: one, which is simply the [[best]] [[government]], [[monarchy]],
aristocracy, or [[democracy]]; and concludeth for neither, but for a
government mixt of all there: another, which of these is the best
government of the [[church]]; and concludeth for the mixt, but which should
most participate of [[monarchy]]: the third, whether in this mixt [[monarchy]],
st. peter had the place of monarch. concerning his first conclusion, i
have already sufficiently proved (chapt. 18.) that all governments [[government]] which
men are bound to obey, are simple, and absolute. in [[monarchy]] there is
but one [[man]] supreme; and all other [[men]] that have any [[kind]] of [[power]] in
the [[state]], have it by his commission, during his [[pleasure]]; and execute
it in his name: and in [[aristocracy]], and [[democracy]], but one supreme
assembly, with the same [[power]] that in [[monarchy]] belongeth to the monarch,
which is not a mixt, but an absolute soveraignty. and of the three
sorts, which is the [[best]], is not to be disputed, where any one of them
is already established; but the [[present]] ought alwaies to be preferred,
maintained, and accounted [[best]]; because it is against both the [[law]] of
nature, and the [[divine]] positive [[law]], to doe any thing tending to the
subversion thereof. besides, it maketh nothing to the [[power]] of
any pastor, (unlesse he have the civill soveraignty,) what [[kind]] of
government is the [[best]]; because their calling is not to govern [[men]] by
commandement, but to [[teach]] them, and perswade them by arguments, and
leave it to them to consider, whether they shall embrace, or reject the
doctrine taught. for [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], and [[democracy]], do mark out
unto us three sorts of soveraigns, not of [[pastors]]; or, as we may say,
three sorts of masters of families [[family]], not three sorts of schoolmasters for
their [[children]].

and therefore the second conclusion, concerning the [[best]] form of
government of the [[church]], is nothing to the [[question]] of the popes power
without his own dominions: for in all other common-wealths his [[power]] (if
hee have any at all) is that of the schoolmaster onely, and not of the
master of the [[family]].

for the third conclusion, which is, that st. peter was monarch of the
church, he bringeth for his chiefe argument the place of s. matth.
(chap. 16.18, 19.) "thou art [[arts]] peter, and upon this rock i will build my
church, &c. and i will give thee the keyes of [[heaven]]; whatsoever thou
shalt bind on [[earth]], shall be bound in [[heaven]], and whatsoever thou shalt
loose on [[earth]], shall be loosed in [[heaven]]." which place well considered,
proveth no more, but that the [[church]] of [[christ]] hath for foundation one
onely article; namely, that which peter in the name of all the apostles
professing, gave [[occasion]] to our saviour to speak the words here cited;
which that wee may cleerly [[understand]], we are to consider, that our
saviour preached by himself, by john baptist, and by his [[apostles]],
nothing but this article of [[faith]], "that he was the [[christ]];" all other
articles requiring [[faith]] no otherwise, than as founded on that. john
began first, (mat. 3.2.) preaching only this, "the kingdome of [[god]] is at
hand." then our saviour himself (mat. 4.17.) preached the same: and to
his twelve [[apostles]], when he gave them their commission (mat. 10.7.)
there is no mention of preaching any other article but that. this was
the fundamentall article, that is the foundation of the churches [[church]] [[faith]].
afterwards the [[apostles]] being returned to him, he asketh them all, (mat.
16.13) not peter onely, "who [[men]] said he was;" and they answered, that
"some said he was john the baptist, some elias, and others jeremias,
or one of the prophets [[prophet]]:" then (ver. 15.) he [[asked]] them all again, (not
peter onely) "whom say yee that i am?" therefore peter answered (for
them all) "thou art [[arts]] [[christ]], the [[son]] of the living [[god]];" which i said is
the foundation of the [[faith]] of the whole [[church]]; from which our saviour
takes the [[occasion]] of saying, "upon this stone i will build my [[church]];"
by which it is manifest, that by the foundation-stone of the [[church]], was
meant the fundamentall article of the churches [[church]] [[faith]]. but why then (will
some object) doth our saviour interpose these words, "thou art [[arts]] peter"?
if the originall of this text had been rigidly translated, the reason
would easily have appeared: we are therefore to consider, that the
apostle simon, was surnamed stone, (which is the signification of
the syriacke word cephas, and of the [[greek]] word petrus). our saviour
therefore after the [[confession]] of that fundamentall article, alluding
to his name, said (as if it were in english) thus, thou art [[arts]] "stone," and
upon this stone i will build my [[church]]: which is as much as to say, this
article, that "i am the [[christ]]," is the foundation of all the [[faith]] i
require in those that are to bee members of my [[church]]: neither is this
allusion to a name, an unusuall thing in [[common]] [[speech]]: but it had been
a [[strange]], and obscure [[speech]], if our saviour intending to build his
church on the [[person]] of st. peter, had said, "thou art [[arts]] a stone, and
upon this stone i will build my [[church]]," when it was so obvious without
ambiguity to have said, "i will build my [[church]] on thee; and yet there
had been still the same allusion to his name.

and for the following words, "i will give thee the keyes of [[heaven]], &c."
it is no more than what our saviour gave also to all the rest of his
disciples (matth. 18.18.) "whatsoever yee shall bind on [[earth]], shall be
bound in [[heaven]]. and whatsoever ye shall loose on [[earth]], shall be loosed
in [[heaven]]." but howsoever this be interpreted, there is no [[doubt]] but
the [[power]] here granted belongs to all supreme [[pastors]]; such as are all
christian civill soveraignes in their own dominions. in so much, as if
st. peter, or our saviour himself had converted any of them to beleeve
him, and to acknowledge his kingdome; yet because his kingdome is not of
this [[world]], he had left the supreme [[care]] of converting his subjects [[subject]] to
none but him; or else hee must have deprived him of the soveraignty,
to which the [[right]] of teaching is inseparably annexed. and thus much in
refutation of his first [[book]], wherein hee would prove st. peter to have
been the monarch universall of the [[church]], that is to say, of all the
christians in the [[world]].




the second book

the second [[book]] hath two conclusions: one, that s. peter was bishop
of [[rome]], and there dyed: the other, that the popes of [[rome]] are his
successors. both which have been disputed by others. but supposing them
to be true; yet if by bishop of [[rome]] bee understood either the
monarch of the [[church]], or the supreme pastor of it; not silvester, but
constantine (who was the first [[christian]] emperour) was that bishop; and
as constantine, so all other [[christian]] emperors [[emperor]] were of [[right]] supreme
bishops of the roman [[empire]]; i say of the roman [[empire]], not of all
christendome: for other [[christian]] soveraigns had the same [[right]] in their
severall territories, as to an office essentially adhaerent to their
soveraignty. which shall serve for [[answer]] to his second [[book]].




the third book

in the third [[book]], he handleth the [[question]] whether the [[pope]] be
antichrist. for my part, i see no argument that proves he is so, in that
sense that [[scripture]] useth the name: nor will i take any argument from
the quality of antichrist, to contradict the [[authority]] he exerciseth,
or hath heretofore exercised in the dominions of any other [[prince]], or
state.

it is evident that the prophets [[prophet]] of the old testament foretold, and the
jews expected a messiah, that is, a [[christ]], that should re-establish
amongst them the [[kingdom]] of [[god]], which had been rejected by them in
the [[time]] of samuel, when they required a [[king]] after the manner of
other nations. this expectation of theirs, made them obnoxious to the
imposture of all such, as had both the [[ambition]] to attempt the attaining
of the kingdome, and the art [[arts]] to [[deceive]] the [[people]] by counterfeit
miracles, by hypocriticall [[life]], or by orations and doctrine plausible.
our saviour therefore, and his [[apostles]] forewarned [[men]] of false
prophets, and of false christs. false christs, are such as pretend to
be the [[christ]], but are not, and are called properly antichrists, in such
sense, as when there happeneth a schisme in the [[church]] by the election
of two popes, the one calleth the other antipapa, or the false [[pope]].
and therefore antichrist in the proper signification hath two essentiall
marks; one, that he denyeth [[jesus]] to be [[christ]]; and another that he
professeth himselfe to bee [[christ]]. the first mark is set down by s. john
in his 1 epist. 4. ch. 3. ver. "every spirit that confesseth not that
jesus [[christ]] is come in the flesh, is not of [[god]]; and this is the spirit
of antichrist." the other mark is expressed in the words of our saviour,
(mat. 24.5.) "many shall come in my name, saying, i am [[christ]];" and
again, "if any [[man]] shall say unto you, loe, here is [[christ]], there is
christ beleeve it not." and therefore antichrist must be a false [[christ]],
that is, some one of them that shall pretend themselves to be [[christ]].
and out of these two marks, "to deny [[jesus]] to be the [[christ]]," and to
"affirm himselfe to be the [[christ]]," it followeth, that he must also be
an "adversary of the true [[christ]]," which is another usuall signification
of the word antichrist. but of these many antichrists, there is one
speciall one, o antichristos, the antichrist, or antichrist definitely,
as one certaine [[person]]; not indefinitely an antichrist. now seeing the
pope of [[rome]], neither pretendeth himself, nor denyeth [[jesus]] to be the
christ, i perceive not how he can be called antichrist; by which word
is not meant, one that falsely pretendeth to be his lieutenant, or vicar
generall, but to be hee. there is also some mark of the [[time]] of this
speciall antichrist, as (mat. 24.15.) when that abominable destroyer,
spoken of by daniel, (dan. 9. 27.) shall stand in the holy place, and
such tribulation as was not since the beginning of the [[world]], nor ever
shall be again, insomuch as if it were to [[last]] long, (ver. 22.) "no
flesh could be saved; but for the elects sake those days shall be
shortened" (made fewer). but that tribulation is not yet come; for it
is to be followed immediately (ver. 29.) by a darkening of the sun
and moon, a falling of the stars, a concussion of the heavens [[heaven]], and the
glorious coming again of our saviour, in the cloudes. and therefore the
antichrist is not yet come; whereas, many popes are both come and gone.
it is true, the [[pope]] in taking upon him to give laws [[law]] to all christian
kings, and nations, usurpeth a kingdome in this [[world]], which [[christ]] took
not on him: but he doth it not as [[christ]], but as for [[christ]], wherein
there is nothing of the antichrist.




the fourth book

in the fourth [[book]], to prove the [[pope]] to be the supreme judg in all
questions of [[faith]] and manners, (which is as much as to be the absolute
monarch of all christians [[christian]] in the [[world]],) be bringeth three propositions:
the first, that his judgments [[judgment]] are infallible: the second, that he can
make very laws [[law]], and punish those that observe them not: the third, that
our saviour conferred all jurisdiction ecclesiasticall on the [[pope]] of
rome.




texts for the infallibility of the popes judgement in points of faith

for the infallibility of his judgments [[judgment]], he alledgeth the scriptures [[scripture]]: and
first, that of luke 22.31. "simon, simon, [[satan]] hath [[desired]] you that
hee may sift you as wheat; but i have prayed for thee, that thy faith
faile not; and when thou art [[arts]] converted, strengthen thy brethren [[brother]]." this,
according to bellarmines exposition, is, that [[christ]] gave here to simon
peter two priviledges: one, that neither his [[faith]] should fail, neither
he, nor any of his successors should ever define any point concerning
faith, or manners erroneously, or contrary to the definition of a former
pope: which is a [[strange]], and very much strained interpretation. but he
that with attention readeth that [[chapter]], shall find there is no place
in the whole [[scripture]], that maketh more against the popes [[authority]],
than this very place. the priests [[priest]] and scribes seeking to kill our
saviour at the passeover, and judas possessed with a resolution to
betray him, and the day of killing the passeover being come, our saviour
celebrated the same with his [[apostles]], which he said, till the kingdome
of [[god]] was come hee would doe no more; and withall told them, that one
of them was to betray him: hereupon they questioned, which of them it
should be; and withall (seeing the next passeover their master would
celebrate should be when he was king) entred into a contention, who
should then be the greater [[man]]. our saviour therefore told them, that
the kings [[king]] of the nations had dominion over their subjects [[subject]], and are
called by a name (in hebrew) that signifies bountifull; but i cannot
be so to you, you must endeavour to serve one another; i ordain you a
kingdome, but it is such as my [[father]] hath ordained mee; a kingdome that
i am now to purchase with my [[blood]], and not to possesse till my second
coming; then yee shall [[eat]] and drink at my table, and sit on thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of [[israel]]: and then addressing himself to
st. peter, he saith, simon, simon, [[satan]] seeks by suggesting a present
domination, to weaken your [[faith]] of the future; but i have prayed for
thee, that thy [[faith]] shall not fail; thou therefore (note this,) being
converted, and understanding my kingdome as of another [[world]], confirm
the same [[faith]] in thy brethren [[brother]]: to which s. peter answered (as one that
no more expected any [[authority]] in this world) "lord i am ready to goe
with thee, not onely to prison, but to [[death]]." whereby it is manifest,
s. peter had not onely no jurisdiction given him in this [[world]], but a
charge to [[teach]] all the other [[apostles]], that they also should have none.
and for the infallibility of st. peters sentence definitive in matter
of [[faith]], there is no more to be attributed to it out of this text, than
that peter should continue in the beleef of this point, namely, that
christ should come again, and possesse the kingdome at the day of
judgement; which was not given by the text to all his successors; for
wee see they claim it in the [[world]] that now is.

the second place is that of matth. 16. "thou art [[arts]] peter, and upon this
rocke i will build my [[church]], and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it." by which (as i have already shewn in this chapter) is
proved no more, than that the gates of hell shall not prevail against
the [[confession]] of peter, which gave [[occasion]] to that [[speech]]; namely
this, that [[jesus]] is [[christ]] the sonne of [[god]].

the third text is john 21. ver. 16,17. "feed my sheep;" which contains
no more but a commission of teaching: and if we grant the rest of the
apostles to be contained in that name of sheep; then it is the supreme
power of teaching: but it was onely for the [[time]] that there were no
christian soveraigns already possessed of that [[supremacy]]. but i have
already proved, that [[christian]] soveraignes are in their owne dominions
the supreme [[pastors]], and instituted thereto, by vertue of their being
baptized, though without other imposition of hands. for such imposition
being a [[ceremony]] of designing the [[person]], is needlesse, when hee is
already designed to the [[power]] of teaching what doctrine he will, by his
institution to an absolute [[power]] over his subjects [[subject]]. for as i have proved
before, soveraigns are supreme teachers (in generall) by their office
and therefore oblige themselves (by their baptisme) to [[teach]] the
doctrine of [[christ]]: and when they suffer others to [[teach]] their [[people]],
they doe it at the perill of their own souls [[soul]]; for it is at the hands
of the heads of families [[family]] that [[god]] will require the account of the
instruction of his [[children]] and servants. it is of [[abraham]] himself,
not of a hireling, that [[god]] saith (gen. 18.19) "i [[know]] him that he will
command his [[children]], and his houshold after him, that they keep the way
of the [[lord]], and do [[justice]] and judgement.

the fourth place is that of exod. 28.30. "thou shalt put in the
breastplate of [[judgment]], the urim and the thummin:" which hee saith is
interpreted by the septuagint, delosin kai aletheian, that is, evidence
and [[truth]]: and thence concludeth, [[god]] had given evidence, and [[truth]],
(which is almost infallibility,) to the high [[priest]]. but be it evidence
and [[truth]] it selfe that was given; or be it but admonition to the priest
to endeavour to inform himself cleerly, and give [[judgment]] uprightly;
yet in that it was given to the high [[priest]], it was given to the civill
soveraign: for next under [[god]] was the high [[priest]] in the common-wealth
of [[israel]]; and is an argument for evidence and [[truth]], that is, for the
ecclesiasticall [[supremacy]] of civill soveraigns over their own subjects [[subject]],
against the pretended [[power]] of the [[pope]]. these are all the texts hee
bringeth for the infallibility of the judgement of the [[pope]], in point of
faith.




texts for the same in point of manners

for the infallibility of his [[judgment]] concerning manners, hee bringeth
one text, which is that of john 16.13. "when the spirit of [[truth]] is
come, hee will lead you into all truth" where (saith he) by all [[truth]],
is meant, at least, all [[truth]] necessary to salvation. but with this
mitigation, he attributeth no more infallibility to the [[pope]], than to
any [[man]] that professeth [[christianity]], and is not to be damned: for
if any [[man]] erre in any point, wherein not to erre is necessary to
salvation, it is impossible he should be saved; for that onely is
necessary to salvation, without which to be saved is impossible. what
points these are, i shall declare out of the [[scripture]] in the chapter
following. in this place i say no more, but that though it were granted,
the [[pope]] could not possibly [[teach]] any error at all, yet doth not this
entitle him to any jurisdiction in the dominions of another [[prince]],
unlesse we shall also say, a [[man]] is obliged in [[conscience]] to set on
work upon all occasions [[occasion]] the [[best]] workman, even then also when he hath
formerly promised his [[work]] to another.

besides the text, he argueth from [[reason]], thus, if the [[pope]] could erre
in necessaries, then [[christ]] hath not sufficiently provided for the
churches salvation; because he hath commanded her to [[follow]] the popes
directions. but this [[reason]] is invalid, unlesse he shew when, and where
christ commanded that, or took at all any notice of a [[pope]]: nay granting
whatsoever was given to s. peter was given to the [[pope]]; yet seeing there
is in the [[scripture]] no command to any [[man]] to obey st. peter, no [[man]] can
bee just, that obeyeth him, when his commands are contrary to those of
his lawfull soveraign.

lastly, it hath not been declared by the [[church]], nor by the pope
himselfe, that he is the civill soveraign of all the christians [[christian]] in the
world; and therefore all christians [[christian]] are not bound to acknowledge his
jurisdiction in point of manners. for the civill soveraignty, and
supreme judicature in controversies of manners, are the same thing: and
the makers of civill laws [[law]], are not onely declarers, but also makers
of the [[justice]], and [[injustice]] of actions; there being nothing in mens
manners that makes them righteous, or unrighteous, but their conformity
with the [[law]] of the soveraign. and therefore when the [[pope]] challengeth
supremacy in controversies of manners, hee teacheth [[men]] to disobey the
civill soveraign; which is an erroneous doctrine, contrary to the
many precepts of our saviour and his [[apostles]], delivered to us in the
scripture.

to prove the [[pope]] has [[power]] to make laws [[law]], he alledgeth many places; as
first, deut. 17.12. "the [[man]] that will doe presumptuously, and will not
hearken unto the [[priest]], (that standeth to minister there before the
lord thy [[god]], or unto the [[judge]],) even that [[man]] shall [[die]], and thou
shalt put away the evill from [[israel]]." for [[answer]] whereunto, we are to
remember that the high [[priest]] (next and immediately under god) was the
civill soveraign; and all judges [[judge]] were to be constituted by him. the
words alledged sound therefore thus. "the [[man]] that will presume to
disobey the civill soveraign for the [[time]] being, or any of his officers
in the execution of their places, that [[man]] shall [[die]], &c." which is
cleerly for the civill soveraignty, against the universall [[power]] of the
pope.

secondly, he alledgeth that of matth. 16. "whatsoever yee shall bind,
&c." and interpreteth it for such binding as is attributed (matth.
23.4.) to the scribes and pharisees, "they bind heavy burthens, and
grievous to be born, and lay them on mens [[men]] shoulders;" by which is meant
(he sayes) making of laws [[law]]; and concludes thence, the [[pope]] can make
laws. but this also maketh onely for the legislative [[power]] of civill
soveraigns: for the scribes, and pharisees sat in [[moses]] chaire,
but [[moses]] next under [[god]] was soveraign of the [[people]] of [[israel]]: and
therefore our saviour commanded them to doe all that they should say,
but not all that they should do. that is, to obey their laws [[law]], but not
follow their [[example]].

the third place, is john 21.16. "feed my sheep;" which is not a power
to make laws [[law]], but a command to [[teach]]. making laws [[law]] belongs to the [[lord]] of
the [[family]]; who by his owne discretion chooseth his chaplain, as also a
schoolmaster to [[teach]] his [[children]].

the fourth place john 20.21. is against him. the words are, "as my
father sent me, so send i you." but our saviour was sent to redeem (by
his death) such as should beleeve; and by his own, and his apostles
preaching to prepare them for their entrance into his kingdome; which he
himself saith, is not of this [[world]], and hath taught us to [[pray]] for the
coming of it hereafter, though hee refused (acts 1.6,7.) to tell his
apostles when it should come; and in which, when it comes, the twelve
apostles shall sit on twelve thrones (every one perhaps as high as that
of st. peter) to [[judge]] the twelve tribes of [[israel]]. seeing then [[god]] the
father sent not our saviour to make laws [[law]] in this [[present]] [[world]], wee may
conclude from the text, that neither did our saviour send s. peter to
make laws [[law]] here, but to perswade [[men]] to expect his second comming with
a stedfast [[faith]]; and in the mean [[time]], if subjects [[subject]], to obey their
princes; and if princes [[prince]], both to beleeve it themselves, and to do their
best to make their subjects [[subject]] doe the same; which is the office of a
bishop. therefore this place maketh most strongly for the joining of the
ecclesiasticall [[supremacy]] to the civill soveraignty, contrary to that
which cardinall bellarmine alledgeth it for.

the fift place is acts 15.28. "it hath seemed [[good]] to the holy spirit,
and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden, than these necessary
things, that yee abstaine from meats offered to idols, and from bloud,
and from things strangled, and from fornication." here hee notes the
word laying of burdens for the legislative [[power]]. but who is there,
that reading this text, can say, this stile of the [[apostles]] may not as
properly be used in giving counsell, as in making laws [[law]]? the stile of a
law is, we command: but, we [[think]] [[good]], is the ordinary stile of them,
that but give [[advice]]; and they lay a burthen that give [[advice]], though
it bee conditionall, that is, if they to whom they give it, will
attain their ends: and such is the burthen, of abstaining from things
strangled, and from bloud; not absolute, but in case they will not
erre. i have shewn before (chap. 25.) that [[law]], is distinguished from
counsell, in this, that the [[reason]] of a [[law]], is taken from the designe,
and benefit of him that prescribeth it; but the [[reason]] of a counsell,
from the designe, and benefit of him, to whom the counsell is given. but
here, the [[apostles]] aime onely at the benefit of the converted gentiles,
namely their salvation; not at their own benefit; for having done their
endeavour, they shall have their [[reward]], whether they be obeyed, or not.
and therefore the acts of this councell, were not laws [[law]], but counsells.

the sixt place is that of rom. 13. "let every [[soul]] be [[subject]] to the
higher powers [[power]], for there is no [[power]] but of [[god]];" which is meant, he
saith not onely of secular, but also of ecclesiasticall princes [[prince]]. to
which i [[answer]], first, that there are no ecclesiasticall princes [[prince]] but
those that are also civill soveraignes; and their principalities exceed
not the compasse of their civill soveraignty; without those bounds
though they may be received for doctors, they cannot be acknowledged for
princes. for if the apostle had meant, we should be [[subject]] both to our
own princes [[prince]], and also to the [[pope]], he had taught us a doctrine, which
christ himself hath told us is impossible, namely, "to serve two
masters." and though the apostle say in another place, "i write these
things being absent, lest being [[present]] i should use sharpnesse,
according to the [[power]] which the [[lord]] hath given me;" it is not, that
he challenged a [[power]] either to put to [[death]], imprison, banish, whip,
or fine any of them, which are punishments [[punishment]]; but onely to excommunicate,
which (without the civill power) is no more but a leaving of their
company, and having no more to doe with them, than with a heathen [[man]],
or a publican; which in many occasions [[occasion]] might be a greater [[pain]] to the
excommunicant, than to the excommunicate.

the seventh place is 1 cor. 4.21. "shall i come unto you with a rod, or
in [[love]], and the spirit of lenity?" but here again, it is not the power
of a magistrate to punish offenders, that is meant by a rod; but
onely the [[power]] of excommunication, which is not in its owne nature
a [[punishment]], but onely a denouncing of [[punishment]], that [[christ]] shall
inflict, when he shall be in possession of his kingdome, at the day of
judgment. nor then also shall it bee properly a [[punishment]], as upon a
subject that hath broken the [[law]]; but a [[revenge]], as upon an [[enemy]], or
revolter, that denyeth the [[right]] of our saviour to the kingdome: and
therefore this proveth not the legislative [[power]] of any bishop, that has
not also the civill [[power]].

the eighth place is, timothy 3.2. "a bishop must be the husband but of
one [[wife]], vigilant, sober, &c." which he saith was a [[law]]. i [[thought]] that
none could make a [[law]] in the [[church]], but the monarch of the [[church]], st.
peter. but suppose this precept made by the [[authority]] of st. peter;
yet i see no [[reason]] why to call it a [[law]], rather than an [[advice]], seeing
timothy was not a [[subject]], but a disciple of st. paul; nor the flock
under the charge of timothy, his subjects [[subject]] in the kingdome, but his
scholars in the schoole of [[christ]]: if all the precepts he giveth
timothy, be laws [[law]], why is not this also a [[law]], "drink no longer water,
but use a little wine for thy healths sake"? and why are not also
the precepts of [[good]] physitians, so many laws [[law]]? but that it is not the
imperative manner of speaking, but an absolute subjection to a [[person]],
that maketh his precept laws [[law]].

in like manner, the ninth place, 1 tim. 5. 19. "against an elder
receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses," is a wise
precept, but not a [[law]].

the tenth place is, luke 10.16. "he that heareth you, heareth mee; and
he that despiseth you, despiseth me." and there is no [[doubt]], but he that
despiseth the counsell of those that are sent by [[christ]], despiseth
the counsell of [[christ]] himself. but who are those now that are sent by
christ, but such as are ordained [[pastors]] by lawfull [[authority]]? and who
are lawfully ordained, that are not ordained by the soveraign
pastor? and who is ordained by the soveraign pastor in a christian
common-wealth, that is not ordained by the [[authority]] of the soveraign
thereof? out of this place therefore it followeth, that he which heareth
his soveraign being a [[christian]], heareth [[christ]]; and hee that despiseth
the doctrine which his [[king]] being a [[christian]], authorizeth, despiseth
the doctrine of [[christ]] (which is not that which bellarmine intendeth
here to prove, but the contrary). but all this is nothing to a [[law]]. nay
more, a [[christian]] [[king]], as a pastor, and teacher of his subjects [[subject]], makes
not thereby his doctrines laws [[law]]. he cannot oblige [[men]] to beleeve; though
as a civill soveraign he may make laws [[law]] suitable to his doctrine, which
may oblige [[men]] to [[certain]] actions, and sometimes to such as they would
not otherwise do, and which he ought not to command; and yet when
they are commanded, they are laws [[law]]; and the externall actions done in
obedience to them, without the inward approbation, are the actions of
the soveraign, and not of the [[subject]], which is in that case but as
an instrument, without any motion of his owne at all; because [[god]] hath
commanded to obey them.

the eleventh, is every place, where the apostle for counsell, putteth
some word, by which [[men]] use to signifie command; or calleth the
following of his counsell, by the name of [[obedience]]. and therefore they
are alledged out of 1 cor. 11.2. "i commend you for keeping my precepts
as i delivered them to you." the [[greek]] is, "i commend you for keeping
those things i delivered to you, as i delivered them." which is far from
signifying that they were laws [[law]], or any thing else, but [[good]] counsell.
and that of 1 thess. 4.2. "you [[know]] what commandements we gave you:"
where the [[greek]] word is paraggelias edokamen, equivalent to paredokamen,
what wee delivered to you, as in the place next before alledged, which
does not prove the traditions of the [[apostles]], to be any more than
counsells; though as is said in the 8th verse, "he that despiseth them,
despiseth not [[man]], but god": for our saviour himself came not to [[judge]],
that is, to be [[king]] in this [[world]]; but to [[sacrifice]] himself for sinners,
and leave doctors in his [[church]], to lead, not to drive [[men]] to [[christ]],
who never accepteth forced actions, (which is all the [[law]] produceth,)
but the inward conversion of the [[heart]]; which is not the [[work]] of laws [[law]],
but of counsell, and doctrine.

and that of 2 thess. 3.14. "if any [[man]] obey not our word by this
epistle, note that [[man]], and have no company with him, that he may bee
ashamed": where from the word obey, he would inferre, that this epistle
was a [[law]] to the thessalonians. the epistles of the emperours were
indeed laws [[law]]. if therefore the epistle of s. paul were also a [[law]], they
were to obey two masters. but the word obey, as it is in the greek
upakouei, signifieth hearkening to, or putting in practice, not onely
that which is commanded by him that has [[right]] to punish, but also that
which is delivered in a way of counsell for our [[good]]; and therefore st.
paul does not bid kill him that disobeys, nor beat, nor imprison, nor
amerce him, which legislators may all do; but avoid his company, that
he may bee ashamed: whereby it is evident, it was not the [[empire]] of an
apostle, but his [[reputation]] amongst the faithfull, which the christians
stood in awe of.

the [[last]] place is that of heb. 13.17. "obey your leaders, and submit
your selves to them, for they watch for your souls [[soul]], as they that must
give account:" and here also is intended by [[obedience]], a following of
their counsell: for the [[reason]] of our [[obedience]], is not drawn from the
will and command of our [[pastors]], but from our own benefit, as being the
salvation of our souls [[soul]] they watch for, and not for the exaltation of
their own [[power]], and [[authority]]. if it were meant here, that all they
teach were laws [[law]], then not onely the [[pope]], but every pastor in his parish
should have legislative [[power]]. again, they that are bound to obey, their
pastors, have no [[power]] to examine their commands. what then shall wee
say to st. john who bids us (1 epist. chap. 4. ver. 1.) "not to beleeve
every spirit, but to try the spirits whether they are of [[god]], because
many false prophets [[prophet]] are gone out into the world"? it is therefore
manifest, that wee may dispute the doctrine of our [[pastors]]; but no man
can dispute a [[law]]. the commands of civill soveraigns are on all sides
granted to be laws [[law]]: if any else can make a [[law]] besides himselfe, all
common-wealth, and consequently all [[peace]], and [[justice]] must cease; which
is contrary to all laws [[law]], both [[divine]] and humane. nothing therefore can
be drawn from these, or any other places of [[scripture]], to prove the
decrees of the [[pope]], where he has not also the civill soveraignty, to be
laws.

the [[question]] of superiority between the [[pope]] and other bishops the last
point hee would prove, is this, "that our saviour [[christ]] has committed
ecclesiasticall jurisdiction immediately to none but the [[pope]]." wherein
he handleth not the [[question]] of [[supremacy]] between the [[pope]] and christian
kings, but between the [[pope]] and other bishops. and first, he sayes it is
agreed, that the jurisdiction of bishops, is at least in the generall
de jure divino, that is, in the [[right]] of [[god]]; for which he alledges s.
paul, ephes. 4.11. where hee sayes, that [[christ]] after his ascension
into [[heaven]], "gave gifts to [[men]], some [[apostles]], some prophets [[prophet]], and some
evangelists, and some [[pastors]], and some teachers:" and thence inferres,
they have indeed their jurisdiction in gods [[right]]; but will not grant
they have it immediately from [[god]], but derived through the [[pope]]. but if
a [[man]] may be said to have his jurisdiction de jure divino, and yet not
immediately; what lawfull jurisdiction, though but civill, is there in a
christian common-wealth, that is not also de jure divino? for christian
kings have their civill [[power]] from [[god]] immediately; and the magistrates
under him exercise their severall charges in vertue of his commission;
wherein that which they doe, is no lesse de jure divino mediato, than
that which the bishops doe, in vertue of the popes ordination. all
lawfull [[power]] is of [[god]], immediately in the supreme governour, and
mediately in those that have [[authority]] under him: so that either hee
must grant every constable in the [[state]], to hold his office in the right
of [[god]]; or he must not hold that any bishop holds his so, besides the
pope himselfe.

but this whole dispute, whether [[christ]] left the jurisdiction to the pope
onely, or to other bishops also, if considered out of these places where
the [[pope]] has the civill soveraignty, is a contention de lana caprina:
for none of them (where they are not soveraigns) has any jurisdiction
at all. for jurisdiction is the [[power]] of hearing and determining causes
between [[man]] and [[man]]; and can belong to none, but him that hath the power
to prescribe the rules [[rule]] of [[right]] and [[wrong]]; that is, to make laws [[law]];
and with the [[sword]] of [[justice]] to compell [[men]] to obey his decisions,
pronounced either by himself, or by the judges [[judge]] he ordaineth thereunto;
which none can lawfully do, but the civill soveraign.

therefore when he alledgeth out of the 6 of luke, that our saviour
called his disciples together, and chose twelve of them which he named
apostles, he proveth that he elected them (all, except matthias, paul
and barnabas,) and gave them [[power]] and command to preach, but not
to [[judge]] of causes between [[man]] and [[man]]: for that is a [[power]] which
he refused to take upon himselfe, saying, "who made me a [[judge]], or a
divider, amongst you?" and in another place, "my kingdome is not of this
world." but hee that hath not the [[power]] to hear, and determine causes
between [[man]] and [[man]], cannot be said to have any jurisdiction at all. and
yet this hinders not, but that our saviour gave them [[power]] to preach and
baptize in all parts of the [[world]], supposing they were not by their own
lawfull soveraign forbidden: for to our own soveraigns [[christ]] himself,
and his [[apostles]] have in sundry places expressely commanded us in all
things to be [[obedient]].

the arguments by which he would prove, that bishops receive their
jurisdiction from the [[pope]] (seeing the [[pope]] in the dominions of other
princes hath no jurisdiction himself,) are all in [[vain]]. yet because they
prove, on the contrary, that all bishops receive jurisdiction when they
have it from their civill soveraigns, i will not omit the recitall of
them.

the first, is from numbers 11. where [[moses]] not being able alone to
undergoe the whole burthen of administring the affairs of the [[people]] of
israel, [[god]] commanded him to choose seventy elders, and took part of
the spirit of [[moses]], to put it upon those seventy elders: by which it is
understood, not that [[god]] weakened the spirit of [[moses]], for that had not
eased him at all; but that they had all of them their [[authority]] from
him; wherein he doth truly, and ingenuously interpret that place. but
seeing [[moses]] had the entire soveraignty in the common-wealth of the
jews, it is manifest, that it is thereby signified, that they had their
authority from the civill soveraign: and therefore that place proveth,
that bishops in every [[christian]] common-wealth have their [[authority]] from
the civill soveraign; and from the [[pope]] in his own territories only, and
not in the territories of any other [[state]].

the second argument, is from the [[nature]] of [[monarchy]]; wherein all
authority is in one [[man]], and in others by derivation from him: but the
government of the [[church]], he says, is monarchicall. this also makes for
christian monarchs. for they are really monarchs of their own [[people]];
that is, of their own [[church]] (for the [[church]] is the same thing with a
christian [[people]];) whereas the [[power]] of the [[pope]], though hee were
s. peter, is neither [[monarchy]], nor hath any thing of archicall, nor
craticall, but onely of didacticall; for [[god]] accepteth not a forced, but
a willing [[obedience]].

the third, is, from that the sea of s. peter is called by s. cyprian,
the head, the source, the roote, the sun, from whence the authority
of bishops is derived. but by the [[law]] of [[nature]] (which is a better
principle of [[right]] and [[wrong]], than the word of any doctor that is but
a man) the civill soveraign in every common-wealth, is the head, the
source, the root, and the sun, from which all jurisdiction is derived.
and therefore, the jurisdiction of bishops, is derived from the civill
soveraign.

the fourth, is taken from the inequality of their jurisdictions: for
if [[god]] (saith he) had given it them immediately, he had given aswell
equality of jurisdiction, as of order: but wee see, some are bishops but
of own town, some of a hundred towns, and some of many whole provinces;
which differences were not determined by the command of [[god]]; their
jurisdiction therefore is not of [[god]], but of [[man]]; and one has a
greater, another a lesse, as it pleaseth the [[prince]] of the [[church]]. which
argument, if he had proved before, that the [[pope]] had had an universall
jurisdiction over all christians [[christian]], had been for his [[purpose]]. but seeing
that hath not been proved, and that it is notoriously known, the large
jurisdiction of the [[pope]] was given him by those that had it, that is,
by the emperours of [[rome]], (for the patriarch of constantinople, upon the
same title, namely, of being bishop of the capitall [[city]] of the [[empire]],
and seat of the emperour, claimed to be [[equal]] to him,) it followeth,
that all other bishops have their jurisdiction from the soveraigns of
the place wherein they exercise the same: and as for that cause they
have not their [[authority]] de jure divino; so neither hath the [[pope]] his de
jure divino, except onely where hee is also the civill soveraign.

his fift argument is this, "if bishops have their jurisdiction
immediately from [[god]], the [[pope]] could not take it from them, for he can
doe nothing contrary to gods ordination;" and this consequence is [[good]],
and well proved. "but, (saith he) the [[pope]] can do this, and has done
it." this also is granted, so he doe it in his own dominions, or in the
dominions of any other [[prince]] that hath given him that [[power]]; but not
universally, in [[right]] of the popedome: for that [[power]] belongeth to
every [[christian]] soveraign, within the bounds of his owne [[empire]], and is
inseparable from the soveraignty. before the [[people]] of [[israel]] had (by
the commandment of [[god]] to samuel) set over themselves a [[king]], after the
manner of other nations, the high [[priest]] had the civill [[government]]; and
none but he could make, nor depose an inferiour [[priest]]: but that power
was afterwards in the [[king]], as may be proved by this same argument of
bellarmine; for if the [[priest]] (be he the high [[priest]] or any other) had
his jurisdiction immediately from [[god]], then the [[king]] could not take it
from him; "for he could do nothing contrary to gods ordinance: but it
is [[certain]], that [[king]] solomon (1 kings [[king]] 2.26.) deprived abiathar the high
priest of his office, and placed zadok (verse 35.) in his room. kings
therefore may in the like manner ordaine, and deprive bishops, as they
shall thinke fit, for the well governing of their subjects [[subject]].

his sixth argument is this, if bishops have their jurisdiction de jure
divino (that is, immediately from [[god]],) they that maintaine it, should
bring some word of [[god]] to prove it: but they can bring none. the
argument is [[good]]; i have therefore nothing to say against it. but it
is an argument no lesse [[good]], to prove the [[pope]] himself to have no
jurisdiction in the dominion of any other [[prince]].

lastly, hee bringeth for argument, the testimony of two popes, [[innocent]],
and leo; and i [[doubt]] not but hee might have alledged, with as good
reason, the testimonies of all the popes almost since s. peter: for
considering the [[love]] of [[power]] naturally implanted in [[mankind]], whosoever
were made [[pope]], he would be tempted to uphold the same [[opinion]].
neverthelesse, they should therein but doe, as [[innocent]], and leo did,
bear witnesse of themselves, and therefore their witness should not be
good.




of the popes temporall power

in the fift [[book]] he hath four conclusions. the first is, "that the pope
in not [[lord]] of all the [[world]]:" the second, "that the [[pope]] is not lord
of all the [[christian]] [[world]]:" the third, "that the [[pope]] (without his owne
territory) has not any temporall jurisdiction directly:" these three
conclusions are easily granted. the fourth is, "that the [[pope]] has (in
the dominions of other princes) the supreme temporall [[power]] indirectly:"
which is denyed; unlesse he mean by indirectly, that he has gotten it by
indirect means; then is that also granted. but i [[understand]], that
when he saith he hath it indirectly, he means, that such temporall
jurisdiction belongeth to him of [[right]], but that this [[right]] is but a
consequence of his pastorall [[authority]], the which he could not exercise,
unlesse he have the other with it: and therefore to the pastorall power
(which he calls spirituall) the supreme [[power]] civill is necessarily
annexed; and that thereby hee hath a [[right]] to [[change]] kingdomes, giving
them to one, and taking them from another, when he shall [[think]] it
conduces to the salvation of souls [[soul]].

before i come to consider the arguments by which hee would prove this
doctrine, it will not bee amisse to lay open the consequences of it;
that princes [[prince]], and states, that have the civill soveraignty in their
severall common-wealths, may bethink themselves, whether it bee
convenient for them, and conducing to the [[good]] of their subjects [[subject]], of
whom they are to give an account at the day of [[judgment]], to admit the
same.

when it is said, the [[pope]] hath not (in the territories of other states)
the supreme civill [[power]] directly; we are to [[understand]], he doth
not challenge it, as other civill soveraigns doe, from the originall
submission thereto of those that are to be governed. for it is evident,
and has already been sufficiently in this treatise demonstrated, that
the [[right]] of all soveraigns, is derived originally from the [[consent]] of
every one of those that are to bee governed; whether they that choose
him, doe it for their [[common]] defence against an [[enemy]], as when they
agree amongst themselves to appoint a [[man]], or an assembly of [[men]] to
protect them; or whether they doe it, to save their lives [[life]], by submission
to a conquering [[enemy]]. the [[pope]] therefore, when he disclaimeth the
supreme civill [[power]] over other states directly, denyeth no more, but
that his [[right]] cometh to him by that way; he ceaseth not for all that,
to claime it another way; and that is, (without the [[consent]] of them
that are to be governed) by a [[right]] given him by [[god]], (which hee calleth
indirectly,) in his assumption to the papacy. but by what way soever he
pretend, the [[power]] is the same; and he may (if it bee granted to be his
right) depose princes [[prince]] and states, as often as it is for the salvation
of soules, that is, as often as he will; for he claimeth also the sole
power to [[judge]], whether it be to the salvation of mens [[men]] souls [[soul]], or not.
and this is the doctrine, not onely that bellarmine here, and many other
doctors [[teach]] in their sermons and books [[book]], but also that some
councells have decreed, and the popes have decreed, and the popes have
accordingly, when the [[occasion]] hath served them, put in practise. for
the fourth councell of lateran held under [[pope]] [[innocent]] the third, (in
the third chap. de haereticis,) hath this canon. "if a [[king]] at the
popes admonition, doe not purge his kingdome of haeretiques, and being
excommunicate for the same, make not satisfaction within a year, his
subjects are absolved of their [[obedience]]." and the practise hereof hath
been seen on divers occasions [[occasion]]; as in the deposing of chilperique, king
of [[france]]; in the translation of the roman [[empire]] to charlemaine; in
the oppression of john [[king]] of [[england]]; in transferring the kingdome
of navarre; and of late years, in the league against henry the third of
france, and in many more occurrences. i [[think]] there be few princes [[prince]] that
consider not this as injust, and inconvenient; but i [[wish]] they would
all resolve to be kings [[king]], or subjects [[subject]]. [[men]] cannot serve two masters: they
ought therefore to ease them, either by holding the reins of government
wholly in their own hands; or by wholly delivering them into the
hands of the [[pope]]; that such [[men]] as are willing to be [[obedient]], may be
protected in their [[obedience]]. for this distinction of temporall, and
spirituall [[power]] is but words. [[power]] is as really divided, and as
dangerously to all purposes [[purpose]], by sharing with another indirect [[power]], as
with a direct one. but to come now to his arguments.

the first is this, "the civill [[power]] is [[subject]] to the spirituall:
therefore he that hath the supreme [[power]] spirituall, hath [[right]] to
command temporall princes [[prince]], and dispose of their temporalls in order to
the spirituall. as for the distinction of temporall, and spirituall,
let us consider in what sense it may be said intelligibly, that the
temporall, or civill [[power]] is [[subject]] to the spirituall. there be but
two ways that those words can be made sense. for when wee say, one power
is [[subject]] to another [[power]], the meaning either is, that he which hath
the one, is [[subject]] to him that hath the other; or that the one [[power]] is
to the other, as the means to the end. for wee cannot [[understand]], that
one [[power]] hath [[power]] over another [[power]]; and that one [[power]] can have
right or command over another: for subjection, command, [[right]], and
power are accidents, not of powers [[power]], but of persons [[person]]: one [[power]] may be
subordinate to another, as the art [[arts]] of a sadler, to the art [[arts]] of a rider.
if then it be granted, that the civill [[government]] be ordained as a means
to bring us to a spirituall felicity; yet it does not [[follow]], that if a
king have the civill [[power]], and the [[pope]] the spirituall, that therefore
the [[king]] is bound to obey the [[pope]], more then every sadler is bound to
obey every rider. therefore as from subordination of an art [[arts]], cannot be
inferred the subjection of the professor; so from the subordination of
a [[government]], cannot be inferred the subjection of the governor. when
therefore he saith, the civill [[power]] is [[subject]] to the spirituall, his
meaning is, that the civill soveraign, is [[subject]] to the spirituall
soveraign. and the argument stands thus, "the civil soveraign, is
subject to the spirituall; therefore the spirituall [[prince]] may
command temporall princes [[prince]]." where the conclusion is the same, with the
antecedent he should have proved. but to prove it, he alledgeth
first, this [[reason]], "kings and popes, clergy and laity make but one
common-wealth; that is to say, but one [[church]]: and in all bodies [[body]] the
members depend one upon another: but things spirituall depend not
of things temporall: therefore, temporall depend on spirituall. and
therefore are [[subject]] to them." in which argumentation there be two
grosse errours: one is, that all [[christian]] kings [[king]], popes, clergy, and all
other [[christian]] [[men]], make but one common-wealth: for it is evident that
france is one common-wealth, [[spain]] another, and venice a third, &c. and
these consist of christians [[christian]]; and therefore also are severall bodies
of christians [[christian]]; that is to say, severall churches [[church]]: and their severall
soveraigns represent them, whereby they are capable of commanding and
obeying, of doing and suffering, as a [[natural]] [[man]]; which no generall or
universall [[church]] is, till it have a representant; which it hath not on
earth: for if it had, there is no [[doubt]] but that all christendome were
one common-wealth, whose soveraign were that representant, both in
things spirituall and temporall: and the [[pope]], to make himself this
representant, wanteth three things that our saviour hath not given
him, to command, and to [[judge]], and to punish, otherwise than (by
excommunication) to run from those that will not learn of him: for
though the [[pope]] were christs onely vicar, yet he cannot exercise his
government, till our saviours second coming: and then also it is not the
pope, but st. peter himselfe, with the other [[apostles]], that are to be
judges of the [[world]].

the other errour in this his first argument is, that he sayes, the
members of every common-wealth, as of a naturall [[body]], depend one of
another: it is true, they cohaere together; but they depend onely on the
soveraign, which is the [[soul]] of the common-wealth; which failing, the
common-wealth is dissolved into a civill [[war]], no one [[man]] so much
as cohaering to another, for want of a [[common]] dependance on a known
soveraign; just as the members of the naturall [[body]] dissolve into [[earth]],
for want of a [[soul]] to hold them together. therefore there is nothing in
this similitude, from whence to inferre a dependance of the laity on the
clergy, or of the temporall officers on the spirituall; but of both on
the civill soveraign; which ought indeed to direct his civill commands
to the salvation of souls [[soul]]; but is not therefore [[subject]] to any but god
himselfe. and thus you see the laboured fallacy of the first argument,
to [[deceive]] such [[men]] as distinguish not between the subordination of
actions in the way to the end; and the subjection of persons [[person]] one to
another in the administration of the means. for to every end, the means
are determined by [[nature]], or by [[god]] himselfe supernaturally: but the
power to make [[men]] use the means, is in every nation resigned (by the
law of [[nature]], which forbiddeth [[men]] to violate their [[faith]] given) to the
civill soveraign.

his second argument is this, "every common-wealth, (because it is
supposed to be [[perfect]] and sufficient in it [[self]],) may command any
other common-wealth, not [[subject]] to it, and [[force]] it to [[change]] the
administration of the [[government]], nay depose the [[prince]], and set another
in his room, if it cannot otherwise defend it selfe against the injuries
he goes about to doe them: much more may a spirituall common-wealth
command a temporall one to [[change]] the administration of their
government, and may depose princes [[prince]], and institute others, when they
cannot otherwise defend the spirituall [[good]]."

that a common-wealth, to defend it selfe against injuries, may lawfully
doe all that he hath here said, is very true; and hath already in that
which hath gone before been sufficiently demonstrated. and if it were
also true, that there is now in this [[world]] a spirituall common-wealth,
distinct from a civill common-wealth, then might the [[prince]] thereof,
upon injury done him, or upon want of caution that injury be not done
him in [[time]] to come, repaire, and secure himself by warre; which is in
summe, deposing, killing, or subduing, or doing any act of hostility.
but by the same [[reason]], it would be no lesse lawfull for a civill
soveraign, upon the like injuries done, or feared, to make warre
upon the spirituall soveraign; which i beleeve is more than cardinall
bellarmine would have inferred from his own proposition.

but spirituall common-wealth there is none in this [[world]]: for it is the
same thing with the kingdome of [[christ]]; which he himselfe saith, is not
of this [[world]]; but shall be in the next [[world]], at the resurrection, when
they that have lived justly, and beleeved that he was the [[christ]], shall
(though they died naturall bodies) rise spirituall bodies [[body]]; and then it
is, that our saviour shall [[judge]] the [[world]], and conquer his adversaries,
and make a spirituall common-wealth. in the mean [[time]], seeing there are
no [[men]] on [[earth]], whose bodies [[body]] are spirituall; there can be no spirituall
common-wealth amongst [[men]] that are yet in the flesh; unlesse wee call
preachers, that have commission to [[teach]], and prepare [[men]] for
their reception into the kingdome of [[christ]] at the resurrection, a
common-wealth; which i have proved to bee none.

the third argument is this; "it is not lawfull for christians [[christian]] to
tolerate an infidel, or haereticall [[king]], in case he endeavour to draw
them to his haeresie, or infidelity. but to [[judge]] whether a [[king]] draw
his subjects [[subject]] to haeresie, or not, belongeth to the [[pope]]. therefore hath
the [[pope]] [[right]], to determine whether the [[prince]] be to be deposed, or not
deposed."

to this i [[answer]], that both these assertions are false. for christians [[christian]],
(or [[men]] of what [[religion]] soever,) if they tolerate not their [[king]],
whatsoever [[law]] hee maketh, though it bee concerning [[religion]], doe
violate their [[faith]], contrary to the [[divine]] [[law]], both naturall and
positive: nor is there any [[judge]] of haeresie amongst subjects [[subject]], but
their own civill soveraign; for "haeresie is nothing else, but a private
opinion, obstinately maintained, contrary to the [[opinion]] which the
publique [[person]] (that is to say, the representant of the common-wealth)
hath commanded to bee taught." by which it is manifest, that an
opinion publiquely appointed to bee taught, cannot be haeresie; nor the
soveraign princes [[prince]] that authorize them, haeretiques. for haeretiques are
none but private [[men]], that stubbornly defend some doctrine, prohibited
by their lawful soveraigns.

but to prove that christians [[christian]] are not to tolerate infidell, or
haereticall kings [[king]], he alledgeth a place in deut. 17. where god
forbiddeth the [[jews]], when they shall set a [[king]] over themselves, to
choose a stranger; and from thence inferreth, that it is unlawfull for
a [[christian]], to choose a [[king]], that is not a [[christian]]. and ’tis true,
that he that is a [[christian]], that is, hee that hath already obliged
himself to receive our saviour when he shall come, for his [[king]], shal
tempt [[god]] too much in choosing for [[king]] in this [[world]], one that hee
knoweth will endeavour, both by terrour, and perswasion to make him
violate his [[faith]]. but, it is (saith hee) the same danger, to choose one
that is not a [[christian]], for [[king]], and not to depose him, when hee
is chosen. to this i say, the [[question]] is not of the danger of not
deposing; but of the [[justice]] of deposing him. to choose him, may in some
cases bee [[unjust]]; but to depose him, when he is chosen, is in no case
just. for it is alwaies violation of [[faith]], and consequently against the
law of [[nature]], which is the eternal [[law]] of [[god]]. nor doe wee [[read]], that
any such doctrine was accounted [[christian]] in the [[time]] of the [[apostles]];
nor in the [[time]] of the romane emperours, till the popes had the civill
soveraignty of [[rome]]. but to this he hath replyed, that the christians [[christian]] of
old, deposed not nero, nor diocletian, nor julian, nor valens an arrian,
for this cause onely, that they wanted temporall forces [[force]]. perhaps so. but
did our saviour, who for calling for, might have had twelve legions
of immortall, invulnerable angels to assist him, want forces [[force]] to depose
caesar, or at least pilate, that unjustly, without finding [[fault]] in him,
delivered him to the [[jews]] to bee crucified? or if the [[apostles]] wanted
temporall forces [[force]] to depose nero, was it therefore necessary for them in
their epistles to the new made christians [[christian]], to [[teach]] them, (as they did)
to obey the powers [[power]] constituted over them, (whereof nero in that [[time]] was
one,) and that they ought to obey them, not for [[fear]] of their wrath,
but for [[conscience]] sake? shall we say they did not onely obey, but also
teach what they meant not, for want of [[strength]]? it is not therefore
for want of [[strength]], but for [[conscience]] sake, that christians [[christian]] are to
tolerate their heathen princes [[prince]], or princes [[prince]] (for i cannot call any one
whose doctrine is the publique doctrine, an haeretique) that authorize
the teaching of an errour. and whereas for the temporall [[power]] of the
pope, he alledgeth further, that st. paul (1 cor. 6.) appointed judges
under the heathen princes [[prince]] of those times [[time]], such as were not ordained by
those princes [[prince]]; it is not true. for st. paul does but advise them,
to take some of their brethren [[brother]] to compound their differences, as
arbitrators, rather than to goe to [[law]] one with another before the
heathen judges [[judge]]; which is a wholsome precept, and full of charity, fit
to bee practised also in the [[best]] [[christian]] common-wealths. and for
the danger that may arise to [[religion]], by the subjects [[subject]] tolerating of an
heathen, or an erring [[prince]], it is a point, of which a [[subject]] is no
competent [[judge]]; or if hee bee, the popes temporall subjects [[subject]] may judge
also of the popes doctrine. for every [[christian]] [[prince]], as i have
formerly proved, is no lesse supreme pastor of his own subjects [[subject]], than
the [[pope]] of his.

the fourth argument, is taken from the baptisme of kings [[king]]; wherein, that
they may be made christians [[christian]] they submit their scepters to [[christ]]; and
promise to keep, and defend the [[christian]] [[faith]]. this is true; for
christian kings [[king]] are no more but christs subjects [[subject]]: but they may, for all
that, bee the popes fellowes; for they are supreme [[pastors]] of their own
subjects; and the [[pope]] is no more but [[king]], and pastor, even in [[rome]] it
selfe.

the fifth argument, is drawn from the words spoken by our saviour, feed
my sheep; by which was give all [[power]] necessary for a pastor; as the
power to chase away wolves, such as are haeretiques; the [[power]] to shut
up rammes, if they be mad, or push at the other sheep with their hornes,
such as are evill (though christian) kings [[king]]; and [[power]] to give the flock
convenient food: from whence hee inferreth, that st. peter had these
three powers [[power]] given him by [[christ]]. to which i [[answer]], that the [[last]] of
these powers [[power]], is no more than the [[power]], or rather command to [[teach]].
for the first, which is to chase away wolves, that is, haeretiques, the
place hee quoteth is (matth. 7.15.) "beware of false prophets [[prophet]] which
come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves."
but neither are haeretiques false prophets [[prophet]], or at all prophets [[prophet]]: nor
(admitting haeretiques for the wolves there meant,) were the apostles
commanded to kill them, or if they were kings [[king]], to depose them; but to
beware of, fly, and avoid them: nor was it to st. peter, nor to any of
the [[apostles]], but to the multitude of the [[jews]] that followed him into
the mountain, [[men]] for the most part not yet converted, that hee gave
this counsell, to beware of false prophets [[prophet]]: which therefore if it
conferre a [[power]] of chasing away kings [[king]], was given, not onely to private
men; but to [[men]] that were not at all christians [[christian]]. and as to the power
of separating, and shutting up of furious rammes, (by which hee meaneth
christian kings [[king]] that refuse to submit themselves to the roman pastor,)
our saviour refused to take upon him that [[power]] in this [[world]] himself,
but advised to let the corn and tares grow up together till the day of
judgment: much lesse did hee give it to st. peter, or can s. peter give
it to the popes. st. peter, and all other [[pastors]], are bidden to esteem
those christians [[christian]] that disobey the [[church]], that is, (that disobey the
christian soveraigne) as heathen [[men]], and as publicans. seeing then men
challenge to the [[pope]] no [[authority]] over heathen princes [[prince]], they ought to
challenge none over those that are to bee esteemed as heathen.

but from the [[power]] to [[teach]] onely, hee inferreth also a coercive power
in the [[pope]], over kings [[king]]. the pastor (saith he) must give his flock
convenient food: therefore the [[pope]] may, and ought to compell kings [[king]] to
doe their [[duty]]. out of which it followeth, that the [[pope]], as pastor of
christian [[men]], is [[king]] of kings [[king]]: which all [[christian]] kings [[king]] ought indeed
either to confesse, or else they ought to take upon themselves the
supreme pastorall charge, every one in his own dominion.

his sixth, and [[last]] argument, is from examples [[example]]. to which i [[answer]],
first, that examples [[example]] prove nothing; secondly, that the examples [[example]] he
alledgeth make not so much as a probability of [[right]]. the [[fact]] of
jehoiada, in killing athaliah (2 kings [[king]] 11.) was either by the authority
of [[king]] joash, or it was a horrible crime in the high [[priest]], which
(ever after the election of [[king]] saul) was a mere [[subject]]. the [[fact]] of
st. ambrose, in excommunicating theodosius the emperour, (if it were
true hee did so,) was a capitall crime. and for the popes, gregory 1.
greg. 2. zachary, and leo 3. their judgments [[judgment]] are void, as given in their
own cause; and the acts done by them conformably to this doctrine, are
the [[greatest]] crimes (especially that of zachary) that are incident to
humane [[nature]]. and thus much of [[power]] ecclesiasticall; wherein i had
been more briefe, forbearing to examine these arguments of bellarmine,
if they had been his, as a private [[man]], and not as the champion of the
papacy, against all other [[christian]] princes [[prince]], and states.



chapter xliii. of what is necessary for a mans [[man]] reception into the
kingdome of [[heaven]].




the difficulty of obeying [[god]] and [[man]] both at once

the most frequent praetext of sedition, and civill warre, in christian
common-wealths hath a long [[time]] proceeded from a difficulty, not yet
sufficiently resolved, of obeying at once, both [[god]], and [[man]], then
when their commandements are one contrary to the other. it is manifest
enough, that when a [[man]] receiveth two contrary commands, and knows [[know]] that
one of them is gods, he ought to obey that, and not the other, though
it be the command even of his lawfull soveraign (whether a monarch, or
a soveraign assembly,) or the command of his [[father]]. the difficulty
therefore consisteth in this, that [[men]] when they are commanded in the
name of [[god]], [[know]] not in divers cases, whether the command be from [[god]],
or whether he that commandeth, doe but [[abuse]] gods name for some private
ends of his own. for as there ware in the [[church]] of the [[jews]], many false
prophets, that sought [[reputation]] with the [[people]], by feigned dreams [[dream]], and
visions; so there have been in all times [[time]] in the [[church]] of [[christ]], false
teachers, that seek [[reputation]] with the [[people]], by phantasticall and
false doctrines; and by such [[reputation]] (as is the [[nature]] of [[ambition]],)
to govern them for their private benefit.




is none to them that distinguish between what is, and what is not
necessary to salvation

but this difficulty of obeying both [[god]], and the civill soveraign on
earth, to those that can distinguish between what is necessary, and what
is not necessary for their reception into the kingdome of [[god]], is of no
moment. for if the command of the civill soveraign bee such, as that it
may be obeyed, without the forfeiture of [[life]] eternall; not to obey it
is [[unjust]]; and the precept of the apostle takes place; "servants obey
your masters in all things;" and, "children obey your parents in all
things;" and the precept of our saviour, "the scribes and pharisees sit
in [[moses]] chaire, all therefore they shall say, that observe, and doe."
but if the command be such, as cannot be obeyed, without being damned
to eternall [[death]], then it were madnesse to obey it, and the counsell
of our saviour takes place, (mat. 10. 28.) "fear not those that kill the
body, but cannot kill the soule." all [[men]] therefore that would avoid,
both the punishments [[punishment]] that are to be in this [[world]] inflicted, for
disobedience to their earthly soveraign, and those that shall be
inflicted in the [[world]] to come for disobedience to [[god]], have need be
taught to distinguish well between what is, and what is not necessary to
eternall salvation.




all that is necessary to salvation is contained in [[faith]] and obedience

all that is necessary to salvation, is contained in two vertues, faith
in [[christ]], and [[obedience]] to laws [[law]]. the latter of these, if it were
perfect, were enough to us. but because wee are all guilty of
disobedience to gods [[law]], not onely originally in adam, but also
actually by our own transgressions, there is required at our hands now,
not onely [[obedience]] for the rest of our [[time]], but also a remission of
sins for the [[time]] [[past]]; which remission is the [[reward]] of our faith
in [[christ]]. that nothing else is necessarily required to salvation, is
manifest from this, that the kingdome of [[heaven]], is shut to none but
to sinners; that is to say, to the disobedient, or transgressors of the
law; nor to them, in case they repent, and beleeve all the articles of
christian [[faith]], necessary to salvation.




what [[obedience]] is necessary;

the [[obedience]] required at our hands by [[god]], that accepteth in all our
actions the will for the deed, is a serious endeavour to obey him;
and is called also by all such names as signifie that endeavour. and
therefore [[obedience]], is sometimes called by the names of charity, and
love, because they imply a will to obey; and our saviour himself maketh
our [[love]] to [[god]], and to one another, a fulfilling of the whole [[law]]: and
sometimes by the name of righteousnesse; for righteousnesse is but the
will to give to every one his owne, that is to say, the will to obey
the laws [[law]]: and sometimes by the name of repentance; because to repent,
implyeth a turning away from sinne, which is the same, with the return
of the will to [[obedience]]. whosoever therefore unfeignedly desireth
to fulfill the commandements of [[god]], or repenteth him truely of his
transgressions, or that loveth [[god]] with all his [[heart]], and his neighbor
as himself, hath all the [[obedience]] necessary to his reception into the
kingdome of [[god]]: for if [[god]] should require [[perfect]] innocence, there
could no flesh be saved.




and to what laws

but what commandements are those that [[god]] hath given us? are all
those laws [[law]] which were given to the [[jews]] by the hand of [[moses]], the
commandements of [[god]]? if they bee, why are not christians [[christian]] taught to obey
them? if they be not, what others are so, besides the [[law]] of [[nature]]? for
our saviour [[christ]] hath not given us new laws [[law]], but counsell to observe
those wee are [[subject]] to; that is to say, the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], and the
laws of our severall soveraigns: nor did he make any new [[law]] to the jews
in his sermon on the mount, but onely expounded the laws [[law]] of [[moses]], to
which they were [[subject]] before. the laws [[law]] of [[god]] therefore are none
but the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], whereof the principall is, that we should
not violate our [[faith]], that is, a commandement to obey our civill
soveraigns, which wee constituted over us, by mutuall pact one with
another. and this [[law]] of [[god]], that commandeth [[obedience]] to the law
civill, commandeth by consequence [[obedience]] to all the precepts of the
bible, which (as i have proved in the precedent chapter) is there onely
law, where the civill soveraign hath made it so; and in other places but
counsell; which a [[man]] at his own perill, may without [[injustice]] refuse to
obey.




in the [[faith]] of a [[christian]], who is the [[person]] beleeved

knowing now what is the [[obedience]] necessary to salvation, and to whom
it is due; we are to consider next concerning [[faith]], whom, and why we
beleeve; and what are the articles, or points necessarily to be beleeved
by them that shall be saved. and first, for the [[person]] whom we beleeve,
because it is impossible to beleeve any [[person]], before we [[know]] what he
saith, it is necessary he be one that wee have heard speak. the person
therefore, whom [[abraham]], isaac, jacob, [[moses]] and the prophets [[prophet]] beleeved,
was [[god]] himself, that spake unto them supernaturally: and the [[person]],
whom the [[apostles]] and disciples that conversed with [[christ]] beleeved, was
our saviour himself. but of them, to whom neither [[god]] the [[father]], nor
our saviour ever spake, it cannot be said, that the [[person]] whom they
beleeved, was [[god]]. they beleeved the [[apostles]], and after them the
pastors and doctors of the [[church]], that recommended to their [[faith]] the
history of the old and new testament: so that the [[faith]] of christians
ever since our saviours [[time]], hath had for foundation, first, the
reputation of their [[pastors]], and afterward, the [[authority]] of those that
made the old and new testament to be received for the [[rule]] of [[faith]];
which none could do but [[christian]] soveraignes; who are therefore the
supreme [[pastors]], and the onely persons [[person]], whom christians [[christian]] now hear speak
from [[god]]; except such as [[god]] speaketh to, in these days supernaturally.
but because there be many false prophets [[prophet]] "gone out into the [[world]],"
other [[men]] are to examine such spirits (as st. john advised us, 1
epistle, chap. 4. ver.1.) "whether they be of [[god]], or not." and
therefore, seeing the examination of doctrines belongeth to the supreme
pastor, the [[person]] which all they that have no speciall revelation are
to beleeve, is (in every common-wealth) the supreme pastor, that is to
say, the civill soveraigne.




the causes of [[christian]] faith

the causes why [[men]] beleeve any [[christian]] doctrine, are various; for
faith is the gift of [[god]]; and he worketh it in each severall [[man]], by
such wayes, as it seemeth [[good]] unto himself. the most ordinary immediate
cause of our beleef, concerning any point of [[christian]] [[faith]], is, that
wee beleeve the bible to be the word of [[god]]. but why wee beleeve the
bible to be the word of [[god]], is much disputed, as all questions [[question]] must
needs bee, that are not well stated. for they make not the question
to be, "why we beleeve it," but "how wee [[know]] it;" as if beleeving and
knowing were all one. and thence while one side ground their knowledge
upon the infallibility of the [[church]], and the other side, on the
testimony of the private spirit, neither side concludeth what it
pretends. for how shall a [[man]] [[know]] the infallibility of the [[church]], but
by knowing first the infallibility of the [[scripture]]? or how shall a man
know his own private spirit to be other than a beleef, grounded upon the
authority, and arguments of his teachers; or upon a presumption of his
own gifts? besides, there is nothing in the [[scripture]], from which can be
inferred the infallibility of the [[church]]; much lesse, of any particular
church; and least of all, the infallibility of any particular [[man]].




faith comes by hearing

it is manifest, therefore, that [[christian]] [[men]] doe not [[know]], but onely
beleeve the [[scripture]] to be the word of [[god]]; and that the means of
making them beleeve which [[god]] is pleased to afford [[men]] ordinarily, is
according to the way of [[nature]], that is to say, from their teachers.
it is the doctrine of st. paul concerning [[christian]] [[faith]] in generall,
(rom. 10.17.) "faith cometh by hearing," that is, by hearing our lawfull
pastors. he saith also (ver. 14,15. of the same chapter) "how shall
they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear
without a preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent?"
whereby it is evident, that the ordinary cause of beleeving that the
scriptures are the word of [[god]], is the same with the cause of the
beleeving of all other articles of our [[faith]], namely, the hearing of
those that are by the [[law]] allowed and appointed to [[teach]] us, as our
parents in their houses, and our [[pastors]] in the churches [[church]]: which also
is made more manifest by [[experience]]. for what other cause can there bee
assigned, why in [[christian]] common-wealths all [[men]] either beleeve, or
at least professe the [[scripture]] to bee the word of [[god]], and in other
common-wealths scarce any; but that in [[christian]] common-wealths they
are taught it from their infancy; and in other places they are taught
otherwise?

but if teaching be the cause of [[faith]], why doe not all beleeve? it is
certain therefore that [[faith]] is the gift of [[god]], and hee giveth it to
whom he will. neverthelesse, because of them to whom he giveth it, he
giveth it by the means of teachers, the immediate cause of [[faith]] is
hearing. in a school where many are taught, and some [[profit]], others
profit not, the cause of learning in them that [[profit]], is the master;
yet it cannot be thence inferred, that learning is not the gift of [[god]].
all [[good]] things proceed from [[god]]; yet cannot all that have them, say
they are inspired; for that implies a gift supernaturall, and the
immediate hand of [[god]]; which he that pretends to, pretends to be a
prophet, and is [[subject]] to the examination of the [[church]].

but whether [[men]] [[know]], or beleeve, or grant the scriptures [[scripture]] to be the word
of [[god]]; if out of such places of them, as are without obscurity, i
shall shew what articles of [[faith]] are necessary, and onely necessary for
salvation, those [[men]] must needs [[know]], beleeve, or grant the same.

the onely necessary article of [[christian]] [[faith]], the (unum necessarium)
onely article of [[faith]], which the [[scripture]] maketh simply necessary to
salvation, is this, that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]]. by the name of [[christ]], is
understood the [[king]], which [[god]] had before promised by the prophets [[prophet]] of
the old testament, to send into the [[world]], to reign (over the [[jews]],
and over such of other nations as should beleeve in him) under himself
eternally; and to give them that eternall [[life]], which was lost by the
sin of adam. which when i have proved out of [[scripture]], i will further
shew when, and in what sense some other articles may bee also called
necessary.




proved from the scope of the evangelists

for proof that the beleef of this article, [[jesus]] is the [[christ]], is all
the [[faith]] required to salvation, my first argument shall bee from the
scope of the evangelists; which was by the description of the [[life]] of
our saviour, to establish that one article, [[jesus]] is the [[christ]]. the
summe of st. matthews gospell is this, that [[jesus]] was of the stock of
david; born of a virgin; which are the marks of the true [[christ]]: that
the magi came to [[worship]] him as [[king]] of the [[jews]]: that herod for the
same cause sought to kill him: that john baptist proclaimed him: that
he preached by himselfe, and his [[apostles]] that he was that [[king]]; that
he taught the [[law]], not as a scribe, but as a [[man]] of [[authority]]: that he
cured diseases by his word onely, and did many other [[miracles]], which
were foretold the [[christ]] should doe: that he was saluted [[king]] when he
entered into [[jerusalem]]: that he fore-warned them to beware of all others
that should pretend to be [[christ]]: that he was taken, accused, and put
to [[death]], for saying, hee was [[king]]: that the cause of his condemnation
written on the crosse, was [[jesus]] of nazareth, the [[king]] of the jewes.
all which tend to no other end than this, that [[men]] should beleeve,
that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]]. such therefore was the scope of st. matthews
gospel. but the scope of all the evangelists (as may appear by reading
them) was the same. therefore the scope of the whole gospell, was the
establishing of that onely article. and st. john expressely makes it his
conclusion, john 20. 31. "these things are written, that you may know
that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]], the [[son]] of the living [[god]]."




from the sermons of the [[apostles]]:

my second argument is taken from the [[subject]] of the sermons of the
apostles, both whilest our saviour lived on [[earth]], and after his
ascension. the [[apostles]] in our saviours [[time]] were sent, luke 9.2. to
preach the kingdome of [[god]]: for neither there, nor mat. 10.7. giveth he
any commission to them, other than this, "as ye go, preach, saying, the
kingdome of [[heaven]] is at hand;" that is, that [[jesus]] is the messiah, the
christ, the [[king]] which was to come. that their preaching also after his
ascension was the same, is manifest out of acts 17.6. "they drew (saith
st. luke) jason and [[certain]] brethren [[brother]] unto the rulers of the [[city]],
crying, these that have turned the [[world]] upside down are come hither
also, whom jason hath received. and these all do contrary to the decrees
of caesar, saying, that there is another [[king]], one [[jesus]]:" and out of
the 2.&3. verses of the same [[chapter]], where it is said, that st. paul
"as his manner was, went in unto them; and three [[sabbath]] dayes reasoned
with them out of the scriptures [[scripture]]; opening and alledging, that [[christ]] must
needs have [[suffered]], and risen againe from the [[dead]], and that this jesus
(whom he preached) is [[christ]]."




from the easinesse of the doctrine:

the third argument is, from those places of [[scripture]], by which all the
faith required to salvation is declared to be easie. for if an inward
assent of the [[mind]] to all the doctrines concerning [[christian]] [[faith]] now
taught, (whereof the [[greatest]] part are disputed,) were necessary to
salvation, there would be nothing in the [[world]] so hard, as to be a
christian. the thief upon the crosse though repenting, could not have
been saved for saying, "lord [[remember]] me when thou commest into thy
kingdome;" by which he testified no beleefe of any other article, but
this, that [[jesus]] was the [[king]]. nor could it bee said (as it is mat.
11. 30.) that "christs yoke is easy, and his burthen [[light]]:" nor that
"little [[children]] beleeve in him," as it is matth. 18.6. nor could st.
paul have said (1 cor. 1. 21.) "it pleased [[god]] by the foolishnesse of
preaching, to save them that beleeve:" nor could st. paul himself have
been saved, much lesse have been so [[great]] a doctor of the church
so suddenly, that never perhaps [[thought]] of transsubstantiation, nor
purgatory, nor many other articles now obtruded.




from formall and cleer texts

the fourth argument is taken from places expresse, and such as receive
no controversie of interpretation; as first, john 5. 39. "search the
scriptures, for in them yee thinke yee have eternall [[life]]; and they are
they that testifie of mee." our saviour here speaketh of the scriptures
onely of the old testament; for the [[jews]] at that [[time]] could not search
the scriptures [[scripture]] of the new testament, which were not written. but the old
testament hath nothing of [[christ]], but the markes by which [[men]] might
know him when hee came; as that he should descend from [[david]], be born at
bethlehem, and of a virgin; doe [[great]] [[miracles]], and the like. therefore
to beleeve that this [[jesus]] was he, was sufficient to eternall [[life]]: but
more than sufficient is not necessary; and consequently no other article
is required. again, (john 11. 26.) "whosoever liveth and beleeveth in
mee, shall not [[die]] eternally," therefore to beleeve in [[christ]], is faith
sufficient to eternall [[life]]; and consequently no more [[faith]] than that
is necessary, but to beleeve in [[jesus]], and to beleeve that [[jesus]] is the
christ, is all one, as appeareth in the verses immediately following.
for when our saviour (verse 26.) had said to martha, "beleevest thou
this?" she answereth (verse 27.) "yea [[lord]], i beleeve that thou art [[arts]] the
christ, the [[son]] of [[god]], which should come into the [[world]];" therefore
this article alone is [[faith]] sufficient to [[life]] eternall; and more than
sufficient is not necessary. thirdly, john 20. 31. "these things are
written that yee might beleeve, that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]], the [[son]] of
god, and that beleeving yee might have [[life]] through his name." there, to
beleeve that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]], is [[faith]] sufficient to the obtaining
of [[life]]; and therefore no other article is necessary. fourthly, 1 john
4. 2. "every spirit that confesseth that [[jesus]] [[christ]] is come in the
flesh, is of [[god]]." and 1 joh. 5. 1. "whosoever beleeveth that [[jesus]] is
the [[christ]], is born of [[god]]." and verse 5. "who is hee that overcommeth
the [[world]], but he that beleeveth that [[jesus]] is the [[son]] of [[god]]?" fiftly,
act. 8. ver. 36, 37. "see (saith the eunuch) here is water, what doth
hinder me to be baptized? and philip said, if thou beleevest with all
thy [[heart]] thou mayst. and hee answered and said, i beleeve that jesus
christ is the [[son]] of [[god]]." therefore this article beleeved, [[jesus]] is the
christ, is sufficient to baptisme, that is to say, to our reception into
the kingdome of [[god]], and by consequence, onely necessary. and generally
in all places where our saviour saith to any [[man]], "thy [[faith]] hath saved
thee," the cause he saith it, is some [[confession]], which directly, or by
consequence, implyeth a beleef, that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]].




from that it is the foundation of all other articles

the [[last]] argument is from the places, where this article is made the
foundation of [[faith]]: for he that holdeth the foundation shall bee saved.
which places are first, mat. 24.23. "if any [[man]] shall say unto you, loe,
here is [[christ]], or there, beleeve it not, for there shall arise false
christs, and false prophets [[prophet]], and shall shew [[great]] signes and wonders,
&c." here wee see, this article [[jesus]] is the [[christ]], must bee held,
though hee that shall [[teach]] the contrary should doe [[great]] [[miracles]]. the
second place is gal. 1. 8. "though we, or an angell from [[heaven]] preach
any other gospell unto you, than that wee have preached unto you, let
him bee accursed." but the gospell which paul, and the other [[apostles]],
preached, was onely this article, that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]]; therefore
for the beleef of this article, we are to reject the [[authority]] of
an angell from [[heaven]]; much more of any mortall [[man]], if he [[teach]] the
contrary. this is therefore the fundamentall article of [[christian]] [[faith]].
a third place is, 1 joh. 4.1. "beloved, beleeve not every spirit. hereby
yee shall [[know]] the spirit of [[god]]; every spirit that confesseth that
jesus [[christ]] is come in the flesh, is of [[god]]." by which it is evident,
that this article, is the measure, and [[rule]], by which to estimate,
and examine all other articles; and is therefore onely fundamentall.
a fourth is, matt. 16.18. where after st. peter had professed this
article, saying to our saviour, "thou art [[arts]] [[christ]] the [[son]] of the living
god," our saviour answered, "thou art [[arts]] peter, and upon this rock i will
build my [[church]]:" from whence i inferre, that this article is that,
on which all other doctrines of the [[church]] are built, as on their
foundation. a fift is (1 cor. 3. ver. 11, 12, &c.) "other foundation can
no [[man]] lay, than that which is laid, [[jesus]] is the [[christ]]. now if any man
build upon this foundation, gold, silver, pretious stones, wood, hay,
stubble; every mans [[man]] [[work]] shall be made manifest; for the day shall
declare it, because it shall be revealed by [[fire]], and the [[fire]] shall try
every mans [[man]] [[work]], of what sort it is. if any mans [[man]] [[work]] abide, which he
hath built thereupon, he shall receive a [[reward]]: if any mans [[man]] [[work]] shall
bee burnt, he shall suffer losse; but he himself shall be saved, yet so
as by [[fire]]." which words, being partly plain and easie to [[understand]],
and partly allegoricall and difficult; out of that which is plain, may
be inferred, that [[pastors]] that [[teach]] this foundation, that [[jesus]] is the
christ, though they draw from it false consequences, (which all [[men]] are
sometimes [[subject]] to,) they may neverthelesse bee saved; much more that
they may bee saved, who being no [[pastors]], but hearers, beleeve that
which is by their lawfull [[pastors]] taught them. therefore the beleef of
this article is sufficient; and by consequence there is no other article
of [[faith]] necessarily required to salvation.

now for the part which is allegoricall, as "that the [[fire]] shall try
every mans [[man]] [[work]]," and that "they shall be saved, but so as by [[fire]],"
or "through [[fire]]," (for the originall is dia puros,) it maketh nothing
against this conclusion which i have drawn from the other words, that
are plain. neverthelesse, because upon this place there hath been an
argument taken, to prove the [[fire]] of [[purgatory]], i will also here offer
you my conjecture concerning the meaning of this triall of doctrines,
and saving of [[men]] as by [[fire]]. the apostle here seemeth to allude to
the words of the [[prophet]] zachary, ch. 13. 8,9. who speaking of the
restauration of the kingdome of [[god]], saith thus, "two parts therein
shall be cut off, and [[die]], but the third shall be left therein; and
i will bring the third part through the [[fire]], and will refine them as
silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tryed; they shall call
on the name of the [[lord]], and i will hear them." the day of [[judgment]], is
the day of the restauration of the kingdome of [[god]]; and at that day
it is, that st. peter tells us (2 pet. 3. v.7, 10, 12.) shall be the
conflagration of the [[world]], wherein the wicked shall perish; but the
remnant which [[god]] will save, shall passe through that [[fire]], unhurt,
and be therein (as silver and gold are refined by the [[fire]] from their
drosse) tryed, and refined from their idolatry, and be made to call upon
the name of the true [[god]]. alluding whereto st. paul here saith, that the
day (that is, the day of [[judgment]], the [[great]] day of our saviours comming
to restore the kingdome of [[god]] in israel) shall try every mans [[man]] doctrine,
by judging, which are gold, silver, pretious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
and then they that have built false consequences on the true foundation,
shall see their doctrines condemned; neverthelesse they themselves
shall be saved, and passe unhurt through this universall [[fire]], and live
eternally, to call upon the name of the true and onely [[god]]. in which
sense there is nothing that accordeth not with the rest of holy
scripture, or any glimpse of the [[fire]] of [[purgatory]].




in what sense other articles may be called necessary

but a [[man]] may here aske, whether it bee not as necessary to salvation,
to beleeve, that [[god]] is omnipotent; creator of the [[world]]; that jesus
christ is risen; and that all [[men]] else shall rise again from the dead
at the [[last]] day; as to beleeve, that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]]. to which i
answer, they are; and so are many more articles: but they are such, as
are contained in this one, and may be deduced from it, with more, or
lesse difficulty. for who is there that does not see, that they
who beleeve [[jesus]] to be the [[son]] of the [[god]] of [[israel]], and that the
israelites had for [[god]] the omnipotent creator of all things, doe therein
also beleeve, that [[god]] is the omnipotent creator of all things? or how
can a [[man]] beleeve, that [[jesus]] is the [[king]] that shall reign eternally,
unlesse hee beleeve him also risen again from the [[dead]]? for a [[dead]] man
cannot exercise the office of a [[king]]. in summe, he that holdeth this
foundation, [[jesus]] is the [[christ]], holdeth expressely all that hee
seeth rightly deduced from it, and implicitely all that is consequent
thereunto, though he have not [[skill]] enough to discern the consequence.
and therefore it holdeth still [[good]], that the beleef of this one article
is sufficient [[faith]] to obtaine remission of sinnes to the penitent, and
consequently to bring them into the kingdome of [[heaven]].




that [[faith]], and [[obedience]] are both of them necessary to salvation

now that i have shewn, that all the [[obedience]] required to salvation,
consisteth in the will to obey the [[law]] of [[god]], that is to say, in
repentance; and all the [[faith]] required to the same, is comprehended in
the beleef of this article, [[jesus]] is the [[christ]]; i will further alledge
those places of the gospell, that prove, that all that is necessary to
salvation is contained in both these joined together. the [[men]] to whom
st. peter preached on the day of pentecost, next after the ascension
of our saviour, [[asked]] him, and the rest of the [[apostles]], saying, (act.
2.37.) "men and brethren [[brother]] what shall we doe?" to whom st. peter answered
(in the next verse) "repent, and be baptized every one of you, for the
remission of sins [[sin]], and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost."
therefore repentance, and baptisme, that is, beleeving that [[jesus]] is the
christ, is all that is necessary to salvation. again, our saviour being
asked by a [[certain]] ruler, (luke 18.18.) "what shall i doe to inherit
eternall [[life]]?" answered (verse 20) "thou knowest the commandements,
doe not commit adultery, doe not kill, doe not steal, doe not bear false
witnesse, [[honor]] thy [[father]], and thy [[mother]];" which when he said he had
observed, our saviour added, "sell all thou hast, give it to the [[poor]],
and come and [[follow]] me:" which was as much as to say, relye on me that
am the [[king]]: therefore to fulfill the [[law]], and to beleeve that jesus
is the [[king]], is all that is required to bring a [[man]] to eternall [[life]].
thirdly, st. paul saith (rom. 1.17.) "the just shall [[live]] by [[faith]];" not
every one, but the just; therefore [[faith]] and [[justice]] (that is, the will
to be just, or repentance) are all that is necessary to [[life]] eternall.
and (mark 1.15.) our saviour preached, saying, "the [[time]] is fulfilled,
and the [[kingdom]] of [[god]] is at hand, repent and beleeve the evangile,"
that is, the [[good]] news that the [[christ]] was come. therefore to repent,
and to beleeve that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]], is all that is required to
salvation.




what each of them contributes thereunto

seeing then it is necessary that [[faith]], and [[obedience]] (implyed in the
word repentance) do both concurre to our salvation; the question
by which of the two we are justified, is impertinently disputed.
neverthelesse, it will not be impertinent, to make manifest in what
manner each of them contributes thereunto; and in what sense it is said,
that we are to be justified by the one, and by the other. and first,
if by righteousnesse be understood the [[justice]] of the works [[work]] themselves,
there is no [[man]] that can be saved; for there is none that hath not
transgressed the [[law]] of [[god]]. and therefore when wee are said to be
justified by works [[work]], it is to be understood of the will, which [[god]] doth
alwaies accept for the [[work]] it selfe, as well in [[good]], as in evill [[men]].
and in this sense onely it is, that a [[man]] is called just, or [[unjust]]; and
that his [[justice]] justifies him, that is, gives him the title, in gods
acceptation, of just; and renders him capable of living by his [[faith]],
which before he was not. so that [[justice]] justifies in that that sense,
in which to justifie, is the same that to denominate a [[man]] just; and not
in the signification of discharging the [[law]]; whereby the [[punishment]] of
his sins [[sin]] should be [[unjust]].

but a [[man]] is then also said to be justified, when his plea, though in
it selfe unsufficient, is accepted; as when we plead our will, our
endeavour to fulfill the [[law]], and repent us of our failings, and god
accepteth it for the performance it selfe: and because [[god]] accepteth not
the will for the deed, but onely in the faithfull; it is therefore faith
that makes [[good]] our plea; and in this sense it is, that [[faith]] onely
justifies: so that [[faith]] and [[obedience]] are both necessary to salvation;
yet in severall senses each of them is said to justifie.




obedience to [[god]] and to the civill soveraign not inconsistent

whether [[christian]], having thus shewn what is necessary to salvation; it
is not hard to reconcile our [[obedience]] to the civill soveraign; who is
either [[christian]], or infidel. if he bee a [[christian]], he alloweth the
beleefe of this article, that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]]; and of all the
articles that are contained in, or are evident consequence deduced from
it: which is all the [[faith]] necessary to salvation. and because he is a
soveraign, he requireth [[obedience]] to all his owne, that is, to all the
civill laws [[law]]; in which also are contained all the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], that
is, all the laws [[law]] of [[god]]: for besides the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], and the laws [[law]] of
the [[church]], which are part of the civill [[law]], (for the [[church]] that
can make laws [[law]] is the common-wealth,) there bee no other laws [[law]] [[divine]].
whosoever therefore obeyeth his [[christian]] soveraign, is not thereby
hindred, neither from beleeving, nor from obeying [[god]]. but suppose that
a [[christian]] [[king]] should from this foundation, [[jesus]] is the [[christ]], draw
some false consequences, that is to say, make some superstructions of
hay, or stubble, and command the teaching of the same; yet seeing st.
paul says, he shal be saved; much more shall he be saved, that teacheth
them by his command; and much more yet, he that teaches [[teach]] not, but onely
beleeves his lawfull teacher. and in case a [[subject]] be forbidden by
the civill soveraign to professe some of those his opinions [[opinion]], upon
what grounds can he disobey? [[christian]] kings [[king]] may erre in deducing a
consequence, but who shall [[judge]]? shall a private [[man]] [[judge]], when the
question is of his own [[obedience]]? or shall any [[man]] judg but he that is
appointed thereto by the [[church]], that is, by the civill soveraign that
representeth it? or if the [[pope]], or an apostle [[judge]], may he not erre
in deducing of a consequence? did not one of the two, st. peter, or st.
paul erre in a superstructure, when st. paul withstood st. peter to his
face? there can therefore be no contradiction between the laws [[law]] of [[god]],
and the laws [[law]] of a [[christian]] common-wealth.




or infidel

and when the civill soveraign is an infidel, every one of his own
subjects that resisteth him, sinneth against the laws [[law]] of [[god]] (for such
as are the laws [[law]] of [[nature]],) and rejecteth the counsell of the [[apostles]],
that admonisheth all christians [[christian]] to obey their princes [[prince]], and all children
and servants to obey they parents, and masters, in all things. and for
their [[faith]], it is internall, and invisible; they have the licence that
naaman had, and need not put themselves into danger for it. but if they
do, they ought to expect their [[reward]] in [[heaven]], and not [[complain]] of
their lawfull soveraign; much lesse make warre upon him. for he that
is not glad of any just [[occasion]] of martyrdome, has not the [[faith]] be
professeth, but pretends it onely, to set some colour upon his own
contumacy. but what infidel [[king]] is so unreasonable, as knowing he has
a [[subject]], that waiteth for the second comming of [[christ]], after the
present [[world]] shall be burnt, and intendeth then to obey him (which is
the intent of beleeving that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]],) and in the mean time
thinketh himself bound to obey the laws [[law]] of that infidel [[king]], (which
all christians [[christian]] are obliged in [[conscience]] to doe,) to put to [[death]], or to
persecute such a [[subject]]?

and thus much shall suffice, concerning the kingdome of [[god]], and policy
ecclesiasticall. wherein i pretend not to advance any position of
my own, but onely to shew what are the consequences that seem to me
deducible from the principles [[principle]] of [[christian]] politiques, (which are the
holy scriptures [[scripture]],) in confirmation of the [[power]] of civill soveraigns, and
the [[duty]] of their subjects [[subject]]. and in the allegation of [[scripture]], i have
endeavoured to avoid such texts as are of obscure, or controverted
interpretation; and to alledge none, but is such sense as is most plain,
and agreeable to the harmony and scope of the whole bible; which was
written for the re-establishment of the kingdome of [[god]] in [[christ]]. for
it is not the bare words, but the scope of the writer that giveth the
true [[light]], by which any writing is to bee interpreted; and they that
insist upon [[single]] texts, without considering the main designe, can
derive no thing from them cleerly; but rather by casting atomes of
scripture, as dust before mens [[men]] [[eyes]], make every thing more obscure than
it is; an ordinary artifice of those that seek not the [[truth]], but their
own advantage.




part iv.
of the kingdome of darknesse




chapter xliv. of spirituall darknesse from misinterpretation of
scripture




the kingdome of darknesse what

besides these soveraign powers [[power]], [[divine]], and humane, of which i have
hitherto discoursed, there is mention in [[scripture]] of another [[power]],
namely, (eph. 6. 12.), that of "the rulers of the darknesse of this
world," (mat. 12. 26.), "the kingdome of [[satan]]," and, (mat. 9. 34.), "the
principality of beelzebub over daemons," that is to say, over phantasmes
that appear in the air: for which cause [[satan]] is also called (eph. 2.
2.) "the [[prince]] of the [[power]] of the air;" and (because he ruleth in the
darknesse of this world) (joh. 16. 11.) "the [[prince]] of this [[world]];" and
in consequence hereunto, they who are under his dominion, in opposition
to the faithfull (who are the [[children]] of the light) are called the
children of darknesse. for seeing beelzebub is [[prince]] of phantasmes,
inhabitants of his dominion of air and darknesse, the [[children]] of
darknesse, and these daemons, phantasmes, or spirits of illusion,
signifie allegorically the same thing. this considered, the kingdome
of darknesse, as it is set forth in these, and other places of the
scripture, is nothing else but a "confederacy of deceivers, that to
obtain dominion over [[men]] in this [[present]] [[world]], endeavour by dark, and
erroneous doctrines, to extinguish in them the [[light]], both of [[nature]],
and of the gospell; and so to dis-prepare them for the kingdome of god
to come."




the [[church]] not yet fully freed of darknesse

as [[men]] that are utterly deprived from their nativity, of the light
of the bodily eye, have no [[idea]] at all, of any such [[light]]; and no man
conceives in his [[imagination]] any greater [[light]], than he hath at some
time, or other perceived by his outward senses: so also is it of the
light of the gospel, and of the [[light]] of the understanding, that no man
can conceive there is any greater [[degree]] of it, than that which he hath
already attained unto. and from hence it comes to passe, that men
have no other means to acknowledge their owne darknesse, but onely by
reasoning from the un-forseen mischances, that befall them in their
ways; the darkest part of the kingdome of [[satan]], is that which is
without the [[church]] of [[god]]; that is to say, amongst them that beleeve not
in [[jesus]] [[christ]]. but we cannot say, that therefore the [[church]] enjoyeth
(as the [[land]] of goshen) all the [[light]], which to the performance of
the [[work]] enjoined us by [[god]], is necessary. whence comes it, that in
christendome there has been, almost from the [[time]] of the [[apostles]],
such justling of one another out of their places, both by forraign,
and civill [[war]]? such stumbling at every little asperity of their own
fortune, and every little eminence of that of other [[men]]? and such
diversity of ways in running to the same mark, felicity, if it be not
night amongst us, or at least a mist? wee are therefore yet in the dark.




four causes of spirituall darknesse

the [[enemy]] has been here in the night of our naturall ignorance, and sown
the tares of spirituall errors; and that, first, by abusing, and
putting out the [[light]] of the scriptures [[scripture]]: for we erre, not knowing the
scriptures. secondly, by introducing the daemonology of the heathen
poets, that is to say, their fabulous doctrine concerning daemons, which
are but idols, or phantasms of the braine, without any reall [[nature]] of
their own, distinct from humane fancy; such as are [[dead]] mens [[men]] ghosts, and
fairies, and other matter of old wives [[wife]] tales. thirdly, by mixing with
the [[scripture]] divers reliques of the [[religion]], and much of the [[vain]] and
erroneous [[philosophy]] of the greeks [[greek]], especially of [[aristotle]]. fourthly,
by mingling with both these, false, or uncertain traditions, and
fained, or uncertain [[history]]. and so we come to erre, by "giving heed
to seducing spirits," and the daemonology of such "as speak lies [[lie]] in
hypocrisie," (or as it is in the originall, 1 tim. 4.1,2. "of those that
play the part of lyars") "with a seared [[conscience]]," that is, contrary
to their own [[knowledge]]. concerning the first of these, which is the
seducing of [[men]] by [[abuse]] of [[scripture]], i intend to speak briefly in this
chapter.




errors from misinterpreting the scriptures [[scripture]], concerning the kingdome
of god

the [[greatest]], and main [[abuse]] of [[scripture]], and to which almost all the
rest are either consequent, or subservient, is the wresting of it, to
prove that the kingdome of [[god]], mentioned so often in the [[scripture]], is
the [[present]] [[church]], or multitude of [[christian]] [[men]] now living, or that
being [[dead]], are to rise again at the [[last]] day: whereas the kingdome of
god was first instituted by the ministery of [[moses]], over the [[jews]] onely;
who were therefore called his peculiar [[people]]; and ceased afterward, in
the election of saul, when they refused to be governed by [[god]] any more,
and demanded a [[king]] after the manner of the nations; which [[god]] himself
consented unto, as i have more at large proved before, in the 35.
chapter. after that [[time]], there was no other kingdome of [[god]] in the
world, by any pact, or otherwise, than he ever was, is, and shall be
king, of all [[men]], and of all creatures, as governing according to his
will, by his infinite [[power]]. neverthelesse, he promised by his prophets
to restore this his [[government]] to them again, when the [[time]] he hath in
his secret counsell appointed for it shall bee fully come, and when they
shall turn unto him by repentance, and amendment of [[life]]; and not
onely so, but he invited also the gentiles to come in, and enjoy the
happinesse of his reign, on the same conditions of conversion and
repentance; and hee promised also to send his [[son]] into the [[world]], to
expiate the sins [[sin]] of them all by his [[death]], and to prepare them by his
doctrine, to receive him at his second coming: which second coming not
yet being, the kingdome of [[god]] is not yet come, and wee are not now
under any other kings [[king]] by pact, but our civill soveraigns; saving onely,
that [[christian]] [[men]] are already in the kingdome of grace, in as much as
they have already the promise of being received at his comming againe.




as that the kingdome of [[god]] is the [[present]] church

consequent to this errour, that the [[present]] [[church]] is christs kingdome,
there ought to be some one [[man]], or assembly, by whose mouth our saviour
(now in heaven) speaketh, giveth [[law]], and which representeth his person
to all christians [[christian]], or divers [[men]], or divers assemblies that doe the same
to divers parts of christendome. this [[power]] regal under [[christ]], being
challenged, universally by that [[pope]], and in particular common-wealths
by assemblies of the [[pastors]] of the place, (when the [[scripture]] gives it
to none but to civill soveraigns,) comes to be so passionately disputed,
that it putteth out the [[light]] of [[nature]], and causeth so [[great]] a
darknesse in mens [[men]] understanding, that they see not who it is to whom
they have engaged their [[obedience]].




and that the [[pope]] is his vicar generall

consequent to this claim of the [[pope]] to vicar generall of [[christ]] in the
present [[church]], (supposed to be that [[kingdom]] of his, to which we are
addressed in the gospel,) is the doctrine, that it is necessary for a
christian [[king]], to receive his [[crown]] by a bishop; as if it were from
that [[ceremony]], that he derives the clause of dei gratia in his title;
and that then onely he is made [[king]] by the favour of [[god]], when he is
crowned by the [[authority]] of gods universall viceregent on [[earth]]; and
that every bishop whosoever be his soveraign, taketh at his consecration
an oath of absolute [[obedience]] to the [[pope]], consequent to the same, is
the doctrine of the fourth councell of lateran, held under [[pope]] innocent
the third, (chap. 3. de haereticis.) "that if a [[king]] at the popes
admonition, doe not purge his kingdome of haeresies, and being
excommunicate for the same, doe not give satisfaction within a year,
his subjects [[subject]] are absolved of the bond of their [[obedience]]." where, by
haeresies are understood all opinions [[opinion]] which the [[church]] of [[rome]] hath
forbidden to be maintained. and by this means, as often as there is
any repugnancy between the politicall designes of the [[pope]], and other
christian princes [[prince]], as there is very often, there ariseth such a mist
amongst their subjects [[subject]], that they [[know]] not a stranger that thrusteth
himself into the [[throne]] of their lawfull [[prince]], from him whom they
had themselves placed there; and in this darknesse of [[mind]], are made to
fight one against another, without discerning their enemies [[enemy]] from their
friends, under the conduct of another mans [[man]] [[ambition]].




and that the [[pastors]] are the clergy

from the same [[opinion]], that the [[present]] [[church]] is the kingdome of [[god]],
it proceeds that pastours, deacons, and all other ministers of the
church, take the name to themselves of the clergy, giving to other
christians the name of laity, that is, simply [[people]]. for clergy
signifies those, whose maintenance is that [[revenue]], which [[god]] having
reserved to himselfe during his reigne over the israelites, assigned
to the tribe of levi (who were to be his publique ministers, and had no
portion of [[land]] set them out to [[live]] on, as their brethren) to be their
inheritance. the [[pope]] therefore, (pretending the [[present]] [[church]] to be,
as the realme of [[israel]], the kingdome of god) challenging to himselfe
and his subordinate ministers, the like [[revenue]], as the [[inheritance]] of
god, the name of clergy was sutable to that claime. and thence it is,
that tithes, or other tributes paid to the levites, as gods [[right]],
amongst the israelites, have a long [[time]] been demanded, and taken of
christians, by ecclesiastiques, jure divino, that is, in gods [[right]]. by
which meanes, the [[people]] every where were obliged to a double tribute;
one to the [[state]], another to the clergy; whereof, that to the clergy,
being the tenth of their [[revenue]], is double to that which a [[king]] of
athens (and esteemed a tyrant) exacted of his subjects [[subject]] for the defraying
of all publique charges: for he demanded no more but the twentieth part;
and yet abundantly maintained therewith the commonwealth. and in the
kingdome of the jewes, during the sacerdotall reigne of [[god]], the tithes
and offerings were the whole publique [[revenue]].

from the same mistaking of the [[present]] [[church]] for the [[kingdom]] of [[god]],
came in the distinction betweene the civill and the canon laws [[law]]: the
civil [[law]] being the acts of soveraigns in their own dominions, and
the canon [[law]] being the acts of the [[pope]] in the same dominions. which
canons, though they were but canons, that is, rules [[rule]] propounded, and but
voluntarily received by [[christian]] princes [[prince]], till the translation of
the [[empire]] to charlemain; yet afterwards, as the [[power]] of the pope
encreased, became rules [[rule]] commanded, and the emperours themselves (to
avoyd greater mischiefes, which the [[people]] blinded might be [[led]] into)
were forced to let them passe for laws [[law]].

from hence it is, that in all dominions, where the popes ecclesiasticall
power is entirely received, jewes, turkes, and gentiles, are in the
roman [[church]] tolerated in their [[religion]], as farre forth, as in the
exercise and profession thereof they offend not against the civill
power: whereas in a [[christian]], though a stranger, not to be of the roman
religion, is capitall; because the [[pope]] pretendeth that all christians
are his subjects [[subject]]. for otherwise it were as much against the [[law]] of
nations, to [[persecute]] a [[christian]] stranger, for professing the religion
of his owne [[country]], as an infidell; or rather more, in as much as they
that are not against [[christ]], are with him.

from the same it is, that in every [[christian]] [[state]] there are certaine
men, that are exempt, by ecclesiasticall [[liberty]], from the tributes, and
from the tribunals of the civil [[state]]; for so are the secular clergy,
besides monks and friars, which in many places, bear so [[great]] a
proportion to the [[common]] [[people]], as if need were, there might be raised
out of them alone, an [[army]], sufficient for any warre the [[church]] militant
should imploy them in, against their owne, or other princes [[prince]].




error from mistaking consecration for conjuration

a second generall [[abuse]] of [[scripture]], is the turning of consecration
into conjuration, or enchantment. to consecrate, is in [[scripture]], to
offer, give, or dedicate, in pious and decent [[language]] and gesture, a
man, or any other thing to [[god]], by separating of it from [[common]] use;
that is to say, to sanctifie, or make it gods, and to be used only by
those, whom [[god]] hath appointed to be his publike ministers, (as i have
already proved at large in the 35. [[chapter]];) and thereby to [[change]], not
the thing consecrated, but onely the use of it, from being profane
and [[common]], to be holy, and peculiar to gods service. but when by such
words, the [[nature]] of qualitie of the thing it selfe, is pretended to be
changed, it is not consecration, but either an extraordinary worke of
god, or a vaine and impious conjuration. but seeing (for the frequency
of pretending the [[change]] of [[nature]] in their consecrations,) it cannot
be esteemed a [[work]] extraordinary, it is no other than a conjuration or
incantation, whereby they would have [[men]] to beleeve an alteration of
nature that is not, contrary to the testimony of mans [[man]] sight, and of all
the rest of his senses. as for [[example]], when the [[priest]], in stead of
consecrating bread and wine to gods peculiar service in the sacrament of
the lords [[lord]] supper, (which is but a separation of it from the [[common]] use,
to signifie, that is, to put [[men]] in [[mind]] of their redemption, by the
passion of [[christ]], whose [[body]] was broken, and [[blood]] shed upon the crosse
for our transgressions,) pretends, that by saying of the words of our
saviour, "this is my [[body]]," and "this is my [[blood]]," the [[nature]] of bread
is no more there, but his very [[body]]; notwithstanding there appeared not
to the sight, or other sense of the receiver, any thing that appeareth
not before the consecration. the egyptian conjurers, that are said
to have turned their rods to serpents, and the water into bloud, are
thought but to have deluded the senses of the spectators by a false shew
of things, yet are esteemed enchanters: but what should wee have thought
of them, if there had appeared in their rods nothing like a serpent, and
in the water enchanted, nothing like bloud, nor like any thing else but
water, but that they had faced down the [[king]], that they were serpents
that looked like rods, and that it was bloud that seemed water? that
had been both enchantment, and lying. and yet in this daily act of
the [[priest]], they doe the very same, by turning the holy words into the
manner of a charme, which produceth nothing now to the sense; but they
face us down, that it hath turned the bread into a [[man]]; nay more, into
a [[god]]; and require [[men]] to [[worship]] it, as if it were our saviour himself
present [[god]] and [[man]], and thereby to commit most grosse idolatry. for if
it bee enough to excuse it of idolatry, to say it is no more bread, but
god; why should not the same excuse serve the [[egyptians]], in case they
had the faces to say, the leeks, and onyons they worshipped, were
not very leeks, and onyons, but a divinity under their [[species]], or
likenesse. the words, "this is my [[body]]," are aequivalent to these,
"this signifies, or represents my [[body]];" and it is an ordinary figure of
speech: but to take it literally, is an [[abuse]]; nor though so taken, can
it extend any further, than to the bread which [[christ]] himself with his
own hands consecrated. for hee never said, that of what bread soever,
any [[priest]] whatsoever, should say, "this is my [[body]]," or, "this is
christs [[body]]," the same should presently be transubstantiated. nor did
the [[church]] of [[rome]] ever establish this transubstantiation, till the time
of [[innocent]] the third; which was not above 500. years agoe, when the
power of popes was at the highest, and the darknesse of the [[time]] grown
so [[great]], as [[men]] discerned not the bread that was given them to [[eat]],
especially when it was stamped with the figure of [[christ]] upon the
crosse, as if they would have [[men]] beleeve it were transubstantiated, not
onely into the [[body]] of [[christ]], but also into the wood of his crosse, and
that they did [[eat]] both together in the sacrament.




incantation in the ceremonies [[ceremony]] of baptisme

the like incantation, in stead of consecration, is used also in the
sacrament of baptisme: where the [[abuse]] of gods name in each severall
person, and in the whole trinity, with the sign of the crosse at each
name, maketh up the charm: as first, when they make the holy water, the
priest saith, "i conjure thee, thou creature of water, in the name of
god the [[father]] almighty, and in the name of [[jesus]] [[christ]] his onely son
our [[lord]], and in vertue of the holy ghost, that thou become conjured
water, to drive away all the powers [[power]] of the [[enemy]], and to eradicate, and
supplant the [[enemy]], &c." and the same in the benediction of the salt
to be mingled with it; "that thou become conjured salt, that all
phantasmes, and knavery of the devills fraud may fly and depart from the
place wherein thou art [[arts]] sprinkled; and every unclean spirit bee conjured
by him that shall come to [[judge]] the quicke and the [[dead]]." the same in
the benediction of the oyle. "that all the [[power]] of the [[enemy]], all the
host of the devill, all assaults and phantasmes of [[satan]], may be
driven away by this creature of oyle." and for the infant that is to be
baptized, he is [[subject]] to many charms; first, at the [[church]] dore the
priest blows thrice in the childs face, and sayes, "goe out of him
unclean spirit, and give place to the holy ghost the comforter." as
if all [[children]], till blown on by the [[priest]] were daemoniaques: again,
before his entrance into the [[church]], he saith as before, "i conjure
thee, &c. to goe out, and depart from this servant of [[god]]:" and again
the same exorcisme is repeated once more before he be baptized. these,
and some other incantations, and consecrations, in administration of the
sacraments of baptisme, and the lords [[lord]] supper; wherein every thing that
serveth to those holy [[men]] (except the unhallowed spittle of the priest)
hath some set form of exorcisme.




in [[marriage]], in visitation of the sick, and in consecration of places

nor are the other rites, as of [[marriage]], of extreme unction, of
visitation of the sick, of consecrating churches [[church]], and church-yards, and
the like, exempt from charms; in as much as there is in them the use of
enchanted oyle, and water, with the [[abuse]] of the crosse, and of the holy
word of [[david]], "asperges me domine hyssopo," as things of efficacy to
drive away phantasmes, and imaginery spirits.




errors from mistaking eternall [[life]], and everlasting death

another generall error, is from the misinterpretation of the words
eternall [[life]], everlasting [[death]], and the second [[death]]. for though we
read plainly in holy [[scripture]], that [[god]] created adam in an estate of
living for ever, which was conditionall, that is to say, if he disobeyed
not his commandement; which was not essentiall to humane [[nature]], but
consequent to the vertue of the tree of [[life]]; whereof hee had liberty
to [[eat]], as long as hee had not sinned; and that hee was thrust out of
paradise after he had sinned, lest hee should eate thereof, and [[live]] for
ever; and that christs passion is a discharge of [[sin]] to all that beleeve
on him; and by consequence, a restitution of eternall [[life]], to all the
faithfull, and to them onely: yet the doctrine is now, and hath been a
long [[time]] far otherwise; namely, that every [[man]] hath eternity of [[life]] by
nature, in as much as his [[soul]] is immortall: so that the flaming sword
at the entrance of paradise, though it hinder a [[man]] from coming to the
tree of [[life]], hinders him not from the immortality which [[god]] took from
him for his [[sin]]; nor makes him to need the sacrificing of [[christ]], for
the recovering of the same; and consequently, not onely the faithfull
and righteous, but also the wicked, and the heathen, shall enjoy
eternall [[life]], without any [[death]] at all; much lesse a second, and
everlasting [[death]]. to salve this, it is said, that by second, and
everlasting [[death]], is meant a second, and everlasting [[life]], but in
torments; a figure never used, but in this very case.

all which doctrine is founded onely on some of the obscurer places of
the new testament; which neverthelesse, the whole scope of the scripture
considered, are cleer enough in a different sense, and unnecessary to
the [[christian]] [[faith]]. for supposing that when a [[man]] dies, there remaineth
nothing of him but his carkasse; cannot [[god]] that raised inanimated dust
and clay into a living creature by his word, as easily raise a dead
carkasse to [[life]] again, and continue him alive for ever, or make him
die again, by another word? the soule in [[scripture]], signifieth alwaies,
either the [[life]], or the living creature; and the [[body]] and soule jointly,
the [[body]] alive. in the fift day of the creation, [[god]] said, let the water
produce reptile animae viventis, the creeping thing that hath in it a
living soule; the english translate it, "that hath [[life]]:" and again,
god created whales, "& omnem animam viventem;" which in the english is,
"every living creature:" and likewise of [[man]], [[god]] made him of the dust
of the [[earth]], and breathed in his face the breath of [[life]], "& factus est
homo in animam viventem," that is, "and [[man]] was made a living creature;"
and after noah came out of the arke, [[god]] saith, hee will no more smite
"omnem animam viventem," that is "every living creature;" and deut.
12.23. "eate not the bloud, for the bloud is the soule;" that is
"the [[life]]." from which places, if by soule were meant a substance
incorporeall, with an existence separated from the [[body]], it might as
well be inferred of any other living creature, as of [[man]]. but that
the souls [[soul]] of the faithfull, are not of their own [[nature]], but by gods
speciall grace, to remaine in their bodies [[body]], from the resurrection to
all eternity, i have already i [[think]] sufficiently proved out of the
scriptures, in the 38. [[chapter]]. and for the places of the new testament,
where it is said that any [[man]] shall be cast [[body]] and [[soul]] into hell
fire, it is no more than [[body]] and [[life]]; that is to say, they shall be
cast alive into the perpetuall [[fire]] of gehenna.




as the doctrine of [[purgatory]], and exorcismes, and invocation of saints

this window it is, that gives entrance to the dark doctrine, first, of
eternall torments; and afterwards of [[purgatory]], and consequently of the
walking abroad, especially in places consecrated, solitary, or dark, of
the ghosts of [[men]] deceased; and thereby to the pretences of exorcisme
and conjuration of phantasmes; as also of invocation of [[men]] [[dead]]; and to
the doctrine of indulgences; that is to say, of exemption for a [[time]],
or for ever, from the [[fire]] of [[purgatory]], wherein these incorporeall
substances are pretended by burning to be cleansed, and made fit
for [[heaven]]. for [[men]] being generally possessed before the [[time]] of our
saviour, by contagion of the daemonology of the greeks [[greek]], of an [[opinion]],
that the souls [[soul]] of [[men]] were substances distinct from their bodies [[body]], and
therefore that when the [[body]] was [[dead]], the soule of every [[man]], whether
godly, or wicked, must subsist somewhere by vertue of its own [[nature]],
without acknowledging therein any supernaturall gift of gods; the
doctors of the [[church]] doubted a long [[time]], what was the place, which
they were to abide in, till they should be re-united to their bodies [[body]] in
the resurrection; supposing for a while, they lay under the altars: but
afterward the [[church]] of [[rome]] found it more profitable, to build for them
this place of [[purgatory]]; which by some other churches [[church]] in this later [[age]],
has been demolished.




the texts alledged for the doctrines aforementioned have been answered
before

let us now consider, what texts of [[scripture]] seem most to confirm these
three generall errors, i have here touched. as for those which cardinall
bellarmine hath alledged, for the [[present]] kingdome of [[god]] administred by
the [[pope]], (than which there are none that make a [[better]] show of proof,)
i have already answered them; and made it evident, that the kingdome
of [[god]], instituted by [[moses]], ended in the election of saul: after which
time the [[priest]] of his own [[authority]] never deposed any [[king]]. that which
the high [[priest]] did to athaliah, was not done in his own [[right]], but in
the [[right]] of the [[young]] [[king]] joash her [[son]]: but solomon in his own right
deposed the high [[priest]] abiathar, and set up another in his place. the
most difficult place to [[answer]], of all those than can be brought,
to prove the kingdome of [[god]] by [[christ]] is already in this [[world]], is
alledged, not by bellarmine, nor any other of the [[church]] of [[rome]]; but
by beza; that will have it to begin from the resurrection of [[christ]].
but whether hee intend thereby, to entitle the presbytery to the supreme
power ecclesiasticall in the common-wealth of geneva, (and consequently
to every presbytery in every other common-wealth,) or to princes [[prince]],
and other civill soveraignes, i doe not [[know]]. for the presbytery hath
challenged the [[power]] to excommunicate their owne kings [[king]], and to bee the
supreme moderators in [[religion]], in the places where they have that form
of [[church]] [[government]], no lesse then the [[pope]] challengeth it universally.




answer to the text on which beza infereth

that the kingdome of [[christ]] began at the resurrection the words are
(marke 9.1.) "verily, i say unto you, that there be some of them that
stand here, which shall not tast of [[death]], till they have seene the
kingdome of [[god]] come with [[power]]." which words, if taken grammatically,
make it certaine, that either some of those [[men]] that stood by [[christ]] at
that [[time]], are yet alive; or else, that the kingdome of [[god]] must be now
in this [[present]] [[world]]. and then there is another place more difficult:
for when the [[apostles]] after our saviours resurrection, and immediately
before his ascension, [[asked]] our saviour, saying, (acts.1.6.) "wilt thou
at this [[time]] restore again the kingdome to [[israel]]," he answered them,
"it is not for you to [[know]] the times [[time]] and the seasons, which the father
hath put in his own [[power]]; but ye shall receive [[power]] by the comming of
the holy ghost upon you, and yee shall be my (martyrs) witnesses both in
jerusalem, & in all judaea, and in samaria, and unto the uttermost part
of the [[earth]]:" which is as much as to say, my kingdome is not yet come,
nor shall you foreknow when it shall come, for it shall come as a theefe
in the night; but i will send you the holy ghost, and by him you shall
have [[power]] to beare witnesse to all the [[world]] (by your preaching) of
my resurrection, and the workes i have done, and the doctrine i have
taught, that they may beleeve in me, and expect eternall [[life]], at my
comming againe: how does this agree with the comming of christs kingdome
at the resurrection? and that which st. paul saies (1 thessal. 1.9, 10.)
"that they turned from idols, to serve the living and true [[god]], and
to waite for his sonne from [[heaven]]:" where to waite for his sonne from
heaven, is to wait for his comming to be [[king]] in [[power]]; which were
not necessary, if this kingdome had beene then [[present]]. againe, if the
kingdome of [[god]] began (as beza on that place (mark 9.1.) would have it)
at the resurrection; what [[reason]] is there for christians [[christian]] ever since the
resurrection to say in their prayers, "let thy kingdome come"? it
is therefore manifest, that the words of st. mark are not so to be
interpreted. there be some of them that stand here (saith our saviour)
that shall not tast of [[death]] till they have seen the kingdome of god
come in [[power]]. if then this kingdome were to come at the resurrection
of [[christ]], why is it said, "some of them" rather than all? for they all
lived till after [[christ]] was risen.




explication of the place in mark 9.1

but they that require an exact interpretation of this text, let them
interpret first the like words of our saviour to st. peter concerning
st. john, (chap. 21.22.) "if i will that he tarry till i come, what is
that to thee?" upon which was grounded a report that hee should not dye:
neverthelesse the [[truth]] of that report was neither confirmed, as well
grounded; nor refuted, as ill grounded on those words; but left as a
saying not understood. the same difficulty is also in the place of st.
marke. and if it be lawfull to conjecture at their meaning, by that
which immediately followes, both here, and in st. luke, where the same
is againe repeated, it is not unprobable, to say they have relation
to the transfiguration, which is described in the verses immediately
following; where it is said, that "after six dayes [[jesus]] taketh with
him peter, and james, and john (not all, but some of his disciples)
and leadeth them up into an high mountaine apart by themselves, and
was transfigured before them. and his rayment became shining, exceeding
white as snow; so as no fuller on [[earth]] can [[white]] them. and there
appeared unto them elias with [[moses]], and they were talking with [[jesus]],
&c." so that they saw [[christ]] in [[glory]] and majestie, as he is to come;
insomuch as "they were sore afraid." and thus the promise of our saviour
was accomplished by way of vision: for it was a vision, as may probably
bee inferred out of st. luke, that reciteth the same story (ch. 9. ve.
28.) and saith, that peter and they that were with him, were heavy with
sleep; but most certainly out of matth. 17.9. (where the same is again
related;) for our saviour charged them, saying, "tell no [[man]] the vision
untill the [[son]] of [[man]] be risen from the [[dead]]." howsoever it be, yet
there can from thence be taken no argument, to prove that the kingdome
of [[god]] taketh beginning till the day of judgement.




abuse of some other texts in defence of the [[power]] of the pope

as for some other texts, to prove the popes [[power]] over civill
soveraignes (besides those of bellarmine;) as that the two swords [[sword]] that
christ and his [[apostles]] had amongst them, were the spirituall and the
temporall [[sword]], which they say st. peter had given him by [[christ]]: and,
that of the two luminaries, the greater signifies the [[pope]], and the
lesser the [[king]]; one might as well inferre out of the first verse of the
bible, that by [[heaven]] is meant the [[pope]], and by [[earth]] the [[king]]: which
is not arguing from [[scripture]], but a wanton insulting over princes [[prince]], that
came in [[fashion]] after the [[time]] the popes were growne so secure of their
greatnesse, as to contemne all [[christian]] kings [[king]]; and treading on the
necks of emperours, to mocke both them, and the [[scripture]], in the words
of the 91. psalm, "thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder, the
young lion and the dragon thou shalt trample under thy feet."




the manner of consecrations in the [[scripture]], was without exorcisms

as for the rites of consecration, though they depend for the most part
upon the discretion and judgement of the governors of the [[church]],
and not upon the scriptures [[scripture]]; yet those governors are obliged to such
direction, as the [[nature]] of the action it selfe requireth; as that the
ceremonies, words, and gestures, be both decent, and significant, or at
least conformable to the action. when [[moses]] consecrated the tabernacle,
the altar, and the vessels belonging to them (exod. 40.) he anointed
them with the oyle which [[god]] had commanded to bee made for that
purpose; and they were holy; there was nothing exorcised, to drive away
phantasmes. the same [[moses]] (the civill soveraigne of israel) when he
consecrated aaron (the high [[priest]],) and his sons [[son]], did wash them with
water, (not exorcised water,) put their garments upon them, and anointed
them with oyle; and they were sanctified, to minister unto the lord
in the priests [[priest]] office; which was a simple and decent cleansing, and
adorning them, before hee presented them to [[god]], to be his servants.
when [[king]] solomon, (the civill soveraigne of israel) consecrated the
temple hee had built, (2 kings [[king]] 8.) he stood before all the congregation
of [[israel]]; and having blessed them, he gave thanks to [[god]], for putting
into the [[heart]] of his [[father]], to build it; and for giving to himselfe
the grace to accomplish the same; and then prayed unto him, first,
to accept that house, though it were not sutable to his infinite
greatnesse; and to hear the prayers of his servants that should pray
therein, or (if they were absent) towards it; and lastly, he offered a
sacrifice of peace-offering, and the house was dedicated. here was no
procession; the [[king]] stood still in his first place; no exorcised water;
no asperges me, nor other impertinent application of words spoken upon
another [[occasion]]; but a decent, and rationall [[speech]], and such as in
making to [[god]] a [[present]] of his new built house, was most conformable
to the [[occasion]]. we [[read]] not that st. john did exorcise the water
of jordan; nor philip the water of the river wherein he baptized the
eunuch; nor that any pastor in the [[time]] of the [[apostles]], did take his
spittle, and put it to the nose of the [[person]] to be baptized, and say,
"in odorem suavitatis," that is, "for a sweet savour unto the [[lord]];"
wherein neither the [[ceremony]] of spittle, for the uncleannesse; nor the
application of that [[scripture]] for the levity, can by any [[authority]] of
man be justified.




the immortality of mans [[man]] soule, not proved by [[scripture]] to be of [[nature]],
but of grace

to prove that the soule separated from the [[body]] liveth eternally, not
onely the soules of the elect, by especiall grace, and restauration of
the eternall [[life]] which adam lost by sinne, and our saviour restored
by the [[sacrifice]] of himself, to the faithfull, but also the soules
of reprobates, as a [[property]] naturally consequent to the essence of
mankind, without other grace of [[god]], but that which is universally given
to all [[mankind]]; there are divers places, which at the first sight seem
sufficiently to serve the turn: but such, as when i compare them with
that which i have before (chapter 38.) alledged out of the 14 of [[job]],
seem to mee much more [[subject]] to a divers interpretation, than the words
of [[job]].

and first there are the words of solomon (ecclesiastes 12.7.) "then
shall the dust return to dust, as it was, and the spirit shall return to
god that gave it." which may bear well enough (if there be no other text
directly against it) this interpretation, that [[god]] onely knows [[know]], (but
man not,) what becomes of a mans [[man]] spirit, when he expireth; and the same
solomon, in the same [[book]], (chap. 3. ver. 20,21.) delivereth in the same
sentence in the sense i have given it: his words are, "all goe, (man
and beast) to the same place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust
again; who knoweth that the spirit of [[man]] goeth upward, and the spirit
of the beast goeth downward to the [[earth]]?" that is, none knows [[know]] but [[god]];
nor is it an unusuall phrase to say of things we [[understand]] not, "god
knows what," and "god knows [[know]] where." that of gen. 5.24. "enoch walked
with [[god]], and he was not; for [[god]] took him;" which is expounded heb.
13.5. "he was translated, that he should not [[die]]; and was not found,
because [[god]] had translated him. for before his translation, he had this
testimony, that he pleased [[god]]," making as much for the immortality
of the [[body]], as of the soule, proveth, that this his translation was
peculiar to them that please [[god]]; not [[common]] to them with the wicked;
and depending on grace, not on [[nature]]. but on the contrary, what
interpretation shall we give, besides the literall sense of the words of
solomon (eccles. 3.19.) "that which befalleth the sons [[son]] of [[men]], befalleth
beasts, even one thing befalleth them; as the one dyeth, so doth the
other; yea, they have all one breath (one spirit;) so that a [[man]] hath no
praeeminence above a beast, for all is vanity." by the literall sense,
here is no naturall immortality of the soule; nor yet any repugnancy
with the [[life]] eternall, which the elect shall enjoy by grace. and (chap.
4. ver.3.) "better is he that hath not yet been, than both they;" that
is, than they that [[live]], or have lived; which, if the soule of all them
that have lived, were immortall, were a hard saying; for then to have
an immortall soule, were worse than to have no soule at all. and
againe,(chapt. 9.5.) "the living [[know]] they shall [[die]], but the [[dead]] know
not any thing;" that is, naturally, and before the resurrection of the
body.

another place which seems to make for a naturall immortality of the
soule, is that, where our saviour saith, that [[abraham]], isaac, and jacob
are living: but this is spoken of the promise of [[god]], and of their
certitude to rise again, not of a [[life]] then actuall; and in the same
sense that [[god]] said to adam, that on the day hee should eate of the
forbidden fruit, he should certainly [[die]]; from that [[time]] forward he was
a [[dead]] [[man]] by sentence; but not by execution, till almost a thousand
years after. so [[abraham]], isaac, and jacob were alive by promise, then,
when [[christ]] spake; but are not actually till the resurrection. and the
history of dives and lazarus, make nothing against this, if wee take it
(as it is) for a parable.

but there be other places of the new testament, where an immortality
seemeth to be directly attributed to the wicked. for it is evident, that
they shall all rise to judgement. and it is said besides in many places,
that they shall goe into "everlasting [[fire]], everlasting torments,
everlasting punishments [[punishment]]; and that the worm of [[conscience]] never dyeth;"
and all this is comprehended in the word everlasting [[death]], which is
ordinarily interpreted everlasting [[life]] in torments: and yet i can find
no where that any [[man]] shall [[live]] in torments everlastingly. also, it
seemeth hard, to say, that [[god]] who is the [[father]] of mercies, that doth
in [[heaven]] and [[earth]] all that hee will; that hath the hearts [[heart]] of all men
in his disposing; that worketh in [[men]] both to doe, and to will; and
without whose [[free]] gift a [[man]] hath neither inclination to [[good]], nor
repentance of evill, should punish mens [[men]] transgressions without any end
of [[time]], and with all the extremity of torture, that [[men]] can imagine,
and more. we are therefore to consider, what the meaning is, of
everlasting [[fire]], and other the like phrases of [[scripture]].

i have shewed already, that the kingdome of [[god]] by [[christ]] beginneth at
the day of [[judgment]]: that in that day, the faithfull shall rise again,
with glorious, and spirituall bodies [[body]], and bee his subjects [[subject]] in that his
kingdome, which shall be eternall; that they shall neither [[marry]], nor
be given in [[marriage]], nor eate and drink, as they did in their naturall
bodies; but [[live]] for ever in their individuall persons [[person]], without the
specificall eternity of [[generation]]: and that the reprobates also shall
rise again, to receive punishments [[punishment]] for their sins [[sin]]: as also, that those
of the elect, which shall be alive in their earthly bodies [[body]] at that
day, shall have their bodies [[body]] suddenly changed, and made spirituall, and
immortall. but that the bodies [[body]] of the reprobate, who make the kingdome
of [[satan]], shall also be glorious, or spirituall bodies [[body]], or that they
shall bee as the angels of [[god]], neither eating, nor drinking, nor
engendring; or that their [[life]] shall be eternall in their individuall
persons, as the [[life]] of every faithfull [[man]] is, or as the [[life]] of adam
had been if hee had not sinned, there is no place of [[scripture]] to prove
it; save onely these places concerning eternall torments; which may
otherwise be interpreted.

from whence may be inferred, that as the elect after the resurrection
shall be restored to the estate, wherein adam was before he had sinned;
so the reprobate shall be in the estate, that adam, and his posterity
were in after the [[sin]] committed; saving that [[god]] promised a redeemer to
adam, and such of his seed as should trust in him, and repent; but not
to them that should [[die]] in their sins [[sin]], as do the reprobate.




eternall torments what

these things considered, the texts that mention eternall [[fire]], eternal
torments, or the word that never dieth, contradict not the doctrine of
a second, and everlasting [[death]], in the proper and naturall sense of the
word [[death]]. the [[fire]], or torments prepared for the wicked in gehenna,
tophet, or in what place soever, may continue for ever; and there may
never want wicked [[men]] to be tormented in them; though not every, nor
any one eternally. for the wicked being left in the estate they were in
after adams [[sin]], may at the resurrection [[live]] as they did, [[marry]], and
give in [[marriage]], and have grosse and corruptible bodies [[body]], as all
mankind now have; and consequently may engender perpetually, after the
resurrection, as they did before: for there is no place of [[scripture]] to
the contrary. for st. paul, speaking of the resurrection (1 cor. 15.)
understandeth it onely of the resurrection to [[life]] eternall; and not the
resurrection to [[punishment]]. and of the first, he saith that the [[body]] is
"sown in [[corruption]], raised in incorruption; sown in dishonour, raised
in [[honour]]; sown in weaknesse, raised in [[power]]; sown a naturall [[body]],
raised a spirituall [[body]]:" there is no such thing can be said of the
bodies of them that rise to [[punishment]]. the text is luke 20. verses
34,35,36. a fertile text. "the [[children]] of this [[world]] [[marry]], and are
given in [[marriage]]; but they that shall be counted worthy to obtaine that
world, and the resurrection from the [[dead]], neither [[marry]], nor are given
in [[marriage]]: neither can they [[die]] any more; for they are equall to
the angells, and are the [[children]] of [[god]], being the [[children]] of the
resurrection:" the [[children]] of this [[world]], that are in the estate
which adam left them in, shall [[marry]], and be given in [[marriage]]; that is
corrupt, and generate successively; which is an immortality of the [[kind]],
but not of the persons [[person]] of [[men]]: they are not worthy to be counted amongst
them that shall obtain the next [[world]], and an absolute resurrection from
the [[dead]]; but onely a short [[time]], as inmates of that [[world]]; and to the
end onely to receive condign [[punishment]] for their contumacy. the elect
are the onely [[children]] of the resurrection; that is to say the sole
heirs of eternall [[life]]: they only can [[die]] no more; it is they that are
equall to the angels, and that are the [[children]] of [[god]]; and not the
reprobate. to the reprobate there remaineth after the resurrection,
a second, and eternall [[death]]: between which resurrection, and their
second, and eternall [[death]], is but a [[time]] of [[punishment]] and torment; and
to [[last]] by succession of sinners thereunto, as long as the [[kind]] of man
by propagation shall endure, which is eternally.




answer of the texts alledged for purgatory

upon this doctrine of the naturall eternity of separated soules, is
founded (as i said) the doctrine of [[purgatory]]. for supposing eternall
life by grace onely, there is no [[life]], but the [[life]] of the [[body]]; and no
immortality till the resurrection. the texts for [[purgatory]] alledged by
bellarmine out of the canonicall [[scripture]] of the old testament, are
first, the fasting of [[david]] for saul and jonathan, mentioned (2 kings [[king]],
1. 12.); and againe, (2 sam. 3. 35.) for the [[death]] of abner. this
fasting of [[david]], he saith, was for the obtaining of something for them
at gods hands, after their [[death]]; because after he had fasted to procure
the recovery of his owne child, assoone as he [[know]] it was [[dead]], he
called for meate. seeing then the soule hath an existence separate from
the [[body]], and nothing can be obtained by mens [[men]] fasting for the soules
that are already either in [[heaven]], or hell, it followeth that there be
some soules of [[dead]] [[men]], what are neither in [[heaven]], nor in hell; and
therefore they must bee in some third place, which must be [[purgatory]].
and thus with hard straining, hee has wrested those places to the proofe
of a [[purgatory]]; whereas it is manifest, that the ceremonies [[ceremony]] of mourning,
and fasting, when they are used for the [[death]] of [[men]], whose [[life]] was
not profitable to the mourners, they are used for honours [[honour]] sake to their
persons; and when tis done for the [[death]] of them by whose [[life]] the
mourners had benefit, it proceeds from their particular dammage: and so
david honoured saul, and abner, with his fasting; and in the [[death]] of
his owne child, recomforted himselfe, by receiving his ordinary food.

in the other places, which he alledgeth out of the old testament, there
is not so much as any shew, or colour of proofe. he brings in every text
wherein there is the word anger, or [[fire]], or burning, or purging, or
clensing, in case any of the fathers [[father]] have but in a sermon rhetorically
applied it to the doctrine of [[purgatory]], already beleeved. the first
verse of psalme, 37. "o [[lord]] rebuke me not in thy wrath, nor chasten me
in thy hot displeasure:" what were this to [[purgatory]], if augustine had
not applied the wrath to the [[fire]] of hell, and the displeasure, to that
of [[purgatory]]? and what is it to [[purgatory]], that of psalme, 66. 12. "wee
went through [[fire]] and water, and thou broughtest us to a moist place;"
and other the like texts, (with which the doctors of those times
entended to adorne, or extend their sermons, or commentaries) haled to
their purposes [[purpose]] by [[force]] of wit?




places of the new testament for [[purgatory]] answered

but he alledgeth other places of the new testament, that are not
so easie to be answered: and first that of matth. 12.32. "whosoever
speaketh a word against the sonne of [[man]], it shall be forgiven him; but
whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost, it shall not bee forgiven
him neither in this [[world]], nor in the [[world]] to come:" where he will have
purgatory to be the [[world]] to come, wherein some sinnes may be forgiven,
which in this [[world]] were not forgiven: notwithstanding that it is
manifest, there are but three worlds [[world]]; one from the creation to the
flood, which was destroyed by water, and is called in [[scripture]] the
old [[world]]; another from the flood to the day of judgement, which is the
present [[world]], and shall bee destroyed by [[fire]]; and the third, which
shall bee from the day of judgement forward, everlasting, which is
called the [[world]] to come; and in which it is agreed by all, there shall
be no [[purgatory]]; and therefore the [[world]] to come, and [[purgatory]], are
inconsistent. but what then can bee the meaning of those our saviours
words? i confesse they are very hardly to bee reconciled with all the
doctrines now unanimously received: nor is it any shame, to confesse the
profoundnesse of the [[scripture]], to bee too [[great]] to be sounded by the
shortnesse of humane understanding. neverthelesse, i may propound such
things to the consideration of more learned divines, as the text it
selfe suggesteth. and first, seeing to speake against the holy ghost, as
being the third [[person]] of the trinity, is to speake against the [[church]],
in which the holy ghost resideth; it seemeth the comparison is made,
betweene the easinesse of our saviour, in bearing with offences done to
him while he was on [[earth]], and the severity of the [[pastors]] after him,
against those which should deny their [[authority]], which was from the holy
ghost: as if he should say, you that deny my [[power]]; nay you that shall
crucifie me, shall be pardoned by mee, as often as you turne unto mee by
repentance: but if you deny the [[power]] of them that [[teach]] you hereafter,
by vertue of the holy ghost, they shall be inexorable, and shall not
forgive you, but [[persecute]] you in this [[world]], and leave you without
absolution, (though you turn to me, unlesse you turn also to them,) to
the punishments [[punishment]] (as much as lies [[lie]] in them) of the [[world]] to come: and
so the words may be taken as a prophecy, or praediction concerning the
times, as they have along been in the [[christian]] [[church]]: or if this be
not the meaning, (for i am not peremptory in such difficult places,)
perhaps there may be place left after the resurrection for the
repentance of some sinners: and there is also another place, that
seemeth to agree therewith. for considering the words of st. paul (1
cor. 15. 29.) "what shall they doe which are baptized for the [[dead]], if
the [[dead]] rise not at all? why also are they baptized for the [[dead]]?" a
man may probably inferre, as some have done, that in st. pauls [[time]],
there was a custome by receiving baptisme for the [[dead]], (as [[men]] that now
beleeve, are sureties and undertakers for the [[faith]] of infants, that
are not capable of beleeving,) to undertake for the persons [[person]] of their
deceased [[friends]], that they should be ready to obey, and receive our
saviour for their [[king]], at his coming again; and then the forgivenesse
of sins [[sin]] in the [[world]] to come, has no need of a [[purgatory]]. but in both
these interpretations, there is so much of paradox, that i trust not
to them; but propound them to those that are throughly versed in the
scripture, to inquire if there be no clearer place that contradicts
them. onely of thus much, i see evident [[scripture]], to perswade [[men]], that
there is neither the word, nor the thing of [[purgatory]], neither in this,
nor any other text; nor any thing that can prove a necessity of a place
for the soule without the [[body]]; neither for the soule of lazarus during
the four days he was [[dead]]; nor for the soules of them which the romane
church pretend to be tormented now in [[purgatory]]. for [[god]], that could
give a [[life]] to a peece of clay, hath the same [[power]] to give [[life]] again
to a [[dead]] [[man]], and renew his inanimate, and rotten carkasse, into a
glorious, spirituall, and immortall [[body]].

another place is that of 1 cor. 3. where it is said that they which
built stubble, hay, &c. on the true foundation, their [[work]] shall perish;
but "they themselves shall be saved; but as through [[fire]]:" this [[fire]], he
will have to be the [[fire]] of [[purgatory]]. the words, as i have said before,
are an allusion to those of zach. 13. 9. where he saith, "i will bring
the third part through the [[fire]], and refine them as silver is refined,
and will try them as gold is tryed;" which is spoken of the comming of
the messiah in [[power]] and [[glory]]; that is, at the day of [[judgment]], and
conflagration of the [[present]] [[world]]; wherein the elect shall not be
consumed, but be refined; that is, depose their erroneous doctrines, and
traditions, and have them as it were sindged off; and shall afterwards
call upon the name of the true [[god]]. in like manner, the apostle saith
of them, that holding this foundation [[jesus]] is the [[christ]], shall build
thereon some other doctrines that be erroneous, that they shall not be
consumed in that [[fire]] which reneweth the [[world]], but shall passe through
it to salvation; but so, as to see, and relinquish their former errours.
the builders, are the [[pastors]]; the foundation, that [[jesus]] is the [[christ]];
the stubble and hay, false consequences drawn from it through ignorance,
or frailty; the gold, silver, and pretious stones, are their true
doctrines; and their refining or purging, the relinquishing of their
errors. in all which there is no colour at all for the burning of
incorporeall, that is to say, impatible souls [[soul]].




baptisme for the [[dead]], how understood

a third place is that of 1 cor. 15. before mentioned, concerning
baptisme for the [[dead]]: out of which he concludeth, first, that prayers
for the [[dead]] are not unprofitable; and out of that, that there is a fire
of [[purgatory]]: but neither of them rightly. for of many interpretations
of the word baptisme, he approveth this in the first place, that by
baptisme is meant (metaphorically) a baptisme of penance; and that men
are in this sense baptized, when they fast, and [[pray]], and give almes:
and so baptisme for the [[dead]], and prayer of the [[dead]], is the same thing.
but this is a metaphor, of which there is no [[example]], neither in
the [[scripture]], nor in any other use of [[language]]; and which is also
discordant to the harmony, and scope of the [[scripture]]. the word baptisme
is used (mar. 10. 38. & luk. 12. 59.) for being dipped in ones own
bloud, as [[christ]] was upon the cross, and as most of the apostles
were, for giving testimony of him. but it is hard to say, that prayer,
fasting, and almes, have any similitude with dipping. the same is used
also mat. 3. 11. (which seemeth to make somewhat for purgatory) for
a purging with [[fire]]. but it is evident the [[fire]] and purging here
mentioned, is the same whereof the [[prophet]] zachary speaketh (chap. 13.
v. 9.) "i will bring the third part through the [[fire]], and will refine
them, &c." and st. peter after him (1 epist. 1. 7.) "that the triall
of your [[faith]], which is much more precious than of gold that perisheth,
though it be tryed with [[fire]], might be found unto [[praise]], and [[honour]],
and [[glory]] at the appearing of [[jesus]] [[christ]];" and st. paul (1 cor. 3.
13.) the [[fire]] shall trie every mans [[man]] [[work]] of what sort it is." but
st. peter, and st. paul speak of the [[fire]] that shall be at the second
appearing of [[christ]]; and the [[prophet]] zachary of the day of [[judgment]]: and
therefore this place of s. mat. may be interpreted of the same; and then
there will be no necessity of the [[fire]] of [[purgatory]].

another interpretation of baptisme for the [[dead]], is that which i
have before mentioned, which he preferreth to the second place of
probability; and thence also he inferreth the utility of prayer for the
dead. for if after the resurrection, such as have not heard of [[christ]],
or not beleeved in him, may be received into christs kingdome; it is
not in [[vain]], after their [[death]], that their [[friends]] should [[pray]] for them,
till they should be risen. but granting that [[god]], at the prayers of the
faithfull, may convert unto him some of those that have not heard christ
preached, and consequently cannot have rejected [[christ]], and that the
charity of [[men]] in that point, cannot be blamed; yet this concludeth
nothing for [[purgatory]], because to rise from [[death]] to [[life]], is one thing;
to rise from [[purgatory]] to [[life]] is another; and being a rising from life
to [[life]], from a [[life]] in torments to a [[life]] in joy.

a fourth place is that of mat. 5. 25. "agree with thine adversary
quickly, whilest thou art [[arts]] in the way with him, lest at any [[time]] the
adversary deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
verily i say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till
thou has paid the uttermost farthing." in which allegory, the offender
is the sinner; both the adversary and the [[judge]] is [[god]]; the way is
this [[life]]; the prison is the grave; the officer, [[death]]; from which, the
sinner shall not rise again to [[life]] eternall, but to a second [[death]],
till he have paid the utmost farthing, or [[christ]] [[pay]] it for him by his
passion, which is a full ransome for all manner of [[sin]], as well lesser
sins, as greater crimes; both being made by the passion of christ
equally veniall.

the fift place, is that of matth. 5. 22. "whosoever is angry with his
brother without a cause, shall be guilty in [[judgment]]. and whosoever
shall say to his [[brother]], racha, shall be guilty in the councel. but
whosoever shall say, thou foole, shall be guilty to hell [[fire]]." from
which words he inferreth three sorts of sins [[sin]], and three sorts of
punishments; and that none of those sins [[sin]], but the [[last]], shall be
punished with hell [[fire]]; and consequently, that after this [[life]], there
is [[punishment]] of lesser sins [[sin]] in [[purgatory]]. of which inference, there is
no colour in any interpretation that hath yet been given to them: shall
there be a distinction after this [[life]] of courts of [[justice]], as there
was amongst the [[jews]] in our saviours [[time]], to hear, and determine
divers sorts of crimes; as the judges [[judge]], and the councell? shall not
all judicature appertain to [[christ]], and his [[apostles]]? to understand
therefore this text, we are not to consider it solitarily, but jointly
with the words precedent, and subsequent. our saviour in this chapter
interpreteth the [[law]] of [[moses]]; which the [[jews]] [[thought]] was then
fulfilled, when they had not transgressed the grammaticall sense
thereof, howsoever they had transgressed against the sentence, or
meaning of the legislator. therefore whereas they [[thought]] the sixth
commandement was not broken, but by killing a [[man]]; nor the seventh, but
when a [[man]] lay with a woman, not his [[wife]]; our saviour tells them, the
inward anger of a [[man]] against his [[brother]], if it be without just cause,
is homicide: you have heard (saith hee) the [[law]] of [[moses]], "thou shalt
not kill," and that "whosoever shall kill, shall be condemned before the
judges," or before the session of the seventy: but i say unto you, to
be angry with ones [[brother]] without cause; or to say unto him racha, or
foole, is homicide, and shall be punished at the day of [[judgment]], and
session of [[christ]], and his [[apostles]], with hell [[fire]]: so that those words
were not used to distinguish between divers crimes, and divers courts
of [[justice]], and divers punishments [[punishment]]; but to taxe the distinction between
sin, and [[sin]], which the [[jews]] drew not from the difference of the will
in obeying [[god]], but from the difference of their temporall courts of
justice; and to shew them that he that had the will to hurt his [[brother]],
though the effect appear but in reviling, or not at all, shall be cast
into hell [[fire]], by the judges [[judge]], and by the session, which shall be the
same, not different courts at the day of [[judgment]]. this considered, what
can be drawn from this text, to maintain [[purgatory]], i cannot imagine.

the sixth place is luke 16. 9. "make yee [[friends]] of the unrighteous
mammon, that when yee faile, they may receive you into everlasting
tabernacles." this he alledges to prove invocation of saints departed.
but the sense is plain, that we should make [[friends]] with our riches [[rich]], of
the poore, and thereby obtain their prayers whilest they [[live]]. "he that
giveth to the poore, lendeth to the [[lord]]. "the seventh is luke 23. 42.
"lord [[remember]] me when thou commest into thy kingdome:" therefore, saith
hee, there is remission of sins [[sin]] after this [[life]]. but the consequence
is not [[good]]. our saviour then forgave him; and at his comming againe in
glory, will [[remember]] to raise him againe to [[life]] eternall.

the eight is acts 2. 24. where st. peter saith of [[christ]], "that god
had raised him up, and loosed the paines of [[death]], because it was not
possible he should be holden of it;" which hee interprets to bee a
descent of [[christ]] into [[purgatory]], to loose some soules there from their
torments; whereas it is manifest, that it was [[christ]] that was loosed;
it was hee that could not bee holden of [[death]], or the grave; and not the
souls in [[purgatory]]. but if that which beza sayes in his notes on this
place be well observed, there is none that will not see, that in stead
of paynes, it should be bands; and then there is no further cause to
seek for [[purgatory]] in this text.



chapter xlv. of daemonology, and other reliques of the [[religion]] of the
gentiles




the originall of daemonology

the impression made on the organs of sight, by lucide bodies [[body]], either in
one direct line, or in many lines, reflected from opaque, or refracted
in the passage through diaphanous bodies [[body]], produceth in living creatures,
in whom [[god]] hath placed such organs, an [[imagination]] of the object, from
whence the impression proceedeth; which [[imagination]] is called sight; and
seemeth not to bee a meer [[imagination]], but the [[body]] it selfe without
us; in the same manner, as when a [[man]] violently presseth his eye, there
appears to him a [[light]] without, and before him, which no [[man]] perceiveth
but himselfe; because there is indeed no such thing without him, but
onely a motion in the interiour organs, pressing by resistance
outward, that makes him [[think]] so. and the motion made by this pressure,
continuing after the object which caused it is removed, is that we call
imagination, and memory, and (in sleep, and sometimes in [[great]] distemper
of the organs by sicknesse, or violence) a [[dream]]: of which things i have
already spoken briefly, in the second and third chapters [[chapter]].

this [[nature]] of sight having never been discovered by the ancient
pretenders to naturall [[knowledge]]; much lesse by those that consider not
things so remote (as that [[knowledge]] is) from their [[present]] use; it was
hard for [[men]] to conceive of those images in the fancy, and in the sense,
otherwise, than of things really without us: which some (because they
vanish away, they [[know]] not whither, nor how,) will have to be absolutely
incorporeall, that is to say immateriall, of formes without matter;
colour and figure, without any coloured or figured [[body]]; and that they
can put on aiery bodies [[body]] (as a garment) to make them visible when
they will to our bodily [[eyes]]; and others say, are bodies [[body]], and living
creatures, but made of air, or other more subtile and aethereall matter,
which is, then, when they will be seen, condensed. but both of them
agree on one generall appellation of them, daemons. as if the [[dead]] of
whom they dreamed, were not inhabitants of their own brain, but of the
air, or of [[heaven]], or hell; not phantasmes, but ghosts; with just
as much [[reason]], as if one should say, he saw his own ghost in a
looking-glasse, or the ghosts of the stars in a river; or call the
ordinary apparition of the sun, of the quantity of about a foot, the
daemon, or ghost of that [[great]] sun that enlighteneth the whole visible
world: and by that means have feared them, as things of an unknown, that
is, of an unlimited [[power]] to doe them [[good]], or harme; and consequently,
given [[occasion]] to the governours of the heathen common-wealths to
regulate this their [[fear]], by establishing that daemonology (in which
the poets, as principal priests [[priest]] of the heathen [[religion]], were specially
employed, or reverenced) to the publique [[peace]], and to the [[obedience]] of
subjects necessary thereunto; and to make some of them [[good]] daemons,
and others evill; the one as a spurre to the observance, the other, as
reines to withhold them from violation of the laws [[law]].




what were the daemons of the ancients

what [[kind]] of things they were, to whom they attributed the name of
daemons, appeareth partly in the genealogie of their gods, written by
hesiod, one of the most ancient poets of the graecians; and partly in
other histories [[history]]; of which i have observed some few before, in the 12.
chapter of this discourse.




how that doctrine was spread

the graecians, by their colonies and conquests, communicated their
language and writings into [[asia]], [[egypt]], and [[italy]]; and therein, by
necessary consequence their daemonology, or (as st. paul calles it)
"their doctrines of devils [[devil]];" and by that meanes, the contagion was
derived also to the jewes, both of judaea, and alexandria, and other
parts, whereinto they were dispersed. but the name of daemon they did
not (as the graecians) attribute to spirits both [[good]], and evill; but
to the evill onely: and to the [[good]] daemons they gave the name of the
spirit of [[god]]; and esteemed those into whose bodies [[body]] they entred to be
prophets. in summe, all singularity if [[good]], they attributed to the
spirit of [[god]]; and if evill, to some daemon, but a kakodaimen, an evill
daemon, that is, a devill. and therefore, they called daemoniaques, that
is, possessed by the devill, such as we call madmen or lunatiques; or
such as had the falling sicknesse; or that spoke any thing, which they
for want of understanding, [[thought]] absurd: as also of an unclean person
in a notorious [[degree]], they used to say he had an unclean spirit; of a
dumbe [[man]], that he had a dumbe devill; and of john baptist (math. 11.
18.) for the singularity of his fasting, that he had a devill; and of
our saviour, because he said, hee that keepeth his sayings should not
see [[death]] in aeternum, (john 8. 52.) "now we [[know]] thou hast a devill;
abraham is [[dead]], and the prophets [[prophet]] are [[dead]]:" and again, because he said
(john 7. 20.) "they went about to kill him," the [[people]] answered, "thou
hast a devill, who goeth about to kill thee?" whereby it is manifest,
that the jewes had the same opinions [[opinion]] concerning phantasmes, namely, that
they were not phantasmes that is, idols of the braine, but things reall,
and independent on the fancy.




why our saviour controlled it not

which doctrine if it be not true, why (may some say) did not our saviour
contradict it, and [[teach]] the contrary? nay why does he use on diverse
occasions, such forms of [[speech]] as seem to confirm it? to this i [[answer]],
that first, where [[christ]] saith, "a spirit hath not flesh and bone,"
though hee shew that there be spirits, yet he denies not that they are
bodies: and where st. paul sais, "we shall rise spirituall bodies [[body]]," he
acknowledgeth the [[nature]] of spirits, but that they are bodily spirits;
which is not difficult to [[understand]]. for air and many other things
are bodies [[body]], though not flesh and bone, or any other grosse [[body]], to bee
discerned by the eye. but when our saviour speaketh to the devill, and
commandeth him to go out of a [[man]], if by the devill, be meant a disease,
as phrenesy, or lunacy, or a corporeal spirit, is not the speech
improper? can diseases heare? or can there be a corporeall spirit in a
body of flesh and bone, full already of vitall and animall spirits?
are there not therefore spirits, that neither have bodies [[body]], nor are meer
imaginations? to the first i [[answer]], that the addressing of our saviours
command to the madnesse, or lunacy he cureth, is no more improper, then
was his rebuking of the fever, or of the wind, and sea; for neither
do these hear: or than was the command of [[god]], to the [[light]], to the
firmament, to the sunne, and starres, when he commanded them to bee; for
they could not heare before they had a beeing. but those speeches [[speech]] are
not improper, because they signifie the [[power]] of gods word: no more
therefore is it improper, to command madnesse, or lunacy (under the
appellation of devils [[devil]], by which they were then commonly understood,)
to depart out of a mans [[man]] [[body]]. to the second, concerning their being
incorporeall, i have not yet observed any place of [[scripture]], from
whence it can be gathered, that any [[man]] was ever possessed with any
other corporeal spirit, but that of his owne, by which his [[body]] is
naturally moved.




the scriptures [[scripture]] doe not [[teach]] that spirits are incorporeall

our saviour, immediately after the holy ghost descended upon him in the
form of a dove, is said by st. matthew (chapt. 4. 1.) to have been "led
up by the spirit into the wildernesse;" and the same is recited (luke 4.
1.) in these words, "jesus being full of the holy ghost, was [[led]] in
the spirit into the wildernesse;" whereby it is evident, that by
spirit there, is meant the holy ghost. this cannot be interpreted for
a possession: for [[christ]], and the holy ghost, are but one and the same
substance; which is no possession of one substance, or [[body]], by another.
and whereas in the verses following, he is said "to have been taken
up by the devill into the holy [[city]], and set upon a pinnacle of the
temple," shall we conclude thence that hee was possessed of the devill,
or carryed thither by [[violence]]? and again, "carryed thence by the devill
into an exceeding high mountain, who shewed him them thence all the
kingdomes of the [[world]]:" herein, wee are not to beleeve he was either
possessed, or forced by the devill; nor that any mountaine is high
enough, (according to the literall sense,) to shew him one whole
hemisphere. what then can be the meaning of this place, other than that
he went of himself into the wildernesse; and that this carrying of him
up and down, from the wildernesse to the [[city]], and from thence into a
mountain, was a vision? conformable whereunto, is also the phrase of st.
luke, that hee was [[led]] into the wildernesse, not by, but in the spirit:
whereas concerning his being taken up into the mountaine, and unto the
pinnacle of the temple, hee speaketh as st. matthew doth. which suiteth
with the [[nature]] of a vision.

again, where st. luke sayes of judas iscariot, that "satan entred into
him, and thereupon that he went and communed with the [[chief]] priests [[priest]], and
captaines, how he might betray [[christ]] unto them:" it may be answered,
that by the entring of [[satan]] (that is the enemy) into him, is meant, the
hostile and traiterous intention of selling his [[lord]] and master. for as
by the holy ghost, is frequently in [[scripture]] understood, the graces and
good inclinations given by the holy ghost; so by the entring of
satan, may bee understood the wicked cogitations, and designes of the
adversaries of [[christ]], and his disciples. for as it is hard to say,
that the devill was entred into judas, before he had any such hostile
designe; so it is impertinent to say, he was first christs [[enemy]] in his
heart, and that the devill entred into him afterwards. therefore the
entring of [[satan]], and his wicked [[purpose]], was one and the same thing.

but if there be no immateriall spirit, nor any possession of mens [[men]] bodies
by any spirit corporeall, it may again be [[asked]], why our saviour and his
apostles did not [[teach]] the [[people]] so; and in such cleer words, as they
might no more [[doubt]] thereof. but such questions [[question]] as these, are more
curious, than necessary for a [[christian]] mans [[man]] salvation. [[men]] may as well
aske, why [[christ]] that could have given to all [[men]] [[faith]], piety, and all
manner of morall vertues, gave it to some onely, and not to all: and
why he left the search of naturall causes, and sciences [[science]], to the naturall
reason and industry of [[men]], and did not reveal it to all, or any man
supernaturally; and many other such questions [[question]]: of which neverthelesse
there may be alledged probable and pious reasons [[reason]]. for as [[god]], when he
brought the israelites into the [[land]] of promise, did not secure them
therein, by subduing all the nations round about them; but left many of
them, as thornes in their sides, to awaken from [[time]] to [[time]] their
piety and industry: so our saviour, in conducting us toward his heavenly
kingdome, did not [[destroy]] all the difficulties of naturall questions [[question]];
but left them to exercise our industry, and [[reason]]; the scope of
his preaching, being onely to shew us this plain and direct way to
salvation, namely, the beleef of this article, "that he was the [[christ]],
the [[son]] of the living [[god]], sent into the [[world]] to [[sacrifice]] himselfe for
our sins [[sin]], and at his comming again, gloriously to reign over his elect,
and to save them from their enemies [[enemy]] eternally:" to which, the opinion
of possession by spirits, or phantasmes, are no impediment in the way;
though it be to some an [[occasion]] of going out of the way, and to follow
their own inventions. if wee require of the [[scripture]] an account of all
questions, which may be raised to trouble us in the performance of gods
commands; we may as well complaine of [[moses]] for not having set downe the
time of the creation of such spirits, as well as of the creation of the
earth, and sea, and of [[men]], and beasts. to conclude, i find in scripture
that there be angels, and spirits, [[good]] and evill; but not that they are
incorporeall, as are the apparitions [[men]] see in the dark, or in a [[dream]],
or vision; which the latines call spectra, and took for daemons. and i
find that there are spirits corporeal, (though subtile and invisible;)
but not that any mans [[man]] [[body]] was possessed, or inhabited by them; and that
the bodies [[body]] of the saints shall be such, namely, spirituall bodies [[body]], as
st. paul calls them.




the [[power]] of casting out devills, not the same it was in the primitive
church

neverthelesse, the contrary doctrine, namely, that there be incorporeall
spirits, hath hitherto so prevailed in the [[church]], that the use of
exorcisme, (that is to say, of ejection of devills by conjuration) is
thereupon built; and (though rarely and faintly practised) is not yet
totally given over. that there were many daemoniaques in the primitive
church, and few mad-men, and other such singular diseases; whereas in
these times [[time]] we hear of, and see many mad-men, and few daemoniaques,
proceeds not from the [[change]] of [[nature]]; but of names. but how it comes
to passe, that whereas heretofore the [[apostles]], and after them for a
time, the [[pastors]] of the [[church]], did cure those singular diseases, which
now they are not seen to doe; as likewise, why it is not in the [[power]] of
every true beleever now, to doe all that the faithfull did then, that is
to say, as we [[read]] (mark 16. 17.) "in christs name to cast out devills,
to speak with new tongues, to take up serpents, to drink deadly poison
without harm taking, and to cure the sick by the laying on of their
hands," and all this without other words, but "in the name of [[jesus]],"
is another [[question]]. and it is probable, that those extraordinary gifts
were given to the [[church]], for no longer a [[time]], than [[men]] trusted wholly
to [[christ]], and looked for their felicity onely in his kingdome to come;
and consequently, that when they sought [[authority]], and riches [[rich]], and
trusted to their own subtilty for a kingdome of this [[world]], these
supernaturall gifts of [[god]] were again taken from them.




another relique of gentilisme, worshipping images, left in the [[church]],
not brought into it

another relique of gentilisme, is the [[worship]] of images, neither
instituted by [[moses]] in the old, nor by [[christ]] in the new testament; nor
yet brought in from the gentiles; but left amongst them, after they had
given their names to [[christ]]. before our saviour preached, it was the
generall [[religion]] of the gentiles, to [[worship]] for gods, those apparences
that remain in the brain from the impression of externall bodies [[body]] upon
the organs of their senses, which are commonly called ideas [[idea]], idols,
phantasmes, conceits, as being representations of those externall
bodies, which cause them, and have nothing in them of reality, no more
than there is in the things that seem to stand before us in a [[dream]]:
and this is the [[reason]] why st. paul says, "wee [[know]] that an idol is
nothing:" not that he [[thought]] that an image of metall, stone, or wood,
was nothing; but that the thing which they honored, or feared in
the image, and held for a [[god]], was a meer figment, without place,
habitation, motion, or existence, but in the motions of the brain.
and the [[worship]] of these with [[divine]] [[honour]], is that which is in the
scripture called idolatry, and rebellion against [[god]]. for [[god]] being king
of the [[jews]], and his lieutenant being first [[moses]], and afterward the
high [[priest]]; if the [[people]] had been permitted to [[worship]], and [[pray]] to
images, (which are representations of their own fancies,) they had
had no farther dependence on the true [[god]], of whom there can be no
similitude; nor on his prime ministers, [[moses]], and the high priests [[priest]];
but every [[man]] had governed himself according to his own appetite, to the
utter eversion of the common-wealth, and their own destruction for want
of union. and therefore the first [[law]] of [[god]] was, "they should not take
for gods, alienos deos, that is, the gods of other nations, but that
onely true [[god]], who vouchsafed to commune with [[moses]], and by him to give
them laws [[law]] and directions, for their [[peace]], and for their salvation
from their enemies [[enemy]]." and the second was, that "they should not make to
themselves any image to [[worship]], of their own invention." for it is the
same deposing of a [[king]], to submit to another [[king]], whether he be set up
by a neighbour nation, or by our selves.




answer to [[certain]] seeming texts for images

the places of [[scripture]] pretended to countenance the setting up of
images, to [[worship]] them; or to set them up at all in the places where
god is worshipped, are first, two examples [[example]]; one of the cherubins over
the ark of [[god]]; the other of the brazen serpent: secondly, some texts
whereby we are commanded to [[worship]] [[certain]] creatures for their relation
to [[god]]; as to [[worship]] his footstool: and lastly, some other texts, by
which is authorized, a [[religious]] honoring of holy things. but before i
examine the [[force]] of those places, to prove that which is pretended, i
must first explain what is to be understood by worshipping, and what by
images, and idols.




what is worship

i have already shewn in the 20 [[chapter]] of this discourse, that to [[honor]],
is to value highly the [[power]] of any [[person]]: and that such value is
measured, by our comparing him with others. but because there is nothing
to be compared with [[god]] in [[power]]; we [[honor]] him not but dishonour him
by any value lesse than infinite. and thus [[honor]] is properly of its own
nature, secret, and internall in the [[heart]]. but the inward thoughts [[thought]] of
men, which appeare outwardly in their words and actions, are the signes
of our honoring, and these goe by the name of [[worship]], in latine,
cultus. therefore, to [[pray]] to, to swear by, to obey, to bee diligent,
and officious in serving: in summe, all words and actions that betoken
fear to offend, or [[desire]] to please, is [[worship]], whether those words
and actions be sincere, or feigned: and because they appear as signes of
honoring, are ordinarily also called [[honor]].




distinction between [[divine]] and civill worship

the [[worship]] we exhibite to those we esteem to be but [[men]], as to kings [[king]],
and [[men]] in [[authority]], is civill [[worship]]: but the [[worship]] we exhibite
to that which we [[think]] to bee [[god]], whatsoever the words, ceremonies [[ceremony]],
gestures, or other actions be, is [[divine]] [[worship]]. to fall prostrate
before a [[king]], in him that thinks [[think]] him but a [[man]], is but civill [[worship]]:
and he that but putteth off his hat in the [[church]], for this cause, that
he thinketh it the house of [[god]], worshippeth with [[divine]] [[worship]]. they
that seek the distinction of [[divine]] and civill [[worship]], not in the
intention of the worshipper, but in the words douleia, and latreia,
deceive themselves. for whereas there be two sorts of servants; that
sort, which is of those that are absolutely in the [[power]] of their
masters, as slaves [[slave]] taken in [[war]], and their issue, whose bodies [[body]] are not
in their own [[power]], (their lives [[life]] depending on the will of their masters,
in such manner as to forfeit them upon the least disobedience,) and that
are bought and sold as beasts, were called douloi, that is properly,
slaves, and their service, douleia: the other, which is of those that
serve (for hire, or in [[hope]] of benefit from their masters) voluntarily;
are called thetes; that is, domestique servants; to whose service the
masters have no further [[right]], than is contained in the covenants made
betwixt them. these two kinds [[kind]] of servants have thus much [[common]] to them
both, that their [[labour]] is appointed them by another, whether, as a
slave, or a voluntary servant: and the word latris, is the general name
of both, signifying him that worketh for another, whether, as a [[slave]],
or a voluntary servant: so that latreia signifieth generally all
service; but douleia the service of bondmen onely, and the condition of
slavery: and both are used in [[scripture]] (to signifie our service of god)
promiscuously. douleia, because we are gods slaves [[slave]]; latreia, because
wee serve him: and in all kinds [[kind]] of service is contained, not onely
obedience, but also [[worship]], that is, such actions, gestures, and words,
as signifie [[honor]].




an image what phantasmes

an image (in the most strict signification of the word) is the
resemblance of some thing visible: in which sense the phantasticall
formes, apparitions, or seemings of visible bodies [[body]] to the sight, are
onely images; such as are the shew of a [[man]], or other thing in the
water, by reflexion, or refraction; or of the sun, or stars by direct
vision in the air; which are nothing reall in the things seen, nor in
the place where thy seem to bee; nor are their magnitudes and figures
the same with that of the object; but changeable, by the variation of
the organs of sight, or by glasses; and are [[present]] oftentimes in our
imagination, and in our dreams [[dream]], when the object is absent; or changed
into other colours, and shapes, as things that depend onely upon the
fancy. and these are the images which are originally and most properly
called ideas [[idea]], and idols, and derived from the [[language]] of the graecians,
with whom the word eido signifieth to see. they are also called
phantasmes, which is in the same [[language]], apparitions. and from these
images it is that one of the faculties of mans [[man]] [[nature]], is called the
imagination. and from hence it is manifest, that there neither is, nor
can bee any image made of a thing invisible.

it is also evident, that there can be no image of a thing infinite: for
all the images, and phantasmes that are made by the impression of things
visible, are figured: but figure is a quantity every way determined: and
therefore there can bee no image of [[god]]: nor of the soule of [[man]]; nor of
spirits, but onely of bodies [[body]] visible, that is, bodies [[body]] that have [[light]] in
themselves, or are by such enlightened.




fictions; materiall images

and whereas a [[man]] can fancy shapes he never saw; making up a figure out
of the parts of divers creatures; as the poets make their centaures,
chimaeras, and other monsters never seen: so can he also give matter to
those shapes, and make them in wood, clay or metall. and these are also
called images, not for the resemblance of any corporeall thing, but for
the resemblance of some phantasticall inhabitants of the brain of the
maker. but in these idols, as they are originally in the brain, and
as they are painted, carved, moulded, or moulten in matter, there is a
similitude of the one to the other, for which the materiall [[body]] made
by art [[arts]], may be said to be the image of the phantasticall idoll made by
nature.

but in a larger use of the word image, is contained also, any
representation of one thing by another. so an earthly soveraign may be
called the image of [[god]]: and an inferiour magistrate the image of an
earthly soveraign. and many times [[time]] in the idolatry of the gentiles there
was little regard to the similitude of their materiall idoll to the
idol in their fancy, and yet it was called the image of it. for a
stone unhewn has been set up for [[neptune]], and divers other shapes far
different from the shapes they conceived of their gods. and at this
day we see many images of the virgin [[mary]], and other saints, unlike one
another, and without correspondence to any one mans [[man]] fancy; and yet serve
well enough for the [[purpose]] they were erected for; which was no more but
by the names onely, to represent the persons [[person]] mentioned in the [[history]];
to which every [[man]] applyeth a mentall image of his owne making, or
none at all. and thus an image in the largest sense, is either the
resemblance, or the representation of some thing visible; or both
together, as it happeneth for the most part.

but the name of idoll is extended yet further in [[scripture]], to
signifie also the sunne, or a starre, or any other creature, visible or
invisible, when they are worshipped for gods.




idolatry what

having shewn what is [[worship]], and what an image; i will now put them
together, and examine what that idolatry is, which is forbidden in the
second commandement, and other places of the [[scripture]].

to [[worship]] an image, is voluntarily to doe those externall acts, which
are signes of honoring either the matter of the image, which is wood,
stone, or metall, or some other visible creature; or the phantasme of
the brain, for the resemblance, or representation whereof, the matter
was formed and figured; or both together, as one animate [[body]], composed
of the matter and the phantasme, as of a [[body]] and soule.

to be uncovered, before a [[man]] of [[power]] and [[authority]], or before the
throne of a [[prince]], or in such other places as hee ordaineth to that
purpose in his absence, is to [[worship]] that [[man]], or [[prince]] with civill
worship; as being a signe, not of honoring the stoole, or place, but the
person; and is not idolatry. but if hee that doth it, should suppose the
soule of the [[prince]] to be in the stool, or should [[present]] a petition to
the stool, it were [[divine]] [[worship]], and idolatry.

to [[pray]] to a [[king]] for such things, as hee is able to doe for us, though
we prostrate our selves before him, is but civill [[worship]]; because we
acknowledge no other [[power]] in him, but humane: but voluntarily to pray
unto him for [[fair]] weather, or for any thing which [[god]] onely can doe
for us, is [[divine]] [[worship]], and idolatry. on the other side, if a king
compell a [[man]] to it by the terrour of [[death]], or other [[great]] corporall
punishment, it is not idolatry: for the [[worship]] which the soveraign
commandeth to bee done unto himself by the terrour of his laws [[law]], is not
a sign that he that obeyeth him, does inwardly [[honour]] him as a [[god]], but
that he is desirous to save himselfe from [[death]], or from a miserable
life; and that which is not a sign of internall [[honor]], is no [[worship]];
and therefore no idolatry. neither can it bee said, that hee that does
it, scandalizeth, or layeth any stumbling block before his [[brother]];
because how [[wise]], or learned soever he be that worshippeth in that
manner, another [[man]] cannot from thence argue, that he approveth it; but
that he doth it for [[fear]]; and that it is not his act, but the act of the
soveraign.

to [[worship]] [[god]], in some peculiar place, or turning a mans [[man]] face towards
an image, or determinate place, is not to [[worship]], or [[honor]] the place,
or image; but to acknowledge it holy, that is to say, to acknowledge
the image, or the place to be set apart from [[common]] use: for that is the
meaning of the word holy; which implies no new quality in the place, or
image; but onely a new relation by appropriation to [[god]]; and therefore
is not idolatry; no more than it was idolatry to [[worship]] [[god]] before
the brazen serpent; or for the [[jews]] when they were out of their owne
countrey, to turn their faces (when they prayed) toward the temple of
jerusalem; or for [[moses]] to put off his shoes when he was before the
flaming bush, the ground appertaining to mount sinai; which place god
had chosen to appear in, and to give his laws [[law]] to the [[people]] of [[israel]],
and was therefore holy ground, not by inhaerent [[sanctity]], but by
separation to gods use; or for christians [[christian]] to [[worship]] in the churches [[church]],
which are once solemnly dedicated to [[god]] for that [[purpose]], by the
authority of the [[king]], or other true representant of the [[church]]. but to
worship [[god]], is inanimating, or inhibiting, such image, or place; that
is to say, an infinite substance in a finite place, is idolatry: for
such finite gods, are but idols of the brain, nothing reall; and are
commonly called in the [[scripture]] by the names of vanity, and lyes, and
nothing. also to [[worship]] [[god]], not as inanimating, or [[present]] in the
place, or image; but to the end to be put in [[mind]] of him, or of some
works of his, in case the place, or image be dedicated, or set up
by private [[authority]], and not by the [[authority]] of them that are our
soveraign [[pastors]], is idolatry. for the commandement is, "thou shalt not
make to thy selfe any graven image." [[god]] commanded [[moses]] to set up the
brazen serpent; hee did not make it to himselfe; it was not therefore
against the commandement. but the making of the golden calfe by aaron,
and the [[people]], as being done without [[authority]] from [[god]], was idolatry;
not onely because they held it for [[god]], but also because they made it
for a [[religious]] use, without warrant either from [[god]] their soveraign, or
from [[moses]], that was his lieutenant.

the gentiles worshipped for gods, [[jupiter]], and others; that living, were
men perhaps that had done [[great]] and glorious acts; and for the children
of [[god]], divers [[men]] and [[women]], supposing them gotten between an immortall
deity, and a mortall [[man]]. this was idolatry, because they made them so
to themselves, having no [[authority]] from [[god]], neither in his eternall law
of [[reason]], nor in his positive and revealed will. but though our saviour
was a [[man]], whom wee also beleeve to bee [[god]] immortall, and the [[son]] of
god; yet this is no idolatry; because wee build not that beleef upon
our own fancy, or [[judgment]], but upon the word of [[god]] revealed in the
scriptures. and for the adoration of the eucharist, if the words of
christ, "this is my [[body]]," signifie, "that he himselfe, and the seeming
bread in his hand; and not onely so, but that all the seeming morsells
of bread that have ever since been, and any [[time]] hereafter shall bee
consecrated by priests [[priest]], bee so many christs bodies [[body]], and yet all of them
but one [[body]]," then is that no idolatry, because it is authorized by our
saviour: but if that text doe not signifie that, (for there is no other
that can be alledged for it,) then, because it is a [[worship]] of humane
institution, it is idolatry. for it is not enough to say, [[god]] can
transubstantiate the bread into christs [[body]]: for the gentiles also held
god to be omnipotent; and might upon that ground no lesse excuse their
idolatry, by pretending, as well as others, as transubstantiation of
their wood, and stone into [[god]] almighty.

whereas there be, that pretend [[divine]] inspiration, to be a supernaturall
entring of the holy ghost into a [[man]], and not an acquisition of gods
grace, by doctrine, and study; i [[think]] they are in a very dangerous
dilemma. for if they [[worship]] not the [[men]] whom they beleeve to be so
inspired, they fall into impiety; as not adoring gods supernaturall
presence. and again, if they [[worship]] them, they commit idolatry; for the
apostles would never permit themselves to be so worshipped. therefore
the safest way is to beleeve, that by the descending of the dove upon
the [[apostles]]; and by christs breathing on them, when hee gave them
the holy ghost; and by the giving of it by imposition of hands, are
understood the signes which [[god]] hath been pleased to use, or ordain to
be used, of his promise to assist those persons [[person]] in their study to
preach his kingdome, and in their conversation, that it might not be
scandalous, but edifying to others.




scandalous [[worship]] of images

besides the idolatrous [[worship]] of images, there is also a scandalous
worship of them; which is also a [[sin]]; but not idolatry. for idolatry is
to [[worship]] by signes of an internall, and reall [[honour]]: but scandalous
worship, is but seeming [[worship]]; and may sometimes bee joined with
an inward, and hearty detestation, both of the image, and of the
phantasticall daemon, or idol, to which it is dedicated; and proceed
onely from the [[fear]] of [[death]], or other grievous [[punishment]]; and is
neverthelesse a [[sin]] in them that so [[worship]], in case they be [[men]] whose
actions are looked at by others, as lights [[light]] to guide them by; because
following their ways, they cannot but stumble, and fall in the way of
religion: whereas the [[example]] of those we regard not, works [[work]] not on us
at all, but leaves us to our own diligence and caution; and consequently
are no causes of our falling.

if therefore a pastor lawfully called to [[teach]] and direct others, or any
other, of whose [[knowledge]] there is a [[great]] [[opinion]], doe externall honor
to an idol for [[fear]]; unlesse he make his feare, and unwillingnesse to
it, as evident as the [[worship]]; he scandalizeth his [[brother]], by seeming
to approve idolatry. for his [[brother]], arguing from the action of his
teacher, or of him whose [[knowledge]] he esteemeth [[great]], concludes it
to bee lawfull in it selfe. and this scandall, is [[sin]], and a scandall
given. but if one being no pastor, nor of eminent [[reputation]] for
knowledge in [[christian]] doctrine, doe the same, and another [[follow]] him;
this is no scandall given; for he had no cause to [[follow]] such [[example]]:
but is a pretence of scandall which hee taketh of himselfe for an excuse
before [[men]]: for an unlearned [[man]], that is in the [[power]] of an idolatrous
king, or [[state]], if commanded on [[pain]] of [[death]] to [[worship]] before an
idoll, hee detesteth the idoll in his [[heart]], hee doth well; though if he
had the fortitude to suffer [[death]], rather than [[worship]] it, he should
doe [[better]]. but if a pastor, who as christs messenger, has undertaken to
teach christs doctrine to all nations, should doe the same, it were
not onely a sinfull scandall, in [[respect]] of other [[christian]] mens
consciences, but a perfidious forsaking of his charge.

the summe of that which i have said hitherto, concerning the [[worship]] of
images, is that, that he that worshippeth in an image, or any creature,
either the matter thereof, or any fancy of his own, which he thinketh
to dwell in it; or both together; or beleeveth that such things hear
his prayers, or see his devotions, without ears, or [[eyes]], committeth
idolatry: and he that counterfeiteth such [[worship]] for [[fear]] of
punishment, if he bee a [[man]] whose [[example]] hath [[power]] amongst his
brethren, committeth a [[sin]]: but he that worshippeth the creator of the
world before such an image, or in such a place as he hath not made, or
chosen of himselfe, but taken from the commandement of gods word, as the
jewes did in worshipping [[god]] before the cherubins, and before the brazen
serpent for a [[time]], and in, or towards the temple of [[jerusalem]], which
was also but for a [[time]], committeth not idolatry.

now for the [[worship]] of saints, and images, and reliques, and other
things at this day practised in the [[church]] of [[rome]], i say they are not
allowed by the word of [[god]], not brought into the [[church]] of [[rome]], from
the doctrine there taught; but partly left in it at the first conversion
of the gentiles; and afterwards countenanced, and confirmed, and
augmented by the bishops of [[rome]].




answer to the argument from the cherubins, and brazen serpent

as for the proofs alledged out of [[scripture]], namely, those examples
of images appointed by [[god]] to bee set up; they were not set up for the
people, or any [[man]] to [[worship]]; but that they should [[worship]] [[god]] himselfe
before them: as before the cherubins over the ark, and the brazen
serpent. for we [[read]] not, that the [[priest]], or any other did [[worship]] the
cherubins; but contrarily wee [[read]] (2 kings [[king]] 18.4.) that hezekiah brake
in pieces the brazen serpent which [[moses]] had set up, because the
people burnt incense to it. besides, those examples [[example]] are not put for
our imitation, that we also should set up images, under pretence
of worshipping [[god]] before them; because the words of the second
commandement, "thou shalt not make to thy selfe any graven image, &c."
distinguish between the images that [[god]] commanded to be set up, and
those which wee set up to our selves. and therefore from the cherubins,
or brazen serpent, to the images of mans [[man]] devising; and from the worship
commanded by [[god]], to the will-worship of [[men]], the argument is not [[good]].
this also is to bee considered, that as hezekiah brake in pieces the
brazen serpent, because the [[jews]] did [[worship]] it, to the end they should
doe so no more; so also [[christian]] soveraigns ought to break down the
images which their subjects [[subject]] have been accustomed to [[worship]]; that there
be no more [[occasion]] of such idolatry. for at this day, the ignorant
people, where images are worshipped, doe really beleeve there is a
divine [[power]] in the images; and are told by their [[pastors]], that some
of them have spoken; and have bled; and that [[miracles]] have been done by
them; which they apprehend as done by the saint, which they [[think]] either
is the image it [[self]], or in it. the israelites, when they worshipped the
calfe, did [[think]] they worshipped the [[god]] that brought them out of [[egypt]];
and yet it was idolatry, because they [[thought]] the calfe either was
that [[god]], or had him in his belly. and though some [[man]] may [[think]] it
impossible for [[people]] to be so stupid, as to [[think]] the image to be
god, or a saint; or to [[worship]] it in that notion; yet it is manifest
in [[scripture]] to the contrary; where when the golden calfe was made, the
people said, (exod. 32. 2.) "these are thy gods o [[israel]];" and where the
images of laban (gen. 31.30.) are called his gods. and wee see daily by
experience in all sorts of [[people]], that such [[men]] as study nothing but
their food and ease, are content to beleeve any absurdity, rather than
to trouble themselves to examine it; holding their [[faith]] as it were by
entaile unalienable, except by an expresse and new [[law]].




painting of fancies no idolatry: abusing them to [[religious]] [[worship]] is

but they inferre from some other places, that it is lawfull to paint
angels, and also [[god]] himselfe: as from gods walking in the garden; from
jacobs seeing [[god]] at the top of the ladder; and from other visions, and
dreams. but visions, and dreams [[dream]] whether naturall, or supernaturall, are
but phantasmes: and he that painteth an image of any of them, maketh not
an image of [[god]], but of his own phantasm, which is, making of an idol. i
say not, that to draw a picture after a fancy, is a [[sin]]; but when it
is drawn, to hold it for a representation of [[god]], is against the second
commandement; and can be of no use, but to [[worship]]. and the same may be
said of the images of angels, and of [[men]] [[dead]]; unlesse as monuments of
friends, or of [[men]] worthy remembrance: for such use of an image, is not
worship of the image; but a civill honoring of the [[person]], not that is,
but that was: but when it is done to the image which we make of a saint,
for no other [[reason]], but that we [[think]] he heareth our prayers, and is
pleased with the [[honour]] wee doe him, when [[dead]], and without sense, wee
attribute to him more than humane [[power]]; and therefore it is idolatry.

seeing therefore there is no [[authority]], neither in the [[law]] of [[moses]],
nor in the gospel, for the [[religious]] [[worship]] of images, or other
representations of [[god]], which [[men]] set up to themselves; or for the
worship of the image of any creature in [[heaven]], or [[earth]], or under the
earth: and whereas [[christian]] kings [[king]], who are living representants of [[god]],
are not to be worshipped by their subjects [[subject]], by any act, that signifieth
a greater esteem of his [[power]], than the [[nature]] of mortall [[man]] is capable
of; it cannot be imagined, that the [[religious]] [[worship]] now in use,
was brought into the [[church]], by misunderstanding of the [[scripture]]. it
resteth therefore, that it was left in it, by not destroying the images
themselves, in the conversion of the gentiles that worshipped them.




how idolatry was left in the church

the cause whereof, was the immoderate esteem, and prices set upon the
workmanship of them, which made the owners (though converted, from
worshipping them as they had done religiously for daemons) to retain
them still in their houses, upon pretence of doing it in the [[honor]] of
christ, of the virgin [[mary]], and of the [[apostles]], and other the pastors
of the primitive [[church]]; as being easie, by giving them new names, to
make that an image of the virgin [[mary]], and of her sonne our saviour,
which before perhaps was called the image of [[venus]], and cupid; and so of
a [[jupiter]] to make a barnabas, and of mercury a paul, and the like. and
as worldly [[ambition]] creeping by degrees [[degree]] into the [[pastors]], drew them to
an endeavour of pleasing the new made christians [[christian]]; and also to a liking
of this [[kind]] of [[honour]], which they also might [[hope]] for after their
decease, as well as those that had already gained it: so the worshipping
of the images of [[christ]] and his [[apostles]], grow more and more idolatrous;
save that somewhat after the [[time]] of constantine, divers emperors [[emperor]], and
bishops, and generall councells observed, and opposed the unlawfulnesse
thereof; but too late, or too weakly.




canonizing of saints

the canonizing of saints, is another relique of gentilisme: it is
neither a misunderstanding of [[scripture]], nor a new invention of the
roman [[church]], but a custome as ancient as the common-wealth of [[rome]] it
self. the first that ever was canonized at [[rome]], was romulus, and that
upon the narration of julius proculus, that swore before the senate,
he spake with him after his [[death]], and was assured by him, he dwelt in
heaven, and was there called quirinius, and would be propitious to
the [[state]] of their new [[city]]: and thereupon the senate gave publique
testimony of his [[sanctity]]. julius caesar, and other emperors [[emperor]] after him,
had the like testimony; that is, were canonized for saints; now defined;
and is the same with the apotheosis of the heathen.




the name of pontifex

it is also from the roman heathen, that the popes have received the
name, and [[power]] of pontifex maximus. this was the name of him that in
the ancient common-wealth of [[rome]], had the supreme [[authority]] under
the senate and [[people]], of regulating all ceremonies [[ceremony]], and doctrines
concerning their [[religion]]: and when augustus caesar changed the state
into a [[monarchy]], he took to himselfe no more but this office, and that
of tribune of the [[people]], (than is to say, the supreme [[power]] both in
state, and [[religion]];) and the succeeding emperors [[emperor]] enjoyed the same. but
when the emperour constantine lived, who was the first that professed
and authorized [[christian]] [[religion]], it was consonant to his profession,
to cause [[religion]] to be regulated (under his authority) by the bishop
of [[rome]]: though it doe not appear they had so soon the name of pontifex;
but rather, that the succeeding bishops took it of themselves, to
countenance the [[power]] they exercised over the bishops of the roman
provinces. for it is not any priviledge of st. peter, but the priviledge
of the [[city]] of [[rome]], which the emperors [[emperor]] were alwaies willing to uphold;
that gave them such [[authority]] over other bishops; as may be evidently
seen by that, that the bishop of constantinople, when the emperour made
that [[city]] the seat of the [[empire]], pretended to bee equall to the bishop
of [[rome]]; though at [[last]], not without contention, the [[pope]] carryed it,
and became the pontifex maximus; but in [[right]] onely of the emperour; and
not without the bounds of the [[empire]]; nor any where, after the emperour
had lost his [[power]] in [[rome]]; though it were the [[pope]] himself that took
his [[power]] from him. from whence wee may by the way observe, that there
is no place for the superiority of the [[pope]] over other bishops, except
in the territories whereof he is himself the civill soveraign; and where
the emperour having soveraign [[power]] civill, hath expressely chosen the
pope for the [[chief]] pastor under himselfe, of his [[christian]] subjects [[subject]].




procession of images

the carrying about of images in procession, is another relique of the
religion of the greeks [[greek]], and romans: for they also carried their
idols from place to place, in a [[kind]] of chariot, which was peculiarly
dedicated to that use, which the latines called thensa, and vehiculum
deorum; and the image was placed in a frame, or shrine, which they
called ferculum: and that which they called pompa, is the same that
now is named procession: according whereunto, amongst the [[divine]] honors
which were given to julius caesar by the senate, this was one, that in
the pompe (or procession) at the circaean games, he should have thensam
& ferculum, a [[sacred]] chariot, and a shrine; which was as much, as to be
carried up and down as a [[god]]: just as at this day the popes are carried
by switzers under a canopie.




wax candles, and torches lighted

to these processions also belonged the bearing of burning torches, and
candles, before the images of the gods, both amongst the greeks [[greek]], and
romans. for afterwards the emperors [[emperor]] of [[rome]] received the same [[honor]]; as
we [[read]] of caligula, that at his reception to the [[empire]], he was carried
from misenum to [[rome]], in the midst of a throng of [[people]], the wayes
beset with altars, and beasts for [[sacrifice]], and burning torches: and
of caracalla that was received into alexandria with incense, and with
casting of flowers, and dadouchiais, that is, with torches; for dadochoi
were they that amongst the greeks [[greek]] carried torches lighted in the
processions of their gods: and in processe of [[time]], the devout, but
ignorant [[people]], did many times [[time]] [[honor]] their bishops with the like
pompe of wax candles, and the images of our saviour, and the saints,
constantly, in the [[church]] it [[self]]. and thus came in the use of wax
candles; and was also established by some of the ancient councells.

the heathens had also their aqua lustralis, that is to say, holy water.
the [[church]] of [[rome]] imitates them also in their holy dayes. they had
their bacchanalia; and we have our wakes, answering to them: they
their saturnalia, and we our carnevalls, and shrove-tuesdays liberty
of servants: they their procession of priapus; wee our fetching in,
erection, and dancing about may-poles; and dancing is one [[kind]] of
worship: they had their procession called ambarvalia; and we our
procession about the fields in the rogation week. nor do i [[think]] that
these are all the ceremonies [[ceremony]] that have been left in the [[church]], from the
first conversion of the gentiles: but they are all that i can for the
present call to [[mind]]; and if a [[man]] would wel observe that which is
delivered in the histories [[history]], concerning the [[religious]] rites of the greeks
and romanes, i [[doubt]] not but he might find many more of these old empty
bottles of gentilisme, which the doctors of the romane [[church]], either
by negligence, or [[ambition]], have filled up again with the new wine of
christianity, that will not faile in [[time]] to break them.



chapter xlvi. of darknesse from [[vain]] [[philosophy]], and fabulous traditions




what [[philosophy]] is

by [[philosophy]] is understood "the [[knowledge]] acquired by reasoning, from
the manner of the [[generation]] of any thing, to the properties [[property]]; or from
the properties [[property]], to some possible way of [[generation]] of the same; to the
end to bee able to [[produce]], as far as matter, and humane [[force]] permit,
such effects, as humane [[life]] requireth." so the geometrician, from the
construction of figures, findeth out many properties [[property]] thereof; and from
the properties [[property]], new ways of their construction, by reasoning; to the end
to be able to measure [[land]] and water; and for infinite other uses. so
the astronomer, from the rising, setting, and moving of the sun, and
starres, in divers parts of the heavens [[heaven]], findeth out the causes of day,
and night, and of the different seasons of the year; whereby he keepeth
an account of [[time]]: and the like of other sciences [[science]].




prudence no part of philosophy

by which definition it is evident, that we are not to account as any
part thereof, that originall [[knowledge]] called [[experience]], in which
consisteth prudence: because it is not attained by reasoning, but found
as well in brute beasts, as in [[man]]; and is but a memory of successions
of events in times [[time]] [[past]], wherein the omission of every little
circumstance altering the effect, frustrateth the expectation of the
most prudent: whereas nothing is produced by reasoning aright, but
generall, eternall, and immutable [[truth]].




no false doctrine is part of philosophy

nor are we therefore to give that name to any false conclusions: for he
that reasoneth aright in words he understandeth, can never conclude an
error:



no more is revelation supernaturall

nor to that which any [[man]] knows [[know]] by supernaturall revelation; because it
is not acquired by reasoning:




nor learning taken upon credit of authors

nor that which is gotten by reasoning from the [[authority]] of books [[book]];
because it is not by reasoning from the cause to the effect, nor from
the effect to the cause; and is not [[knowledge]], but [[faith]].




of the beginnings and progresse of philosophy

the faculty of reasoning being consequent to the use of [[speech]], it was
not possible, but that there should have been some generall truthes
found out by reasoning, as ancient almost as [[language]] it selfe. the
savages of [[america]], are not without some [[good]] morall sentences; also
they have a little arithmetick, to adde, and divide in numbers not too
great: but they are not therefore [[philosophers]]. for as there were plants
of corn and wine in small quantity dispersed in the fields and woods,
before [[men]] knew their vertue, or made use of them for their nourishment,
or planted them apart in fields, and vineyards; in which [[time]] they
fed on akorns, and drank water: so also there have been divers true,
generall, and profitable speculations from the beginning; as being the
naturall plants of humane [[reason]]: but they were at first but few in
number; [[men]] lived upon grosse [[experience]]; there was no method; that is
to say, no sowing, nor planting of [[knowledge]] by it [[self]], apart from the
weeds, and [[common]] plants of errour and conjecture: and the cause of it
being the want of leasure from procuring the necessities of [[life]], and
defending themselves against their neighbours, it was impossible, till
the erecting of [[great]] common-wealths, it should be otherwise. leasure
is the [[mother]] of [[philosophy]]; and common-wealth, the [[mother]] of [[peace]], and
leasure: where first were [[great]] and flourishing cities [[city]], there was first
the study of [[philosophy]]. the gymnosophists of [[india]], the magi of [[persia]],
and the priests [[priest]] of chaldea and [[egypt]], are counted the most ancient
philosophers; and those countreys were the most ancient of kingdomes.
philosophy was not risen to the graecians, and other [[people]] of the west,
whose common-wealths (no greater perhaps then lucca, or geneva) had
never [[peace]], but when their fears [[fear]] of one another were equall; nor the
leasure to observe any thing but one another. at length, when warre had
united many of these graecian lesser cities [[city]], into fewer, and greater;
then began seven [[men]], of severall parts of greece, to get the reputation
of being [[wise]]; some of them for morall and politique sentences; and
others for the learning of the chaldeans and [[egyptians]], which was
astronomy, and geometry. but we hear not yet of any schools of
philosophy.




of the schools of [[philosophy]] amongst the athenians

after the athenians by the overthrow of the persian armies [[army]], had gotten
the dominion of the sea; and thereby, of all the islands, and maritime
cities of the archipelago, as well of [[asia]] as [[europe]]; and were grown
wealthy; they that had no employment, neither at [[home]], nor abroad, had
little else to employ themselves in, but either (as st. luke says, acts
17.21.) "in telling and hearing news," or in discoursing of philosophy
publiquely to the [[youth]] of the [[city]]. every master took some place for
that [[purpose]]. [[plato]] in certaine publique walks called academia, from one
academus: [[aristotle]] in the walk of the temple of pan, called lycaeum:
others in the stoa, or covered walk, wherein the merchants goods [[good]] were
brought to [[land]]: others in other places; where they spent the [[time]] of
their leasure, in teaching or in disputing of their opinions [[opinion]]: and some
in any place, where they could get the [[youth]] of the [[city]] together to
hear them talk. and this was it which carneades also did at [[rome]], when
he was ambassadour: which caused cato to advise the senate to dispatch
him quickly, for feare of corrupting the manners of the [[young]] [[men]] that
delighted to hear him speak (as they thought) fine things.

from this it was, that the place where any of them taught, and disputed,
was called schola, which in their tongue signifieth leasure; and their
disputations, diatribae, that is to say, passing of the [[time]]. also the
philosophers themselves had the name of their sects, some of them from
these their schools: for they that followed plato’s doctrine, were
called academiques; the followers of [[aristotle]], peripatetiques, from the
walk hee taught in; and those that zeno taught, stoiques, from the stoa:
as if we should denominate [[men]] from more-fields, from pauls-church, and
from the exchange, because they meet there often, to prate and loyter.

neverthelesse, [[men]] were so much taken with this custome, that in time
it spread it selfe over all [[europe]], and the [[best]] part of afrique; so as
there were schools publiquely erected, and maintained for lectures, and
disputations, almost in every common-wealth.




of the schools of the jews

there were also schools, anciently, both before, and after the [[time]] of
our saviour, amongst the [[jews]]: but they were schools of their [[law]]. for
though they were called synagogues, that is to say, congregations of the
people; yet in as much as the [[law]] was every [[sabbath]] day [[read]], expounded,
and disputed in them, they differed not in [[nature]], but in name onely
from publique schools; and were not onely in [[jerusalem]], but in every
city of the gentiles, where the [[jews]] inhabited. there was such a schoole
at damascus, whereinto paul entred, to [[persecute]]. there were others at
antioch, iconium and thessalonica, whereinto he entred, to dispute:
and such was the synagogue of the libertines, cyrenians, alexandrians,
cilicians, and those of [[asia]]; that is to say, the schoole of libertines,
and of jewes, that were strangers in [[jerusalem]]: and of this schoole they
were that disputed with saint steven.




the schoole of graecians unprofitable

but what has been the utility of those schools? what [[science]] is there
at this day acquired by their readings and disputings? that wee have
of geometry, which is the [[mother]] of all naturall [[science]], wee are not
indebted for it to the schools. [[plato]] that was the [[best]] philosopher
of the greeks [[greek]], forbad entrance into his schoole, to all that were not
already in some measure geometricians. there were many that [[studied]] that
science to the [[great]] advantage of [[mankind]]: but there is no mention of
their schools; nor was there any sect of geometricians; nor did they
then passe under the name of [[philosophers]]. the naturall philosophy
of those schools, was rather a [[dream]] than [[science]], and set forth in
senselesse and insignificant [[language]]; which cannot be avoided by
those that will [[teach]] [[philosophy]], without having first attained great
knowledge in geometry: for [[nature]] worketh by motion; the wayes,
and degrees [[degree]] whereof cannot be known, without the [[knowledge]] of the
proportions and properties [[property]] of lines, and figures. their morall
philosophy is but a description of their own [[passions]]. for the [[rule]] of
manners, without civill [[government]], is the [[law]] of [[nature]]; and in it,
the [[law]] civill; that determineth what is honest, and dishonest; what is
just, and [[unjust]]; and generally what is [[good]], and evill: whereas they
make the rules [[rule]] of [[good]], and [[bad]], by their own liking, and disliking: by
which means, in so [[great]] [[diversity]] of taste, there is nothing generally
agreed on; but every one doth (as far as he dares) whatsoever seemeth
good in his own [[eyes]], to the subversion of common-wealth. their logique
which should bee the method of reasoning, is nothing else but captions
of words, and inventions how to puzzle such as should goe about to pose
them. to conclude there is nothing so absurd, that the old philosophers
(as cicero saith, who was one of them) have not some of them maintained.
and i beleeve that scarce any thing can be more absurdly said
in naturall [[philosophy]], than that which now is called aristotles
metaphysiques, nor more repugnant to [[government]], than much of that hee
hath said in his politiques; nor more ignorantly, than a [[great]] part of
his ethiques.




the schools of the [[jews]] unprofitable

the schoole of the [[jews]], was originally a schoole of the [[law]] of [[moses]];
who commanded (deut. 31.10.) that at the end of every seventh year, at
the feast of the tabernacles, it should be [[read]] to all the [[people]], that
they might hear, and learn it: therefore the reading of the [[law]] (which
was in use after the captivity) every [[sabbath]] day, ought to have had
no other end, but the acquainting of the [[people]] with the commandements
which they were to obey, and to expound unto them the writings of the
prophets. but it is manifest, by the many reprehensions of them by
our saviour, that they corrupted the text of the [[law]] with their
false commentaries, and [[vain]] traditions; and so little understood the
prophets, that they did neither acknowledge [[christ]], nor the works [[work]] he
did; for which the prophets [[prophet]] prophecyed. so that by their lectures and
disputations in their synagogues, they turned the doctrine of their law
into a phantasticall [[kind]] of [[philosophy]], concerning the incomprehensible
nature of [[god]], and of spirits; which they compounded of the vain
philosophy and theology of the graecians, mingled with their own
fancies, drawn from the obscurer places of the [[scripture]], and which
might most easily bee wrested to their [[purpose]]; and from the fabulous
traditions of their [[ancestors]].




university what it is

that which is now called an [[university]], is a joyning together, and an
incorporation under one [[government]] of many publique schools, in one and
the same town or [[city]]. in which, the principal schools were ordained for
the three professions, that is to say, of the romane [[religion]], of the
romane [[law]], and of the art [[arts]] of medicine. and for the study of philosophy
it hath no otherwise place, then as a handmaid to the romane [[religion]]:
and since the [[authority]] of [[aristotle]] is onely current there, that
study is not properly [[philosophy]], (the [[nature]] whereof dependeth not on
authors,) but aristotelity. and for geometry, till of very late times [[time]] it
had no place at all; as being subservient to nothing but rigide [[truth]].
and if any [[man]] by the ingenuity of his owne [[nature]], had attained to any
degree of [[perfection]] therein, hee was commonly [[thought]] a magician, and
his art [[arts]] diabolicall.




errors brought into [[religion]] from aristotles metaphysiques

now to descend to the particular tenets of [[vain]] [[philosophy]], derived to
the universities [[university]], and thence into the [[church]], partly from [[aristotle]],
partly from blindnesse of understanding; i shall first consider their
principles. there is a [[certain]] philosophia prima, on which all other
philosophy ought to depend; and consisteth principally, in right
limiting of the significations of such appellations, or names, as are
of all others the most universall: which limitations serve to avoid
ambiguity, and aequivocation in reasoning; and are commonly called
definitions; such as are the definitions of [[body]], [[time]], place, matter,
forme, essence, [[subject]], substance, accident, [[power]], act, finite,
infinite, quantity, quality, motion, action, passion, and divers others,
necessary to the explaining of a mans [[man]] conceptions concerning the nature
and [[generation]] of bodies [[body]]. the explication (that is, the setling of the
meaning) of which, and the like terms, is commonly in the schools called
metaphysiques; as being a part of the [[philosophy]] of [[aristotle]], which
hath that for title: but it is in another sense; for there it signifieth
as much, as "books written, or placed after his naturall [[philosophy]]:"
but the schools take them for books [[book]] of supernaturall [[philosophy]]: for the
word metaphysiques will bear both these senses. and indeed that which is
there written, is for the most part so far from the possibility of being
understood, and so repugnant to naturall [[reason]], that whosoever
thinketh there is any thing to bee understood by it, must needs [[think]] it
supernaturall.




errors concerning abstract essences

from these metaphysiques, which are mingled with the [[scripture]] to make
schoole divinity, wee are told, there be in the [[world]] certaine
essences separated from bodies [[body]], which they call abstract essences, and
substantiall formes: for the interpreting of which jargon, there is
need of somewhat more than ordinary attention in this place. also i
ask pardon of those that are not used to this [[kind]] of discourse, for
applying my selfe to those that are. the [[world]], (i mean not the earth
onely, that denominates the lovers of it worldly [[men]], but the [[universe]],
that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is corporeall, that
is to say, [[body]]; and hath the dimensions of magnitude, namely, length,
bredth, and depth: also every part of [[body]], is likewise [[body]], and hath
the like dimensions; and consequently every part of the [[universe]],
is [[body]], and that which is not [[body]], is no part of the [[universe]]: and
because the [[universe]] is all, that which is no part of it, is nothing;
and consequently no where. nor does it [[follow]] from hence, that spirits
are nothing: for they have dimensions, and are therefore really bodies [[body]];
though that name in [[common]] [[speech]] be given to such bodies [[body]] onely, as are
visible, or palpable; that is, that have some [[degree]] of opacity: but for
spirits, they call them incorporeall; which is a name of more [[honour]],
and may therefore with more piety bee attributed to [[god]] himselfe; in
whom wee consider not what attribute expresseth [[best]] his [[nature]], which
is incomprehensible; but what [[best]] expresseth our [[desire]] to [[honour]] him.

to [[know]] now upon what grounds they say there be essences abstract, or
substantiall formes, wee are to consider what those words do properly
signifie. the use of words, is to register to our selves, and make
manifest to others the thoughts [[thought]] and conceptions of our minds [[mind]]. of which
words, some are the names of the things conceived; as the names of all
sorts of bodies [[body]], that [[work]] upon the senses, and leave an impression in
the [[imagination]]: others are the names of the imaginations [[imagination]] themselves;
that is to say, of those ideas [[idea]], or mentall images we have of all things
wee see, or [[remember]]: and others againe are names of names; or of
different sorts of [[speech]]: as universall, plurall, singular, negation,
true, false, syllogisme, interrogation, promise, covenant, are the names
of [[certain]] forms of [[speech]]. others serve to shew the consequence, or
repugnance of one name to another; as when one saith, "a [[man]] is a [[body]],"
hee intendeth that the name of [[body]] is necessarily consequent to the
name of [[man]]; as being but severall names of the same thing, [[man]]; which
consequence is signified by coupling them together with the word is.
and as wee use the verbe is; so the latines use their verbe est, and
the greeks [[greek]] their esti through all its declinations. whether all other
nations of the [[world]] have in their severall languages [[language]] a word that
answereth to it, or not, i cannot tell; but i am sure they have not need
of it: for the placing of two names in order may serve to signifie their
consequence, if it were the custome, (for custome is it, that give words
their [[force]],) as well as the words is, or bee, or are, and the like.

and if it were so, that there were a [[language]] without any verb
answerable to est, or is, or bee; yet the [[men]] that used it would bee
not a jot the lesse capable of inferring, concluding, and of all [[kind]] of
reasoning, than were the greeks [[greek]], and latines. but what then would become
of these terms, of entity, essence, essentiall, essentially, that are
derived from it, and of many more that depend on these, applyed as most
commonly they are? they are therefore no names of things; but signes, by
which wee make known, that wee conceive the consequence of one name or
attribute to another: as when we say, "a [[man]], is, a living [[body]]," wee
mean not that the [[man]] is one thing, the living [[body]] another, and the is,
or beeing a third: but that the [[man]], and the living [[body]], is the same
thing: because the consequence, "if hee bee a [[man]], hee is a living
body," is a true consequence, signified by that word is. therefore, to
bee a [[body]], to walke, to bee speaking, to [[live]], to see, and the like
infinitives; also corporeity, walking, speaking, [[life]], sight, and the
like, that signifie just the same, are the names of nothing; as i have
elsewhere more amply expressed.

but to what [[purpose]] (may some [[man]] say) is such subtilty in a [[work]] of
this [[nature]], where i pretend to nothing but what is necessary to the
doctrine of [[government]] and [[obedience]]? it is to this [[purpose]], that men
may no longer suffer themselves to be abused, by them, that by this
doctrine of separated essences, built on the [[vain]] [[philosophy]] of
aristotle, would fright them from obeying the laws [[law]] of their countrey,
with empty names; as [[men]] fright birds from the corn with an empty
doublet, a hat, and a crooked stick. for it is upon this ground, that
when a [[man]] is [[dead]] and buried, they say his soule (that is his life) can
walk separated from his [[body]], and is seen by night amongst the graves.
upon the same ground they say, that the figure, and colour, and tast of
a peece of bread, has a being, there, where they say there is no bread:
and upon the same ground they say, that [[faith]], and wisdome, and other
vertues are sometimes powred into a [[man]], sometimes blown into him from
heaven; as if the vertuous, and their vertues could be asunder; and a
great many other things that serve to lessen the dependance of subjects
on the soveraign [[power]] of their countrey. for who will endeavour to obey
the laws [[law]], if he expect [[obedience]] to be powred or blown into him? or who
will not obey a [[priest]], that can make [[god]], rather than his soveraign;
nay than [[god]] himselfe? or who, that is in [[fear]] of ghosts, will not bear
great [[respect]] to those that can make the holy water, that drives them
from him? and this shall suffice for an [[example]] of the errors, which are
brought into the [[church]], from the entities, and essences of [[aristotle]]:
which it may be he knew to be false [[philosophy]]; but writ it as a thing
consonant to, and corroborative of their [[religion]]; and fearing the fate
of [[socrates]].

being once fallen into this error of separated essences, they are
thereby necessarily involved in many other absurdities that [[follow]] it.
for seeing they will have these forms to be reall, they are obliged to
assign them some place. but because they hold them incorporeall, without
all dimension of quantity, and all [[men]] [[know]] that place is dimension, and
not to be filled, but by that which is corporeall; they are driven to
uphold their credit with a distinction, that they are not indeed any
where circumscriptive, but definitive: which terms being meer words, and
in this [[occasion]] insignificant, passe onely in latine, that the vanity
of them may bee concealed. for the circumscription of a thing, is
nothing else but the determination, or defining of its place; and so
both the terms of the distinction are the same. and in particular, of
the essence of a [[man]], which (they say) is his soule, they affirm it,
to be all of it in his little finger, and all of it in every other part
(how small soever) of his [[body]]; and yet no more soule in the whole [[body]],
than in any one of those parts. can any [[man]] [[think]] that [[god]] is served
with such absurdities? and yet all this is necessary to beleeve,
to those that will beleeve the existence of an incorporeall soule,
separated from the [[body]].

and when they come to give account, how an incorporeall substance can
be capable of [[pain]], and be tormented in the [[fire]] of hell, or [[purgatory]],
they have nothing at all to [[answer]], but that it cannot be known how fire
can burn soules.

again, whereas motion is [[change]] of place, and incorporeall substances
are not capable of place, they are troubled to make it seem possible,
how a soule can goe hence, without the [[body]] to [[heaven]], hell, or
purgatory; and how the ghosts of [[men]] (and i may adde of their clothes
which they appear in) can walk by night in churches [[church]], church-yards, and
other places of sepulture. to which i [[know]] not what they can [[answer]],
unlesse they will say, they walke definitive, not circumscriptive, or
spiritually, not temporally: for such egregious distinctions are equally
applicable to any difficulty whatsoever.




nunc-stans

for the meaning of eternity, they will not have it to be an endlesse
succession of [[time]]; for then they should not be able to render a reason
how gods will, and praeordaining of things to come, should not be before
his praescience of the same, as the efficient cause before the effect,
or agent before the action; nor of many other their bold opinions
concerning the incomprehensible [[nature]] of [[god]]. but they will [[teach]] us,
that eternity is the standing still of the [[present]] [[time]], a nunc-stans
(as the schools call it;) which neither they, nor any else [[understand]],
no more than they would a hic-stans for an infinite greatnesse of place.




one [[body]] in many places, and many bodies [[body]] in one place at once

and whereas [[men]] divide a [[body]] in their [[thought]], by numbring parts of
it, and in numbring those parts, number also the parts of the place
it filled; it cannot be, but in making many parts, wee make also many
places of those parts; whereby there cannot bee conceived in the [[mind]] of
any [[man]], more, or fewer parts, than there are places for: yet they will
have us beleeve, that by the almighty [[power]] of [[god]], one [[body]] may be at
one and the same [[time]] in many places; and many bodies [[body]] at one and the
same [[time]] in one place; as if it were an acknowledgment of the divine
power, to say, that which is, is not; or that which has been, has not
been. and these are but a small part of the incongruities they are
forced to, from their disputing philosophically, in stead of admiring,
and adoring of the [[divine]] and incomprehensible [[nature]]; whose attributes
cannot signifie what he is, but ought to signifie our [[desire]] to honour
him, with the [[best]] appellations we can [[think]] on. but they that venture
to [[reason]] of his [[nature]], from these attributes of [[honour]], losing their
understanding in the very first attempt, fall from one inconvenience
into another, without end, and without number; in the same manner,
as when a [[man]] ignorant of the ceremonies [[ceremony]] of court, comming into the
presence of a greater [[person]] than he is used to speak to, and stumbling
at his entrance, to save himselfe from falling, lets slip his cloake;
to recover his cloake, lets fall his hat; and with one disorder after
another, discovers his astonishment and rusticity.




absurdities in naturall [[philosophy]], as gravity the cause of heavinesse

then for physiques, that is, the [[knowledge]] of the subordinate, and
secundary causes of naturall events; they render none at all, but empty
words. if you [[desire]] to [[know]] why some [[kind]] of bodies [[body]] sink naturally
downwards toward the [[earth]], and others goe naturally from it; the
schools will tell you out of [[aristotle]], that the bodies [[body]] that sink
downwards, are heavy; and that this heavinesse is it that causes them to
descend: but if you ask what they mean by heavinesse, they will define
it to bee an endeavour to goe to the center of the [[earth]]: so that the
cause why things sink downward, is an endeavour to be below: which is
as much as to say, that bodies [[body]] descend, or ascend, because they doe.
or they will tell you the center of the [[earth]] is the place of rest, and
conservation for heavy things; and therefore they endeavour to be there:
as if stones, and metalls had a [[desire]], or could discern the place they
would bee at, as [[man]] does; or loved rest, as [[man]] does not; or that a
peece of glasse were lesse safe in the window, than falling into the
street.




quantity put into [[body]] already made

if we would [[know]] why the same [[body]] seems greater (without adding to it)
one [[time]], than another; they say, when it seems lesse, it is condensed;
when greater, rarefied. what is that condensed, and rarefied? condensed,
is when there is in the very same matter, lesse quantity than before;
and rarefied, when more. as if there could be matter, that had not some
determined quantity; when quantity is nothing else but the determination
of matter; that is to say of [[body]], by which we say one [[body]] is greater,
or lesser than another, by thus, or thus much. or as if a [[body]] were made
without any quantity at all, and that afterwards more, or lesse were put
into it, according as it is intended the [[body]] should be more, or lesse
dense.




powring in of soules

for the cause of the soule of [[man]], they say, creatur infundendo, and
creando infunditur: that is, "it is created by powring it in," and
"powred in by creation."




ubiquity of apparition

for the cause of sense, an ubiquity of [[species]]; that is, of the shews
or apparitions of objects; which when they be apparitions to the eye, is
sight; when to the eare, hearing; to the palate, tast; to the nostrill,
smelling; and to the rest of the [[body]], feeling.




will, the cause of willing

for cause of the will, to doe any particular action, which is called
volitio, they assign the faculty, that is to say, the capacity in
generall, that [[men]] have, to will sometimes one thing, sometimes another,
which is called voluntas; making the [[power]] the cause of the act: as
if one should assign for cause of the [[good]] or evill acts of [[men]], their
ability to doe them.




ignorance an occult cause

and in many occasions [[occasion]] they put for cause of naturall events, their own
ignorance, but disguised in other words: as when they say, [[fortune]] is
the cause of things contingent; that is, of things whereof they [[know]] no
cause: and as when they attribute many effects to occult qualities; that
is, qualities not known to them; and therefore also (as they thinke)
to no [[man]] else. and to sympathy, antipathy, antiperistasis, specificall
qualities, and other like termes, which signifie neither the agent that
produceth them, nor the operation by which they are produced.

if such metaphysiques, and physiques as this, be not [[vain]] [[philosophy]],
there was never any; nor needed st. paul to give us warning to avoid it.




one makes the things incongruent, another the incongruity

and for their morall, and civill [[philosophy]], it hath the same, or
greater absurdities. if a [[man]] doe an action of [[injustice]], that is to
say, an action contrary to the [[law]], [[god]] they say is the prime cause of
the [[law]], and also the prime cause of that, and all other actions; but no
cause at all of the [[injustice]]; which is the inconformity of the action
to the [[law]]. this is [[vain]] [[philosophy]]. a [[man]] might as well say, that one
man maketh both a streight line, and a crooked, and another maketh their
incongruity. and such is the [[philosophy]] of all [[men]] that resolve of their
conclusions, before they [[know]] their premises; pretending to comprehend,
that which is incomprehensible; and of attributes of [[honour]] to make
attributes of [[nature]]; as this distinction was made to maintain the
doctrine of free-will, that is, of a will of [[man]], not [[subject]] to the
will of [[god]].




private appetite the [[rule]] of publique [[good]]:

aristotle, and other heathen [[philosophers]] define [[good]], and evill, by the
appetite of [[men]]; and well enough, as long as we consider them governed
every one by his own [[law]]: for in the condition of [[men]] that have no other
law but their own appetites, there can be no generall [[rule]] of [[good]], and
evill actions. but in a common-wealth this measure is false: not the
appetite of private [[men]], but the [[law]], which is the will and appetite of
the [[state]] is the measure. and yet is this doctrine still practised; and
men [[judge]] the goodnesse, or wickednesse of their own, and of other mens
actions, and of the actions of the common-wealth it selfe, by their own
passions; and no [[man]] calleth [[good]] or evill, but that which is so in his
own [[eyes]], without any regard at all to the publique laws [[law]]; except onely
monks, and friers, that are bound by vow to that simple [[obedience]] to
their superiour, to which every [[subject]] ought to [[think]] himself bound by
the [[law]] of [[nature]] to the civill soveraign. and this private measure of
good, is a doctrine, not onely [[vain]], but also pernicious to the publique
state.




and that lawfull [[marriage]] is unchastity

it is also [[vain]] and false [[philosophy]], to say the [[work]] of [[marriage]] is
repugnant to chastity, or continence, and by consequence to make them
morall vices [[vice]]; as they doe, that pretend chastity, and continence, for
the ground of denying [[marriage]] to the clergy. for they confesse it is
no more, but a [[constitution]] of the [[church]], that requireth in those holy
orders that continually attend the altar, and administration of the
eucharist, a continuall abstinence from [[women]], under the name of
continuall chastity, continence, and purity. therefore they call the
lawfull use of wives [[wife]], want of chastity, and continence; and so make
marriage a [[sin]], or at least a thing so impure, and unclean, as to render
a [[man]] unfit for the altar. if the [[law]] were made because the use of wives
is incontinence, and contrary to chastity, then all [[marriage]] is [[vice]]; if
because it is a thing too impure, and unclean for a [[man]] consecrated to
god; much more should other naturall, necessary, and daily works [[work]] which
all [[men]] doe, render [[men]] unworthy to bee priests [[priest]], because they are more
unclean.

but the secret foundation of this prohibition of [[marriage]] of priests [[priest]], is
not likely to have been laid so slightly, as upon such errours in morall
philosophy; nor yet upon the preference of [[single]] [[life]], to the estate of
matrimony; which proceeded from the wisdome of st. paul, who perceived
how inconvenient a thing it was, for those that in those times [[time]] of
persecution were preachers of the gospel, and forced to fly from one
countrey to another, to be clogged with the [[care]] of [[wife]] and [[children]];
but upon the design of the popes, and priests [[priest]] of after times [[time]], to make
themselves the clergy, that is to say, sole heirs of the kingdome of god
in this [[world]]; to which it was necessary to take from them the use of
marriage, because our saviour saith, that at the coming of his kingdome
the [[children]] of [[god]] shall "neither [[marry]], nor bee given in [[marriage]], but
shall bee as the angels in [[heaven]];" that is to say, spirituall. seeing
then they had taken on them the name of spirituall, to have allowed
themselves (when there was no need) the propriety of wives [[wife]], had been an
incongruity.




and that all [[government]] but popular, is tyranny

from aristotles civill [[philosophy]], they have learned, to call all manner
of common-wealths but the popular, (such as was at that [[time]] the state
of [[athens]],) [[tyranny]]. all kings [[king]] they called tyrants [[tyrant]]; and the aristocracy
of the thirty governours set up there by the lacedemonians that subdued
them, the thirty tyrants [[tyrant]]: as also to call the condition of the people
under the [[democracy]], [[liberty]]. a [[tyrant]] originally signified no more
simply, but a monarch: but when afterwards in most parts of greece that
kind of [[government]] was abolished, the name began to signifie, not onely
the thing it did before, but with it, the [[hatred]] which the popular
states bare towards it: as also the name of [[king]] became odious after the
deposing of the kings [[king]] in [[rome]], as being a thing naturall to all [[men]],
to conceive some [[great]] [[fault]] to be signified in any attribute, that is
given in despight, and to a [[great]] [[enemy]]. and when the same [[men]] shall be
displeased with those that have the administration of the [[democracy]],
or [[aristocracy]], they are not to seek for disgraceful names to expresse
their anger in; but call readily the one [[anarchy]], and the other
oligarchy, or the [[tyranny]] of a few. and that which offendeth the [[people]],
is no other thing, but that they are governed, not as every one of them
would himselfe, but as the publique representant, be it one [[man]], or an
assembly of [[men]] thinks [[think]] fit; that is, by an arbitrary [[government]]: for
which they give evill names to their superiors; never knowing (till
perhaps a little after a civill warre) that without such arbitrary
government, such warre must be perpetuall; and that it is [[men]], and arms,
not words, and promises, that make the [[force]] and [[power]] of the laws [[law]].




that not [[men]], but [[law]] governs

and therefore this is another errour of aristotles politiques, that in
a wel ordered common-wealth, not [[men]] should govern, but the laws [[law]]. what
man, that has his naturall senses, though he can neither write nor [[read]],
does not find himself governed by them he fears [[fear]], and beleeves can kill
or hurt him when he obeyeth not? or that beleeves the [[law]] can hurt him;
that is, words, and paper, without the hands, and swords [[sword]] of [[men]]? and
this is of the number of pernicious errors: for they induce [[men]], as oft
as they like not their governours, to adhaere to those that call them
tyrants, and to [[think]] it lawfull to raise warre against them: and yet
they are many times [[time]] cherished from the pulpit, by the clergy.




laws over the conscience

there is another errour in their civill [[philosophy]] (which they never
learned of [[aristotle]], nor cicero, nor any other of the heathen,) to
extend the [[power]] of the [[law]], which is the [[rule]] of actions onely, to the
very thoughts [[thought]], and consciences of [[men]], by examination, and inquisition
of what they hold, notwithstanding the conformity of their [[speech]] and
actions: by which, [[men]] are either punished for answering the truth
of their thoughts [[thought]], or constrained to [[answer]] an untruth for [[fear]] of
punishment. it is true, that the civill magistrate, intending to employ
a minister in the charge of teaching, may enquire of him, if hee bee
content to preach such, and such doctrines; and in case of refusall,
may deny him the employment: but to [[force]] him to accuse himselfe of
opinions, when his actions are not by [[law]] forbidden, is against the
law of [[nature]]; and especially in them, who [[teach]], that a [[man]] shall bee
damned to eternall and extream torments, if he [[die]] in a false opinion
concerning an article of the [[christian]] [[faith]]. for who is there, that
knowing there is so [[great]] danger in an error, when the naturall care
of himself, compelleth not to hazard his soule upon his own judgement,
rather than that of any other [[man]] that is unconcerned in his damnation?




private interpretation of law

for a private [[man]], without the [[authority]] of the common-wealth, that is
to say, without permission from the representant thereof, to interpret
the [[law]] by his own spirit, is another error in the politiques; but not
drawn from [[aristotle]], nor from any other of the heathen [[philosophers]].
for none of them deny, but that in the [[power]] of making laws [[law]], is
comprehended also the [[power]] of explaining them when there is need. and
are not the scriptures [[scripture]], in all places where they are [[law]], made [[law]] by
the [[authority]] of the common-wealth, and consequently, a part of the
civill [[law]]?

of the same [[kind]] it is also, when any but the soveraign restraineth in
any [[man]] that [[power]] which the common-wealth hath not restrained: as they
do, that impropriate the preaching of the gospell to one [[certain]] order
of [[men]], where the laws [[law]] have left it [[free]]. if the [[state]] give me leave to
preach, or [[teach]]; that is, if it forbid me not, no [[man]] can forbid me.
if i find my selfe amongst the idolaters of [[america]], shall i that am a
christian, though not in orders, [[think]] it a [[sin]] to preach [[jesus]] [[christ]],
till i have received orders from [[rome]]? or when i have preached, shall
not i [[answer]] their doubts [[doubt]], and expound the scriptures [[scripture]] to them; that is
shall i not [[teach]]? but for this may some say, as also for administring
to them the sacraments, the necessity shall be esteemed for a sufficient
mission; which is true: but this is true also, that for whatsoever,
a dispensation is due for the necessity, for the same there needs no
dispensation, when there is no [[law]] that forbids it. therefore to deny
these functions to those, to whom the civill soveraigne hath not denyed
them, is a taking away of a lawfull [[liberty]], which is contrary to the
doctrine of civill [[government]].




language of schoole-divines

more examples [[example]] of [[vain]] [[philosophy]], brought into [[religion]] by the doctors
of schoole-divinity, might be produced; but other [[men]] may if they please
observe them of themselves. i shall onely adde this, that the
writings of schoole-divines, are nothing else for the most part, but
insignificant traines of [[strange]] and barbarous words, or words otherwise
used, then in the [[common]] use of the latine tongue; such as would pose
cicero, and varro, and all the grammarians of ancient [[rome]]. which if any
man would see proved, let him (as i have said once before) see whether
he can translate any schoole-divine into any of the [[modern]] tongues, as
french, english, or any other copious [[language]]: for that which cannot
in most of these be made intelligible, is no intelligible in the latine.
which insignificancy of [[language]], though i cannot note it for false
philosophy; yet it hath a quality, not onely to hide the [[truth]], but also
to make [[men]] [[think]] they have it, and desist from further search.




errors from tradition

lastly, for the errors brought in from false, or uncertain [[history]], what
is all the legend of fictitious [[miracles]], in the lives [[life]] of the saints;
and all the histories [[history]] of apparitions, and ghosts, alledged by the
doctors of the romane [[church]], to make [[good]] their doctrines of hell, and
purgatory, the [[power]] of exorcisme, and other doctrines which have no
warrant, neither in [[reason]], nor [[scripture]]; as also all those traditions
which they call the unwritten word of [[god]]; but old wives [[wife]] fables?
whereof, though they find dispersed somewhat in the writings of the
ancient fathers [[father]]; yet those fathers [[father]] were [[men]], that might too easily
beleeve false reports; and the producing of their opinions [[opinion]] for testimony
of the [[truth]] of what they beleeved, hath no other [[force]] with them that
(according to the counsell of st. john 1 epist. chap. 4. verse 1.)
examine spirits, than in all things that concern the [[power]] of the romane
church, (the [[abuse]] whereof either they suspected not, or had benefit
by it,) to discredit their testimony, in [[respect]] of too rash beleef of
reports; which the most sincere [[men]], without [[great]] [[knowledge]] of naturall
causes, (such as the fathers [[father]] were) are commonly the most [[subject]] to: for
naturally, the [[best]] [[men]] are the least suspicious of fraudulent purposes [[purpose]].
gregory the [[pope]], and s. bernard have somewhat of apparitions of ghosts,
that said they were in [[purgatory]]; and so has our beda: but no where, i
beleeve, but by report from others. but if they, or any other, relate
any such stories of their own [[knowledge]], they shall not thereby confirm
the more such [[vain]] reports; but discover their own infirmity, or fraud.




suppression of reason

with the introduction of false, we may joyn also the suppression of true
philosophy, by such [[men]], as neither by lawfull [[authority]], nor sufficient
study, are competent judges [[judge]] of the [[truth]]. our own navigations make
manifest, and all [[men]] learned in humane sciences [[science]], now acknowledge there
are antipodes: and every day it appeareth more and more, that years, and
dayes are determined by motions of the [[earth]]. neverthelesse, [[men]] that
have in their writings but supposed such doctrine, as an [[occasion]] to
lay open the reasons [[reason]] for, and against it, have been punished for it
by [[authority]] ecclesiasticall. but what [[reason]] is there for it? is it
because such opinions [[opinion]] are contrary to true [[religion]]? that cannot be,
if they be true. let therefore the [[truth]] be first examined by competent
judges, or confuted by them that pretend to [[know]] the contrary. is
it because they be contrary to the [[religion]] established? let them be
silenced by the laws [[law]] of those, to whom the teachers of them are [[subject]];
that is, by the laws [[law]] civill: for disobedience may lawfully be punished
in them, that against the laws [[law]] [[teach]] even true [[philosophy]]. is it because
they tend to disorder in [[government]], as countenancing rebellion, or
sedition? then let them be silenced, and the teachers punished by vertue
of his [[power]] to whom the [[care]] of the publique quiet is committed; which
is the [[authority]] civill. for whatsoever [[power]] ecclesiastiques take upon
themselves (in any place where they are [[subject]] to the state) in their
own [[right]], though they call it gods [[right]], is but usurpation.




chapter xlvii. of the benefit that proceedeth from such darknesse, and
to whom it accreweth




he that receiveth benefit by a [[fact]], is presumed to be the author

cicero maketh honorable mention of one of the cassii, a severe judge
amongst the romans, for a custome he had, in [[criminal]] causes, (when the
testimony of the witnesses was not sufficient,) to ask the accusers,
cui bono; that is to say, what [[profit]], [[honor]], or other contentment, the
accused obtained, or expected by the [[fact]]. for amongst praesumptions,
there is none that so evidently declareth the author, as doth the
benefit of the action. by the same [[rule]] i intend in this place to
examine, who they may be, that have possessed the [[people]] so long in this
part of christendome, with these doctrines, contrary to the peaceable
societies of [[mankind]].




that the [[church]] militant is the kingdome of [[god]], was first taught by
the [[church]] of rome

and first, to this error, that the [[present]] [[church]] now militant on [[earth]],
is the kingdome of [[god]], (that is, the kingdome of [[glory]], or the [[land]] of
promise; not the kingdome of grace, which is but a promise of the
land,) are annexed these worldly benefits, first, that the [[pastors]],
and teachers of the [[church]], are entitled thereby, as gods publique
ministers, to a [[right]] of governing the [[church]]; and consequently (because
the [[church]], and common-wealth are the same persons) to be rectors, and
governours of the common-wealth. by this title it is, that the pope
prevailed with the subjects [[subject]] of all [[christian]] princes [[prince]], to beleeve, that
to disobey him, was to disobey [[christ]] himselfe; and in all differences
between him and other princes [[prince]], (charmed with the word [[power]] spirituall,)
to abandon their lawfull soveraigns; which is in effect an universall
monarchy over all christendome. for though they were first invested in
the [[right]] of being supreme teachers of [[christian]] doctrine, by, and
under [[christian]] emperors [[emperor]], within the limits of the romane [[empire]] (as is
acknowledged by themselves) by the title of pontifex maximus, who was an
officer [[subject]] to the civill [[state]]; yet after the [[empire]] was divided,
and dissolved, it was not hard to obtrude upon the [[people]] already
subject to them, another title, namely, the [[right]] of st. peter; not
onely to save entire their pretended [[power]]; but also to extend the same
over the same [[christian]] provinces, though no more [[united]] in the empire
of [[rome]]. this benefit of an universall [[monarchy]], (considering the desire
of [[men]] to bear rule) is a sufficient presumption, that the popes that
pretended to it, and for a long [[time]] enjoyed it, were the authors of
the doctrine, by which it was obtained; namely, that the [[church]] now
on [[earth]], is the kingdome of [[christ]]. for that granted, it must be
understood, that [[christ]] hath some lieutenant amongst us, by whom we are
to be told what are his commandements.

after that [[certain]] churches [[church]] had renounced this universall [[power]] of the
pope, one would expect in [[reason]], that the civill soveraigns in all
those churches [[church]], should have recovered so much of it, as (before they had
unadvisedly let it goe) was their own [[right]], and in their own hands.
and in [[england]] it was so in effect; saving that they, by whom the kings
administred the [[government]] of [[religion]], by maintaining their imployment
to be in gods [[right]], seemed to usurp, if not a [[supremacy]], yet an
independency on the civill [[power]]: and they but seemed to usurp it, in
as much as they acknowledged a [[right]] in the [[king]], to deprive them of the
exercise of their functions at his [[pleasure]].




and maintained also by the presbytery

but in those places where the presbytery took that office, though many
other doctrines of the [[church]] of [[rome]] were forbidden to be taught; yet
this doctrine, that the kingdome of [[christ]] is already come, and that it
began at the resurrection of our saviour, was still retained. but cui
bono? what [[profit]] did they expect from it? the same which the popes
expected: to have a soveraign [[power]] over the [[people]]. for what is it for
men to excommunicate their lawful [[king]], but to keep him from all places
of gods publique service in his own [[kingdom]]? and with [[force]] to resist
him, when he with [[force]] endeavoureth to [[correct]] them? or what is it,
without [[authority]] from the civill soveraign, to excommunicate any
person, but to take from him his lawfull [[liberty]], that is, to usurpe
an unlawfull [[power]] over their brethren [[brother]]? the authors therefore of this
darknesse in [[religion]], are the romane, and the presbyterian clergy.




infallibility

to this head, i referre also all those doctrines, that serve them to
keep the possession of this spirituall soveraignty after it is gotten.
as first, that the [[pope]] in his publique capacity cannot erre. for who
is there, that beleeving this to be true, will not readily obey him in
whatsoever he commands?




subjection of bishops

secondly, that all other bishops, in what common-wealth soever, have
not their [[right]], neither immediately from [[god]], nor mediately from their
civill soveraigns, but from the [[pope]], is a doctrine, by which there
comes to be in every [[christian]] common-wealth many potent [[men]], (for so
are bishops,) that have their dependance on the [[pope]], and owe obedience
to him, though he be a forraign [[prince]]; by which means he is able, (as
he hath done many times) to raise a civill [[war]] against the state
that submits not it [[self]] to be governed according to his [[pleasure]] and
interest.




exemptions of the clergy

thirdly, the exemption of these, and of all other priests [[priest]], and of all
monkes, and fryers, from the [[power]] of the civill laws [[law]]. for by this
means, there is a [[great]] part of every common-wealth, that enjoy the
benefit of the laws [[law]], and are protected by the [[power]] of the civill [[state]],
which neverthelesse [[pay]] no part of the publique expence; nor are
lyable to the penalties, as other subjects [[subject]], due to their crimes; and
consequently, stand not in [[fear]] of any [[man]], but the [[pope]]; and adhere to
him onely, to uphold his universall [[monarchy]].




the names of sacerdotes, and sacrifices

fourthly, the giving to their priests [[priest]] (which is no more in the new
testament but presbyters, that is, elders) the name of sacerdotes, that
is, sacrificers, which was the title of the civill soveraign, and his
publique ministers, amongst the [[jews]], whilest [[god]] was their [[king]]. also,
the making the lords [[lord]] supper a [[sacrifice]], serveth to make the people
beleeve the [[pope]] hath the same [[power]] over all [[christian]], that moses
and aaron had over the [[jews]]; that is to say, all [[power]], both civill and
ecclesiasticall, as the high [[priest]] then had.




the sacramentation of marriage

fiftly, the teaching that matrimony is a sacrament, giveth to the
clergy the judging of the lawfulnesse of marriages [[marriage]]; and thereby, of what
children are legitimate; and consequently, of the [[right]] of succession to
haereditary kingdomes.




the [[single]] [[life]] of priests

sixtly, the deniall of [[marriage]] to priests [[priest]], serveth to assure this power
of the [[pope]] over kings [[king]]. for if a [[king]] be a [[priest]], he cannot [[marry]], and
transmit his kingdome to his [[posterity]]; if he be not a [[priest]] then the
pope pretendeth this [[authority]] ecclesiasticall over him, and over his
people.




auricular confession

seventhly, from auricular [[confession]], they obtain, for the assurance of
their [[power]], [[better]] [[intelligence]] of the designs of princes [[prince]], and great
persons in the civill [[state]], than these can have of the designs of the
state ecclesiasticall.




canonization of saints, and declaring of martyrs

eighthly, by the canonization of saints, and declaring who are martyrs,
they assure their [[power]], in that they induce simple [[men]] into an
obstinacy against the laws [[law]] and commands of their civill soveraigns even
to [[death]], if by the popes excommunication, they be declared heretiques
or enemies [[enemy]] to the [[church]]; that is, (as they interpret it,) to the [[pope]].




transubstantiation, penance, absolution

ninthly, they assure the same, by the [[power]] they ascribe to every
priest, of making [[christ]]; and by the [[power]] of ordaining pennance; and of
remitting, and retaining of sins [[sin]].




purgatory, indulgences, externall works

tenthly, by the doctrine of [[purgatory]], of justification by externall
works, and of indulgences, the clergy is enriched.




daemonology and exorcism

eleventhly, by their daemonology, and the use of exorcisme, and other
things appertaining thereto, they keep (or thinke they keep) the people
more in awe of their [[power]].




school-divinity

lastly, the metaphysiques, ethiques, and politiques of [[aristotle]], the
frivolous distinctions, barbarous terms, and obscure [[language]] of the
schoolmen, taught in the universities [[university]], (which have been all erected and
regulated by the popes [[authority]],) serve them to keep these errors
from being detected, and to make [[men]] mistake the ignis fatuus of vain
philosophy, for the [[light]] of the gospell.




the authors of spirituall darknesse, who they be

to these, if they sufficed not, might be added other of their dark
doctrines, the [[profit]] whereof redoundeth manifestly, to the setting up
of an unlawfull [[power]] over the lawfull soveraigns of [[christian]] [[people]];
or for the sustaining of the same, when it is set up; or to the worldly
riches, [[honour]], and [[authority]] of those that sustain it. and therefore by
the aforesaid [[rule]], of cui bono, we may justly pronounce for the authors
of all this spirituall darknesse, the [[pope]], and roman clergy, and
all those besides that endeavour to settle in the mindes of [[men]] this
erroneous doctrine, that the [[church]] now on [[earth]], is that kingdome of
god mentioned in the old and new testament.

but the emperours, and other [[christian]] soveraigns, under whose
government these errours, and the like encroachments of ecclesiastiques
upon their office, at first crept in, to the disturbance of their
possessions, and of the tranquillity of their subjects [[subject]], though they
suffered the same for want of foresight of the sequel, and of insight
into the designs of their teachers, may neverthelesse bee esteemed
accessories to their own, and the publique dammage; for without
their [[authority]] there could at first no seditious doctrine have been
publiquely preached. i say they might have hindred the same in the
beginning: but when the [[people]] were once possessed by those spirituall
men, there was no humane remedy to be applyed, that any [[man]] could
invent: and for the remedies that [[god]] should provide, who never faileth
in his [[good]] [[time]] to [[destroy]] all the machinations of [[men]] against the
truth, wee are to attend his [[good]] [[pleasure]], that suffereth many times
the [[prosperity]] of his enemies [[enemy]], together with their [[ambition]], to grow
to such a height, as the [[violence]] thereof openeth the [[eyes]], which the
warinesse of their predecessours had before sealed up, and makes men
by too much grasping let goe all, as peters net was broken, by the
struggling of too [[great]] a multitude of fishes; whereas the impatience
of those, that strive to resist such encroachment, before their subjects
eyes were opened, did but encrease the [[power]] they resisted. i doe not
therefore blame the emperour frederick for holding the stirrop to our
countryman [[pope]] adrian; for such was the disposition of his subjects
then, as if hee had not doe it, hee was not likely to have succeeded in
the [[empire]]: but i blame those, that in the beginning, when their power
was entire, by suffering such doctrines to be forged in the universities
of their own dominions, have holden the stirrop to all the succeeding
popes, whilest they mounted into the thrones of all christian
soveraigns, to ride, and tire, both them, and their [[people]], at their
pleasure.

but as the inventions of [[men]] are woven, so also are they ravelled out;
the way is the same, but the order is inverted: the web begins at the
first elements of [[power]], which are [[wisdom]], [[humility]], sincerity, and
other vertues of the [[apostles]], whom the [[people]] converted, obeyed, out
of reverence, not by obligation: their consciences were [[free]], and their
words and actions [[subject]] to none but the civill [[power]]. afterwards the
presbyters (as the flocks of [[christ]] encreased) assembling to consider
what they should [[teach]], and thereby obliging themselves to [[teach]] nothing
against the decrees of their assemblies, made it to be [[thought]] the
people were thereby obliged to [[follow]] their doctrine, and when
they refused, refused to keep them company, (that was then called
excommunication,) not as being infidels, but as being disobedient: and
this was the first knot upon their [[liberty]]. and the number of presbyters
encreasing, the presbyters of the [[chief]] [[city]] or province, got themselves
an [[authority]] over the parochiall presbyters, and appropriated to
themselves the names of bishops: and this was a second knot on christian
liberty. lastly, the bishop of [[rome]], in regard of the imperiall [[city]],
took upon him an [[authority]] (partly by the wills of the emperours
themselves, and by the title of pontifex maximus, and at [[last]] when the
emperours were grown [[weak]], by the priviledges of st. peter) over all
other bishops of the [[empire]]: which was the third and [[last]] knot, and the
whole synthesis and construction of the pontificall [[power]].

and therefore the analysis, or resolution is by the same way; but
beginning with the knot that was [[last]] tyed; as wee may see in the
dissolution of the praeterpoliticall [[church]] [[government]] in [[england]].

first, the [[power]] of the popes was dissolved totally by queen elizabeth;
and the bishops, who before exercised their functions in [[right]] of the
pope, did afterwards exercise the same in [[right]] of the queen and her
successours; though by retaining the phrase of jure divino, they were
thought to demand it by immediate [[right]] from [[god]]: and so was untyed the
first knot. after this, the presbyterians lately in [[england]] obtained the
putting down of episcopacy: and so was the second knot dissolved:
and almost at the same [[time]], the [[power]] was taken also from the
presbyterians: and so we are reduced to the independency of the
primitive christians [[christian]] to [[follow]] paul, or cephas, or apollos, every man
as he liketh [[best]]: which, if it be without contention, and without
measuring the doctrine of [[christ]], by our affection to the [[person]] of his
minister, (the [[fault]] which the apostle reprehended in the corinthians,)
is perhaps the [[best]]: first, because there ought to be no [[power]] over the
consciences of [[men]], but of the word it selfe, working [[faith]] in every
one, not alwayes according to the [[purpose]] of them that plant and water,
but of [[god]] himself, that giveth the increase: and secondly, because it
is unreasonable in them, who [[teach]] there is such danger in every little
errour, to require of a [[man]] endued with [[reason]] of his own, to [[follow]] the
reason of any other [[man]], or of the most voices of many other [[men]]; which
is little [[better]], then to venture his salvation at crosse and pile. nor
ought those teachers to be displeased with this losse of their antient
authority: for there is none should [[know]] [[better]] then they, that [[power]] is
preserved by the same vertues by which it is acquired; that is to
say, by wisdome, [[humility]], clearnesse of doctrine, and sincerity of
conversation; and not by suppression of the naturall sciences [[science]], and
of the morality of naturall [[reason]]; nor by obscure [[language]]; nor by
arrogating to themselves more [[knowledge]] than they make appear; nor by
pious frauds; nor by such other faults [[fault]], as in the [[pastors]] of gods church
are not only faults [[fault]], but also scandalls, apt to make [[men]] stumble one
time or other upon the suppression of their [[authority]].




comparison of the papacy with the kingdome of fayries

but after this doctrine, "that the [[church]] now militant, is the kingdome
of [[god]] spoken of in the old and new testament," was received in
the [[world]]; the [[ambition]], and canvasing for the offices that belong
thereunto, and especially for that [[great]] office of being christs
lieutenant, and the pompe of them that obtained therein the principal
publique charges, became by degrees [[degree]] so evident, that they lost the
inward reverence due to the pastorall function: in so much as the wisest
men, of them that had any [[power]] in the civill [[state]], needed nothing but
the [[authority]] of their princes [[prince]], to deny them any further [[obedience]]. for,
from the [[time]] that the bishop of [[rome]] had gotten to be acknowledged for
bishop universall, by pretence of succession to st. peter, their whole
hierarchy, or kingdome of darknesse, may be compared not unfitly to
the kingdome of fairies; that is, to the old wives [[wife]] fables in [[england]],
concerning ghosts and spirits, and the feats they play in the night. and
if a [[man]] consider the originall of this [[great]] ecclesiasticall dominion,
he will easily perceive, that the papacy, is no other, than the ghost of
the deceased romane [[empire]], sitting crowned upon the grave thereof: for
so did the papacy start up on a sudden out of the ruines of that heathen
power.

the [[language]] also, which they use, both in the churches [[church]], and in their
publique acts, being latine, which is not commonly used by any nation
now in the [[world]], what is it but the ghost of the old romane [[language]].

the fairies in what nation soever they converse, have but one universall
king, which some poets of ours call [[king]] oberon; but the [[scripture]] calls
beelzebub, [[prince]] of daemons. the ecclesiastiques likewise, in whose
dominions soever they be found, acknowledge but one universall [[king]], the
pope.

the ecclesiastiques are spirituall [[men]], and ghostly fathers [[father]]. the
fairies are spirits, and ghosts. fairies and ghosts inhabite darknesse,
solitudes, and graves. the ecclesiastiques walke in obscurity of
doctrine, in monasteries, churches [[church]], and churchyards.

the ecclesiastiques have their cathedral churches [[church]]; which, in what towne
soever they be erected, by vertue of holy water, and [[certain]] charmes
called exorcismes, have the [[power]] to make those townes, cities [[city]], that is
to say, seats of [[empire]]. the fairies also have their enchanted castles,
and [[certain]] gigantique ghosts, that domineer over the regions round
about them.

the fairies are not to be seized on; and brought to [[answer]] for the hurt
they do. so also the ecclesiastiques vanish away from the tribunals of
civill [[justice]].

the ecclesiastiques take from [[young]] [[men]], the use of [[reason]], by certain
charms compounded of metaphysiques, and [[miracles]], and traditions, and
abused [[scripture]], whereby they are [[good]] for nothing else, but to execute
what they command them. the fairies likewise are said to take young
children out of their cradles, and to [[change]] them into naturall fools [[fool]],
which [[common]] [[people]] do therefore call elves, and are apt to mischief.

in what shop, or operatory the fairies make their enchantment, the old
wives have not determined. but the operatories of the clergy, are well
enough known to be the universities [[university]], that received their discipline from
authority pontificall.

when the fairies are displeased with any [[body]], they are said to
send their elves, to pinch them. the ecclesiastiques, when they are
displeased with any civill [[state]], make also their elves, that is,
superstitious, enchanted subjects [[subject]], to pinch their princes [[prince]], by preaching
sedition; or one [[prince]] enchanted with promises, to pinch another.

the fairies [[marry]] not; but there be amongst them incubi, that have
copulation with flesh and bloud. the priests [[priest]] also [[marry]] not.

the ecclesiastiques take the cream of the [[land]], by donations of ignorant
men, that stand in aw of them, and by tythes: so also it is in the fable
of fairies, that they enter into the dairies, and feast upon the cream,
which they skim from the milk.

what [[kind]] of [[money]] is currant in the kingdome of fairies, is not
recorded in the story. but the ecclesiastiques in their receipts accept
of the same [[money]] that we doe; though when they are to make any payment,
it is in canonizations, indulgences, and masses.

to this, and such like resemblances between the papacy, and the kingdome
of fairies, may be added this, that as the fairies have no existence,
but in the fancies of ignorant [[people]], rising from the traditions of old
wives, or old poets: so the spirituall [[power]] of the [[pope]] (without the
bounds of his own civill dominion) consisteth onely in the [[fear]] that
seduced [[people]] stand in, of their excommunication; upon hearing of false
miracles, false traditions, and false interpretations of the [[scripture]].

it was not therefore a very difficult matter, for henry 8. by his
exorcisme; nor for qu. elizabeth by hers, to cast them out. but who
knows that this spirit of [[rome]], now gone out, and walking by missions
through the dry places of [[china]], japan, and the indies, that yeeld him
little fruit, may not return, or rather an assembly of spirits worse
than he, enter, and inhabite this clean swept house, and make the end
thereof worse than the beginning? for it is not the romane clergy onely,
that pretends the kingdome of [[god]] to be of this [[world]], and thereby to
have a [[power]] therein, distinct from that of the civill [[state]]. and
this is all i had a designe to say, concerning the doctrine of the
politiques. which when i have reviewed, i shall willingly expose it to
the censure of my countrey.




a review, and conclusion


from the contrariety of some of the naturall faculties of the [[mind]], one
to another, as also of one passion to another, and from their reference
to conversation, there has been an argument taken, to inferre an
impossibility that any one [[man]] should be sufficiently disposed to all
sorts of civill [[duty]]. the severity of [[judgment]], they say, makes men
censorious, and unapt to pardon the errours and infirmities of other
men: and on the other side, celerity of fancy, makes the thoughts [[thought]] lesse
steddy than is necessary, to discern exactly between [[right]] and [[wrong]].
again, in all deliberations, and in all pleadings, the faculty of solid
reasoning, is necessary: for without it, the resolutions of [[men]] are
rash, and their sentences [[unjust]]: and yet if there be not powerfull
eloquence, which procureth attention and [[consent]], the effect of reason
will be little. but these are contrary faculties; the former being
grounded upon principles [[principle]] of [[truth]]; the other upon opinions [[opinion]] already
received, true, or false; and upon the [[passions]] and interests of [[men]],
which are different, and mutable.

and amongst the [[passions]], [[courage]], (by which i mean the contempt of
wounds, and [[violent]] death) enclineth [[men]] to private revenges, and
sometimes to endeavour the unsetling of the publique [[peace]]; and
timorousnesse, many times [[time]] disposeth to the desertion of the publique
defence. both these they say cannot stand together in the same [[person]].

and to consider the contrariety of mens [[men]] opinions [[opinion]], and manners in
generall, it is they say, impossible to entertain a constant civill
amity with all those, with whom the businesse of the [[world]] constrains
us to converse: which businesse consisteth almost in nothing else but a
perpetuall contention for [[honor]], riches [[rich]], and [[authority]].

to which i [[answer]], that these are indeed [[great]] difficulties, but not
impossibilities: for by [[education]], and discipline, they may bee, and
are sometimes reconciled. [[judgment]], and fancy may have place in the
same [[man]]; but by turnes; as the end which he aimeth at requireth. as the
israelites in [[egypt]], were sometimes fastened to their [[labour]] of making
bricks, and other times [[time]] were ranging abroad to gather straw: so also may
the [[judgment]] sometimes be fixed upon one [[certain]] consideration, and
the fancy at another [[time]] wandring about the [[world]]. so also [[reason]],
and eloquence, (though not perhaps in the naturall sciences [[science]], yet in the
morall) may stand very well together. for wheresoever there is place for
adorning and preferring of errour, there is much more place for adorning
and preferring of [[truth]], if they have it to adorn. nor is there any
repugnancy between fearing the laws [[law]], and not fearing a publique [[enemy]];
nor between abstaining from injury, and pardoning it in others. there is
therefore no such inconsistence of humane [[nature]], with civill duties [[duty]],
as some [[think]]. i have known cleernesse of [[judgment]], and largenesse of
fancy; [[strength]] of [[reason]], and gracefull elocution; a [[courage]] for the
warre, and a [[fear]] for the laws [[law]], and all eminently in one [[man]]; and that
was my most [[noble]] and honored friend mr. sidney godolphin; who hating no
man, nor hated of any, was unfortunately slain in the beginning of the
late civill warre, in the publique quarrel, by an indiscerned, and an
undiscerning hand.

to the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], declared in the 15. [[chapter]], i would have this
added, "that every [[man]] is bound by [[nature]], as much as in him lieth, to
protect in warre, the [[authority]], by which he is himself protected in
time of [[peace]]." for he that pretendeth a [[right]] of [[nature]] to preserve
his owne [[body]], cannot pretend a [[right]] of [[nature]] to [[destroy]] him, by whose
strength he is preserved: it is a manifest contradiction of himselfe.
and though this [[law]] may bee drawn by consequence, from some of those
that are there already mentioned; yet the times [[time]] require to have it
inculcated, and remembred.

and because i find by divers english books [[book]] lately printed, that the
civill warres have not yet sufficiently taught [[men]], in what point of
time it is, that a [[subject]] becomes obliged to the conquerour; nor what
is [[conquest]]; nor how it comes about, that it obliges [[men]] to obey his
laws: therefore for farther satisfaction of [[men]] therein, i say, the
point of [[time]], wherein a [[man]] becomes [[subject]] of a conquerour, is that
point, wherein having [[liberty]] to submit to him, he consenteth, either by
expresse words, or by other sufficient sign, to be his [[subject]]. when it
is that a [[man]] hath the [[liberty]] to submit, i have showed before in the
end of the 21. [[chapter]]; namely, that for him that hath no obligation to
his former soveraign but that of an ordinary [[subject]], it is then, when
the means of his [[life]] is within the guards and garrisons of the [[enemy]];
for it is then, that he hath no longer protection from him, but is
protected by the adverse party for his contribution. seeing
therefore such contribution is every where, as a thing inevitable,
(notwithstanding it be an assistance to the [[enemy]],) esteemed lawfull;
as totall submission, which is but an assistance to the [[enemy]], cannot
be esteemed unlawfull. besides, if a [[man]] consider that they who submit,
assist the [[enemy]] but with part of their estates, whereas they that
refuse, assist him with the whole, there is no [[reason]] to call their
submission, or composition an assistance; but rather a detriment to the
enemy. but if a [[man]], besides the obligation of a [[subject]], hath taken
upon him a new obligation of a souldier, then he hath not the liberty
to submit to a new [[power]], as long as the old one keeps the field, and
giveth him means of subsistence, either in his armies [[army]], or garrisons:
for in this case, he cannot [[complain]] of want of protection, and means to
live as a souldier: but when that also failes, a souldier also may seek
his protection wheresoever he has most [[hope]] to have it; and may lawfully
submit himself to his new master. and so much for the [[time]] when he may
do it lawfully, if hee will. if therefore he doe it, he is undoubtedly
bound to be a true [[subject]]: for a contract lawfully made, cannot
lawfully be broken.

by this also a [[man]] may [[understand]], when it is, that [[men]] may be said to
be conquered; and in what the [[nature]] of [[conquest]], and the [[right]] of a
conquerour consisteth: for this submission is it implyeth them all.
conquest, is not the [[victory]] it [[self]]; but the acquisition by [[victory]],
of a [[right]], over the persons [[person]] of [[men]]. he therefore that is slain, is
overcome, but not conquered; he that is taken, and put into prison, or
chaines, is not conquered, though overcome; for he is still an [[enemy]],
and may save himself if hee can: but he that upon promise of [[obedience]],
hath his [[life]] and [[liberty]] allowed him, is then conquered, and a [[subject]];
and not before. the romanes used to say, that their generall had
pacified such a province, that is to say, in english, conquered it; and
that the countrey was pacified by [[victory]], when the [[people]] of it
had promised imperata facere, that is, to doe what the romane people
commanded them: this was to be conquered. but this promise may be either
expresse, or tacite: expresse, by promise: tacite, by other signes. as
for [[example]], a [[man]] that hath not been called to make such an expresse
promise, (because he is one whose [[power]] perhaps is not considerable;)
yet if he [[live]] under their protection openly, hee is understood to
submit himselfe to the [[government]]: but if he [[live]] there secretly, he is
lyable to any thing that may bee done to a spie, and [[enemy]] of the [[state]].
i say not, hee does any [[injustice]], (for acts of open hostility bear not
that name); but that he may be justly put to [[death]]. likewise, if a [[man]],
when his [[country]] is conquered, be out of it, he is not conquered, nor
subject: but if at his return, he submit to the [[government]], he is bound
to obey it. so that [[conquest]] (to define it) is the acquiring of the
right of soveraignty by [[victory]]. which [[right]], is acquired, in the
peoples submission, by which they contract with the victor, promising
obedience, for [[life]] and [[liberty]].

in the 29th [[chapter]] i have set down for one of the causes of the
dissolutions of common-wealths, their imperfect [[generation]], consisting
in the want of an absolute and arbitrary legislative [[power]]; for want
whereof, the civill soveraign is fain to handle the [[sword]] of justice
unconstantly, and as if it were too hot for him to hold: one reason
whereof (which i have not there mentioned) is this, that they will all
of them justifie the [[war]], by which their [[power]] was at first gotten,
and whereon (as they think) their [[right]] dependeth, and not on the
possession. as if, for [[example]], the [[right]] of the kings [[king]] of [[england]] did
depend on the goodnesse of the cause of william the conquerour, and upon
their lineall, and directest descent from him; by which means, there
would perhaps be no tie of the subjects [[subject]] [[obedience]] to their soveraign
at this day in all the [[world]]: wherein whilest they needlessely [[think]] to
justifie themselves, they justifie all the successefull rebellions that
ambition shall at any [[time]] raise against them, and their successors.
therefore i put down for one of the most effectuall seeds of the death
of any [[state]], that the conquerours require not onely a submission of
mens actions to them for the future, but also an approbation of all
their actions [[past]]; when there is scarce a common-wealth in the [[world]],
whose beginnings can in [[conscience]] be justified.

and because the name of [[tyranny]], signifieth nothing more, nor lesse,
than the name of soveraignty, be it in one, or many [[men]], saving that
they that use the former word, are understood to bee angry with them
they call tyrants [[tyrant]]; i [[think]] the toleration of a professed [[hatred]] of
tyranny, is a toleration of [[hatred]] to common-wealth in general, and
another evill seed, not differing much from the former. for to the
justification of the cause of a conqueror, the reproach of the cause
of the conquered, is for the most part necessary: but neither of them
necessary for the obligation of the conquered. and thus much i have
thought fit to say upon the review of the first and second part of this
discourse.

in the 35th [[chapter]], i have sufficiently declared out of the [[scripture]],
that in the common-wealth of the jewes, [[god]] himselfe was made the
soveraign, by pact with the [[people]]; who were therefore called his
peculiar [[people]], to distinguish them from the rest of the [[world]], over
whom [[god]] reigned not by their [[consent]], but by his own [[power]]: and that
in this kingdome [[moses]] was gods lieutenant on [[earth]]; and that it was he
that told them what laws [[law]] [[god]] appointed to doe execution; especially
in capitall punishments [[punishment]]; not then thinking it a matter of so necessary
consideration, as i find it since. wee [[know]] that generally in all
common-wealths, the execution of corporeall punishments [[punishment]], was either put
upon the guards, or other souldiers of the soveraign [[power]]; or given
to those, in whom want of means, contempt of [[honour]], and hardnesse of
heart, concurred, to make them sue for such an office. but amongst the
israelites it was a positive [[law]] of [[god]] their soveraign, that he that
was convicted of a capitall crime, should be stoned to [[death]] by the
people; and that the witnesses should cast the first stone, and after
the witnesses, then the rest of the [[people]]. this was a [[law]] that designed
who were to be the executioners; but not that any one should throw a
stone at him before conviction and sentence, where the congregation
was [[judge]]. the witnesses were neverthelesse to be heard before they
proceeded to execution, unlesse the [[fact]] were committed in the presence
of the congregation it [[self]], or in sight of the lawfull judges [[judge]]; for
then there needed no other witnesses but the judges [[judge]] themselves.
neverthelesse, this manner of proceeding being not throughly understood,
hath given [[occasion]] to a dangerous [[opinion]], that any [[man]] may kill
another, is some cases, by a [[right]] of zeal; as if the executions done
upon offenders in the kingdome of [[god]] in old [[time]], proceeded not from
the soveraign command, but from the [[authority]] of private zeal: which, if
we consider the texts that seem to favour it, is quite contrary.

first, where the levites fell upon the [[people]], that had made and
worshipped the golden calfe, and slew three thousand of them; it was by
the commandement of [[moses]], from the mouth of [[god]]; as is manifest, exod.
32.27. and when the [[son]] of a woman of [[israel]] had blasphemed [[god]], they
that heard it, did not kill him, but brought him before [[moses]], who
put him under custody, till [[god]] should give sentence against him; as
appears, levit. 25.11, 12. again, (numbers 25.6, 7.) when phinehas
killed zimri and cosbi, it was not by [[right]] of private zeale: their
crime was committed in the sight of the assembly; there needed
no witnesse; the [[law]] was known, and he the heir apparent to the
soveraignty; and which is the principall point, the lawfulnesse of his
act depended wholly upon a subsequent ratification by [[moses]], whereof he
had no cause to [[doubt]]. and this presumption of a future ratification, is
sometimes necessary to the safety [of] a common-wealth; as in a sudden
rebellion, any [[man]] that can suppresse it by his own [[power]] in the
countrey where it begins, may lawfully doe it, and provide to have it
ratified, or pardoned, whilest it is in doing, or after it is done. also
numb. 35.30. it is expressely said, "whosoever shall kill the murtherer,
shall kill him upon the word of witnesses:" but witnesses suppose
a formall judicature, and consequently condemn that pretence of jus
zelotarum. the [[law]] of [[moses]] concerning him that enticeth to idolatry,
(that is to say, in the kingdome of [[god]] to a renouncing of his
allegiance) (deut. 13.8.) forbids to conceal him, and commands the
accuser to cause him to be put to [[death]], and to cast the first stone at
him; but not to kill him before he be condemned. and (deut. 17. ver.4,
5, 6.) the processe against idolatry is exactly set down: for [[god]] there
speaketh to the [[people]], as [[judge]], and commandeth them, when a [[man]] is
accused of idolatry, to enquire diligently of the [[fact]], and finding it
true, then to stone him; but still the hand of the witnesse throweth
the first stone. this is not private zeal, but publique condemnation. in
like manner when a [[father]] hath a rebellious [[son]], the [[law]] is (deut. 21.
18.) that he shall bring him before the judges [[judge]] of the town, and all the
people of the town shall stone him. lastly, by pretence of these laws
it was, that st. steven was stoned, and not by pretence of private zeal:
for before hee was carried away to execution, he had pleaded his cause
before the high [[priest]]. there is nothing in all this, nor in any other
part of the bible, to countenance executions by private zeal; which
being oftentimes but a conjunction of ignorance and passion, is against
both the [[justice]] and [[peace]] of a common-wealth.

in the 36th [[chapter]] i have said, that it is not declared in what
manner [[god]] spake supernaturally to [[moses]]: not that he spake not to him
sometimes by dreams [[dream]] and visions, and by a supernaturall voice, as
to other prophets [[prophet]]: for the manner how he spake unto him from the
mercy-seat, is expressely set down (numbers 7.89.) in these words,
"from that [[time]] forward, when [[moses]] entred into the tabernacle of the
congregation to speak with [[god]], he heard a voice which spake unto him
from over the mercy-seate, which is over the arke of the testimony, from
between the cherubins he spake unto him." but it is not declared in
what consisted the praeeminence of the manner of gods speaking to [[moses]],
above that of his speaking to other prophets [[prophet]], as to samuel, and to
abraham, to whom he also spake by a voice, (that is, by vision) unlesse
the difference consist in the cleernesse of the vision. for face
to face, and mouth to mouth, cannot be literally understood of the
infinitenesse, and incomprehensibility of the [[divine]] [[nature]].

and as to the whole doctrine, i see not yet, but the principles [[principle]] of
it are true and proper; and the ratiocination solid. for i ground the
civill [[right]] of soveraigns, and both the [[duty]] and [[liberty]] of subjects [[subject]],
upon the known naturall inclinations of [[mankind]], and upon the articles
of the [[law]] of [[nature]]; of which no [[man]], that pretends but [[reason]] enough
to govern his private [[family]], ought to be ignorant. and for the power
ecclesiasticall of the same soveraigns, i ground it on such texts, as
are both evident in themselves, and consonant to the scope of the whole
scripture. and therefore am perswaded, that he that shall [[read]] it with
a [[purpose]] onely to be informed, shall be informed by it. but for those
that by writing, or publique discourse, or by their eminent actions,
have already engaged themselves to the maintaining of contrary opinions [[opinion]],
they will not bee so easily satisfied. for in such cases, it is naturall
for [[men]], at one and the same [[time]], both to proceed in reading, and to
lose their attention, in the search of objections to that they had read
before: of which, in a [[time]] wherein the interests of [[men]] are changed
(seeing much of that doctrine, which serveth to the establishing of a
new [[government]], must needs be contrary to that which conduced to the
dissolution of the old,) there cannot choose but be very many.

in that part which treateth of a [[christian]] common-wealth, there are
some new doctrines, which, it may be, in a [[state]] where the contrary were
already fully determined, were a [[fault]] for a [[subject]] without leave to
divulge, as being an usurpation of the place of a teacher. but in this
time, that [[men]] call not onely for [[peace]], but also for [[truth]], to offer
such doctrines as i [[think]] true, and that manifestly tend to [[peace]] and
loyalty, to the consideration of those that are yet in deliberation, is
no more, but to offer new wine, to bee put into new cask, that bothe may
be preserved together. and i suppose, that then, when novelty can breed
no trouble, nor disorder in a [[state]], [[men]] are not generally so much
inclined to the reverence of antiquity, as to preferre ancient errors,
before new and well proved [[truth]].

there is nothing i distrust more than my elocution; which neverthelesse
i am confident (excepting the mischances of the presse) is not obscure.
that i have neglected the ornament of quoting ancient poets, orators,
and [[philosophers]], contrary to the custome of late [[time]], (whether i have
done well or ill in it,) proceedeth from my [[judgment]], grounded on many
reasons. for first, all [[truth]] of doctrine dependeth either upon [[reason]],
or upon [[scripture]]; both which give credit to many, but never receive it
from any writer. secondly, the matters in [[question]] are not of [[fact]], but
of [[right]], wherein there is no place for witnesses. there is scarce any
of those old writers, that contradicteth not sometimes both himself,
and others; which makes their testimonies insufficient. fourthly,
such opinions [[opinion]] as are taken onely upon credit of antiquity, are not
intrinsically the [[judgment]] of those that cite them, but words that
passe (like gaping) from mouth to mouth. fiftly, it is many times [[time]] with a
fraudulent designe that [[men]] stick their [[corrupt]] doctrine with the cloves
of other mens [[men]] wit. sixtly, i find not that the ancients they cite, took
it for an ornament, to doe the like with those that wrote before them.
seventhly, it is an argument of indigestion, when [[greek]] and latine
sentences unchewed come up again, as they use to doe, unchanged. lastly,
though i reverence those [[men]] of ancient [[time]], that either have written
truth perspicuously, or set us in a [[better]] way to find it out our
selves; yet to the antiquity it [[self]] i [[think]] nothing due: for if we will
reverence the [[age]], the [[present]] is the oldest. if the antiquity of the
writer, i am not sure, that generally they to whom such [[honor]] is given,
were more ancient when they wrote, than i am that am writing: but if it
bee well considered, the [[praise]] of ancient authors, proceeds not from
the reverence of the [[dead]], but from the competition, and mutuall envy of
the living.

to conclude, there is nothing in this whole discourse, nor in that i
writ before of the same [[subject]] in latine, as far as i can perceive,
contrary either to the word of [[god]], or to [[good]] manners; or to the
disturbance of the publique tranquillity. therefore i [[think]] it may be
profitably printed, and more profitably taught in the universities [[university]], in
case they also [[think]] so, to whom the [[judgment]] of the same belongeth.
for seeing the universities [[university]] are the fountains of civill, and morall
doctrine, from whence the preachers, and the gentry, drawing such water
as they find, use to sprinkle the same (both from the pulpit, and in
their conversation) upon the [[people]], there ought certainly to be
great [[care]] taken, to have it pure, both from the venime of heathen
politicians, and from the incantation of deceiving spirits. and by that
means the most [[men]], knowing their duties [[duty]], will be the less [[subject]] to
serve the [[ambition]] of a few discontented persons [[person]], in their purposes
against the [[state]]; and be the lesse [[grieved]] with the contributions
necessary for their [[peace]], and defence; and the governours themselves
have the lesse cause, to maintain at the [[common]] charge any greater
army, than is necessary to make [[good]] the publique [[liberty]], against the
invasions and encroachments of forraign enemies [[enemy]].

and thus i have brought to an end my discourse of civill and
ecclesiasticall [[government]], occasioned by the disorders of the present
time, without partiality, without application, and without other
designe, than to set before mens [[men]] [[eyes]] the mutuall relation between
protection and [[obedience]]; of which the condition of humane [[nature]], and
the laws [[law]] [[divine]], (both naturall and positive) require an inviolable
observation. and though in the [[revolution]] of states, there can be no
very [[good]] constellation for truths [[truth]] of this [[nature]] to be born under, (as
having an angry aspect from the dissolvers of an old [[government]], and
seeing but the backs of them that erect a new;) yet i cannot think
it will be condemned at this [[time]], either by the publique [[judge]] of
doctrine, or by any that desires [[desire]] the continuance of publique [[peace]]. and
in this [[hope]] i return to my interrupted speculation of bodies [[body]] naturall;
wherein, (if [[god]] give me health to finish it,) i [[hope]] the novelty will
as much please, as in the doctrine of this artificiall [[body]] it useth to
offend. for such [[truth]], as opposeth no [[man]] [[profit]], nor [[pleasure]], is to
all [[men]] welcome.
