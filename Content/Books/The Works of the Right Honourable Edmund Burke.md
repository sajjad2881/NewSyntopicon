that the least informed reader of this [[speech]] may be enabled to enter
fully into the spirit of the transaction on [[occasion]] of which it was
delivered, it may be proper to acquaint him, that, among the princes
dependent on this nation in the southern part of [[india]], the most
considerable at [[present]] is commonly known by the title of the nabob of
arcot.

this [[prince]] owed the establishment of his [[government]], against the claims
of his elder [[brother]], as well as those of other competitors, to the arms
and influence of the british east [[india]] company. being thus established
in a considerable part of the dominions he now possesses, he began,
about the year 1765, to form, at the instigation (as he asserts) of the
servants of the east [[india]] company, a variety of designs for the further
extension of his territories. some years after, he carried his views to
certain objects of interior arrangement, of a very pernicious [[nature]].
none of these designs could be compassed without the aid of the
company's arms; nor could those arms be employed consistently with an
obedience to the company's orders. he was therefore advised to form a
more secret, but an equally powerful, interest among the servants of
that company, and among others both at [[home]] and abroad. by engaging them
in his interests, the use of the company's [[power]] might be obtained
without their ostensible [[authority]]; the [[power]] might even be employed in
defiance of the [[authority]], if the case should require, as in [[truth]] it
often did require, a proceeding of that [[degree]] of boldness.

the company had put him into possession of several [[great]] cities [[city]] and
magnificent castles. the [[good]] order of his affairs, his sense of
personal [[dignity]], his ideas [[idea]] of oriental splendor, and the habits of an
asiatic [[life]], (to which, being a native of [[india]], and a mahometan, he
had from his infancy been inured,) would naturally have [[led]] him to fix
the seat of his [[government]] within his own dominions. instead of this, he
totally sequestered himself from his [[country]], and, abandoning all
appearance of [[state]], he took up his residence in an ordinary house,
which he purchased in the suburbs of the company's factory at madras. in
that place he has lived, without removing one day from thence, for
several years [[past]]. he has there continued a constant cabal with the
company's servants, from the highest to the lowest,--creating, out of
the ruins of the [[country]], brilliant fortunes [[fortune]] for those who will, and
entirely destroying those who will not, be subservient to his purposes [[purpose]].

an [[opinion]] prevailed, strongly confirmed by several passages in his own
letters, as well as by a combination of circumstances forming a [[body]] of
evidence which cannot be resisted, that very [[great]] sums have been by him
distributed, through a long course of years, to some of the company's
servants. besides these presumed payments in ready [[money]], (of which,
from the [[nature]] of the thing, the direct proof is very difficult,) debts
have at several periods been acknowledged to those gentlemen, to an
immense amount,--that is, to some millions of sterling [[money]]. there is
strong [[reason]] to suspect that the [[body]] of these debts is wholly
fictitious, and was never created by [[money]] _bonâ fide_ lent. but even on
a supposition that this vast sum was really advanced, it was impossible
that the very reality of such an astonishing transaction should not
cause some [[degree]] of alarm and incite to some sort of inquiry.

it was not at all seemly, at a moment when the company itself was so
distressed as to require a suspension, by act of [[parliament]], of the
payment of bills drawn on them from [[india]],--and also a direct tax upon
every house in [[england]], in order to facilitate the vent of their goods [[good]],
and to avoid instant insolvency,--at that very moment, that their
servants should appear in so flourishing a condition, as, besides ten
millions of other demands on their masters, to be entitled to claim a
debt of three or four millions more from the territorial [[revenue]] of one
of their dependent princes [[prince]].

the ostensible pecuniary transactions of the nabob of arcot with very
private persons [[person]] are so enormous, that they evidently set aside every
pretence of policy which might induce a prudent [[government]] in some
instances to wink at ordinary loose practice in ill-managed departments.
no caution could be too [[great]] in handling this matter, no scrutiny too
exact. it was evidently the interest, and as evidently at least in the
power, of the creditors, by admitting secret participation in this dark
and undefined concern, to spread [[corruption]] to the [[greatest]] and the most
alarming extent.

these facts [[fact]] relative to the debts were so notorious, the [[opinion]] of
their being a principal source of the disorders of the british
government in [[india]] was so undisputed and universal, that there was no
party, no description of [[men]] in [[parliament]], who did not [[think]] themselves
bound, if not in [[honor]] and [[conscience]], at least in [[common]] decency, to
institute a vigorous inquiry into the very bottom of the [[business]],
before they admitted any part of that vast and suspicious charge to be
laid upon an exhausted [[country]]. every plan concurred in directing such
an inquiry, in order that whatever was discovered to be [[corrupt]],
fraudulent, or oppressive should lead to a due animadversion on the
offenders, and, if anything [[fair]] and equitable in its origin should be
found, (nobody suspected that much, comparatively speaking, would be so
found,) it might be provided for,--in due subordination, however, to the
ease of the [[subject]] and the service of the [[state]].

these were the alleged grounds for an inquiry, settled in all the bills
brought into [[parliament]] relative to [[india]],--and there were, i [[think]], no
less than four of them. by the bill commonly called mr. pitt's bill, the
inquiry was specially, and by express words, committed to the court of
directors, without any reserve for the interference of any other person
or persons [[person]] whatsoever. it was ordered that _they_ should make the
inquiry into the origin and [[justice]] of these debts, as far as the
materials in _their_ possession enabled them to proceed; and where
_they_ found those materials deficient, _they_ should order the
presidency of fort st. george (madras) to complete the inquiry.

the court of directors applied themselves to the execution of the trust
reposed in them. they first examined into the amount of the debt, which
they computed, at compound interest, to be 2,945,600_l._ sterling.
whether their mode of computation, either of the original sums or the
amount on compound interest, was exact, that is, whether they took the
interest too high or the several capitals too low, is not material. on
whatever [[principle]] any of the calculations were made up, none of them
found the debt to differ from the recital of the act, which asserted
that the sums claimed were "_very_ large." the [[last]] head of these debts
the directors compute at 2,465,680_l._ sterling. of the existence of
this debt the directors heard nothing until 1776, and they say, that,
"although they had _repeatedly_ written to the nabob of arcot, and to
their servants, respecting the debt, yet they _had never been able to
trace the origin thereof, or to obtain any satisfactory information on
the subject_."

the court of directors, after stating the circumstances under which the
debts appeared to them to have been contracted, add as follows:--"for
these reasons [[reason]] we should have [[thought]] it our [[duty]] to inquire _very
minutely_ into those debts, even if the act of [[parliament]] had been
silent on the [[subject]], before we concurred in any measure for their
payment. but with the positive injunctions of the act before us to
examine into their [[nature]] and origin, we are indispensably bound to
direct such an inquiry to be instituted." they then order the president
and council of madras to enter into a full examination, &c., &c.

the directors, having drawn up their order to the presidency on these
principles, communicated the draught of the general letter in which
those orders were contained to the board of his majesty's ministers, and
other servants lately constituted by mr. pitt's east [[india]] act. these
ministers, who had just carried through [[parliament]] the bill ordering a
specific inquiry, immediately drew up another letter, on a principle
directly opposite to that which was prescribed by the act of parliament
and followed by the directors. in these second orders, all [[idea]] of an
inquiry into the [[justice]] and origin of the pretended debts, particularly
of the [[last]], the [[greatest]], and the most obnoxious to suspicion, is
abandoned. they are all admitted and established without any
investigation whatsoever, (except some private conference with the
agents of the claimants is to pass for an investigation,) and a fund for
their discharge is assigned and set apart out of the revenues [[revenue]] of the
carnatic. to this arrangement in favor of their servants, servants
suspected of [[corruption]] and convicted of disobedience, the directors of
the east [[india]] company were ordered to set their hands, asserting it to
arise from their own conviction and [[opinion]], in flat contradiction to
their recorded sentiments, their [[strong]] remonstrance, and their declared
sense of their [[duty]], as well under their general trust and their oath as
directors, as under the express injunctions of an act of [[parliament]].

the principles [[principle]] upon which this summary proceeding was adopted by the
ministerial board are stated by themselves in a number in the appendix
to this [[speech]].

by another section of the same act, the same court of directors were
ordered to take into consideration and to decide on the indeterminate
rights of the rajah of tanjore and the nabob of arcot; and in this, as
in the former case, no [[power]] of appeal, revision, or alteration was
reserved to any other. it was a jurisdiction, in a cause between party
and party, given to the court of directors specifically. it was known
that the territories of the former of these princes [[prince]] had been twice
invaded and pillaged, and the [[prince]] deposed and imprisoned, by the
company's servants, influenced by the intrigues of the latter, and for
the [[purpose]] of paying his pretended debts. the company had, in the year
1775, ordered a restoration of the rajah to his [[government]], under
certain conditions. the rajah complained, that his territories had not
been completely restored to him, and that no part of his goods [[good]], [[money]],
revenues, or records, unjustly taken and withheld from him, were ever
returned. the nabob, on the other hand, never ceased to claim the
country itself, and carried on a continued train of negotiation, that it
should again be given up to him, in violation of the company's public
faith.

the directors, in [[obedience]] to this part of the act, ordered an inquiry,
and came to a determination to restore [[certain]] of his territories to the
rajah. the ministers, proceeding as in the former case, without hearing
any party, rescinded the decision of the directors, refused the
restitution of the territory, and, without regard to the condition of
the [[country]] of tanjore, which had been within a few years four times
plundered, (twice by the nabob of arcot, and twice by enemies [[enemy]] brought
upon it solely by the [[politics]] of the same nabob, the declared [[enemy]] of
that [[people]],) and without discounting a shilling for their sufferings,
they accumulate an arrear of about four hundred thousand pounds of
pretended tribute to this [[enemy]]; and then they order the directors to
put their hands to a new adjudication, directly contrary to a judgment
in a judicial [[character]] and trust solemnly given by them and entered on
their records.

these proceedings naturally called for some inquiry. on the 28th of
february, 1785, mr. fox made the following motion in the house of
commons, after moving that the clauses of the act should be [[read]]:--"that
the proper officer do lay before this house copies or extracts of all
letters and orders of the court of directors of the [[united]] east india
company, in pursuance of the injunctions contained in the 37th and 38th
clauses of the said act"; and the [[question]] being put, it passed in the
negative by a very [[great]] majority.

the [[last]] [[speech]] in the debate was the following; which is given to the
public, not as being more worthy of its attention than others, (some of
which were of consummate ability,) but as entering more into the detail
of the [[subject]].




speech.


the times [[time]] we [[live]] in, mr. speaker, have been distinguished by
extraordinary events. habituated, however, as we are, to uncommon
combinations of [[men]] and of affairs, i [[believe]] nobody recollects anything
more surprising than the spectacle of this day. the [[right]] honorable
gentleman[1] whose conduct is now in [[question]] formerly stood forth in
this house, the prosecutor of the worthy baronet[2] who spoke after him.
he charged him with several grievous acts of malversation in office,
with abuses [[abuse]] of a [[public]] trust of a [[great]] and heinous [[nature]]. in less
than two years we see the situation of the parties reversed; and a
singular [[revolution]] puts the worthy baronet in a [[fair]] way of returning
the prosecution in a recriminatory bill of pains [[pain]] and penalties, grounded
on a breach of [[public]] trust relative to the [[government]] of the very same
part of [[india]]. if he should undertake a bill of that [[kind]], he will find
no difficulty in conducting it with a [[degree]] of [[skill]] and vigor fully
equal to all that have been exerted against him.

but the [[change]] of relation between these two gentlemen is not so
striking as the total difference of their deportment under the same
unhappy circumstances. whatever the merits [[merit]] of the worthy baronet's
defence might have been, he did not shrink from the charge. he met it
with manliness of spirit and decency of behavior. what would have been
thought of him, if he had held the [[present]] [[language]] of his old accuser?
when articles were exhibited against him by that [[right]] honorable
gentleman, he did not [[think]] proper to tell the house that we ought to
institute no inquiry, to inspect no paper, to examine no witness. he did
not tell us (what at that [[time]] he might have told us with some show of
reason) that our concerns in [[india]] were matters of delicacy, that to
divulge anything relative to them would be mischievous to the [[state]]. he
did not tell us that those who would inquire into his proceedings were
disposed to dismember the [[empire]]. he had not the presumption to say,
that, for his part, having obtained, in his [[indian]] presidency, the
ultimate object of his [[ambition]], his [[honor]] was concerned in executing
with integrity the trust which had been legally committed to his charge:
that others, not having been so fortunate, could not be so
disinterested; and therefore their accusations could spring from no
other source than faction, and envy to his [[fortune]].

had he been frontless enough to hold such [[vain]], vaporing [[language]] in the
face of a grave, a detailed, a specified matter of accusation, whilst he
violently resisted everything which could bring the merits [[merit]] of his cause
to the test,--had he been wild enough to anticipate the absurdities of
this day,--that is, had he inferred, as his late accuser has thought
proper to do, that he could not have been guilty of malversation in
office, for this sole and [[curious]] [[reason]], that he had been in
office,--had he argued the impossibility of his abusing his [[power]] on
this sole [[principle]], that he had [[power]] to [[abuse]],--he would have left
but one impression on the [[mind]] of every [[man]] who heard him, and who
believed him in his senses: that in the utmost extent he was guilty of
the charge.

but, sir, leaving these two gentlemen to alternate as [[criminal]] and
accuser upon what principles [[principle]] they [[think]] expedient, it is for us to
consider whether the chancellor of the exchequer and the treasurer of
the navy, acting as a board of control, are justified by [[law]] or policy
in suspending the legal arrangements made by the court of directors, in
order to transfer the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]] to the private emolument of
certain servants of the east [[india]] company, without the inquiry into the
origin and [[justice]] of their claims prescribed by an act of [[parliament]].

it is not contended that the act of [[parliament]] did not expressly ordain
an inquiry. it is not asserted that this inquiry was not, with equal
precision of terms, specially committed, under particular regulations,
to the court of directors. i conceive, therefore, the board of control
had no [[right]] whatsoever to intermeddle in that [[business]]. there is
nothing [[certain]] in the principles [[principle]] of jurisprudence, if this be not
undeniably true, that when, a special [[authority]] is given to any persons
by name to do some particular act, that no others, by [[virtue]] of general
powers, can obtain a legal title to intrude themselves into that trust,
and to exercise those special functions in their place. i therefore
consider the intermeddling of ministers in this affair as a downright
usurpation. but if the strained construction by which they have forced
themselves into a suspicious office (which every [[man]] delicate with
regard to [[character]] would rather have sought constructions to avoid)
were perfectly sound and perfectly legal, of this i am [[certain]], that
they cannot be justified in declining the inquiry which had been
prescribed to the court of directors. if the board of control did
lawfully possess the [[right]] of executing the special trust given to that
court, they must take it as they found it, [[subject]] to the very same
regulations which bound the court of directors. it will be allowed that
the court of directors had no [[authority]] to dispense with either the
substance or the mode of inquiry prescribed by the act of [[parliament]]. if
they had not, where in the act did the board of control acquire that
capacity? indeed, it was impossible they should acquire it. what must we
think of the fabric and texture of an act of [[parliament]] which should
find it necessary to prescribe a strict inquisition, that should descend
into minute regulations for the conduct of that inquisition, that should
commit this trust to a particular description of [[men]], and in the very
same breath should enable another [[body]], at their own [[pleasure]], to
supersede all the provisions the legislature had made, and to defeat the
whole [[purpose]], end, and object of the [[law]]? this cannot be supposed even
of an act of [[parliament]] conceived by the ministers themselves, and
brought forth during the delirium of the [[last]] session.

my honorable friend has told you in the [[speech]] which introduced his
motion, that fortunately this [[question]] is not a [[great]] deal involved in
the labyrinths of [[indian]] detail. certainly not. but if it were, i beg
leave to assure you that there is nothing in the [[indian]] detail which is
more difficult than in the detail of any other [[business]]. i admit,
because i have some [[experience]] of the [[fact]], that for the interior
regulation of [[india]] a minute [[knowledge]] of [[india]] is requisite. but on
any specific matter of delinquency in its [[government]] you are as capable
of judging as if the same thing were done at your door. fraud,
injustice, oppression, peculation, engendered in [[india]], are crimes of
the same [[blood]], [[family]], and cast with those that are born and bred in
england. to go no farther than the case before us: you are just as
competent to [[judge]] whether the sum of four millions sterling ought or
ought not to be passed from the [[public]] treasury into a private pocket
without any title except the claim of the parties, when the issue of
fact is laid in madras, as when it is laid in westminster. terms of art [[arts]],
indeed, are different in different places; but they are generally
understood in none. the technical style of an [[indian]] treasury is not one
jot more remote than the jargon of our own exchequer from the train of
our ordinary ideas [[idea]] or the idiom of our [[common]] [[language]]. the difference,
therefore, in the two cases is not in the comparative difficulty or
facility of the two subjects [[subject]], but in our attention to the one and our
total neglect of the other. had this attention and neglect been
regulated by the value of the several objects, there would be nothing to
complain of. but the reverse of that supposition is true. the scene of
the [[indian]] [[abuse]] is distant, indeed; but we must not infer that the
value of our interest in it is decreased in proportion as it recedes
from our view. in our [[politics]], as in our [[common]] conduct, we shall be
worse than infants, if we do not put our senses under the tuition of our
judgment, and effectually cure ourselves of that optical illusion which
makes a brier at our nose of greater magnitude than an oak at five
hundred yards' distance.

i [[think]] i can trace all the calamities of this [[country]] to the single
source of our not having had steadily before our [[eyes]] a general,
comprehensive, well-connected, and well-proportioned view of the whole
of our dominions, and a just sense of their true bearings and relations.
after all its reductions, the british [[empire]] is still vast and various.
after all the reductions of the house of commons [[common]], (stripped as we are of
our brightest ornaments and of our most important privileges [[privilege]],) enough
are yet left to furnish us, if we please, with means of showing to the
world that we deserve the superintendence of as large an [[empire]] as this
kingdom ever held, and the continuance of as ample privileges [[privilege]] as the
house of commons [[common]], in the plenitude of its [[power]], had been habituated to
assert. but if we make ourselves too little for the sphere of our [[duty]],
if, on the contrary, we do not stretch and expand our minds [[mind]] to the
compass of their object, be well assured that everything about us will
dwindle by degrees [[degree]], until at length our concerns are shrunk to the
dimensions of our minds [[mind]]. it is not a predilection to mean, sordid,
home-bred cares [[care]] that will avert the consequences of a false estimation
of our interest, or prevent the shameful dilapidation into which a great
empire must fall by mean reparations upon mighty ruins.

i confess i [[feel]] a [[degree]] of disgust, almost leading to despair, at the
manner in which we are acting in the [[great]] exigencies of our [[country]].
there is now a bill in this house appointing a rigid inquisition into
the minutest detail of our offices at [[home]]. the collection of sixteen
millions annually, a collection on which the [[public]] greatness, safety,
and credit have their reliance, the whole order of criminal
jurisprudence, which holds together [[society]] itself, have at no time
obliged us to call forth such powers [[power]],--no, nor anything like them. there
is not a [[principle]] of the [[law]] and [[constitution]] of this [[country]] that is
not subverted to favor the execution of that project.[3] and for what is
all this apparatus of bustle and terror? is it because anything
substantial is expected from it? no. the stir and bustle itself is the
end proposed. the eye-servants of a short-sighted master will employ
themselves, not on what is most essential to his affairs, but on what is
nearest to his ken. [[great]] difficulties have given a just value to
economy; and our minister of the day must be an economist, whatever it
may cost us. but where is he to exert his [[talents]]? at [[home]], to be sure;
for where else can he obtain a profitable credit for their exertion? it
is nothing to him, whether the object on which he works [[work]] under our eye be
promising or not. if he does not obtain any [[public]] benefit, he may make
regulations without end. those are sure to [[pay]] in [[present]] expectation,
whilst the effect is at a distance, and may be the concern of other
times and other [[men]]. on these principles [[principle]], he chooses to suppose (for he
does not pretend more than to suppose) a naked possibility that he shall
draw some resource out of crumbs dropped from the trenchers of penury;
that something shall be laid in store from the short allowance of
revenue-officers overloaded with [[duty]] and famished for want of
bread,--by a reduction from officers who are at this very hour ready to
batter the treasury with what breaks through stone walls for an
_increase_ of their appointments. from the marrowless bones of these
skeleton establishments, by the use of every sort of cutting and of
every sort of fretting tool, he flatters himself that he may chip and
rasp an empirical alimentary powder, to diet into some similitude of
health and substance the languishing chimeras of fraudulent reformation.

whilst he is thus employed according to his policy and to his taste, he
has not leisure to inquire into those abuses [[abuse]] in [[india]] that are drawing
off [[money]] by millions from the treasures of this [[country]], which are
exhausting the vital juices from members of the [[state]], where the public
inanition is far more sorely [[felt]] than in the local exchequer of
england. not content with winking at these abuses [[abuse]], whilst he attempts to
squeeze the laborious, ill-paid drudges of english [[revenue]], he lavishes,
in one act of [[corrupt]] prodigality, upon those who never served the
public in any honest occupation at all, an annual income [[equal]] to two
thirds of the whole collection of the revenues [[revenue]] of this [[kingdom]].

actuated by the same [[principle]] of [[choice]], he has now on the anvil
another scheme, full of difficulty and desperate hazard, which totally
alters the commercial relation of two kingdoms [[kingdom]], and, what end soever it
shall have, may bequeath a legacy of heartburning and discontent to one
of the countries [[country]], perhaps to both, to be perpetuated to the latest
posterity. this project is also undertaken on the [[hope]] of [[profit]]. it is
provided, that, out of some (i [[know]] not what) remains of the irish
hereditary [[revenue]], a fund, at some [[time]], and of some sort, should be
applied to the protection of the irish [[trade]]. here we are commanded
again to task our [[faith]], and to persuade ourselves, that, out of the
surplus of deficiency, out of the savings of habitual and systematic
prodigality, the minister of wonders will provide support for this
nation, sinking under the mountainous load of two hundred and thirty
millions of debt. but whilst we look with [[pain]] at his desperate and
laborious trifling, whilst we are apprehensive that he will break his
back in stooping to pick up chaff and straws, he recovers himself at an
elastic bound, and with a broadcast swing of his arm he squanders over
his [[indian]] field a sum far greater than the clear [[produce]] of the whole
hereditary [[revenue]] of the [[kingdom]] of ireland.[4]

strange as this scheme of conduct in ministry is, and inconsistent with
all just policy, it is still true to itself, and faithful to its own
perverted order. those who are bountiful to crimes will be rigid to
merit and penurious to service. their penury is even held out as a blind
and cover to their prodigality. the economy of [[injustice]] is to furnish
resources for the fund of [[corruption]]. then they [[pay]] off their protection
to [[great]] crimes and [[great]] criminals [[criminal]] by being inexorable to the paltry
frailties of little [[men]]; and these [[modern]] flagellants are sure, with a
rigid fidelity, to whip their own enormities on the vicarious back of
every small offender.

it is to draw your attention to economy of quite another order, it is to
animadvert on offences of a far different description, that my honorable
friend has brought before you the motion of this day. it is to
perpetuate the abuses [[abuse]] which are subverting the fabric of your [[empire]],
that the motion is opposed. it is, therefore, with [[reason]] (and if he has
power to carry himself through, i commend his prudence) that the right
honorable gentleman makes his stand at the very outset, and boldly
refuses all parliamentary information. let him admit but one step
towards inquiry, and he is undone. you must be ignorant, or he cannot be
safe. but before his curtain is let down, and the shades of eternal
night shall veil our eastern dominions from our view, permit me, sir, to
avail myself of the means which were furnished in anxious and
inquisitive times [[time]] to demonstrate out of this [[single]] act of the present
minister what advantages you are to derive from permitting the greatest
concern of this nation to be separated from the cognizance, and exempted
even out of the competence, of [[parliament]]. the [[greatest]] [[body]] of your
revenue, your most numerous armies [[army]], your most important commerce, the
richest sources of your [[public]] credit, (contrary to every [[idea]] of the
known, settled policy of [[england]],) are on the point of being converted
into a mystery of [[state]]. you are going to have one half of the globe hid
even from the [[common]] liberal curiosity of an english gentleman. here a
grand [[revolution]] commences. mark the period, and mark the circumstances.
in most of the [[capital]] changes [[change]] that are recorded in the principles [[principle]] and
system of any [[government]], a [[public]] benefit of some [[kind]] or other has
been pretended. the [[revolution]] commenced in something plausible, in
something which carried the appearance at least of [[punishment]] of
delinquency or correction of [[abuse]]. but here, in the very moment of the
conversion of a department of british [[government]] into an [[indian]] mystery,
and in the very act in which the [[change]] commences, a [[corrupt]] private
interest is set up in direct opposition to the necessities of the
nation. a diversion is made of millions of the [[public]] [[money]] from the
public treasury to a private purse. it is not into secret negotiations
for [[war]], [[peace]], or [[alliance]] that the house of commons [[common]] is forbidden to
inquire. it is a matter of account; it is a pecuniary transaction; it is
the demand of a suspected steward upon ruined tenants and an embarrassed
master that the commons [[common]] of [[great]] [[britain]] are commanded not to inspect.
the whole tenor of the [[right]] honorable gentleman's argument is consonant
to the [[nature]] of his policy. the [[system]] of concealment is fostered by a
system of falsehood. false facts [[fact]], false colors, false names of persons
and things, are its whole support.

sir, i mean to [[follow]] the [[right]] honorable gentleman over that field of
deception, clearing what he has purposely obscured, and fairly stating
what it was necessary for him to misrepresent. for this [[purpose]], it is
necessary you should [[know]], with some [[degree]] of distinctness, a little of
the locality, the [[nature]], the circumstances, the magnitude of the
pretended debts on which this marvellous donation is founded, as well as
of the persons [[person]] from whom and by whom it is claimed.

madras, with its dependencies, is the second (but with a long interval,
the second) member of the british [[empire]] in the east. the [[trade]] of that
city, and of the adjacent territory, was not very long ago among the
most flourishing in [[asia]]. but since the establishment of the british
power it has wasted away under an uniform gradual decline, insomuch that
in the year 1779 not one merchant of eminence was to be found in the
whole [[country]].[5] during this period of decay, about six hundred
thousand sterling pounds a year have been drawn off by english gentlemen
on their private account, by the way of [[china]] alone.[6] if we add four
hundred thousand, as probably remitted through other channels, and in
other mediums, that is, in jewels, gold, and silver, directly brought to
europe, and in bills upon the british and [[foreign]] companies, you will
scarcely [[think]] the matter overrated. if we fix the commencement of this
extraction of [[money]] from the carnatic at a period no earlier than the
year 1760, and close it in the year 1780, it probably will not amount to
a [[great]] deal less than twenty millions of [[money]].

during the deep, silent flow of this steady stream of [[wealth]] which set
from [[india]] into [[europe]], it generally passed on with no adequate
observation; but happening at some periods to meet rifts of rocks that
checked its course, it grew more noisy and attracted more notice. the
pecuniary discussions caused by an accumulation of part of the fortunes
of their servants in a debt from the nabob of arcot was the first thing
which very particularly called for, and long engaged, the attention of
the court of directors. this debt amounted to eight hundred and eighty
thousand pounds sterling, and was claimed, for the greater part, by
english gentlemen residing at madras. this grand [[capital]], settled at
length by order at ten per cent, afforded an annuity of eighty-eight
thousand pounds.[7]

whilst the directors were digesting their astonishment at this
information, a memorial was presented to them from three gentlemen,
informing them that their [[friends]] had lent, likewise, to merchants of
canton in [[china]], a sum of not more than one million sterling. in this
memorial they called upon the company for their assistance and
interposition with the chinese [[government]] for the recovery of the debt.
this sum lent to chinese merchants was at twenty-four per cent, which
would yield, if paid, an annuity of two hundred and forty thousand
pounds.[8]

perplexed as the directors were with these demands, you may conceive,
sir, that they did not find themselves very much disembarrassed by being
made acquainted that they must again exert their influence for a new
reserve of the [[happy]] parsimony of their servants, collected into a
second debt from the nabob of arcot, amounting to two millions four
hundred thousand pounds, settled at an interest of twelve per cent. this
is known by the name of the consolidation of 1777, as the former of the
nabob's debts was by the title of the consolidation of 1767. to this was
added, in a separate parcel, a little reserve, called the cavalry debt,
of one hundred and sixty thousand pounds, at the same interest. the
whole of these four capitals, amounting to four millions four hundred
and forty thousand pounds, produced at their several rates, annuities
amounting to six hundred and twenty-three thousand pounds a year: a good
deal more than one third of the clear land-tax of [[england]], at four
shillings in the pound; a [[good]] deal more than double the whole annual
dividend of the east [[india]] company, the nominal masters to the
proprietors in these funds. of this interest, three hundred and
eighty-three thousand two hundred pounds a year stood chargeable on the
public revenues [[revenue]] of the carnatic.

sir, at this moment, it will not be necessary to consider the various
operations which the [[capital]] and interest of this debt have successively
undergone. i shall speak to these operations when i come particularly to
answer the [[right]] honorable gentleman on each of the heads, as he has
thought proper to divide them. but this was the exact view in which
these debts first appeared to the court of directors, and to the [[world]].
it varied afterwards. but it never appeared in any other than a most
questionable shape. when this gigantic phantom of debt first appeared
before a [[young]] minister, it naturally would have justified some degree
of [[doubt]] and apprehension. such a prodigy would have filled any common
man with [[superstitious]] fears [[fear]]. he would exorcise that shapeless, nameless
form, and by everything [[sacred]] would have adjured it to tell by what
means a small number of slight individuals [[individual]], of no consequence or
situation, possessed of no lucrative offices, without the command of
armies or the known administration of revenues [[revenue]], without profession of
any [[kind]], without any sort of [[trade]] sufficient to employ a peddler,
could have, in a few years, (as to some, even in a few months,) amassed
treasures [[equal]] to the revenues [[revenue]] of a respectable [[kingdom]]? was it not
enough to put these gentlemen, in the novitiate of their administration,
on their guard, and to call upon them for a strict inquiry, (if not to
justify them in a reprobation of those demands without any inquiry at
all,) that, when all [[england]], [[scotland]], and ireland had for years been
witness to the immense sums laid out by the servants of the company in
stocks of all denominations, in the purchase of lands [[land]], in the buying and
building of houses, in the securing quiet seats in [[parliament]] or in the
tumultuous riot of contested elections, in wandering throughout the
whole range of those variegated modes of inventive prodigality which
sometimes have excited our wonder, sometimes roused our indignation,
that, after all, [[india]] was four millions still in debt to _them_? india
in debt to _them_! for what? every debt, for which an equivalent of some
kind or other is not given, is, on the face of it, a fraud. what is the
equivalent they have given? what equivalent had they to give? what are
the articles of commerce, or the branches of manufacture, which those
gentlemen have carried hence to enrich [[india]]? what are the sciences [[science]] they
beamed out to enlighten it? what are the [[arts]] they introduced to cheer
and to adorn it? what are the [[religious]], what the [[moral]] institutions
they have taught among that [[people]], as a guide to [[life]], or as a
consolation when [[life]] is to be no more, that there is an eternal debt, a
debt "still paying, still to owe," which must be bound on the present
generation in [[india]], and entailed on their mortgaged [[posterity]] forever?
a debt of millions, in favor of a set of [[men]] whose names, with few
exceptions, are either buried in the obscurity of their origin and
talents or dragged into [[light]] by the enormity of their crimes!

in my [[opinion]] the [[courage]] of the minister was the most wonderful part of
the transaction, especially as he must have [[read]], or rather the right
honorable gentleman says he has [[read]] for him, whole volumes upon the
subject. the volumes, by the way, are not by one tenth part so numerous
as the [[right]] honorable gentleman has [[thought]] proper to pretend, in order
to frighten you from inquiry; but in these volumes, such as they are,
the minister must have found a full [[authority]] for a suspicion (at the
very least) of everything relative to the [[great]] fortunes [[fortune]] made at madras.
what is that [[authority]]? why, no other than the standing [[authority]] for
all the claims which the ministry has [[thought]] fit to provide for,--the
grand debtor,--the nabob of arcot himself. hear that [[prince]], in the
letter written to the court of directors, at the precise period whilst
the main [[body]] of these debts were contracting. in his letter he states
himself to be, what undoubtedly he is, a most competent witness to this
point. after speaking of the [[war]] with hyder ali in 1768 and 1769, and of
other measures which he censures, (whether [[right]] or [[wrong]] it signifies
nothing,) and into which he says he had been [[led]] by the company's
servants, he proceeds in this manner:--"if all these things were against
the real interests of the company, they are ten thousand times [[time]] more
against mine, and against the [[prosperity]] of my [[country]] and the happiness
of my [[people]]; for your interests and mine are the same. _what were they
owing to, then? to the private views of a few individuals [[individual]], who have
enriched themselves at the expense of your influence and of my [[country]]:
for your servants have no [[trade]] in this [[country]], neither do you [[pay]] them
high wages; yet in a few years they return to [[england]] with many lacs of
pagodas. how can you or i account for such immense fortunes [[fortune]] acquired in
so short a [[time]], without any visible means of getting them?_"

when he [[asked]] this [[question]], which involves its [[answer]], it is
extraordinary that curiosity did not prompt the chancellor of the
exchequer to that inquiry which might come in [[vain]] recommended to him by
his own act of [[parliament]]. does not the nabob of arcot tell us, in so
many words, that there was no [[fair]] way of making the enormous sums sent
by the company's servants to [[england]]? and do you imagine that there was
or could be more honesty and [[good]] [[faith]] in the demands for what remained
behind in [[india]]? of what [[nature]] were the transactions with himself? if
you [[follow]] the train of his information, you must see, that, if these
great sums were at all lent, it was not [[property]], but spoil, that was
lent; if not lent, the transaction was not a contract, but a fraud.
either way, if [[light]] enough could not be furnished to authorize a full
condemnation of these demands, they ought to have been left to the
parties, who [[best]] knew and understood each other's proceedings. it was
not necessary that the [[authority]] of [[government]] should interpose in favor
of claims whose very foundation was a defiance of that [[authority]], and
whose object and end was its entire subversion.

it may be said that this letter was written by the nabob of arcot in a
moody humor, under the influence of some chagrin. certainly it was; but
it is in such humors that [[truth]] comes out. and when he tells you, from
his own [[knowledge]], what every one must presume, from the extreme
probability of the thing, whether he told it or not, one such testimony
is worth a thousand that contradict that probability, when the parties
have a [[better]] understanding with each other, and when they have a point
to carry that may unite them in a [[common]] deceit.

if this [[body]] of private claims of debt, real or devised, were a
question, as it is falsely pretended, between the nabob of arcot, as
debtor, and paul benfield and his associates, as creditors, i am sure i
should give myself but little trouble about it. if the hoards of
oppression were the fund for satisfying the claims of bribery and
peculation, who would [[wish]] to interfere between such litigants? if the
demands were confined to what might be drawn from the treasures which
the company's records uniformly assert that the nabob is in possession
of, or if he had mines of gold or silver or diamonds, (as we [[know]] that
he has none,) these gentlemen might break open his hoards or dig in his
mines without any disturbance from me. but the gentlemen on the other
side of the house [[know]] as well as i do, and they dare not contradict me,
that the nabob of arcot and his creditors are not adversaries, but
collusive parties, and that the whole transaction is under a false color
and false names. the litigation is not, nor ever has been, between their
rapacity and his hoarded riches [[rich]]. no: it is between him and them
combining and confederating, on one side, and the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]], and
the miserable inhabitants of a ruined [[country]], on the other. these are
the real plaintiffs and the real defendants in the suit. refusing a
shilling from his hoards for the satisfaction of any demand, the nabob
of arcot is always ready, nay, he earnestly, and with eagerness and
passion, contends for delivering up to these pretended creditors his
territory and his subjects [[subject]]. it is, therefore, not from treasuries and
mines, but from the food of your unpaid armies [[army]], from the [[blood]] withheld
from the veins and whipped out of the backs of the most miserable of
men, that we are to pamper extortion, usury, and peculation, under the
false names of debtors and creditors of [[state]].

the [[great]] patron of these creditors, (to whose [[honor]] they ought to erect
statues,) the [[right]] honorable gentleman,[9] in stating the merits [[merit]] which
recommended them to his favor, has ranked them under three grand
divisions. the first, the creditors of 1767; then the creditors of the
cavalry loan; and lastly, the creditors of the loan in 1777. let us
examine them, one by one, as they pass in review before us.

the first of these loans, that of 1767, he insists, has an indisputable
claim upon the [[public]] [[justice]]. the creditors, he affirms, lent their
money publicly; they advanced it with the express [[knowledge]] and
approbation of the company; and it was contracted at the moderate
interest of ten per cent. in this loan, the demand is, according to him,
not only just, but meritorious in a very high [[degree]]: and one would be
inclined to [[believe]] he [[thought]] so, because he has put it [[last]] in the
provision he has made for these claims.

i readily admit this debt to stand the fairest of the whole; for,
whatever may be my suspicions concerning a part of it, i can convict it
of nothing worse than the most enormous usury. but i can convict, upon
the spot, the [[right]] honorable gentleman of the most daring
misrepresentation in every one [[fact]], without any exception, that he has
alleged in defence of this loan, and of his own conduct with regard to
it. i will show you that this debt was never contracted with the
knowledge of the company; that it had not their approbation; that they
received the first [[intelligence]] of it with the utmost possible surprise,
indignation, and alarm.

so for from being previously apprised of the transaction from its
origin, it was two years before the court of directors obtained any
official [[intelligence]] of it. "the dealings of the servants with the
nabob were concealed from the first, until they were found out" (says
mr. sayer, the company's counsel) "by the report of the [[country]]." the
presidency, however, at [[last]] [[thought]] proper to send an official account.
on this the directors tell them, "to your [[great]] reproach, it has been
_concealed from us_. we cannot but suspect this debt to have had its
weight in _your proposed aggrandizement of mahomed ali_ [the nabob of
arcot]; but whether it has or has not, [[certain]] it is you are guilty of
an high breach of [[duty]] in _concealing_ it from us."

these expressions, concerning the ground of the transaction, its effect,
and its clandestine [[nature]], are in the letters bearing date march 17,
1769. after receiving a more full account, on the 23d march, 1770, they
state, that "messrs. john pybus, john call, and james bourchier, as
trustees for themselves and others of the nabob's private creditors, had
proved a deed of assignment upon the nabob and his [[son]] of fifteen
districts of the nabob's [[country]], the revenues [[revenue]] of which yielded, in time
of [[peace]], eight lacs of pagodas [320,000_l._ sterling] annually; and
likewise an assignment of the yearly tribute paid the nabob from the
rajah of tanjore, amounting to four lacs of rupees [40,000_l._]." the
territorial [[revenue]] at that [[time]] possessed by these gentlemen, without
the [[knowledge]] or [[consent]] of their masters, amounted to three hundred and
sixty thousand pounds sterling annually. they were making rapid strides
to the entire possession of the [[country]], when the directors, whom the
right honorable gentleman states as having authorized these
proceedings, were kept in such profound ignorance of this royal
acquisition of territorial [[revenue]] by their servants, that in the same
letter they say, "this assignment was obtained by _three of the members
of your board_ in january, 1767; yet we do not find the _least trace_ of
it upon your consultations until august, 1768, nor do any of your
letters to us afford any information relative to such transactions till
the 1st of november, 1768. by your [[last]] letters of the 8th of may, 1769,
you bring the whole proceedings to [[light]] in one view."

as to the previous [[knowledge]] of the company, and its sanction to the
debts, you see that this assertion of that [[knowledge]] is utterly
unfounded. but did the directors approve of it, and ratify the
transaction, when it was known? the very reverse. on the same 3d of
march, the directors declare, "upon an _impartial examination_ of the
whole conduct of our late governor and council of fort george [madras],
and on the fullest consideration, that the said governor and council
have, _in notorious violation of the trust_ reposed in them, manifestly
_preferred the interest of private individuals [[individual]] to that of the company_,
in permitting the assignment of the revenues [[revenue]] of [[certain]] valuable
districts, to a very large amount, from the nabob to individuals"; and
then, highly aggravating their crimes, they add,--"we order and direct
that you do examine, in the most [[impartial]] manner, all the
above-mentioned transactions, and that you _punish_, by suspension,
degradation, dismission, or otherwise, as to you shall seem meet, all
and every such servant or servants of the company who may by you be
found guilty of any of the above offences." "we had" (say the
directors) "the mortification to find that the servants of the company,
who had been _raised, supported, and owed their [[present]] opulence to the
advantages_ gained in such service, have in this instance most
_unfaithfully betrayed_ their trust, _abandoned_ the company's interest,
and _prostituted_ its influence to accomplish the _purposes of
individuals, whilst the interest of the company is almost wholly
neglected_, and payment to us rendered extremely precarious." here,
then, is the rock of approbation of the court of directors, on which the
right honorable gentleman says this debt was founded. any member, mr.
speaker, who should come into the house, on my reading this sentence of
condemnation of the court of directors against their unfaithful
servants, might well imagine that he had heard an harsh, severe,
unqualified invective against the [[present]] ministerial board of control.
so exactly do the proceedings of the patrons of this [[abuse]] tally with
those of the actors in it, that the expressions used in the condemnation
of the one may serve for the reprobation of the other, without the
change of a word.

to [[read]] you all the expressions of wrath and indignation fulminated in
this dispatch against the meritorious creditors of the [[right]] honorable
gentleman, who according to him have been so fully approved by the
company, would be to [[read]] the whole.

the [[right]] honorable gentleman, with an address peculiar to himself,
every now and then slides in the presidency of madras, as synonymous to
the company. that the presidency did approve the debt is [[certain]]. but
the [[right]] honorable gentleman, as prudent in suppressing as skilful in
bringing forward his matter, has not chosen to tell you that the
presidency were the very persons [[person]] guilty of contracting this
loan,--creditors themselves, and agents and trustees for all the other
creditors. for this the court of directors accuse them of breach of
trust; and for this the [[right]] honorable gentleman considers them as
perfectly [[good]] [[authority]] for those claims. it is pleasant to hear a
gentleman of the [[law]] quote the approbation of creditors as an authority
for their own debt.

how they came to contract the debt to themselves, how they came to act
as agents for those whom they ought to have controlled, is for your
inquiry. the policy of this debt was announced to the court of directors
by the very persons [[person]] concerned in creating it. "till very lately," say
the presidency, "the nabob placed his dependence on the company. now he
has been taught by ill advisers that an interest out of doors may stand
him in [[good]] stead. he has been made to [[believe]] that _his private
creditors have [[power]] and interest to overrule the court of
directors_."[10] the nabob was not misinformed. the private creditors
instantly qualified a vast number of votes; and having made themselves
masters of the court of proprietors, as well as extending a powerful
cabal in other places as important, they so completely overturned the
authority of the court of directors at [[home]] and abroad, that this [[poor]],
baffled [[government]] was soon obliged to lower its tone. it was glad to be
admitted into partnership with its own servants. the court of
directors, establishing the debt which they had reprobated as a breach
of trust, and which was planned for the subversion of their [[authority]],
settled its payments on a par with those of the [[public]]; and even so were
not able to obtain [[peace]], or even equality in their demands. all the
consequences lay in a regular and irresistible train. by employing their
influence for the recovery of this debt, their orders, issued in the
same breath, against creating new debts, only animated the strong
desires of their servants to this prohibited prolific [[sport]], and it soon
produced a swarm of sons [[son]] and daughters [[daughter]], not in the least degenerated
from the [[virtue]] of their parents.

from that moment the [[authority]] of the court of directors expired in the
carnatic, and everywhere else. "every [[man]]," says the presidency, "who
opposes the [[government]] and its measures, finds an immediate countenance
from the nabob; even our discarded officers, however unworthy, are
received into the nabob's service."[11] it was, indeed, a matter of no
wonderful sagacity to determine whether the court of directors, with
their miserable salaries to their servants, of four or five hundred
pounds a year, or the distributor of millions, was most likely to be
obeyed. it was an invention beyond the [[imagination]] of all the
speculatists of our speculating [[age]], to see a [[government]] quietly settled
in one and the same town, composed of two distinct members: one to pay
scantily for [[obedience]], and the other to bribe high for rebellion and
revolt.

the next thing which recommends this particular debt to the right
honorable gentleman is, it seems, the moderate interest of ten per cent.
it would be lost labor to observe on this assertion. the nabob, in a
long apologetic letter[12] for the transaction between him and the body
of the creditors, states the [[fact]] as i shall [[state]] it to you. in the
accumulation of this debt, the first interest paid was from thirty to
thirty-six per cent; it was then brought down to twenty-five per cent;
at length it was reduced to twenty; and there it found its rest. during
the whole process, as often as any of these monstrous interests fell
into an arrear, (into which they were continually falling,) the arrear,
formed into a new [[capital]],[13] was added to the old, and the same
interest of twenty per cent accrued upon both. the company, having got
some scent of the enormous usury which prevailed at madras, [[thought]] it
necessary to interfere, and to order all interests to be lowered to ten
per cent. this order, which contained no exception, though it by no
means pointed particularly to this class of debts, came like a
thunderclap on the nabob. he considered his [[political]] credit as ruined;
but to find a remedy to this unexpected [[evil]], he again added to the old
principal twenty per cent interest accruing for the [[last]] year. thus a
new fund was formed; and it was on that accumulation of various
principals, and interests heaped upon interests, not on the sum
originally lent, as the [[right]] honorable gentleman would make you
believe, that ten per cent was settled on the whole.

when you consider the enormity of the interest at which these debts were
contracted, and the several interests added to the principal, i believe
you will not [[think]] me so skeptical, if i should [[doubt]] whether for this
debt of 880,000_l._ the nabob ever saw 100,000_l._ in real [[money]]. the
right honorable gentleman suspecting, with all his absolute dominion
over [[fact]], that he never will be able to defend even this venerable
patriarchal [[job]], though sanctified by its numerous issue, and hoary with
prescriptive years, has recourse to recrimination, the [[last]] resource of
guilt. he says that this loan of 1767 was provided for in mr. fox's
india bill; and judging of others by his own [[nature]] and principles [[principle]], he
more than insinuates that this provision was made, not from any sense of
merit in the claim, but from partiality to general smith, a proprietor,
and an agent for that debt. if partiality could have had any weight
against [[justice]] and policy with the then ministers and their [[friends]],
general smith had titles to it. but the [[right]] honorable gentleman knows
as well as i do, that general smith was very far from looking on himself
as partially treated in the arrangements of that [[time]]; indeed, what man
dared to [[hope]] for private partiality in that [[sacred]] plan for relief to
nations?

it is not necessary that the [[right]] honorable gentleman should
sarcastically call that [[time]] to our recollection. well do i remember
every circumstance of that memorable period. [[god]] forbid i should forget
it! o illustrious disgrace! o victorious defeat! may your memorial be
fresh and new to the latest generations! may the day of that generous
conflict be stamped in characters [[character]] never to be cancelled or worn out from
the records of time! let no [[man]] hear of us, who shall not hear, that, in
a struggle against the intrigues of courts and the perfidious levity of
the multitude, we fell in the cause of [[honor]], in the cause of our
country, in the cause of [[human]] [[nature]] itself! but if [[fortune]] should be
as powerful over fame as she has been prevalent over [[virtue]], at least
our [[conscience]] is beyond her jurisdiction. my [[poor]] share in the support
of that [[great]] measure no [[man]] shall ravish from me. it shall be safely
lodged in the sanctuary of my [[heart]],--never, never to be torn from
thence, but with those holds that grapple it to [[life]].

i say, i well [[remember]] that bill, and every one of its honest and its
wise provisions. it is not true that this debt was ever protected or
enforced, or any [[revenue]] whatsoever set apart for it. it was left in
that bill just where it stood: to be paid or not to be paid out of the
nabob's private treasures, according to his own discretion. the company
had actually given it their sanction, though always relying for its
validity on the sole security of the [[faith]] of him[14] who without their
knowledge or [[consent]] entered into the original obligation. it had no
other sanction; it ought to have had no other. so far was mr. fox's bill
from providing _funds_ for it, as this ministry have wickedly done for
this, and for ten times [[time]] worse transactions, out of the [[public]] estate,
that an express clause immediately preceded, positively forbidding any
british [[subject]] from receiving assignments upon any part of the
territorial [[revenue]], on any pretence whatsoever.[15]

you recollect, mr. speaker, that the chancellor of the exchequer
strongly professed to retain every part of mr. fox's bill which was
intended to prevent [[abuse]]; but in _his_ [[india]] bill, which (let me do
justice) is as able and skilful a performance, for its own purposes [[purpose]], as
ever issued from the wit of [[man]], premeditating this [[iniquity]],--

    hoc ipsum ut strueret, trojamque aperiret achivis,--

expunged this essential clause, broke down the fence which was raised to
cover the [[public]] [[property]] against the rapacity of his partisans, and
thus levelling every obstruction, he made a firm, broad highway for sin
and [[death]], for usury and oppression, to renew their ravages throughout
the devoted revenues [[revenue]] of the carnatic.

the tenor, the policy, and the consequences of this debt of 1767 are in
the [[eyes]] of ministry so excellent, that its merits [[merit]] are irresistible; and
it takes the lead to give credit and countenance to all the rest. along
with this chosen [[body]] of heavy-armed infantry, and to support it in the
line, the [[right]] honorable gentleman has stationed his corps of black
cavalry. if there be any advantage between this debt and that of 1769,
according to him the cavalry debt has it. it is not a [[subject]] of
defence: it is a theme of panegyric. listen to the [[right]] honorable
gentleman, and you will find it was contracted to save the [[country]],--to
prevent mutiny in armies [[army]],--to introduce economy in revenues [[revenue]]; and for
all these honorable purposes [[purpose]], it originated at the express [[desire]] and by
the representative [[authority]] of the company itself.

first let me say a word to the [[authority]]. this debt was contracted, not
by the [[authority]] of the company, not by its representatives, (as the
right honorable gentleman has the unparalleled confidence to assert,)
but in the ever-memorable period of 1777, by the usurped [[power]] of those
who rebelliously, in conjunction with the nabob of arcot, had overturned
the lawful [[government]] of madras. for that rebellion this house
unanimously directed a [[public]] prosecution. the delinquents, after they
had subverted [[government]], in order to make to themselves a party to
support them in their [[power]], are universally known to have dealt jobs
about to the [[right]] and to the left, and to any who were willing to
receive them. this usurpation, which the [[right]] honorable gentleman well
knows was brought about by and for the [[great]] mass of these pretended
debts, is the [[authority]] which is set up by him to represent the
company,--to represent that company which, from the first moment of
their hearing of this [[corrupt]] and fraudulent transaction to this hour,
have uniformly disowned and disavowed it.

so much for the [[authority]]. as to the facts [[fact]], partly true, and partly
colorable, as they stand recorded, they are in substance these. the
nabob of arcot, as soon as he had thrown off the superiority of this
country by means of these creditors, kept up a [[great]] [[army]] which he never
paid. of course his soldiers were generally in a [[state]] of mutiny.[16]
the usurping council say that they labored hard with their master, the
nabob, to persuade him to reduce these mutinous and useless [[troops]]. he
consented; but, as usual, pleaded inability to [[pay]] them their arrears.
here was a difficulty. the nabob had no [[money]]; the company had no [[money]];
every [[public]] supply was empty. but there was one resource which no
season has ever yet dried up in that [[climate]]. the _soucars_ were at
hand: that is, private english money-jobbers offered their assistance.
messieurs taylor, majendie, and call proposed to advance the small sum
of 160,000_l._ to [[pay]] off the nabob's black cavalry, provided the
company's [[authority]] was given for their loan. this was the [[great]] point
of policy always aimed at, and pursued through a hundred devices by the
servants at madras. the presidency, who themselves had no [[authority]] for
the functions they presumed to exercise, very readily gave the sanction
of the company to those servants who knew that the company, whose
sanction was demanded, had positively prohibited all such transactions.

however, so far as the reality of the dealing goes, all is hitherto fair
and plausible; and here the [[right]] honorable gentleman concludes, with
commendable prudence, his account of the [[business]]. but here it is i
shall beg leave to commence my supplement: for the gentleman's discreet
modesty has [[led]] him to cut the thread of the story somewhat abruptly.
one of the most essential parties is quite forgotten. why should the
episode of the [[poor]] nabob be omitted? when that [[prince]] chooses it,
nobody can tell his story [[better]]. excuse me, if i apply again to my
book, and give it you from the first hand: from the nabob himself.

"mr. stratton became acquainted with this, and got mr. taylor and
others to lend me four lacs of pagodas towards discharging the arrears
of [[pay]] of my [[troops]]. upon this, i wrote a letter of thanks to mr.
stratton; and upon the [[faith]] of this [[money]] being paid immediately, i
ordered many of my [[troops]] to be discharged by a [[certain]] day, and
lessened the number of my servants. mr. taylor, &c., some [[time]] after
acquainted me, that they had no ready [[money]], but they would grant teeps
payable in four months. this astonished me; for i did not [[know]] what
might happen, when the sepoys were dismissed from my service. i begged
of mr. taylor and the others to [[pay]] this sum to the officers of my
regiments at the [[time]] they mentioned; and [[desired]] the officers, at the
same [[time]], to pacify and persuade the [[men]] belonging to them that their
pay would be given to them _at the end of four months_, and that, till
those arrears were discharged, their [[pay]] should be continued to them.
_two years_ are nearly expired since that [[time]], but mr. taylor has not
yet entirely discharged the arrears of those [[troops]], and i am obliged to
continue their [[pay]] from that [[time]] till this. i hoped to have been able,
by this expedient, to have lessened the number of my [[troops]], and
discharged the arrears due to them, considering the trifle of interest
to mr. taylor and the others as no [[great]] matter; but instead of this, _i
am [[oppressed]] with the burden of [[pay]] due to those [[troops]], and the
interest, which is going on to mr. taylor from the day the teeps were
granted to him_." what i have [[read]] to you is an extract of a letter from
the nabob of the carnatic to governor rumbold, dated the 22d, and
received the 24th of march, 1779.[17]

suppose his highness not to be well broken in to things of this [[kind]],
it must, indeed, surprise so known and established a bond-vender as the
nabob of arcot, one who keeps himself the largest bond-warehouse in the
world, to find that he was now to receive in [[kind]]: not to take [[money]] for
his obligations, but to give his bond in exchange for the bond of
messieurs taylor, majendie, and call, and to [[pay]], besides, a [[good]], smart
interest, legally twelve per cent, (in reality, perhaps, twenty or
twenty-four per cent,) for this exchange of paper. but his [[troops]] were
not to be so paid, or so disbanded. they wanted bread, and could not
live by cutting and shuffling of bonds. the nabob still kept the troops
in service, and was obliged to continue, as you have seen, the whole
expense to exonerate himself from which he became indebted to the
soucars.

had it stood here, the transaction would have been of the most audacious
strain of fraud and usury perhaps ever before discovered, whatever might
have been practised and concealed. but the same [[authority]] (i mean the
nabob's) brings before you something, if possible, more striking. he
states, that, for this their paper, he immediately handed over to these
gentlemen something very different from paper,--that is, the receipt of
a territorial [[revenue]], of which, it seems, they continued as long in
possession as the nabob himself continued in possession of anything.
their payments, therefore, not being to commence before the end of four
months, and not being completed in two years, it must be presumed
(unless they prove the contrary) that their payments to the nabob were
made out of the revenues [[revenue]] they had received from his assignment. thus
they condescended to accumulate a debt of 160,000_l._ with an interest
of twelve per cent, in compensation for a lingering payment to the
nabob of 160,000_l._ of his own [[money]].

still we have not the whole. about two years after the assignment of
those territorial revenues [[revenue]] to these gentlemen, the nabob receives a
remonstrance from his [[chief]] manager in a principal province, of which
this is the tenor. "the _entire_ [[revenue]] of those districts is by your
highness's order set apart to discharge the tunkaws [assignments]
granted to the europeans [[european]]. the gomastahs [agents] of mr. taylor to mr. de
fries are there in order to collect those tunkaws; and as they receive
_all_ the [[revenue]] that is collected, your highness's [[troops]] have _seven
or eight months' [[pay]] due_, which they cannot receive, and are thereby
reduced to the [[greatest]] _distress_. _in such times_ it is highly
necessary to provide for the sustenance of the [[troops]], that they may be
ready to exert themselves in the service of your highness."

here, sir, you see how these causes and effects act upon one another.
one [[body]] of [[troops]] mutinies for want of [[pay]]; a debt is contracted to pay
them; and they still remain unpaid. a territory destined to [[pay]] other
troops is assigned for this debt; and these other [[troops]] fall into the
same [[state]] of indigence and mutiny with the first. bond is paid by bond;
arrear is turned into new arrear; usury engenders new usury; mutiny,
suspended in one quarter, starts up in another; until all the revenues
and all the establishments are entangled into one inextricable knot of
confusion, from which they are only disengaged by being entirely
destroyed. in that [[state]] of confusion, in a very few months after the
date of the memorial i have just [[read]] to you, things were found, when
the nabob's [[troops]], famished to feed english soucars, instead of
defending the [[country]], joined the invaders, and deserted in entire
bodies to hyder ali.[18]

the manner in which this transaction was carried on shows that good
examples are not easily forgot, especially by those who are bred in a
great school. one of those splendid examples [[example]] give me leave to mention,
at a somewhat more early period; because one fraud furnishes [[light]] to
the discovery of another, and so on, until the whole secret of
mysterious [[iniquity]] bursts upon you in a blaze of detection. the paper i
shall [[read]] you is not on record. if you please, you may take it on my
word. it is a letter written from one of undoubted information in madras
to sir john clavering, describing the practice that prevailed there,
whilst the company's allies were under sale, during the [[time]] of governor
winch's administration.

"one mode," says clavering's correspondent, "of amassing [[money]] at the
nabob's cost is [[curious]]. he is generally in arrears to the company. here
the governor, being cash-keeper, is generally on [[good]] terms with the
banker, who manages matters thus. the governor presses the nabob for the
balance due from him; the nabob flies to his banker for relief; the
banker engages to [[pay]] the [[money]], and grants his notes accordingly, which
he puts in the cash-book as ready [[money]]; the nabob pays [[pay]] him an interest
for it at two and three per cent _per mensem_, till the tunkaws he
grants on the particular districts for it are paid. matters in the mean
time are so managed that there is no call for this [[money]] for the
company's service till the tunkaws become due. by this means not a cash
is advanced by the banker, though he receives a heavy interest from the
nabob, which is divided as lawful spoil."

here, mr. speaker, you have the whole art [[arts]] and mystery, the true
free-mason secret, of the profession of _soucaring_; by which a few
innocent, inexperienced [[young]] englishmen, such as mr. paul benfield, for
instance, without [[property]] upon which any one would lend to themselves a
single shilling, are enabled at once to take provinces in mortgage, to
make princes [[prince]] their debtors, and to become creditors for millions.

but it seems the [[right]] honorable gentleman's favorite soucar cavalry
have proved the payment before the mayor's court at madras! have they
so? why, then, defraud our [[anxiety]] and their characters [[character]] of that proof?
is it not enough that the charges which i have laid before you have
stood on record against these [[poor]] injured gentlemen for eight years? is
it not enough that they are in print by the orders of the east india
company for five years? after these gentlemen have borne all the odium
of this publication and all the indignation of the directors with such
unexampled equanimity, now that they are at length stimulated into
feeling are you to deny them their just relief? but will the right
honorable gentleman be pleased to tell us how they came not to give this
satisfaction to the court of directors, their lawful masters, during all
the eight years of this litigated claim? were they not bound, by every
tie that can bind [[man]], to give them this satisfaction? this day, for the
first [[time]], we hear of the proofs. but when were these proofs offered?
in what cause? who were the parties? who inspected, who contested this
belated account? let us see something to oppose to the [[body]] of record
which appears against them. the mayor's court! the mayor's court!
pleasant! does not the honorable gentleman [[know]] that the first corps of
creditors (the creditors of 1767) stated it as a sort of hardship to
them, that they could not have [[justice]] at madras, from the impossibility
of their supporting their claims in the mayor's court? why? because, say
they, the members of that court were themselves creditors, and therefore
could not sit as judges [[judge]].[19] are we ripe to say that no creditor under
similar circumstances was member of the court, when the payment which is
the ground of this cavalry debt was put in proof?[20] nay, are we not in
a manner compelled to conclude that the court was so constituted, when
we [[know]] there is scarcely a [[man]] in madras who has not some participation
in these transactions? it is a shame to hear such proofs mentioned,
instead of the honest, vigorous scrutiny which the circumstances of such
an affair so indispensably call for.

but his majesty's ministers, indulgent enough to other scrutinies, have
not been satisfied with authorizing the payment of this demand without
such inquiry as the act has prescribed; but they have added the arrear
of twelve per cent interest, from the year 1777 to the year 1784, to
make a new [[capital]], raising thereby 160 to 294,000_l._ then they charge
a new twelve per cent on the whole from that period, for a transaction
in which it will be a miracle if a [[single]] penny will be ever found
really advanced from the private stock of the pretended creditors.

in this manner, and at such an interest, the ministers have thought
proper to dispose of 294,000_l._ of the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]], for what is
called the cavalry loan. after dispatching this, the [[right]] honorable
gentleman leads to [[battle]] his [[last]] grand division, the consolidated debt
of 1777. but having exhausted all his panegyric on the two first, he has
nothing at all to say in favor of the [[last]]. on the contrary, he admits
that it was contracted in defiance of the company's orders, without even
the pretended sanction of any pretended representatives. nobody, indeed,
has yet been found hardy enough to stand forth avowedly in its defence.
but it is little to the credit of the [[age]], that what has not
plausibility enough to find an advocate has influence enough to obtain a
protector. could any [[man]] expect to find that protector anywhere? but
what must every [[man]] [[think]], when he finds that protector in the chairman
of the committee of secrecy[21], who had published to the house, and to
the [[world]], the facts [[fact]] that condemn these debts, the orders that forbid
the incurring of them, the dreadful consequences which attended them?
even in his official letter, when he tramples on his parliamentary
report, yet his general [[language]] is the same. [[read]] the preface to this
part of the ministerial arrangement, and you would imagine that this
debt was to be crushed, with all the weight of indignation which could
fall from a vigilant guardian of the [[public]] treasury upon those who
attempted to rob it. what must be [[felt]] by every [[man]] who has feeling,
when, after such a thundering preamble of condemnation, this debt is
ordered to be paid without any sort of inquiry into its
authenticity,--without a [[single]] step taken to settle even the amount of
the demand,--without an attempt so much as to ascertain the real persons
claiming a sum which rises in the accounts from one million three
hundred thousand pound sterling to two million four hundred thousand
pound, principal [[money]],[22]--without an attempt made to ascertain the
proprietors, of whom no list has ever yet been laid before the court of
directors,--of proprietors who are known to be in a collusive shuffle,
by which they never appear to be the same in any two lists handed about
for their own particular purposes [[purpose]]?

my honorable friend who made you the motion has sufficiently exposed the
nature of this debt. he has stated to you, that _its own agents_, in the
year 1781, in the arrangement _they proposed_ to make at calcutta, were
satisfied to have twenty-five per cent at once struck off from the
capital of a [[great]] part of this debt, and prayed to have a provision
made for this reduced principal, without any interest at all. this was
an arrangement of _their own_, an arrangement made by those who best
knew the true [[constitution]] of their own debt, who knew how little favor
it merited,[23] and how little hopes [[hope]] they had to find any persons [[person]] in
authority abandoned enough to support it as it stood.

but what [[corrupt]] [[men]], in the fond imaginations [[imagination]] of a sanguine avarice,
had not the confidence to propose, they have found a chancellor of the
exchequer in [[england]] hardy enough to undertake for them. he has cheered
their drooping spirits. he has thanked the peculators for not despairing
of their commonwealth. he has told them they were too modest. he has
replaced the twenty-five per cent which, in order to lighten themselves,
they had abandoned in their conscious terror. instead of cutting off the
interest, as they had themselves consented to do, with the fourth of the
capital, he has added the whole [[growth]] of four years' usury of twelve
per cent to the first overgrown principal; and has again grafted on this
meliorated stock a perpetual annuity of six per cent, to take place from
the year 1781. let no [[man]] hereafter talk of the decaying energies of
nature. all the acts and monuments in the records of peculation, the
consolidated [[corruption]] of ages [[age]], the patterns of exemplary plunder in
the heroic times [[time]] of roman [[iniquity]], never equalled the gigantic
corruption of this [[single]] act. never did nero, in all the insolent
prodigality of despotism, deal out to his prætorian guards a donation
fit to be named with the largess showered down by the bounty of our
chancellor of the exchequer on the faithful band of his [[indian]] sepoys.

the [[right]] honorable gentleman[24] lets you freely and voluntarily into
the whole transaction. so perfectly has his conduct confounded his
understanding, that he fairly tells you that through the course of the
whole [[business]] he has never conferred with any but the agents of the
pretended creditors. after this, do you want more to establish a secret
understanding with the parties,--to fix, beyond a [[doubt]], their collusion
and participation in a [[common]] fraud?

if this were not enough, he has furnished you with other presumptions
that are not to be shaken. it is one of the known indications of guilt
to stagger and prevaricate in a story, and to vary in the motives that
are assigned to conduct. try these ministers by this [[rule]]. in their
official dispatch, they tell the presidency of madras that they have
established the debt for two reasons [[reason]]: first, because the nabob (the
party indebted) does not dispute it; secondly, because it is mischievous
to keep it longer afloat, and that the payment of the [[european]] creditors
will promote circulation in the [[country]]. these two motives (for the
plainest reasons [[reason]] in the world) the [[right]] honorable gentleman has this
day [[thought]] fit totally to abandon. in the first place, he rejects the
authority of the nabob of arcot. it would, indeed, be pleasant to see
him adhere to this exploded testimony. he next, upon grounds equally
solid, abandons the benefits of that circulation which was to be
produced by drawing out all the juices of the [[body]]. laying aside, or
forgetting, these pretences of his dispatch, he has just now assumed a
principle totally different, but to the full as extraordinary. he
proceeds upon a supposition that many of the claims may be fictitious.
he then finds, that, in a case where many valid and many fraudulent
claims are blended together, the [[best]] course for their discrimination is
indiscriminately to establish them all. he trusts, (i suppose,) as there
may not be a fund sufficient for every description of creditors, that
the [[best]] warranted claimants will exert themselves in bringing to light
those debts which will not bear an inquiry. what he will not do himself
he is persuaded will be done by others; and for this [[purpose]] he leaves
to any [[person]] a general [[power]] of excepting to the debt. this total
change of [[language]] and prevarication in [[principle]] is enough, if it stood
alone, to fix the presumption of unfair dealing. his dispatch assigns
motives of policy, concord, [[trade]], and circulation: his [[speech]] proclaims
discord and litigations, and proposes, as the ultimate end, detection.

but he may shift his reasons [[reason]], and wind and turn as he will, confusion
waits him at all his doubles. who will undertake this detection? will
the nabob? but the [[right]] honorable gentleman has himself this moment
told us that no [[prince]] of the [[country]] can by any motive be prevailed
upon to discover any fraud that is practised upon him by the company's
servants. he says what (with the exception of the complaint against the
cavalry loan) all the [[world]] knows [[know]] to be true: and without that prince's
concurrence, what evidence can be had of the fraud of any the smallest
of these demands? the ministers never authorized any [[person]] to enter
into his exchequer and to search his records. why, then, this shameful
and insulting mockery of a pretended contest? already contests for a
preference have arisen among these rival bond-creditors. has not the
company itself struggled for a preference for years, without any attempt
at detection of the [[nature]] of those debts with which they contended?
well is the nabob of arcot attended to in the only specific complaint he
has ever made. he complained of unfair dealing in the cavalry loan. it
is fixed upon him with interest on interest; and this loan is excepted
from all [[power]] of litigation.

this day, and not before, the [[right]] honorable gentleman thinks [[think]] that the
general establishment of all claims is the surest way of laying open the
fraud of some of them. in [[india]] this is a reach of deep policy. but what
would be [[thought]] of this mode of acting on a demand upon the treasury in
england? instead of all this cunning, is there not one plain way
open,--that is, to put the burden of the proof on those who make the
demand? ought not ministry to have said to the creditors, "the person
who admits your debt stands excepted to as evidence; he stands charged
as a collusive party, to hand over the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]] to you for
sinister purposes [[purpose]]. you say, you have a demand of some millions on the
indian treasury; prove that you have acted by lawful [[authority]]; prove,
at least, that your [[money]] has been _bonâ fide_ advanced; entitle
yourself to my protection by the fairness and fulness of the
communications you make"? did an honest creditor ever refuse that
reasonable and honest test?

there is little [[doubt]] that several individuals [[individual]] have been seduced by the
purveyors to the nabob of arcot to put their [[money]] (perhaps the whole of
honest and laborious earnings) into their hands, and that at such high
interest as, being condemned at [[law]], leaves them at the [[mercy]] of the
great managers whom they trusted. these seduced creditors are probably
persons of no [[power]] or interest either in [[england]] or [[india]], and may be
just objects of compassion. by taking, in this arrangement, no measures
for discrimination and discovery, the fraudulent and the [[fair]] are in the
first instance confounded in one mass. the subsequent selection and
distribution is left to the nabob. with him the agents and instruments
of his [[corruption]], whom he sees to be omnipotent in [[england]], and who may
serve him in future, as they have done in times [[time]] [[past]], will have
precedence, if not an exclusive preference. these leading interests
domineer, and have always domineered, over the whole. by this
arrangement, the persons [[person]] seduced are made dependent on their seducers;
honesty (comparative honesty at least) must become of the party of
fraud, and must quit its proper [[character]] and its just claims, to
entitle itself to the alms of bribery and peculation.

but be these english creditors what they may, the creditors most
certainly not fraudulent are the natives, who are numerous and wretched
indeed: by exhausting the whole revenues [[revenue]] of the carnatic, nothing is
left for them. they lent _bonâ fide_; in all probability they were even
forced to lend, or to give goods [[good]] and service for the nabob's
obligations. they had no trusts to carry to his market. they had no
faith of alliances to sell. they had no nations to betray to robbery and
ruin. they had no lawful [[government]] seditiously to overturn; nor had
they a governor, to whom it is owing that you [[exist]] in [[india]], to deliver
over to captivity, and to [[death]] in a shameful prison.[25]

these were the merits [[merit]] of the principal part of the debt of 1777, and the
universally conceived causes of its [[growth]]; and thus the unhappy natives
are deprived of every [[hope]] of payment for their real debts, to make
provision for the arrears of unsatisfied bribery and [[treason]]. you see in
this instance that the presumption of guilt is not only no exception to
the demands on the [[public]] treasury, but with these ministers it is a
necessary condition to their support. but that you may not [[think]] this
preference solely owing to their known contempt of the natives, who
ought with every generous [[mind]] to claim their first charities, you will
find the same [[rule]] religiously observed with europeans [[european]] too. attend, sir,
to this decisive case. since the beginning of the [[war]], besides arrears
of every [[kind]], a bond-debt has been contracted at madras, uncertain in
its amount, but represented from four hundred thousand pound to a
million sterling. it stands only at the low interest of eight per cent.
of the legal [[authority]] on which this debt was contracted, of its
purposes for the very being of the [[state]], of its publicity and fairness,
no [[doubt]] has been entertained for a moment. for this debt no sort of
provision whatever has been made. it is rejected as an outcast, whilst
the whole undissipated attention of the minister has been employed for
the discharge of claims entitled to his favor by the merits [[merit]] we have
seen.

i have endeavored to find out, if possible, the amount of the whole of
those demands, in order to see how much, supposing the [[country]] in a
condition to furnish the fund, may remain to satisfy the [[public]] debt and
the necessary establishments. but i have been foiled in my attempt.

about one fourth, that is, about 220,000_l._, of the loan of 1767
remains unpaid. how much interest is in arrear i could never discover:
seven or eight years' at least, which would make the whole of that debt
about 396,000_l._ this stock, which the ministers in their instructions
to the governor of madras [[state]] as the least exceptionable, they have
thought proper to distinguish by a marked severity, leaving it the only
one on which the interest is not added to the principal to beget a new
interest.

the cavalry loan, by the operation of the same [[authority]], is made up to
294,000_l._; and this 294,000_l._, made up of principal and interest, is
crowned with a new interest of twelve per cent.

what the grand loan, the bribery loan of 1777, may be is amongst the
deepest mysteries of [[state]]. it is probably the first debt ever assuming
the title of consolidation that did not express what the amount of the
sum consolidated was. it is little less than a contradiction in terms.
in the debt of the year 1767 the sum was stated in the act of
consolidation, and made to amount to 880,000_l._ [[capital]]. when this
consolidation of 1777 was first announced at the durbar, it was
represented authentically at 2,400,000_l._ in that, or rather in a
higher [[state]], sir thomas rumbold found and condemned it.[26] it
afterwards fell into such a terror as to sweat away a million of its
weight at once; and it sunk to 1,400,000_l._[27] however, it never was
without a resource for recruiting it to its old plumpness. there was a
sort of floating debt of about four or five hundred thousand pounds more
ready to be added, as [[occasion]] should require.

in short, when you pressed this sensitive-plant, it always contracted
its dimensions. when the rude hand of inquiry was withdrawn, it expanded
in all the luxuriant vigor of its original vegetation. in the treaty of
1781, the whole of the nabob's debt to private europeans [[european]] is by mr.
sulivan, agent to the nabob and his creditors, stated at 2,800,000_l._,
which, if the cavalry loan and the remains of the debt of 1767 be
subtracted, leaves it nearly at the amount originally declared at the
durbar in 1777: but then there is a private instruction to mr. sulivan,
which, it seems, will reduce it again to the lower standard of
1,400,000_l._

failing in all my attempts, by a direct account, to ascertain the extent
of the [[capital]] claimed, (where in all probability no [[capital]] was ever
advanced,) i endeavored, if possible, to discover it by the interest
which was to be paid. for that [[purpose]], i looked to the several
agreements for assigning the territories of the carnatic to secure the
principal and interest of this debt. in one of them,[28] i found, in a
sort of postscript, by way of an additional remark, (not in the [[body]] of
the obligation,) the debt represented at 1,400,000_l._: but when i
computed the sums to be paid for interest by instalments in another
paper, i found they produced an interest of two millions, at twelve per
cent; and the assignment supposed, that, if these instalments might
exceed, they might also fall short of, the real provision for that
interest.[29] another instalment-bond was afterwards granted: in that
bond the interest exactly tallies with a [[capital]] of 1,400,000_l._:[30]
but pursuing this [[capital]] through the correspondence, i lost sight of it
again, and it was asserted that this instalment-bond was considerably
short of the interest that ought to be computed to the time
mentioned.[31]

here are, therefore, two statements of [[equal]] [[authority]], differing at
least a million from each other; and as neither persons [[person]] claiming, nor
any special sum as belonging to each particular claimant, is ascertained
in the instruments of consolidation, or in the installment-bonds, a
large scope was left to throw in any sums for any persons [[person]], as their
merits in advancing the interest of that loan might require; a [[power]] was
also left for reduction, in case a harder hand, or more scanty funds,
might be found to require it. stronger grounds for a presumption of
fraud never appeared in any transaction. but the ministers, faithful to
the plan of the interested persons [[person]], whom alone they [[thought]] fit to
confer with on this [[occasion]], have ordered the payment of the whole mass
of these unknown, unliquidated sums, without an attempt to ascertain
them. on this conduct, sir, i leave you to make your own reflections.

it is impossible (at least i have found it impossible) to fix on the
real amount of the pretended debts with which your ministers have
thought proper to load the carnatic. they are obscure; they shun
inquiry; they are enormous. that is all you [[know]] of them.

that you may [[judge]] what [[chance]] any honorable and useful end of
government has for a provision that comes in for the leavings of these
gluttonous demands, i must take it on myself to bring before you the
real condition of that abused, insulted, racked, and ruined [[country]];
though in [[truth]] my [[mind]] revolts from it, though you will hear it with
horror, and i confess i tremble when i [[think]] on these awful and
confounding dispensations of providence. i shall first trouble you with
a few words as to the cause.

the [[great]] fortunes [[fortune]] made in [[india]], in the beginnings of [[conquest]],
naturally excited an emulation in all the parts and through the whole
succession of the company's service. but in the company it gave rise to
other sentiments. they did not find the new channels of acquisition flow
with [[equal]] riches [[rich]] to them. on the contrary, the high flood-tide of
private emolument was generally in the lowest ebb of their affairs. they
began also to [[fear]] that the [[fortune]] of [[war]] might take away what the
fortune of [[war]] had given. wars [[war]] were accordingly discouraged by repeated
injunctions and menaces: and that the servants might not be bribed into
them by the native princes [[prince]], they were strictly forbidden to take any
money whatsoever from their hands. but vehement passion is ingenious in
resources. the company's servants were not only stimulated, but better
instructed by the prohibition. they soon fell upon a contrivance which
answered their purposes [[purpose]] far [[better]] than the methods which were
forbidden: though in this also they violated an ancient, but they
thought, an abrogated order. they reversed their proceedings. instead of
receiving presents [[present]], they made loans. instead of carrying on wars [[war]] in
their own name, they contrived an [[authority]], at once irresistible and
irresponsible, in whose name they might ravage at [[pleasure]]; and being
thus freed from all restraint, they indulged themselves in the most
extravagant speculations of plunder. the cabal of creditors who have
been the object of the late bountiful grant from his majesty's
ministers, in order to possess themselves, under the name of creditors
and assignees, of every [[country]] in [[india]], as fast as it should be
conquered, inspired into the [[mind]] of the nabob of arcot (then a
dependant on the company of the humblest order) a scheme of the most
wild and desperate [[ambition]] that i [[believe]] ever was admitted into the
thoughts of a [[man]] so situated.[32] first, they persuaded him to
consider himself as a principal member in the [[political]] [[system]] of
europe. in the next place, they held out to him, and he readily imbibed,
the [[idea]] of the general [[empire]] of hindostan. as a preliminary to this
undertaking, they prevailed on him to propose a tripartite division of
that vast [[country]]: one part to the company; another to the mahrattas;
and the third to himself. to himself he reserved all the southern part
of the [[great]] peninsula, comprehended under the general name of the
deccan.

on this scheme of their servants, the company was to appear in the
carnatic in no other [[light]] than as a contractor for the provision of
armies, and the hire of mercenaries for his use and under his direction.
this disposition was to be secured by the nabob's putting himself under
the guaranty of [[france]], and, by the means of that rival nation,
preventing the english forever from assuming an equality, much less a
superiority, in the carnatic. in pursuance of this treasonable project,
(treasonable on the part of the english,) they extinguished the company
as a [[sovereign]] [[power]] in that part of [[india]]; they withdrew the company's
garrisons out of all the forts and strongholds of the carnatic; they
declined to receive the ambassadors from [[foreign]] courts, and remitted
them to the nabob of arcot; they fell upon, and totally destroyed, the
oldest ally of the company, the [[king]] of tanjore, and plundered the
country to the amount of near five millions sterling; one after
another, in the nabob's name, but with english [[force]], they brought into
a miserable servitude all the princes [[prince]] and [[great]] independent nobility of
a vast [[country]].[33] in proportion to these treasons and violences, which
ruined the [[people]], the fund of the nabob's debt grew and flourished.

among the victims to this magnificent plan of universal plunder, worthy
of the heroic avarice of the projectors, you have all heard (and he has
made himself to be well remembered) of an [[indian]] [[chief]] called hyder ali
khan. this [[man]] possessed the western, as the company, under the name of
the nabob of arcot, does the eastern division of the carnatic. it was
among the leading measures in the design of this cabal (according to
their own emphatic language) to _extirpate_ this hyder ali.[34] they
declared the nabob of arcot to be his [[sovereign]], and himself to be a
rebel, and publicly invested their instrument with the sovereignty of
the [[kingdom]] of mysore. but their victim was not of the passive [[kind]].
they were soon obliged to conclude a treaty of [[peace]] and close alliance
with this rebel, at the gates of madras. both before and since that
treaty, every [[principle]] of policy pointed out this [[power]] as a natural
alliance; and on his part it was courted by every sort of amicable
office. but the cabinet council of english creditors would not suffer
their nabob of arcot to sign the treaty, nor even to give to a [[prince]] at
least his [[equal]] the ordinary titles of [[respect]] and courtesy.[35] from
that [[time]] forward, a continued plot was carried on within the divan,
black and [[white]], of the nabob of arcot, for the destruction of hyder
ali. as to the outward members of the double, or rather treble
government of madras, which had signed the treaty, they were always
prevented by some overruling influence (which they do not describe, but
which cannot be misunderstood) from performing what [[justice]] and interest
combined so evidently to enforce.[36]

when at length hyder ali found that he had to do with [[men]] who either
would sign no convention, or whom no treaty and no signature could bind,
and who were the determined enemies [[enemy]] of [[human]] intercourse itself, he
decreed to make the [[country]] possessed by these incorrigible and
predestinated criminals [[criminal]] a memorable [[example]] to [[mankind]]. he resolved, in
the gloomy recesses of a [[mind]] capacious of such things, to leave the
whole carnatic an everlasting monument of vengeance, and to put
perpetual desolation as a barrier between him and those against whom the
faith which holds the [[moral]] elements of the [[world]] together was no
protection. he became at length so confident of his [[force]], so collected
in his might, that he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful
resolution. having terminated his disputes with every [[enemy]] and every
rival, who buried their mutual animosities in their [[common]] detestation
against the creditors of the nabob of arcot, he drew from every quarter
whatever a savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the [[arts]] of
destruction; and compounding all the materials of fury, havoc, and
desolation into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities
of the mountains. whilst the authors of all these evils [[evil]] were idly and
stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor, which blackened all their
horizon, it suddenly burst, and poured down the whole of its contents
upon the plains of the carnatic. then ensued a scene of woe, the like of
which no eye had seen, no [[heart]] conceived, and which no tongue can
adequately tell. all the horrors of [[war]] before known or heard of were
mercy to that new havoc. a storm of universal [[fire]] blasted every field,
consumed every house, destroyed every temple. the miserable inhabitants,
flying from their flaming villages, in part were slaughtered; others,
without regard to [[sex]], to [[age]], to the [[respect]] of rank or sacredness of
function, fathers [[father]] torn from [[children]], husbands from wives [[wife]], enveloped in
a whirlwind of cavalry, and amidst the goading spears of drivers, and
the trampling of pursuing horses, were swept into captivity in an
unknown and hostile [[land]]. those who were able to evade this tempest fled
to the walled cities [[city]]; but escaping from [[fire]], [[sword]], and [[exile]], they
fell into the jaws of famine.

the alms of the settlement, in this dreadful exigency, were certainly
liberal; and all was done by charity that private charity could do: but
it was a [[people]] in beggary; it was a nation which stretched out its
hands for food. for months together, these creatures of sufferance,
whose very excess and luxury in their most plenteous days had fallen
short of the allowance of our austerest fasts, silent, patient,
resigned, without sedition or disturbance, almost without complaint,
perished by an hundred a day in the streets of madras; every day seventy
at least laid their bodies [[body]] in the streets or on the glacis of tanjore,
and expired of famine in the granary of [[india]]. i was going to awake your
justice towards this unhappy part of our fellow-citizens, by bringing
before you some of the circumstances of this plague of [[hunger]]: of all
the calamities which beset and waylay the [[life]] of [[man]], this comes the
nearest to our [[heart]], and is that wherein the proudest of us all feels
himself to be nothing more than he is: but i find myself unable to
manage it with decorum; these details are of a [[species]] of [[horror]] so
nauseous and disgusting, they are so degrading to the sufferers and to
the hearers, they are so humiliating to [[human]] [[nature]] itself, that, on
better thoughts [[thought]], i find it more advisable to throw a pall over this
hideous object, and to leave it to your general conceptions.

for eighteen months,[37] without intermission, this destruction raged
from the gates of madras to the gates of tanjore; and so completely did
these masters in their art [[arts]], hyder ali and his more ferocious [[son]],
absolve themselves of their impious vow, that, when the british armies
traversed, as they did, the carnatic for hundreds of miles in all
directions, through the whole line of their march they did not see one
man, not one woman, not one child, not one four-footed beast of any
description whatever. one [[dead]], uniform [[silence]] reigned over the whole
region. with the inconsiderable exceptions of the narrow vicinage of
some few forts, i [[wish]] to be understood as speaking literally. i mean to
produce to you more than three witnesses, above all exception, who will
support this assertion in its full extent. that hurricane of [[war]] passed
through every part of the central provinces of the carnatic. six or
seven districts to the north and to the south (and these not wholly
untouched) escaped the general ravage.

the carnatic is a [[country]] not much inferior in extent to [[england]]. figure
to yourself, mr. speaker, the [[land]] in whose representative chair you
sit; figure to yourself the form and [[fashion]] of your sweet and cheerful
country from thames to trent, north and south, and from the irish to the
german sea, east and west, emptied and embowelled (may [[god]] avert the
omen of our crimes!) by so accomplished a desolation. extend your
imagination a little further, and then suppose your ministers taking a
survey of this scene of waste and desolation. what would be your
thoughts, if you should be informed that they were computing how much
had been the amount of the excises, how much the customs, how much the
land and malt tax, in order that they should charge (take it in the most
favorable light) for [[public]] service, upon the relics of the satiated
vengeance of relentless enemies [[enemy]], the whole of what [[england]] had yielded
in the most exuberant seasons of [[peace]] and abundance? what would you
call it? to call it [[tyranny]] sublimed into madness would be too faint an
image; yet this very madness is the [[principle]] upon which the ministers
at your [[right]] hand have proceeded in their estimate of the revenues [[revenue]] of
the carnatic, when they were providing, not supply for the
establishments of its protection, but rewards [[reward]] for the authors of its
ruin.

every day you are fatigued and disgusted with this cant, "the carnatic
is a [[country]] that will soon recover, and become instantly as prosperous
as ever." they [[think]] they are talking to innocents, who will [[believe]],
that, by sowing of dragons' teeth, [[men]] may come up ready grown and ready
armed. they who will give themselves the trouble of considering (for it
requires no [[great]] reach of [[thought]], no very profound knowledge) the
manner in which [[mankind]] are increased, and countries [[country]] cultivated, will
regard all this raving as it ought to be regarded. in order that the
people, after a long period of vexation and plunder, may be in a
condition to maintain [[government]], [[government]] must begin by maintaining
them. here the road to economy lies [[lie]] not through receipt, but through
expense; and in that [[country]] [[nature]] has given no short cut to your
object. [[men]] must propagate, like other animals, by the mouth. never did
oppression [[light]] the nuptial torch; never did extortion and usury spread
out the genial bed. does any of you [[think]] that [[england]], so wasted,
would, under such a nursing attendance, so rapidly and cheaply recover?
but he is meanly acquainted with either [[england]] or [[india]] who does not
know that [[england]] would a thousand times [[time]] sooner resume [[population]],
fertility, and what ought to be the ultimate secretion from both,
revenue, than such a [[country]] as the carnatic.

the carnatic is not by the bounty of [[nature]] a fertile soil. the general
size of its cattle is proof enough that it is much otherwise. it is some
days since i moved that a [[curious]] and interesting map, kept in the
india house, should be laid before you.[38] the [[india]] house is not yet
in readiness to send it; i have therefore brought down my own copy, and
there it lies [[lie]] for the use of any gentleman who may [[think]] such a matter
worthy of his attention. it is, indeed, a [[noble]] map, and of noble
things; but it is decisive against the golden dreams [[dream]] and sanguine
speculations of avarice run mad. in addition to what you [[know]] must be
the case in every part of the [[world]], (the necessity of a previous
provision of habitation, seed, stock, [[capital]],) that map will show you
that the uses of the influences of [[heaven]] itself are in that [[country]] a
work of art [[arts]]. the carnatic is refreshed by few or no living brooks or
running streams, and it has rain only at a season; but its product of
rice exacts the use of water [[subject]] to perpetual command. this is the
national bank of the carnatic, on which it must have a perpetual credit,
or it perishes irretrievably. for that [[reason]], in the happier times [[time]] of
india, a number, almost incredible, of reservoirs have been made in
chosen places throughout the whole [[country]]: they are formed, for the
greater part, of mounds of [[earth]] and stones, with sluices of solid
masonry; the whole constructed with admirable [[skill]] and labor, and
maintained at a mighty charge. in the territory contained in that map
alone, i have been at the trouble of reckoning the reservoirs, and they
amount to upwards of eleven hundred, from the extent of two or three
acres to five miles in circuit. from these reservoirs currents are
occasionally drawn over the fields, and these watercourses again call
for a considerable expense to keep them properly scoured and duly
levelled. taking the district in that map as a measure, there cannot be
in the carnatic and tanjore fewer than ten thousand of these reservoirs
of the larger and middling dimensions, to say nothing of those for
domestic services, and the use of [[religious]] purification. these are not
the enterprises of your [[power]], nor in a style of magnificence suited to
the taste of your minister. these are the monuments of real kings [[king]], who
were the fathers [[father]] of their [[people]],--testators to a [[posterity]] which they
embraced as their own. these are the grand sepulchres built by
ambition,--but by the [[ambition]] of an insatiable benevolence, which, not
contented with reigning in the dispensation of [[happiness]] during the
contracted term of [[human]] [[life]], had strained, with all the reachings and
graspings of a vivacious [[mind]], to extend the dominion of their bounty
beyond the limits of [[nature]], and to perpetuate themselves through
generations of generations [[generation]], the guardians, the protectors, the
nourishers of [[mankind]].

long before the late [[invasion]], the persons [[person]] who are objects of the grant
of [[public]] [[money]] now before you had so diverted the supply of the pious
funds of [[culture]] and [[population]], that everywhere the reservoirs were
fallen into a miserable decay.[39] but after those domestic enemies [[enemy]] had
provoked the entry of a cruel [[foreign]] foe into the [[country]], he did not
leave it, until his [[revenge]] had completed the destruction begun by their
avarice. few, very few indeed, of these magazines of water that are not
either totally destroyed, or cut through with such gaps as to require a
serious attention and much cost to reëstablish them, as the means of
present subsistence to the [[people]] and of future [[revenue]] to the [[state]].

what, sir, would a [[virtuous]] and enlightened ministry do, on the view of
the ruins of such works [[work]] before them?--on the view of such a chasm of
desolation as that which yawned in the midst of those countries [[country]], to the
north and south, which still bore some vestiges of cultivation? they
would have reduced all their most necessary establishments; they would
have suspended the justest payments; they would have employed every
shilling derived from the producing to reanimate the powers [[power]] of the
unproductive parts. while they were performing this fundamental [[duty]],
whilst they were celebrating these mysteries of [[justice]] and [[humanity]],
they would have told the corps of fictitious creditors, whose crimes
were their claims, that they must keep an awful distance,--that they
must [[silence]] their inauspicious tongues,--that they must hold off their
profane, unhallowed paws from this holy [[work]]; they would have
proclaimed, with a voice that should make itself heard, that on every
country the first creditor is the plough,--that this original,
indefeasible claim supersedes every other demand.

this is what a [[wise]] and [[virtuous]] ministry would have done and said.
this, therefore, is what our minister could never [[think]] of saying or
doing. a ministry of another [[kind]] would have first improved the [[country]],
and have thus laid a solid foundation for future opulence and future
force. but on this grand point of the restoration of the [[country]] there
is not one syllable to be found in the correspondence of our ministers,
from the first to the [[last]]; they [[felt]] nothing for a [[land]] desolated by
fire, [[sword]], and famine: their sympathies took another direction; they
were touched with [[pity]] for bribery, so long tormented with a fruitless
itching of its palms; their bowels yearned for usury, that had long
missed the harvest of its returning months;[40] they [[felt]] for
peculation, which had been for so many years raking in the dust of an
empty treasury; they were melted into compassion for rapine and
oppression, licking their dry, parched, unbloody jaws. these were the
objects of their solicitude. these were the necessities for which they
were studious to provide.

to [[state]] the [[country]] and its revenues [[revenue]] in their real condition, and to
provide for those fictitious claims, consistently with the support of an
army and a civil establishment, would have been impossible; therefore
the ministers are silent on that head, and rest themselves on the
authority of [[lord]] macartney, who, in a letter to the court of directors,
written in the year 1781, speculating on what might be the result of a
wise management of the countries [[country]] assigned by the nabob of arcot, rates
the [[revenue]], as in [[time]] of [[peace]], at twelve hundred thousand pounds a
year, as he does those of the [[king]] of tanjore (which had not been
assigned) at four hundred and fifty. on this [[lord]] macartney grounds his
calculations, and on this they choose to ground theirs. it was on this
calculation that the ministry, in direct opposition to the remonstrances
of the court of directors, have compelled that miserable enslaved body
to put their hands to an order for appropriating the enormous sum of
480,000_l._ annually, as a fund for paying to their rebellious servants
a debt contracted in defiance of their clearest and most positive
injunctions.

the [[authority]] and information of [[lord]] macartney is held high on this
occasion, though it is totally rejected in every other particular of
this [[business]]. i [[believe]] i have the [[honor]] of being almost as old an
acquaintance as any [[lord]] macartney has. a constant and unbroken
friendship has subsisted between us from a very early period; and i
trust he thinks [[think]], that, as i [[respect]] his [[character]], and in general admire
his conduct, i am one of those who [[feel]] no [[common]] interest in his
reputation. yet i do not hesitate wholly to disallow the calculation of
1781, without any apprehension that i shall appear to distrust his
veracity or his [[judgment]]. this [[peace]] estimate of [[revenue]] was not
grounded on the [[state]] of the carnatic, as it then, or as it had
recently, stood. it was a statement of former and [[better]] times [[time]]. there is
no [[doubt]] that a period did [[exist]], when the large portion of the carnatic
held by the nabob of arcot might be fairly reputed to [[produce]] a revenue
to that, or to a greater amount. but the whole had so melted away by the
slow and silent hostility of oppression and mismanagement, that the
revenues, sinking with the [[prosperity]] of the [[country]], had fallen to
about 800,000_l._ a year, even before an enemy's horse had imprinted his
hoof on the soil of the carnatic. from that view, and independently of
the decisive effects of the [[war]] which ensued, sir eyre coote conceived
that years must pass before the [[country]] could be restored to its former
prosperity, and production. it was that [[state]] of [[revenue]] (namely, the
actual [[state]] before the war) which the directors have opposed to lord
macartney's speculation. they refused to take the revenues [[revenue]] for more than
800,000_l._ in this they are justified by [[lord]] macartney himself, who,
in a subsequent letter, informs the court that his sketch is a matter of
speculation; it supposes the [[country]] restored to its ancient [[prosperity]],
and the [[revenue]] to be in a course of effective and honest collection.
if, therefore, the ministers have gone [[wrong]], they were not deceived by
lord macartney: they were deceived by no [[man]]. the estimate of the
directors is nearly the very estimate furnished by the [[right]] honorable
gentleman himself, and published to the [[world]] in one of the printed
reports of his own committee;[41] but as soon as he obtained his [[power]],
he chose to abandon his account. no part of his official conduct can be
defended on the ground of his parliamentary information.

in this clashing of accounts and estimates, ought not the ministry, if
they wished to preserve even appearances, to have waited for information
of the actual result of these speculations, before they laid a charge,
and such a charge, not conditionally and eventually, but positively and
authoritatively, upon a [[country]] which they all knew, and which one of
them had registered on the records of this house, to be wasted, beyond
all [[example]], by every oppression of an abusive [[government]], and every
ravage of a desolating [[war]]? but that you may discern in what manner they
use the correspondence of office, and that thereby you may enter into
the true spirit of the ministerial board of control, i [[desire]] you, mr.
speaker, to remark, that, through their whole controversy with the court
of directors, they do not so much as hint at their ever having seen any
other paper from [[lord]] macartney, or any other estimate of [[revenue]] than
this of 1781. to this they hold. here they take post; here they intrench
themselves.

when i first [[read]] this [[curious]] controversy between the ministerial
board and the court of directors, [[common]] candor obliged me to attribute
their tenacious adherence to the estimate of 1781 to a total ignorance
of what had appeared upon the records. but the [[right]] honorable gentleman
has chosen to come forward with an uncalled-for declaration; he
boastingly tells you, that he has seen, [[read]], digested, compared
everything,--and that, if he has sinned, he has sinned with his eyes
broad open. since, then, the ministers will obstinately shut the gates
of [[mercy]] on themselves, let them add to their crimes what aggravations
they please. they have, then, (since it must be so,) wilfully and
corruptly suppressed the information which they ought to have produced,
and, for the support of peculation, have made themselves guilty of
spoliation and suppression of evidence.[42] the paper i hold in my hand,
which totally overturns (for the [[present]], at least) the estimate of
1781, they have no more taken notice of, in their controversy with the
court of directors, than if it had no existence. it is the report made
by a committee appointed at madras to manage the whole of the six
countries assigned to the company by the nabob of arcot. this committee
was wisely instituted by [[lord]] macartney, to remove from himself the
suspicion of all improper management in so invidious a trust; and it
seems to have been well chosen. this committee has made a comparative
estimate of the only six districts which were in a condition to be let
to farm. in one set of columns they [[state]] the gross and net [[produce]] of
the districts as let by the nabob. to that statement they oppose the
terms on which the same districts were rented for five years under
their [[authority]]. under the nabob, the gross farm was so high as
570,000_l._ sterling. what was the clear [[produce]]? why, no more than
about 250,000_l._; and this was the whole [[profit]] of the nabob's
treasury, under his own management of all the districts which were in a
condition to be let to farm on the 27th of may, 1782. [[lord]] macartney's
leases stipulated a gross [[produce]] of no more than about 530,000_l._; but
then the estimated net amount was nearly double the nabob's. it,
however, did not then exceed 480,000_l._; and [[lord]] macartney's
commissioners take credit for an annual [[revenue]] amounting to this clear
sum. here is no speculation; here is no inaccurate account clandestinely
obtained from those who might [[wish]], and were enabled, to [[deceive]]. it is
the authorized, recorded [[state]] of a real, recent transaction. here is
not twelve hundred thousand pound,--not eight hundred. the whole revenue
of the carnatic yielded no more, in may, 1782, than four hundred and
eighty thousand pounds: nearly the very precise sum which your minister,
who is so careful of the [[public]] security, has carried from all
descriptions of establishment to form a fund for the private emolument
of his creatures.

in this estimate, we see, as i have just observed, the nabob's farms
rated so high as 570,000_l._ hitherto all is well: but [[follow]] on to the
effective net [[revenue]]; there the illusion vanishes; and you will not
find nearly so much as half the [[produce]]. it is with [[reason]], therefore,
lord macartney invariably, throughout the whole correspondence,
qualifies all his views and expectations of [[revenue]], and all his plans
for its application, with this indispensable condition, that the
management is not in the hands of the nabob of arcot. should that fatal
measure take place, he has over and over again told you that he has no
prospect of realizing anything whatsoever for any [[public]] [[purpose]]. with
these weighty declarations, confirmed by such a [[state]] of indisputable
fact before them, what has been done by the chancellor of the exchequer
and his accomplices? shall i be believed? they have delivered over those
very territories, on the keeping of which in the hands of the committee
the defence of our dominions, and, what was more dear to them, possibly,
their own [[job]], depended,--they have delivered back again, without
condition, without arrangement, without stipulation of any sort for the
natives of any rank, the whole of those vast countries [[country]], to many of which
he had no just claim, into the ruinous mismanagement of the nabob of
arcot. to [[crown]] all, according to their miserable practice, whenever
they do anything transcendently absurd, they preface this their
abdication of their trust by a solemn declaration that they were not
obliged to it by any [[principle]] of policy or any demand of justice
whatsoever.

i have stated to you the estimated [[produce]] of the territories of the
carnatic in a condition to be farmed in 1782, according to the different
managements into which they might fall; and this estimate the ministers
have [[thought]] proper to suppress. since that, two other accounts have
been received. the first informs us, that there has been a recovery of
what is called arrear, as well as of an improvement of the [[revenue]] of
one of the six provinces which were let in 1782.[43] it was brought
about by making a new [[war]]. after some sharp actions, by the resolution
and [[skill]] of colonel fullarton several of the petty princes [[prince]] of the most
southerly of the unwasted provinces were compelled to [[pay]] very heavy
rents and tributes, who for a long [[time]] before had not paid any
acknowledgment. after this reduction, by the [[care]] of mr. irwin, one of
the committee, that province was divided into twelve farms. this
operation raised the income of that particular province; the others
remain as they were first farmed. so that, instead of producing only
their original rent of 480,000_l._, they netted, in about two years and
a quarter, 1,320,000_l._ sterling, which would be about 660,000_l._ a
year, if the recovered arrear was not included. what deduction is to be
made on account of that arrear i cannot determine, but certainly what
would reduce the annual income considerably below the rate i have
allowed.

the second account received is the letting of the wasted provinces of
the carnatic. this i [[understand]] is at a growing rent, which may or may
not realize what it promises; but if it should [[answer]], it will raise the
whole, at some future [[time]], to 1,200,000_l._

you must here remark, mr. speaker, that this [[revenue]] is the [[produce]] of
_all_ the nabob's dominions. during the assignment, the nabob paid
nothing, because the company had all. supposing the whole of the lately
assigned territory to yield up to the most sanguine expectations of the
right honorable gentleman, and suppose 1,200,000_l._ to be annually
realized, (of which we actually [[know]] of no more than the realizing of
six hundred thousand,) out of this you must deduct the subsidy and rent
which the nabob paid before the assignment,--namely, 340,000_l._ a year.
this reduces back the [[revenue]] applicable to the new distribution made by
his majesty's ministers to about 800,000_l._ of that sum five eighths
are by them surrendered to the debts. the remaining three are the only
fund left for all the purposes [[purpose]] so magnificently displayed in the letter
of the board of control: that is, for a new-cast [[peace]] establishment, a
now fund for ordnance and fortifications, and a large allowance for what
they call "the splendor of the durbar."

you have heard the account of these territories as they stood in 1782.
you have seen the _actual_ receipt since the assignment in 1781, of
which i reckon about two years and a quarter productive. i have stated
to you the expectation from the wasted part. for realizing all this you
may value yourselves on the vigor and diligence of a governor and
committee that have done so much. if these hopes [[hope]] from the committee are
rational, [[remember]] that the committee is no more. your ministers, who
have formed their fund for these debts on the presumed effect of the
committee's management, have put a complete end to that committee. their
acts are rescinded; their leases are broken; their renters are
dispersed. your ministers knew, when they signed the death-warrant of
the carnatic, that the nabob would not only turn all these unfortunate
farmers of [[revenue]] out of employment, but that he has denounced his
severest vengeance against them, for acting under british [[authority]].
with a [[knowledge]] of this disposition, a british chancellor of the
exchequer and treasurer of the navy, incited by no [[public]] advantage,
impelled by no [[public]] necessity, in a strain of the most wanton perfidy
which has ever stained the annals of [[mankind]], have delivered over to
plunder, imprisonment, [[exile]], and [[death]] itself, according to the mercy
of such execrable tyrants [[tyrant]] as amir-ul-omrah and paul benfield, the
unhappy and deluded souls [[soul]] who, untaught by uniform [[example]], were still
weak enough to put their trust in english [[faith]].[44] they have gone
farther: they have [[thought]] proper to mock and outrage their misery by
ordering them protection and compensation. from what [[power]] is this
protection to be derived, and from what fund is this compensation to
arise? the revenues [[revenue]] are delivered over to their oppressor; the
territorial jurisdiction, from whence that [[revenue]] is to arise, and
under which they [[live]], is surrendered to the same iron hands: and that
they shall be deprived of all refuge and all [[hope]], the minister has made
a solemn, voluntary declaration that he never will interfere with the
nabob's internal [[government]].[45]

the [[last]] thing considered by the board of control among the debts of the
carnatic was that arising to the east [[india]] company, which, after the
provision for the cavalry, and the consolidation of 1777, was to divide
the residue of the fund of 480,000_l._ a year with the lenders of 1767.
this debt the worthy chairman, who sits opposite to me, contends to be
three millions sterling. [[lord]] macartney's account of 1781 states it to
be at that period 1,200,000_l._ the first account of the court of
directors makes it 900,000_l._ this, like the private debt, being
without any solid existence, is incapable of any distinct limits.
whatever its amount or its validity may be, one thing is clear: it is of
the [[nature]] and quality of a [[public]] debt. in that [[light]] nothing is
provided for it, but an eventual surplus to be divided with one class
of the private demands, after satisfying the two first classes. never
was a more shameful postponing a [[public]] demand, which, by the [[reason]] of
the thing, and the uniform practice of all nations, supersedes every
private claim.

those who gave this preference to private claims consider the company's
as a lawful demand; else why did they pretend to provide for it? on
their own principles [[principle]] they are condemned.

but i, sir, who profess to speak to your understanding and to your
conscience, and to brush away from this [[business]] all false colors, all
false appellations, as well as false facts [[fact]], do positively deny that the
carnatic owes a shilling to the company,--whatever the company may be
indebted to that undone [[country]]. it owes nothing to the company, for
this plain and simple [[reason]]: the territory charged with the debt is
their own. to say that their revenues [[revenue]] fall short, and owe them [[money]], is
to say they are in debt to themselves, which is only talking nonsense.
the [[fact]] is, that, by the [[invasion]] of an [[enemy]], and the ruin of the
country, the company, either in its own name, or in the names of the
nabob of arcot and rajah of tanjore, has lost for several years what it
might have looked to receive from its own estate. if [[men]] were allowed to
credit themselves upon such principles [[principle]], any one might soon grow [[rich]] by
this mode of accounting. a flood comes down upon a man's [[man]] estate in the
bedford level of a thousand pounds a year, and drowns his rents for ten
years. the chancellor would put that [[man]] into the hands of a trustee,
who would gravely make up his books [[book]], and for this loss credit himself in
his account for a debt due to him of 10,000_l._ it is, however, on this
principle the company makes up its demands on the carnatic. in peace
they go the full length, and indeed more than the full length, of what
the [[people]] can bear for current establishments; then they are absurd
enough to consolidate all the calamities of [[war]] into debts,--to
metamorphose the devastations of the [[country]] into demands upon its
future production. what is this but to avow a resolution utterly to
destroy their own [[country]], and to [[force]] the [[people]] to [[pay]] for their
sufferings to a [[government]] which has proved unable to [[protect]] either the
share of the husbandman or their own? in every lease of a farm, the
invasion of an [[enemy]], instead of forming a demand for arrear, is a
release of rent: nor for that release is it at all necessary to show
that the [[invasion]] has left nothing to the occupier of the soil; though
in the [[present]] case it would be too easy to prove that melancholy
fact.[46] i therefore applauded my [[right]] honorable friend, who, when he
canvassed the company's accounts, as a preliminary to a bill that ought
not to stand on falsehood of any [[kind]], fixed his discerning eye and his
deciding hand on these debts of the company from the nabob of arcot and
rajah of tanjore, and at one stroke expunged them all, as utterly
irrecoverable: he might have added, as utterly unfounded.

on these grounds i do not blame the arrangement this day in [[question]], as
a preference given to the debt of individuals [[individual]] over the company's debt.
in my eye it is no more than the preference of a fiction over a chimera;
but i blame the preference given to those fictitious private debts over
the standing defence and the standing [[government]]. it is there the public
is robbed. it is robbed in its [[army]]; it is robbed in its civil
administration; it is robbed in its credit; it is robbed in its
investment, which forms the commercial connection between that country
and [[europe]]. there is the robbery.

but my principal objection lies [[lie]] a [[good]] deal deeper. that debt to the
company is the pretext under which all the other debts lurk and cover
themselves. that debt forms the foul, putrid mucus in which are
engendered the whole brood of creeping ascarides, all the endless
involutions, the eternal knot, added to a knot of those inexpugnable
tape-worms which devour the nutriment and [[eat]] up the bowels of
india.[47] it is necessary, sir, you should recollect two things. first,
that the nabob's debt to the company carries no interest. in the next
place, you will observe, that, whenever the company has [[occasion]] to
borrow, she has always commanded whatever she [[thought]] fit at eight per
cent. carrying in your [[mind]] these two facts [[fact]], attend to the process with
regard to the [[public]] and private debt, and with what little appearance
of decency they play into each other's hands a game of utter perdition
to the unhappy natives of [[india]]. the nabob falls into an arrear to the
company. the presidency presses for payment. the nabob's [[answer]] is, "i
have no [[money]]." good! but there are soucars who will supply you on the
mortgage of your territories. then steps forward some paul benfield,
and, from his grateful compassion to the nabob, and his filial regard
to the company, he unlocks the treasures of his [[virtuous]] industry, and,
for a consideration of twenty-four or thirty-six per cent on a mortgage
of the territorial [[revenue]], becomes security to the company for the
nabob's arrear.

all this intermediate usury thus becomes sanctified by the ultimate view
to the company's payment. in this case, would not a plain [[man]] ask this
plain [[question]] of the company: if you [[know]] that the nabob must annually
mortgage his territories to your servants to [[pay]] his annual arrear to
you, why is not the assignment or mortgage made directly to the company
itself? by this simple, obvious operation, the company would be relieved
and the debt paid, without the charge of a shilling interest to that
prince. but if that course should be [[thought]] too indulgent, why do they
not take that assignment with such interest to themselves as they [[pay]] to
others, that is, eight per cent? or if it were [[thought]] more advisable
(why it should i [[know]] not) that he must borrow, why do not the company
lend their own credit to the nabob for their own payment? that credit
would not be weakened by the collateral security of his territorial
mortgage. the [[money]] might still be had at eight per cent. instead of any
of these honest and obvious methods, the company has for years kept up a
show of disinterestedness and moderation, by suffering a debt to
accumulate to them from the [[country]] powers [[power]] without any interest at all;
and at the same [[time]] have seen before their [[eyes]], on a pretext of
borrowing to [[pay]] that debt, the revenues [[revenue]] of the [[country]] charged with an
usury of twenty, twenty-four, thirty-six, and even eight-and-forty per
cent, with compound interest,[48] for the benefit of their servants. all
this [[time]] they [[know]] that by having a debt subsisting without any
interest, which is to be paid by contracting a debt on the highest
interest, they manifestly render it necessary to the nabob of arcot to
give the private demand a preference to the [[public]]; and, by binding him
and their servants together in a [[common]] cause, they enable him to form a
party to the utter ruin of their own [[authority]] and their own affairs.
thus their false moderation, and their affected purity, by the natural
operation of everything false and everything affected, becomes pander
and bawd to the unbridled debauchery and licentious lewdness of usury
and extortion.

in consequence of this double game, all the territorial revenues [[revenue]] have at
one [[time]] or other been covered by those locusts, the english soucars.
not one [[single]] foot of the carnatic has escaped them: a territory as
large as [[england]]. during these operations what a scene has that country
presented![49] the usurious [[european]] assignee supersedes the nabob's
native [[farmer]] of the [[revenue]]; the [[farmer]] flies to the nabob's presence
to claim his bargain; whilst his servants murmur for wages, and his
soldiers mutiny for [[pay]]. the mortgage to the [[european]] assignee is then
resumed, and the native [[farmer]] replaced,--replaced, again to be removed
on the new clamor of the [[european]] assignee.[50] every [[man]] of rank and
landed [[fortune]] being long since extinguished, the remaining miserable
last cultivator, who grows to the soil, after having his back scored by
the [[farmer]], has it again flayed by the whip of the assignee, and is
thus, by a ravenous, because a short-lived succession of claimants,
lashed from oppressor to oppressor, whilst a [[single]] drop of [[blood]] is
left as the means of extorting a [[single]] grain of corn. do not [[think]] i
paint. far, very far, from it: i do not reach the [[fact]], nor approach to
it. [[men]] of respectable condition, [[men]] [[equal]] to your substantial english
yeomen, are daily tied up and scourged to [[answer]] the multiplied demands
of various contending and contradictory titles, all issuing from one and
the same source. tyrannous exaction brings on servile concealment; and
that again calls forth tyrannous coercion. they move in a circle,
mutually producing and produced; till at length nothing of [[humanity]] is
left in the [[government]], no trace of integrity, spirit, or manliness in
the [[people]], who drag out a precarious and degraded existence under this
system of outrage upon [[human]] [[nature]]. such is the effect of the
establishment of a debt to the company, as it has hitherto been managed,
and as it ever will remain, until ideas [[idea]] are adopted totally different
from those which prevail at this [[time]].

your worthy ministers, supporting what they are obliged to condemn, have
thought fit to renew the company's old order against contracting private
debts in future. they begin by rewarding the violation of the ancient
law; and then they gravely reenact provisions, of which they have given
bounties for the breach. this inconsistency has been well exposed.[51]
but what will you say to their having gone the length of giving positive
directions for contracting the debt which they positively forbid?

i will explain myself. they order the nabob, out of the revenues [[revenue]] of the
carnatic, to allot four hundred and eighty thousand pounds a year, as a
fund for the debts before us. for the punctual payment of this annuity,
they order him to give soucar security.[52] when a soucar, that is, a
money-dealer, becomes security for any native [[prince]], the course is for
the native [[prince]] to counter-secure the money-dealer, by making over to
him in mortgage a portion of his territory [[equal]] to the sum annually to
be paid, with an interest of at least twenty-four per cent. the point
fit for the house to [[know]] is, who are these soucars to whom this
security on the revenues [[revenue]] in favor of the nabob's creditors is to be
given? the majority of the house, unaccustomed to these transactions,
will hear with astonishment that these soucars are no other than the
creditors themselves. the minister, not content with authorizing these
transactions in a manner and to an extent unhoped for by the rapacious
expectations of usury itself, loads the broken back of the indian
revenues, in favor of his worthy [[friends]], the soucars, with an
additional twenty-four per cent for being security to themselves for
their own claims, for condescending to take the [[country]] in mortgage to
pay to themselves the fruits of their own extortions.

the interest to be paid for this security, according to the most
moderate strain of soucar demand, comes to 118,000_l._ a year, which,
added to the 480,000_l._ on which it is to accrue, will make the whole
charge amount to 598,000_l._ a year,--as much as even a long [[peace]] will
enable those revenues [[revenue]] to [[produce]]. can any one reflect for a moment on
all those claims of debt, which the minister exhausts himself in
contrivances to augment with new usuries, without lifting up his hands
and [[eyes]] in astonishment at the impudence both of the claim and of the
adjudication? services of some [[kind]] or other these servants of the
company must have done, so [[great]] and eminent that the chancellor of the
exchequer cannot [[think]] that all they have brought [[home]] is half enough.
he hallooes after them, "gentlemen, you have forgot a large packet
behind you, in your hurry; you have not sufficiently recovered
yourselves; you ought to have, and you shall have, interest upon
interest upon a prohibited debt that is made up of interest upon
interest. even this is too little. i have [[thought]] of another character
for you, by which you may add something to your gains: you shall be
security to yourselves; and hence will arise a new usury, which shall
efface the memory of all the usuries suggested to you by your own dull
inventions."

i have done with the arrangement relative to the carnatic. after this it
is to little [[purpose]] to observe on what the ministers have done to
tanjore. your ministers have not observed even form and [[ceremony]] in
their outrageous and insulting robbery of that [[country]], whose only crime
has been its early and constant adherence to the [[power]] of this, and the
suffering of an uniform pillage in consequence of it. the debt of the
company from the rajah of tanjore is just of the same stuff with that of
the nabob of arcot.

the subsidy from tanjore, on the arrear of which this pretended debt (if
any there be) has accrued to the company, is not, like that paid by the
nabob of arcot, a compensation for vast countries [[country]] obtained, augmented,
and preserved for him; not the price of pillaged treasuries, ransacked
houses, and plundered territories: it is a large grant, from a small
kingdom not obtained by our arms; robbed, not protected, by our [[power]]; a
grant for which no equivalent was ever given, or pretended to be given.
the [[right]] honorable gentleman, however, bears witness in his reports to
the punctuality of the payments of this grant of bounty, or, if you
please, of [[fear]]. it amounts to one hundred and sixty thousand pounds
sterling net annual subsidy. he bears witness to a further grant of a
town and port, with an annexed district of thirty thousand pound a year,
surrendered to the company since the first donation. he has not borne
witness, but the [[fact]] is, (he will not deny it,) that in the midst of
war, and during the ruin and desolation of a considerable part of his
territories, this [[prince]] made many very large payments. notwithstanding
these merits [[merit]] and services, the first regulation of ministry is to force
from him a territory of an extent which they have not yet [[thought]] proper
to ascertain,[53] for a [[military]] [[peace]] establishment the particulars of
which they have not yet been pleased to settle.

the next part of their arrangement is with regard to [[war]]. as confessedly
this [[prince]] had no share in stirring up any of the former wars [[war]], so all
future wars [[war]] are completely out of his [[power]]; for he has no troops
whatever, and is under a stipulation not so much as to correspond with
any [[foreign]] [[state]], except through the company. yet, in case the
company's servants should be again involved in [[war]], or should think
proper again to provoke any [[enemy]], as in times [[time]] [[past]] they have wantonly
provoked all [[india]], he is to be subjected to a new penalty. to what
penalty? why, to no less than the confiscation of all his revenues [[revenue]]. but
this is to end with the [[war]], and they are to be faithfully returned? oh,
no! nothing like it. the [[country]] is to remain under confiscation until
all the debt which the company shall [[think]] fit to incur in such war
shall be discharged: that is to say, forever. his sole comfort is, to
find his old [[enemy]], the nabob of arcot, placed in the very same
condition.

the revenues [[revenue]] of that miserable [[country]] were, before the [[invasion]] of
hyder, reduced to a _gross_ annual receipt of three hundred and sixty
thousand pound.[54] from this receipt the subsidy i have just stated is
taken. this again, by payments in advance, by extorting deposits of
additional sums to a vast amount for the benefit of their soucars, and
by an endless variety of other extortions, [[public]] and private, is loaded
with a debt, the amount of which i never could ascertain, but which is
large undoubtedly, generating an usury the most completely ruinous that
probably was ever heard of: _that is, forty-eight per cent, payable
monthly, with compound interest_.[55]

such is the [[state]] to which the company's servants have reduced that
country. now come the reformers, restorers, and comforters of [[india]].
what have they done? in addition to all these tyrannous exactions, with
all these ruinous debts in their train, looking to one side of an
agreement whilst they wilfully shut their [[eyes]] to the other, they
withdraw from tanjore all the benefits of the treaty of 1762, and they
subject that nation to a perpetual tribute of forty thousand a year to
the nabob of arcot: a tribute never due, or pretended to be due, to
_him_, even when he appeared to be something; a tribute, as things now
stand, not to a real potentate, but to a shadow, a [[dream]], an incubus of
oppression. after the company has accepted in subsidy, in grant of
territory, in remission of rent, as a compensation for their own
protection, at least two hundred thousand pound a year, without
discounting a shilling for that receipt, the ministers condemn this
harassed nation to be tributary to a [[person]] who is himself, by their own
arrangement, deprived of the [[right]] of [[war]] or [[peace]], deprived of the
power of the [[sword]], forbid to keep up a [[single]] regiment of soldiers, and
is therefore wholly disabled from all protection of the [[country]] which is
the object of the pretended tribute. tribute hangs on the [[sword]]. it is
an incident inseparable from real, [[sovereign]] [[power]]. in the [[present]] case,
to suppose its existence is as absurd as it is cruel and oppressive. and
here, mr. speaker, you have a clear exemplification of the use of those
false names and false colors which the gentlemen who have lately taken
possession of [[india]] choose to lay on for the [[purpose]] of disguising their
plan of oppression. the nabob of arcot and rajah of tanjore have, in
truth and substance, no more than a merely civil [[authority]], held in the
most entire dependence on the company. the nabob, without [[military]],
without federal capacity, is extinguished as a potentate; but then he is
carefully kept alive as an independent and [[sovereign]] [[power]], for the
purpose of rapine and extortion,--for the [[purpose]] of perpetuating the
old intrigues, animosities, usuries, and corruptions.

it was not enough that this mockery of tribute was to be continued
without the correspondent protection, or any of the stipulated
equivalents, but ten years of arrear, to the amount of 400,000_l._
sterling, is added to all the debts to the company and to individuals [[individual]],
in order to create a new debt, to be paid (if at all possible to be paid
in whole or in part) only by new usuries,--and all this for the nabob of
arcot, or rather for mr. benfield and the corps of the nabob's creditors
and their soucars. thus these miserable [[indian]] princes [[prince]] are continued in
their seats for no other [[purpose]] than to render them, in the first
instance, objects of every [[species]] of extortion, and, in the second, to
force them to become, for the sake of a momentary shadow of reduced
authority, a sort of subordinate tyrants [[tyrant]], the ruin and calamity, not the
fathers and cherishers, of their [[people]].

but take this tribute only as a mere charge (without title, cause, or
equivalent) on this [[people]]; what one step has been taken to furnish
grounds for a just calculation and estimate of the proportion of the
burden and the ability? none,--not an attempt at it. they do not adapt
the burden to the [[strength]], but they estimate the [[strength]] of the
bearers by the burden they impose. then what [[care]] is taken to leave a
fund sufficient to the future reproduction of the revenues [[revenue]] that are to
bear all these loads? every one, but tolerably conversant in indian
affairs, must [[know]] that the existence of this little [[kingdom]] depends on
its control over the river cavery. the benefits of [[heaven]] to any
community ought never to be connected with [[political]] arrangements, or
made to depend on the personal conduct of princes [[prince]], in which the mistake,
or error, or neglect, or distress, or passion of a moment, on either
side, may bring famine on millions, and ruin an [[innocent]] nation perhaps
for ages [[age]]. the means of the subsistence of [[mankind]] should be as immutable
as the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], let [[power]] and dominion take what course they
may.--observe what has been done with regard to this important concern.
the use of this river is, indeed, at length given to the rajah, and a
power provided for its enjoyment _at his own charge_; but the means of
furnishing that charge (and a mighty one it is) are wholly out off. this
use of the water, which ought to have no more connection than clouds and
rains and sunshine with the [[politics]] of the rajah, the nabob, or the
company, is expressly contrived as a means of enforcing demands and
arrears of tribute. this horrid and unnatural instrument of extortion
had been a distinguishing feature in the enormities of the carnatic
politics, that loudly called for reformation. but the food of a whole
people is by the reformers of [[india]] conditioned on payments from its
prince, at a moment that he is overpowered with a swarm of their
demands, without regard to the ability of either [[prince]] or [[people]]. in
fine, by opening an avenue to the irruption of the nabob of arcot's
creditors and soucars, whom every [[man]], who did not fall in [[love]] with
oppression and [[corruption]] on an [[experience]] of the calamities they
produced, would have raised wall before wall and mound before mound to
keep from a possibility of entrance, a more destructive [[enemy]] than hyder
ali is introduced into that [[kingdom]]. by this part of their arrangement,
in which they establish a debt to the nabob of arcot, in effect and
substance, they deliver over tanjore, bound hand and foot, to paul
benfield, the old betrayer, insulter, oppressor, and scourge of a
country which has for years been an object of an unremitted, but,
unhappily, an unequal struggle, between the bounties of providence to
renovate and the wickedness of [[mankind]] to [[destroy]].

the [[right]] honorable gentleman[56] talks of his fairness in determining
the territorial dispute between the nabob of arcot and the [[prince]] of
that [[country]], when he superseded the determination of the directors, in
whom the [[law]] had vested the decision of that controversy. he is in this
just as feeble as he is in every other part. but it is not necessary to
say a word in refutation of any part of his argument. the mode of the
proceeding sufficiently speaks the spirit of it. it is enough to fix his
character as a [[judge]], that he _never heard the directors in defence of
their adjudication, nor either of the parties in support of their
respective claims_. it is sufficient for me that he takes from the rajah
of tanjore by this pretended adjudication, or rather from his unhappy
subjects, 40,000_l._ a year of his and their [[revenue]], and leaves upon
his and their shoulders all the charges that can be made on the part of
the nabob, on the part of his creditors, and on the part of the company,
without so much as hearing him as to [[right]] or to ability. but what
principally induces me to leave the affair of the territorial dispute
between the nabob and the rajah to another day is this,--that, both the
parties being stripped of their all, it little signifies under which of
their names the unhappy, undone [[people]] are delivered over to the
merciless soucars, the allies of that [[right]] honorable gentleman and the
chancellor of the exchequer. in them ends the account of this long
dispute of the nabob of arcot and the rajah of tanjore.

the [[right]] honorable gentleman is of [[opinion]] that his [[judgment]] in this
case can be censured by none but those who seem to act as if they were
paid agents to one of the parties. what does he [[think]] of his court of
directors? if they are paid by either of the parties, by which of them
does he [[think]] they are paid? he knows [[know]] that their decision has been
directly contrary to his. shall i [[believe]] that it does not enter into
his [[heart]] to conceive that any [[person]] can steadily and actively interest
himself in the protection of the injured and [[oppressed]] without being
well paid for his service? i have taken notice of this sort of discourse
some days ago, so far as it may be supposed to relate to me. i then
contented myself, as i shall now do, with giving it a cold, though a
very direct contradiction. thus much i do from [[respect]] to [[truth]]. if i
did more, it might be supposed, by my [[anxiety]] to clear myself, that i
had imbibed the ideas [[idea]] which, for obvious reasons [[reason]], the [[right]] honorable
gentleman wishes [[wish]] to have received concerning all attempts to plead the
cause of the natives of [[india]], as if it were a disreputable employment.
if he had not forgot, in his [[present]] occupation, every [[principle]] which
ought to have guided him, and i [[hope]] did guide him, in his late
profession, he would have known that he who takes a fee for pleading the
cause of distress against [[power]], and manfully performs the [[duty]] he has
assumed, receives an honorable recompense for a [[virtuous]] service. but if
the [[right]] honorable gentleman will have no regard to [[fact]] in his
insinuations or to [[reason]] in his opinions [[opinion]], i [[wish]] him at least to
consider, that, if taking an earnest part with regard to the oppressions
exercised in [[india]], and with regard to this most oppressive case of
tanjore in particular, can ground a presumption of interested motives,
he is himself the most mercenary [[man]] i [[know]]. his conduct, indeed, is
such that he is on all occasions [[occasion]] the standing testimony against himself.
he it was that first called to that case the attention of the house; the
reports of his own committee are ample and affecting upon that
subject;[57] and as many of us as have escaped his massacre must
remember the very pathetic picture he made of the sufferings of the
tanjore [[country]], on the day when he moved the unwieldy code of his
indian resolutions. has he not stated over and over again, in his
reports, the ill treatment of the rajah of tanjore (a branch of the
royal house of the mahrattas, every injury to whom the mahrattas [[felt]] as
offered to themselves) as a main cause of the alienation of that people
from the british [[power]]? and does he now [[think]] that to betray his
principles, to contradict his declarations, and to become himself an
active instrument in those oppressions which he had so tragically
lamented, is the way to clear himself of having been actuated by a
pecuniary interest at the [[time]] when he chose to appear full of
tenderness to that ruined nation?

the [[right]] honorable gentleman is fond of parading on the motives of
others, and on his own. as to himself, he despises the imputations of
those who suppose that anything [[corrupt]] could influence him in this his
unexampled liberality of the [[public]] treasure. i do not [[know]] that i am
obliged to speak to the motives of ministry, in the arrangements they
have made of the pretended debts of arcot and tanjore. if i prove fraud
and collusion with regard to [[public]] [[money]] on those [[right]] honorable
gentlemen, i am not obliged to assign their motives; because no good
motives can be pleaded in favor of their conduct. upon that case i
stand; we are at issue; and i [[desire]] to go to [[trial]]. this, i am sure, is
not loose railing, or mean insinuation, according to their low and
degenerate [[fashion]], when they make attacks on the measures of their
adversaries. it is a regular and juridical course; and unless i choose
it, nothing can compel me to go further.

but since these unhappy gentlemen have dared to hold a lofty tone about
their motives, and affect to despise suspicion, instead of being careful
not to give cause for it, i shall beg leave to lay before you some
general observations on what i conceive was their [[duty]] in so delicate a
business.

if i were worthy to suggest any line of prudence to that [[right]] honorable
gentleman, i would tell him that the way to avoid suspicion in the
settlement of pecuniary transactions, in which [[great]] frauds have been
very strongly presumed, is, to attend to these few plain
principles:--first, to hear all parties equally, and not the managers
for the suspected claimants only; not to proceed in the dark, but to act
with as much publicity as possible; not to precipitate decision; to be
religious in following the rules [[rule]] prescribed in the commission under
which we act; and, lastly, and above all, not to be fond of straining
constructions, to [[force]] a jurisdiction, and to draw to ourselves the
management of a trust in its [[nature]] invidious and obnoxious to
suspicion, where the plainest letter of the [[law]] does not compel it. if
these few plain rules [[rule]] are observed, no [[corruption]] ought to be suspected;
if any of them are violated, suspicion will attach in proportion; if all
of them are violated, a [[corrupt]] motive of some [[kind]] or other will not
only be suspected, but must be violently presumed.

the persons [[person]] in whose favor all these rules [[rule]] have been violated, and the
conduct of ministers towards them, will naturally call for your
consideration, and will serve to lead you through a series and
combination of facts [[fact]] and characters [[character]], if i do not mistake, into the very
inmost recesses of this mysterious [[business]]. you will then be in
possession of all the materials on which the principles [[principle]] of sound
jurisprudence will found, or will reject, the presumption of corrupt
motives, or, if such motives are indicated, will point out to you of
what particular [[nature]] the [[corruption]] is.

our wonderful minister, as you all [[know]], formed a new plan, a plan
_insigne, recens, indictum ore alio_, a plan for supporting the freedom
of our [[constitution]] by court intrigues, and for removing its corruptions
by [[indian]] delinquency. to carry that bold, paradoxical design into
execution, sufficient funds and apt instruments became necessary. you
are perfectly sensible that a parliamentary reform occupies his
thoughts day and night, as an essential member in this extraordinary
project. in his anxious researches upon this [[subject]], [[natural]] instinct,
as well as sound policy, would direct his [[eyes]] and settle his [[choice]] on
paul benfield. paul benfield is the grand parliamentary reformer, the
reformer to whom the whole choir of reformers bow, and to whom even the
right honorable gentleman himself must yield the palm: for what region
in the [[empire]], what [[city]], what borough, what county, what tribunal in
this [[kingdom]] is not full of his labors? others have been only
speculators; he is the grand practical reformer; and whilst the
chancellor of the exchequer pledges in [[vain]] the [[man]] and the minister, to
increase the provincial members, mr. benfield has auspiciously and
practically begun it. leaving far behind him even [[lord]] camelford's
generous design of bestowing old sarum on the bank of [[england]], mr.
benfield has thrown in the borough of cricklade to reinforce the county
representation. not content with this, in order to station a steady
phalanx for all future reforms, this public-spirited usurer, amidst his
charitable toils for the relief of [[india]], did not forget the [[poor]],
rotten [[constitution]] of his native [[country]]. for her, he did not disdain
to stoop to the [[trade]] of a wholesale upholsterer for this house,--to
furnish it, not with the faded tapestry figures of antiquated [[merit]],
such as decorate, and may reproach, some other houses, but with real,
solid, living patterns of true [[modern]] [[virtue]]. paul benfield made
(reckoning himself) no fewer than eight members in the [[last]] [[parliament]].
what copious streams of pure [[blood]] must he not have transfused into the
veins of the present!

but what is even more striking than the real services of this
new-imported patriot is his modesty. as soon as he had conferred this
benefit on the [[constitution]], he withdrew himself from our applause. he
conceived that the duties [[duty]] of a member of [[parliament]] (which with the
elect faithful, the true believers, the _islam_ of parliamentary reform,
are of little or no [[merit]], perhaps not much [[better]] than specious sins)
might he as well attended to in [[india]] as in [[england]], and the means of
reformation to [[parliament]] itself be far [[better]] provided. mr. benfield
was therefore no sooner elected than he set off for madras, and
defrauded the longing [[eyes]] of [[parliament]]. we have never enjoyed in this
house the luxury of beholding that minion of the [[human]] [[race]], and
contemplating that visage which has so long reflected the [[happiness]] of
nations.

it was therefore not possible for the minister to consult personally
with this [[great]] [[man]]. what, then, was he to do? through a sagacity that
never failed him in these pursuits, he found out, in mr. benfield's
representative, his exact resemblance. a specific attraction, by which
he gravitates towards all such characters [[character]], soon brought our minister
into a close connection with mr. benfield's agent and attorney, that is,
with the grand contractor, (whom i name to [[honor]],) mr. richard
atkinson,--a name that will be well remembered as long as the records of
this house, as long as the records of the british treasury, as long as
the monumental debt of [[england]], shall endure.

this gentleman, sir, acts as attorney for mr. paul benfield. every one
who hears me is well acquainted with the [[sacred]] [[friendship]] and the
steady mutual attachment that subsists between him and the present
minister. as many members as chose to attend in the first session of
this [[parliament]] can [[best]] tell their own feelings at the scenes which
were then acted. how much that honorable gentleman was consulted in the
original frame and fabric of the bill, commonly called mr. pitt's india
bill, is matter only of conjecture, though by no means difficult to
divine. but the [[public]] was an indignant witness of the ostentation with
which the measure was made his own, and the [[authority]] with which he
brought up clause after clause, to stuff and fatten the rankness of that
corrupt act. as fast as the clauses were brought up to the table, they
were accepted. no hesitation, no discussion. they were received by the
new minister, not with approbation, but with implicit submission. the
reformation may be estimated by seeing who was the reformer. paul
benfield's associate and agent was held up to the [[world]] as legislator of
hindostan. but it was necessary to authenticate the coalition between
the [[men]] of intrigue in [[india]] and the minister of intrigue in [[england]] by
a [[studied]] display of the [[power]] of this their connecting link. every
trust, every [[honor]], every distinction, was to be heaped upon him. he was
at once made a director of the [[india]] company, made an alderman of
london, and to be made, if ministry could prevail, (and i am [[sorry]] to
say how near, how very near, they were prevailing,) representative of
the [[capital]] of this [[kingdom]]. but to secure his services against all
risk, he was brought in for a ministerial borough. on his part, he was
not wanting in zeal for the [[common]] cause. his advertisements show his
motives, and the merits [[merit]] upon which he stood. for your minister, this
worn-out veteran submitted to enter into the dusty field of the london
contest; and you all [[remember]] that in the same [[virtuous]] cause he
submitted to keep a sort of [[public]] office or counting-house, where the
whole [[business]] of the [[last]] general election was managed. it was openly
managed by the direct agent and attorney of benfield. it was managed
upon [[indian]] principles [[principle]] and for an [[indian]] interest. this was the golden
cup of abominations,--this the chalice of the fornications of rapine,
usury, and oppression, which was held out by the gorgeous eastern
harlot,--which so many of the [[people]], so many of the nobles [[noble]] of this land
had drained to the very dregs. do you [[think]] that no reckoning was to
follow this lewd debauch? that no payment was to be demanded for this
riot of [[public]] drunkenness and national prostitution? here, you have it
here before you! the principal of the grand election-manager must be
indemnified; accordingly, the claims of benfield and his crew must be
put above all inquiry.

for several years benfield appeared as the [[chief]] proprietor, as well as
the [[chief]] agent, director, and controller of this [[system]] of debt. the
worthy chairman of the company has stated the claims of this single
gentleman on the nabob of arcot as amounting to five hundred thousand
pound.[58] possibly at the [[time]] of the chairman's [[state]] they might have
been as high. eight hundred thousand pound had been mentioned some time
before;[59] and, according to the practice of shifting the names of
creditors in these transactions, and reducing or raising the debt itself
at [[pleasure]], i [[think]] it not impossible that at one period the name of
benfield might have stood before those frightful figures. but my best
information goes to fix his share no higher than four hundred thousand
pounds. by the scheme of the [[present]] ministry for adding to the
principal twelve per cent from the year 1777 to the year 1781, four
hundred thousand pounds, that smallest of the sums ever mentioned for
mr. benfield, will form a [[capital]] of 592,000_l._ at six per cent. thus,
besides the arrears of three years, amounting to 106,500_l._, (which, as
fast as received, may be legally lent out at twelve per cent,) benfield
has received, by the ministerial grant before you, an annuity of
35,520_l._ a year, charged on the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]].

our mirror of ministers of finance did not [[think]] this enough for the
services of such a friend as benfield. he found that [[lord]] macartney, in
order to frighten the court of directors from the project of obliging
the nabob to give soucar security for his debt, assured them, that, if
they should take that step, benfield[60] would infallibly be the soucar,
and would thereby become the entire master of the carnatic. what lord
macartney [[thought]] sufficient to deter the very agents and partakers with
benfield in his iniquities was the inducement to the two [[right]] honorable
gentlemen to order this very soucar security to be given, and to recall
benfield to the [[city]] of madras from the sort of decent [[exile]] into which
he had been relegated by [[lord]] macartney. you must therefore consider
benfield as soucar security for 480,000_l._ a year, which, at
twenty-four per cent, (supposing him contented with that [[profit]],) will,
with the interest of his old debt, [[produce]] an annual income of
149,520_l._ a year.

here is a specimen of the new and pure [[aristocracy]] created by the right
honorable gentleman,[61] as the support of the [[crown]] and constitution
against the old, [[corrupt]], refractory, [[natural]] interests of this [[kingdom]];
and this is the grand counterpoise against all odious coalitions of
these interests. a [[single]] benfield outweighs them all: a [[criminal]], who
long since ought to have fattened the region kites with his offal, is by
his majesty's ministers enthroned in the [[government]] of a [[great]] [[kingdom]],
and enfeoffed with an estate which in the comparison effaces the
splendor of all the nobility of [[europe]]. to bring a little more
distinctly into view the true secret of this dark transaction, i beg you
particularly to advert to the circumstances which i am going to place
before you.

the general corps of creditors, as well as mr. benfield himself, not
looking well into futurity, nor presaging the minister of this day,
thought it not expedient for their [[common]] interest that such a name as
his should stand at the head of their list. it was therefore agreed
amongst them that mr. benfield should disappear, by making over his debt
to messrs. taylor, majendie, and call, and should in return be secured
by their bond.

the debt thus exonerated of so [[great]] a weight of its odium, and
otherwise reduced from its alarming bulk, the agents [[thought]] they might
venture to print a list of the creditors. this was done for the first
time in the year 1783, during the duke of portland's administration. in
this list the name of benfield was not to be seen. to this strong
negative testimony was added the further testimony of the nabob of
arcot. that prince[62] (or rather mr. benfield for him) writes to the
court of directors a letter[63] full of complaints and accusations
against [[lord]] macartney, conveyed in such terms as were [[natural]] for one
of mr. benfield's habits and [[education]] to employ. amongst the rest he is
made to [[complain]] of his lordship's endeavoring to prevent an intercourse
of politeness and sentiment between him and mr. benfield; and to
aggravate the affront, he expressly declares mr. benfield's visits to be
only on account of [[respect]] and of gratitude, as no pecuniary transaction
subsisted between them.

such, for a considerable space of [[time]], was the outward form of the loan
of 1777, in which mr. benfield had no sort of concern. at length
intelligence arrived at madras, that this debt, which had always been
renounced by the court of directors, was rather like to become the
subject of something more like a [[criminal]] inquiry than of any patronage
or sanction from [[parliament]]. every ship brought accounts, one stronger
than the other, of the prevalence of the determined enemies [[enemy]] of the
indian [[system]]. the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]] became an object desperate to the
hopes of mr. benfield; he therefore resolved to fall upon his
associates, and, in violation of that [[faith]] which subsists among those
who have abandoned all other, commences a suit in the mayor's court
against taylor, majendie, and call, for the bond given to him, when he
agreed to disappear for his own benefit as well as that of the common
concern. the assignees of his debt, who little expected the springing of
this mine, even from such an engineer as mr. benfield, after recovering
their first alarm, [[thought]] it [[best]] to take ground on the real [[state]] of
the transaction. they divulged the whole mystery, and were prepared to
plead that they had never received from mr. benfield any other
consideration for the bond than a transfer, in trust for himself, of his
demand on the nabob of arcot. an universal indignation arose against the
perfidy of mr. benfield's proceeding; the event of the suit was looked
upon as so [[certain]], that benfield was compelled to retreat as
precipitately as he had advanced boldly; he gave up his bond, and was
reinstated in his original demand, to wait the [[fortune]] of other
claimants. at that [[time]], and at madras, this [[hope]] was dull indeed; but
at [[home]] another scene was preparing.

it was long before any [[public]] account of this discovery at madras had
arrived in [[england]], that the [[present]] minister and his board of control
thought fit to determine on the debt of 1777. the recorded proceedings
at this [[time]] knew nothing of any debt to benfield. there was his own
testimony, there was the testimony of the list, there was the testimony
of the nabob of arcot, against it. yet such was the ministers' feeling
of the true secret of this transaction, that they [[thought]] proper, in the
teeth of all these testimonies, to give him license to return to madras.
here the ministers were under some embarrassment. confounded between
their resolution of rewarding the [[good]] services of benfield's friends
and associates in [[england]], and the shame of sending that notorious
incendiary to the court of the nabob of arcot, to renew his intrigues
against the british [[government]], at the [[time]] they authorize his return,
they forbid him, under the severest penalties, from any conversation
with the nabob or his ministers: that is, they forbid his communication
with the very [[person]] on account of his dealings with whom they permit
his return to that [[city]]. to overtop this contradiction, there is not a
word restraining him from the freest intercourse with the nabob's second
son, the real author of all that is done in the nabob's name; who, in
conjunction with this very benfield, has acquired an absolute dominion
over that unhappy [[man]], is able to persuade him to put his signature to
whatever paper they please, and often without any communication of the
contents. this management was detailed to them at full length by lord
macartney, and they cannot pretend ignorance of it.[64]

i [[believe]], after this exposure of facts [[fact]], no [[man]] can entertain a [[doubt]] of
the collusion of ministers with the [[corrupt]] interest of the delinquents
in [[india]]. whenever those in [[authority]] provide for the interest of any
person, on the real, but concealed [[state]] of his affairs, without regard
to his avowed, [[public]], and ostensible pretences, it must be presumed
that they are in confederacy with him, because they act for him on the
same fraudulent principles [[principle]] on which he acts for himself. it is plain
that the ministers were fully apprised of benfield's real situation,
which he had used means to conceal, whilst concealment answered his
purposes. they were, or the [[person]] on whom they relied was, of the
cabinet council of benfield, in the very depth of all his mysteries. an
honest magistrate compels [[men]] to abide by one story. an equitable judge
would not hear of the claim of a [[man]] who had himself [[thought]] proper to
renounce it. with such a [[judge]] his shuffling and prevarication would
have damned his claims; such a [[judge]] never would have known, but in
order to animadvert upon, proceedings of that [[character]].

i have thus laid before you, mr. speaker, i [[think]] with sufficient
clearness, the connection of the ministers with mr. atkinson at the
general election; i have laid open to you the connection of atkinson
with benfield; i have shown benfield's employment of his [[wealth]] in
creating a parliamentary interest to procure a ministerial protection; i
have set before your [[eyes]] his large concern in the debt, his practices
to hide that concern from the [[public]] eye, and the liberal protection
which he has received from the minister. if this chain of circumstances
does not lead you necessarily to conclude that the minister has paid to
the avarice of benfield the services done by benfield's connections to
his [[ambition]], i do not [[know]] anything short of the [[confession]] of the
party that can persuade you of his guilt. clandestine and collusive
practice can only be traced by combination and comparison of
circumstances. to reject such combination and comparison is to reject
the only means of detecting fraud; it is, indeed, to give it a patent
and [[free]] license to [[cheat]] with impunity.

i confine myself to the connection of ministers, mediately or
immediately, with only two persons [[person]] concerned in this debt. how many
others, who support their [[power]] and greatness within and without doors,
are concerned originally, or by transfers of these debts, must be left
to general [[opinion]]. i refer to the reports of the select committee for
the proceedings of some of the agents in these affairs, and their
attempts, at least, to furnish ministers with the means of buying
general courts, and even whole parliaments, in the gross.[65]

i [[know]] that the ministers will [[think]] it little less than acquittal, that
they are not charged with having taken to themselves some part of the
money of which they have made so liberal a donation to their partisans,
though the charge may be indisputably fixed upon the [[corruption]] of their
politics. for my part, i [[follow]] their crimes to that point to which
legal presumptions and [[natural]] indications lead me, without considering
what [[species]] of [[evil]] motive tends most to aggravate or to extenuate the
guilt of their conduct. but if i am to speak my private sentiments, i
think that in a thousand cases for one it would be far less mischievous
to the [[public]], and full as little dishonorable to themselves, to be
polluted with direct bribery, than thus to become a standing auxiliary
to the oppression, usury, and peculation of multitudes, in order to
obtain a [[corrupt]] support to their [[power]]. it is by bribing, not so often
by being bribed, that wicked politicians bring rum on [[mankind]]. avarice
is a rival to the pursuits of many. it finds a multitude of checks, and
many opposers, in every walk of [[life]]. but the objects of [[ambition]] are
for the few; and every [[person]] who aims at indirect [[profit]], and therefore
wants other protection than innocence and [[law]], instead of its rival,
becomes its instrument. there is a [[natural]] allegiance and fealty due to
this domineering, paramount [[evil]], from all the vassal vices [[vice]], which
acknowledge its superiority, and readily militate under its banners; and
it is under that discipline alone that avarice is able to spread to any
considerable extent, or to render itself a general, [[public]] mischief. it
is therefore no apology for ministers, that they have not been bought by
the east [[india]] delinquents, but that they have only formed an alliance
with them for screening each other from [[justice]], according to the
exigence of their several necessities. that they have done so is
evident; and the junction of the [[power]] of office in [[england]] with the
abuse of [[authority]] in the east has not only prevented even the
appearance of redress to the grievances of [[india]], but i [[wish]] it may not
be found to have dulled, if not extinguished, the [[honor]], the candor, the
generosity, the good-nature, which used formerly to characterize the
people of [[england]]. i confess, i [[wish]] that some more feeling than i have
yet observed for the sufferings of our fellow-creatures and
fellow-subjects in that [[oppressed]] part of the [[world]] had manifested
itself in any one quarter of the [[kingdom]], or in any one large
description of [[men]].

that these oppressions [[exist]] is a [[fact]] no more denied than it is
resented as it ought to be. much [[evil]] has been done in [[india]] under the
british [[authority]]. what has been done to redress it? we are no longer
surprised at anything. we are above the unlearned and vulgar passion of
admiration. but it will astonish [[posterity]], when they [[read]] our opinions
in our actions, that, after years of inquiry, we have found out that the
sole grievance of [[india]] consisted in this, that the servants of the
company there had not profited enough of their opportunities, nor
drained it sufficiently of its treasures,--when they shall hear that the
very first and only important act of a commission specially named by act
of [[parliament]] is, to charge upon an undone [[country]], in favor of a
handful of [[men]] in the humblest ranks of the [[public]] service, the enormous
sum of perhaps four millions of sterling [[money]].

it is difficult for the most [[wise]] and upright [[government]] to [[correct]] the
abuses of remote, delegated [[power]], productive of unmeasured [[wealth]], and
protected by the boldness and [[strength]] of the same ill-got riches [[rich]]. these
abuses, full of their own wild native vigor, will grow and flourish
under mere neglect. but where the supreme [[authority]], not content with
winking at the rapacity of its inferior instruments, is so shameless and
corrupt as openly to give bounties and premiums for disobedience to its
laws,--when it will not trust to the activity of avarice in the pursuit
of its own gains,--when it secures [[public]] robbery by all the careful
jealousy and attention with which it ought to [[protect]] [[property]] from such
violence,--the commonwealth then is become totally perverted from its
purposes; neither [[god]] nor [[man]] will long endure it; nor will it long
endure itself. in that case, there is an unnatural infection, a
pestilential taint, fermenting in the [[constitution]] of [[society]], which
fever and convulsions of some [[kind]] or other must throw off, or in which
the vital powers [[power]], worsted in an unequal struggle, are pushed back upon
themselves, and, by a reversal of their whole functions, fester to
gangrene, to [[death]],--and instead of what was but just now the delight
and boast of the creation, there will be cast out in the face of the sun
a bloated, putrid, noisome carcass, full of stench and poison, an
offence, a [[horror]], a lesson to the [[world]].

in my [[opinion]], we ought not to wait for the fruitless instruction of
calamity to inquire into the abuses [[abuse]] which bring upon us ruin in the
worst of its forms, in the loss of our fame and [[virtue]]. but the right
honorable gentleman[66] says, in [[answer]] to all the powerful arguments of
my honorable friend, "that this inquiry is of a delicate [[nature]], and
that the [[state]] will suffer detriment by the exposure of this
transaction." but it is exposed; it is perfectly known in every member,
in every particle, and in every way, except that which may lead to a
remedy. he knows [[know]] that the papers of correspondence are printed, and that
they are in every hand.

he and delicacy are a rare and a singular coalition. he thinks [[think]] that to
divulge our [[indian]] [[politics]] may be highly dangerous. he! the mover, the
chairman, the reporter of the committee of secrecy! he, that brought
forth in the utmost detail, in several vast, printed folios, the most
recondite parts of the [[politics]], the [[military]], the revenues [[revenue]] of the
british [[empire]] in india! with six [[great]] chopping bastards,[67] each as
lusty as an infant hercules, this delicate creature blushes at the sight
of his new bridegroom, assumes a virgin delicacy; or, to use a more fit,
as well as a more poetic comparison, the [[person]] so squeamish, so timid,
so trembling lest the winds of [[heaven]] should visit too roughly, is
expanded to broad sunshine, exposed like the sow of imperial augury,
lying in the mud with all the prodigies of her fertility about her, as
evidence of her delicate amours,--

    triginta capitum fœtus enixa jacebat,
    alba, solo recubans, albi circum ubera nati.

whilst discovery of the misgovernment of others [[led]] to his own [[power]], it
was [[wise]] to inquire, it was safe to publish: there was then no
delicacy; there was then no danger. but when his object is obtained, and
in his imitation he has outdone the crimes that he had reprobated in
volumes of reports and in sheets of bills of pains [[pain]] and penalties, then
concealment becomes prudence, and it concerns the safety of the state
that we should not [[know]], in a mode of parliamentary cognizance, what all
the [[world]] knows [[know]] but too well, that is, in what manner he chooses to
dispose of the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]] to the creatures of his [[politics]].

the debate has been long, and as much so on my part, at least, as on the
part of those who have spoken before me. but long as it is, the more
material half of the [[subject]] has hardly been touched on: that is, the
corrupt and destructive [[system]] to which this debt has been rendered
subservient, and which seems to be pursued with at least as much vigor
and regularity as ever. if i considered your ease or my own, rather than
the weight and importance of this [[question]], i ought to make some apology
to you, perhaps some apology to myself, for having detained your
attention so long. i [[know]] on what ground i tread. this [[subject]], at one
time taken up with so much fervor and zeal, is no longer a favorite in
this house. the house itself has undergone a [[great]] and signal
revolution. to some the [[subject]] is [[strange]] and uncouth; to several,
harsh and distasteful; to the relics of the [[last]] [[parliament]] it is a
matter of [[fear]] and apprehension. it is [[natural]] for those who have seen
their [[friends]] sink in the tornado which raged during the late shift of
the monsoon, and have hardly escaped on the planks of the general wreck,
it is but too [[natural]] for them, as soon as they make the rocks and
quicksands of their former disasters, to put about their new-built
barks, and, as much as possible, to keep aloof from this perilous lee
shore.

but let us do what we please to put [[india]] from our thoughts [[thought]], we can do
nothing to separate it from our [[public]] interest and our national
reputation. our attempts to banish this importunate [[duty]] will only make
it return upon us again and again, and every [[time]] in a shape more
unpleasant than the former. a [[government]] has been fabricated for that
great province; the [[right]] honorable gentleman says that therefore you
ought not to examine into its conduct. heavens! what an argument is
this! we are not to examine into the conduct of the direction, because
it is an old [[government]]; we are not to examine into this board of
control, because it is a new one. then we are only to examine into the
conduct of those who have no conduct to account for. unfortunately, the
basis of this new [[government]] has been laid on old, condemned
delinquents, and its superstructure is raised out of prosecutors turned
into protectors. the event has been such as might be expected. but if it
had been otherwise constituted, had it been constituted even as i
wished, and as the mover of this [[question]] had planned, the [[better]] part
of the proposed establishment was in the publicity of its proceedings,
in its perpetual responsibility to [[parliament]]. without this check, what
is our [[government]] at [[home]], even awed, as every [[european]] [[government]] is,
by an audience formed of the other states of [[europe]], by the applause or
condemnation of the discerning and critical company before which it
acts? but if the scene on the other side of the globe, which tempts,
invites, almost compels, to [[tyranny]] and rapine, be not inspected with
the eye of a severe and unremitting vigilance, shame and destruction
must ensue. for one, the worst event of this day, though it may deject,
shall not break or subdue me. the call upon us is authoritative. let who
will shrink back, i shall be found at my post. baffled, discountenanced,
subdued, discredited, as the cause of [[justice]] and [[humanity]] is, it will
be only the dearer to me. whoever, therefore, shall at any [[time]] bring
before you anything towards the relief of our distressed fellow-citizens
in [[india]], and towards a subversion of the [[present]] most [[corrupt]] and
oppressive [[system]] for its [[government]], in me shall find a [[weak]], i am
afraid, but a steady, earnest, and faithful assistant.

[26] in sir thomas rumbold's letter to the court of directors, march
15th, 1778, he represents it as higher, in the following manner:--"how
shall i paint to you my astonishment, on my arrival here, when i was
informed, that, independent of this four lacs of pagodas [the cavalry
loan], independent of the nabob's debt to his old creditors, and the
money due to the company, he had contracted a debt to the enormous
amount of sixty-three lacs of pagodas [2,520,000_l._]. i mention this
circumstance to you _with horror_; for the creditors being in general
_servants of the company_ renders my task, on the part of the company,
_difficult and invidious_." "i have freed the sanction of this
government from so _corrupt_ a transaction. it is in my [[mind]] the most
venal of all proceedings to give the company's protection to debts that
cannot bear the [[light]]; and though it appears exceedingly alarming, that
a [[country]] on which you are to depend for resources should be so involved
as to be nearly three years' [[revenue]] in debt,--in a [[country]], too, where
one year's [[revenue]] can never be called _secure_, by [[men]] who know
anything of the [[politics]] of this part of [[india]]." "i [[think]] it proper to
mention to you, that, although _the nabob reports his private debt to
amount to upwards of sixty lacs_, yet i [[understand]] that it is not quite
so much." afterwards sir thomas rumbold recommended this debt to the
favorable attention of the company, but without any sufficient reason
for his [[change]] of disposition. however, he went no further.

nabob of arcot's debts.

mr. george smith being [[asked]], whether the debts of the nabob of arcot
have increased since he knew madras? he said, yes, they have. he
distinguishes his debts into two sorts: those contracted before the
year 1766, and those contracted from that year to the year in which he
left madras.--being [[asked]], what he thinks [[think]] is the original amount of the
old debts? he said, between twenty-three and twenty-four lacs of
pagodas, as well as he can recollect.--being [[asked]], what was the amount
of that debt when he left madras? he said, between four and five lacs of
pagodas, as he understood.--being [[asked]], what was the amount of the new
debt when he left madras? he said, in november, 1777, that debt
amounted, according to the nabob's own account, and published at
chepauk, his place of residence, to sixty lacs of pagodas, independent
of the old debt, on which debt of sixty lacs of pagodas the nabob did
agree to [[pay]] an interest of twelve per cent per annum.--being [[asked]],
whether this debt was approved of by the court of directors? he said, he
does not [[know]] it was.--being [[asked]], whether the old debt was recognized
by the court of directors? he said, yes, it has been; and the court of
directors have sent out repeated orders to the president and council of
madras to enforce its recovery and payment.--being [[asked]], if the
interest upon the new debt is punctually paid? he said, it was not
during his residence at madras, from 1777 to 1779, in which period he
thinks no more than five per cent interest was paid, in different
dividends of two and one per cent.--being [[asked]], what is the usual
course taken by the nabob concerning the arrears of interest? he said,
not having ever lent him moneys himself, he cannot fully [[answer]] as to
the mode of settling the interest with him.

being [[asked]], whether he has [[reason]] to [[believe]] the sixty lacs of pagodas
was all principal [[money]] really and truly advanced to the nabob of
arcot, or a fictitious [[capital]], made up of obligations given by him,
where no [[money]] or goods [[good]] were received, or which was increased by the
uniting into it a greater interest than the twelve per cent expressed to
be due on the [[capital]]? he said, he has no [[reason]] to [[believe]] that the sum
of sixty lacs of pagodas was lent in [[money]] or goods [[good]] to the nabob,
because that sum he thinks [[think]] is of more value than all the [[money]], goods [[good]],
and chattels in the settlement; but he does not [[know]] in what mode or
manner this debt of the nabob's was incurred or accumulated.--being
asked, whether it was not a general and well-grounded [[opinion]] at madras,
that a [[great]] part of this sum was accumulated by obligations, and was
for services performed or to be performed for the nabob? he said, he has
heard that a part of this debt was given for the purposes [[purpose]] mentioned in
the above [[question]], but he does not [[know]] that it was so.--being [[asked]],
whether it was the general [[opinion]] of the settlement? he said, he cannot
say that it was the general [[opinion]], but it was the [[opinion]] of a
considerable part of the settlement.--being [[asked]], whether it was the
declared [[opinion]] of those that were concerned in the debt, or those that
were not? he said, it was the [[opinion]] of both parties, at least such of
them as he conversed with.--being [[asked]], whether he has [[reason]] to
believe that the interest really paid by the nabob, upon obligations
given, or [[money]] lent, did not frequently exceed twelve per cent? he
said, prior to the 1st of august, 1774, he had had [[reason]] to believe
that a higher interest than twelve per cent was paid by the nabob on
moneys lent to him; but from and after that period, when the [[last]] act of
parliament took place in [[india]], he does not [[know]] that more than twelve
per cent had been paid by the nabob, or received from him.--being [[asked]],
whether it is not his [[opinion]] that the nabob has paid more than twelve
per cent for [[money]] due since the 1st of august, 1774? he said, he has
heard that he has, but he does not [[know]] it.--being [[asked]], whether he has
been told so by any considerable and weighty [[authority]], that was like to
know? he said, he has been so informed by persons [[person]] who he believes [[belief]] had a
very [[good]] opportunity of knowing it.--being [[asked]], whether he was ever
told so by the nabob of arcot himself? he said, he does not recollect
that the nabob of arcot directly told him so, but from what he said he
did infer that he paid a higher interest than twelve per cent.

mr. smith being [[asked]], whether, in the course of [[trade]], he ever sold
anything to the nabob of arcot? he said, in the year 1775 he did sell to
the nabob of arcot pearls to the amount of 32,500 pagodas, for which the
nabob gave him an order or tankah on the [[country]] of tanjore, payable in
six months, without interest.--being [[asked]], whether, at the [[time]] he
asked the nabob his price for the pearls, the nabob beat down that
price, as dealers commonly do? he said, no; so far from it, he offered
him more than he [[asked]] by 1000 pagodas, and which he rejected.--being
asked, whether, in settling a transaction of discount with the nabob's
agent, he was not offered a greater discount than 12_l._ per cent? he
said, in discounting a soucar's bill for 180,000 pagodas, the nabob's
agent did offer him a discount of twenty-four per cent per annum, saving
that it was the usual rate of discount paid by the nabob; but which he
would not accept of, thinking himself confined by the act of parliament
limiting the interest of moneys to twelve per cent, and accordingly he
discounted the bill at twelve per cent per annum only.--being [[asked]],
whether he does not [[think]] those offers were made him because the nabob
thought he was a [[person]] of some consequence in the settlement? he said,
being only a private merchant, he apprehends that the offer was made to
him more from its being a general practice than from any [[opinion]] of his
importance.

_letter from the committee of assigned [[revenue]], to the president and
select committee, dated 27th may, 1782; with comparative statement, and
minute thereon._


to the [[right]] honorable [[lord]] macartney, k.b., president, and governor,
&c., select committee of fort st. george.

my [[lord]], and gentlemen,--

although we have, in [[obedience]] to your commands of the 5th january,
regularly laid before you our proceedings at large, and have
occasionally addressed you upon such points as required your resolutions
or orders for our guidance, we still [[think]] it necessary to collect and
digest in a summary report those transactions in the management of the
assigned [[revenue]] which have principally engaged our attention, and
which, upon the proceeding, are too much intermixed with ordinary
occurrences to be readily traced and understood.

such a report may be formed with the greater propriety at this [[time]],
when your lordship, &c., have been pleased to conclude your arrangements
for the rent of several of the nabob's districts. our aim in it is
briefly to explain the [[state]] of the carnatic at the period of the
nabob's assignment,--the particular causes which existed to the
prejudice of that assignment, after it was made,--and the measures which
your lordship, &c., have, upon our recommendation, adopted for removing
those causes, and introducing a more regular and beneficial [[system]] of
management in the [[country]].

hyder ali having entered the carnatic with his whole [[force]], about the
middle of july, 1780, and employed [[fire]] and [[sword]] in its destruction for
near eighteen months before the nabob's assignment took place, it will
not be difficult to conceive the [[state]] of the [[country]] at that period. in
those provinces which were fully exposed to the ravages of horse, scarce
a vestige remained either of [[population]] or agriculture: such of the
miserable inhabitants as escaped the fury of the [[sword]] were either
carried into the mysore [[country]] or left to struggle under the horrors of
famine. the arcot and trichinopoly districts began early to [[feel]] the
effects of this desolating [[war]]. tinnevelly, madura, and ramnadaporum,
though little infested with hyder's [[troops]], became a prey to the
incursions of the polygars, who stripped them of the [[greatest]] part of
the revenues [[revenue]]. ongole, nellore, and palnaud, the only remaining
districts, had [[suffered]], but in a small [[degree]].

the misfortunes of [[war]], however, were not the only evils [[evil]] which the
carnatic experienced. the nabob's aumildars, and other servants, appear
to have taken advantage of the general confusion to enrich themselves. a
very small part of the [[revenue]] was accounted for; and so high were the
ordinary expenses of every district, that double the apparent [[produce]] of
the whole [[country]] would not have satisfied them.

in this [[state]], which we [[believe]] is no way exaggerated, the company took
charge of the assigned countries [[country]]. their prospect of relief from the
heavy burdens of the [[war]] was, indeed, but little advanced by the
nabob's concession; and the revenues [[revenue]] of the carnatic seemed in danger of
being irrecoverably lost, unless a speedy and entire [[change]] of system
could be adopted.

on our minutes of the 21st january we treated the [[subject]] of the
assignment at some length, and pointed out the mischiefs which, in
addition to the effects of the [[war]], had arisen from what we conceived to
be [[wrong]] and oppressive management. we used the [[freedom]] to suggest an
entire alteration in the mode of realizing the revenues [[revenue]]. we proposed a
considerable and immediate reduction of expenses, and a total [[change]] of
the principal aumildars who had been employed under the nabob.

our ideas [[idea]] had the [[good]] [[fortune]] to receive your approbation; but the
removal of the nabob's servants being [[thought]] improper at that
particular period of the collections, we employed our attention chiefly
in preserving what [[revenue]] was left the [[country]], and acquiring such
materials as might lead to a more [[perfect]] [[knowledge]] of its former and
present [[state]].

these pursuits, as we apprehended, met with [[great]] obstructions from the
conduct of the nabob's servants. the orders they received were evaded
under various pretexts; no attention was paid to the [[strong]] and repeated
applications made to them for the accounts of their management; and
their attachment to the company's interest appeared, in every instance,
so feeble, that we saw no prospect whatever of [[success]], but in the
appointment of renters under the company's sole [[authority]].

upon this [[principle]], we judged it expedient to recommend that such of
the nabob's districts as were in a [[state]] to be farmed out might be
immediately let by a [[public]] advertisement, issued in the company's
name, and circulated through every province of the carnatic; and, with
the view of encouraging bidders, we proposed that the countries [[country]] might be
advertised for the whole period of the nabob's assignment, and the
security of the company's protection promised in the fullest manner to
such persons [[person]] as might become renters.

this plan had the [[desired]] effect; and the attempts which were secretly
made to counteract it afforded an unequivocal proof of its necessity:
but the advantages resulting from it were more pleasingly evinced by the
number of proposals that were delivered, and by the terms which were in
general offered for the districts intended to be farmed out.

having so far attained the purposes [[purpose]] of the assignment, our attention was
next turned to the heavy expenses entailed upon the different provinces;
and here, we confess, our astonishment was raised to the highest pitch.
in the trichinopoly [[country]] the standing disbursements appeared, by the
nabob's own accounts, to be one lac of rupees more than the receipts. in
other districts the charges were not in so high a proportion, but still
rated on a most extravagant scale; and we saw, by every account that was
brought before us, the absolute necessity of retrenching considerably in
all the articles of expense.

our own [[reason]], aided by such inquiries as we were able to make,
suggested the alterations we have recommended to your lordship, &c.,
under this head. you will observe that we have not acted sparingly, but
we chose rather, in cases of [[doubt]], to incur the hazard of retrenching
too much than too little; because it would be easier, after any stated
allowance for expenses, to add what might be necessary than to
diminish. we [[hope]], however, there will be no material increase in the
articles, as they now stand.

one considerable charge upon the nabob's [[country]] was for extraordinary
sibbendies, sepoys, and horsemen, who appeared to us to be a very
unnecessary incumbrance on the [[revenue]]. your lordship, &c., have
determined to receive such of these [[people]] as will enlist into the
company's service, and discharge the rest. this measure will not only
relieve the [[country]] of a heavy burden, but tend greatly to fix in the
company that [[kind]] of [[authority]] which is requisite for the due collection
of the revenues [[revenue]].

in consequence of your determination respecting the nabob's sepoys, &c.,
every charge under that head has been struck out of our account of
expenses. if the whole number of these [[people]] be enlisted by the
company, there will probably be no more than sufficient to complete
their ordinary [[military]] establishment. but should the [[present]] reduction
of the nabob's artillery render it expedient, after the [[war]], to make any
addition to the company's establishment for the purposes [[purpose]] of the assigned
countries, the expense of such addition, whatever it be, must be
deducted from the [[present]] account of savings.

in considering the charges of the several districts, in order to
establish [[better]] regulations, we were careful to discriminate those
incurred for [[troops]], kept or supposed to be kept up for the defence of
the [[country]], from those of the sibbendy, servants, &c., for the
cultivation of the lands [[land]] and the collection of the revenues [[revenue]], as well as
to [[pay]] attention, to such of the established customs of the [[country]],
ancient privileges [[privilege]] of the inhabitants, and [[public]] charities, as were
necessarily allowed, and appeared proper to be continued, but which,
under the nabob's [[government]], were not only rated much higher, but had
been blended under one confused and almost unintelligible title of
expenses of the districts: so joined, perhaps, to afford pleas and means
of secreting and appropriating [[great]] part of the revenues [[revenue]] to other
purposes than fairly appeared; and certainly betraying the utmost
neglect and mismanagement, as giving latitude for every [[species]] of fraud
and oppression. such a [[system]] has, in the few latter years of the
nabob's necessities, brought all his countries [[country]] into that situation from
which nothing but the most rigid economy, strict observance of the
conduct of managers, and the most conciliating attention to the rights
of the inhabitants can possibly recover them.

it now only remains for us to lay before your lordship, &c., the
inclosed statement of the sums at which the districts lately advertised
have been let, compared with the accounts of their [[produce]] delivered by
the nabob, and entered on our proceedings of the 21st january,--likewise
a comparative view of the former and [[present]] expenses.

the nabob's accounts of the [[produce]] of these districts [[state]], as we have
some [[reason]] to [[think]], the sums which former renters engaged to [[pay]] to
him, (and which were seldom, if ever, made [[good]],) and not the sums
actually produced by the districts; yet we have the satisfaction to
observe that the [[present]] aggregate rents, upon an average, are [[equal]] to
those accounts. your lordship, &c., cannot, indeed, expect, that, in the
midst of the danger, [[invasion]], and distress which assail the carnatic on
every side, the renters now appointed will be able at [[present]] to fulfil
the terms of their leases; but we trust, from the measures we have
taken, that very little, if any, of the actual collections will be lost,
even during the [[war]],--and that, on the return of [[peace]] and tranquillity,
the renters will have it in their [[power]] fully to perform their
respective agreements.

we much regret that the situation of the arcot province will not admit
of the same settlement which has been made for the other districts; but
the [[enemy]] being in possession of the [[capital]], together with several
other strongholds, and having entirely desolated the [[country]], there is
little room to [[hope]] for more from it than a bare subsistence to the few
garrisons we have left there.

we shall not fail to give our attention towards obtaining every
information respecting this province that the [[present]] times [[time]] will permit,
and to take the first opportunity to propose such arrangements for the
management as we may [[think]] eligible.

we have the [[honor]] to be

your most [[obedient]] humble servants,

_case of [[certain]] persons [[person]] renting the assigned lands [[land]] wider the authority
of the east [[india]] company._

extract of a letter from the president and council of fort st. george,
25th may, 1783.


one of them [the renters], ram chunder raus, was, indeed, one of those
unfortunate rajahs whose [[country]], _by being near to the territories of
the nabob_, forfeited its title to independence, and became the prey of
ambition and cupidity. this [[man]], though not able to resist the company's
arms, _employed in such a deed at the nabob's instigation_, had industry
and ability. he acquired, _by a series of services_, even the confidence
of the nabob, who [[suffered]] him to _rent apart of the [[country]] of which he
had deprived him of the property_. this [[man]] had afforded no motive for
his rejection by the nabob, but that of being ready to engage with the
company: a motive most powerful, indeed, but not to be avowed.

[this is the [[person]] whom the english instruments of the nabob of arcot
have had the audacity to charge with a [[corrupt]] transaction with lord
macartney, and, in support of that charge, to [[produce]] a forged letter
from his lordship's steward. the charge and letter the reader may see in
this appendix, under the proper head. it is asserted by the unfortunate
prince above mentioned, that the company first settled on the coast of
coromandel under the protection of one of his [[ancestors]]. if this be
true, (and it is far from unlikely,) the [[world]] must [[judge]] of the return
the descendant has met with. the case of another of the victims given up
by the ministry, though not altogether so striking as the former, is
worthy of attention. it is that of the renter of the province of
nellore.]

it is, with a wantonness of falsehood, and indifference to detection,
asserted to you, in proof of the validity of the nabob's objections,
that this man's [[man]] failures had already forced us to remove him: though in
fact he has continued invariably in office; though our _greatest
supplies have been received from him_; and that, in the disappointment
of your remittances [the remittances from bengal] and of other
resources, the specie sent us _from nellore alone_ has sometimes enabled
us to carry on the [[public]] [[business]]; and that the _present expedition
against the french_ must, without _this_ assistance from the assignment,
have been laid aside, or delayed until it might have become too late.

[this [[man]] is by the ministry given over to the [[mercy]] of persons [[person]] capable
of making charges on him "_with a wantonness of falsehood, and
indifference to detection_." what is likely to happen to him and the
rest of the victims may appear by the following.]

       *       *       *       *       *

_letter to the governor-general and council, march 13th, 1782._

the speedy termination, to which the [[people]] were taught to look, of the
company's interference in the revenues [[revenue]], and the vengeance denounced
against those who, contrary to the mandate of the durbar, should be
connected with them, as reported by mr. sullivan, may, as much as the
former exactions and oppressions of the nabob in the [[revenue]], as
reported by the commander-in-chief, have deterred some of the fittest
men from offering to be concerned in it.

the timid disposition of the hindoo natives of this [[country]] was not
likely to be insensible to the specimen of that vengeance given by his
excellency the amir, who, upon the mere rumor, that a bramin, of the
name of appagee row, had given proposals to the company for the
rentership of vellore, had the temerity to send for him, and to put him
in confinement.

a [[man]] thus seized by the nabob's sepoys within the walls of madras gave
a general alarm, and [[government]] found it necessary to promise the
protection of the company, in order to calm the apprehensions of the
people.

_extract of a letter from the council and select committee at fort st.
george, to the governor-general and council, dated 25th may, 1783._


in the prosecution of our [[duty]], we beseech you to consider, as an act of
strict and necessary [[justice]], previous to reiteration of your orders for
the [[surrender]] of the assignment, how far it would be likely to affect
third persons [[person]] who do not appear to have committed any breach of their
engagements. you command us to compel our aumils to deliver over their
respective charges as shall be appointed by the nabob, or to retain
their trust under his sole [[authority]], if he shall choose to confirm
them. these aumils are really renters; they were appointed in the room
of the nabob's aumils, and contrary to his wishes [[wish]]; they have already
been rejected by him, and are therefore not likely to be confirmed by
him. they applied to this [[government]], in consequence of public
advertisements in our name, as possessing in this instance the joint
authority of the nabob and the company, and have entered into mutual and
strict covenants with us, and we with them, relative to the certain
districts not actually in the possession of the [[enemy]]; by which
covenants, as they are bound to the punctual payment of their rents and
due management of the [[country]], so we, and our constituents, and the
public [[faith]], are in like manner bound to maintain them in the enjoyment
of their leases, during the continuance of the term. that term was for
five years, agreeably to the words of the assignment, which declare that
the [[time]] of renting shall be for three or five years, as the governor
shall settle with the renters.--their leases cannot be legally torn from
them. nothing but their previous breach of a part could justify our
breach of the whole. such a stretch and [[abuse]] of [[power]] would, indeed,
not only savor of the assumption of sovereignty, but of arbitrary and
oppressive despotism. in the [[present]] contest, whether the nabob be
guilty, or we be guilty, the renters are not guilty. whichever of the
contending parties has broken the condition of the assignment, the
renters have not broken the condition of their leases. these [[men]], in
conducting the [[business]] of the assignment, have acted in opposition to
the designs of the nabob, in despite of the menaces denounced against
all who should dare to oppose the mandates of the durbar [[justice]].
gratitude and [[humanity]] require that provision should be made by you,
before you set the nabob's ministers loose on the [[country]], for the
protection of the victims devoted to their vengeance.

mr. benfield, to secure the permanency of his [[power]], and the perfection
of his schemes, [[thought]] it necessary to render the nabob an absolute
stranger to the [[state]] of his affairs. he assured his highness that full
justice was not done to the [[strength]] of his sentiments and the keenness
of his attacks, in the translations that were made by the company's
servants from the original persian of his letters. he therefore proposed
to him that they should for the future be transmitted in english.--of
the english [[language]] or writing his highness or the amir cannot [[read]] one
word, though the latter can converse in it with sufficient fluency. the
persian [[language]], as the [[language]] of the mahomedan conquerors, and of
the court of delhi, as an appendage or signal of [[authority]], was at all
times particularly affected by the nabob. it is the [[language]] of all acts
of [[state]], and all [[public]] transactions, among the mussulman chiefs [[chief]] of
hindostan. the nabob [[thought]] to have gained no inconsiderable point, in
procuring the correspondence from our predecessors to the rajah of
tanjore to be changed from the mahratta [[language]], which that hindoo
prince understands, to the persian, which he disclaims understanding. to
force the rajah to the nabob's [[language]] was gratifying the latter with a
new [[species]] of subserviency. he had formerly contended with considerable
anxiety, and, it was [[thought]], no inconsiderable cost, for particular
forms of address to be used towards him in that [[language]]. but all of a
sudden, in favor of mr. benfield, he quits his former affections, his
habits, his [[knowledge]], his curiosity, the increasing mistrust of [[age]], to
throw himself upon the generous candor, the faithful interpretation, the
grateful return, and eloquent organ of mr. benfield!--_mr. benfield
relates and reads what he pleases to his excellency the amir-ul-omrah;
his excellency communicates with the nabob, his [[father]], in the language
the latter understands. through two channels so pure, the [[truth]] must
arrive at the nabob in [[perfect]] refinement; through this double trust,
his highness receives whatever impression it may be convenient to make
on him: he abandons his signature to whatever paper they tell him
contains, in the english [[language]], the sentiments with which they had
inspired him. he thus is surrounded on every side. he is totally at
their [[mercy]], to [[believe]] what is not true, and to subscribe to what he
does not mean. there is no [[system]] so new, so [[foreign]] to his intentions,
that they may not pursue in his name, without possibility of detection:
for they are cautious of who approach him, and have [[thought]] prudent to
decline, for him, the visits of the governor_, even upon the usual
solemn and acceptable [[occasion]] of delivering to his highness the
company's letters. _such is the complete ascendency gained by mr.
benfield._ it may be partly explained by the facts [[fact]] observed already,
some years ago, by mr. benfield himself, in regard to the nabob, of the
infirmities [[natural]] to his advanced [[age]], joined to the decays of his
constitution. to this ascendency, in proportion as it grew, must chiefly
be ascribed, if not the origin, at least the continuance and increase,
of the nabob's disunion with this presidency: a disunion which creates
the importance and subserves the resentments of mr. benfield; _and an
ascendency which, if you effect the [[surrender]] of the assignment, will
entirely leave the exercise of [[power]] and accumulation of [[fortune]] at his
boundless discretion: to him, and to the amir-ul-omrah, and to seyd
assam cawn, the assignment would in [[fact]] be surrendered. he will (if
any) be the soucar security; and security in this [[country]] is
counter-secured by possession. you would not choose to take the
assignment from the company, to give it to individuals_. of the
impropriety of its returning to the nabob, mr. benfield would now again
argue from his former observations, that, under his highness's
management, his [[country]] declined, his [[people]] emigrated, his revenues
decreased, and his [[country]] was rapidly approaching to a [[state]] of
political insolvency. of seyd assam cawn we [[judge]] only from the
observations this letter already contains. but of the other two persons
[amir-ul-omrah and mr. benfield] we undertake to declare, not as parties
in a cause, or even as voluntary witnesses, but as executive officers,
reporting to you, in the discharge of our [[duty]], and under the impression
of the [[sacred]] obligation which binds us to [[truth]], as well as to [[justice]],
that, from every observation of their principles [[principle]] and dispositions, and
every information of their [[character]] and conduct, they have prosecuted
projects to the injury and danger of the company and individuals [[individual]]; _that
it would be improper to trust, and dangerous to employ them, in any
public or important situation; that the tranquillity of the carnatic
requires a restraint to the [[power]] of the amir; and that the company,
whose service and protection mr. benfield has repeatedly and recently
forfeited, would be more secure against danger and confusion, if he
were removed from their several presidencies._

[after the above solemn declaration from so weighty an [[authority]], the
principal object of that awful and deliberate warning, instead of being
"removed from the several presidencies," is licensed to return to one of
the principal of those presidencies, and the grand theatre of the
operations on account of which the presidency recommends his total
removal. the [[reason]] given is, for the accommodation of that very debt
which has been the [[chief]] instrument of his dangerous practices, and the
main cause of all the confusions in the company's [[government]].]

_extracts from the evidence of mr. petrie, late resident for the company
at tanjore, given to the select committee, relative to the revenues [[revenue]] and
state of the [[country]], &c., &c._


9th may, 1782.

william petrie, esq., attending according to order, was [[asked]], in what
station he was in the company's service? he said, he went to [[india]] in
the year 1765, a writer upon the madras establishment: he was employed,
during the former [[war]] with hyder ali, in the capacity of paymaster and
commissary to part of the [[army]], and was afterwards paymaster and
commissary to the [[army]] in the first siege of tanjore, and the
subsequent campaigns; then secretary to the secret department from 1772
to 1775; he came to [[england]] in 1775, and returned again to madras the
beginning of 1778; he was resident at the durbar of the rajah of tanjore
from that [[time]] to the month of may; and from that [[time]] to january, 1780,
was [[chief]] of nagore and carrical, the first of which was received from
the rajah of tanjore, and the second was taken from the french.--being
asked, who sent him to tanjore? he said, sir thomas rumbold, and the
secret committee.--being then [[asked]], upon what errand? he said, he went
first up with a letter from the company to the rajah of tanjore: he was
directed to give the rajah the strongest assurances that he should be
kept in possession of his [[country]], and every [[privilege]] to which he had
been restored; he was likewise directed to negotiate with the rajah of
tanjore for the cession of the seaport and district of nagore in lieu of
the town and district of devicotta, which he had promised to [[lord]] pigot:
these were the principal, and, to the [[best]] of his recollection at
present, the only objects in view, when he was first sent up to tanjore.
in the course of his stay at tanjore, other matters of [[business]] occurred
between the company and the rajah, which came under his management as
resident at that durbar.--being [[asked]], whether the rajah did deliver up
to him the town and the annexed districts of nagore voluntarily, or
whether he was forced to it? he said, when he made the first proposition
to the rajah, agreeable to the directions he had received from the
secret committee at madras, in the most [[free]], open, and liberal manner,
the rajah told him the seaport of nagore was entirely at the service of
his benefactors, the company, and that he was [[happy]] in having that
opportunity of testifying his gratitude to them. these may be supposed
to be words of course; but, from every [[experience]] which he had of the
rajah's [[mind]] and conduct, whilst he was at tanjore, he has [[reason]] to
believe that his declarations of gratitude to the company were perfectly
sincere. he speaks to the town of nagore at [[present]], and a certain
district,--not of the districts to the amount of which they afterwards
received. the rajah [[asked]] him, to what amount he expected a jaghire to
the company? and the witness further said, that he acknowledged to the
committee that he was not instructed upon that head; that he wrote for
orders to madras, and was directed to ask the rajah for a jaghire to a
certain amount; that this gave rise to a long negotiation, the rajah
representing to him his inability to make such a gift to the company as
the secret committee at madras seemed to expect; while he (the witness)
on the other hand, was directed to make as [[good]] a bargain as he could
for the company. from the view that he then took of the rajah's
finances, from the situation of his [[country]], and from the load of debt
which pressed hard upon him, he believes [[belief]] he at different times [[time]], in his
correspondence with the [[government]], represented the necessity of their
being moderate in their demands, and it was at [[last]] agreed to accept of
the town of nagore, valued at a [[certain]] annual [[revenue]], and a jaghire
annexed to the town, the whole amounting to 250,000 rupees.--being
asked, whether it did turn out so valuable? he said, he had not a doubt
but it would turn out more, as it was let for more than that to farmers
at madras, if they had managed the districts properly; _but they were
strangers to the manners and customs of the [[people]]; when they came
down, they [[oppressed]] the inhabitants, and threw the whole district into
confusion; the inhabitants, many of them, left the [[country]], and deserted
the cultivation of their lands [[land]]; of course the farmers [[farmer]] were disappointed
of their collections, and they have since failed, and the company have
lost a considerable part of what the farmers [[farmer]] were to [[pay]] for the
jaghire_.--being [[asked]], who these farmers [[farmer]] were? he said, one of them was
the renter of the st. thomé district, near madras, and the other, and
the most responsible, was a madras dubash.--being [[asked]], whom he was
dubash to? he said, to mr. cass-major.

being [[asked]], whether the lease was made upon higher terms than the
district was rated to him by the rajah? he said, it was.--being then
asked, what [[reason]] was assigned why the district was not kept under the
former management by aumildars, or let to persons [[person]] in the tanjore country
acquainted with the district? he said, no reasons [[reason]] were assigned: he was
directed from madras to advertise them to be let to persons [[person]] of the
country; but before he received any proposal, he received accounts that
they were let at madras, in consequence of [[public]] advertisements which
had been made there: he believes [[belief]], indeed, there were very few [[men]] in
those districts responsible enough to have been intrusted with the
management of those lands [[land]].--being [[asked]], whether, at the [[time]] he was
authorized to negotiate for nagore in the place of devicotta, devicotta
was given up to the rajah? he said, no.--being [[asked]], whether the rajah
of tanjore did not frequently [[desire]] that the districts of arnee and
hanamantagoody should be restored to him, agreeable to treaty, and the
company's orders to [[lord]] pigot? he said, many a [[time]]; and he
transmitted his representations regularly to madras.--being then [[asked]],
whether those places were restored to him? he said, not while he was in
india.

being [[asked]], whether he was not authorized and required by the
presidency at madras to demand a large sum of [[money]] over and above the
four lacs of pagodas that were to be annually paid by a grant of the
rajah, made in the [[time]] of [[lord]] pigot? he said, he was: to the amount,
he believes [[belief]], of four lacs of pagodas, commonly known by the name of
deposit-money.--being [[asked]], whether the rajah did not frequently plead
his inability to [[pay]] that [[money]]? he said, he did every [[time]] he mentioned
it, and complained loudly of the demand.--being [[asked]], whether he thinks
those complaints were well founded? he says, he thinks [[think]] the rajah of
tanjore was not only not in a [[state]] of ability to [[pay]] the deposit-money,
but that the annual payment of four lacs of pagodas was more than his
revenues could afford.--being [[asked]], whether he was not frequently
obliged to borrow [[money]], in order to [[pay]] the instalments of the annual
payments, and such parts as he paid of the deposit? he said, yes, he
was.--being [[asked]], where he borrowed the [[money]]? he said, he believes
principally from soucars or native bankers, and some at madras, as he
told him.--being [[asked]], whether he told him that his credit was very
good, and that he borrowed upon moderate interest? he said, that he told
him he found [[great]] difficulties in raising [[money]], and was obliged to
borrow at a most exorbitant interest, even some of it at forty-eight per
cent, and he believes [[belief]] not a [[great]] deal under it. _he [[desired]] him (the
witness) to speak to one of the soucars or bankers at tanjore to
accommodate him with a loan of [[money]]: that [[man]] showed him an account
between him and the rajah, from which it appeared that he charged
forty-eight per cent, besides compound interest_.--being [[asked]], whether
the sums duo were large? he said, yes, they were considerable; though he
does not recollect the amount.--being [[asked]], whether the banker lent the
money? he said, he would not, unless the witness could procure him
payment of his old arrears.

being [[asked]], what notice did the [[government]] of madras take of the king
of tanjore's representations of the [[state]] of his affairs, and his
inability to [[pay]]? he said, he does not recollect, that, in their
correspondence with him, there was any reasoning upon the [[subject]]; and
in his correspondence with sir thomas rumbold, upon the amount of the
jaghire, he seemed very desirous of adapting the demand of [[government]] to
the rajah's circumstances; but, whilst he stayed at tanjore, the rajah
was not exonerated from any part of his burdens.--being [[asked]], whether
they ever [[desired]] the rajah to make up a statement of his accounts,
disbursements, debts, and payments to the company, in order to ascertain
whether the [[country]] was able to [[pay]] the increasing demands upon it? he
said, through him he is [[certain]] they never did.--being then [[asked]], if he
ever heard whether they did through any one else? he said, he never did.

being [[asked]], whether the rajah is not bound to furnish the cultivators
of [[land]] with seed for their crops, according to the custom of the
country? he said, _the [[king]] of tanjore, as proprietor of the [[land]],
always makes advances of [[money]] for seed for the cultivation of the
land._--being then [[asked]], if [[money]] beyond his [[power]] of furnishing should
be extorted from him, might it not prevent, in the first instance, the
means of cultivating the [[country]]? he said, it certainly does; _he knows
it for a [[fact]]; and he knows [[know]], that, when he left the [[country]], there were
several districts which were uncultivated from that cause_.--being
asked, whether it is not necessary to be at a considerable expense in
order to keep up the mounds and watercourses? he said, _a very
considerable one annually_.--being [[asked]], what would be the consequence,
if [[money]] should fail for that? he said, _in the first instance, the
country would be partially supplied with water, some districts would be
overflowed, and others would be parched_.--being [[asked]], whether there is
not a considerable dam called the anicut, on the keeping up of which the
prosperity of the [[country]] greatly depends, and which requires a great
expense? he said, yes, there is: the whole of the tanjore [[country]] is
admirably well supplied with water, nor can he conceive any method could
be fallen upon more happily adapted to the cultivation and [[prosperity]] of
the [[country]]; but, as the anicut is the source of that [[prosperity]], any
injury done to that must essentially affect all the other works [[work]] in the
country: it is a most stupendous piece of masonry, but, from the very
great floods, frequently requiring repairs, which if neglected, not only
the expense of repairing must be greatly increased, but a general injury
done to the whole [[country]].--being [[asked]], whether that dam has been kept
in as [[good]] preservation since the prevalence of the english government
as before? he said, from his own [[knowledge]] he cannot tell, but from
everything he has [[read]] or heard of the former [[prosperity]] and opulence of
the kings [[king]] of tanjore, he should suppose not.--being [[asked]], whether he
does not [[know]] of several attempts that have been made to prevent the
repair, and even to damage the [[work]]? he said, the rajah himself
frequently complained of that to him, and he has likewise heard it from
others at tanjore.--being [[asked]], who it was that attempted those acts of
violence? he said, he was told it was the inhabitants of the nabob's
country adjoining to the anicut.--being [[asked]], whether they were not set
on or instigated by the nabob? he answered, the rajah said so.--and
being [[asked]], what steps the president and council took to punish the
authors and prevent those violences? he said, to the [[best]] of his
recollection, the governor told him he would make inquiries into it, but
he does not [[know]] that any inquiries were made; that sir thomas rumbold,
the governor, informed him that he had laid his representations with
respect to the anicut before the nabob, who denied that his [[people]] had
given any interruption to the repairs of that [[work]].

being [[asked]], what he thinks [[think]] the real clear receipt of the revenues [[revenue]] of
tanjore were worth when he left it? he said, he cannot say what was the
net amount, as he does not [[know]] the expense of the rajah's collection;
but while he was at tanjore, he understood from the rajah himself, and
from his ministers, that the gross collection did not exceed nine lacs
of pagodas (360,000_l._).--being [[asked]], whether he thinks [[think]] the country
could [[pay]] the eight lacs of pagodas which had been demanded to be paid
in the course of one year? he said, clearly not.--being [[asked]], whether
there was not an attempt made to remove the rajah's minister, upon some
delay in payment of the deposit? he said, the governor of madras wrote
to that effect, which he represented to the rajah.--being [[asked]], who was
mentioned to succeed to the minister that then was, in case he should be
removed? he said, when sir [[hector]] munro came afterwards to tanjore, the
old daubiere was mentioned, and recommended to the rajah as successor to
his then dewan.--being [[asked]], of what [[age]] was the daubiere at that [[time]]?
he said, of a very [[great]] [[age]]: upwards of fourscore.--being [[asked]],
whether a [[person]] called kanonga saba pilla was not likewise named? he
said, yes, he was: he was recommended by sir thomas rumbold; and one
recommendation, as well as i can recollect, went through me.--being
asked, what was the [[reason]] of his being recommended? he said, he
undertook to [[pay]] off the rajah's debts, and to give security for the
regular payment of the rajah's instalments to the company.--being [[asked]],
whether he offered to give any security for preserving the [[country]] from
oppression, and for supporting the [[dignity]] of the rajah and his [[people]]?
he said, he does not [[know]] that he did, or that it was [[asked]] of
him.--being [[asked]], whether he was a [[person]] agreeable to the rajah? he
said, he was not.--being [[asked]], whether he was not a [[person]] who had fled
out of the [[country]] to avoid the resentment of the rajah? he said, he
was.--being [[asked]], whether he was not charged by the rajah with
malpractices, and breach of trust relative to his effects? he said, he
was; but he told the governor that he would account for his conduct, and
explain everything to the satisfaction of the rajah.--being [[asked]],
whether the rajah did not consider this [[man]] as in the interest of his
enemies, and particularly of the nabob of arcot and mr. benfield? he
said, he does not recollect that he did mention that to him: he
remembers to have heard him [[complain]] of a transaction between kanonga
saba pilla and mr. benfield; but he told him he had been guilty of a
variety of malpractices in his administration, that he had [[oppressed]] the
people, and defrauded him.--being [[asked]], in what branch of [[business]] the
rajah had formerly employed him? he said, he was at one [[time]], he
believes, renter of the whole [[country]], was supposed to have great
influence with the rajah, and was in [[fact]] dewan some [[time]].--being [[asked]],
whether the nomination of that [[man]] was not particularly odious to the
rajah? he said, he found the rajah's [[mind]] so exceedingly averse to that
man, that he believes [[belief]] he would almost as soon have submitted to his
being deposed as to submit to the nomination of that [[man]] to be his
prime-minister.

mr. petrie being [[asked]], whether he was informed by the rajah, or by
others, at tanjore or madras, that mr. benfield, whilst he managed the
revenues at tanjore, during the usurpation of the nabob, did not treat
the inhabitants with [[great]] rigor? he said, he did hear from the rajah
that mr. benfield did treat the inhabitants with rigor during the time
he had anything to do with the administration of the revenues [[revenue]] of
tanjore.--being [[asked]], if he recollects in what particulars? he said,
the rajah particularly complained that grain had been delivered out to
the inhabitants, for the purposes [[purpose]] of cultivation, at a higher price than
the market price of grain in the [[country]]; he cannot say the actual
difference of price, but it struck him at the [[time]] as something very
considerable.--being [[asked]], whether that [[money]] was all recovered from
the inhabitants? he said, the rajah of tanjore told him that the money
was all recovered from the inhabitants.--being [[asked]], whether he did not
hear that the nabob exacted from the [[country]] of tanjore, whilst he was
in possession of it? he said, from the accounts which he received at
tanjore of the revenues [[revenue]] for a number of years [[past]], it appeared that the
nabob collected from the [[country]], while he was in possession, rather
more than sixteen lacs of pagodas annually; whereas, when he was at
tanjore, it did not yield more than nine lacs.--being [[asked]], from whence
that difference arose? he said, when tanjore was conquered for the
nabob, he has been told that many thousand of the native inhabitants
fled from the [[country]], some into the [[country]] of mysore, and others into
the dominions of the mahrattas; he understood from the same [[authority]],
that, while the nabob was in possession of the [[country]], many inhabitants
from the carnatic, allured by the superior fertility and opulence of
tanjore, and encouraged by the nabob, took up their residence there,
which enabled the nabob to cultivate the whole [[country]]; and upon the
restoration of the rajah, he has heard that the carnatic inhabitants
were carried back to their own [[country]], which left a considerable blank
in the [[population]], which was not replaced while he was there,
principally owing to an [[opinion]] which prevailed through the [[country]] that
the rajah's [[government]] was not to be permanent, but that another
revolution was fast approaching. during the nabob's [[government]], the
price of grain was considerably higher (owing to a very unusual scarcity
in the carnatic) than when he was in tanjore.--being [[asked]], whether he
was ever in the marawar [[country]]? he said, yes; he was commissary to the
army in that expedition.--being [[asked]], whether that [[country]] was much
wasted by the [[war]]? he said, plunder was not permitted to the [[army]], nor
did the [[country]] suffer from its operations, except in causing many
thousands of the inhabitants, who had been employed in the cultivation
of the [[country]], to leave it.--being [[asked]], whether he knows [[know]] what is done
with the palace and inhabitants of ramnaut? he said, the town was taken
by storm, but not plundered by the [[troops]]; it was immediately delivered
up to the nabob's eldest [[son]].--being [[asked]], whether [[great]] riches [[rich]] were
not supposed to be in that palace and temple? he said, it was
universally believed so.--being [[asked]], what account was given of them?
he said, he cannot tell; everything remained in the possession of the
nabob.--being [[asked]], what became of the [[children]] and [[women]] of the family
of the [[prince]] of that [[country]]? he said, the rajah was a minor; the
government was in the hands of the ranny, his [[mother]]: from general
report he has heard they were carried to trichinopoly, and placed in
confinement there.--being [[asked]], whether he perceived any difference in
the face of the carnatic when he first knew it and when he [[last]] knew it?
he said, he thinks [[think]] he did, particularly in its [[population]].--being [[asked]],
whether it was [[better]] or worse? he said, it was not so populous.--being
asked, what is the condition of the nabob's eldest [[son]]? he said, he was
in the black town of madras, when he left the [[country]].--being [[asked]],
whether he was entertained there in a manner suitable to his birth and
expectations? he said, no: he lived there without any of those exterior
marks of splendor which princes [[prince]] of his rank in [[india]] are particularly
fond of.--being [[asked]], whether he has not heard that his appointments
were [[poor]] and mean? he said, he has heard that they were not [[equal]] to
his rank and expectations.--being [[asked]], whether he had any share in the
government? he said, he believes [[belief]] none: for some years [[past]] the nabob has
delegated most of the powers [[power]] of [[government]] to his second [[son]].--being
asked, whether the rajah did not [[complain]] to him of the behavior of mr.
benfield to himself personally; and what were the particulars? he said,
he did so, and related to him the following particulars. about fifteen
days after [[lord]] pigot's confinement, mr. benfield came to tanjore, and
delivered the rajah two letters from the then governor, mr.
stratton,--one [[public]], and the other private. he demanded an immediate
account of the presents [[present]] which had been made to [[lord]] pigot, payment of
the tunkahs which he (mr. benfield) had received from the nabob upon the
country, and that the rajah should only write such letters to the madras
government as mr. benfield should approve and give to him. the rajah
answered, that he did not acknowledge the validity of any demands made
by the nabob upon the [[country]]; that those tunkahs related to accounts
which he (the rajah) had no concern with; that he never had given lord
pigot any presents [[present]], but [[lord]] pigot had given him many; and that as to
his correspondence with the madras [[government]], he would not trouble mr.
benfield, because he would write his letters himself. that the rajah
told the witness, that by [[reason]] of this [[answer]] he was much threatened,
in consequence of which he [[desired]] colonel harper, who then commanded at
tanjore, to be [[present]] at his next interview with mr. benfield; when
mr. benfield denied many parts of the preceding conversation, and threw
the blame upon his interpreter, comroo. when mr. benfield found (as the
rajah informed him) that he could not carry these points which had
brought him to tanjore, he prepared to set off for madras; that the
rajah sent him a letter which he had drawn out in [[answer]] to one which
mr. benfield had brought him; that mr. benfield disapproved of the
answer, and returned it by comroo to the durbar, who did not deliver it
into the rajah's hands, but threw it upon the ground, and expressed
himself improperly to him.

being [[asked]], whether it was at the [[king]] of tanjore's [[desire]], that such
persons as mr. benfield and comroo had been brought into his presence?
he said, the rajah told him, that, when [[lord]] pigot came to tanjore, to
restore him to his dominions, comroo, without being sent for, or desired
to come to the palace, had found means to get access to his [[person]]: he
made an offer of introducing mr. benfield to the rajah, which he
declined.--being [[asked]], whether the [[military]] officer commanding there
protected the rajah from the intrusion of such [[people]]? he said, the
rajah did not tell him that he called upon the [[military]] officer to
prevent these intrusions, but that he [[desired]] colonel harper to be
present as a witness to what might pass between him and mr.
benfield.--being [[asked]], if it is usual for persons [[person]] of the conditions and
occupations of mr. benfield and comroo to intrude themselves into the
presence of the princes [[prince]] of the [[country]], and to treat them with such
freedom? he said, certainly it is not: less there than in any other
country.--being [[asked]], whether the [[king]] of tanjore has no ministers to
whom application might be made to transact such [[business]] as mr. benfield
and comroo had to do in the [[country]]? he said, undoubtedly: his minister
is the [[person]] whose province it is to transact that [[business]].--being
asked, before the [[invasion]] of the british [[troops]] into tanjore, what
would have been the consequence, if mr. benfield had intruded himself
into the rajah's presence, and behaved in that manner? he said, he could
not say what would have been the consequence; but the attempt would have
been madness, and could not have happened.--being [[asked]], whether the
rajah had not particular exceptions to comroo, and [[thought]] he had
betrayed him in very essential points? he said, yes, he had.--being
asked, whether the rajah has not been apprised that the company have
made stipulations that their servants should not interfere in the
concerns of his [[government]]? he said, he signified it to the rajah, that
it was the company's positive orders, and that any of their servants so
interfering would incur their highest displeasure.

_commissioners' amended clauses for the fort st. george dispatch,
relative to the indeterminate mights and pretensions of the nabob of
arcot and rajah of tanjore._


in our letter of the 28th january [[last]] we stated the reasonableness of
our expectation that [[certain]] contributions towards the expenses of the
war should be made by the rajah of tanjore. since writing that letter,
we have received one from the rajah, of the 15th of october [[last]], which
contains at length his representations of his inability to make such
further payment. we [[think]] it unnecessary here to discuss whether these
representations are or are not exaggerated, because, from the
explanations we have given of our wishes [[wish]] for a new arrangement in
future, both with the nabob of arcot and the rajah of tanjore, and the
directions we have given you to carry that arrangement into execution,
we [[think]] it impolitic to insist upon any demands upon the rajah for the
expenses of the late [[war]], beyond the sum of four lacs of pagodas
annually: such a demand might tend to interrupt the harmony which should
prevail between the company and the rajah, and impede the [[great]] objects
of the general [[system]] we have already so fully explained to you.

but although it is not our [[opinion]] that any further claim should be made
on the rajah for his share of the extraordinary expenses of the late
war, it is by no means our intention in any manner to affect the just
claim which the nabob has on the rajah for the arrears due to him on
account of peshcush, for the regular payment of which we became guaranty
by the treaty of 1762; but we have already expressed to you our hopes
that the nabob may be induced to allow these arrears and the growing
payments, when due, to be received by the company, and carried in
discharge of his debt to us. you are at the same [[time]] to use every means
to convince him, that, when this debt shall be discharged, it is our
intention, as we are bound by the above treaty, to exert ourselves to
the utmost of our [[power]] to insure the constant and regular payment of it
into his own hands.

we observe, by the plan sent to us by our governor of fort st. george,
on the 30th october, 1781, that an arrangement is there proposed for the
receipt of those arrears from the rajah in three years.

we are unable to decide how far this proposal may be consistent with the
present [[state]] of the rajah's resources; but we direct you to use all
proper means to bring these arrears to account as soon as possible,
consistently with a due attention to this consideration.

       *       *       *       *       *

clauses h.

you will observe, that, by the 38th section of the late act of
parliament, it is enacted, that, for settling upon a permanent
foundation the [[present]] indeterminate rights [[right]] of the nabob of arcot and
the rajah of tanjore with [[respect]] to each other, we should take into our
immediate consideration the said indeterminate rights [[right]] and pretensions,
and take and pursue such measures as in our [[judgment]] and discretion
shall be [[best]] calculated to ascertain and settle the same, according to
the principles [[principle]] and the terms and stipulations contained in the treaty of
1762 between the said nabob and the said rajah.

on a retrospect of the proceedings transmitted to us from your
presidency, on the [[subject]] of the disputes which have heretofore arisen
between the nabob and the rajah, we find the following points remain
unadjusted, viz.

1st, whether the jaghire of arnee shall be enjoyed by the nabob, or
delivered up, either to the rajah, or the descendants of tremaul row,
the late jaghiredar.

2d, whether the fort and district of hanamantagoody, which is admitted
by both parties to be within the marawar, ought to be possessed by the
nabob, or to be delivered up by him to the rajah.

3rd, to whom the [[government]] share of the crop of the tanjore [[country]], of
the year 1775-6, properly belongs.

lastly, whether the rajah has a [[right]], by usage and custom, or ought,
from the necessity of the case, to be permitted to repair such part of
the anicut, or dam and banks of the cavery, as [[lie]] within the district
of trichinopoly, and to take [[earth]] and sand in the trichinopoly
territory for the repairs of the dam and banks within either or both of
those districts.

in order to obtain a complete [[knowledge]] of the facts [[fact]] and circumstances
relative to the several points in dispute, and how far they are
connected with the treaty of 1762, we have with [[great]] circumspection
examined into all the materials before us on these subjects [[subject]], and will
proceed to [[state]] to you the result of our inquiries and deliberations.

the objects of the treaty of 1762 appear to be restricted to the arrears
of tribute to be paid to the nabob for his [[past]] claims, and to the
quantum of the rajah's future tribute or peshcush; the cancelling of a
certain bond given by the rajah's [[father]] to the [[father]] of the nabob; the
confirmation to the rajah of the districts of coveladdy and elangaud,
and the restoration of tremaul row to his jaghire of arnee, in
condescension to the rajah's request, upon [[certain]] stipulations, viz.,
that the fort of arnee and doby gudy should be retained by the nabob;
that tremaul row should not erect any fortress, walled pagoda, or other
stronghold, nor any wall round his dwelling-house exceeding eight feet
high or two feet thick, and should in all things behave himself with
due [[obedience]] to the [[government]]; and that he should [[pay]] yearly, in the
month of july, unto the nabob or his successors, the sum of ten thousand
rupees: the rajah thereby becoming the security for tremaul row, that he
should in all things demean and behave himself accordingly, and pay
yearly the stipulated sum.

upon a review of this treaty, the only point now in dispute, which
appears to us to be so immediately connected with it as to bring it
within the strict line of our [[duty]] to ascertain and settle according to
the terms and stipulations of the treaty, is that respecting arnee. for,
although the other points enumerated may in some respects [[respect]] have a
relation to that treaty, yet, as they are [[foreign]] to the purposes
expressed in it, and could not be in the contemplation of the
contracting parties at the [[time]] of making it, those disputes cannot in
our comprehension fall within the line of description of rights [[right]] and
pretensions to be now ascertained and settled by us, according to any of
the terms and stipulations of it.

in [[respect]] to the jaghire of arnee, we do not find that our records
afford us any satisfactory information by what title the rajah claims
it, or what [[degree]] of relationship or connection has subsisted between
the rajah and the killadar of arnee, save only that by the treaty of
1762 the former became the surety for tremaul row's performance of his
engagements specified therein, as the conditions for his restoration to
that jaghire; on the [[death]] of tremaul row, we perceive that he was
succeeded by his widow, and after her [[death]], by his grandson
seneewasarow, both of whom were admitted to the jaghire by the nabob.

from your minutes of consultation of the 31st october, 1770, and the
nabob's letter to the president of the 21st march, 1771, and the two
letters from rajah beerbur atchenur punt (who we presume was then the
nabob's manager at arcot) of the 16th and 18th march, referred to in the
nabob's letter, and transmitted therewith to the president, we observe,
that, previous to the treaty of 1762, mr. pigot concurred in the
expediency of the nabob's taking possession of this jaghire, on account
of the troublesome and refractory behavior of the arnee braminees, by
their affording protection to all disturbers, who, by [[reason]] of the
little distance between arnee and arcot, fled to the former, and were
there protected, and not given up, though demanded;--that, though the
jaghire was restored in 1762, it was done under such conditions and
restrictions as were [[thought]] [[best]] calculated to preserve the [[peace]] and
good order of the place and due [[obedience]] to [[government]];--that,
nevertheless, the braminees (quarrelling among themselves) did
afterwards, in express violation of the treaty, enlist and assemble many
thousand sepoys, and other [[troops]]; that they erected gaddies and other
small forts, provided themselves with wall-pieces, small guns, and other
warlike stores, and raised troubles and disturbances in the neighborhood
of the [[city]] of arcot and the forts of arnee and shaw gaddy; and that,
finally, they imprisoned the hircarrahs of the nabob, sent with his
letters and instructions, in pursuance of the [[advice]] of your board, to
require [[certain]] of the braminees to repair to the nabob at chepauk, and,
though peremptorily required to repair thither, paid no regard to those,
or to any other orders from the circar.

by the 13th article contained in the instructions given by the nabob to
mr. dupré, as the basis for negotiating the treaty made with the rajah
in 1771, the nabob required that the arnee district should be delivered
up to the circar, because the braminees had broken the conditions which
they were to have observed. in the answers [[answer]] given by the rajah to these
propositions, he says, "i am to give up to the circar the jaghire
district of arnee"; and on the 7th of november, 1771, the rajah, by
letter to seneewasarow, who appears by your consultations and country
correspondence to have been the grandson of tremaul row, and to have
been put in possession of the jaghire at your recommendation, (on the
death of his grandmother,) writes, acquainting him that he had given the
arnee [[country]], then in his (seneewasarow's) possession, to the nabob, to
whose aumildars seneewasarow was to deliver up the possession of the
country. and in your letter to us of the 28th february, 1772, you
certified the district of arnee to be one of the countries [[country]] acquired by
this treaty, and to be of the estimated value of two lacs of rupees per
annum.

in our orders dated the 12th of april, 1775, we declared our
determination to replace the rajah upon the [[throne]] of his [[ancestors]],
upon [[certain]] terms and conditions, to be agreed upon for the mutual
benefit of himself and the company, without infringing the rights [[right]] of the
nabob. we declared that our [[faith]] stood pledged by the treaty of 1762 to
obtain payment of the rajah's tribute to the nabob, and that for the
insuring such payment the fort of tanjore should be garrisoned by our
troops. we directed that you should [[pay]] no regard to the article of the
treaty of 1771 which respected the alienation of part of the rajah's
dominions; and we declared, that, if the nabob had not a just title to
those territories before the conclusion of the treaty, we denied that he
obtained any [[right]] thereby, except such temporary sovereignty, for
securing the payment of his expenses, as is therein mentioned.

these instructions appear to have been executed in the month of april,
1776; and by your letter of the 14th may following you certified to us
that the rajah had been put into the possession of the whole [[country]] his
father held in 1762, when the treaty was concluded with the nabob; but
we do not find that you came to any resolution, either antecedent or
subsequent to this [[advice]], either for questioning or impeaching the
right of the nabob to the sovereignty of arnee, or expressive of any
doubt of his title to it. nevertheless, we find, that, although the
board passed no such resolution, yet your president, in his letter to
the nabob of the 30th july and 24th august, called upon his highness to
give up the possession of arnee to the rajah; and the rajah himself, in
several letters to us, particularly in those of 21st october, 1776, and
the 7th of june, 1777, expressed his expectation of our orders for
delivering up that fort and district to him; and so recently as the 15th
of october, 1783, he reminds us of his former application, and states,
that the [[country]] of arnee being guarantied to him by the company, it of
course is his [[right]], but that it has not been given up to him, and he
therefore earnestly entreats our orders for putting him into the
possession of it. we also observe by your letter of the 14th of october,
1779, that the rajah had not then accounted for the nabob's peshcush
since his restoration, but had assigned as a [[reason]] for his withdrawing
it, that the nabob had retained from him the district of arnee, with a
certain other district, (hanamantagoody,) which is made the [[subject]] of
another part of our [[present]] dispatches.

we have thus stated to you the result of our inquiry into the grounds of
the dispute relative to arnee; and as the research has offered no
evidence in support of the rajah's claim, nor even any lights [[light]] whereby we
can discover in what [[degree]] of relationship, by consanguinity, caste, or
other circumstances, the rajah now stands, or formerly stood, with the
killadar of arnee, or the [[nature]] of his connection with or command over
that district, or the [[authority]] he exercised or assumed previous to the
treaty of 1771, we should [[think]] ourselves highly reprehensible in
complying with the rajah's request,--and the more so, as it is expressly
stated, in the treaty of 1762, that this fort and district were then in
the possession of the nabob, as well as the [[person]] of the jaghiredar, on
account of his disobedience, and were restored him by the nabob, in
condescension to the rajah's request, upon such terms and stipulations
as could not, in our [[judgment]], have been imposed by the one or submitted
to by the other, if the sovereignty of the one or the dependency of the
other had been at that [[time]] a matter of [[doubt]].

although these materials have not furnished us with evidence in support
of the rajah's claim, they are far from satisfactory to evince the
justice of or the [[political]] necessity for the nabob's continuing to
withhold the jaghire from the descendants of tremaul row; his hereditary
right to that jaghire seems to us to have been fully recognized by the
stipulations of the treaty of 1762, and so little doubted, that, on his
death, his widow was admitted by the nabob to hold it, on account, as
may be presumed, of the nonage of his grandson and heir, seneewasarow,
who appears to have been confirmed in the jaghire, on her [[death]], by the
nabob, as the lineal heir and successor to his grandfather.

with [[respect]] to seneewasarow, it does not appear, by any of the
proceedings in our possession, that he was concerned in the misconduct
of the braminees, complained of by the nabob in the year 1770, which
rendered it necessary for his highness to take the jaghire into his own
hands, or that he was privy to or could have prevented those
disturbances.

we therefore direct, that, if the heir of tremaul row is not at present
in possession of the jaghire, and has not, by any violation of the
treaty, or act of disobedience, incurred a forfeiture thereof, he be
forthwith restored to the possession of it, according to the terms and
stipulations of the treaty of 1762. but if any powerful motive of regard
to the [[peace]] and tranquillity of the carnatic shall in your judgment
render it expedient to suspend the execution of these orders, in that
case you are with all convenient speed to transmit to us your
proceedings thereupon, with the full [[state]] of the facts [[fact]], and of the
reasons which have actuated your conduct.

we have before given it as our [[opinion]] that the stipulations of the
treaty of 1762 do not apply to the points remaining to be decided. but
the late act of [[parliament]] having, from the [[nature]] of our connection
with the two powers [[power]] in the carnatic, pointed out the expediency, and
even necessity, of settling the several matters in dispute between them
by a speedy and permanent arrangement, we now proceed to give you our
instructions upon, the several other heads of disputes before
enumerated.

with [[respect]] to the fort and district of hanamantagoody, we observe,
that, on the restoration of the rajah in 1776, you informed us in your
letter of the 14th of may, that the rajah had been put into possession
of the whole of the [[country]] his [[father]] held in 1762, when the treaty was
concluded with the nabob; and on the 25th of june you came to the
resolution of putting the rajah into possession of hanamantagoody, on
the ground of its appearing, on reference to the nabob's instructions to
mr. dupré in june, 1762, to his reply, and to the rajah's
representations of 25th march, 1771, that hanamantagoody was actually in
the hands of the late rajah at the [[time]] of making the treaty of 1762. we
have referred as well to those papers as to all the other proceedings on
this [[subject]], and must confess they fall very short of demonstrating to
us the [[truth]] of that [[fact]]. and we find, by the secret consultations of
fort william of the 7th of august, 1776, that the same [[doubt]] was
entertained by our governor-general and council.

but whether, in point of [[fact]], the late rajah was or was not in
possession of hanamantagoody in 1762, it is notorious that the nabob had
always claimed the dominion of the countries [[country]] of which this fort and
district are a part.

we observe that the nabob is now in the actual possession of this fort
and district; and we are not warranted, by any document we have seen, to
concur with the wishes [[wish]] of the rajah to dispossess him.

with regard to the [[government]] share of the crop of 1775-6, we observe by
the dobeer's memorandum, recited in your consultations of the 13th of
may, 1776, that it was the established custom of the tanjore [[country]] to
gather in the harvest and complete the collections within the month of
march, but that, for the causes therein particularly stated, the harvest
(and of course the collection of the [[government]] share of the crop) was
delayed till the month of march was over. we also observe that the rajah
was not restored to his [[kingdom]] until the 11th of april, 1776; and from
hence we infer, that, if the harvest and collection had been finished at
the usual [[time]], the nabob (being then [[sovereign]] of the country) would
have received the full benefit of that year's crop.

although the harvest and collection were delayed beyond the usual [[time]],
yet we find by the proceedings of your [[government]], and particularly by
mr. mackay's minute of the 29th of may, 1776, and also by the dobeer's
account, that the [[greatest]] part of the grain was cut down whilst the
nabob remained in the [[government]] of the [[country]].

it is difficult, from the contradictory allegations on the [[subject]], to
ascertain what was the precise amount of the collections made after the
nabob ceased to have the possession of the [[country]]. but whatever it was,
it appears from general stuart's letter of the 2d of april, 1777, that
it had been asserted with [[good]] [[authority]] that the far greater part of
the [[government]] share of the crop was plundered by individuals [[individual]], and never
came to account in the rajah's treasury.

under all the circumstances of this case, we must be of [[opinion]] that the
government share of the crop of 1776 belonged to the nabob, as the then
reigning [[sovereign]] of the [[kingdom]] of tanjore, he being, _de facto_, in
the full and absolute possession of the [[government]] thereof; and
consequently that the assignments made by him of the [[government]] share of
the crop were valid.

nevertheless, we would by no means be understood by this [[opinion]] to
suggest that any further demands ought to be made upon the rajah, in
respect of such parts of the [[government]] share of the crop as were
collected by his [[people]].

for, on the contrary, after so [[great]] a length of [[time]] as hath elapsed,
we should [[think]] it highly [[unjust]] that the rajah should be now compelled
either to [[pay]] the supposed balances, whatever they may be, or be called
upon to render a specific account of the collection made by his [[people]].

the rajah has already, in his letter to governor stratton of the 21st of
april, 1777, given his assurance, that the [[produce]] of the preceding
year, accounted for to him, was little more than one lac of pagodas; and
as you have acquainted us, by your letter of the 14th of october, 1779,
that the rajah has actually paid into our treasury one lac of pagodas,
by way of deposit, on account of the nabob's claims to the crop, till
our sentiments should be known, we direct you to surcease any further
demands from the rajah on that account.

we learn by the proceedings, and particularly by the nabob's letter to
lord pigot of the 6th of july, 1776, that the nabob, previous to the
restoration of the rajah, actually made assignments or granted tunkaws
of the whole of his share of the crop to his creditors and [[troops]]; and
that your [[government]], (entertaining the same [[opinion]] as we do upon the
question of [[right]] to that share,) by letter to the rajah of the 20th of
august, 1776, recommended to him "to restore to mr. benfield (one of the
principal assignees or tunkaw-holders of the nabob) the grain of the
last year, which was in possession of his [[people]], and said to be
forcibly taken from them,--and farther, to give mr. benfield all
reasonable assistance in recovering such debts as should appear to have
been justly due to him from the inhabitants; and acquainted the rajah
that it had been judged by a majority of the council that it was the
company's intention to let the nabob have the [[produce]] of the crop of
1776, but that you had no intention that the rajah should be accountable
for more than the [[government]] share, whatever that might be; and that you
did not mean to do more than recommend to him to see [[justice]] done,
leaving the manner and [[time]] to himself." subsequent representations
appear to have been made to the rajah by your [[government]] on the same
subject, in favor of the nabob's mortgages.

in [[answer]] to these applications, the rajah, in his letter to mr.
stratton of the 12th january, 1777, acquainted you "that he had given
orders respecting the grain which mr. benfield had heaped up in his
country; and with regard to the [[money]] due to him by the farmers [[farmer]], that he
had [[desired]] mr. benfield to bring accounts of it, that he might limit a
time for the payment of it proportionably to their ability, and that the
necessary orders for stopping this [[money]] out of the inhabitants' share
of the crop had been sent to the ryots and aumildars; that mr.
benfield's gomastah was then [[present]] there, and oversaw his affairs; and
that in everything that was just he (the rajah) willingly obeyed our
governor and council."

our [[opinion]] being that the rajah ought to be answerable for no more than
the amount of what he admits was collected by his [[people]] for the
government share of the crop; and the proceedings before us not
sufficiently explaining whether, in the sum which the rajah, by his
before-mentioned letter of the 21st april, 1777, admits to have
collected, are included those parts of the [[government]] share of the crop
which were taken by his [[people]] from mr. benfield, or from any other of
the assignees or tunkaw-holders; and uninformed, as we also are, what
compensation the rajah has or has not made to mr. benfield, or any other
of the parties from whom the grain was taken by the rajah's [[people]]; or
whether, by means of the rajah's refusal so to do, or from any other
circumstance, any of the persons [[person]] dispossessed of their grain may have
had recourse to the nabob for satisfaction: we are, for these reasons [[reason]],
incompetent to form a proper [[judgment]] what disposition ought in justice
to be made of the one lac of pagodas deposited by the rajah. but as our
sentiments and intentions are so fully expressed upon the whole [[subject]],
we presume you, who are upon the spot, can have no [[doubt]] or difficulty
in making such an application of the deposit as will be consistent with
those principles [[principle]] of [[justice]] whereon our sentiments are founded. but
should any such difficulty suggest itself, you will suspend any
application of the deposit, until you have fully explained the same to
us, and have received our further orders.

with [[respect]] to the repairs of the anicut and banks of the cavery we
have upon various occasions [[occasion]] fully expressed to you our sentiments, and
in particular in our general letter of the 4th july, 1777, we referred
you to the investigation and correspondence on that [[subject]] of the year
1764, and to the report made by mr. james bourchier, on his personal
survey of the waters, and to several letters of the year 1765 and 1767;
we also, by our said general letter, acquainted you that it appeared to
us perfectly reasonable that the rajah should be permitted to repair
those banks, and the anicut, in the same manner as had been practised in
times [[past]]; and we directed you to establish such regulations, by
reference to former usage, for keeping the said banks in repair, as
would be effectual, and remove all cause of complaint in future.

notwithstanding such our instructions, the rajah, in his letter to us of
the 15th october, 1783, complains of the destruction of the anicut; and
as the cultivation of the tanjore [[country]] appears, by all the surveys
and reports of our engineers employed on that service, to depend
altogether on a supply of water by the cavery, which can only be secured
by keeping the anicut and banks in repair, we [[think]] it necessary to
repeat to you our orders of the 4th july, 1777, on the [[subject]] of those
repairs.

and further, as it appears by the survey and report of mr. pringle, that
those repairs are attended with a much heavier expense, when done with
materials taken from the tanjore district, than with those of
trichinopoly, and that the last-mentioned materials are far preferable
to the other, it is our order, that, if any occurrences should make it
necessary or expedient, you apply to the nabob, in our name, to desire
that his highness will permit proper spots of ground to be set out, and
bounded by proper marks on the trichinopoly side, where the rajah and
his [[people]] may at all times [[time]] take sand and [[earth]] sufficient for these
repairs; and that his highness will grant his lease of such spots of
land for a [[certain]] term of years to the company, at a reasonable annual
rent, to the intent that through you the cultivation of the tanjore
country may be secured, without infringing or impairing the rights [[right]] of
the nabob.

if any attempts have been or shall be hereafter made to divert the water
from the cavery into the coleroon, by contracting the current of the
upper or lower cavery, by planting long grass, as mentioned in mr.
pringle's report, or by any other means, we have no [[doubt]] his highness,
on a proper representation to him in our name, will prevent his people
from taking any measures detrimental to the tanjore [[country]], in the
prosperity of which his highness, as well as the company, is materially
interested.

should you succeed in reconciling the nabob to this measure, we [[think]] it
but just that the proposed lease shall remain no longer in [[force]] than
whilst the rajah shall be punctual in the payment of the annual peshcush
to the nabob, as well as the rent to be reserved for the spots of
ground. and in order effectually to remove all future occasions [[occasion]] of
jealousy and complaint between the parties,--that the rajah, on the one
hand, may be satisfied that all necessary works [[work]] for the cultivation of
his [[country]] will be made and kept in repair, and that the nabob, on the
other hand, may be satisfied that no encroachment on his rights [[right]] can be
made, nor any works [[work]] detrimental to the fertility of his country
erected,--we [[think]] it proper that it should be recommended to the
parties, as a part of the adjustment of this very important point, that
skilful engineers, appointed by the company, be employed at the rajah's
expense to conduct all the necessary works [[work]], with the strictest attention
to the respective rights [[right]] and interests of both parties. this will remove
every probability of injury or dispute. but should either party
unexpectedly conceive themselves to be injured, immediate redress might
be obtained by application to the [[government]] of madras, under whose
appointment the engineer will act, without any discussion between the
parties, which might disturb that harmony which it is so much the wish
of the company to establish and preserve, as essential to the prosperity
and [[peace]] of the carnatic.

having now, in [[obedience]] to the directions of the act of [[parliament]],
upon the fullest consideration of the indeterminate rights [[right]] and
pretensions of the nabob and rajah, pointed out such measures and
arrangements as in our [[judgment]] and discretion will be [[best]] calculated
to ascertain and settle the same, we [[hope]], that, upon a candid
consideration of the whole [[system]], although each of the parties may feel
disappointed in our decision on particular points, they will be
convinced that we have been guided in our investigation by principles [[principle]] of
strict [[justice]] and impartiality, and that the most anxious attention has
been paid to the substantial interests of both parties, and such a
general and comprehensive plan of arrangement proposed as will most
effectually prevent all future dissatisfaction.

_extract of a letter from the court of directors to the president and
council of fort st. george, as amended and approved by the board of
control._


we have taken into our consideration the several advices and papers
received from [[india]], relative to the assignment of the revenues [[revenue]] of the
carnatic, from the conclusion of the bengal treaty to the date of your
letter in october, 1783, together with the representations of the nabob
of the carnatic upon that [[subject]]; and although we might contend that
the agreement should subsist till we are fully reimbursed his highness's
proportion of the expenses of the [[war]], yet, from a [[principle]] of
moderation, and personal attachment to our old ally, his highness the
nabob of the carnatic, for whose [[dignity]] and [[happiness]] we are ever
solicitous, and to cement more strongly, if possible, that mutual
harmony and confidence which our connection makes so essentially
necessary for our reciprocal safety and welfare, _and for removing from
his [[mind]] every [[idea]] of secret design on our part to lessen his authority
over the internal [[government]] of the carnatic_, and the collection and
administration of its revenues [[revenue]], we have resolved that the assignment
shall be surrendered; and we do accordingly direct our president, in
whose name the assignment was taken, _without delay_, to [[surrender]] the
same to his highness. but while we have adopted this resolution, we
repose entire confidence in his highness, that, actuated by the same
motives of liberality, and feelings of old [[friendship]] and [[alliance]], he
will cheerfully and instantly accede to such arrangements as are
necessary to be adopted for our [[common]] safety, and for preserving the
respect, rights [[right]], and interests we enjoy in the carnatic. the following
are the heads and principles [[principle]] of such an arrangement as we are decisively
of [[opinion]] must be adopted for these purposes [[purpose]], viz.

that, for making a provision for discharging the nabob's just debts to
the company and individuals [[individual]], (for the payment of which his highness has
so frequently expressed the [[greatest]] solicitude,) _the nabob shall give
soucar security for the punctual payment, by instalments_, into the
company's treasury, of twelve lacs of pagodas per annum, (as voluntarily
proposed by his highness,) until those debts, with interest, shall be
discharged; and shall also [[consent]] that the equitable provision lately
made by the british legislature for the liquidation of those debts, _and
such resolutions and determinations as we shall hereafter make_, under
the [[authority]] of that provision for the liquidation and adjustment of
the said debts, _bonâ fide_ incurred, shall be carried into full force
and effect.

should any difficulty arise between his highness and our [[government]] of
fort st. george, in [[respect]] to _the responsibility of the soucar
security_, or the times [[time]] and terms of the instalments, it is our pleasure
that you [[pay]] [[obedience]] to the orders and resolutions of our
governor-general and council of bengal in [[respect]] thereto, not doubting
but the nabob will in such case [[consent]] to abide by the determination of
our said supreme [[government]].

although, from the [[great]] confidence we repose in the [[honor]] and integrity
of the nabob, and from an earnest [[desire]] not to [[subject]] him to any
embarrassment on this [[occasion]], we have not proposed any specific
assignment of territory or [[revenue]] for securing the payments aforesaid,
we nevertheless [[think]] it our [[duty]], as well to the private creditors,
whose interests in this [[respect]] have been so solemnly intrusted to us by
the late act of [[parliament]], as from regard to the debt due to the
company, to insist on a declaration, that, in the event of the failure
of the security proposed, or in default of payment at the stipulated
periods, we reserve to ourselves full [[right]] to demand of the nabob such
_additional security_, by assignment on his [[country]], as shall be
effectual for answering the purposes [[purpose]] of the agreement.

after having conciliated the [[mind]] of the nabob to this measure, and
adjusted the particulars, you are to carry the same into execution by a
formal deed between his highness and the company, according to the tenor
of these instructions.

as the administration of the british interests and connections in india
has in some respects [[respect]] assumed a new shape by the late act of [[parliament]],
and a general [[peace]] in [[india]] has been happily accomplished, the present
appears to us to be the proper period, and which cannot without great
imprudence be omitted, to settle and arrange, by a just and equitable
treaty, a plan for the future defence and protection of the carnatic,
both in [[time]] of [[peace]] and [[war]], on a solid and lasting foundation.

for the accomplishment of this [[great]] and necessary object, we direct
you, in the name of the company, to use your utmost endeavors to impress
the expediency of, and the [[good]] effects to be derived from this measure,
so strongly upon the minds [[mind]] of the nabob and the rajah of tanjore, as to
prevail upon them, jointly or separately, to enter into one or more
treaty or treaties with the company, grounded on this [[principle]] of
equity: that all the contracting parties shall be bound to contribute
jointly to the support of the [[military]] [[force]] and garrisons, as well in
peace as in [[war]].

that the [[military]] [[peace]] establishment shall be forthwith settled and
adjusted by the company, in pursuance of the [[authority]] and directions
given to them by the late act of [[parliament]].

as the payment of the [[troops]] and garrisons, occasional expenses in the
repairs and improvements of fortifications, and other services
incidental to a [[military]] establishment, must of necessity be punctual
and accurate, no latitude of personal assurance or reciprocal confidence
of either of the parties on the other must be accepted or required; but
the nabob and rajah must of necessity specify particular districts and
revenues for securing the due and regular payment of their contributions
into the treasury of the company, with whom the charge of the defence of
the coast, and of course the [[power]] of the [[sword]], must be exclusively
intrusted, with [[power]] for the company, in case of failure or default of
such payments at the stipulated times [[time]] and seasons, to enter upon and
possess such districts, and to let the same to renters, to be confirmed
by the nabob and the rajah respectively; but, trusting that in the
execution of this part of the arrangement no undue obstruction will be
given by either of those powers [[power]], we direct that this part of the treaty
be coupled with a most positive assurance, on our part, of our
determination to support the [[dignity]] and [[authority]] of the nabob and
rajah in the exclusive administration of the civil [[government]] and
revenues of their respective countries [[country]];--and further, that, in case of
_any_ hostility committed against the territories of either of the
contracting parties on the coast of coromandel, the whole revenues [[revenue]] of
their respective territories shall be considered as one [[common]] stock, to
be appropriated in the [[common]] cause of their defence; that the company,
on their part, shall engage to refrain, _during the war_, from the
application of any part of their revenues [[revenue]] to any commercial purposes
whatsoever, but apply the whole, save only the ordinary charges of their
civil [[government]], to the purposes [[purpose]] of the [[war]]; that the nabob and the
rajah shall in like manner engage, on their parts, to refrain, during
the [[war]], from the application of any part of their revenues [[revenue]], save only
what shall be actually necessary for the support of themselves and the
civil [[government]] of their respective countries [[country]], to any other purposes
than that of defraying the expenses of such [[military]] operations as the
company may find it necessary to carry on for the [[common]] safety of their
interests on the coast of coromandel.

and to obviate any difficulties or misunderstanding which might arise
from leaving indeterminate the sum necessary to be appropriated for the
civil establishment of each of the respective powers [[power]], that the sum be
now ascertained which is indispensably necessary to be applied to those
purposes, and which is to be held [[sacred]] under every emergency, and set
apart previous to the application of the rest of the revenues [[revenue]], as hereby
stipulated, for the purposes [[purpose]] of mutual or [[common]] defence against any
enemy, for _clearing_ the incumbrance which may have become necessarily
incurred in addition to the expenditure of those revenues [[revenue]] _which must be
always deemed part of the [[war]] establishment_. this we [[think]] absolutely
necessary; as nothing can tend so much to the preservation of [[peace]], and
to prevent the renewal of hostilities, as the early putting the finances
of the several powers [[power]] upon a clear footing, and the showing to all other
powers that the company, the nabob, and the rajah are firmly [[united]] in
one [[common]] cause, and combined in one [[system]] of permanent and vigorous
defence, for the preservation of their respective territories and the
general tranquillity.

that the whole aggregate [[revenue]] of the contracting parties shall,
during the [[war]], be under the application of the company, and shall
continue as long after the [[war]] _as shall be necessary, to discharge the
burdens contracted by it_; but it must be declared that this provision
shall in no [[respect]] extend to deprive either the nabob or the rajah of
the substantial [[authority]] necessary to the collection of the revenues [[revenue]] of
their respective countries [[country]]. but it is meant that they shall faithfully
perform the conditions of this arrangement; and if a division of any
part of the revenues [[revenue]] to any other than the stipulated purposes [[purpose]] shall
take place, the company shall be entitled to take upon themselves the
collection of the [[revenue]].

the company are to engage, during the [[time]] they shall administer the
revenues, to [[produce]] to the other contracting parties regular accounts
of the application thereof to the purposes [[purpose]] stipulated by the treaty, and
faithfully apply them in support of the [[war]].

and, lastly, as the defence of the carnatic is thus to rest with the
company, the nabob shall be satisfied of the propriety of avoiding all
unnecessary expense, and will therefore agree not to maintain a greater
number of [[troops]] than shall be necessary for the support of his dignity
and the splendor of the durbar, which number shall be specified in the
treaty; and if any [[military]] aid is requisite for the security and
collection of his revenues [[revenue]], other than the fixed establishment employed
to enforce the ordinary collections and preserve the [[police]] of the
country, the company must be bound to furnish him with such aid: the
rajah of tanjore must likewise become bound by similar engagements, and
be entitled to similar aid.

as, in [[virtue]] of the powers [[power]] vested in [[lord]] macartney by the agreement of
december, 1781, sundry leases, of various periods, have been granted to
renters, we direct that you apply to the nabob, in our name, for his
consent that they may be _permitted_ to hold their leases to the end of
the stipulated term; and we have [[great]] reliance[70] on the liberality
and spirit of accommodation manifested by the nabob on so many
occasions, that he will be disposed to acquiesce in a proposition so
_just and reasonable_. but if, contrary to our expectations, his
highness should be impressed with any particular aversion to comply with
this proposition, we do not [[desire]] you to insist upon it as an essential
part of the arrangement to take place between us; but, in that event,
you must take especial [[care]] to give such indemnification to the renters
for any loss they may sustain as you [[judge]] to be reasonable.

it equally concerns the [[honor]] of our [[government]], that such natives as
may have been put in any [[degree]] of [[authority]] over the collections, in
consequence of the deed of assignment, and who have proved faithful to
their trust, shall not suffer inconvenience on account of their
fidelity.

having thus given our sentiments at large, as well for the [[surrender]] of
the assignment as with regard to those arrangements which we think
necessary to adopt in consequence thereof, we cannot dismiss this
subject without expressing our highest approbation of _the ability,
moderation, and command of temper_ with which our president at madras
has conducted himself in the management of a very delicate and
embarrassing situation. his conduct, and that of the select committee of
fort st. george, in the execution of the trust delegated to lord
macartney by the nabob mahomed ali, has been vigorous and effectual, for
the [[purpose]] of realizing as [[great]] a [[revenue]], at a crisis of necessity,
as the [[nature]] of the case admitted; and the imputation of [[corruption]],
suggested in some of the proceedings, appears to be totally groundless
and unwarranted.

while we find so much to applaud, it is with regret we are induced to
advert to anything which may appear worthy of blame: as the step of
issuing the torana chits in [[lord]] macartney's own name can only be
justified upon the ground of absolute necessity;[71] and as his lordship
had every [[reason]] to [[believe]] that the demand, when made, would be
irksome and disagreeable to the feelings of mahomed ali, every
precaution ought to have been used and more [[time]] allowed for proving
that necessity, by previous acts of address, civility, and conciliation,
applied for the purposes [[purpose]] of obtaining his [[authority]] to such a measure.
it appears to us that more of this might have been used; and therefore
we cannot consider the omission of it as blameless, consistent with our
wishes of sanctifying no act contrary to the spirit of the agreement, or
derogatory to the [[authority]] of the nabob of the carnatic, in the
exercise of any of his just rights [[right]] in the [[government]] of the [[people]] under
his [[authority]].

we likewise observe, the nabob has complained that no official
communication was made to him of the [[peace]], for near a month after the
cessation of arms took place. this, and every other mark of disrespect
to the nabob, will ever appear highly reprehensible in our [[eyes]]; and we
direct that you do, upon all occasions [[occasion]], [[pay]] the highest attention to him
and his [[family]].

lord macartney, in his minute of the 9th of september [[last]], has been
fully under our consideration. we shall ever applaud the prudence and
foresight of our servants which induces them to collect and communicate
to us every [[opinion]], or even ground of suspicion they may entertain,
relative to any of the powers [[power]] in [[india]] with whose conduct our interest
and the safety of our settlements is essentially connected. at the same
time we earnestly recommend that those opinions [[opinion]] and speculations be
communicated to us with prudence, discretion, and all possible secrecy,
_and the terms in which they are conveyed be expressed in a manner as
little offensive as possible to the powers [[power]] whom they may concern and
into whose hands they may fall._[72]

we next proceed to give you our sentiments respecting the private debts
of the nabob; _and we cannot but acknowledge_ that the origin and
justice, both of the loan of 1767, and the loan of 1777, commonly called
the cavalry loan, appear to us clear and indisputable, agreeable to the
true sense and spirit of the late act of [[parliament]].

in speaking of the loan of 1767, we are to be understood as speaking of
the debt as constituted by the original bonds of that year, bearing
interest at 10_l._ per cent; and therefore, if any of the nabob's
creditors, under a pretence that their debts made part of the
consolidated debt of 1767, although secured by bonds of a subsequent
date, carrying an interest exceeding 10_l._ per cent, shall claim the
benefit of the following orders, we direct that you [[pay]] no regard to
such claims, without further especial instructions for that [[purpose]].

with [[respect]] to the consolidated debt of 1777, it certainly stands upon
a less favorable footing. so early as the 27th march, 1769, it was
ordered by our then president and council of fort st. george, that, for
the preventing all persons [[person]] living under the company's protection from
having any dealings with any of the [[country]] powers [[power]] or their ministers
without the [[knowledge]] or [[consent]] of the board, an advertisement should
be published, by fixing it up at the sea-gate, and sending round a copy
to the company's servants and inhabitants, and to the different
subordinates, and our garrisons, and giving it out in general orders,
stating therein that the president and council did consider the
irreversible order of the court of directors of the year 1714 (whereby
their [[people]] were prohibited from having any dealings with the country
governments in [[money]] matters) to be in full [[force]] and vigor, and thereby
expressly forbidding all servants of the company, and other europeans
under their jurisdiction, to make loans or have any [[money]] transactions
with any of the princes [[prince]] or states in [[india]], without special license and
permission of the president and council for the [[time]] being, except only
in the particular cases there mentioned, and declaring that any wilful
deviation therefrom should be deemed a breach of orders, and treated as
such. and on the 4th of march, 1778, it was resolved by our president
and council of fort st george, that the consolidated debt of 1777 was
not, on any [[respect]] whatever, conducted under the auspices or protection
of that [[government]]; and on the circumstance of the consolidation of the
said debt being made known to us, we did, on the 28rd of december, 1778,
write to you in the following terms: "your account of the nabob's
private debts is very alarming; but from whatever cause or causes those
debts have been contracted or increased, we hereby repeat our orders,
that the sanction of the company be on no account given to any [[kind]] of
security for the payment or liquidation of any part thereof, (except by
the express [[authority]] of the court of directors,) on any account or
pretence whatever."

the loan of 1777, therefore, has no sanction or [[authority]] from us; and
in considering the situation and circumstances of this loan, we cannot
omit to observe, that the creditors could not be ignorant how greatly
the affairs of the nabob were at that [[time]] deranged, and that his debt
to the company was then very considerable,--the payment of which the
parties took the most effectual means to postpone, by procuring an
assignment of such specific revenues [[revenue]] for the discharge of their own
debts as alone could have enabled the nabob to have discharged that of
the company.

under all these circumstances, we should be warranted to refuse our aid
or protection in the recovery of this loan. but when we consider the
inexpediency of keeping the [[subject]] of the nabob's debts longer afloat
than is absolutely necessary,--when we consider how much the final
conclusion of this [[business]] will tend to promote tranquillity, credit,
and circulation of [[property]] in the carnatic,--and when we consider that
the debtor concurs with the creditor in establishing the [[justice]] of
those debts consolidated in 1777 into gross sums, for which bonds were
given, liable to be transferred to persons [[person]] different from the original
creditors, and having no share or [[knowledge]] of the transactions in which
the debts originated, and of course how little ground there is to expect
any substantial [[good]] to result from an unlimited investigation into
them, we have resolved so far to recognize the [[justice]] of those debts as
to extend to them that protection which, upon _more_ forcible grounds,
we have seen cause to allow to the other two classes of debts. but
although we so far adopt the general presumption in their favor as to
admit them to a participation in the manner hereafter directed, we do
not mean to debar you from receiving any complaints against those debts
of 1777, at the instance either of the nabob himself, or of other
creditors injured by their being so admitted, or by any other persons
having a proper interest, or stating reasonable grounds of objection;
and if any complaints are offered, we order that the grounds of all such
be attentively examined by you, and be transmitted to us, together with
the evidence adduced in support of them, for our final decision; and as
we have before directed that the sum of twelve lacs of pagodas, to be
received annually from the nabob, should be paid into our treasury, it
is our order that the same be distributed according to the following
arrangement.

that the debt be made up in the following manner, viz.

the debt consolidated in 1767 to be made up to the end of the year 1784,
with the current interest at ten per cent.

the cavalry loan to be made up to the same period, with the current
interest at twelve per cent.

the debt consolidated in 1777 to be made up to the same period, with the
current interest at twelve per cent, to november, 1781, and from thence
with the current interest at six per cent.

the twelve lacs annually to be received are then to be applied,--

1. to the growing interest on the cavalry loan, at twelve per cent.

2. to the growing interest on the debt of 1777, at six per cent.

the remainder to be equally divided: one half to be applied to the
extinction of the company's debt; the other half to be applied to the
payment of growing interest at 10_l._ per cent, and towards the
discharge of the principal of the debt of 1767.

this arrangement to continue till the principal of the debt 1767 is
discharged.

the application of the twelve lacs is, then, to be,--

1. to the interest of the debt of 1777, as above. the remainder to be
then equally divided,--one half towards the discharge of the current
interest and principal of the cavalry loan, and the other half towards
the discharge of the company's debt.

when the cavalry loan shall be thus discharged, there shall then be paid
towards the discharge of the company's debt seven lacs.

to the growing interest and [[capital]] of the 1777 loan, five lacs.

when the company's debt shall be discharged, the whole is then to be
applied in discharge of the debt 1777.

if the nabob shall be prevailed upon to apply the arrears and growing
payments of the tanjore peshcush in further discharge of his debts, over
and above the twelve lacs of pagodas, we direct that the whole of that
payment, when made, shall be applied towards the reduction of the
company's debt.

we have laid down these general rules [[rule]] of distribution, as appearing to
us founded on [[justice]], and the relative circumstances of the different
debts; and therefore we give our [[authority]] and protection to them only
on the supposition that they who ask our protection acquiesce in the
condition upon which it is given; and therefore we expressly order,
that, if any creditor of the nabob, a servant of the company, or being
under our protection, shall refuse to express his acquiescence in these
arrangements, he shall not only be excluded from receiving any share of
the fund under your distribution, but shall be prohibited from taking
any separate measures to recover his debt from the nabob: it being one
great inducement to our adopting this arrangement, that the nabob shall
be relieved from all further disquietude by the importunities of his
individual creditors, and be left at [[liberty]] to pursue those measures
for the [[prosperity]] of his [[country]] which the embarrassments of his
situation have hitherto deprived him of the means of exerting. and we
further direct, that, if any creditor shall be found refractory, or
disposed to disturb the arrangement we have suggested, he shall be
dismissed the service, and sent [[home]] to [[england]].

the directions we have given only apply to the three classes of debts
which have come under our observation. it has been surmised that the
nabob has of late contracted further debts: if any of these are due to
british subjects [[subject]], we forbid any countenance or protection whatever to be
given to them, until the debt is fully investigated, the [[nature]] of it
reported [[home]], and our special instructions upon it received.

we cannot conclude this [[subject]] without adverting in the strongest terms
to the prohibitions which have from [[time]] to [[time]] issued under the
authority of different courts of directors against any of our servants,
or of those under our protection, having any [[money]] transactions with any
of the [[country]] powers [[power]], without the [[knowledge]] and previous [[consent]] of our
respective governments [[government]] abroad. we are [[happy]] to find that the nabob,
sensible of the [[great]] embarrassments, both to his own and the company's
affairs, which the enormous amount of their private claims have
occasioned, is willing to engage not to incur any new debts with
individuals, and we [[think]] little difficulty will be found in persuading
his highness into a positive stipulation for that [[purpose]]. and though
the legislature has thus humanely interfered in behalf of such
individuals as might otherwise have been reduced to [[great]] distress by
the [[past]] transactions, we hereby, in the most pointed and positive
terms, repeat our prohibition upon this [[subject]], and direct that no
person, being a servant of the company, or being under our protection,
shall, on any pretence whatever, be concerned in any loan or other money
transaction with any of the [[country]] powers [[power]], unless with the knowledge
and express permission of our respective governments [[government]]. and if any of our
servants, or others, being under our protection, shall be discovered in
any [[respect]] counteracting these orders, we strictly enjoin you to take
the first opportunity of sending them [[home]] to [[england]], to be punished as
guilty of disobedience of orders, and no protection or assistance of the
company shall be given for the recovery of any loans connected with such
transactions. your particular attention to this [[subject]] is strictly
enjoined; and any connivance on your parts to a breach of our orders
upon it will incur our highest displeasure. in order to put an end to
those intrigues which have been so successfully carried on at the
nabob's durbar, we repeat our prohibition in the strongest terms
respecting any intercourse between british subjects [[subject]] and the nabob and
his [[family]]; as we are convinced that such an intercourse has been
carried on greatly to the detriment and expense of the nabob, and merely
to the advantage of individuals [[individual]]. we therefore direct that all persons
who shall offend against the letter and spirit of this necessary order,
whether in the company's service or under their protection, be forthwith
sent to [[england]].

_extract from the representation of the court of directors of the east
india company._

my lords [[lord]] and gentlemen,--

it is with extreme concern that we express a difference of [[opinion]] with
your [[right]] honorable board, in this early exercise of your controlling
power; but in so novel an institution, it can scarce be thought
extraordinary, if the exact boundaries of our respective functions and
duties should not at once, on either side, be precisely and familiarly
understood, and therefore confide in your [[justice]] and candor for
believing that we have no [[wish]] to invade or frustrate the salutary
purposes of your institution, as we on our part are thoroughly satisfied
that you have no [[wish]] to encroach on the legal powers [[power]] of the east india
company. we shall proceed to [[state]] our objections to such of the
amendments as appear to us to be either insufficient, inexpedient, or
unwarranted.

     6th. concerning the private debts of the nabob of arcot, and the
     application of the fund of twelve lacs of pagodas per annum.

under this head you are pleased, in lieu of our paragraphs, to
substantiate at once the [[justice]] of all those demands which the act
requires us to investigate, [[subject]] only to a [[right]] reserved to the
nabob, or any other party concerned, to [[question]] the [[justice]] of any debt
falling within the [[last]] of the three classes. we submit, that at least
the opportunity of questioning, within the limited [[time]], the [[justice]] of
any of the debts, ought to have been fully preserved; and supposing the
first and second classes to stand [[free]] from imputation, (as we incline
to [[believe]] they do,) no injury can result to individuals [[individual]] from such
discussion: and we further submit to your consideration, how far the
express direction of the act to examine the [[nature]] and origin of the
debts has been by the amended paragraphs complied with; and whether at
least the rate of interest, according to which the debts arising from
soucar assignment of the land-revenues to the servants of the company,
acting in the capacity of native bankers, have been accumulated, ought
not to be inquired into, as well as the reasonableness of the deduction
of twenty-five per cent which the bengal [[government]] directed to be made
from a [[great]] part of the debts on [[certain]] conditions. but to your
appropriation of the fund our [[duty]] requires that we should [[state]] our
strongest dissent. our [[right]] to be paid the arrears of those expenses by
which, almost to our own ruin, we have preserved the [[country]] and all
the [[property]] connected with it from falling a prey to a foreign
conqueror, surely stands paramount to all claims for former debts upon
the revenues [[revenue]] of a [[country]] so preserved, even if the legislature had not
expressly limited the assistance to be given the private creditors to be
such as should be consistent with our own rights [[right]]. the nabob had, long
before passing the act, by treaty with our bengal [[government]], agreed to
pay us seven lacs of pagodas, as part of the twelve lacs, in liquidation
of those arrears; of which seven lacs the arrangement you have been
pleased to lay down would take away from us more than the half, and give
it to private creditors, of whose demands there are only about a sixth
part which do not stand in a predicament that you declare would not
entitle them to any aid or protection from us in the recovery thereof,
were it not upon grounds of expediency, as will more particularly appear
by the annexed estimate. until our debt shall be discharged, we can by
no means [[consent]] to give up any part of the seven lacs to the private
creditors; and we humbly apprehend that in this declaration we do not
exceed the limits of the [[authority]] and rights [[right]] vested in us.

the [[right]] honorable the commissioners for the affairs of [[india]].

_the representation of the court of directors of the east india
company_.

my lords [[lord]] and gentlemen,--

the court, having duly attended to your reasonings and decisions on the
subjects of arnee and hanamantagoody, beg leave to observe, with due
deference to your [[judgment]], that the directions we had given in these
paragraphs which did not obtain your approbation still appear to us to
have been consistent with [[justice]], and agreeable to the late act of
parliament, which pointed out to us, as we apprehended, the treaty of
1762 as our guide.

_extract of a letter from the commissioners for the affairs of [[india]], to
the court of directors, dated 3rd november, 1784, in [[answer]] to their
remonstrance_.

sixth article.


we [[think]] it proper, considering the particular [[nature]] of the [[subject]], to
state to you the following remarks on that part of your representation
which relates to the plan for the discharging of the nabob's debts.

1st. you compute the [[revenue]] which the carnatic may be expected to
produce only at twenty lacs of pagodas. if we concurred with you in this
opinion, we should certainly [[feel]] our hopes [[hope]] of advantage to all the
parties from this arrangement considerably diminished. but we trust that
we are not too sanguine on this head, when we place the greatest
reliance on the estimate transmitted to you by your president of fort
st. george, having there the [[best]] means of information upon the [[fact]],
and stating it with a particular view to the [[subject]] matter of these
paragraphs. some allowance, we are sensible, must be made for the
difference of collection in the nabob's hands, but, we trust, not such
as to reduce the receipt nearly to what you suppose.

2ndly. in making up the amount of the private debts, you take in
compound interest at the different rates specified in our paragraph.
this it was not our intention to allow; and lest any misconception
should arise on the spot, we have added an express direction that the
debts be made up with simple interest only, from the [[time]] of their
respective consolidation. clause f f.

3rdly. we have also the strongest grounds to [[believe]] that the debts will
be in other respects [[respect]] considerably less than they are now computed by
you; and consequently, the company's annual proportion of the twelve
lacs will be larger than it appears on your estimate. but even on your
own statement of it, if we add to the 150,000_l._, or 3,75,000 pagodas,
(which you take as the annual proportion to be received by the company
for five years to the end of 1789,) the annual amount of the tanjore
peshcush for the same period, and the arrears on the peshcush, (proposed
by [[lord]] macartney to be received in three years,) the whole will make a
sum not falling very short of pagodas 35,00,000, the amount of pagodas
7,00,000 per annum for the same period. and if we carry our calculations
farther, it will appear, that, both by the plan proposed by the nabob
and adopted in your paragraphs, and by that which we transmitted to you,
the debt from the nabob, if taken at 3,000,000_l._, will be discharged
nearly at the same period, viz., in the course of the eleventh year. we
cannot, therefore, be of [[opinion]] that there is the smallest ground for
objecting to this arrangement, as injurious to the interests of the
company, even if the measure were to be considered on the mere ground
of expediency, and with a view only to the [[wisdom]] of reëstablishing
credit and circulation in a commercial settlement, without any
consideration of those motives of attention to the feelings and [[honor]] of
the nabob, of [[humanity]] to individuals [[individual]], and of [[justice]] to persons [[person]] in your
service and living under your protection, which have actuated the
legislature, and which afford not only justifiable, but commendable
grounds for your conduct.

impressed with this conviction, we have not made any alteration in the
general outlines of the arrangement which we had before transmitted to
you. but, as the amount of the nabob's [[revenue]] is matter of uncertain
conjecture, and as it does not appear just to us that any deficiency
should fall wholly on any one class of these debts, we have added a
direction to your [[government]] of fort st. george, that, if,
notwithstanding the provisions contained in our former paragraphs, any
deficiency should arise, the payments of what shall be received shall be
made in the same proportion which would have obtained in the division of
the whole twelve lacs, had they been paid.

referred to from p. 103.

[the following extracts are subjoined, to show the matter and the style
of representation employed by those who have obtained that ascendency
over the nabob of arcot which is described in the letter marked no. 6 of
the [[present]] appendix, and which is so totally destructive of the
authority and credit of the lawful british [[government]] at madras. the
charges made by these persons [[person]] have been solemnly denied by lord
macartney; and to [[judge]] from the [[character]] of the parties accused and
accusing, they are probably void of all foundation. but as the letters
are in the name and under the signature of a [[person]] of [[great]] rank and
consequence among the natives,--as they contain matter of the most
serious [[nature]],--as they charge the most enormous crimes, and
corruptions of the grossest [[kind]], on a british governor,--and as they
refer to the nabob's minister in [[great]] [[britain]] for proof and further
elucidation of the matters complained of,--common decency and common
policy demanded an inquiry into their [[truth]] or falsehood. the writing is
obviously the product of some english pen. if, on inquiry, these charges
should be made [[good]], (a thing very unlikely,) the party accused would
become a just object of animadversion. if they should be found (as in
all probability they would be found) false and calumnious, and supported
by _forgery_, then the censure would fall on the accuser; at the same
time the necessity would be manifest for proper measures towards the
security of [[government]] against such infamous accusations. it is as
necessary to [[protect]] the honest fame of [[virtuous]] governors as it is to
punish the [[corrupt]] and [[tyrannical]]. but neither the court of directors
nor the board of control have made any inquiry into the [[truth]] or
falsehood of these charges. they have covered over the accusers and
accused with abundance of compliments; they have insinuated some oblique
censures; and they have recommended [[perfect]] harmony between the chargers
of [[corruption]] and peculation and the persons [[person]] charged with these
crimes.]


13th october, 1782. _extract of a translation of a letter from the nabob
of arcot to the chairman of the court of directors of the east india
company_.


fatally for me, and for the [[public]] interest, the company's favor and my
unbounded confidence have been lavished on a [[man]] totally unfit for the
exalted station in which he has been placed, and unworthy of the trusts
that have been reposed in him. when i speak of one who has so deeply
stabbed my [[honor]], my wounds bleed afresh, and i must be allowed that
freedom of expression which the galling reflection of my injuries and my
misfortunes naturally draws from me. shall your servants, unchecked,
unrestrained, and unpunished, gratify their private views and ambition
at the expense of my [[honor]], my [[peace]], and my [[happiness]], and to the ruin
of my [[country]], as well as of all your affairs? no sooner had lord
macartney obtained the favorite object of his [[ambition]] than he betrayed
the [[greatest]] insolence towards me, the most glaring neglect of the
common civilities and attentions paid me by all former governors in the
worst of times [[time]], and even by the most inveterate of my enemies [[enemy]]. he
insulted my servants, endeavored to defame my [[character]] by unjustly
censuring my administration, and extended his boundless usurpation to
the whole [[government]] of my dominions, in all the branches of judicature
and [[police]]; and, in violation of the express articles of the agreements,
proceeded to send renters into the countries [[country]], unapproved of by me, men
of [[bad]] [[character]], and unequal to my management or responsibility.
though he is chargeable with the [[greatest]] acts of [[cruelty]], even to the
shedding the [[blood]] and cutting off the noses and ears of my subjects [[subject]], by
those exercising his [[authority]] in the countries [[country]], and that even the
duties of [[religion]] and [[public]] [[worship]] have been interrupted or
prevented, and though he carries on all his [[business]] by the arbitrary
exertion of [[military]] [[force]], yet does he not collect from the countries
one fourth of the [[revenue]] that should be produced. the statement he
pretends to hold forth of expected [[revenue]] is totally fallacious, and
can never be realized under the management of his lordship, in the
appointment of renters totally disqualified, rapacious, and
irresponsible, who are actually embezzling and dissipating the public
revenues that should assist in the support of the [[war]]. totally occupied
by his private views, and governed by his [[passions]], he has neglected or
sacrificed all the essential objects of [[public]] [[good]], and by want of
coöperation with sir eyre coote, and refusal to furnish the [[army]] with
the necessary supplies, has rendered the glorious and repeated victories
of the gallant general ineffectual to the expulsion of our cruel [[enemy]].
to cover his insufficiency, and veil the discredit attendant on his
failure in every measure, he throws out the most illiberal expressions,
and institutes [[unjust]] accusations against me; and in aggravation of all
the distresses imposed upon me, he has abetted the meanest calumniators
to bring forward false charges against me and my [[son]], amir-ul-omrah, in
order to create embarrassment, and for the distress of my [[mind]]. my
papers and writings sent to you must testify to the whole [[world]] the
malevolence of his designs, and the means that have been used to
forward them. he has violently seized and opened all letters addressed
to me and my servants, on my [[public]] and private affairs. my vackeel,
that attended him according to ancient custom, has been ignominiously
dismissed from his presence, and not [[suffered]] to approach the
government-house. he has in the meanest manner, and as he [[thought]] in
secret, been tampering and intriguing with my [[family]] and relations for
the worst of purposes [[purpose]]. and if i express the agonies of my [[mind]] under
these most pointed injuries and oppressions, and [[complain]] of the
violence and [[injustice]] of [[lord]] macartney, i am insulted by his affected
construction that my communications are dictated by the insinuations of
others, at the same [[time]] that his conscious apprehensions for his
misconduct have produced the most abject applications to me to smother
my feelings, and entreaties to write in his lordship's favor to [[england]],
and to submit all my affairs to his direction. when his submissions have
failed to mould me to his will, he has endeavored to effect his purposes
by menaces of his secret influence with those in [[power]] in [[england]], which
he pretends to assert shall be effectual to confirm his usurpation, and
to deprive me, and my [[family]], in succession, of my rights [[right]] of sovereignty
and [[government]] forever. to such a length have his [[passions]] and violences
carried him, that all my [[family]], my dependants, and even my [[friends]] and
visitors, are persecuted with the strongest marks of his displeasure.
every shadow of [[authority]] in my [[person]] is taken from me, and [[respect]] to
my name discouraged throughout the whole [[country]]. when an officer of
high rank in his majesty's service was some [[time]] since introduced to me
by [[lord]] macartney, his lordship took [[occasion]] to show a personal
derision and contempt of me. mr. richard sulivan, who has attended my
durbar under the commission of the governor-general and council of
bengal, has experienced his resentment; and mr. benfield, _with whom i
have no business_, and who, as he has been accustomed to do for many
years, has continued to [[pay]] me his visits of [[respect]], has [[felt]] the
weight of his lordship's displeasure, and has had every unmerited
insinuation thrown out against him, to prejudice him, and deter him from
paying me his compliments as usual.

thus, gentlemen, have you delivered me over to a stranger; to a man
unacquainted with [[government]] and [[business]], and too opinionated to learn;
to a [[man]] whose ignorance and prejudices operate to the neglect of every
good measure, or the liberal coöperation with any that [[wish]] well to the
public interests; to a [[man]] who, to pursue his own [[passions]], plans, and
designs, will certainly ruin all mine, as well as the company's affairs.
his mismanagement and obstinacy have caused the loss of many lacs of my
revenues, dissipated and embezzled, and every [[public]] consideration
sacrificed to his vanity and private views. i beg to offer an instance
in proof of my assertions, and to justify the [[hope]] i have that you will
cause to be made [[good]] to me all the losses i have sustained by the
maladministration and [[bad]] practices of your servants, according to all
the account of receipts of former years, and which i made known to lord
macartney, amongst other papers of information, in the beginning of his
management in the collections. the district of ongole produced annually,
upon a medium of many years, 90,000 pagodas; but [[lord]] macartney, _upon
receiving a sum of [[money]] from ramchundry_[73] let it out to him, in
april [[last]], for the inadequate rent of 50,000 pagodas per annum,
diminishing, in this district alone, near half the accustomed revenues [[revenue]].
after this manner hath he exercised his powers [[power]] over the countries [[country]], to
suit his own purposes [[purpose]] and designs; and this secret mode has he taken to
reduce the collections.

1st november, 1782. _copy of a letter from the nabob of arcot to the
court of directors, &c._ received 7th april, 1783.

the distresses which i have set forth in my former letters are now
increased to such an alarming pitch by the imprudent measures of your
governor, and by the arbitrary and impolitic conduct pursued with the
merchants and importers of grain, that the very existence of the fort of
madras seems at stake, and that of the inhabitants of the settlement
appears to have been totally overlooked: many thousands have died, and
continue hourly to perish of famine, though the capacity of one of your
youngest servants, with diligence and attention, by doing [[justice]], and
giving reasonable encouragement to the merchants, and by drawing the
supplies of grain which the northern countries [[country]] would have afforded,
might have secured us against all those dreadful calamities. i had with
much difficulty procured and purchased a small quantity of rice, for the
use of myself, my [[family]], and attendants, and with a view of sending off
the [[greatest]] part of the latter to the northern countries [[country]], with a little
subsistence in their hands. but what must your surprise be, when you
learn that even this rice was seized by [[lord]] macartney, with a military
force! and thus am i unable to provide for the few [[people]] i have about
me, who are driven to such extremity and misery that it gives me [[pain]] to
behold them. i have [[desired]] permission to get a little rice from the
northern countries [[country]] for the subsistence of my [[people]], without its being
liable to seizure by your sepoys: this even has been refused me by lord
macartney. what must your feelings be, on such wanton [[cruelty]] exercised
towards me, when you consider, that, of thousands of villages belonging
to me, a [[single]] one would have sufficed for my subsistence!

22d march, 1783. _translation of a letter from the nabob of arcot to the
chairman and directors of the east [[india]] company_. received from mr.
james macpherson, 1st january, 1784.


i am willing to attribute this continued usurpation to the [[fear]] of
detection in [[lord]] macartney: he dreads the awful day when the scene of
his enormities will be laid open, at my restoration to my [[country]], and
when the tongues of my [[oppressed]] subjects [[subject]] will be unloosed, and proclaim
aloud the cruel tyrannies they have sustained. these sentiments of his
lordship's designs are corroborated by his sending, on the 10th instant,
two gentlemen to me and my [[son]], amir-ul-omrah; and these gentlemen from
lord macartney especially set forth to me, and to my [[son]], that all
dependence on the [[power]] of the superior [[government]] of bengal to enforce
the intentions of the company to restore my [[country]] was [[vain]] and
groundless,--that the company confided in his lordship's [[judgment]] and
discretion, and upon his representations, and that if i, and my [[son]],
amir-ul-omrah, would enter into [[friendship]] with [[lord]] macartney, and sign
a paper declaring all my charges and complaints against him to be false,
that his lordship might be induced to write to [[england]] that all his
allegations against me and my [[son]] were not well founded, and,
notwithstanding his declarations to withhold my [[country]], yet, on these
considerations, it might be still restored to me.

what must be your feelings for your ancient and faithful friend, on his
receiving such insults to his [[honor]] and understanding from your
principal servant, armed with your authority! from these manoeuvres,
amongst thousands i have experienced, the [[truth]] must evidently appear to
you, that i have not been loaded with those injuries and oppressions
from motives of [[public]] service, but to [[answer]] the private views and
interests of his lordship and his secret agents: _some papers to this
point are inclosed_; others, almost without number, must be submitted to
your [[justice]], when [[time]] and circumstances shall enable me fully to
investigate those transactions. this opportunity will not permit the
full representation of my load of injuries and distresses: i beg leave
to refer you to my minister, mr. macpherson, for the papers, according
to the inclosed list, which accompanied my [[last]] dispatches by the
rodney, which i [[fear]] have failed; and my correspondence with lord
macartney subsequent to that period, such as i have been able to prepare
for this opportunity, are inclosed.

notwithstanding all the [[violent]] acts and declarations of [[lord]] macartney,
yet a [[consciousness]] of his own misconduct was the sole incentive to the
menaces and overtures he has held out in various shapes. he has been
insultingly lavish in his expressions of high [[respect]] for my [[person]];
has had the insolence to say that all his measures flowed from his
affectionate regard alone; has presumed to say that all his enmity and
oppression were levelled at my [[son]], amir-ul-omrah, to whom he before
acknowledged every aid and assistance; and his lordship being without
any just cause or foundation for complaint against us, or a veil to
cover his own violences, he has now had recourse to the meanness and has
dared to intimate of my [[son]], in order to intimidate me and to strengthen
his own wicked purposes [[purpose]], to be in league with our enemies [[enemy]] the french.
you must doubtless be astonished, no less at the assurance than at the
absurdity of such a wicked suggestion.

       *       *       *       *       *

in the nabob's own hand.

p.s. in my own handwriting i acquainted mr. hastings, as i now do my
ancient [[friends]] the company, with the insult offered to my [[honor]] and
understanding, in the extraordinary propositions sent to me by lord
macartney, through two gentlemen, on the 10th instant, so artfully
veiled with menaces, hopes [[hope]], and promises. but how can [[lord]] macartney add
to his enormities, after his wicked and calumniating insinuations, so
evidently directed against me and my [[family]], through my faithful, my
dutiful, and beloved [[son]], amir-ul-omrah, who, you well [[know]], has been
ever born and bred amongst the english, whom i have studiously brought
up in the warmest sentiments of affection and attachment to
them,--sentiments that in his maturity have been his highest [[ambition]] to
improve, insomuch that he knows [[know]] no [[happiness]] but in the faithful support
of our [[alliance]] and connection with the english nation?

     of a letter to the chairman and directors of the east india
     company._ received from mr. james macpherson, 14th january, 1784.

your astonishment and indignation will be equally raised with mine, when
you hear that your president _has dared_, contrary to your intention, to
continue to usurp the privileges [[privilege]] and hereditary powers [[power]] of the nabob of
the carnatic, your old and unshaken friend, and the declared ally of the
king of [[great]] [[britain]].

i will not take up your [[time]] by enumerating the particular acts of lord
macartney's [[violence]], [[cruelty]], and [[injustice]]: _they, indeed, occur too
frequently, and fall upon me and my devoted subjects [[subject]] and [[country]] too
thick, to be regularly related_. i refer you to my minister, mr. james
macpherson, _for a more circumstantial account of the oppressions and
enormities by which he has brought both mine_ and the company's affairs
to the brink of destruction. i trust that such flagrant violations of
all [[justice]], [[honor]], and the [[faith]] of treaties will receive the severest
marks of your displeasure, and that [[lord]] macartney's conduct, in making
use of your name and [[authority]] as a sanction for the continuance of his
usurpation, will be disclaimed with the utmost indignation, and followed
with the severest [[punishment]]. i conceive that his lordship's arbitrary
retention of my [[country]] and [[government]] can only originate in his
_insatiable cravings_, in his implacable malevolence against me, and
through [[fear]] of detection, which must [[follow]] the [[surrender]] of the
carnatic into my hands, of those nefarious proceedings which are now
suppressed by the arm of [[violence]] and [[power]].

i did not fail to represent to the supreme [[government]] of bengal the
deplorable situation to which i was reduced, and the unmerited
persecutions i have unremittingly sustained from [[lord]] macartney; and i
earnestly implored them to stretch forth a saving arm, and interpose
that controlling [[power]] which was vested in them, to check _rapacity and
presumption_, and preserve the [[honor]] and [[faith]] of the company from
violation. the governor-general and council not only [[felt]] the cruelty
and [[injustice]] i had [[suffered]], but were greatly alarmed for the fatal
consequences that might result from the distrust of the [[country]] powers
in the professions of the english, when they saw the nabob of the
carnatic, the friend of the company, and the ally of [[great]] [[britain]], thus
stripped of his rights [[right]], his dominions, and his [[dignity]], by the most
fraudulent means, and under the mask of [[friendship]]. the bengal
government had already heard both the mahrattas and the nizam urge, as
an objection to an [[alliance]] with the english, the faithless behavior of
lord macartney to a [[prince]] whose [[life]] had been devoted and whose
treasures had been exhausted in their service and support; and they did
not hesitate to give positive orders to [[lord]] macartney for the
restitution of my [[government]] and [[authority]], on such terms as were not
only strictly honorable, but equally advantageous to my [[friends]] the
company: for they justly [[thought]] that my [[honor]] and [[dignity]] and
_sovereign rights_ were the first objects of my wishes [[wish]] and [[ambition]]. but
how can i paint my astonishment at [[lord]] macartney's presumption in
continuing his usurpation after their positive and reiterated mandates,
and, as if nettled by their interference, which he disdained, in
redoubling the fury of his [[violence]], and sacrificing the [[public]] and
myself to his malice and ungovernable [[passions]]?

i am, gentlemen, at a loss to conceive where his usurpation will stop
and have an end. has he not solemnly declared that the assignment was
only made for the support of [[war]]? and if neither your instructions nor
the orders of his superiors at bengal were to be considered as
effectual, has not the treaty of [[peace]] virtually determined the period
of his [[tyrannical]] administration? but so far from surrendering the
carnatic into my hands, he has, since that event, affixed advertisements
to the walls and gates of the black town for letting to the [[best]] bidder
the various districts for the term of three years,--and has continued
the committee of [[revenue]], which you positively ordered to be abolished,
to whom he has allowed enormous salaries, from 6000 to 4000 pagodas per
annum, which each member has received from the [[time]] of his appointment,
though his lordship well knows [[know]] that most of them are by your orders
disqualified by being my principal creditors.

if those acts of [[violence]] and outrage had been productive of public
advantage, i conceive his lordship might have held them forward in
extenuation of his conduct; but whilst he cloaks his justification under
the veil of your records, it is impossible to refute his assertions or
to expose to you their fallacy; and when he is no longer able to support
his conduct by argument, he refers to those records, where, i
understand, he has exercised all his sophistry and malicious
insinuations to render me and my [[family]] obnoxious in the [[eyes]] of the
company and the british nation. and when the glorious victories [[victory]] of sir
eyre coote have been rendered abortive by a constant deficiency of
supplies,--and when, since the departure of that excellent general to
bengal, whose loss i must ever regret, a dreadful famine, at the close
of [[last]] year, occasioned by his lordship's neglect to lay up a
sufficient stock of grain at a proper season, and from his prohibitory
orders to private merchants,--and when no exertion has been made, nor
advantage gained over the [[enemy]],--when hyder's [[death]] and tippoo's return
to his own dominions operated in no [[degree]] for the benefit of our
affairs,--in short, when all has been a continued series of
disappointment and disgrace under [[lord]] macartney's management, (and in
him alone has the management been vested,)--i want words to convey those
ideas of his insufficiency, ignorance, and obstinacy which i am
convinced you would entertain, had you been spectators of his ruinous
and destructive conduct.

but against me, and my [[son]], amir-ul-omrah, has his lordship's vengeance
chiefly been exerted: even the company's own subordinate zemindars have
found [[better]] treatment, probably because they were more [[rich]]; those of
nizanagoram have been permitted, contrary to your pointed orders, to
hold their [[rich]] zemindaries at the old disproportionate rate of little
more than a sixth part of the real [[revenue]]; and my zemindar of tanjore,
though he should have regarded himself equally concerned with us in the
event of the [[war]], and from whose fertile [[country]] many valuable harvests
have been gathered in, which have sold at a vast price, has, i
understand, only contributed, [[last]] year, towards the [[public]] exigencies,
the very inconsiderable sum of one lac of pagodas, and a few thousand
pagodas' worth of grain.

i am much concerned to acquaint you that ever since the [[peace]] a dreadful
famine has swept away many thousands of the followers and sepoys'
families of the [[army]], from [[lord]] macartney's neglect to send down grain
to the camp, though the roads are crowded with vessels: but his lordship
has been too intent upon his own disgraceful schemes to attend to the
wants of the [[army]]. the negotiation with tippoo, which he has set on foot
through the mediation of monsieur bussy, has employed all his thoughts [[thought]],
and to the attainment of that object he will [[sacrifice]] the dearest
interests of the company to gratify his malevolence against me, and for
his own private advantages. the endeavor to treat with tippoo, through
the means of the french, must strike you, gentlemen, as highly improper
and impolitic; but it must raise your utmost indignation to hear, that,
by intercepted letters from bussy to tippoo, as well as from their
respective vakeels, and from various accounts from cuddalore, we have
every [[reason]] to conclude that his lordship's secretary, mr. staunton,
when at cuddalore, as his agent to settle the cessation of arms with the
french, was informed of all their operations and projects, and
_consequently that [[lord]] macartney has secretly connived at monsieur
bussy's recommendation to tippoo to return into the carnatic, as the
means of procuring the most advantageous terms, and furnishing lord
macartney with the plea of necessity for concluding a [[peace]] after his
own manner_: and what further confirms the [[truth]] of this [[fact]] is, that
repeated reports, as well as the alarms of the inhabitants to the
westward, leave us no [[reason]] to [[doubt]] that tippoo is approaching
towards us. his lordship has issued [[public]] orders that the garrison
store of rice, for which we are indebted to the exertions of the bengal
government, should be immediately disposed of, and has strictly forbid
all private grain to be sold; by which act he effectually prohibits all
private importation of grain, and may eventually cause as horrid a
famine as that which we experienced at the close of [[last]] year from the
same shortsighted policy and destructive prohibitions of [[lord]] macartney.

but as he has the fabrication of the records in his own hands, he trusts
to those partial representations of his [[character]] and conduct, because
the signatures of those members of [[government]] whom he seldom consults
are affixed, as a [[public]] sanction; but you may form a just [[idea]] of their
correctness and propriety, when you are informed that his lordship,
_upon my noticing the heavy disbursements made for secret service [[money]],
ordered the sums to be struck off, and the accounts to be erased from
the cash-book of the company_; and i [[think]] i cannot give you a better
proof of his management of my [[country]] and revenues [[revenue]] than by calling your
attention to his conduct in the ongole province, and by referring you to
his lordship's administration of your own jaghire, from whence he has
brought to the [[public]] account the sum of twelve hundred pagodas for the
last year's [[revenue]], yet blazons forth his vast merits [[merit]] and exertions,
and expects to receive the thanks of his committee and council.

i will beg leave to refer you to my minister, james macpherson, esq.,
for a more particular account of my sufferings and miseries, to whom i
have transmitted copies of all papers that passed with his lordship.

i cannot conclude without calling your attention to _the situation of my
different creditors_, whose claims are the claims of [[justice]], and whose
demands i am bound by [[honor]] and every [[moral]] obligation to discharge; it
is not, therefore, without [[great]] concern i have heard insinuations
tending to [[question]] the legality of their [[right]] to the payment of those
just debts: they proceeded from advances made by them openly and
honorably for the support of my own and the [[public]] affairs. but i hope
the tongue of calumny will never drown the voice of [[truth]] and [[justice]];
and while that is heard, the [[wisdom]] of the english nation cannot fail to
accede to an effectual remedy for their distresses, by any arrangement
in which their claims may be duly considered and equitably provided for:
and for this [[purpose]], my minister, _mr. macpherson, will readily
subscribe, in my name, to any agreement you may [[think]] proper to adopt,
founded on the same principles_ with either of the engagements i entered
into with the supreme [[government]] of bengal for our mutual interest and
advantage.

i always [[pray]] for your [[happiness]] and [[prosperity]].

     6th september, and postscript of 7th september, 1783. _translation
     of a letter from the nabob of arcot to the chairman and directors
     of the east [[india]] company._ received from mr. james macpherson,
     14th january, 1784.

i refer you, gentlemen, to my inclosed duplicate, as well as to my
minister, mr. macpherson, for the particulars of my sufferings. there is
no word or action of mine that is not perverted; and though it was my
intention to have sent my [[son]], amir-ul-omrah, who is well versed in my
affairs, to bengal, to impress those gentlemen with a full sense of my
situation, yet i find myself obliged to lay it aside, from the
insinuations of the calumniating tongue of [[lord]] macartney, that takes
every license to traduce every action of my [[life]] and that of my [[son]]. i
am informed that [[lord]] macartney, at this late moment, intends to write a
letter: i am ignorant of the [[subject]], but fully perceive, that, by
delaying to send it till the very eve of the dispatch, he means to
deprive me of all possibility of communicating my reply, and forwarding
it for the information of my [[friends]] in [[england]]. conscious of the weak
ground on which he stands, he is obliged to have recourse to these
artifices to mislead the [[judgment]], and support for a [[time]] his
unjustifiable measures by deceit and imposition. i [[wish]] only to meet and
combat his charges and allegations fairly and openly, and i have
repeatedly and urgently demanded to be furnished with copies of those
parts of his _fabricated_ records relative to myself; but as he well
knows i should refute his sophistry, i cannot be surprised at his
refusal, though i lament that it prevents you, gentlemen, from a clear
investigation of his conduct towards me.

inclosed you have a translation of an arzee from the killidar of
vellore. _i have thousands of the same kind_; but this, just now
received, will serve to give you some [[idea]] of the miseries brought upon
this my devoted [[country]], and the wretched inhabitants that remain in it,
by the oppressive hand of [[lord]] macartney's management: nor will the
_embezzlements of collections_ thus obtained, when brought before you in
_proof_, appear less extraordinary,--which _shall certainly be done in
due time_.

     _translation of an arzee, in the persian [[language]], from
     uzzim-ul-doen cawn, the killidar of vellore, to the nabob_, dated
     1st september, 1783. inclosed in the nabob's letter to the court of
     directors, september, 1783.

i have repeatedly represented to your highness the violences and
oppressions exercised by the [[present]] aumildar [collector of revenue], of
lord macartney's appointment, over the few remaining inhabitants of the
districts of vellore, amboor, saulguda, &c.

the outrages and violences now committed are of that astonishing nature
as were never known or heard of during the administration of the circar.
hyder naik, the cruellest of tyrants [[tyrant]], used every [[kind]] of oppression in
the circar countries [[country]]; but even his measures were not like those now
pursued. such of the inhabitants as had escaped the [[sword]] and pillage of
hyder naik, by taking refuge in the woods, and within the walls of
vellore, &c., on the arrival of [[lord]] macartney's aumildar to vellore,
and in consequence of his cowle of protection and support, most
cheerfully returned to the villages, set about the cultivation of the
lands, and with [[great]] pains [[pain]] rebuilt their cottages.--but now the
aumildar has imprisoned the wives [[wife]] and [[children]] of the inhabitants,
seized the few jewels that were on the bodies [[body]] of the [[women]], and then,
before the faces of their husbands, flogged them, in order to make them
produce other jewels and effects, which he said they had buried
somewhere under ground, and to make the inhabitants bring him [[money]],
notwithstanding there was yet no cultivation in the [[country]]. terrified
with the flagellations, some of them produced their jewels and
wearing-apparel of their [[women]], to the amount of ten or fifteen pagodas,
which they had hidden; others, who declared they had none, the aumildar
flogged their [[women]] severely, tied cords around their breasts, and tore
the sucking [[children]] from their teats, and exposed them to the scorching
heat of the sun. those [[children]] died, as did the [[wife]] of ramsoamy, an
inhabitant of bringpoor. even this could not stir up compassion in the
breast of the aumildar. some of the [[children]] that were somewhat large he
exposed to sale. in short, the violences of the aumildar are so
astonishing, that the [[people]], on seeing the [[present]] situation, remember
the loss of hyder with regret. with whomsoever the aumildar finds a
single measure of natchinee or rice, he takes it away from him, and
appropriates it to the expenses of the sibindy that he keeps up. no
revenues are collected from the countries [[country]], but from the effects of the
poor, wretched inhabitants. those ryots [yeomen] who intended to return
to their habitations, hearing of those violences, have fled for refuge,
with their wives [[wife]] and [[children]], into hyder's [[country]]. every day is
ushered in and closed with these violences and disturbances. i have no
power to do anything; and who will hear what i have to say? my business
is to inform your highness, who are my master. the [[people]] bring their
complaints to me, and i tell them i will write to your highness.[74]

     _translation of a tellinga letter from veira permaul, head dubash
     to [[lord]] macartney, in his own handwriting, to rajah ramchunda, the
     renter of ongole._ dated 25th of the hindoo month mausay, in the
     year plavanamal, corresponding to 5th march, 1782.

i [[present]] my respects [[respect]] to you, and am very well here, wishing to hear
frequently of your welfare.

your peasher vancatroyloo has brought the visseel bakees, and delivered
them to me, as _also what you sent him for me to deliver to my master,
which i have done. my master at first refused to take it, because he is
unacquainted with your disposition_, or what [[kind]] of a [[person]] you are.
but after i made encomiums on your goodness and greatness of [[mind]], and
took my oath to the same, and that _it would not become public_, but be
held as precious as our lives [[life]], _my master accepted it_. you may remain
satisfied that i will get the ongole [[business]] settled in your name; i
will cause the jamaubundee to be settled agreeable to your [[desire]]. it
was formerly the nabob's intention to give this [[business]] to you, as the
governor knows [[know]] full well, but did not at that [[time]] agree to it, which
you must be well acquainted with.

your peasher vancatroyloo is a very careful, [[good]] [[man]]; he is well
experienced in [[business]]; _he has bound me by an oath to keep all this
business secret, and that his own, yours, and my lives [[life]] are responsible
for it_. i write this letter to you with the [[greatest]] reluctance, and i
signified the same to your peasher, and declared that i would not write
to you by any means. to this the peasher urged, that, _if i did not
write to his master, how could he [[know]] to whom he (the peasher)
delivered the money_, and what must his master [[think]] of it? therefore i
write you this letter, and send it by my servant ramanah, accompanied by
the peasher's servant, and it will come safe to your hands. after
perusal, you will send it back to me immediately: until i receive it, i
don't like to [[eat]] my victuals or take any sleep. your peasher took his
oath, and urged me to write this for your satisfaction, and has engaged
to me that i shall have this letter returned to me in the space of
twelve days.

the [[present]] governor is not like the former governors: he is a very
great [[man]] in [[europe]]; and all the [[great]] [[men]] of [[europe]] are much obliged,
to him for his condescension in accepting the [[government]] of this place.
it is his custom, when he makes [[friendship]] with any one, to continue it
always; and if _he is at enmity with any one, he never will desist till
he has worked his destruction. he is now exceedingly displeased with
the nabob, and you will [[understand]] by-and-by that the nabob's business
cannot be carried on_; he (the nabob) will have no [[power]] to do anything
in his own affairs: _you have, therefore, no room to [[fear]] him_; you may
remain with a contented [[mind]]. i [[desired]] the governor to write you a
letter for your satisfaction: the governor said he would do so, when the
business was settled. this letter you must peruse as soon as possible,
and send it back with all speed by the bearer, ramadoo, accompanied by
three or four of your [[people]], to the end that no accident may happen on
the road. these [[people]] must be ordered to march in the night only, and
to arrive here with the [[greatest]] dispatch. you sent ten mangoes for my
master and two for me, all of which i have delivered to my master,
thinking that ten was not sufficient to [[present]] him with. i write this
for your information, and salute you with ten thousand respects [[respect]].

     i, muttu kistnah, of madras patnam, dubash, declare that i
     perfectly [[understand]] the gentoo [[language]], and do most solemnly
     affirm that the foregoing is a true translation of the annexed
     paper writing from the gentoo [[language]].

     (signed)

     muttu kistnah.

footnotes:

[68] in this statement, the ongole [[country]], though it is included under
the head of gross [[revenue]], has been let for a [[certain]] sum, exclusive of
charges. if the expenses specified in the nabob's vassool accounts for
this district are added, the [[present]] gross [[revenue]] even would appear to
exceed the nabob's; and as the [[country]] is only let for one year, there
may hereafter be an increase of its [[revenue]].

[69] the trichinopoly countries [[country]] let for the above sum, exclusive of the
expenses of sibbendy and saderwared, amounting, by the nabob's accounts,
to rupees 1,30,00 per annum, which are to be defrayed by the renter. and
the jaghires of amir-ul-omrah and the begum are not included in the
present lease.

[70] for the ground of this "great reliance," see the papers in this
appendix, no. 5; as also the nabob's letters to the court of directors
in this appendix, no. 10.

[71] for the full proof of this necessity, [[lord]] macartney's whole
correspondence on the [[subject]] may be referred to. without the act here
condemned, not one of the acts commended in the preceding paragraph
could be performed. by referring to the nabob's letters in this appendix
it will be seen what sort of task a governor has on his hands, who is to
use, according to the direction of this letter, "acts of address,
civility, and conciliation," and to [[pay]], upon _all_ occasions [[occasion]], _the
highest attention_, to persons [[person]] who at the very [[time]] are falsely, and in
the grossest terms, accusing him of peculation, [[corruption]], [[treason]], and
every [[species]] of malversation in office. the recommendation, under
menaces of such behavior, and under such circumstances, conveys a lesson
the tendency of which cannot be misunderstood.

[72] the delicacy here recommended, in the _expressions_ concerning
conduct "with which the safety of our settlements is essentially
connected," is a lesson of the same [[nature]] with the former. dangerous
designs, if truly such, ought to be expressed according to their nature
and qualities. and as for the _secrecy_ recommended concerning the
designs here alluded to, nothing can be more absurd; as they appear very
fully and directly in the papers published by the [[authority]] of the court
of directors in 1775, and may be easily discerned from the propositions
for the bengal treaty, published in the reports of the committee of
secrecy, and in the reports of the select committee. the keeping of such
secrets too long has been one cause of the carnatic [[war]], and of the ruin
of our affairs in [[india]].

[73] see tellinga letter, at the end of this correspondence.

[74] the above-recited practices, or practices similar to them, have
prevailed in almost every part of the miserable countries [[country]] on the coast
of coromandel for near twenty years [[past]]. that they prevailed as
strongly and generally as they could prevail, under the administration
of the nabob, there can be no [[question]], notwithstanding the assertion in
the beginning of the above petition; nor will it ever be otherwise,
whilst affairs are conducted upon the principles [[principle]] which influence the
present [[system]]. whether the particulars here asserted are true or false
neither the court of directors nor their ministry have [[thought]] proper to
inquire. if they are true, in order to bring them to affect lord
macartney, it ought to be proved that the complaint was made _to him,
and that he had refused redress_. instead of this [[fair]] course, the
complaint is carried to the court of directors.--the above is one of the
documents transmitted by the nabob, in proof of his charge of corruption
against [[lord]] macartney. if [[genuine]], it is conclusive, at least against
lord macartney's principal agent and manager. if it be a forgery, (as in
all likelihood it is,) it is conclusive against the nabob and his evil
counsellors, and folly demonstrates, if anything further were necessary
to demonstrate, the necessity of the clause in mr. fox's bill
prohibiting the residence of the native princes [[prince]] in the company's
principal settlements,--which clause was, for obvious reasons [[reason]], not
admitted into mr. pitt's. it shows, too, the absolute necessity of a
severe and exemplary [[punishment]] on [[certain]] of his english evil
counsellors and creditors, by whom such practices are carried on.




substance of the speech

in the

debate on the [[army]] estimates

in the house of commons [[common]],

on tuesday, february 9, 1790

comprehending

a discussion of the [[present]] situation of affairs in [[france]].




speech.

mr. burke's [[speech]] on the report of the [[army]] estimates has not been
correctly stated in some of the [[public]] papers. it is of consequence to
him not to be misunderstood. the matter which incidentally came into
discussion is of the most serious importance. it is [[thought]] that the
heads and substance of the [[speech]] will [[answer]] the [[purpose]] sufficiently.
if, in making the abstract, through defect of memory in the [[person]] who
now gives it, any difference at all should be perceived from the speech
as it was spoken, it will not, the editor imagines, be found in anything
which may amount to a retraction of the opinions [[opinion]] he then maintained, or
to any softening in the expressions in which they were conveyed.

mr. burke spoke a considerable [[time]] in [[answer]] to various arguments,
which had been insisted upon by mr. grenville and mr. pitt, for keeping
an increased [[peace]] establishment, and against an improper [[jealousy]] of
the ministers, in whom a full confidence, [[subject]] to responsibility,
ought to be placed, on account of their [[knowledge]] of the real situation
of affairs, the exact [[state]] of which it frequently happened that they
could not disclose without violating the constitutional and political
secrecy necessary to the well-being of their [[country]].

mr. burke said in substance, that confidence might become a [[vice]], and
jealousy a [[virtue]], according to circumstances. that confidence, of all
public virtues [[virtue]], was the most dangerous, and [[jealousy]] in an house of
commons, of all [[public]] vices [[vice]], the most tolerable,--- especially where
the number and the charge of standing armies [[army]] in [[time]] of [[peace]] was the
question.

that in the annual mutiny bill the annual [[army]] was declared to be for
the [[purpose]] of preserving the balance of [[power]] in [[europe]]. the propriety
of its being larger or smaller depended, therefore, upon the true state
of that balance. if the increase of [[peace]] establishments demanded of
parliament agreed with the manifest appearance of the balance,
confidence in ministers as to the particulars would be very proper. if
the increase was not at all supported by any such appearance, he thought
great [[jealousy]] might be, and ought to be, entertained on that [[subject]].

that he did not find, on a review of all [[europe]], that, politically, we
stood in the smallest [[degree]] of danger from any one [[state]] or [[kingdom]] it
contained, nor that any other [[foreign]] powers [[power]] than our own allies were
likely to obtain a considerable preponderance in the scale.

that [[france]] had hitherto been our first object in all considerations
concerning the balance of [[power]]. the presence or absence of france
totally varied every sort of speculation relative to that balance.

that [[france]] is at this [[time]], in a [[political]] [[light]], to be considered as
expunged out of the [[system]] of [[europe]]. whether she could ever appear in
it again, as a leading [[power]], was not easy to determine; but at present
be considered [[france]] as not politically existing; and most assuredly it
would take up much [[time]] to restore her to her former active existence:
_gallos quoque in bellis floruisse audivimus_ might possibly be the
language of the rising [[generation]]. he did not mean to deny that it was
our [[duty]] to keep our eye on that nation, and to regulate our preparation
by the symptoms of her recovery.

that it was to her _strength_, not to her _form of government_, which we
were to attend; because republics [[republic]], as well as monarchies [[monarchy]], were
susceptible of [[ambition]], [[jealousy]], and anger, the usual causes of [[war]].

but if, while [[france]] continued in this swoon, we should go on increasing
our expenses, we should certainly make ourselves less a match for her
when it became our concern to arm.

it was said, that, as she had speedily fallen, she might speedily rise
again. he doubted this. that the fall from an height was with an
accelerated velocity; but to lift a weight up to that height again was
difficult, and opposed by the laws [[law]] of physical and political
gravitation.

in a [[political]] view, [[france]] was low indeed. she had lost everything,
even to her name.

        jacet ingens littore truncus,
    avolsumque humeris _caput_, et sine _nomine_ corpus.[75]

he was astonished at it; he was alarmed at it; he trembled at the
uncertainty of all [[human]] greatness.

since the house had been prorogued in the summer much [[work]] was done in
france. the french had shown themselves the ablest architects of ruin
that had hitherto existed in the [[world]]. in that very short space of time
they had completely pulled down to the ground their [[monarchy]], their
church, their nobility, their [[law]], their [[revenue]], their [[army]], their
navy, their commerce, their [[arts]], and their manufactures. they had done
their [[business]] for us as rivals in a way in which twenty ramillies or
blenheims could never have done it. were we absolute conquerors, and
france to [[lie]] prostrate at our feet, we should be ashamed to send a
commission to settle their affairs which could impose so hard a [[law]] upon
the french, and so destructive of all their consequence as a nation, as
that they had imposed upon themselves.

france, by the mere circumstance of its vicinity, had been, and in a
degree always must be, an object of our vigilance, either with regard to
her actual [[power]] or to her influence and [[example]]. as to the former he
had spoken; as to the latter (her example) he should say a few words:
for by this [[example]] our [[friendship]] and our intercourse with that nation
had once been, and might again become, more dangerous to us than their
worst hostility.

in the [[last]] century, louis the fourteenth had established a greater and
better disciplined [[military]] [[force]] than ever had been before seen in
europe, and with it a [[perfect]] despotism. though that despotism was
proudly arrayed in manners, gallantry, splendor, magnificence, and even
covered over with the imposing robes of [[science]], literature, and [[arts]],
it was, in [[government]], nothing [[better]] than a painted and gilded
tyranny,--in [[religion]], a hard, stern intolerance, the fit companion and
auxiliary to the despotic [[tyranny]] which prevailed in its [[government]]. the
same [[character]] of despotism insinuated itself into every court of
europe,--the same spirit of disproportioned magnificence,--the same love
of standing armies [[army]], above the ability of the [[people]]. in particular, our
then sovereigns [[sovereign]], [[king]] charles and [[king]] james, fell in [[love]] with the
government of their neighbor, so flattering to the [[pride]] of kings [[king]]. a
similarity of sentiments brought on connections equally dangerous to the
interests and liberties [[liberty]] of their [[country]]. it were well that the
infection had gone no farther than the [[throne]]. the admiration of a
government flourishing and successful, unchecked in its operations, and
seeming, therefore, to compass its objects more speedily and
effectually, gained something upon all ranks of [[people]]. the good
patriots of that day, however, struggled against it. they sought nothing
more anxiously than to break off all communication with [[france]], and to
beget a total alienation from its councils and its [[example]],--which, by
the animosity prevalent between the abettors of their [[religious]] system
and the assertors of ours, was in some [[degree]] effected.

this day the [[evil]] is totally changed in [[france]]: but there is an evil
there. the disease is altered; but the vicinity of the two countries
remains, and must remain; and the [[natural]] mental habits of [[mankind]] are
such, that the [[present]] distemper of [[france]] is far more likely to be
contagious than the old one: for it is not quite easy to spread a
passion for servitude among the [[people]]; but in all evils [[evil]] of the opposite
kind our [[natural]] inclinations are flattered. in the case of despotism,
there is the _fœdum crimen servitutis_: in the [[last]], the _falsa species
libertatis_; and accordingly, as the historian says, _pronis auribus
accipitur_.

in the [[last]] [[age]] we were in danger of being entangled by the [[example]] of
france in the net of a relentless despotism. it is not necessary to say
anything upon that [[example]]. it exists no longer. our [[present]] danger from
the [[example]] of a [[people]] whose [[character]] knows [[know]] no medium is, with regard
to [[government]], a danger from [[anarchy]]: a danger of being [[led]], through an
admiration of successful fraud and [[violence]], to an imitation of the
excesses of an irrational, unprincipled, proscribing, confiscating,
plundering, ferocious, bloody, and [[tyrannical]] [[democracy]]. on the side of
religion, the danger of their [[example]] is no longer from intolerance, but
from atheism: a foul, unnatural [[vice]], foe to all the [[dignity]] and
consolation of [[mankind]]; which seems in [[france]], for a long [[time]], to have
been embodied into a faction, accredited, and almost avowed.

these are our [[present]] dangers from [[france]]. but, in his [[opinion]], the very
worst part of the [[example]] set is in the late assumption of citizenship
by the [[army]], and the whole of the arrangement, or rather disarrangement,
of their [[military]].

he was [[sorry]] that his [[right]] honorable friend (mr. fox) had dropped even
a word expressive of exultation on that circumstance, or that he seemed
of [[opinion]] that the objection from standing armies [[army]] was at all lessened
by it. he attributed this [[opinion]] of mr. fox entirely to his known zeal
for the [[best]] of all causes, [[liberty]]. that it was with a pain
inexpressible he was obliged to have even the shadow of a difference
with his friend, whose [[authority]] would always be [[great]] with him, and
with all thinking [[people]],--_quæ maxima semper censetur nobis, et_ erit
_quæ maxima semper_;--his confidence in mr. fox was such, and so ample,
as to be almost implicit. that he was not ashamed to avow that [[degree]] of
docility. that, when the [[choice]] is well made, it strengthens, instead of
oppressing our [[intellect]]. that he who calls in the aid of an equal
understanding doubles his own. he who profits [[profit]] of a superior
understanding raises his powers [[power]] to a level with the height of the
superior understanding he unites with. he had found the benefit of such
a junction, and would not lightly depart from it. he wished almost, on
all occasions [[occasion]], that his sentiments were understood to be conveyed in mr.
fox's words. and that he wished, as amongst the [[greatest]] benefits he
could [[wish]] the [[country]], an eminent share of [[power]] to that right
honorable gentleman; because he knew that to his [[great]] and masterly
understanding he had joined the [[greatest]] possible [[degree]] of that natural
moderation which is the [[best]] corrective of [[power]]: that he was of the
most artless, candid, open, and benevolent disposition; disinterested in
the extreme; of a temper mild and placable even to a [[fault]]; without one
drop of gall in his whole [[constitution]].

that the house must perceive, from his coming forward to mark an
expression or two of his [[best]] friend, how anxious he was to keep the
distemper of [[france]] from the least countenance in [[england]], where he was
sure some wicked persons [[person]] had shown a [[strong]] disposition to recommend an
imitation of the french spirit of reform. he was so strongly opposed to
any the least tendency towards the _means_ of introducing a democracy
like theirs, as well as to the _end_ itself, that, much as it would
afflict him, if such a thing could be attempted, and that any friend of
his could concur in such measures, (he was far, very far, from believing
they could,) he would abandon his [[best]] [[friends]], and join with his worst
enemies, to oppose either the means or the end,--and to resist all
violent exertions of the spirit of innovation, so distant from all
principles of true and safe reformation: a spirit well calculated to
overturn states, but perfectly unfit to amend them.

that he was no [[enemy]] to reformation. almost every [[business]] in which he
was much concerned, from the first day he sat in that house to that
hour, was a [[business]] of reformation; and when he had not been employed
in correcting, he had been employed in resisting abuses [[abuse]]. some traces of
this spirit in him now stand on their statute-book. in his [[opinion]],
anything which unnecessarily tore to pieces the contexture of the state
not only prevented all real reformation, but introduced evils [[evil]] which
would call, but perhaps call in [[vain]], for new reformation.

that he [[thought]] the french nation very unwise. what they valued
themselves on was a disgrace to them. they had gloried (and some people
in [[england]] had [[thought]] fit to take share in that glory) in making a
revolution, as if revolutions [[revolution]] were [[good]] things in themselves. all the
horrors and all the crimes of the [[anarchy]] which [[led]] to their [[revolution]],
which attend its [[progress]], and which may virtually attend it in its
establishment, pass for nothing with the lovers of revolutions [[revolution]]. the
french have made their way, through the destruction of their [[country]], to
a [[bad]] [[constitution]], when they were absolutely in possession of a good
one. they were in possession of it the day the states met in separate
orders. their [[business]], had they been either [[virtuous]] or [[wise]], or had
been left to their own [[judgment]], was to secure the stability and
independence of the states, according to those orders, under the monarch
on the [[throne]]. it was then their [[duty]] to redress grievances.

instead of redressing grievances, and improving the fabric of their
state, to which they were called by their monarch and sent by their
country, they were made to take a very different course. they first
destroyed all the balances and counterpoises which serve to fix the
state and to give it a steady direction, and which furnish sure
correctives to any [[violent]] spirit which may prevail in any of the
orders. these balances existed in their oldest [[constitution]], and in the
constitution of this [[country]], and in the [[constitution]] of all the
countries in [[europe]]. these they rashly destroyed, and then they melted
down the whole into one incongruous, ill-connected mass.

when they had done this, they instantly, and with the most atrocious
perfidy and breach of all [[faith]] among [[men]], laid the axe to the root of
all [[property]], and consequently of all national [[prosperity]], by the
principles they established and the [[example]] they set, in confiscating
all the possessions of the [[church]]. they made and recorded a sort of
_institute_ and _digest_ of [[anarchy]], called the rights [[right]] of [[man]], in such a
pedantic [[abuse]] of elementary principles [[principle]] as would have disgraced boys at
school: but this declaration of rights [[right]] was worse than trifling and
pedantic in them; as by their name and [[authority]] they systematically
destroyed every hold of [[authority]] by [[opinion]], [[religious]] or civil, on the
minds of the [[people]]. by this mad declaration they subverted the [[state]],
and brought on such calamities as no [[country]], without a long [[war]], has
ever been known to suffer, and which may in the end [[produce]] such a [[war]],
and perhaps many such.

with them the [[question]] was not between despotism and [[liberty]]. the
sacrifice they made of the [[peace]] and [[power]] of their [[country]] was not made
on the altar of [[freedom]]. [[freedom]], and a [[better]] security for [[freedom]] than
that they have taken, they might have had without any [[sacrifice]] at all.
they brought themselves into all the calamities they suffer, not that
through them they might obtain a british [[constitution]]; they plunged
themselves headlong into those calamities to prevent themselves from
settling into that [[constitution]], or into anything resembling it.

that, if they should perfectly succeed in what they propose, as they are
likely enough to do, and establish a [[democracy]], or a mob of democracies [[democracy]],
in a [[country]] circumstanced like [[france]], they will establish a very bad
government,--a very [[bad]] [[species]] of [[tyranny]].

that the worst effect of all their proceeding was on their [[military]],
which was rendered an [[army]] for every [[purpose]] but that of defence. that,
if the [[question]] was, whether soldiers were to forget they were [[citizens]],
as an abstract proposition, he could have no difference about it;
though, as it is usual, when abstract principles [[principle]] are to be applied, much
was to be [[thought]] on the manner of uniting the [[character]] of citizen and
soldier. but as applied to the events which had happened in [[france]],
where the abstract [[principle]] was clothed with its circumstances, he
thought that his friend would agree with him, that what was done there
furnished no matter of exultation, either in the act or the [[example]].
these soldiers were not [[citizens]], but base, hireling mutineers, and
mercenary, sordid deserters, wholly destitute of any honorable
principle. their conduct was one of the fruits of that anarchic spirit
from the evils [[evil]] of which a [[democracy]] itself was to be resorted to, by
those who were the least disposed to that form, as a sort of refuge. it
was not an [[army]] in corps and with discipline, and embodied under the
respectable patriot [[citizens]] of the [[state]] in resisting [[tyranny]]. nothing
like it. it was the case of [[common]] soldiers deserting from their
officers, to join a furious, licentious populace. it was a desertion to
a cause the real object of which was to level all those [[institutions]],
and to break all those connections, [[natural]] and civil, that regulate and
hold together the [[community]] by a chain of subordination: to raise
soldiers against their officers, servants against their masters,
tradesmen against their customers, artificers against their employers,
tenants against their landlords, curates against their bishops, and
children against their parents. that this cause of theirs was not an
enemy to servitude, but to [[society]].

he wished the house to consider how the members would like to have their
mansions pulled down and pillaged, their persons [[person]] abused, insulted, and
destroyed, their title-deeds brought out and burned before their faces,
and themselves and their families [[family]] driven to seek refuge in every nation
throughout [[europe]], for no other [[reason]] than this, that, without any
fault of theirs, they were born gentlemen and [[men]] of [[property]], and were
suspected of a [[desire]] to preserve their consideration and their estates.
the desertion in [[france]] was to aid an abominable sedition, the very
professed [[principle]] of which was an implacable hostility to nobility and
gentry, and whose savage war-whoop was, _"a l'aristocrate!"_--by which
senseless, bloody cry they animated one another to rapine and murder;
whilst abetted by ambitious [[men]] of another class, they were crushing
everything respectable and [[virtuous]] in their nation, and to their power
disgracing almost every name by which we formerly knew there was such a
country in the [[world]] as [[france]].

he knew too well, and he [[felt]] as much as any [[man]], how difficult it was
to accommodate a standing [[army]] to a [[free]] [[constitution]], or to any
constitution. an armed disciplined [[body]] is, in its essence, dangerous to
liberty; undisciplined, it is ruinous to [[society]]. its component parts
are in the latter case neither [[good]] [[citizens]] nor [[good]] soldiers. what
have they [[thought]] of in [[france]], under such a difficulty as almost puts
the [[human]] faculties to a stand? they have put their [[army]] under such a
variety of principles [[principle]] of [[duty]], that it is more likely to breed
litigants, pettifoggers, and mutineers than soldiers.[76] they have set
up, to balance their [[crown]] [[army]], another [[army]], deriving under another
authority, called a municipal [[army]],--a balance of armies [[army]], not of orders.
these latter they have destroyed with every mark of insult and
oppression. states may, and they will [[best]], [[exist]] with a partition of
civil powers [[power]]. armies [[army]] cannot [[exist]] under a divided command. this [[state]] of
things he [[thought]] in effect a [[state]] of [[war]], or at [[best]] but a truce,
instead of [[peace]], in the [[country]].

what a dreadful thing is a standing [[army]] for the conduct of the whole or
any part of which no [[man]] is responsible! in the [[present]] [[state]] of the
french [[crown]] [[army]], is the [[crown]] responsible for the whole of it? is
there any general who can be responsible for the [[obedience]] of a
brigade, any colonel for that of a regiment, any captain for that of a
company? and as to the municipal [[army]], reinforced as it is by the new
citizen deserters, under whose command are they? have we not seen them,
not [[led]] by, but dragging, their nominal commander, with a rope about his
neck, when they, or those whom they accompanied, proceeded to the most
atrocious acts of [[treason]] and murder? are any of these armies [[army]]? are any
of these [[citizens]]?

we have in such a difficulty as that of fitting a standing [[army]] to the
state, he conceived, done much [[better]]. we have not distracted our army
by divided principles [[principle]] of [[obedience]]. we have put them under a single
authority, with a simple (our common) oath of fidelity; and we keep the
whole under our annual inspection. this was doing all that could be
safely done.

he [[felt]] some concern that this [[strange]] thing called a [[revolution]] in
france should be compared with the glorious event commonly called the
revolution in [[england]], and the conduct of the soldiery on that occasion
compared with the behavior of some of the [[troops]] of [[france]] in the
present instance. at that period, the [[prince]] of orange, a [[prince]] of the
blood-royal in [[england]], was called in by the flower of the english
aristocracy to defend its ancient [[constitution]], and not to level all
distinctions. to this [[prince]], so invited, the aristocratic leaders who
commanded the [[troops]] went over with their several corps, in bodies [[body]], to
the deliverer of their [[country]]. aristocratic leaders brought up the
corps of [[citizens]] who newly enlisted in this cause. [[military]] obedience
changed its object; but [[military]] discipline was not for a moment
interrupted in its [[principle]]. the [[troops]] were ready for [[war]], but
indisposed to mutiny.

but as the conduct of the english armies [[army]] was different, so was that of
the whole english nation at that [[time]]. in [[truth]], the circumstances of
our [[revolution]] (as it is called) and that of [[france]] are just the reverse
of each other in almost every particular, and in the whole spirit of the
transaction. with us it was the case of a legal monarch attempting
arbitrary [[power]]; in [[france]] it is the case of an arbitrary monarch
beginning, from whatever cause, to legalize his [[authority]]. the one was
to be resisted, the other was to be managed and directed; but in neither
case was the order of the [[state]] to be changed, lest [[government]] might be
ruined, which ought only to be corrected and legalized. with us we got
rid of the [[man]], and preserved the constituent parts of the [[state]]. there
they get rid of the constituent parts of the [[state]], and keep the [[man]].
what we did was in [[truth]] and substance, and in a constitutional [[light]], a
revolution, not made, but prevented. we took solid securities; we
settled doubtful questions [[question]]; we corrected anomalies in our [[law]]. in the
stable, fundamental parts of our [[constitution]] we made no
revolution,--no, nor any alteration at all. we did not impair the
monarchy. perhaps it might be shown that we strengthened it very
considerably. the nation kept the same ranks, the same orders, the same
privileges, the same franchises, the same rules [[rule]] for [[property]], the same
subordinations, the same order in the [[law]], in the [[revenue]], and in the
magistracy,--the same lords [[lord]], the same commons [[common]], the same corporations,
the same electors.

the [[church]] was not impaired. her estates, her majesty, her splendor, her
orders and gradations, continued the same. she was preserved in her
full efficiency, and cleared only of a [[certain]] intolerance, which was
her weakness and disgrace. the [[church]] and the [[state]] were the same after
the [[revolution]] that they were before, but [[better]] secured in every part.

was little done because a [[revolution]] was not made in the [[constitution]]?
no! everything was done; because we commenced with reparation, not with
ruin. accordingly, the [[state]] flourished. instead of lying as [[dead]], in a
sort of trance, or exposed, as some others, in an epileptic fit, to the
pity or derision of the [[world]], for her wild, ridiculous, convulsive
movements, impotent to every [[purpose]] but that of dashing out her brains
against the pavement, [[great]] [[britain]] rose above the standard even of her
former [[self]]. an era of a more improved domestic [[prosperity]] then
commenced, and still continues, not only unimpaired, but growing, under
the wasting hand of [[time]]. all the energies of the [[country]] were awakened.
england never preserved a firmer countenance or a more vigorous arm to
all her enemies [[enemy]] and to all her rivals. [[europe]] under her respired and
revived. everywhere she appeared as the protector, assertor, or avenger
of [[liberty]]. a [[war]] was made and supported against [[fortune]] itself. the
treaty of ryswick, which first limited the [[power]] of [[france]], was soon
after made; the grand [[alliance]] very shortly followed, which shook to the
foundations the dreadful [[power]] which menaced the independence of
mankind. the states of [[europe]] lay [[happy]] under the shade of a [[great]] and
free [[monarchy]], which knew how to be [[great]] without endangering its own
peace at [[home]] or the internal or external [[peace]] of any of its
neighbors.

mr. burke said he should have [[felt]] very unpleasantly, if he had not
delivered these sentiments. he was near the end of his [[natural]], probably
still nearer the end of his [[political]] [[career]]. that he was [[weak]] and
weary, and wished for rest. that he was little disposed to
controversies, or what is called a detailed opposition. that at his time
of [[life]], if he could not do something by some sort of weight of [[opinion]],
natural or acquired, it was useless and indecorous to attempt anything
by mere struggle. _turpe senex miles_. that he had for that reason
little attended the [[army]] [[business]], or that of the [[revenue]], or almost any
other matter of detail, for some years [[past]]. that he had, however, his
task. he was far from condemning such opposition; on the contrary, he
most highly applauded it, where a just [[occasion]] existed for it, and
gentlemen had vigor and capacity to pursue it. where a [[great]] occasion
occurred, he was, and, while he continued in [[parliament]], would be,
amongst the most active and the most earnest,--as he hoped he had shown
on a late event. with [[respect]] to the [[constitution]] itself, he wished few
alterations in it,--happy if he left it not the worse for any share he
had taken in its service.

       *       *       *       *       *

mr. fox then rose, and declared, in substance, that, so far as regarded
the french [[army]], he went no farther than the general [[principle]], by which
that [[army]] showed itself indisposed to be an instrument in the servitude
of their fellow-citizens, but did not enter into the particulars of
their conduct. he declared that he did not affect a [[democracy]]: that he
always [[thought]] any of the simple, unbalanced governments [[government]] [[bad]]: simple
monarchy, simple [[aristocracy]], simple [[democracy]],--he held them all
imperfect or vicious; all were [[bad]] by themselves; the composition alone
was [[good]]. that these had been always his principles [[principle]], in which he had
agreed with his friend mr. burke,--of whom he had said many [[kind]] and
flattering things, which mr. burke, i take it for granted, will know
himself too well to [[think]] he merits [[merit]] from anything but mr. fox's
acknowledged good-nature. mr. fox [[thought]], however, that, in many cases,
mr. burke was rather carried too far by his [[hatred]] to innovation.

mr. burke said, he well knew that these had been mr. fox's invariable
opinions; that they were a sure ground for the confidence of his
country. but he had been fearful that cabals of very different
intentions would be ready to make use of his [[great]] name, against his
character and sentiments, in order to derive a credit to their
destructive machinations.

mr. sheridan then rose, and made a lively and eloquent [[speech]] against
mr. burke; in which, among other things, he said that mr. burke had
libelled the national assembly of [[france]], and had cast out reflections
on such characters [[character]] as those of the marquis de la fayette and mr. bailly.

mr. burke said, that he did not libel the national assembly of [[france]],
whom he considered very little in the discussion of these matters. that
he [[thought]] all the substantial [[power]] resided in the [[republic]] of [[paris]],
whose [[authority]] guided, or whose [[example]] was followed by, all the
republics of [[france]]. the [[republic]] of [[paris]] had an [[army]] under their
orders, and not under those of the national assembly.

n.b. as to the particular gentlemen, i do not [[remember]] that mr. burke
mentioned either of them,--certainly not mr. bailly. he alluded,
undoubtedly, to the case of the marquis de la fayette; but whether what
he asserted of him be a libel on him must be left to those who are
acquainted with the [[business]].

mr. pitt concluded the debate with becoming gravity and [[dignity]], and a
reserve on both sides of the [[question]], as related to [[france]], fit for a
person in a ministerial situation. he said, that what he had spoken only
regarded [[france]] when she should unite, which he rather [[thought]] she soon
might, with the [[liberty]] she had acquired, the blessings of [[law]] and
order. he, too, said several civil things concerning the sentiments of
mr. burke, as applied to this [[country]].

footnotes:

[75] mr. burke probably had in his [[mind]] the remainder of the passage,
and was filled with some congenial apprehensions:--

    hæc finis priami fatorum; hic exitus illum
    sorte tulit, trojam incensam et prolapsa videntem
    pergama, tot quondam populis terrisque superbum
    regnatorem asiæ. jacet ingens littore truncus,
    avolsumque humeris caput, et sine nomine corpus.
    _at me_ tum primum sævus circumstetit [[horror]].
    obstupui: _subiit chari genitoris imago_.



[76] they are sworn to obey the [[king]], the nation, and the [[law]].




reflections

on the

revolution in [[france]],

the proceedings in [[certain]] societies [[society]] in

london relative to that event:

in a letter

intended to have been sent to a gentleman in [[paris]].

1790.


it may not be unnecessary to inform the reader that the following
reflections had their origin in a correspondence between the author and
a very [[young]] gentleman at [[paris]], who did him the [[honor]] of desiring his
opinion upon the important transactions which then, and ever since have,
so much occupied the attention of all [[men]]. an [[answer]] was written some
time in the month of october, 1789; but it was kept back upon prudential
considerations. that letter is alluded to in the beginning of the
following sheets. it has been since forwarded to the [[person]] to whom it
was addressed. the reasons [[reason]] for the delay in sending it were assigned in
a short letter to the same gentleman. this produced on his part a new
and pressing application for the author's sentiments.

the author began a second and more full discussion on the [[subject]]. this
he had some thoughts [[thought]] of publishing early in the [[last]] spring; but the
matter gaining upon him, he found that what he had undertaken not only
far exceeded the measure of a letter, but that its importance required
rather a more detailed consideration than at that [[time]] he had any
leisure to bestow upon it. however, having thrown down his first
thoughts in the form of a letter, and, indeed, when he sat down to
write, having intended it for a private letter, he found it difficult to
change the form of address, when his sentiments had grown into a greater
extent and had received another direction. a different plan, he is
sensible, might be more favorable to a commodious division and
distribution of his matter.




reflections

on

the [[revolution]] in [[france]].


dear sir,--you are pleased to call again, and with some earnestness, for
my thoughts [[thought]] on the late proceedings in [[france]]. i will not give you
reason to imagine that i [[think]] my sentiments of such value as to wish
myself to be solicited about them. they are of too little consequence to
be very anxiously either communicated or withheld. it was from attention
to you, and to you only, that i hesitated at the [[time]] when you first
desired to receive them. in the first letter i had the [[honor]] to write to
you, and which at length i send, i wrote neither for nor from any
description of [[men]]; nor shall i in this. my errors, if any, are my own.
my [[reputation]] alone is to [[answer]] for them.

you see, sir, by the long letter i have transmitted to you, that, though
i do most heartily [[wish]] that [[france]] may be animated by a spirit of
rational [[liberty]], and that i [[think]] you bound, in all honest policy, to
provide a permanent [[body]] in which that spirit may reside, and an
effectual organ by which it may act, it is my misfortune to entertain
great doubts [[doubt]] concerning several material points in your late
transactions.

you imagined, when you wrote [[last]], that i might possibly be reckoned
among the approvers of [[certain]] proceedings in [[france]], from the solemn
public seal of sanction they have received from two clubs of gentlemen
in [[london]], called the constitutional [[society]], and the revolution
society.

i certainly have the [[honor]] to belong to more clubs than one in which the
constitution of this [[kingdom]] and the principles [[principle]] of the glorious
revolution are held in high reverence; and i reckon myself among the
most forward in my zeal for maintaining that [[constitution]] and those
principles in their utmost purity and vigor. it is because i do so that
i [[think]] it necessary for me that there should be no mistake. those who
cultivate the memory of our [[revolution]], and those who are attached to
the [[constitution]] of this [[kingdom]], will take [[good]] [[care]] how they are
involved with persons [[person]] who, under the pretext of zeal towards the
revolution and [[constitution]], too frequently wander from their true
principles, and are ready on every [[occasion]] to depart from the firm, but
cautious and deliberate, spirit which produced the one and which
presides in the other. before i proceed to [[answer]] the more material
particulars in your letter, i shall beg leave to give you such
information as i have been able to obtain of the two clubs which have
thought proper, as bodies [[body]], to interfere in the concerns of
france,--first assuring you that i am not, and that i have never been, a
member of either of those societies [[society]].

the first, calling itself the constitutional [[society]], or [[society]] for
constitutional information, or by some such title, is, i [[believe]], of
seven or eight years' standing. the institution of this [[society]] appears
to be of a charitable, and so far of a laudable [[nature]]: it was intended
for the circulation, at the expense of the members, of many books [[book]] which
few others would be at the expense of buying, and which might [[lie]] on the
hands of the booksellers, to the [[great]] loss of an useful [[body]] of [[men]].
whether the books [[book]] so charitably circulated were ever as charitably read
is more than i [[know]]. possibly several of them have been exported to
france, and, like goods [[good]] not in request here, may with you have found a
market. i have heard much talk of the lights [[light]] to be drawn from books [[book]] that
are sent from hence. what improvements they have had in their passage
(as it is said some liquors are meliorated by crossing the sea) i cannot
tell; but i never heard a [[man]] of [[common]] [[judgment]] or the least [[degree]] of
information speak a word in [[praise]] of the greater part of the
publications circulated by that [[society]]; nor have their proceedings been
accounted, except by some of themselves, as of any serious consequence.

your national assembly seems to entertain much the same [[opinion]] that i
do of this [[poor]] charitable club. as a nation, you reserved the whole
stock of your eloquent acknowledgments for the [[revolution]] [[society]], when
their fellows in the constitutional were in equity entitled to some
share. since you have selected the [[revolution]] [[society]] as the great
object of your national thanks and praises [[praise]], you will [[think]] me excusable
in making its late conduct the [[subject]] of my observations. the national
assembly of [[france]] has given importance to these gentlemen by adopting
them; and they return the favor by acting as a committee in [[england]] for
extending the principles [[principle]] of the national assembly. henceforward we must
consider them as a [[kind]] of privileged persons [[person]], as no inconsiderable
members in the diplomatic [[body]]. this is one among the revolutions [[revolution]] which
have given splendor to obscurity and distinction to undiscerned [[merit]].
until very lately i do not recollect to have heard of this club. i am
quite sure that it never occupied a moment of my thoughts [[thought]],--nor, i
believe, those of any [[person]] out of their own set. i find, upon inquiry,
that, on the anniversary of the [[revolution]] in 1688, a club of
dissenters, but of what denomination i [[know]] not, have long had the
custom of hearing a sermon in one of their churches [[church]], and that afterwards
they spent the day cheerfully, as other clubs do, at the tavern. but i
never heard that any [[public]] measure or [[political]] [[system]], much less that
the merits [[merit]] of the [[constitution]] of any [[foreign]] nation, had been the
subject of a formal proceeding at their festivals, until, to my
inexpressible surprise, i found them in a sort of [[public]] capacity, by a
congratulatory address, giving an authoritative sanction to the
proceedings of the national assembly in [[france]].

in the ancient principles [[principle]] and conduct of the club, so far at least as
they were declared, i see nothing to which i could take exception. i
think it very probable, that, for some [[purpose]], new members may have
entered among them,--and that some truly [[christian]] politicians, who love
to dispense benefits, but are careful to conceal the hand which
distributes the dole, may have made them the instruments of their pious
designs. whatever i may have [[reason]] to suspect concerning private
management, i shall speak of nothing as of a certainty but what is
public.

for one, i should be [[sorry]] to be [[thought]] directly or indirectly
concerned in their proceedings. i certainly take my full share, along
with the rest of the [[world]], in my [[individual]] and private capacity, in
speculating on what has been done, or is doing, on the [[public]] stage, in
any place, ancient or [[modern]],--in the [[republic]] of [[rome]], or the republic
of [[paris]]; but having no general apostolical mission, being a citizen of
a particular [[state]], and being bound up, in a considerable [[degree]], by its
public will, i should [[think]] it at least improper and irregular for me to
open a formal [[public]] correspondence with the actual [[government]] of a
foreign nation, without the express [[authority]] of the [[government]] under
which i [[live]].

i should be still more unwilling to enter into that correspondence under
anything like an equivocal description, which to many, unacquainted with
our usages, might make the address in which i joined appear as the act
of persons [[person]] in some sort of corporate capacity, acknowledged by the laws
of this [[kingdom]], and authorized to speak the sense of some part of it.
on account of the ambiguity and uncertainty of unauthorized general
descriptions, and of the deceit which may be practised under them, and
not from mere formality, the house of commons [[common]] would reject the most
sneaking petition for the most trifling object, under that mode of
signature to which you have thrown open the folding-doors of your
presence-chamber, and have ushered into your national assembly with as
much [[ceremony]] and parade, and with as [[great]] a bustle of applause, as if
you had been visited by the whole representative majesty of the whole
english nation. if what this [[society]] has [[thought]] proper to send forth
had been a piece of argument, it would have signified little whose
argument it was. it would be neither the more nor the less convincing on
account of the party it came from. but this is only a vote and
resolution. it stands solely on [[authority]]; and in this case it is the
mere [[authority]] of individuals [[individual]], few of whom appear. their signatures
ought, in my [[opinion]], to have been annexed to their instrument. the
world would then have the means of knowing how many they are, who they
are, and of what value their opinions [[opinion]] may be, from their personal
abilities, from their [[knowledge]], their [[experience]], or their lead and
authority in this [[state]]. to me, who am but a plain [[man]], the proceeding
looks a little too refined and too ingenious; it has too much the air of
a [[political]] stratagem, adopted for the sake of giving, under a
high-sounding name, an importance to the [[public]] declarations of this
club, which, when the matter came to be closely inspected, they did not
altogether so well deserve. it is a policy that has very much the
complexion of a fraud.

i flatter myself that i [[love]] a manly, [[moral]], regulated [[liberty]] as well
as any gentleman of that [[society]], be he who he will; and perhaps i have
given as [[good]] proofs of my attachment to that cause, in the whole course
of my [[public]] conduct. i [[think]] i envy [[liberty]] as little as they do to any
other nation. but i cannot stand forward, and give [[praise]] or blame to
anything which relates to [[human]] actions and [[human]] concerns on a simple
view of the object, as it stands stripped of every relation, in all the
nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction. circumstances (which
with some gentlemen pass for nothing) give in reality to every political
principle its distinguishing color and discriminating effect. the
circumstances are what render every civil and [[political]] scheme
beneficial or noxious to [[mankind]]. abstractedly speaking, [[government]], as
well as [[liberty]], is [[good]]; yet could i, in [[common]] sense, ten years ago,
have felicitated [[france]] on her enjoyment of a [[government]], (for she then
had a [[government]],) without inquiry what the [[nature]] of that government
was, or how it was administered? can i now congratulate the same nation
upon its [[freedom]]? is it because [[liberty]] in the abstract may be classed
amongst the blessings of [[mankind]], that i am seriously to felicitate a
madman who has escaped from the protecting restraint and wholesome
darkness of his cell on his restoration to the enjoyment of [[light]] and
liberty? am i to congratulate a highwayman and murderer who has broke
prison upon the recovery of his [[natural]] rights [[right]]? this would be to act
over again the scene of the criminals [[criminal]] condemned to the galleys, and
their heroic deliverer, the metaphysic knight of the sorrowful
countenance.

when i see the spirit of [[liberty]] in action, i see a [[strong]] [[principle]] at
work; and this, for a while, is all i can possibly [[know]] of it. the wild
gas, the fixed air, is plainly broke loose: but we ought to suspend our
judgment until the first effervescence is a little subsided, till the
liquor is cleared, and until we see something deeper than the agitation
of a troubled and frothy surface. i must be tolerably sure, before i
venture publicly to congratulate [[men]] upon a blessing, that they have
really received one. [[flattery]] corrupts both the receiver and the giver;
and adulation is not of more service to the [[people]] than to kings [[king]]. i
should therefore suspend my congratulations on the new [[liberty]] of
france, until i was informed how it had been combined with [[government]],
with [[public]] [[force]], with the discipline and [[obedience]] of armies [[army]], with the
collection of an effective and well-distributed [[revenue]], with morality
and [[religion]], with solidity and [[property]], with [[peace]] and order, with
civil and social manners. all these (in their way) are [[good]] things, too;
and without them, [[liberty]] is not a benefit whilst it lasts, and is not
likely to continue long. the effect of [[liberty]] to individuals [[individual]] is, that
they may do what they please: we ought to see what it will please them
to do, before we risk congratulations, which may be soon turned into
complaints. prudence would dictate this in the case of separate,
insulated, private [[men]]. but [[liberty]], when [[men]] act in bodies [[body]], is _power_.
considerate [[people]], before they declare themselves, will observe the use
which is made of _power_,--and particularly of so trying a thing as
_new_ [[power]] in _new_ persons [[person]], of whose principles [[principle]], tempers, and
dispositions they have little or no [[experience]], and in situations where
those who appear the most stirring in the scene may possibly not be the
real movers.

all these considerations, however, were below the transcendental dignity
of the [[revolution]] [[society]]. whilst i continued in the [[country]], from
whence i had the [[honor]] of writing to you, i had but an imperfect [[idea]] of
their transactions. on my coming to town, i sent for an account of their
proceedings, which had been published by their [[authority]], containing a
sermon of dr. price, with the duke de rochefoucault's and the archbishop
of aix's letter and several other documents annexed. the whole of that
publication, with the manifest design of connecting the affairs of
france with those of [[england]], by drawing us into an imitation of the
conduct of the national assembly, gave me a considerable [[degree]] of
uneasiness. the effect of that conduct upon the [[power]], credit,
prosperity, and tranquillity of [[france]] became every day more evident.
the form of [[constitution]] to be settled, for its future polity, became
more clear. we are now in a condition to discern with tolerable
exactness the true [[nature]] of the object held up to our imitation. if the
prudence of reserve and decorum dictates [[silence]] in some circumstances,
in others prudence of a higher order may justify us in speaking our
thoughts. the beginnings of confusion with us in [[england]] are at present
feeble enough; but with you we have seen an infancy still more feeble
growing by moments into a [[strength]] to heap mountains upon mountains, and
to wage [[war]] with [[heaven]] itself. whenever our neighbor's house is on
fire, it cannot be amiss for the engines to play a little on our own.
better to be despised for too anxious apprehensions than ruined by too
confident a security.

solicitous chiefly for the [[peace]] of my own [[country]], but by no means
unconcerned for yours, i [[wish]] to communicate more largely what was at
first intended only for your private satisfaction. i shall still keep
your affairs in my eye, and continue to address myself to you. indulging
myself in the [[freedom]] of epistolary intercourse, i beg leave to throw
out my thoughts [[thought]] and express my feelings just as they arise in my [[mind]],
with very little attention to formal method. i set out with the
proceedings of the [[revolution]] [[society]]; but i shall not confine myself to
them. is it possible i should? it looks to me as if i were in a great
crisis, not of the affairs of [[france]] alone, but of all [[europe]], perhaps
of more than [[europe]]. all circumstances taken together, the french
revolution is the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the
world. the most wonderful things are brought about in many instances by
means the most absurd and ridiculous, in the most ridiculous modes, and
apparently by the most contemptible instruments. everything seems out of
nature in this [[strange]] [[chaos]] of levity and ferocity, and of all sorts of
crimes jumbled together with all sorts of follies. in viewing this
monstrous tragi-comic scene, the most opposite [[passions]] necessarily
succeed and sometimes mix with each other in the [[mind]]: alternate
contempt and indignation, alternate laughter and tears, alternate scorn
and [[horror]].

it cannot, however, be denied that to some this [[strange]] scene appeared
in quite another point of view. into them it inspired no other
sentiments than those of exultation and rapture. they saw nothing in
what has been done in [[france]] but a firm and temperate exertion of
freedom,--so consistent, on the whole, with morals [[moral]] and with piety as to
make it deserving not only of the secular applause of dashing
machiavelian politicians, but to render it a fit theme for all the
devout effusions of [[sacred]] eloquence.

       *       *       *       *       *

on the forenoon of the fourth of november [[last]], doctor richard price, a
non-conforming minister of eminence, preached at the dissenting
meeting-house of the old jewry, to his club or [[society]], a very
extraordinary miscellaneous sermon, in which there are some [[good]] moral
and [[religious]] sentiments, and not ill expressed, mixed up with a sort of
porridge of various [[political]] opinions [[opinion]] and reflections: but the
revolution in [[france]] is the grand ingredient in the caldron. i consider
the address transmitted by the [[revolution]] [[society]] to the national
assembly, through earl stanhope, as originating in the principles [[principle]] of
the sermon, and as a corollary from them. it was moved by the preacher
of that discourse. it was passed by those who came reeking from the
effect of the sermon, without any censure or qualification, expressed or
implied. if, however, any of the gentlemen concerned shall [[wish]] to
separate the sermon from the resolution, they [[know]] how to acknowledge
the one and to disavow the other. they may do it: i cannot.

for my part, i looked on that sermon as the [[public]] declaration of a man
much connected with literary caballers and intriguing [[philosophers]], with
political theologians and theological politicians, both at [[home]] and
abroad. i [[know]] they set him up as a sort of oracle; because, with the
best intentions in the [[world]], he naturally _philippizes_, and chants his
prophetic [[song]] in exact unison with their designs.

that sermon is in a strain which i [[believe]] has not been heard in this
kingdom, in any of the pulpits which are tolerated or encouraged in it,
since the year 1648,--when a predecessor of dr. price, the reverend hugh
peters, made the vault of the king's own chapel at st. james's ring with
the [[honor]] and [[privilege]] of the saints, who, with the "high praises [[praise]] of
god in their mouths, and a _two_-edged [[sword]] in their hands, were to
execute [[judgment]] on the heathen, and punishments [[punishment]] upon the _people_; to
bind their _kings_ with chains, and their _nobles_ with fetters of
iron."[77] few harangues from the pulpit, except in the days of your
league in [[france]], or in the days of our solemn league and covenant in
england, have ever breathed less of the spirit of moderation than this
lecture in the old jewry. supposing, however, that something like
moderation were visible in this [[political]] sermon, yet [[politics]] and the
pulpit are terms that have little agreement. no sound ought to be heard
in the [[church]] but the healing voice of [[christian]] charity. the cause of
civil [[liberty]] and civil [[government]] gains as little as that of religion
by this confusion of duties [[duty]]. those who quit their proper [[character]] to
assume what does not belong to them are, for the greater part, ignorant
both of the [[character]] they leave and of the [[character]] they assume.
wholly unacquainted with the [[world]], in which they are so fond of
meddling, and inexperienced in all its affairs, on which they pronounce
with so much confidence, they have nothing of [[politics]] but the passions
they excite. surely the [[church]] is a place where one day's truce ought to
be allowed to the dissensions and animosities of [[mankind]].

this pulpit style, revived after so long a discontinuance, had to me the
air of novelty, and of a novelty not wholly without danger. i do not
charge this danger equally to every part of the discourse. the hint
given to a [[noble]] and reverend lay-divine, who is supposed high in office
in one of our universities [[university]],[78] and other lay-divines "of _rank_ and
literature," may be proper and seasonable, though somewhat new. if the
noble _seekers_ should find nothing to satisfy their pious fancies in
the old staple of the national [[church]], or in all the [[rich]] variety to be
found in the well-assorted warehouses of the dissenting congregations,
dr. price advises them to improve upon non-conformity, and to set up,
each of them, a separate meeting-house upon his own particular
principles.[79] it is somewhat remarkable that this reverend divine
should be so earnest for setting up new churches [[church]], and so perfectly
indifferent concerning the doctrine which may be taught in them. his
zeal is of a [[curious]] [[character]]. it is not for the propagation of his own
opinions, but of any opinions [[opinion]]. it is not for the diffusion of [[truth]], but
for the spreading of contradiction. let the [[noble]] teachers but dissent,
it is no matter from whom or from what. this [[great]] point once secured,
it is taken for granted their [[religion]] will be [[rational]] and manly. i
doubt whether [[religion]] would reap all the benefits which the calculating
divine computes from this "great company of [[great]] preachers." it would
certainly be a valuable addition of nondescripts to the ample collection
of known classes, genera, and [[species]], which at [[present]] beautify the
_hortus siccus_ of dissent. a sermon from a [[noble]] duke, or a noble
marquis, or a [[noble]] earl, or baron bold, would certainly increase and
diversify the amusements of this town, which begins to grow satiated
with the uniform round of its vapid dissipations. i should only
stipulate that these new _mess-johns_ in robes and coronets should keep
some sort of bounds in the democratic and levelling principles [[principle]] which are
expected from their titled pulpits. the new evangelists will, i dare
say, disappoint the hopes [[hope]] that are conceived of them. they will not
become, literally as well as figuratively, polemic divines,--nor be
disposed so to drill their congregations, that they may, as in former
blessed times [[time]], preach their doctrines to regiments of dragoons and corps
of infantry and artillery. such arrangements, however favorable to the
cause of compulsory [[freedom]], civil and [[religious]], may not be equally
conducive to the national tranquillity. these few restrictions i hope
are no [[great]] stretches of intolerance, no very [[violent]] exertions of
despotism.

but i may say of our preacher, "_utinam nugis tota illa dedisset et
tempora sævitiæ_." all things in this his fulminating bull are not of so
innoxious a tendency. his doctrines affect our [[constitution]] in its vital
parts. he tells the [[revolution]] [[society]], in this [[political]] sermon, that
his majesty "is almost the _only_ lawful [[king]] in the [[world]], because the
_only_ one who owes his [[crown]] to _the [[choice]] of his people_." as to the
kings of _the world_, all of whom (except one) this arch-pontiff of the
_rights of men_, with all the plenitude and with more than the boldness
of the papal deposing [[power]] in its meridian fervor of the twelfth
century, puts into one sweeping clause of ban and anathema, and
proclaims usurpers by circles of longitude and latitude over the whole
globe, it behooves them to consider how they admit into their
territories these apostolic missionaries, who are to tell their subjects
they are not lawful kings [[king]]. that is their concern. it is ours, as a
domestic interest of some moment, seriously to consider the solidity of
the _only_ [[principle]] upon which these gentlemen acknowledge a [[king]] of
great [[britain]] to be entitled to their allegiance.

this doctrine, as applied to the [[prince]] now on the british [[throne]],
either is nonsense, and therefore neither true nor false, or it affirms
a most unfounded, dangerous, illegal, and unconstitutional position.
according to this [[spiritual]] doctor of [[politics]], if his majesty does not
owe his [[crown]] to the [[choice]] of his [[people]], he is no _lawful_ [[king]]. now
nothing can be more untrue than that the [[crown]] of this [[kingdom]] is so
held by his majesty. therefore, if you [[follow]] their [[rule]], the [[king]] of
great [[britain]], who most certainly does not owe his high office to any
form of popular election, is in no [[respect]] [[better]] than the rest of the
gang of usurpers, who reign, or rather rob, all over the face of this
our miserable [[world]], without any sort of [[right]] or title to the
allegiance of their [[people]]. the policy of this general doctrine, so
qualified, is evident enough. the propagators of this [[political]] gospel
are in hopes [[hope]] their abstract [[principle]] (their [[principle]] that a popular
choice is necessary to the legal existence of the [[sovereign]] magistracy)
would be overlooked, whilst the [[king]] of [[great]] [[britain]] was not affected
by it. in the mean [[time]] the ears of their congregations would be
gradually habituated to it, as if it were a first [[principle]] admitted
without dispute. for the [[present]] it would only operate as a theory,
pickled in the preserving juices of pulpit eloquence, and laid by for
future use. _condo et compono quæ mox depromere passim_. by this policy,
whilst our [[government]] is soothed with a reservation in its favor, to
which it has no claim, the security which it has in [[common]] with all
governments, so far as [[opinion]] is security, is taken away.

thus these politicians proceed, whilst little notice is taken of their
doctrines; but when they come to be examined upon the plain meaning of
their words and the direct tendency of their doctrines, then
equivocations and slippery constructions come into play. when they say
the [[king]] owes his [[crown]] to the [[choice]] of his [[people]], and is therefore
the only lawful [[sovereign]] in the [[world]], they will perhaps tell us they
mean to say no more than that some of the king's predecessors have been
called to the [[throne]] by some sort of [[choice]], and therefore he owes his
crown to the [[choice]] of his [[people]]. thus, by a miserable subterfuge, they
hope to render their proposition safe by rendering it nugatory. they are
welcome to the asylum they seek for their offence, since they take
refuge in their folly. for, if you admit this interpretation, how does
their [[idea]] of election differ from our [[idea]] of [[inheritance]]? and how does
the settlement of the [[crown]] in the brunswick line, derived from james
the first, come to legalize our [[monarchy]] rather than that of any of the
neighboring countries [[country]]? at some [[time]] or other, to be sure, all the
beginners of dynasties were chosen by those who called them to govern.
there is ground enough for the [[opinion]] that all the kingdoms [[kingdom]] of europe
were at a remote period elective, with more or fewer limitations in the
objects of [[choice]]. but whatever kings [[king]] might have been here or elsewhere
a thousand years ago, or in whatever manner the ruling dynasties of
england or [[france]] may have begun, the [[king]] of [[great]] [[britain]] is at this
day [[king]] by a fixed [[rule]] of succession, according to the laws [[law]] of his
country; and whilst the legal conditions of the compact of sovereignty
are performed by him, (as they are performed,) he holds his [[crown]] in
contempt of the [[choice]] of the [[revolution]] [[society]], who have not a single
vote for a [[king]] amongst them, either individually or collectively:
though i make no [[doubt]] they would soon erect themselves into an
electoral college, if things were ripe to give effect to their claim.
his majesty's heirs and successors, each in his [[time]] and order, will
come to the [[crown]] with the same contempt of their [[choice]] with which his
majesty has succeeded to that he wears.

whatever may be the [[success]] of evasion in explaining away the gross
error _fact_, which supposes that his majesty (though he holds it in
concurrence with the wishes) owes his [[crown]] to the [[choice]] of his [[people]],
yet nothing can evade their full, explicit declaration concerning the
principle of a [[right]] in the [[people]] to choose,--which [[right]] is directly
maintained, and tenaciously adhered to. all the oblique insinuations
concerning election bottom in this proposition, and are referable to it.
lest the foundation of the king's exclusive legal title should pass for
a mere rant of adulatory [[freedom]], the [[political]] [[divine]] proceeds
dogmatically to assert,[80] that, by the principles [[principle]] of the [[revolution]],
the [[people]] of [[england]] have acquired three fundamental rights [[right]], all of
which, with him, compose one [[system]], and [[lie]] together in one short
sentence: namely, that we have acquired a right

1. "to choose our own governors."

2. "to cashier them for misconduct."

3. "to frame a [[government]] for ourselves."

this new, and hitherto unheard-of bill of rights [[right]], though made in the
name of the whole [[people]], belongs to those gentlemen and their faction
only. the [[body]] of the [[people]] of [[england]] have no share in it. they
utterly disclaim it. they will resist the practical assertion of it with
their lives [[life]] and fortunes [[fortune]]. they are bound to do so by the laws [[law]] of their
country, made at the [[time]] of that very [[revolution]] which is appealed to
in favor of the fictitious rights [[right]] claimed by the [[society]] which abuses
its name.

these gentlemen of the old jewry, in all their reasonings on the
revolution of 1688, have a [[revolution]] which happened in [[england]] about
forty years before, and the late french [[revolution]], so much before their
eyes and in their hearts [[heart]], that they are constantly confounding all the
three together. it is necessary that we should separate what they
confound. we must recall their erring fancies to the _acts_ of the
revolution which we revere, for the discovery of its true _principles_.
if the _principles_ of the [[revolution]] of 1688 are anywhere to be found,
it is in the statute called the _declaration of right_. in that most
wise, sober, and considerate declaration, drawn up by [[great]] lawyers and
great statesmen, and not by warm and inexperienced enthusiasts, not one
word is said, nor one suggestion made, of a general [[right]] "to choose our
own _governors_, to cashier them for misconduct, and to _form_ a
government for _ourselves_."

this declaration of [[right]] (the act of the 1st of william and [[mary]], sess.
2, ch. 2) is the corner-stone of our [[constitution]], as reinforced,
explained, improved, and in its fundamental principles [[principle]] forever settled.
it is called "an act for declaring the rights [[right]] and liberties [[liberty]] of the
subject, and for _settling_ the _succession_ of the [[crown]]." you will
observe that these rights [[right]] and this succession are declared in one [[body]],
and bound indissolubly together.

a few years after this period, a second opportunity offered for
asserting a [[right]] of election to the [[crown]]. on the prospect of a total
failure of issue from [[king]] william, and from the princess, afterwards
queen anne, the consideration of the settlement of the [[crown]], and of a
further security for the liberties [[liberty]] of the [[people]], again came before the
legislature. did they this second [[time]] make any provision for legalizing
the [[crown]] on the spurious [[revolution]] principles [[principle]] of the old jewry? no.
they followed the principles [[principle]] which prevailed in the declaration of
right; indicating with more precision the persons [[person]] who were to inherit in
the protestant line. this act also incorporated, by the same policy, our
liberties and an hereditary succession in the same act. instead of a
right to choose our own governors, they declared that the _succession_
in that line (the protestant line drawn from james the first) was
absolutely necessary "for the [[peace]], quiet, and security of the realm,"
and that it was equally urgent on them "to maintain a _certainty in the
succession_ thereof, to which the subjects [[subject]] may safely have recourse for
their protection." both these acts, in which are heard the unerring,
unambiguous oracles of [[revolution]] policy, instead of countenancing the
delusive gypsy predictions of a "right to choose our governors," prove
to a demonstration how totally adverse the [[wisdom]] of the nation was from
turning a case of necessity into a [[rule]] of [[law]].

unquestionably there was at the [[revolution]], in the [[person]] of king
william, a small and a temporary deviation from the strict order of a
regular hereditary succession; but it is against all [[genuine]] principles
of jurisprudence to draw a [[principle]] from a [[law]] made in a special case
and regarding an [[individual]] [[person]]. _privilegium non transit in
exemplum_. if ever there was a [[time]] favorable for establishing the
principle that a [[king]] of popular [[choice]] was the only legal [[king]], without
all [[doubt]] it was at the [[revolution]]. its not being done at that [[time]] is
a proof that the nation was of [[opinion]] it ought not to be done at any
time. there is no [[person]] so completely ignorant of our [[history]] as not to
know that the majority in [[parliament]], of both parties, were so little
disposed to anything resembling that [[principle]], that at first they were
determined to place the vacant [[crown]], not on the head of the [[prince]] of
orange, but on that of his [[wife]], [[mary]], [[daughter]] of [[king]] james, the
eldest born of the issue of that [[king]], which they acknowledged as
undoubtedly his. it would be to repeat a very trite story, to recall to
your memory all those circumstances which demonstrated that their
accepting [[king]] william was not properly a _choice_; but to all those who
did not [[wish]] in effect to recall [[king]] james, or to deluge their country
in [[blood]], and again to bring their [[religion]], laws [[law]], and liberties [[liberty]] into
the peril they had just escaped, it was an act of _necessity_, in the
strictest [[moral]] sense in which necessity can be taken.

in the very act in which, for a [[time]], and in a [[single]] case, parliament
departed from the strict order of [[inheritance]], in favor of a [[prince]] who,
though not next, was, however, very near in the line of succession, it
is [[curious]] to observe how [[lord]] somers, who drew the bill called the
declaration of [[right]], has comported himself on that delicate [[occasion]].
it is [[curious]] to observe with what address this temporary solution of
continuity is kept from the eye; whilst all that could be found in this
act of necessity to countenance the [[idea]] of an hereditary succession is
brought forward, and fostered, and made the most of, by this [[great]] [[man]],
and by the legislature who followed him. quitting the dry, imperative
style of an act of [[parliament]], he makes the lords [[lord]] and commons [[common]] fall to a
pious legislative ejaculation, and declare that they consider it "as a
marvellous providence, and merciful goodness of [[god]] to this nation, to
preserve their said majesties' _royal_ persons [[person]] most happily to reign
over us _on the [[throne]] of their ancestors_, for which, from the bottom
of their hearts [[heart]], they return their humblest thanks and praises [[praise]]." the
legislature plainly had in view the act of recognition of the first of
queen elizabeth, chap. 3rd, and of that of james the first, chap. 1st,
both acts strongly declaratory of the inheritable [[nature]] of the [[crown]];
and in many parts they [[follow]], with a nearly literal precision, the
words, and even the form of thanksgiving which is found in these old
declaratory statutes.

the two houses, in the act of [[king]] william, did not thank [[god]] that they
had found a [[fair]] opportunity to assert a [[right]] to choose their own
governors, much less to make an election the _only lawful_ title to the
crown. their having been in a condition to avoid the very appearance of
it, as much as possible, was by them considered as a providential
escape. they threw a [[politic]], well-wrought veil over every circumstance
tending to weaken the rights [[right]] which in the meliorated order of succession
they meant to perpetuate, or which might furnish a precedent for any
future departure from what they had then settled forever. accordingly,
that they might not relax the nerves of their [[monarchy]], and that they
might preserve a close conformity to the practice of their [[ancestors]], as
it appeared in the declaratory statutes of queen mary[81] and queen
elizabeth, in the next clause they vest, by recognition, in their
majesties _all_ the legal prerogatives of the [[crown]], declaring "that in
them they are most _fully_, rightfully, and _entirely_ invested,
incorporated, [[united]], and annexed." in the clause which follows, for
preventing questions [[question]], by [[reason]] of any pretended titles to the [[crown]],
they declare (observing also in this the traditionary [[language]], along
with the traditionary policy of the nation, and repeating as from a
rubric the [[language]] of the preceding acts of elizabeth and james) that
on the preserving "a _certainty_ in the succession thereof the unity,
peace, and tranquillity of this nation doth, under [[god]], wholly depend."

they knew that a doubtful title of succession would but too much
resemble an election, and that an election would be utterly destructive
of the "unity, [[peace]], and tranquillity of this nation," which they
thought to be considerations of some moment. to provide for these
objects, and therefore to exclude forever the old jewry doctrine of "a
right to choose our own governors," they [[follow]] with a clause containing
a most solemn pledge, taken from the preceding act of queen
elizabeth,--as solemn a pledge as ever was or can be given in favor of
an hereditary succession, and as solemn a renunciation as could be made
of the principles [[principle]] by this [[society]] imputed to them:--"the lords [[lord]] spiritual
and temporal, and commons [[common]], do, in the name of all the [[people]] aforesaid,
most humbly and faithfully submit _themselves, their heirs, and
posterities forever_; and do faithfully promise that they will stand to,
maintain, and defend their said majesties, and also the _limitation of
the crown_, herein specified and contained, to the utmost of their
powers," &c., &c.

so far is it from being true that we acquired a [[right]] by the revolution
to elect our kings [[king]], that, if we had possessed it before, the english
nation did at that [[time]] most solemnly renounce and abdicate it, for
themselves, and for all their [[posterity]] forever. these gentlemen may
value themselves as much as they please on their whig principles [[principle]]; but i
never [[desire]] to be [[thought]] a [[better]] whig than [[lord]] somers, or to
understand the principles [[principle]] of the [[revolution]] [[better]] than those by whom it
was brought about, or to [[read]] in the declaration of [[right]] any mysteries
unknown to those whose penetrating style has engraved in our ordinances,
and in our hearts [[heart]], the words and spirit of that [[immortal]] [[law]].

it is true, that, aided with the powers [[power]] derived from [[force]] and
opportunity, the nation was at that [[time]], in some sense, [[free]] to take
what course it pleased for filling the [[throne]],--but only [[free]] to do so
upon the same grounds on which they might have wholly abolished their
monarchy, and every other part of their [[constitution]]. however, they did
not [[think]] such bold changes [[change]] within their commission. it is, indeed,
difficult, perhaps impossible, to give limits to the mere _abstract_
competence of the supreme [[power]], such as was exercised by [[parliament]] at
that [[time]]; but the limits of a _moral_ competence, subjecting, even in
powers more indisputably [[sovereign]], occasional will to permanent [[reason]],
and to the steady maxims [[maxim]] of [[faith]], [[justice]], and fixed fundamental
policy, are perfectly intelligible, and perfectly binding upon those who
exercise any [[authority]], under any name, or under any title, in the
state. the house of lords [[lord]], for instance, is not morally competent to
dissolve the house of commons [[common]],--no, nor even to dissolve itself, nor to
abdicate, if it would, its portion in the legislature of the [[kingdom]].
though a [[king]] may abdicate for his own [[person]], he cannot abdicate for
the [[monarchy]]. by as [[strong]], or by a stronger [[reason]], the house of
commons cannot renounce its share of [[authority]]. the engagement and pact
of [[society]], which generally goes by the name of the [[constitution]],
forbids such [[invasion]] and such [[surrender]]. the constituent parts of a
state are obliged to hold their [[public]] [[faith]] with each other, and with
all those who derive any serious interest under their engagements, as
much as the whole [[state]] is bound to keep its [[faith]] with separate
communities: otherwise, competence and [[power]] would soon be confounded,
and no [[law]] be left but the will of a prevailing [[force]]. on this
principle, the succession of the [[crown]] has always been what it now is,
an hereditary succession by [[law]]: in the old line it was a succession by
the [[common]] [[law]]; in the new by the statute [[law]], operating on the
principles of the [[common]] [[law]], not changing the substance, but regulating
the mode and describing the persons [[person]]. both these descriptions of [[law]] are
of the same [[force]], and are derived from an [[equal]] [[authority]], emanating
from the [[common]] agreement and original compact of the [[state]], _communi
sponsione reipublicæ_, and as such are equally binding on [[king]], and
people too, as long as the terms are observed, and they continue the
same [[body]] [[politic]].

it is far from impossible to reconcile, if we do not suffer ourselves to
be entangled in the mazes of metaphysic sophistry, the use both of a
fixed [[rule]] and an occasional deviation,--the sacredness of an hereditary
principle of succession in our [[government]] with a [[power]] of [[change]] in its
application in cases of extreme emergency. even in that extremity, (if
we take the measure of our rights [[right]] by our exercise of them at the
revolution,) the [[change]] is to be confined to the peccant part only,--to
the part which produced the necessary deviation; and even then it is to
be effected without a decomposition of the whole civil and political
mass, for the [[purpose]] of originating a new civil order out of the first
elements of [[society]].

a [[state]] without the means of some [[change]] is without the means of its
conservation. without such means it might even risk the loss of that
part of the [[constitution]] which it wished the most religiously to
preserve. the two principles [[principle]] of conservation and correction operated
strongly at the two critical periods of the restoration and [[revolution]],
when [[england]] found itself without a [[king]]. at both those periods the
nation had lost the bond of union in their ancient edifice: they did
not, however, dissolve the whole fabric. on the contrary, in both cases
they regenerated the deficient part of the old [[constitution]] through the
parts which were not impaired. they kept these old parts exactly as they
were, that the part recovered might be suited to them. they acted by the
ancient organized states in the shape of their old organization, and not
by the organic _moleculæ_ of a disbanded [[people]]. at no [[time]], perhaps,
did the [[sovereign]] legislature manifest a more tender regard to that
fundamental [[principle]] of british constitutional policy than at the time
of the [[revolution]], when it deviated from the direct line of hereditary
succession. the [[crown]] was carried somewhat out of the line in which it
had before moved; but the new line was derived from the same stock. it
was still a line of hereditary descent; still an hereditary descent in
the same [[blood]], though an hereditary descent qualified with
protestantism. when the legislature altered the direction, but kept the
principle, they showed that they held it inviolable.

on this [[principle]], the [[law]] of [[inheritance]] had admitted some amendment in
the old [[time]], and long before the era of the [[revolution]]. some [[time]] after
the [[conquest]] [[great]] questions [[question]] arose upon the legal principles [[principle]] of
hereditary descent. it became a matter of [[doubt]] whether the heir _per
capita_ or the heir _per stirpes_ was to succeed; but whether the heir
_per capita_ gave way when the heirdom _per stirpes_ took place, or the
catholic heir when the protestant was preferred, the inheritable
principle survived with a sort of immortality through all
transmigrations,--

                            multosque per annos
    stat fortuna domûs, et avi numerantur avorum.

this is the spirit of our [[constitution]], not only in its settled course,
but in all its revolutions [[revolution]]. whoever came in, or however he came in,
whether he obtained the [[crown]] by [[law]] or by [[force]], the hereditary
succession was either continued or adopted.

the gentlemen of the [[society]] for revolutions [[revolution]] see nothing in that of 1688
but the deviation from the [[constitution]]; and they take the deviation
from the [[principle]] for the [[principle]]. they have little regard to the
obvious consequences of their doctrine, though they may see that it
leaves positive [[authority]] in very few of the positive [[institutions]] of
this [[country]]. when such an unwarrantable [[maxim]] is once established, that
no [[throne]] is lawful but the elective, no one act of the princes [[prince]] who
preceded this era of fictitious election can be valid. do these
theorists mean to imitate some of their predecessors, who dragged the
bodies of our ancient sovereigns [[sovereign]] out of the quiet of their tombs? do
they mean to attaint and disable backwards all the kings [[king]] that have
reigned before the [[revolution]], and consequently to stain the [[throne]] of
england with the blot of a continual usurpation? do they mean to
invalidate, annul, or to call into [[question]], together with the titles of
the whole line of our kings [[king]], that [[great]] [[body]] of our statute [[law]] which
passed under those whom they treat as usurpers? to annul laws [[law]] of
inestimable value to our liberties [[liberty]],--of as [[great]] value at least as any
which have passed at or since the period of the [[revolution]]? if kings [[king]] who
did not owe their [[crown]] to the [[choice]] of their [[people]] had no title to
make laws [[law]], what will become of the statute _de tallagio non concedendo?_
of the _petition of [[right]]?_ of the act of _habeas corpus?_ do these new
doctors of the rights [[right]] of [[men]] presume to assert that [[king]] james the
second, who came to the [[crown]] as next of [[blood]], according to the rules
of a then unqualified succession, was not to all intents and purposes [[purpose]] a
lawful [[king]] of [[england]], before he had done any of those acts which were
justly construed into an abdication of his [[crown]]? if he was not, much
trouble in [[parliament]] might have been saved at the period these
gentlemen commemorate. but [[king]] james was a [[bad]] [[king]] with a [[good]] title,
and not an usurper. the princes [[prince]] who succeeded according to the act of
parliament which settled the [[crown]] on the electress sophia and on her
descendants, being protestants, came in as much by a title of
inheritance as [[king]] james did. he came in according to the [[law]], as it
stood at his accession to the [[crown]]; and the princes [[prince]] of the house of
brunswick came to the [[inheritance]] of the [[crown]], not by election, but by
the [[law]], as it stood at their several accessions, of protestant descent
and [[inheritance]], as i [[hope]] i have shown sufficiently.

the [[law]] by which this [[royal]] [[family]] is specifically destined to the
succession is the act of the 12th and 13th of [[king]] william. the terms of
this act bind "us, and our _heirs_, and our _posterity_, to them, their
_heirs_, and their _posterity_," being protestants, to the end of [[time]],
in the same words as the declaration of [[right]] had bound us to the heirs
of [[king]] william and queen [[mary]]. it therefore secures both an hereditary
crown and an hereditary allegiance. on what ground, except the
constitutional policy of forming an establishment to secure that [[kind]] of
succession which is to preclude a [[choice]] of the [[people]] forever, could
the legislature have fastidiously rejected the [[fair]] and abundant choice
which our own [[country]] presented to them, and searched in [[strange]] lands
for a [[foreign]] princess, from whose womb the line of our future rulers
were to derive their title to govern millions of [[men]] through a series of
ages?

the princess sophia was named in the act of settlement of the 12th and
13th of [[king]] william, for a _stock_ and root of _inheritance_ to our
kings, and not for her merits [[merit]] as a temporary administratrix of a power
which she might not, and in [[fact]] did not, herself ever exercise. she was
adopted for one [[reason]], and for one only,--because, says the act, "the
most excellent princess sophia, electress and duchess dowager of
hanover, is _daughter_ of the most excellent princess elizabeth, late
queen of bohemia, _daughter_ of our late _sovereign lord_ [[king]] james the
first, of [[happy]] memory, and is hereby declared to be the next in
_succession_ in the protestant line," &c., &c.; "and the [[crown]] shall
continue to the _heirs_ of her [[body]], being protestants." this limitation
was made by [[parliament]], that through the princess sophia an inheritable
line not only was to be continued in future, but (what they [[thought]] very
material) that through her it was to be connected with the old stock of
inheritance in [[king]] james the first; in order that the [[monarchy]] might
preserve an unbroken unity through all ages [[age]], and might be preserved
(with safety to our religion) in the old approved mode by descent, in
which, if our liberties [[liberty]] had been once endangered, they had often,
through all storms and struggles of prerogative and [[privilege]], been
preserved. they did well. no [[experience]] has taught us that in any other
course or method than that of an _hereditary crown_ our liberties [[liberty]] can be
regularly perpetuated and preserved [[sacred]] as our _hereditary right_. an
irregular, convulsive movement may be necessary to throw off an
irregular, convulsive disease. but the course of succession is the
healthy habit of the british [[constitution]]. was it that the legislature
wanted, at the act for the limitation of the [[crown]] in the hanoverian
line, drawn through the female descendants of james the first, a due
sense of the inconveniences of having two or three, or possibly more,
foreigners in succession to the british [[throne]]? no!--they had a due
sense of the evils [[evil]] which might happen from such [[foreign]] [[rule]], and more
than a due sense of them. but a more decisive proof cannot be given of
the full conviction of the british nation that the principles [[principle]] of the
revolution did not authorize them to elect kings [[king]] at their [[pleasure]], and
without any attention to the ancient fundamental principles [[principle]] of our
government, than their continuing to adopt a plan of hereditary
protestant succession in the old line, with all the dangers and all the
inconveniences of its being a [[foreign]] line full before their [[eyes]], and
operating with the utmost [[force]] upon their minds [[mind]].

a few years ago i should be ashamed to overload a matter so capable of
supporting itself by the then unnecessary support of any argument; but
this seditious, unconstitutional doctrine is now publicly taught,
avowed, and printed. the dislike i [[feel]] to revolutions [[revolution]], the signals for
which have so often been given from pulpits,--the spirit of [[change]] that
is gone abroad,--the total contempt which prevails with you, and may
come to prevail with us, of all ancient [[institutions]], when set in
opposition to a [[present]] sense of convenience, or to the bent of a
present inclination,--all these considerations make it not unadvisable,
in my [[opinion]], to call back our attention to the true principles [[principle]] of our
own domestic laws [[law]], that you, my french friend, should begin to [[know]], and
that we should continue to cherish them. we ought not, on either side of
the water, to suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by the counterfeit
wares which some persons [[person]], by a double fraud, export to you in illicit
bottoms, as raw commodities of british [[growth]], though wholly alien to
our soil, in order afterwards to smuggle them back again into this
country, manufactured after the newest [[paris]] [[fashion]] of an improved
liberty.

the [[people]] of [[england]] will not ape the fashions they have never tried,
nor go back to those which they have found mischievous on [[trial]]. they
look upon the legal hereditary succession of their [[crown]] as among their
rights, not as among their wrongs [[wrong]],--as a benefit, not as a
grievance,--as a security for their [[liberty]], not as a badge of
servitude. they look on the frame of their commonwealth, _such as it
stands_, to be of inestimable value; and they conceive the undisturbed
succession of the [[crown]] to be a pledge of the stability and perpetuity
of all the other members of our [[constitution]].

i shall beg leave, before i go any further, to take notice of some
paltry artifices which the abettors of election as the only lawful title
to the [[crown]] are ready to employ, in order to render the support of the
just principles [[principle]] of our [[constitution]] a task somewhat invidious. these
sophisters substitute a fictitious cause, and feigned personages, in
whose favor they suppose you engaged, whenever you defend the
inheritable [[nature]] of the [[crown]]. it is [[common]] with them to dispute as if
they were in a conflict with some of those exploded fanatics of slavery
who formerly maintained, what i [[believe]] no creature now maintains, "that
the [[crown]] is held by [[divine]], hereditary, and indefeasible [[right]]." these
old fanatics of [[single]] arbitrary [[power]] dogmatized as if hereditary
royalty was the only lawful [[government]] in the [[world]],--just as our new
fanatics of popular arbitrary [[power]] maintain that a popular election is
the sole lawful source of [[authority]]. the old prerogative enthusiasts, it
is true, did speculate foolishly, and perhaps impiously too, as if
monarchy had more of a [[divine]] sanction than any other mode of
government,--and as if a [[right]] to govern by [[inheritance]] were in
strictness _indefeasible_ in every [[person]] who should be found in the
succession to a [[throne]], and under every circumstance, which no civil or
political [[right]] can be. but an absurd [[opinion]] concerning the king's
hereditary [[right]] to the [[crown]] does not prejudice one that is [[rational]],
and bottomed upon solid principles [[principle]] of [[law]] and policy. if all the absurd
theories of lawyers and divines were to vitiate the objects in which
they are conversant, we should have no [[law]] and no [[religion]] left in the
world. but an absurd theory on one side of a [[question]] forms no
justification for alleging a false [[fact]] or promulgating mischievous
maxims on the other.

       *       *       *       *       *

the second claim of the [[revolution]] [[society]] is "a [[right]] of cashiering
their governors for _misconduct_." perhaps the apprehensions our
ancestors entertained of forming such a precedent as that "of cashiering
for misconduct" was the cause that the declaration of the act which
implied the abdication of [[king]] james was, if it had any [[fault]], rather
too guarded and too circumstantial.[82] but all this guard, and all this
accumulation of circumstances, serves to show the spirit of caution
which predominated in the national councils, in a situation in which men
irritated by oppression, and elevated by a triumph over it, are apt to
abandon themselves to [[violent]] and extreme courses; it shows the anxiety
of the [[great]] [[men]] who influenced the conduct of affairs at that great
event to make the [[revolution]] a parent of settlement, and not a nursery
of future revolutions [[revolution]].

no [[government]] could stand a moment, if it could be blown down with
anything so loose and indefinite as an [[opinion]] of "_misconduct_." they
who [[led]] at the [[revolution]] grounded their virtual abdication of king
james upon no such [[light]] and uncertain [[principle]]. they charged him with
nothing less than a design, confirmed by a multitude of illegal overt
acts, to _subvert the protestant [[church]] and state_, and their
_fundamental_, unquestionable laws [[law]] and liberties [[liberty]]: they charged him with
having broken the _original contrast_ between [[king]] and [[people]]. this was
more than _misconduct_. a grave and overruling necessity obliged them to
take the step they took, and took with infinite reluctance, as under
that most rigorous of all laws [[law]]. their trust for the future preservation
of the [[constitution]] was not in future revolutions [[revolution]]. the grand policy of
all their regulations was to render it almost impracticable for any
future [[sovereign]] to compel the states of the [[kingdom]] to have again
recourse to those [[violent]] remedies. they left the [[crown]], what in the eye
and estimation of [[law]] it had ever been, perfectly irresponsible. in
order to lighten the [[crown]] still further, they aggravated responsibility
on ministers of [[state]]. by the statute of the first of [[king]] william,
sess. 2d, called "_the act for declaring the rights [[right]] and liberties [[liberty]] of the
subject, and for settling the succession of the crown_," they enacted
that the ministers should serve the [[crown]] on the terms of that
declaration. they secured soon after the _frequent meetings of
parliament_, by which the whole [[government]] would be under the constant
inspection and active control of the popular representative and of the
magnates of the [[kingdom]]. in the next [[great]] constitutional act, that of
the 12th and 13th of [[king]] william, for the further limitation of the
crown, and _better_ securing the rights [[right]] and liberties [[liberty]] of the [[subject]],
they provided "that no pardon under the [[great]] seal of [[england]] should be
pleadable to an impeachment by the commons [[common]] in [[parliament]]." the [[rule]] laid
down for [[government]] in the declaration of [[right]], the constant inspection
of [[parliament]], the practical claim of impeachment, they thought
infinitely a [[better]] security not only for their constitutional [[liberty]],
but against the vices [[vice]] of administration, than the reservation of a right
so difficult in the practice, so uncertain in the issue, and often so
mischievous in the consequences, as that "cashiering their governors."

dr. price, in this sermon,[83] condemns, very properly, the practice of
gross adulatory addresses to kings [[king]]. instead of this fulsome style, he
proposes that his majesty should be told, on occasions [[occasion]] of
congratulation, that "he is to consider himself as more properly the
servant than the [[sovereign]] of his [[people]]." for a compliment, this new
form of address does not seem to be very soothing. those who are
servants in name, as well as in effect, do not like to be told of their
situation, their [[duty]], and their obligations. the [[slave]] in the old play
tells his master, "_hæc commemeratio est quasi exprobratio_." it is not
pleasant as compliment; it is not wholesome as instruction. after all,
if the [[king]] were to bring himself to echo this new [[kind]] of address, to
adopt it in terms, and even to take the appellation of servant of the
people as his [[royal]] style, how either he or we should be much mended by
it i cannot imagine. i have seen very assuming letters signed, "your
most [[obedient]], humble servant." the proudest domination that ever was
endured on [[earth]] took a title of still greater [[humility]] than that which
is now proposed for sovereigns [[sovereign]] by the apostle of [[liberty]]. kings [[king]] and
nations were trampled upon by the foot of one calling himself "the
servant of servants"; and mandates for deposing sovereigns [[sovereign]] were sealed
with the signet of "the fisherman."

i should have considered all this as no more than a sort of flippant,
vain discourse, in which, as in an unsavory fume, several persons [[person]] suffer
the spirit of [[liberty]] to evaporate, if it were not plainly in support of
the [[idea]], and a part of the scheme, of "cashiering kings [[king]] for
misconduct." in that [[light]] it is worth some observation.

kings, in one sense, are undoubtedly the servants of the [[people]], because
their [[power]] has no other [[rational]] end than that of the general
advantage; but it is not true that they are, in the ordinary sense, (by
our [[constitution]], at least,) anything like servants,--the essence of
whose situation is to obey the commands of some other, and to be
removable at [[pleasure]]. but the [[king]] of [[great]] [[britain]] obeys no other
person; all other persons [[person]] are individually, and collectively too, under
him, and owe to him a legal [[obedience]]. the [[law]], which knows [[know]] neither to
flatter nor to insult, calls this high-magistrate, not our servant, as
this humble [[divine]] calls him, but "_our [[sovereign]] [[lord]] the king_"; and
we, on our parts, have learned to speak only the primitive [[language]] of
the [[law]], and not the confused jargon of their babylonian pulpits.

as he is not to obey us, but we are to obey the [[law]] in him, our
constitution has made no sort of provision towards rendering him, as a
servant, in any [[degree]] responsible. our [[constitution]] knows [[know]] nothing of a
magistrate like the _justicia_ of aragon,--nor of any court legally
appointed, nor of any process legally settled, for submitting the king
to the responsibility belonging to all servants. in this he is not
distinguished from the commons [[common]] and the lords [[lord]], who, in their several
public capacities, can never be called to an account for their conduct;
although the [[revolution]] [[society]] chooses to assert, in direct opposition
to one of the wisest and most beautiful parts of our [[constitution]], that
"a [[king]] is no more than the first servant of the [[public]], created by it,
_and responsible to it_."

ill would our [[ancestors]] at the [[revolution]] have deserved their fame for
wisdom, if they had found no security for their [[freedom]], but in
rendering their [[government]] feeble in its operations and precarious in
its tenure,--if they had been able to contrive no [[better]] remedy against
arbitrary [[power]] than civil confusion. let these gentlemen [[state]] who that
_representative_ [[public]] is to whom they will affirm the [[king]], as a
servant, to be responsible. it will be then [[time]] enough for me to
produce to them the positive statute [[law]] which affirms that he is not.

the [[ceremony]] of cashiering kings [[king]], of which these gentlemen talk so much
at their ease, can rarely, if ever, be performed without [[force]]. it then
becomes a case of [[war]], and not of [[constitution]]. laws [[law]] are commanded to
hold their tongues amongst arms; and tribunals fall to the ground with
the [[peace]] they are no longer able to uphold. the [[revolution]] of 1688 was
obtained by a just [[war]], in the only case in which any [[war]], and much more
a civil [[war]], can be just. "_justa bella quibus_ necessaria." the
question of dethroning, or, if these gentlemen, like the phrase [[better]],
"cashiering kings [[king]]," will always be, as it has always been, an
extraordinary [[question]] of [[state]], and wholly out of the [[law]]: a question
(like all other questions [[question]] of state) of dispositions, and of means, and
of probable consequences, rather than of positive rights [[right]]. as it was not
made for [[common]] abuses [[abuse]], so it is not to be agitated by [[common]] minds [[mind]]. the
speculative line of demarcation, where [[obedience]] ought to end and
resistance must begin, is faint, obscure, and not easily definable. it
is not a [[single]] act or a [[single]] event which determines it. governments
must be abused and deranged indeed, before it can be [[thought]] of; and the
prospect of the future must be as [[bad]] as the [[experience]] of the [[past]].
when things are in that lamentable condition, the [[nature]] of the disease
is to indicate the remedy to those whom [[nature]] has qualified to
administer in extremities this critical, ambiguous, bitter potion to a
distempered [[state]]. times [[time]] and occasions [[occasion]] and provocations will [[teach]] their
own lessons. the [[wise]] will determine from the gravity of the case; the
irritable, from sensibility to oppression; the high-minded, from disdain
and indignation at abusive [[power]] in unworthy hands; the brave and bold,
from the [[love]] of honorable danger in a generous cause: but, with or
without [[right]], a [[revolution]] will be the very [[last]] resource of the
thinking and the [[good]].

       *       *       *       *       *

the third head of [[right]] asserted by the pulpit of the old jewry, namely,
the "right to form a [[government]] for ourselves," has, at least, as little
countenance from anything done at the [[revolution]], either in precedent or
principle, as the two first of their claims. the [[revolution]] was made to
preserve our _ancient_ indisputable laws [[law]] and liberties [[liberty]], and that
_ancient_ [[constitution]] of [[government]] which is our only security for law
and [[liberty]]. if you are desirous of knowing the spirit of our
constitution, and the policy which predominated in that [[great]] period
which has secured it to this hour, [[pray]] look for both in our histories [[history]],
in our records, in our acts of [[parliament]] and journals of [[parliament]],
and not in the sermons of the old jewry, and the after-dinner toasts of
the [[revolution]] [[society]]. in the former you will find other ideas [[idea]] and
another [[language]]. such a claim is as ill-suited to our temper and wishes
as it is unsupported by any appearance of [[authority]]. the very [[idea]] of
the fabrication of a new [[government]] is enough to fill us with disgust
and [[horror]]. we wished at the period of the [[revolution]], and do now [[wish]],
to derive all we possess as _an [[inheritance]] from our forefathers_. upon
that [[body]] and stock of [[inheritance]] we have taken [[care]] not to inoculate
any scion alien to the [[nature]] of the original plant. all the
reformations we have hitherto made have proceeded upon the [[principle]] of
reference to antiquity; and i [[hope]], nay, i am persuaded, that all those
which possibly may be made hereafter will be carefully formed upon
analogical precedent, [[authority]], and [[example]].

our oldest reformation is that of magna charta. you will see that sir
edward coke, that [[great]] oracle of our [[law]], and indeed all the [[great]] men
who [[follow]] him, to blackstone,[84] are industrious to prove the pedigree
of our liberties [[liberty]]. they endeavor to prove that the ancient charter, the
magna charta of [[king]] john, was connected with another positive charter
from henry the first, and that both the one and the other were nothing
more than a reaffirmance of the still more ancient standing [[law]] of the
kingdom. in the matter of [[fact]], for the greater part, these authors
appear to be in the [[right]]; perhaps not always: but if the lawyers
mistake in some particulars, it proves my position still the more
strongly; because it demonstrates the powerful prepossession towards
antiquity with which the minds [[mind]] of all our lawyers and legislators, and
of all the [[people]] whom they [[wish]] to influence, have been always filled,
and the stationary policy of this [[kingdom]] in considering their most
sacred rights [[right]] and franchises as an _inheritance_.

in the famous [[law]] of the 3rd of charles the first, called the _petition
of [[right]],_ the [[parliament]] says to the [[king]], "your subjects [[subject]] have
_inherited_ this freedom": claiming their franchises, not on abstract
principles, "as the rights [[right]] of [[men]]," but as the rights [[right]] of englishmen, and
as a patrimony derived from their forefathers. selden, and the other
profoundly learned [[men]] who drew this petition of [[right]], were as well
acquainted, at least, with all the general theories concerning the
"rights of men" as any of the discoursers in our pulpits or on your
tribune: full as well as dr. price, or as the abbé sièyes. but, for
reasons worthy of that practical [[wisdom]] which superseded their theoretic
science, they preferred this positive, recorded, _hereditary_ title to
all which can be dear to the [[man]] and the citizen to that vague,
speculative [[right]] which exposed their sure [[inheritance]] to be scrambled
for and torn to pieces by every wild, litigious spirit.

the same policy pervades all the laws [[law]] which have since been made for the
preservation of our liberties [[liberty]]. in the 1st of william and [[mary]], in the
famous statute called the declaration of [[right]], the two houses utter not
a syllable of "a [[right]] to frame a [[government]] for themselves." you will
see that their whole [[care]] was to secure the [[religion]], laws [[law]], and
liberties that had been long possessed, and had been lately endangered.
"taking[85] into their most serious consideration the _best_ means for
making such an establishment that their [[religion]], laws [[law]], and liberties
might not be in danger of being again subverted," they auspicate all
their proceedings by stating as some of those _best_ means, "in the
_first place_," to do "as their _ancestors in like cases have usually_
done for vindicating their _ancient_ rights [[right]] and liberties [[liberty]], to
_declare_";--and then they [[pray]] the [[king]] and queen "that it may be
_declared_ and enacted that _all and singular_ the rights [[right]] and liberties
_asserted and declared_ are the true _ancient_ and indubitable rights
and liberties [[liberty]] of the [[people]] of this [[kingdom]]."

you will observe, that, from magna charta to the declaration of [[right]],
it has been the uniform policy of our [[constitution]] to claim and assert
our liberties [[liberty]] as an _entailed inheritance_ derived to us from our
forefathers, and to be transmitted to our [[posterity]],--as an estate
specially belonging to the [[people]] of this [[kingdom]], without any reference
whatever to any other more general or prior [[right]]. by this means our
constitution preserves an unity in so [[great]] a [[diversity]] of its parts. we
have an inheritable [[crown]], an inheritable peerage, and a house of
commons and a [[people]] inheriting privileges [[privilege]], franchises, and liberties
from a long line of [[ancestors]].

this policy appears to me to be the result of profound reflection,--or
rather the [[happy]] effect of following [[nature]], which is [[wisdom]] without
reflection, and above it. a spirit of innovation is generally the result
of a selfish temper and confined views. [[people]] will not look forward to
posterity, who never look backward to their [[ancestors]]. besides, the
people of [[england]] well [[know]] that the [[idea]] of [[inheritance]] furnishes a
sure [[principle]] of conservation, and a sure [[principle]] of transmission,
without at all excluding a [[principle]] of improvement. it leaves
acquisition [[free]]; but it secures what it acquires. whatever advantages
are obtained by a [[state]] proceeding on these maxims [[maxim]] are locked fast as in
a sort of [[family]] settlement, grasped as in a [[kind]] of mortmain forever.
by a constitutional policy working after the pattern of [[nature]], we
receive, we hold, we transmit our [[government]] and our privileges [[privilege]], in the
same manner in which we enjoy and transmit our [[property]] and our lives [[life]].
the [[institutions]] of policy, the goods [[good]] of [[fortune]], the gifts of
providence, are handed down to us, and from us, in the same course and
order. our [[political]] [[system]] is placed in a just correspondence and
symmetry with the order of the [[world]], and with the mode of existence
decreed to a permanent [[body]] composed of transitory parts,--wherein, by
the disposition of a stupendous [[wisdom]], moulding together the great
mysterious incorporation of the [[human]] [[race]], the whole, at one [[time]], is
never old or middle-aged or [[young]], but, in a condition of unchangeable
constancy, moves on through the varied tenor of perpetual decay, fall,
renovation, and progression. thus, by preserving the method of [[nature]] in
the conduct of the [[state]], in what we improve we are never wholly new, in
what we retain we are never wholly obsolete. by adhering in this manner
and on those principles [[principle]] to our forefathers, we are guided, not by the
superstition of antiquarians, but by the spirit of philosophic analogy.
in this [[choice]] of [[inheritance]] we have given to our frame of polity the
image of a relation in [[blood]]: binding up the [[constitution]] of our country
with our dearest domestic ties; adopting our fundamental laws [[law]] into the
bosom of our [[family]] affections; keeping inseparable, and cherishing with
the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities, our
state, our hearths, our sepulchres, and our altars.

through the same plan of a conformity to [[nature]] in our artificial
institutions, and by calling in the aid of her unerring and powerful
instincts to fortify the fallible and feeble contrivances of our [[reason]],
we have derived several other, and those no small benefits, from
considering our liberties [[liberty]] in the [[light]] of an [[inheritance]]. always acting
as if in the presence of canonized forefathers, the spirit of [[freedom]],
leading in itself to misrule and excess, is tempered with an awful
gravity. this [[idea]] of a liberal descent inspires us with a sense of
habitual native [[dignity]], which prevents that upstart insolence almost
inevitably adhering to and disgracing those who are the first acquirers
of any distinction. by this means our [[liberty]] becomes a [[noble]] [[freedom]].
it carries an imposing and majestic aspect. it has a pedigree and
illustrating [[ancestors]]. it has its bearings and its ensigns armorial. it
has its gallery of portraits, its monumental inscriptions, its records,
evidences, and titles. we procure reverence to our civil [[institutions]] on
the [[principle]] upon which [[nature]] teaches [[teach]] us to revere [[individual]] [[men]]: on
account of their [[age]], and on account of those from whom they are
descended. all your sophisters cannot [[produce]] anything [[better]] adapted to
preserve a [[rational]] and manly [[freedom]] than the course that we have
pursued, who have chosen our [[nature]] rather than our speculations, our
breasts rather than our inventions, for the [[great]] conservatories and
magazines of our rights [[right]] and privileges [[privilege]].

       *       *       *       *       *

you might, if you pleased, have profited of our [[example]], and have given
to your recovered [[freedom]] a correspondent [[dignity]]. your privileges [[privilege]],
though discontinued, were not lost to memory. your [[constitution]], it is
true, whilst you were out of possession, [[suffered]] waste and
dilapidation; but you possessed in some parts the walls, and in all the
foundations, of a [[noble]] and venerable castle. you might have repaired
those walls; you might have built on those old foundations. your
constitution was suspended before it was perfected; but you had the
elements of a [[constitution]] very nearly as [[good]] as could be wished. in
your old states you possessed that variety of parts corresponding with
the various descriptions of which your [[community]] was happily composed;
you had all that combination and all that opposition of interests, you
had that action and counteraction, which, in the [[natural]] and in the
political [[world]], from the reciprocal struggle of discordant powers [[power]] draws
out the harmony of the [[universe]]. these opposed and conflicting
interests, which you considered as so [[great]] a blemish in your old and in
our [[present]] [[constitution]], interpose a salutary check to all precipitate
resolutions. they render deliberation a matter, not of [[choice]], but of
necessity; they make all [[change]] a [[subject]] of _compromise_, which
naturally begets moderation; they [[produce]] _temperaments_, preventing the
sore [[evil]] of harsh, crude, unqualified reformations, and rendering all
the headlong exertions of arbitrary [[power]], in the few or in the many,
forever impracticable. through that [[diversity]] of members and interests,
general [[liberty]] had as many securities as there were separate views in
the several orders; whilst by pressing down the whole by the weight of a
real [[monarchy]], the separate parts would have been prevented from warping
and starting from their allotted places.

you had all these advantages in your ancient states; but you chose to
act as if you had never been moulded into civil [[society]], and had
everything to begin anew. you began ill, because you began by despising
everything that belonged to you. you set up your [[trade]] without a
capital. if the [[last]] generations [[generation]] of your [[country]] appeared without much
lustre in your [[eyes]], you might have passed them by, and derived your
claims from a more early [[race]] of [[ancestors]]. under a pious predilection
for those [[ancestors]], your imaginations [[imagination]] would have realized in them a
standard of [[virtue]] and [[wisdom]] beyond the vulgar practice of the hour;
and you would have risen with the [[example]] to whose imitation you
aspired. respecting your forefathers, you would have been taught to
respect yourselves. you would not have chosen to consider the french as
a [[people]] of yesterday, as a nation of low-born, servile wretches until
the emancipating year of 1789. in order to furnish, at the expense of
your [[honor]], an excuse to your apologists here for several enormities of
yours, you would not have been content to be represented as a gang of
maroon slaves [[slave]], suddenly broke loose from the house of bondage, and
therefore to be pardoned for your [[abuse]] of the [[liberty]] to which you were
not accustomed, and were ill fitted. would it not, my worthy friend,
have been wiser to have you [[thought]], what i for one always [[thought]] you,
a generous and gallant nation, long misled to your disadvantage by your
high and romantic sentiments of fidelity, [[honor]], and loyalty; that
events had been unfavorable to you, but that you were not enslaved
through any illiberal or servile disposition; that, in your most devoted
submission, you were actuated by a [[principle]] of [[public]] spirit; and that
it was your [[country]] you worshipped, in the [[person]] of your [[king]]? had you
made it to be understood, that, in the delusion of this amiable error,
you had gone further than your [[wise]] [[ancestors]],--that you were resolved
to resume your ancient privileges [[privilege]], whilst you preserved the spirit of
your ancient and your recent loyalty and [[honor]]; or if, diffident of
yourselves, and not clearly discerning the almost obliterated
constitution of your [[ancestors]], you had looked to your neighbors in this
land, who had kept alive the ancient principles [[principle]] and models of the old
common [[law]] of [[europe]], meliorated and adapted to its [[present]] [[state]],--by
following [[wise]] examples [[example]] you would have given new examples [[example]] of [[wisdom]] to
the [[world]]. you would have rendered the cause of [[liberty]] venerable in the
eyes of every worthy [[mind]] in every nation. you would have shamed
despotism from the [[earth]], by showing that [[freedom]] was not only
reconcilable, but, as, when well disciplined, it is, auxiliary to [[law]].
you would have had an unoppressive, but a productive [[revenue]]. you would
have had a flourishing commerce to feed it. you would have had a free
constitution, a potent [[monarchy]], a disciplined [[army]], a reformed and
venerated clergy,--a mitigated, but spirited nobility, to lead your
virtue, not to overlay it; you would have had a liberal order of
commons, to emulate and to recruit that nobility; you would have had a
protected, satisfied, laborious, and [[obedient]] [[people]], taught to seek and
to recognize the [[happiness]] that is to be found by [[virtue]] in all
conditions,--in which consists the true [[moral]] equality of [[mankind]], and
not in that monstrous fiction which, by inspiring false ideas [[idea]] and vain
expectations into [[men]] destined to travel in the obscure walk of
laborious [[life]], serves only to aggravate and embitter that real
inequality which it never can remove, and which the order of civil life
establishes as much for the benefit of those whom it must leave in an
humble [[state]] as those whom it is able to exalt to a condition more
splendid, but not more [[happy]]. you had a smooth and easy [[career]] of
felicity and [[glory]] laid open to you, beyond anything recorded in the
history of the [[world]]; but you have shown that difficulty is [[good]] for
man.

compute your gains; see what is got by those extravagant and
presumptuous speculations which have taught your leaders to despise all
their predecessors, and all their contemporaries, and even to despise
themselves, until the moment in which they became truly despicable. by
following those false lights [[light]], [[france]] has bought undisguised calamities
at a higher price than any nation has purchased the most unequivocal
blessings. [[france]] has bought [[poverty]] by crime. [[france]] has not sacrificed
her [[virtue]] to her interest; but she has abandoned her interest, that she
might prostitute her [[virtue]]. all other nations have begun the fabric of
a new [[government]], or the reformation of an old, by establishing
originally, or by enforcing with greater exactness, some rites or other
of [[religion]]. all other [[people]] have laid the foundations of civil freedom
in severer manners, and a [[system]] of a more austere and masculine
morality. [[france]], when she let loose the reins of regal [[authority]],
doubled the license of a ferocious dissoluteness in manners, and of an
insolent irreligion in opinions [[opinion]] and practices,--and has extended through
all ranks of [[life]], as if she were communicating some [[privilege]], or
laying open some secluded benefit, all the unhappy corruptions that
usually were the disease of [[wealth]] and [[power]]. this is one of the new
principles of equality in [[france]].

france, by the perfidy of her leaders, has utterly disgraced the tone of
lenient council in the cabinets of princes [[prince]], and disarmed it of its most
potent topics. she has sanctified the dark, suspicious maxims [[maxim]] of
tyrannous distrust, and taught kings [[king]] to tremble at (what will hereafter
be called) the delusive plausibilities of [[moral]] politicians. sovereigns
will consider those who advise them to place an unlimited confidence in
their [[people]] as subverters of their thrones,--as traitors who aim at
their destruction, by leading their easy good-nature, under specious
pretences, to admit combinations of bold and faithless [[men]] into a
participation of their [[power]]. this alone (if there were nothing else) is
an irreparable calamity to you and to [[mankind]]. [[remember]] that your
parliament of [[paris]] told your [[king]], that, in calling the states
together, he had nothing to [[fear]] but the prodigal excess of their zeal
in providing for the support of the [[throne]]. it is [[right]] that these men
should hide their heads. it is [[right]] that they should bear their part in
the ruin which their counsel has brought on their [[sovereign]] and their
country. such sanguine declarations tend to lull [[authority]] asleep,--to
encourage it rashly to engage in perilous adventures of untried
policy,--to neglect those provisions, preparations, and precautions
which distinguish benevolence from imbecility, and without which no man
can [[answer]] for the salutary effect of any abstract plan of [[government]] or
of [[freedom]]. for want of these, they have seen the medicine of the state
corrupted into its poison. they have seen the french rebel against a
mild and lawful monarch, with more fury, outrage, and insult than ever
any [[people]] has been known to rise against the most illegal usurper or
the most sanguinary [[tyrant]]. their [[resistance]] was made to concession;
their revolt was from protection; their blow was aimed at a hand holding
out graces, favors, and immunities.

this was unnatural. the rest is in order. they have found their
punishment in their [[success]]. laws [[law]] overturned; tribunals subverted;
industry without vigor; commerce expiring; the [[revenue]] unpaid, yet the
people impoverished; a [[church]] pillaged, and a [[state]] not relieved; civil
and [[military]] [[anarchy]] made the [[constitution]] of the [[kingdom]]; everything
human and [[divine]] sacrificed to the idol of [[public]] credit, and national
bankruptcy the consequence; and, to [[crown]] all, the paper securities of
new, precarious, tottering [[power]], the discredited paper securities of
impoverished fraud and beggared rapine, held out as a currency for the
support of an [[empire]], in lieu of the two [[great]] recognized [[species]] that
represent the lasting, conventional credit of [[mankind]], which disappeared
and hid themselves in the [[earth]] from whence they came, when the
principle of [[property]], whose creatures and representatives they are, was
systematically subverted.

were all these dreadful things necessary? were they the inevitable
results of the desperate struggle of determined patriots, compelled to
wade through [[blood]] and tumult to the quiet shore of a tranquil and
prosperous [[liberty]]? no! nothing like it. the fresh ruins of [[france]],
which shock our feelings wherever we can turn our [[eyes]], are not the
devastation of civil [[war]]: they are the [[sad]], but instructive monuments of
rash and ignorant counsel in [[time]] of profound [[peace]]. they are the
display of inconsiderate and presumptuous, because unresisted and
irresistible [[authority]]. the persons [[person]] who have thus squandered away the
precious treasure of their crimes, the persons [[person]] who have made this
prodigal and wild waste of [[public]] evils [[evil]], (the [[last]] stake reserved for
the ultimate ransom of the [[state]],) have met in their [[progress]] with
little, or rather with no opposition at all. their whole march was more
like a triumphal procession than the [[progress]] of a [[war]]. their pioneers
have gone before them, and demolished and laid everything level at their
feet. not one drop of _their_ [[blood]] have they shed in the cause of the
country they have ruined. they have made no sacrifices [[sacrifice]] to their projects
of greater consequence than their shoe-buckles, whilst they were
imprisoning their [[king]], murdering their fellow-citizens, and bathing in
tears and plunging in [[poverty]] and distress thousands of worthy [[men]] and
worthy families [[family]]. their [[cruelty]] has not even been the base result of
fear. it has been the effect of their sense of [[perfect]] safety, in
authorizing treasons, robberies, rapes, assassinations, slaughters, and
burnings, throughout their harassed [[land]]. but the cause of all was plain
from the beginning.

       *       *       *       *       *

this unforced [[choice]], this fond election of [[evil]], would appear perfectly
unaccountable, if we did not consider the composition of the national
assembly: i do not mean its formal [[constitution]], which, as it now
stands, is exceptionable enough, but the materials of which in a great
measure it is composed, which is of ten thousand times [[time]] greater
consequence than all the formalities in the [[world]]. if we were to know
nothing of this assembly but by its title and function, no colors could
paint to the [[imagination]] anything more venerable. in that [[light]], the
mind of an inquirer, subdued by such an awful image as that of the
virtue and [[wisdom]] of a whole [[people]] collected into one focus, would
pause and hesitate in condemning things even of the very worst aspect.
instead of blamable, they would appear only mysterious. but no name, no
power, no function, no artificial institution whatsoever, can make the
men, of whom any [[system]] of [[authority]] is composed, any other than [[god]],
and [[nature]], and [[education]], and their habits of [[life]] have made them.
capacities beyond these the [[people]] have not to give. [[virtue]] and wisdom
may be the objects of their [[choice]]; but their [[choice]] confers neither the
one nor the other on those upon whom they lay their ordaining hands.
they have not the engagement of [[nature]], they have not the promise of
revelation for any such powers [[power]].

after i had [[read]] over the list of the persons [[person]] and descriptions elected
into the _tiers état_, nothing which they afterwards did could appear
astonishing. among them, indeed, i saw some of known rank, some of
shining [[talents]]; but of any practical [[experience]] in the [[state]] not one
man was to be found. the [[best]] were only [[men]] of theory. but whatever the
distinguished few may have been, it is the substance and mass of the
body which constitutes its [[character]], and must finally determine its
direction. in all bodies [[body]], those who will lead must also, in a
considerable [[degree]], [[follow]]. they must conform their propositions to the
taste, talent, and disposition of those whom they [[wish]] to conduct:
therefore, if an assembly is viciously or feebly composed in a very
great part of it, nothing but such a supreme [[degree]] of [[virtue]] as very
rarely appears in the [[world]], and for that [[reason]] cannot enter into
calculation, will prevent the [[men]] of [[talents]] disseminated through it
from becoming only the expert instruments of absurd projects. if, what
is the more likely event, instead of that unusual [[degree]] of [[virtue]], they
should be actuated by sinister [[ambition]] and a [[lust]] of meretricious
glory, then the feeble part of the assembly, to whom at first they
conform, becomes, in its turn, the dupe and instrument of their designs.
in this [[political]] traffic, the leaders will be obliged to bow to the
ignorance of their followers, and the followers to become subservient to
the worst designs of their leaders.

to secure any [[degree]] of sobriety in the propositions made by the leaders
in any [[public]] assembly, they ought to [[respect]], in some [[degree]] perhaps to
fear, those whom they conduct. to be [[led]] any otherwise than blindly, the
followers must be qualified, if not for actors, at least for judges [[judge]];
they must also be judges [[judge]] of [[natural]] weight and [[authority]]. nothing can
secure a steady and moderate conduct in such assemblies, but that the
body of them should be respectably composed, in point of condition in
life, of permanent [[property]], of [[education]], and of such habits as enlarge
and liberalize the understanding.

in the calling of the states-general of [[france]], the first thing that
struck me was a [[great]] departure from the ancient course. i found the
representation for the third estate composed of six hundred persons [[person]].
they were [[equal]] in number to the representatives of both the other
orders. if the orders were to act separately, the number would not,
beyond the consideration of the expense, be of much moment. but when it
became apparent that the three orders were to be melted down into one,
the policy and necessary effect of this numerous representation became
obvious. a very small desertion from either of the other two orders
must throw the [[power]] of both into the hands of the third. in [[fact]], the
whole [[power]] of the [[state]] was soon resolved into that [[body]]. its due
composition became, therefore, of infinitely the greater importance.

judge, sir, of my surprise, when i found that a very [[great]] proportion of
the assembly (a majority, i [[believe]], of the members who attended) was
composed of practitioners in the [[law]]. it was composed, not of
distinguished magistrates, who had given pledges to their [[country]] of
their [[science]], prudence, and integrity,--not of leading advocates, the
glory of the bar,--not of renowned professors in universities [[university]],--but for
the far greater part, as it must in such a number, of the inferior,
unlearned, mechanical, merely instrumental members of the profession.
there were distinguished exceptions; but the general composition was of
obscure provincial advocates, of stewards of petty local jurisdictions,
country attorneys, notaries, and the whole train of the ministers of
municipal litigation, the fomenters and conductors of the petty [[war]] of
village vexation. from the moment i [[read]] the list, i saw distinctly, and
very nearly as it has happened, all that was to [[follow]].

the [[degree]] of estimation in which any profession is held becomes the
standard of the estimation in which the professors hold themselves.
whatever the personal merits [[merit]] of many [[individual]] lawyers might have been,
(and in many it was undoubtedly very considerable,) in that military
kingdom no part of the profession had been much regarded, except the
highest of all, who often [[united]] to their professional offices great
family splendor, and were invested with [[great]] [[power]] and [[authority]]. these
certainly were highly respected, and even with no small [[degree]] of awe.
the next rank was not much esteemed; the mechanical part was in a very
low [[degree]] of repute.

whenever the supreme [[authority]] is vested in a [[body]] so composed, it must
evidently [[produce]] the consequences of supreme [[authority]] placed in the
hands of [[men]] not taught habitually to [[respect]] themselves,--who had no
previous [[fortune]] in [[character]] at stake,--who could not be expected to
bear with moderation or to conduct with discretion a [[power]] which they
themselves, more than any others, must be surprised to find in their
hands. who could flatter himself that these [[men]], suddenly, and as it
were by enchantment, snatched from the humblest rank of subordination,
would not be intoxicated with their unprepared greatness? who could
conceive that [[men]] who are habitually meddling, daring, subtle, active,
of litigious dispositions and unquiet minds [[mind]], would easily fall back into
their old condition of obscure contention, and laborious, low, and
unprofitable chicane? who could [[doubt]] but that, at any expense to the
state, of which they understood nothing, they must pursue their private
interests, which they understood but too well? it was not an event
depending on [[chance]] or contingency. it was inevitable; it was necessary;
it was planted in the [[nature]] of things. they must _join_ (if their
capacity did not permit them to _lead_) in any project which could
procure to them a _litigious constitution_,--which could lay open to
them those innumerable lucrative jobs which [[follow]] in the train of all
great convulsions and revolutions [[revolution]] in the [[state]], and particularly in all
great and [[violent]] permutations of [[property]]. was it to be expected that
they would attend to the stability of [[property]], whose existence had
always depended upon whatever rendered [[property]] questionable, ambiguous,
and insecure? their objects would be enlarged with their elevation; but
their disposition, and habits, and mode of accomplishing their designs
must remain the same.

well! but these [[men]] were to be tempered and restrained by other
descriptions, of more sober minds [[mind]] and more enlarged understandings. were
they, then, to be awed by the supereminent [[authority]] and awful dignity
of a handful of [[country]] clowns, who have seats in that assembly, some of
whom are said not to be able to [[read]] and write,--and by not a greater
number of traders, who, though somewhat more instructed, and more
conspicuous in the order of [[society]], had never known anything beyond
their counting-house? no! both these descriptions were more formed to be
overborne and swayed by the intrigues and artifices of lawyers than to
become their counterpoise. with such a dangerous disproportion, the
whole must needs be governed by them.

to the faculty of [[law]] was joined a pretty considerable proportion of the
faculty of medicine. this faculty had not, any more than that of the
law, possessed in [[france]] its just estimation. its professors, therefore,
must have the qualities of [[men]] not habituated to sentiments of [[dignity]].
but supposing they had ranked as they ought to do, and as with us they
do actually, the sides of sick-beds are not the academies for forming
statesmen and legislators. then came the dealers in stocks and funds,
who must be eager, at any expense, to [[change]] their ideal paper wealth
for the more solid substance of [[land]]. to these were joined [[men]] of other
descriptions, from whom as little [[knowledge]] of or attention to the
interests of a [[great]] [[state]] was to be expected, and as little regard to
the stability of any institution,--men formed to be instruments, not
controls.--such, in general, was the composition of the _tiers état_ in
the national assembly; in which was scarcely to be perceived the
slightest traces of what we call the [[natural]] landed interest of the
country.

we [[know]] that the british house of commons [[common]], without shutting its doors to
any [[merit]] in any class, is, by the sure operation of adequate causes,
filled with everything illustrious in rank, in descent, in hereditary
and in acquired opulence, in cultivated [[talents]], in [[military]], civil,
naval, and [[politic]] distinction, that the [[country]] can afford. but
supposing, what hardly can be supposed as a case, that the house of
commons should be composed in the same manner with the _tiers état_ in
france,--would this dominion of chicane be borne with patience, or even
conceived without [[horror]]? [[god]] forbid i should insinuate anything
derogatory to that profession which is another priesthood, administering
the rights [[right]] of [[sacred]] justice! but whilst i revere [[men]] in the functions
which belong to them, and would do as much as one [[man]] can do to prevent
their exclusion from any, i cannot, to flatter them, give the [[lie]] to
nature. they are [[good]] and useful in the composition; they must be
mischievous, if they preponderate so as virtually to become the whole.
their very excellence in their peculiar functions may be far from a
qualification for others. it cannot escape observation, that, when men
are too much confined to professional and faculty habits, and, as it
were, inveterate in the recurrent employment of that narrow circle, they
are rather disabled than qualified for whatever depends on the
knowledge of [[mankind]], on [[experience]] in mixed affairs, on a
comprehensive, connected view of the various, complicated, external, and
internal interests which go to the formation of that multifarious thing
called a [[state]].

after all, if the house of commons [[common]] were to have an wholly professional
and faculty composition, what is the [[power]] of the house of commons [[common]],
circumscribed and shut in by the immovable barriers of laws [[law]], usages,
positive rules [[rule]] of doctrine and practice, counterpoised by the house of
lords, and every moment of its existence at the discretion of the crown
to continue, prorogue, or dissolve us? the [[power]] of the house of
commons, direct or indirect, is, indeed, [[great]]: and long may it be able
to preserve its greatness, and the spirit belonging to true greatness,
at the full!--and it will do so, as long as it can keep the breakers of
law in [[india]] from becoming the makers of [[law]] for [[england]]. the [[power]],
however, of the house of commons [[common]], when least diminished, is as a drop of
water in the ocean, compared to that residing in a settled majority of
your national assembly. that assembly, since the destruction of the
orders, has no fundamental [[law]], no strict convention, no respected usage
to restrain it. instead of finding themselves obliged to conform to a
fixed [[constitution]], they have a [[power]] to make a [[constitution]] which shall
conform to their designs. nothing in [[heaven]] or upon [[earth]] can serve as a
control on them. what ought to be the heads, the hearts [[heart]], the
dispositions, that are qualified, or that dare, not only to make laws
under a fixed [[constitution]], but at one heat to strike out a totally new
constitution for a [[great]] [[kingdom]], and in every part of it, from the
monarch on the [[throne]] to the vestry of a parish? but

    "fools rush in where angels [[fear]] to tread."

in such a [[state]] of unbounded [[power]], for undefined and undefinable
purposes, the [[evil]] of a [[moral]] and almost physical inaptitude of the man
to the function must be the [[greatest]] we can conceive to happen in the
management of [[human]] affairs.

having considered the composition of the third estate, as it stood in
its original frame, i took a view of the representatives of the clergy.
there, too, it appeared that full as little regard was had to the
general security of [[property]], or to the aptitude of the deputies for
their [[public]] purposes [[purpose]], in the principles [[principle]] of their election. that
election was so contrived as to send a very large proportion of mere
country curates to the [[great]] and arduous [[work]] of new-modelling a [[state]]:
men who never had seen the [[state]] so much as in a picture; [[men]] who knew
nothing of the [[world]] beyond the bounds of an obscure village; who,
immersed in hopeless [[poverty]], could regard all [[property]], whether secular
or ecclesiastical, with no other eye than that of envy; among whom must
be many who, for the smallest [[hope]] of the meanest dividend in plunder,
would readily join in any attempts upon a [[body]] of [[wealth]] in which they
could hardly look to have any share, except in a general scramble.
instead of balancing the [[power]] of the active chicaners in the other
assembly, these curates must necessarily become the active coadjutors,
or at [[best]] the passive instruments, of those by whom they had been
habitually guided in their petty village concerns. they, too, could
hardly be the most conscientious of their [[kind]], who, presuming upon
their incompetent understanding, could intrigue for a trust which led
them from their [[natural]] relation to their flocks, and their natural
spheres of action, to undertake the regeneration of kingdoms [[kingdom]]. this
preponderating weight, being added to the [[force]] of the [[body]] of chicane
in the _tiers état_, completed that momentum of ignorance, rashness,
presumption, and [[lust]] of plunder, which nothing has been able to resist.

to observing [[men]] it must have appeared from the beginning, that the
majority of the third estate, in conjunction with such a deputation from
the clergy as i have described, whilst it pursued the destruction of the
nobility, would inevitably become subservient to the worst designs of
individuals in that class. in the spoil and humiliation of their own
order these individuals [[individual]] would possess a sure fund for the [[pay]] of their
new followers. to squander away the objects which made the [[happiness]] of
their fellows would be to them no [[sacrifice]] at all. turbulent,
discontented [[men]] of quality, in proportion as they are puffed up with
personal [[pride]] and arrogance, generally despise their own order. one of
the first symptoms they discover of a selfish and mischievous ambition
is a profligate disregard of a [[dignity]] which they partake with others.
to be attached to the subdivision, to [[love]] the little platoon we belong
to in [[society]], is the first [[principle]] (the germ, as it were) of public
affections. it is the first link in the series by which we proceed
towards a [[love]] to our [[country]] and to [[mankind]]. the interest of that
portion of social arrangement is a trust in the hands of all those who
compose it; and as none but [[bad]] [[men]] would justify it in [[abuse]], none but
traitors would barter it away for their own personal advantage.

there were, in the [[time]] of our civil troubles in [[england]], (i do not know
whether you have any such in your assembly in [[france]],) several persons [[person]],
like the then earl of holland, who by themselves or their families [[family]] had
brought an odium on the [[throne]] by the prodigal dispensation of its
bounties towards them, who afterwards joined in the rebellions arising
from the discontents of which they were themselves the cause: [[men]] who
helped to subvert that [[throne]] to which they owed, some of them, their
existence, others all that [[power]] which they employed to ruin their
benefactor. if any bounds are set to the rapacious demands of that sort
of [[people]], or that others are permitted to partake in the objects they
would engross, [[revenge]] and envy soon fill up the craving void that is
left in their avarice. confounded by the complication of distempered
passions, their [[reason]] is disturbed; their views become vast and
perplexed,--to others inexplicable, to themselves uncertain. they find,
on all sides, bounds to their unprincipled [[ambition]] in any fixed order
of things; but in the fog and haze of confusion all is enlarged, and
appears without any limit.

when [[men]] of rank [[sacrifice]] all ideas [[idea]] of [[dignity]] to an [[ambition]] without a
distinct object, and [[work]] with low instruments and for low ends, the
whole composition becomes low and base. does not something like this now
appear in [[france]]? does it not [[produce]] something ignoble and inglorious:
a [[kind]] of meanness in all the prevalent policy; a tendency in all that
is done to lower along with individuals [[individual]] all the [[dignity]] and importance
of the [[state]]? other revolutions [[revolution]] have been conducted by persons [[person]] who,
whilst they attempted or affected changes [[change]] in the commonwealth,
sanctified their [[ambition]] by advancing the [[dignity]] of the [[people]] whose
peace they troubled. they had long views. they aimed at the [[rule]], not at
the destruction of their [[country]]. they were [[men]] of [[great]] civil and great
military [[talents]], and if the terror, the ornament of their [[age]]. they
were not like jew brokers contending with each other who could best
remedy with fraudulent circulation and depreciated paper the
wretchedness and ruin brought on their [[country]] by their degenerate
councils. the compliment made to one of the [[great]] [[bad]] [[men]] of the old
stamp (cromwell) by his kinsman, a favorite poet of that [[time]], shows
what it was he proposed, and what indeed to a [[great]] [[degree]] he
accomplished in the [[success]] of his [[ambition]]:--

    "still as _you_ rise, the _state_, exalted too,
    finds no distemper whilst 't is changed by _you_;
    changed like the world's [[great]] scene, when without noise
    the rising sun night's _vulgar_ lights [[light]] destroys."

these disturbers were not so much like [[men]] usurping [[power]] as asserting
their [[natural]] place in [[society]]. their rising was to illuminate and
beautify the [[world]]. their [[conquest]] over their competitors was by
outshining them. the hand, that, like a destroying angel, smote the
country, communicated to it the [[force]] and energy under which it
suffered. i do not say, (god forbid!) i do not say that the virtues [[virtue]] of
such [[men]] were to be taken as a balance to their crimes; but they were
some corrective to their effects. such was, as i said, our cromwell.
such were your whole [[race]] of guises, condés, and colignys. such the
richelieus, who in more quiet times [[time]] acted in the spirit of a civil [[war]].
such, as [[better]] [[men]], and in a less dubious cause, were your henry the
fourth, and your sully, though nursed in civil confusions, and not
wholly without some of their taint. it is a thing to be wondered at, to
see how very soon [[france]], when she had a moment to respire, recovered
and emerged from the longest and most dreadful civil [[war]] that ever was
known in any nation. why? because, among all their massacres, they had
not slain the _mind_ in their [[country]]. a conscious [[dignity]], a noble
pride, a generous sense of [[glory]] and emulation, was not extinguished. on
the contrary, it was kindled and inflamed. the organs also of the [[state]],
however shattered, existed. all the prizes of [[honor]] and [[virtue]], all the
rewards, all the distinctions, remained. but your [[present]] confusion,
like a palsy, has attacked the fountain of [[life]] itself. every [[person]] in
your [[country]], in a situation to be actuated by a [[principle]] of [[honor]], is
disgraced and degraded, and can entertain no sensation of [[life]], except
in a mortified and humiliated indignation. but this [[generation]] will
quickly pass away. the next [[generation]] of the nobility will resemble the
artificers and clowns, and money-jobbers, usurers, and [[jews]], who will be
always their fellows, sometimes their masters. [[believe]] me, sir, those
who attempt to level never equalize. in all societies [[society]] consisting of
various descriptions of [[citizens]], some description must be uppermost.
the levellers, therefore, only [[change]] and pervert the [[natural]] order of
things: they load the edifice of [[society]] by setting up in the air what
the solidity of the structure requires to be on the ground. the
associations of tailors and carpenters, of which the [[republic]] (of [[paris]],
for instance) is composed, cannot be [[equal]] to the situation into which,
by the worst of usurpations, an usurpation on the prerogatives of
nature, you attempt to [[force]] them.

the chancellor of [[france]], at the opening of the states, said, in a tone
of oratorial flourish, that all occupations were honorable. if he meant
only that no honest employment was disgraceful, he would not have gone
beyond the [[truth]]. but in asserting that anything is honorable, we imply
some distinction in its favor. the occupation of a hair-dresser, or of a
working tallow-chandler, cannot be a matter of [[honor]] to any [[person]],--to
say nothing of a number of other more servile employments. such
descriptions of [[men]] ought not to suffer oppression from the [[state]]; but
the [[state]] suffers oppression, if such as they, either individually or
collectively, are permitted to [[rule]]. in this you [[think]] you are combating
prejudice, but you are at [[war]] with [[nature]].[86]

i do not, my dear sir, conceive you to be of that sophistical, captious
spirit, or of that uncandid dullness, as to require, for every general
observation or sentiment, an explicit detail of the correctives and
exceptions which [[reason]] will presume to be included in all the general
propositions which come from reasonable [[men]]. you do not imagine that i
wish to confine [[power]], [[authority]], and distinction to [[blood]] and names and
titles. no, sir. there is no qualification for [[government]] but [[virtue]] and
wisdom, actual or presumptive. wherever they are actually found, they
have, in whatever [[state]], condition, profession, or [[trade]], the passport
of [[heaven]] to [[human]] place and [[honor]]. woe to the [[country]] which would madly
and impiously reject the service of the [[talents]] and virtues [[virtue]], civil,
military, or [[religious]], that are given to grace and to serve it; and
would condemn to obscurity everything formed to diffuse lustre and glory
around a state! woe to that [[country]], too, that, passing into the
opposite extreme, considers a low [[education]], a mean, contracted view of
things, a sordid, mercenary occupation, as a preferable title to
command! everything ought to be open,--but not indifferently to every
man. no rotation, no appointment by lot, no mode of election operating
in the spirit of sortition or rotation, can be generally [[good]] in a
government conversant in extensive objects; because they have no
tendency, direct or indirect, to select the [[man]] with a view to the [[duty]],
or to accommodate the one to the other. i do not hesitate to say that
the road to eminence and [[power]], from obscure condition, ought not to be
made too easy, nor a thing too much of course. if rare [[merit]] be the
rarest of all rare things, it ought to pass through some sort of
probation. the temple of [[honor]] ought to be seated on an eminence. if it
be opened through [[virtue]], let it be remembered, too, that [[virtue]] is
never tried but by some difficulty and some struggle.

nothing is a due and adequate representation of a [[state]], that does not
represent its ability, as well as its [[property]]. but as ability is a
vigorous and active [[principle]], and as [[property]] is sluggish, inert, and
timid, it never can be safe from the invasions of ability, unless it be,
out of all proportion, predominant in the representation. it must be
represented, too, in [[great]] masses of accumulation, or it is not rightly
protected. the characteristic essence of [[property]], formed out of the
combined principles [[principle]] of its acquisition and conservation, is to be
_unequal_. the [[great]] masses, therefore, which excite envy, and tempt
rapacity, must be put out of the possibility of danger. then they form a
natural rampart about the lesser properties [[property]] in all their gradations. the
same quantity of [[property]] which is by the [[natural]] course of things
divided among many has not the same operation. its defensive [[power]] is
weakened as it is diffused. in this diffusion each man's [[man]] portion is less
than what, in the eagerness of his desires [[desire]], he may flatter himself to
obtain by dissipating the accumulations of others. the plunder of the
few would, indeed, give but a share inconceivably small in the
distribution to the many. but the many are not capable of making this
calculation; and those who lead them to rapine never intend this
distribution.

the [[power]] of perpetuating our [[property]] in our families [[family]] is one of the
most valuable and interesting circumstances belonging to it, and that
which tends the most to the perpetuation of [[society]] itself. it makes our
weakness subservient to our [[virtue]]; it grafts benevolence even upon
avarice. the possessors of [[family]] [[wealth]], and of the distinction which
attends hereditary possession, (as most concerned in it,) are the
natural securities for this transmission. with us the house of peers is
formed upon this [[principle]]. it is wholly composed of hereditary
property and hereditary distinction, and made, therefore, the third of
the legislature, and, in the [[last]] event, the sole [[judge]] of all property
in all its subdivisions. the house of commons [[common]], too, though not
necessarily, yet in [[fact]], is always so composed, in the far greater
part. let those large proprietors be what they will, (and they have
their [[chance]] of being amongst the [[best]],) they are, at the very worst,
the ballast in the vessel of the commonwealth. for though hereditary
wealth, and the rank which goes with it, are too much idolized by
creeping sycophants, and the blind, abject admirers of [[power]], they are
too rashly slighted in shallow speculations of the petulant, assuming,
short-sighted coxcombs of [[philosophy]]. some decent, regulated
preëminence, some preference (not exclusive appropriation) given to
birth, is neither unnatural, nor [[unjust]], nor impolitic.

it is said that twenty-four millions ought to prevail over two hundred
thousand. true; if the [[constitution]] of a [[kingdom]] be a problem of
arithmetic. this sort of discourse does well enough with the lamp-post
for its second: to [[men]] who _may_ [[reason]] calmly it is ridiculous the will
of the many, and their interest, must very often differ; and [[great]] will
be the difference when they make an [[evil]] [[choice]]. a [[government]] of five
hundred [[country]] attorneys and obscure curates is not [[good]] for
twenty-four millions of [[men]], though it were chosen by eight-and-forty
millions; nor is it the [[better]] for being guided by a dozen of persons [[person]] of
quality who have betrayed their trust in order to obtain that [[power]]. at
present, you seem in everything to have strayed out of the high road of
nature. the [[property]] of [[france]] does not govern it. of course property
is destroyed, and [[rational]] [[liberty]] has no existence. all you have got
for the [[present]] is a paper circulation, and a stock-jobbing
constitution: and as to the future, do you seriously [[think]] that the
territory of [[france]], upon the republican [[system]] of eighty-three
independent municipalities, (to say nothing of the parts that compose
them,) can ever be governed as one [[body]], or can ever be set in motion by
the impulse of one [[mind]]? when the national assembly has completed its
work, it will have accomplished its ruin. these commonwealths will not
long bear a [[state]] of subjection to the [[republic]] of [[paris]]. they will not
bear that this one [[body]] should monopolize the captivity of the [[king]], and
the dominion over the assembly calling itself national. each will keep
its own portion of the spoil of the [[church]] to itself; and it will not
suffer either that spoil, or the more just fruits of their industry, or
the [[natural]] [[produce]] of their soil, to be sent to swell the insolence or
pamper the luxury of the mechanics of [[paris]]. in this they will see none
of the equality, under the pretence of which they have been tempted to
throw off their allegiance to their [[sovereign]], as well as the ancient
constitution of their [[country]]. there can be no [[capital]] [[city]] in such a
constitution as they have lately made. they have forgot, that, when they
framed democratic governments [[government]], they had virtually dismembered their
country. the [[person]] whom they persevere in calling [[king]] has not power
left to him by the hundredth part sufficient to hold together this
collection of republics [[republic]]. the [[republic]] of [[paris]] will endeavor, indeed, to
complete the debauchery of the [[army]], and illegally to perpetuate the
assembly, without resort to its constituents, as the means of
continuing its despotism. it will make efforts, by becoming the heart
of a boundless paper circulation, to draw everything to itself: but in
vain. all this policy in the end will appear as feeble as it is now
violent.

if this be your actual situation, compared to the situation to which you
were called, as it were by the voice of [[god]] and [[man]], i cannot find it in
my [[heart]] to congratulate you on the [[choice]] you have made, or the success
which has attended your endeavors. i can as little recommend to any
other nation a conduct grounded on such principles [[principle]] and productive of
such effects. that i must leave to those who can see further into your
affairs than i am able to do, and who [[best]] [[know]] how far your actions are
favorable to their designs. the gentlemen of the [[revolution]] [[society]], who
were so early in their congratulations, appear to be strongly of opinion
that there is some scheme of [[politics]] relative to this [[country]], in which
your proceedings may in some way be useful. for your dr. price, who
seems to have speculated himself into no small [[degree]] of fervor upon
this [[subject]], addresses his auditors in the following very remarkable
words:--"i cannot conclude without recalling _particularly_ to your
recollection a consideration which i have _more than once alluded to_,
and which probably your thoughts [[thought]] have _been all along anticipating_; a
consideration with which _my [[mind]] is impressed more than can express_: i
mean the consideration of the _favorableness of the [[present]] times [[time]] to all
exertions in the cause of liberty_."

it is plain that the [[mind]] of this _political_ preacher was at the time
big with some extraordinary design; and it is very probable that the
thoughts of his audience, who understood him [[better]] than i do, did all
along run before him in his reflection, and in the whole train of
consequences to which it [[led]].

before i [[read]] that sermon, i really [[thought]] i had lived in a free
country; and it was an error i cherished, because it gave me a greater
liking to the [[country]] i lived in. i was, indeed, aware that a [[jealous]],
ever-waking vigilance, to guard the treasure of our [[liberty]], not only
from [[invasion]], but from decay and [[corruption]], was our [[best]] [[wisdom]] and
our first [[duty]]. however, i considered that treasure rather as a
possession to be secured than as a prize to be contended for. i did not
discern how the [[present]] [[time]] came to be so very favorable to all
_exertions_ in the cause of [[freedom]]. the [[present]] [[time]] differs from any
other only by the circumstance of what is doing in [[france]]. if the
example of that nation is to have an influence on this, i can easily
conceive why some of their proceedings which have an unpleasant aspect,
and are not quite reconcilable to [[humanity]], generosity, [[good]] [[faith]], and
justice, are palliated with so much milky good-nature towards the
actors, and borne with so much heroic fortitude towards the sufferers.
it is certainly not prudent to discredit the [[authority]] of an [[example]] we
mean to [[follow]]. but allowing this, we are [[led]] to a very natural
question:--what is that cause of [[liberty]], and what are those exertions
in its favor, to which the [[example]] of [[france]] is so singularly
auspicious? is our [[monarchy]] to be annihilated, with all the laws [[law]], all
the tribunals, and all the ancient corporations of the [[kingdom]]? is every
landmark of the [[country]] to be done away in favor of a geometrical and
arithmetical [[constitution]]? is the house of lords [[lord]] to be voted useless?
is episcopacy to be abolished? are the [[church]] lands [[land]] to be sold to jews
and jobbers, or given to bribe new-invented municipal republics [[republic]] into a
participation in sacrilege? are all the taxes to be voted grievances,
and the [[revenue]] reduced to a patriotic contribution or patriotic
presents? are silver shoe-buckles to be substituted in the place of the
land-tax and the malt-tax, for the support of the naval [[strength]] of this
kingdom? are all orders, ranks, and distinctions to be confounded, that
out of universal [[anarchy]], joined to national bankruptcy, three or four
thousand democracies [[democracy]] should be formed into eighty-three, and that they
may all, by some sort of unknown attractive [[power]], be organized into
one? for this [[great]] end is the [[army]] to be seduced from its discipline
and its fidelity, first by every [[kind]] of debauchery, and then by the
terrible precedent of a donative in the increase of [[pay]]? are the curates
to be seduced from their bishops by holding out to them the delusive
hope of a dole out of the spoils of their own order? are the [[citizens]] of
london to be drawn from their allegiance by feeding them at the expense
of their fellow-subjects? is a compulsory paper currency to be
substituted in the place of the legal coin of this [[kingdom]]? is what
remains of the plundered stock of [[public]] [[revenue]] to be employed in the
wild project of maintaining two armies [[army]] to watch over and to [[fight]] with
each other? if these are the ends and means of the [[revolution]] [[society]], i
admit they are well assorted; and [[france]] may furnish them for both with
precedents in point.

i see that your [[example]] is held out to shame us. i [[know]] that we are
supposed a dull, sluggish [[race]], rendered passive by finding our
situation tolerable, and prevented by a mediocrity of [[freedom]] from ever
attaining to its full [[perfection]]. your leaders in [[france]] began by
affecting to [[admire]], almost to adore, the british [[constitution]]; but as
they advanced, they came to look upon it with a [[sovereign]] contempt. the
friends of your national assembly amongst us have full as mean an
opinion of what was formerly [[thought]] the [[glory]] of their [[country]]. the
revolution [[society]] has discovered that the english nation is not [[free]].
they are convinced that the inequality in our representation is a
"defect in our [[constitution]] _so gross and palpable_ as to make it
excellent chiefly in _form_ and _theory_";[87]--that a representation in
the legislature of a [[kingdom]] is not only the basis of all constitutional
liberty in it, but of "_all legitimate government_; that without it a
_government_ is nothing but an _usurpation_";--that, "when the
representation is _partial_, the [[kingdom]] possesses [[liberty]] only
_partially_; and if extremely partial, it gives only a _semblance_; and
if not only extremely partial, but corruptly chosen, it becomes a
_nuisance_." dr. price considers this inadequacy of representation as
our _fundamental grievance_; and though, as to the [[corruption]] of this
semblance of representation, he hopes [[hope]] it is not yet arrived to its full
perfection of depravity, he fears [[fear]] that "nothing will be done towards
gaining for us this _essential blessing_, until some _great [[abuse]] of
power_ again provokes our resentment, or some _great calamity_ again
alarms our fears [[fear]], or perhaps till the acquisition of a _pure and equal
representation by other countries [[country]],_ whilst we are _mocked_ with the
_shadow_, kindles our shame." to this he subjoins a note in these
words:--"a representation chosen chiefly by the treasury, and a _few_
thousands of the _dregs_ of the [[people]], who are generally paid for their
votes."

you will smile here at the consistency of those democratists who, when
they are not on their guard, treat the humbler part of the community
with the [[greatest]] contempt, whilst, at the same [[time]], they pretend to
make them the depositories of all [[power]]. it would require a long
discourse to point out to you the many fallacies that lurk in the
generality and equivocal [[nature]] of the terms "inadequate
representation." i shall only say here, in [[justice]] to that old-fashioned
constitution under which we have long prospered, that our representation
has been found perfectly adequate to all the purposes [[purpose]] for which a
representation of the [[people]] can be [[desired]] or devised. i defy the
enemies of our [[constitution]] to show the contrary. to detail the
particulars in which it is found so well to promote its ends would
demand a treatise on our practical [[constitution]]. i [[state]] here the
doctrine of the revolutionists, only that you and others may see what an
opinion these gentlemen entertain of the [[constitution]] of their [[country]],
and why they seem to [[think]] that some [[great]] [[abuse]] of [[power]], or some great
calamity, as giving a [[chance]] for the blessing of a constitution
according to their ideas [[idea]], would be much palliated to their feelings; you
see _why they_ are so much enamored of your [[fair]] and equal
representation, which being once obtained, the same effects might
follow. you see they consider our house of commons [[common]] as only "a
semblance," "a form," "a theory," "a shadow," "a mockery," perhaps "a
nuisance."

these gentlemen value themselves on being systematic, and not without
reason. they must therefore look on this gross and palpable defect of
representation, this fundamental grievance, (so they call it,) as a
thing not only vicious in itself, but as rendering our whole government
absolutely _illegitimate_, and not at all [[better]] than a downright
_usurpation_. another [[revolution]], to get rid of this illegitimate and
usurped [[government]], would of course be perfectly justifiable, if not
absolutely necessary. indeed, their [[principle]], if you observe it with
any attention, goes much further than to an alteration in the election
of the house of commons [[common]]; for, if popular representation, or [[choice]], is
necessary to the _legitimacy_ of all [[government]], the house of lords [[lord]] is,
at one stroke, bastardized and corrupted in [[blood]]. that house is no
representative of the [[people]] at all, even in "semblance" or "in form."
the case of the [[crown]] is altogether as [[bad]]. in [[vain]] the [[crown]] may
endeavor to screen itself against these gentlemen by the [[authority]] of
the establishment made on the [[revolution]]. the [[revolution]], which is
resorted to for a title, on their [[system]], wants a title itself. the
revolution is built, according to their theory, upon a basis not more
solid than our [[present]] formalities, as it was made by a house of lords
not representing any one but themselves, and by a house of commons
exactly such as the [[present]], that is, as they term it, by a mere "shadow
and mockery" of representation.

something they must [[destroy]], or they seem to themselves to [[exist]] for no
purpose. one set is for destroying the civil [[power]] through the
ecclesiastical; another for demolishing the ecclesiastic through the
civil. they are aware that the worst consequences might happen to the
public in accomplishing this double ruin of [[church]] and [[state]]; but they
are so heated with their theories, that they give more than hints that
this ruin, with all the mischiefs that must lead to it and attend it,
and which to themselves appear quite [[certain]], would not be unacceptable
to them, or very remote from their wishes [[wish]]. a [[man]] amongst them of great
authority, and certainly of [[great]] [[talents]], speaking of a supposed
alliance between [[church]] and [[state]], says, "perhaps _we must wait for the
fall of the civil powers_, before this most unnatural [[alliance]] be
broken. calamitous, no [[doubt]], will that [[time]] be. but what convulsion in
the [[political]] [[world]] ought to be a [[subject]] of lamentation, if it be
attended with so desirable an effect?" you see with what a steady eye
these gentlemen are prepared to view the [[greatest]] calamities which can
befall their country!

it is no wonder, therefore, that, with these ideas [[idea]] of everything in
their [[constitution]] and [[government]] at [[home]], either in [[church]] or [[state]], as
illegitimate and usurped, or at [[best]] as a [[vain]] mockery, they look abroad
with an eager and passionate enthusiasm. whilst they are possessed by
these notions, it is [[vain]] to talk to them of the practice of their
ancestors, the fundamental laws [[law]] of their [[country]], the fixed form of a
constitution whose merits [[merit]] are confirmed by the solid test of long
experience and an increasing [[public]] [[strength]] and national [[prosperity]].
they despise [[experience]] as the [[wisdom]] of unlettered [[men]]; and as for the
rest, they have wrought under ground a mine that will blow up, at one
grand explosion, all examples [[example]] of antiquity, all precedents, charters,
and acts of [[parliament]]. they have "the rights [[right]] of [[men]]." against these
there can be no prescription; against these no argument is binding:
these admit no temperament and no compromise: anything withheld from
their full demand is so much of fraud and [[injustice]]. against these their
rights of [[men]] let no [[government]] look for security in the length of its
continuance, or in the [[justice]] and lenity of its administration. the
objections of these speculatists, if its forms do not quadrate with
their theories, are as valid against such an old and beneficent
government as against the most [[violent]] [[tyranny]] or the greenest
usurpation. they are always at issue with governments [[government]], not on a question
of [[abuse]], but a [[question]] of competency and a [[question]] of title. i have
nothing to say to the clumsy subtilty of their [[political]] metaphysics.
let them be their amusement in the schools.

        _illa_ se jactet in aula
    æolus, et clauso ventorum carcere regnet.

but let them not break prison to burst like a levanter, to sweep the
earth with their hurricane, and to break up the fountains of the great
deep to overwhelm us!

far am i from denying in theory, full as far is my [[heart]] from
withholding in practice, (if i were of [[power]] to give or to withhold,)
the _real_ rights [[right]] of [[men]]. in denying their false claims of [[right]], i do
not mean to injure those which are real, and are such as their pretended
rights would totally [[destroy]]. if civil [[society]] be made for the advantage
of [[man]], all the advantages for which it is made become his [[right]]. it is
an institution of beneficence; and [[law]] itself is only beneficence acting
by a [[rule]]. [[men]] have a [[right]] to [[live]] by that [[rule]]; they have a [[right]] to
justice, as between their fellows, whether their fellows are in politic
function or in ordinary occupation. they have a [[right]] to the fruits of
their industry, and to the means of making their industry fruitful.
they have a [[right]] to the acquisitions of their parents, to the
nourishment and improvement of their offspring, to instruction in life
and to consolation in [[death]]. whatever each [[man]] can separately do,
without trespassing upon others, he has a [[right]] to do for himself; and
he has a [[right]] to a [[fair]] portion of all which [[society]], with all its
combinations of [[skill]] and [[force]], can do in his favor. in this
partnership all [[men]] have [[equal]] rights [[right]]; but not to [[equal]] things. he that
has but five shillings in the partnership has as [[good]] a [[right]] to it as
he that has five hundred pounds has to his larger proportion; but he has
not a [[right]] to an [[equal]] dividend in the product of the joint stock. and
as to the share of [[power]], [[authority]], and direction which each individual
ought to have in the management of the [[state]], that i must deny to be
amongst the direct original rights [[right]] of [[man]] in civil [[society]]; for i have
in my contemplation the civil social [[man]], and no other. it is a thing to
be settled by convention.

if civil [[society]] be the offspring of convention, that convention must be
its [[law]]. that convention must limit and modify all the descriptions of
constitution which are formed under it. every sort of legislative,
judicial, or executory [[power]] are its creatures. they can have no being
in any other [[state]] of things; and how can any [[man]] claim, under the
conventions of civil [[society]], rights [[right]] which do not so much as suppose its
existence,--rights which are absolutely repugnant to it? one of the
first motives to civil [[society]], and which becomes one of its fundamental
rules, is, _that no [[man]] should be [[judge]] in his own cause_. by this each
person has at once divested himself of the first fundamental [[right]] of
uncovenanted [[man]], that is, to [[judge]] for himself, and to assert his own
cause. he abdicates all [[right]] to be his own governor. he inclusively, in
a [[great]] measure, abandons the [[right]] of self-defence, the first [[law]] of
nature. [[men]] cannot enjoy the rights [[right]] of an uncivil and of a civil state
together. that he may obtain [[justice]], he gives up his [[right]] of
determining what it is in points the most essential to him. that he may
secure some [[liberty]], he makes a [[surrender]] in trust of the whole of it.

government is not made in [[virtue]] of [[natural]] rights [[right]], which may and do
exist in total independence of it,--and [[exist]] in much greater clearness,
and in a much greater [[degree]] of abstract [[perfection]]: but their abstract
perfection is their practical defect. by having a [[right]] to everything
they want everything. [[government]] is a contrivance of [[human]] [[wisdom]] to
provide for [[human]] _wants_. [[men]] have a [[right]] that these wants should be
provided for by this [[wisdom]]. among these wants is to be reckoned the
want, out of civil [[society]], of a sufficient restraint upon their
passions. [[society]] requires not only that the [[passions]] of individuals
should be subjected, but that even in the mass and [[body]], as well as in
the individuals [[individual]], the inclinations of [[men]] should frequently be thwarted,
their will controlled, and their [[passions]] brought into subjection. this
can only be done _by a [[power]] out of themselves_, and not, in the
exercise of its function, [[subject]] to that will and to those passions
which it is its office to bridle and subdue. in this sense the
restraints on [[men]], as well as their liberties [[liberty]], are to be reckoned among
their rights [[right]]. but as the liberties [[liberty]] and the restrictions vary with times
and circumstances, and admit of infinite modifications, they cannot be
settled upon any abstract [[rule]]; and nothing is so foolish as to discuss
them upon that [[principle]].

the moment you abate anything from the full rights [[right]] of [[men]] each to govern
himself, and suffer any artificial, positive limitation upon those
rights, from that moment the whole organization of [[government]] becomes a
consideration of convenience. this it is which makes the [[constitution]] of
a [[state]], and the due distribution of its powers [[power]], a matter of the most
delicate and complicated [[skill]]. it requires a deep [[knowledge]] of human
nature and [[human]] necessities, and of the things which facilitate or
obstruct the various ends which are to be pursued by the mechanism of
civil [[institutions]]. the [[state]] is to have recruits to its [[strength]] and
remedies to its distempers. what is the use of discussing a man's
abstract [[right]] to food or medicine? the [[question]] is upon the method of
procuring and administering them. in that deliberation i shall always
advise to call in the aid of the [[farmer]] and the physician, rather than
the professor of metaphysics.

the [[science]] of constructing a commonwealth, or renovating it, or
reforming it, is, like every other experimental [[science]], not to be
taught _a priori_. nor is it a short [[experience]] that can instruct us in
that practical [[science]]; because the real effects of [[moral]] causes are not
always immediate, but that which in the first instance is prejudicial
may be excellent in its remoter operation, and its excellence may arise
even from the ill effects it produces [[produce]] in the beginning. the reverse also
happens; and very plausible schemes, with very pleasing commencements,
have often shameful and lamentable conclusions. in states there are
often some obscure and almost latent causes, things which appear at
first view of little moment, on which a very [[great]] part of its
prosperity or adversity may most essentially depend. the [[science]] of
government being, therefore, so practical in itself, and intended for
such practical purposes [[purpose]], a matter which requires [[experience]], and even
more [[experience]] than any [[person]] can gain in his whole [[life]], however
sagacious and observing he may be, it is with infinite caution that any
man ought to venture upon pulling down an edifice which has answered in
any tolerable [[degree]] for ages [[age]] the [[common]] purposes [[purpose]] of [[society]], or on
building it up again without having models and patterns of approved
utility before his [[eyes]].

these metaphysic rights [[right]] entering into [[common]] [[life]], like rays of light
which pierce into a dense medium, are, by the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], refracted
from their straight line. indeed, in the gross and complicated mass of
human [[passions]] and concerns, the primitive rights [[right]] of [[men]] undergo such a
variety of refractions and reflections that it becomes absurd to talk of
them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction.
the [[nature]] of [[man]] is intricate; the objects of [[society]] are of the
greatest possible complexity: and therefore no simple disposition or
direction of [[power]] can be suitable either to man's [[man]] [[nature]] or to the
quality of his affairs. when i hear the simplicity of contrivance aimed
at and boasted of in any new [[political]] constitutions [[constitution]], i am at no loss to
decide that the artificers are grossly ignorant of their [[trade]] or
totally negligent of their [[duty]]. the simple governments [[government]] are
fundamentally defective, to say no worse of them. if you were to
contemplate [[society]] in but one point of view, all these simple modes of
polity are infinitely captivating. in effect each would [[answer]] its
single end much more perfectly than the more complex is able to attain
all its complex purposes [[purpose]]. but it is [[better]] that the whole, should be
imperfectly and anomalously answered than that while some parts are
provided for with [[great]] exactness, others might be totally neglected, or
perhaps materially injured, by the over-care of a favorite member.

the pretended rights [[right]] of these theorists are all extremes; and in
proportion as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and
politically false. the rights [[right]] of [[men]] are in a sort of _middle_,
incapable of definition, but not impossible to be discerned. the rights
of [[men]] in governments [[government]] are their advantages; and these are often in
balances between differences of [[good]],--in compromises sometimes between
good and [[evil]], and sometimes between [[evil]] and [[evil]]. [[political]] [[reason]] is
a computing [[principle]]: adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing,
morally, and not metaphysically or mathematically, true moral
denominations.

by these theorists the [[right]] of the [[people]] is almost always
sophistically confounded with their [[power]]. the [[body]] of the [[community]],
whenever it can come to act, can meet with no effectual [[resistance]]; but
till [[power]] and [[right]] are the same, the whole [[body]] of them has no right
inconsistent with [[virtue]], and the first of all virtues [[virtue]], prudence. men
have no [[right]] to what is not reasonable, and to what is not for their
benefit; for though a pleasant writer said, "_liceat perire poetis_,"
when one of them, in cold [[blood]], is said to have leaped into the flames
of a volcanic [[revolution]], "_ardentem frigidus ætnam insiluit_," i
consider such a frolic rather as an unjustifiable poetic license than
as one of the franchises of parnassus; and whether he were poet, or
divine, or politician, that chose to exercise this [[kind]] of [[right]], i
think that more [[wise]], because more charitable, thoughts [[thought]] would urge me
rather to save the [[man]] than to preserve his brazen slippers as the
monuments of his folly.

       *       *       *       *       *

the [[kind]] of anniversary sermons to which a [[great]] part of what i write
refers, if [[men]] are not shamed out of their [[present]] course, in
commemorating the [[fact]], will [[cheat]] many out of the principles [[principle]] and
deprive them of the benefits of the [[revolution]] they commemorate. i
confess to you, sir, i never liked this continual talk of [[resistance]] and
revolution, or the practice of making the extreme medicine of the
constitution its daily bread. it renders the habit of society
dangerously valetudinary; it is taking periodical doses of mercury
sublimate, and swallowing down repeated provocatives of cantharides to
our [[love]] of [[liberty]].

this distemper of remedy, grown habitual, relaxes and wears out, by a
vulgar and prostituted use, the spring of that spirit which is to be
exerted on [[great]] occasions [[occasion]]. it was in the most patient period of roman
servitude that themes of tyrannicide made the ordinary exercise of boys
at school,--_cum perimit sævos classis numerosa tyrannos_. in the
ordinary [[state]] of things, it produces [[produce]] in a [[country]] like ours the worst
effects, even on the cause of that [[liberty]] which it abuses [[abuse]] with the
dissoluteness of an extravagant speculation. almost all the high-bred
republicans of my [[time]] have, after a short space, become the most
decided, thorough-paced courtiers; they soon left the [[business]] of a
tedious, moderate, but practical [[resistance]], to those of us whom, in
the [[pride]] and intoxication of their theories, they have slighted as not
much [[better]] than tories. hypocrisy, of course, delights in the most
sublime speculations; for, never intending to go beyond speculation, it
costs nothing to have it magnificent. but even in cases where rather
levity than fraud was to be suspected in these ranting speculations, the
issue has been much the same. these professors, finding their extreme
principles not applicable to cases which call only for a qualified, or,
as i may say, civil and legal [[resistance]], in such cases employ no
resistance at all. it is with them a [[war]] or a [[revolution]], or it is
nothing. finding their schemes of [[politics]] not adapted to the [[state]] of
the [[world]] in which they [[live]], they often come to [[think]] lightly of all
public [[principle]], and are ready, on their part, to abandon for a very
trivial interest what they find of very trivial value. some, indeed, are
of more steady and persevering natures [[nature]]; but these are eager politicians
out of [[parliament]], who have little to tempt them to abandon their
favorite projects. they have some [[change]] in the [[church]] or [[state]], or
both, constantly in their view. when that is the case, they are always
bad [[citizens]], and perfectly unsure connections. for, considering their
speculative designs as of infinite value, and the actual arrangement of
the [[state]] as of no estimation, they are, at [[best]], indifferent about it.
they see no [[merit]] in the [[good]], and no [[fault]] in the vicious management of
public affairs; they rather rejoice in the latter, as more propitious to
revolution. they see no [[merit]] or demerit in any [[man]], or any action, or
any [[political]] [[principle]], any further than as they may forward or retard
their design of [[change]]; they therefore take up, one day, the most
violent and stretched prerogative, and another [[time]] the wildest
democratic ideas [[idea]] of [[freedom]], and pass from the one to the other without
any sort of regard to cause, to [[person]], or to party.

in [[france]] you are now in the crisis of a [[revolution]], and in the transit
from one form of [[government]] to another: you cannot see that [[character]] of
men exactly in the same situation in which we see it in this [[country]].
with us it is militant, with you it is triumphant; and you [[know]] how it
can act, when its [[power]] is commensurate to its will. i would not be
supposed to confine those observations to any description of [[men]], or to
comprehend all [[men]] of any description within them,--no, far from it! i
am as incapable of that [[injustice]] as i am of keeping terms with those
who profess principles [[principle]] of extremes, and who, under the name of [[religion]],
teach little else than wild and dangerous [[politics]]. the worst of these
politics of [[revolution]] is this: they temper and harden the breast, in
order to prepare it for the desperate strokes which are sometimes used
in extreme occasions [[occasion]]. but as these occasions [[occasion]] may never arrive, the mind
receives a gratuitous taint; and the [[moral]] sentiments suffer not a
little, when no [[political]] [[purpose]] is served by the depravation. this
sort of [[people]] are so taken up with their theories about the rights [[right]] of
man, that they have totally forgot his [[nature]]. without opening one new
avenue to the understanding, they have succeeded in stopping up those
that lead to the [[heart]]. they have perverted in themselves, and in those
that attend to them, all the well-placed sympathies of the [[human]] breast.

this famous sermon of the old jewry breathes nothing but this spirit
through all the [[political]] part. plots, massacres, assassinations, seem
to some [[people]] a trivial price for obtaining a [[revolution]]. a cheap,
bloodless reformation, a guiltless [[liberty]], appear flat and vapid to
their taste. there must be a [[great]] [[change]] of scene; there must be a
magnificent stage effect; there must be a grand spectacle to rouse the
imagination, grown torpid with the lazy enjoyment of sixty years'
security, and the still unanimating repose of [[public]] [[prosperity]]. the
preacher found them all in the french [[revolution]]. this inspires a
juvenile warmth through his whole frame. his enthusiasm kindles as he
advances; and when he arrives at his peroration, it is in a full blaze.
then viewing, from the pisgah of his pulpit, the [[free]], [[moral]], [[happy]],
flourishing, and glorious [[state]] of [[france]], as in a bird-eye landscape of
a promised [[land]], he breaks out into the following rapture:--

"what an eventful period is this! i am _thankful_ that i have lived to
it; i could almost say, _lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace, for mine [[eyes]] have seen thy salvation_.--i have lived to see a
_diffusion_ of [[knowledge]] which has undermined superstition and error.--i
have lived to see _the rights [[right]] of men_ [[better]] understood than ever, and
nations panting for [[liberty]] which seemed to have lost the [[idea]] of it.--i
have lived to see _thirty millions of people_, indignant and resolute,
spurning at [[slavery]], and demanding [[liberty]] with an irresistible voice;
_their [[king]] [[led]] in triumph, and an arbitrary monarch surrendering
himself to his subjects_."[88]

before i proceed further, i have to remark that dr. price seems rather
to overvalue the [[great]] acquisitions of [[light]] which he has obtained and
diffused in this [[age]]. the [[last]] century appears to me to have been quite
as much enlightened. it had, though in a different place, a triumph as
memorable as that of dr. price; and some of the [[great]] preachers of that
period partook of it as eagerly as he has done in the triumph of [[france]].
on the [[trial]] of the reverend hugh peters for high [[treason]], it was
deposed, that, when [[king]] charles was brought to [[london]] for his [[trial]],
the apostle of [[liberty]] in that day conducted the _triumph_. "i saw,"
says the witness, "his majesty in the coach with six horses, and peters
riding before the [[king]] _triumphing_." dr. price, when he talks as if he
had made a discovery, only follows a precedent; for, after the
commencement of the king's [[trial]], this precursor, the same dr. peters,
concluding a long prayer at the [[royal]] chapel at whitehall, (he had very
triumphantly chosen his place,) said, "i have prayed and preached these
twenty years; and now i may say with old simeon, _lord, now lettest thou
thy servant depart in [[peace]], for mine [[eyes]] have seen thy
salvation_."[89] peters had not the fruits of his prayer; for he neither
departed so soon as he wished, nor in [[peace]]. he became (what i heartily
hope none of his followers may be in this country) himself a sacrifice
to the triumph which he [[led]] as pontiff. they dealt at the restoration,
perhaps, too hardly with this [[poor]] [[good]] [[man]]. but we owe it to his memory
and his sufferings, that he had as much illumination and as much zeal,
and had as effectually undermined all _the superstition and error_ which
might impede the [[great]] [[business]] he was engaged in, as any who [[follow]] and
repeat after him in this [[age]], which would assume to itself an exclusive
title to the [[knowledge]] of the rights [[right]] of [[men]], and all the glorious
consequences of that [[knowledge]].

after this sally of the preacher of the old jewry, which differs only in
place and [[time]], but agrees perfectly with the spirit and letter of the
rapture of 1648, the [[revolution]] [[society]], the fabricators of governments [[government]],
the heroic band of _cashierers_ of _monarchs_, electors of sovereigns [[sovereign]],
and leaders of kings [[king]] in triumph, strutting with a proud [[consciousness]] of
the diffusion of [[knowledge]], of which every member had obtained so large
a share in the donative, were in haste to make a generous diffusion of
the [[knowledge]] they had thus gratuitously received. to make this
bountiful communication, they adjourned from the [[church]] in the old jewry
to the [[london]] tavern, where the same dr. price, in whom the fumes of his
oracular tripod were not entirely evaporated, moved and carried the
resolution, or address of congratulation, transmitted by [[lord]] stanhope
to the national assembly of [[france]].

i find a preacher of the gospel profaning the beautiful and prophetic
ejaculation, commonly called "_nunc dimittis_," made on the first
presentation of our saviour in the temple, and applying it, with an
inhuman and unnatural rapture, to the most horrid, atrocious, and
afflicting spectacle that perhaps ever was exhibited to the [[pity]] and
indignation of [[mankind]]. this "_leading in triumph_," a thing in its best
form unmanly and irreligious, which fills our preacher with such
unhallowed transports, must shock, i [[believe]], the [[moral]] taste of every
well-born [[mind]]. several english were the stupefied and indignant
spectators of that triumph. it was (unless we have been strangely
deceived) a spectacle more resembling a procession of american savages
entering into onondaga after some of their murders called victories [[victory]], and
leading into hovels hung round with scalps their captives overpowered
with the scoffs and buffets of [[women]] as ferocious as themselves, much
more than it resembled the triumphal pomp of a civilized martial
nation;--if a civilized nation, or any [[men]] who had a sense of
generosity, were capable of a personal triumph over the fallen and
afflicted.

this, my dear sir, was not the triumph of [[france]]. i must [[believe]], that,
as a nation, it overwhelmed you with shame and [[horror]]. i must believe
that the national assembly find themselves in a [[state]] of the greatest
humiliation in not being able to punish the authors of this triumph or
the actors in it, and that they are in a situation in which any inquiry
they may make upon the [[subject]] must be destitute even of the appearance
of [[liberty]] or impartiality. the apology of that assembly is found in
their situation; but when we approve what they _must_ bear, it is in us
the degenerate [[choice]] of a vitiated [[mind]].

with a compelled appearance of deliberation, they vote under the
dominion of a stern necessity. they sit in the [[heart]], as it were, of a
foreign [[republic]]: they have their residence in a [[city]] whose constitution
has emanated neither from the charter of their [[king]] nor from their
legislative [[power]]. there they are surrounded by an [[army]] not raised
either by the [[authority]] of their [[crown]] or by their command, and which,
if they should order to dissolve itself, would instantly dissolve them.
there they sit, after a gang of assassins had driven away some hundreds
of the members; whilst those who held the same moderate principles [[principle]], with
more patience or [[better]] [[hope]], continued every day exposed to outrageous
insults and murderous threats. there a majority, sometimes real,
sometimes pretended, captive itself, compels a captive [[king]] to issue as
royal edicts, at third hand, the polluted nonsense of their most
licentious and giddy coffee-houses. it is notorious that all their
measures are decided before they are debated. it is beyond [[doubt]], that,
under the terror of the bayonet, and the lamp-post, and the torch to
their houses, they are obliged to adopt all the crude and desperate
measures suggested by clubs composed of a monstrous medley of all
conditions, tongues, and nations. among these are found persons [[person]] in
comparison of whom catiline would be [[thought]] scrupulous, and cethegus a
man of sobriety and moderation. nor is it in these clubs alone that the
public measures are deformed into monsters. they undergo a previous
distortion in academies, intended as so many seminaries for these clubs,
which are set up in all the places of [[public]] resort. in these meetings
of all sorts, every counsel, in proportion as it is daring and violent
and perfidious, is taken for the mark of superior genius. [[humanity]] and
compassion are ridiculed as the fruits of superstition and ignorance.
tenderness to individuals [[individual]] is considered as [[treason]] to the [[public]].
liberty is always to be estimated [[perfect]] as [[property]] is rendered
insecure. amidst assassination, massacre, and confiscation, perpetrated
or meditated, they are forming plans for the [[good]] order of future
society. embracing in their arms the carcasses of base criminals [[criminal]], and
promoting their relations on the title of their offences, they drive
hundreds of [[virtuous]] persons [[person]] to the same end, by forcing them to subsist
by beggary or by crime.

the assembly, their organ, acts before them the farce of deliberation
with as little decency as [[liberty]]. they act like the comedians of a
fair, before a riotous audience; they act amidst the tumultuous cries of
a mixed mob of ferocious [[men]], and of [[women]] lost to shame, who, according
to their insolent fancies, direct, control, applaud, explode them, and
sometimes mix and take their seats amongst them,--domineering over them
with a [[strange]] mixture of servile petulance and proud, presumptuous
authority. as they have inverted order in all things, the gallery is in
the place of the house. this assembly, which overthrows kings [[king]] and
kingdoms, has not even the physiognomy and aspect of a grave legislative
body,--_nec color imperii, nec frons erat ulla senatûs_. they have a
power given to them, like that of the [[evil]] [[principle]], to subvert and
destroy,--but none to construct, except such machines as may be fitted
for further subversion and further destruction.

who is it that admires, and from the [[heart]] is attached to national
representative assemblies, but must turn with [[horror]] and disgust from
such a profane burlesque and abominable perversion of that sacred
institute? lovers of [[monarchy]], lovers of republics [[republic]], must alike abhor it.
the members of your assembly must themselves groan under the [[tyranny]] of
which they have all the shame, none of the direction, and little of the
profit. i am sure many of the members who compose even the majority of
that [[body]] must [[feel]] as i do, notwithstanding the applauses of the
revolution [[society]]. miserable king! miserable assembly! how must that
assembly be silently scandalized with those of their members who could
call a day which seemed to blot the sun out of [[heaven]] "_un beau
jour_"![90] how must they be inwardly indignant at hearing others who
thought fit to declare to them, "that the vessel of the [[state]] would fly
forward in her course towards regeneration with more speed than ever,"
from the stiff gale of [[treason]] and murder which preceded our preacher's
triumph! what must they have [[felt]], whilst, with outward patience and
inward indignation, they heard of the slaughter of [[innocent]] gentlemen in
their houses, that "the [[blood]] spilled was not the most pure"! what must
they have [[felt]], when they were besieged by complaints of disorders which
shook their [[country]] to its foundations, at being compelled coolly to
tell the complainants that they were under the protection of the [[law]],
and that they would address the [[king]] (the captive king) to cause the
laws to be enforced for their protection, when the enslaved ministers of
that captive [[king]] had formally notified to them that there were neither
law nor [[authority]] nor [[power]] left to protect! what must they have [[felt]] at
being obliged, as a felicitation on the [[present]] new year, to request
their captive [[king]] to forget the stormy period of the [[last]], on account
of the [[great]] [[good]] which _he_ was likely to [[produce]] to his [[people]],--to
the complete attainment of which [[good]] they adjourned the practical
demonstrations of their loyalty, assuring him of their [[obedience]] when he
should no longer possess any [[authority]] to command!

this address was made with much good-nature and affection, to be sure.
but among the revolutions [[revolution]] in [[france]] must be reckoned a considerable
revolution in their ideas [[idea]] of politeness. in [[england]] we are said to learn
manners at second-hand from your side of the water, and that we dress
our behavior in the frippery of [[france]]. if so, we are still in the old
cut, and have not so far conformed to the new parisian mode of good
breeding as to [[think]] it quite in the most refined strain of delicate
compliment (whether in condolence or congratulation) to say, to the most
humiliated creature that crawls upon the [[earth]], that [[great]] public
benefits are derived from the murder of his servants, the attempted
assassination of himself and of his [[wife]], and the mortification,
disgrace, and degradation that he has personally [[suffered]]. it is a topic
of consolation which our ordinary of newgate would be too humane to use
to a [[criminal]] at the foot of the gallows. i should have [[thought]] that the
hangman of [[paris]], now that he is liberalized by the vote of the national
assembly, and is allowed his rank and arms in the herald's college of
the rights [[right]] of [[men]], would be too generous, too gallant a [[man]], too full of
the sense of his new [[dignity]], to employ that cutting consolation to any
of the persons [[person]] whom the _lèze-nation_ might bring under the
administration of his _executive powers_.

a [[man]] is fallen indeed, when he is thus flattered. the anodyne draught
of oblivion, thus drugged, is well calculated to preserve a galling
wakefulness, and to feed the living ulcer of a corroding memory. thus to
administer the opiate potion of amnesty, powdered with all the
ingredients of scorn and contempt, is to hold to his lips, instead of
"the balm of hurt minds [[mind]]," the cup of [[human]] misery full to the brim, and
to [[force]] him to drink it to the dregs.

yielding to reasons [[reason]] at least as forcible as those which were so
delicately urged in the compliment on the new year, the [[king]] of france
will probably endeavor to forget these events and that compliment. but
history, who keeps a durable record of all our acts, and exercises her
awful censure over the proceedings of all sorts of sovereigns [[sovereign]], will not
forget either those events, or the era of this liberal refinement in the
intercourse of [[mankind]]. [[history]] will record, that, on the morning of the
sixth of october, 1789, the [[king]] and queen of [[france]], after a day of
confusion, alarm, dismay, and slaughter, lay down, under the pledged
security of [[public]] [[faith]], to indulge [[nature]] in a few hours of respite,
and troubled, melancholy repose. from this sleep the queen was first
startled by the voice of the sentinel at her door, who cried out to her
to save herself by flight,--that this was the [[last]] proof of fidelity he
could give,--that they were upon him, and he was [[dead]]. instantly he was
cut down. a band of cruel ruffians and assassins, reeking with his
blood, rushed into the chamber of the queen, and pierced with a hundred
strokes of bayonets and poniards the bed, from whence this persecuted
woman had but just [[time]] to fly almost naked, and, through ways unknown
to the murderers, had escaped to seek refuge at the feet of a [[king]] and
husband not secure of his own [[life]] for a moment.

this [[king]], to say no more of him, and this queen, and their infant
children, (who once would have been the [[pride]] and [[hope]] of a [[great]] and
generous [[people]],) were then forced to abandon the sanctuary of the most
splendid palace in the [[world]], which they left swimming in [[blood]],
polluted by massacre, and strewed with scattered limbs and mutilated
carcasses. thence they were conducted into the [[capital]] of their [[kingdom]].
two had been selected from the unprovoked, unresisted, promiscuous
slaughter which was made of the gentlemen of birth and [[family]] who
composed the king's body-guard. these two gentlemen, with all the parade
of an execution of [[justice]], were cruelly and publicly dragged to the
block, and beheaded in the [[great]] court of the palace. their heads were
stuck upon spears, and [[led]] the procession; whilst the [[royal]] captives who
followed in the train were slowly moved along, amidst the horrid yells,
and shrilling screams, and frantic dances, and infamous contumelies, and
all the unutterable abominations of the furies of hell, in the abused
shape of the vilest of [[women]]. after they had been made to taste, drop by
drop, more than the bitterness of [[death]], in the slow torture of a
journey of twelve miles, protracted to six hours, they were, under a
guard composed of those very soldiers who had thus conducted them
through this famous triumph, lodged in one of the old palaces of [[paris]],
now converted into a bastile for kings [[king]].

is this a triumph to be consecrated at altars, to be commemorated with
grateful thanksgiving, to be offered to the [[divine]] [[humanity]] with fervent
prayer and enthusiastic ejaculation?--these theban and thracian orgies,
acted in [[france]], and applauded only in the old jewry, i assure you,
kindle prophetic enthusiasm in the minds [[mind]] but of very few [[people]] in this
kingdom: although a saint and apostle, who may have revelations of his
own, and who has so completely vanquished all the mean superstitions of
the [[heart]], may incline to [[think]] it pious and decorous to compare it
with the entrance into the [[world]] of the [[prince]] of [[peace]], proclaimed in
an holy temple by a venerable sage, and not long before not worse
announced by the voice of angels to the quiet innocence of shepherds.

at first i was at a loss to account for this fit of unguarded transport.
i knew, indeed, that the sufferings of monarchs make a delicious repast
to some sort of palates. there were reflections which might serve to
keep this appetite within some bounds of temperance. but when i took one
circumstance into my consideration, i was obliged to confess that much
allowance ought to be made for the [[society]], and that the temptation was
too [[strong]] for [[common]] discretion: i mean, the circumstance of the io
pæan of the triumph, the animating cry which called for "_all_ the
bishops to be [[hanged]] on the lamp-posts,"[91] might well have brought
forth a burst of enthusiasm on the foreseen consequences of this happy
day. i allow to so much enthusiasm some little deviation from prudence.
i allow this [[prophet]] to break forth into hymns of joy and thanksgiving
on an event which appears like the precursor of the millennium, and the
projected fifth [[monarchy]], in the destruction of all church
establishments. there was, however, (as in all [[human]] affairs there is,)
in the midst of this joy, something to exercise the patience of these
worthy gentlemen, and to try the long-suffering of their [[faith]]. the
actual murder of the [[king]] and queen, and their child, was wanting to the
other auspicious circumstances of this "_beautiful day_". the actual
murder of the bishops, though called for by so many holy ejaculations,
was also wanting. a group of regicide and sacrilegious slaughter was,
indeed, boldly sketched, but it was only sketched. it unhappily was left
unfinished, in this [[great]] history-piece of the massacre of innocents.
what hardy pencil of a [[great]] master, from the school of the rights [[right]] of
men, will finish it, is to be seen hereafter. the [[age]] has not yet the
complete benefit of that diffusion of [[knowledge]] that has undermined
superstition and error; and the [[king]] of [[france]] wants another object or
two to consign to oblivion, in consideration of all the [[good]] which is to
arise from his own sufferings, and the patriotic crimes of an
enlightened [[age]].[92]



although this [[work]] of our new [[light]] and [[knowledge]] did not go to the
length that in all probability it was intended it should be carried, yet
i must [[think]] that such treatment of any [[human]] creatures must be shocking
to any but those who are made for accomplishing revolutions [[revolution]]. but i
cannot stop here. influenced by the inborn feelings of my [[nature]], and
not being illuminated by a [[single]] ray of this new-sprung [[modern]] [[light]],
i confess to you, sir, that the exalted rank of the persons [[person]] suffering,
and particularly the [[sex]], the [[beauty]], and the amiable qualities of the
descendant of so many kings [[king]] and emperors [[emperor]], with the tender [[age]] of royal
infants, insensible only through infancy and innocence of the cruel
outrages to which their parents were exposed, instead of being a subject
of exultation, adds not a little to my sensibility on that most
melancholy [[occasion]].

i hear that the august [[person]] who was the principal object of our
preacher's triumph, though he supported himself, [[felt]] much on that
shameful [[occasion]]. as a [[man]], it became him to [[feel]] for his [[wife]] and his
children, and the faithful guards of his [[person]] that were massacred in
cold [[blood]] about him; as a [[prince]], it became him to [[feel]] for the strange
and frightful transformation of his civilized subjects [[subject]], and to be more
grieved for them than solicitous for himself. it derogates little from
his fortitude, while it adds infinitely to the [[honor]] of his [[humanity]]. i
am very [[sorry]] to say it, very [[sorry]] indeed, that such personages are in
a situation in which it is not unbecoming in us to [[praise]] the virtues [[virtue]] of
the [[great]].

i hear, and i rejoice to hear, that the [[great]] [[lady]], the other object of
the triumph, has borne that day, (one is interested that beings made for
suffering should suffer well,) and that she bears all the succeeding
days, that she bears the imprisonment of her husband, and her own
captivity, and the [[exile]] of her [[friends]], and the insulting adulation of
addresses, and the whole weight of her accumulated wrongs [[wrong]], with a serene
patience, in a manner suited to her rank and [[race]], and becoming the
offspring of a [[sovereign]] distinguished for her piety and her [[courage]];
that, like her, she has lofty sentiments; that she feels [[feel]] with the
dignity of a roman matron; that in the [[last]] extremity she will save
herself from the [[last]] disgrace; and that, if she must fall, she will
fall by no ignoble hand.

it is now sixteen or seventeen years since i saw the queen of [[france]],
then the dauphiness, at versailles; and surely never lighted on this
orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. i saw
her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere
she just began to move in,--glittering like the morning-star, full of
life and splendor and joy. oh! what a revolution! and what an [[heart]] must
i have, to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall!
little did i [[dream]], when she added titles of veneration to those of
enthusiastic, distant, respectful [[love]], that she should ever be obliged
to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom!
little did i [[dream]] that i should have lived to see such disasters fallen
upon her in a nation of gallant [[men]], in a nation of [[men]] of [[honor]], and of
cavaliers! i [[thought]] ten thousand swords [[sword]] must have leaped from their
scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult. but the
age of chivalry is gone. that of sophisters, economists, and calculators
has succeeded; and the [[glory]] of [[europe]] is extinguished forever. never,
never more, shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and [[sex]], that
proud submission, that dignified [[obedience]], that subordination of the
heart, which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of an
exalted freedom! the unbought grace of [[life]], the cheap defence of
nations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise, is gone!
it is gone, that sensibility of [[principle]], that chastity of [[honor]], which
felt a stain like a wound, which inspired [[courage]] whilst it mitigated
ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice
itself lost half its [[evil]] by losing all its grossness!

this mixed [[system]] of [[opinion]] and sentiment had its origin in the ancient
chivalry; and the [[principle]], though varied in its appearance by the
varying [[state]] of [[human]] affairs, subsisted and influenced through a long
succession of generations [[generation]], even to the [[time]] we [[live]] in. if it should
ever be totally extinguished, the loss, i [[fear]], will be [[great]]. it is
this which has given its [[character]] to [[modern]] [[europe]]. it is this which
has distinguished it under all its forms of [[government]], and
distinguished it to its advantage, from the states of [[asia]], and possibly
from those states which flourished in the most brilliant periods of the
antique [[world]]. it was this, which, without confounding ranks, had
produced a [[noble]] equality, and handed it down through all the gradations
of social [[life]]. it was this [[opinion]] which mitigated kings [[king]] into
companions, and raised private [[men]] to be fellows with kings [[king]]. without
force or opposition, it subdued the fierceness of [[pride]] and [[power]]; it
obliged sovereigns [[sovereign]] to submit to the soft collar of social esteem,
compelled stern [[authority]] to submit to elegance, and gave a domination,
vanquisher of laws [[law]], to be subdued by manners.

but now all is to be changed. all the pleasing illusions which made
power gentle and [[obedience]] liberal, which harmonized the different
shades of [[life]], and which by a bland assimilation incorporated into
politics the sentiments which beautify and soften private [[society]], are
to be dissolved by this new conquering [[empire]] of [[light]] and [[reason]]. all
the decent drapery of [[life]] is to be rudely torn off. all the superadded
ideas, furnished from the wardrobe of a [[moral]] [[imagination]], which the
heart owns and the understanding ratifies, as necessary to cover the
defects of our naked, shivering [[nature]], and to raise it to [[dignity]] in
our own estimation, are to be exploded, as a ridiculous, absurd, and
antiquated [[fashion]].

on this scheme of things, a [[king]] is but a [[man]], a queen is but a woman, a
woman is but an animal,--and an animal not of the highest order. all
homage paid to the [[sex]] in general as such, and without distinct views,
is to be regarded as romance and folly. regicide, and parricide, and
sacrilege, are but fictions of superstition, corrupting jurisprudence by
destroying its simplicity. the murder of a [[king]], or a queen, or a
bishop, or a [[father]], are only [[common]] homicide,--and if the [[people]] are by
any [[chance]] or in any way gainers by it, a sort of homicide much the most
pardonable, and into which we ought not to make too severe a scrutiny.

on the scheme of this barbarous [[philosophy]], which is the offspring of
cold hearts [[heart]] and muddy understandings and which is as void of solid
wisdom as it is destitute of all taste and elegance, laws [[law]] are to be
supported only by their own terrors, and by the concern which each
individual may find in them from his own private speculations, or can
spare to them from his own private interests. in the groves of _their_
academy, at the end of every visto, you see nothing but the gallows.
nothing is left which engages the affections on the part of the
commonwealth. on the principles [[principle]] of this mechanic [[philosophy]], our
institutions can never be embodied, if i may use the expression, in
persons,--so as to create in us [[love]], veneration, admiration, or
attachment. but that sort of [[reason]] which banishes the affections is
incapable of filling their place. these [[public]] affections, combined with
manners, are required sometimes as supplements, sometimes as
correctives, always as aids to [[law]]. the precept given by a [[wise]] [[man]], as
well as a [[great]] critic, for the construction of poems, is equally true
as to states:--"_non satis est pulchra esse poemata, dulcia sunto_."
there ought to be a [[system]] of manners in every nation which a
well-formed [[mind]] would be disposed to relish. to make us [[love]] our
country, our [[country]] ought to be lovely.

but [[power]], of some [[kind]] or other, will survive the shock in which
manners and opinions [[opinion]] perish; and it will find other and worse means for
its support. the usurpation, which, in order to subvert ancient
institutions, has destroyed ancient principles [[principle]], will hold [[power]] by arts
similar to those by which it has acquired it. when the old feudal and
chivalrous spirit of _fealty_, which, by freeing kings [[king]] from [[fear]], freed
both kings [[king]] and subjects [[subject]] from the precautions of [[tyranny]], shall be
extinct in the minds [[mind]] of [[men]], plots and assassinations will be
anticipated by preventive murder and preventive confiscation, and that
long roll of grim and bloody maxims [[maxim]] which form the [[political]] code of all
power not standing on its own [[honor]] and the [[honor]] of those who are to
obey it. kings [[king]] will be tyrants [[tyrant]] from policy, when subjects [[subject]] are rebels
from [[principle]].

when ancient opinions [[opinion]] and rules [[rule]] of [[life]] are taken away, the loss cannot
possibly be estimated. from that moment we have no compass to govern us,
nor can we [[know]] distinctly to what port we steer. [[europe]], undoubtedly,
taken in a mass, was in a flourishing condition the day on which your
revolution was completed. how much of that prosperous [[state]] was owing to
the spirit of our old manners and opinions [[opinion]] is not easy to say; but as
such causes cannot be indifferent in their operation, we must presume,
that, on the whole, their operation was beneficial.

we are but too apt to consider things in the [[state]] in which we find
them, without sufficiently adverting to the causes by which they have
been produced, and possibly may be upheld. nothing is more [[certain]] than
that our manners, our [[civilization]], and all the [[good]] things which are
connected with manners and with, [[civilization]], have, in this european
world of ours, depended for ages [[age]] upon two principles [[principle]], and were, indeed,
the result of both combined: i mean the spirit of a gentleman, and the
spirit of [[religion]]. the nobility and the clergy, the one by profession,
and the other by patronage, kept learning in existence, even in the
midst of arms and confusions, and whilst governments [[government]] were rather in
their causes than formed. learning paid back what it received to
nobility and to priesthood, and paid it with usury, by enlarging their
ideas, and by furnishing their minds [[mind]]. [[happy]], if they had all continued
to [[know]] their indissoluble union, and their proper place! [[happy]], if
learning, not debauched by [[ambition]], had been satisfied to continue the
instructor, and not aspired to be the master! along with its natural
protectors and guardians, learning will be cast into the mire and
trodden down under the hoofs of a swinish multitude.[93]

if, as i suspect, [[modern]] letters owe more than they are always willing
to own to ancient manners, so do other interests which we value full as
much as they are worth. even commerce, and [[trade]], and manufacture, the
gods of our economical politicians, are themselves perhaps but
creatures, are themselves but effects, which, as first causes, we choose
to [[worship]]. they certainly grew under the same shade in which learning
flourished. they, too, may decay with their [[natural]] protecting
principles. with you, for the [[present]] at least, they all threaten to
disappear together. where [[trade]] and manufactures are wanting to a
people, and the spirit of nobility and [[religion]] remains, sentiment
supplies, and not always ill supplies, their place; but if commerce and
the [[arts]] should be lost in an experiment to try how well a [[state]] may
stand without these old fundamental principles [[principle]], what sort of a thing
must be a nation of gross, stupid, ferocious, and at the same [[time]] poor
and sordid barbarians, destitute of [[religion]], [[honor]], or manly [[pride]],
possessing nothing at [[present]], and hoping for nothing hereafter?

i [[wish]] you may not be going fast, and by the shortest cut, to that
horrible and disgustful situation. already there appears a [[poverty]] of
conception, a coarseness and vulgarity, in all the proceedings of the
assembly and of all their instructors. their [[liberty]] is not liberal.
their [[science]] is presumptuous ignorance. their [[humanity]] is savage and
brutal.

it is not clear whether in [[england]] we learned those grand and decorous
principles and manners, of which considerable traces yet remain, from
you, or whether you took them from us. but to you, i [[think]], we trace
them [[best]]. you seem to me to be _gentis incunabula nostræ_. [[france]] has
always more or less influenced manners in [[england]]; and when your
fountain is choked up and polluted, the stream will not run long or not
run clear with us, or perhaps with any nation. this gives all [[europe]], in
my [[opinion]], but too close and connected a concern in what is done in
france. excuse me, therefore, if i have dwelt too long on the atrocious
spectacle of the sixth of october, 1789, or have given too much scope to
the reflections which have arisen in my [[mind]] on [[occasion]] of the most
important of all revolutions [[revolution]], which may be dated from that day: i mean a
revolution in sentiments, manners, and [[moral]] opinions [[opinion]]. as things now
stand, with everything respectable destroyed without us, and an attempt
to [[destroy]] within us every [[principle]] of [[respect]], one is almost forced to
apologize for harboring the [[common]] feelings of [[men]].

       *       *       *       *       *

why do i [[feel]] so differently from the reverend dr. price, and those of
his lay flock who will choose to adopt the sentiments of his
discourse?--for this plain [[reason]]: because it is _natural_ i should;
because we are so made as to be affected at such spectacles with
melancholy sentiments upon the unstable condition of mortal [[prosperity]],
and the tremendous uncertainty of [[human]] greatness; because in those
natural feelings we learn [[great]] lessons; because in events like these
our [[passions]] instruct our [[reason]]; because, when kings [[king]] are hurled from
their thrones by the supreme director of this [[great]] drama, and become
the objects of insult to the base and of [[pity]] to the [[good]], we behold
such disasters in the [[moral]] as we should behold a miracle in the
physical order of things. we are alarmed into reflection; our minds [[mind]] (as
it has long since been observed) are purified by terror and [[pity]]; our
weak, unthinking [[pride]] is humbled under the dispensations of a
mysterious [[wisdom]]. some tears might be drawn from me, if such a
spectacle were exhibited on the stage. i should be truly ashamed of
finding in myself that superficial, theatric sense of painted distress,
whilst i could exult over it in real [[life]]. with such a perverted [[mind]], i
could never venture to show my face at a tragedy. [[people]] would [[think]] the
tears that garrick formerly, or that siddons not long since, have
extorted from me, were the tears of hypocrisy; i should [[know]] them to be
the tears of folly.

indeed, the theatre is a [[better]] school of [[moral]] sentiments than churches
where the feelings of [[humanity]] are thus outraged. poets who have to deal
with an audience not yet graduated in the school of the rights [[right]] of [[men]],
and who must apply themselves to the [[moral]] [[constitution]] of the [[heart]],
would not dare to [[produce]] such a triumph as a matter of exultation.
there, where [[men]] [[follow]] their [[natural]] impulses, they would not bear the
odious maxims [[maxim]] of a machiavelian policy, whether applied to the
attainment of monarchical or democratic [[tyranny]]. they would reject them
on the [[modern]], as they once did on the ancient stage, where they could
not bear even the hypothetical proposition of such wickedness in the
mouth of a personated [[tyrant]], though suitable to the [[character]] he
sustained. no theatric audience in [[athens]] would bear what has been borne
in the midst of the real tragedy of this triumphal day: a principal
actor weighing, as it were in scales hung in a shop of horrors, so much
actual crime against so much contingent advantage,--and after putting in
and out weights, declaring that the balance was on the side of the
advantages. they would not bear to see the crimes of new democracy
posted as in a ledger against the crimes of old despotism, and the
book-keepers of [[politics]] finding [[democracy]] still in debt, but by no
means unable or unwilling to [[pay]] the balance. in the theatre, the first
intuitive glance, without any elaborate process of reasoning, would show
that this method of [[political]] computation would justify every extent of
crime. they would see, that, on these principles [[principle]], even where the very
worst acts were not perpetrated, it was owing rather to the [[fortune]] of
the conspirators than to their parsimony in the expenditure of treachery
and [[blood]]. they would soon see that [[criminal]] means, once tolerated, are
soon preferred. they [[present]] a shorter cut to the object than through
the highway of the [[moral]] virtues [[virtue]]. justifying perfidy and murder for
public benefit, [[public]] benefit would soon become the pretext, and
perfidy and murder the end,--until rapacity, malice, [[revenge]], and fear
more dreadful than [[revenge]], could satiate their insatiable appetites.
such must be the consequences of losing, in the splendor of these
triumphs of the rights [[right]] of [[men]], all [[natural]] sense of [[wrong]] and [[right]].

but the reverend pastor exults in this "leading in triumph," because,
truly, louis the sixteenth was "an arbitrary monarch": that is, in other
words, neither more nor less than because he was louis the sixteenth,
and because he had the misfortune to be born [[king]] of [[france]], with the
prerogatives of which a long line of [[ancestors]], and a long acquiescence
of the [[people]], without any act of his, had put him in possession. a
misfortune it has indeed turned out to him, that he was born [[king]] of
france. but misfortune is not crime, nor is indiscretion always the
greatest guilt. i shall never [[think]] that a [[prince]], the acts of whose
whole reign were a series of concessions to his subjects [[subject]], who was
willing to relax his [[authority]], to remit his prerogatives, to call his
people to a share of [[freedom]] not known, perhaps not [[desired]], by their
ancestors,--such a [[prince]], though he should be [[subject]] to the common
frailties attached to [[men]] and to princes [[prince]], though he should have once
thought it necessary to provide [[force]] against the desperate designs
manifestly carrying on against his [[person]] and the remnants of his
authority,--though all this should be taken into consideration, i shall
be [[led]] with [[great]] difficulty to [[think]] he deserves the cruel and
insulting triumph of [[paris]], and of dr. price. i tremble for the cause of
liberty, from such an [[example]] to kings [[king]]. i tremble for the cause of
humanity, in the unpunished outrages of the most wicked of [[mankind]]. but
there are some [[people]] of that low and degenerate [[fashion]] of [[mind]] that
they look up with a sort of complacent awe and admiration to kings [[king]] who
know to keep firm in their seat, to hold a strict hand over their
subjects, to assert their prerogative, and, by the awakened vigilance of
a severe despotism, to guard against the very first approaches of
freedom. against such as these they never elevate their voice. deserters
from [[principle]], listed with [[fortune]], they never see any [[good]] in
suffering [[virtue]], nor any crime in prosperous usurpation.

if it could have been made clear to me that the [[king]] and queen of france
(those, i mean, who were such before the triumph) were inexorable and
cruel tyrants [[tyrant]], that they had formed a deliberate scheme for massacring
the national assembly, (i [[think]] i have seen something like the latter
insinuated in [[certain]] publications,) i should [[think]] their captivity
just. if this be true, much more ought to have been done, but done, in
my [[opinion]], in another manner. the [[punishment]] of real tyrants [[tyrant]] is a noble
and awful act of [[justice]]; and it has with [[truth]] been said to be
consolatory to the [[human]] [[mind]]. but if i were to punish a wicked [[king]], i
should regard the [[dignity]] in avenging the crime. [[justice]] is grave and
decorous, and in its punishments [[punishment]] rather seems to submit to a necessity
than to make a [[choice]]. had nero, or agrippina, or louis the eleventh, or
charles the ninth been the [[subject]],--if charles the twelfth of sweden,
after the murder of patkul, or his predecessor, christina, after the
murder of monaldeschi, had fallen into your hands, sir, or into mine, i
am sure our conduct would have been different.

if the french [[king]], or [[king]] of the french, (or by whatever name he is
known in the new vocabulary of your [[constitution]],) has in his own person
and that of his queen really deserved these unavowed, but unavenged,
murderous attempts, and those frequent indignities more cruel than
murder, such a [[person]] would ill deserve even that subordinate executory
trust which i [[understand]] is to be placed in him; nor is he fit to be
called [[chief]] in a nation which he has outraged and [[oppressed]]. a worse
choice for such an office in a new commonwealth than that of a deposed
tyrant could not possibly be made. but to degrade and insult a [[man]] as
the worst of criminals [[criminal]], and afterwards to trust him in your highest
concerns, as a faithful, honest, and zealous servant, is not consistent
in reasoning, nor prudent in policy, nor safe in practice. those who
could make such an appointment must be guilty of a more flagrant breach
of trust than any they have yet committed against the [[people]]. as this is
the only crime in which your leading politicians could have acted
inconsistently, i conclude that there is no sort of ground for these
horrid insinuations. i [[think]] no [[better]] of all the other calumnies.

in [[england]], we give no credit to them. we are generous enemies [[enemy]]; we are
faithful allies. we spurn from us with disgust and indignation the
slanders of those who bring us their anecdotes with the attestation of
the flower-de-luce on their shoulder. we have [[lord]] george gordon fast in
newgate; and neither his being a [[public]] proselyte to judaism, nor his
having, in his zeal against catholic priests [[priest]] and all sorts of
ecclesiastics, raised a mob (excuse the term, it is still in use here)
which pulled down all our prisons, have preserved to him a [[liberty]] of
which he did not render himself worthy by a [[virtuous]] use of it. we have
rebuilt newgate, and tenanted the mansion. we have prisons almost as
strong as the bastile, for those who dare to libel the queens of [[france]].
in this [[spiritual]] retreat let the [[noble]] libeller remain. let him there
meditate on his talmud, until he learns a conduct more becoming his
birth and parts, and not so disgraceful to the ancient [[religion]] to which
he has become a proselyte,--or until some persons [[person]] from your side of the
water, to please your new [[hebrew]] brethren [[brother]], shall ransom him. he may then
be enabled to purchase, with the old hoards of the synagogue, and a very
small poundage on the long compound interest of the thirty pieces of
silver, (dr. price has shown us what [[miracles]] compound interest will
perform in 1790 years,) the lands [[land]] which are lately discovered to have
been usurped by the gallican [[church]]. send us your popish archbishop of
paris, and we will send you our protestant rabbin. we shall treat the
person you send us in exchange like a gentleman and an honest [[man]], as he
is: but [[pray]] let him bring with him the fund of his hospitality, bounty,
and charity; and, depend upon it, we shall never confiscate a shilling
of that honorable and pious fund, nor [[think]] of enriching the treasury
with the spoils of the poor-box.

to tell you the [[truth]], my dear sir, i [[think]] the [[honor]] of our nation to
be somewhat concerned in the disclaimer of the proceedings of this
society of the old jewry and the [[london]] tavern. i have no man's [[man]] proxy. i
speak only from myself, when i disclaim, as i do with all possible
earnestness, all communion with the actors in that triumph, or with the
admirers of it. when i assert anything else, as concerning the [[people]] of
england, i speak from observation, not from [[authority]]; but i speak from
the [[experience]] i have had in a pretty extensive and mixed communication
with the inhabitants of this [[kingdom]], of all descriptions and ranks, and
after a course of attentive observation, begun in early [[life]], and
continued for near forty years. i have often been astonished,
considering that we are divided from you but by a slender dike of about
twenty-four miles, and that the mutual intercourse between the two
countries has lately been very [[great]], to find how little you seem to
know of us. i suspect that this is owing to your forming a [[judgment]] of
this nation from [[certain]] publications, which do, very erroneously, if
they do at all, represent the opinions [[opinion]] and dispositions generally
prevalent in [[england]]. the vanity, restlessness, petulance, and spirit
of intrigue of several petty cabals, who attempt to hide their total
want of consequence in bustle and noise, and puffing and mutual
quotation of each other, makes you imagine that our contemptuous neglect
of their abilities is a general mark of acquiescence in their opinions [[opinion]].
no such thing, i assure you. because half a dozen grasshoppers under a
fern make the field ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands
of [[great]] cattle reposed beneath the shadow of the british oak chew the
cud and are silent, [[pray]] do not imagine that those who make the noise
are the only inhabitants of the field,--that, of course, they are many
in number,--or that, after all, they are other than the little,
shrivelled, meagre, hopping, though loud and troublesome insects of the
hour.

i almost venture to affirm that not one in a hundred amongst us
participates in the "triumph" of the [[revolution]] [[society]]. if the [[king]] and
queen of [[france]] and their [[children]] were to fall into our hands by the
chance of [[war]], in the most acrimonious of all hostilities, (i deprecate
such an event, i deprecate such hostility,) they would be treated with
another sort of triumphal entry into [[london]]. we formerly have had a king
of [[france]] in that situation: you have [[read]] how he was treated by the
victor in the field, and in what manner he was afterwards received in
england. four hundred years have gone over us; but i [[believe]] we are not
materially changed since that period. thanks to our sullen [[resistance]] to
innovation, thanks to the cold sluggishness of our national [[character]],
we still bear the stamp of our forefathers. we have not (as i conceive)
lost the generosity and [[dignity]] of thinking of the fourteenth century;
nor as yet have we subtilized ourselves into savages. we are not the
converts of [[rousseau]]; we are not the disciples of voltaire; helvetius
has made no [[progress]] amongst us. atheists are not our preachers; madmen
are not our lawgivers. we [[know]] that _we_ have made no discoveries, and
we [[think]] that no discoveries are to be made, in morality,--nor many in
the [[great]] principles [[principle]] of [[government]], nor in the ideas [[idea]] of [[liberty]], which
were understood long before we were born altogether as well as they will
be after the grave has heaped its mould upon our presumption, and the
silent tomb shall have imposed its [[law]] on our pert loquacity. in england
we have not yet been completely embowelled of our [[natural]] entrails: we
still [[feel]] within us, and we cherish and cultivate, those inbred
sentiments which are the faithful guardians, the active monitors of our
duty, the true supporters of all liberal and manly morals [[moral]]. we have not
been drawn and trussed, in order that we may be filled, like stuffed
birds in a museum, with chaff and rags, and paltry, blurred shreds of
paper about the rights [[right]] of [[man]]. we preserve the whole of our feelings
still native and entire, unsophisticated by pedantry and infidelity. we
have real hearts [[heart]] of flesh and [[blood]] beating in our bosoms. we [[fear]] [[god]];
we look up with awe to kings [[king]], with affection to parliaments, with duty
to magistrates, with reverence to priests [[priest]], and with [[respect]] to
nobility.[94] why? because, when such ideas [[idea]] are brought before our
minds, it is _natural_ to be so affected; because all other feelings are
false and spurious, and tend to [[corrupt]] our minds [[mind]], to vitiate our
primary morals [[moral]], to render us unfit for [[rational]] [[liberty]], and, by
teaching us a servile, licentious, and abandoned insolence, to be our
low [[sport]] for a few holidays, to make us perfectly fit for and justly
deserving of [[slavery]] through the whole course of our lives [[life]].

you see, sir, that in this enlightened [[age]] i am bold enough to confess
that we are generally [[men]] of untaught feelings: that, instead of casting
away all our old prejudices, we cherish them to a very considerable
degree; and, to take more shame to ourselves, we cherish them because
they are prejudices; and the longer they have lasted, and the more
generally they have prevailed, the more we cherish them. we are afraid
to put [[men]] to [[live]] and [[trade]] each on his own private stock of [[reason]];
because we suspect that the stock in each [[man]] is small, and that the
individuals would do [[better]] to avail themselves of the general bank and
capital of nations and of ages [[age]]. many of our [[men]] of speculation, instead
of exploding general prejudices, employ their sagacity to discover the
latent [[wisdom]] which prevails in them. if they find what they seek, (and
they seldom fail,) they [[think]] it more [[wise]] to continue the prejudice,
with the [[reason]] involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice, and
to leave nothing but the naked [[reason]]; because prejudice, with its
reason, has a motive to give action to that [[reason]], and an affection
which will give it permanence. prejudice is of ready application in the
emergency; it previously engages the [[mind]] in a steady course of wisdom
and [[virtue]], and does not leave the [[man]] hesitating in the moment of
decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. prejudice renders a man's
virtue his habit, and not a series of unconnected acts. through just
prejudice, his [[duty]] becomes a part of his [[nature]].

your literary [[men]], and your politicians, and so do the whole clan of the
enlightened among us, essentially differ in these points. they have no
respect for the [[wisdom]] of others; but they [[pay]] it off by a very full
measure of confidence in their own. with them it is a sufficient motive
to [[destroy]] an old scheme of things, because it is an old one. as to the
new, they are in no sort of [[fear]] with regard to the duration of a
building run up in haste; because duration is no object to those who
think little or nothing has been done before their [[time]], and who place
all their hopes [[hope]] in discovery. they conceive, very systematically, that
all things which give perpetuity are mischievous, and therefore they are
at inexpiable [[war]] with all establishments. they [[think]] that government
may vary like modes of dress, and with as little ill effect; that there
needs no [[principle]] of attachment, except a sense of [[present]] conveniency,
to any [[constitution]] of the [[state]]. they always speak as if they were of
opinion that there is a singular [[species]] of compact between them and
their magistrates, which binds the magistrate, but which has nothing
reciprocal in it, but that the majesty of the [[people]] has a [[right]] to
dissolve it without any [[reason]] but its will. their attachment to their
country itself is only so far as it agrees with some of their fleeting
projects: it begins and ends with that scheme of polity which falls in
with their momentary [[opinion]].

these doctrines, or rather sentiments, seem prevalent with your new
statesmen. but they are wholly different from those on which we have
always acted in this [[country]].

i hear it is sometimes given out in [[france]], that what is doing among you
is after the [[example]] of [[england]]. i beg leave to affirm that scarcely
anything done with you has originated from the practice or the prevalent
opinions of this [[people]], either in the act or in the spirit of the
proceeding. let me add, that we are as unwilling to learn these lessons
from [[france]] as we are sure that we never taught them to that nation. the
cabals here who take a sort of share in your transactions as yet consist
of but a handful of [[people]]. if, unfortunately, by their intrigues, their
sermons, their publications, and by a confidence derived from an
expected union with the counsels and forces [[force]] of the french nation, they
should draw considerable numbers into their faction, and in consequence
should seriously attempt anything here in imitation of what has been
done with you, the event, i dare venture to [[prophesy]], will be, that,
with some trouble to their [[country]], they will soon accomplish their own
destruction. this [[people]] refused to [[change]] their [[law]] in remote ages [[age]] from
respect to the infallibility of popes, and they will not now alter it
from a pious implicit [[faith]] in the dogmatism of [[philosophers]],--though
the former was armed with the anathema and crusade, and though the
latter should act with the libel and the lamp-iron.

formerly your affairs were your own concern only. we [[felt]] for them as
men; but we kept aloof from them, because we were not [[citizens]] of
france. but when we see the model held up to ourselves, we must [[feel]] as
englishmen, and, feeling, we must provide as englishmen. your affairs,
in spite of us, are made a part of our interest,--so far at least as to
keep at a distance your panacea or your plague. if it be a panacea, we
do not want it: we [[know]] the consequences of unnecessary physic. if it be
a plague, it is such a plague that the precautions of the most severe
quarantine ought to be established against it.

i hear on all hands, that a cabal, calling itself philosophic, receives
the [[glory]] of many of the late proceedings, and that their opinions [[opinion]] and
systems are the true actuating spirit of the whole of them. i have heard
of no party in [[england]], literary or [[political]], at any [[time]], known by
such a description. it is not with you composed of those [[men]], is it?
whom the vulgar, in their blunt, homely style, commonly call atheists
and infidels? if it be, i admit that we, too, have had writers of that
description, who made some noise in their day. at [[present]] they repose in
lasting oblivion. who, born within the [[last]] forty years, has [[read]] one
word of collins, and toland, and tindal, and chubb, and morgan, and that
whole [[race]] who called themselves freethinkers? who now reads
bolingbroke? who ever [[read]] him through? ask the booksellers of london
what is become of all these lights [[light]] of the [[world]]. in as few years their
few successors will go to the [[family]] vault of "all the capulets." but
whatever they were, or are, with us they were and are wholly unconnected
individuals. with us they kept the [[common]] [[nature]] of their [[kind]], and were
not gregarious. they never acted in corps, nor were known as a faction
in the [[state]], nor presumed to influence in that name or [[character]], or
for the purposes [[purpose]] of such a faction, on any of our [[public]] concerns.
whether they ought so to [[exist]], and so be permitted to act, is another
question. as such cabals have not existed in [[england]], so neither has the
spirit of them had any influence in establishing the original frame of
our [[constitution]], or in any one of the several reparations and
improvements it has undergone. the whole has been done under the
auspices, and is confirmed by the sanctions, of [[religion]] and piety. the
whole has emanated from the simplicity of our national [[character]], and
from a sort of native plainness and directness of understanding, which
for a long [[time]] characterized those [[men]] who have successively obtained
authority among us. this disposition still remains,--at least in the
great [[body]] of the [[people]].

we [[know]], and, what is [[better]], we [[feel]] inwardly, that [[religion]] is the
basis of civil [[society]], and the source of all [[good]], and of all
comfort.[95] in [[england]] we are so convinced of this, that there is no
rust of superstition, with which the accumulated absurdity of the human
mind might have crusted it over in the course of ages [[age]], that ninety-nine
in a hundred of the [[people]] of [[england]] would not prefer to impiety. we
shall never be such fools [[fool]] as to call in an [[enemy]] to the substance of any
system to remove its corruptions, to supply its defects, or to perfect
its construction. if our [[religious]] tenets should ever want a further
elucidation, we shall not call on atheism to explain them. we shall not
light up our temple from that unhallowed [[fire]]. it will be illuminated
with other lights [[light]]. it will be perfumed with other incense than the
infectious stuff which is imported by the smugglers of adulterated
metaphysics. if our ecclesiastical establishment should want a revision,
it is not avarice or rapacity, [[public]] or private, that we shall employ
for the audit or receipt or application of its consecrated [[revenue]].
violently condemning neither the [[greek]] nor the armenian, nor, since
heats are subsided, the roman [[system]] of [[religion]], we prefer the
protestant: not because we [[think]] it has less of the [[christian]] religion
in it, but because, in our [[judgment]], it has more. we are protestants,
not from indifference, but from zeal.

we [[know]], and it is our [[pride]] to [[know]], that [[man]] is by his [[constitution]] a
religious animal; that atheism is against, not only our [[reason]], but our
instincts; and that it cannot prevail long. but if, in the moment of
riot, and in a drunken delirium from the hot spirit drawn out of the
alembic of hell, which in [[france]] is now so furiously boiling, we should
uncover our nakedness, by throwing off that [[christian]] [[religion]] which has
hitherto been our boast and comfort, and one [[great]] source of
civilization amongst us, and among many other nations, we are
apprehensive (being well aware that the [[mind]] will not endure a void)
that some uncouth, pernicious, and degrading superstition might take
place of it.

for that [[reason]], before we take from our establishment the [[natural]],
human means of estimation, and give it up to contempt, as you have done,
and in doing it have incurred the penalties you well deserve to suffer,
we [[desire]] that some other may be presented to us in the place of it. we
shall then form our [[judgment]].

on these ideas [[idea]], instead of quarrelling with establishments, as some do,
who have made a [[philosophy]] and a [[religion]] of their hostility to such
institutions, we cleave closely to them. we are resolved to keep an
established [[church]], an established [[monarchy]], an established [[aristocracy]],
and an established [[democracy]], each in the [[degree]] it exists, and in no
greater. i shall show you presently how much of each of these we
possess.

it has been the misfortune (not, as these gentlemen [[think]] it, the glory)
of this [[age]], that everything is to be discussed, as if the constitution
of our [[country]] were to be always a [[subject]] rather of altercation than
enjoyment. for this [[reason]], as well as for the satisfaction of those
among you (if any such you have among you) who may [[wish]] to [[profit]] of
examples, i venture to trouble you with a few thoughts [[thought]] upon each of
these establishments. i do not [[think]] they were unwise in ancient [[rome]],
who, when they wished to new-model their laws [[law]], sent commissioners to
examine the best-constituted republics [[republic]] within their reach.

       *       *       *       *       *

first i beg leave to speak of our [[church]] establishment, which is the
first of our prejudices,--not a prejudice destitute of [[reason]], but
involving in it profound and extensive [[wisdom]]. i speak of it first. it
is first, and [[last]], and midst in our minds [[mind]]. for, taking ground on that
religious [[system]] of which we are now in possession, we continue to act
on the early received and uniformly continued sense of [[mankind]]. that
sense not only, like a [[wise]] architect, hath built up the august fabric
of states, but, like a provident proprietor, to preserve the structure
from profanation and ruin, as a [[sacred]] temple, purged from all the
impurities of fraud and [[violence]] and [[injustice]] and [[tyranny]], hath
solemnly and forever consecrated the commonwealth, and all that
officiate in it. this consecration is made, that all who administer in
the [[government]] of [[men]], in which they stand in the [[person]] of [[god]] himself,
should have high and worthy notions of their function and destination;
that their [[hope]] should be full of immortality; that they should not look
to the paltry pelf of the moment, nor to the temporary and transient
praise of the vulgar, but to a solid, permanent existence, in the
permanent part of their [[nature]], and to a permanent fame and [[glory]], in
the [[example]] they leave as a [[rich]] [[inheritance]] to the [[world]].

such sublime principles [[principle]] ought to be infused into persons [[person]] of exalted
situations, and [[religious]] establishments provided that may continually
revive and enforce them. every sort of [[moral]], every sort of civil, every
sort of [[politic]] institution, aiding the [[rational]] and [[natural]] ties that
connect the [[human]] understanding and affections to the [[divine]], are not
more than necessary, in order to build up that wonderful structure,
man,--whose prerogative it is, to be in a [[great]] [[degree]] a creature of his
own making, and who, when made as he ought to be made, is destined to
hold no trivial place in the creation. but whenever [[man]] is put over [[men]],
as the [[better]] [[nature]] ought ever to preside, in that case more
particularly he should as nearly as possible be approximated to his
perfection.

the consecration of the [[state]] by a [[state]] [[religious]] establishment is
necessary also to operate with a wholesome awe upon [[free]] [[citizens]];
because, in order to secure their [[freedom]], they must enjoy some
determinate portion of [[power]]. to them, therefore, a [[religion]] connected
with the [[state]], and with their [[duty]] towards it, becomes even more
necessary than in such societies [[society]] where the [[people]], by the terms of their
subjection, are confined to private sentiments, and the management of
their own [[family]] concerns. all persons [[person]] possessing any portion of power
ought to be strongly and awfully impressed with an [[idea]] that they act in
trust, and that they are to account for their conduct in that trust to
the one [[great]] master, author, and founder of [[society]].

this [[principle]] ought even to be more strongly impressed upon the minds
of those who compose the collective sovereignty than upon those of
single princes [[prince]]. without instruments, these princes [[prince]] can do nothing.
whoever uses instruments, in finding helps, finds also impediments.
their [[power]] is therefore by no means complete; nor are they safe in
extreme [[abuse]]. such persons [[person]], however elevated by [[flattery]], arrogance,
and self-opinion, must be sensible, that, whether covered or not by
positive [[law]], in some way or other they are accountable even here for
the [[abuse]] of their trust. if they are not cut off by a rebellion of
their [[people]], they may be strangled by the very janissaries kept for
their security against all other rebellion. thus we have seen the king
of [[france]] sold by his soldiers for an increase of [[pay]]. but where popular
authority is absolute and unrestrained, the [[people]] have an infinitely
greater, because a far [[better]] founded, confidence in their own [[power]].
they are themselves in a [[great]] measure their own instruments. they are
nearer to their objects. besides, they are less under responsibility to
one of the [[greatest]] controlling powers [[power]] on [[earth]], the sense of fame and
estimation. the share of infamy that is likely to fall to the lot of
each [[individual]] in [[public]] acts is small indeed: the operation of opinion
being in the inverse ratio to the number of those who [[abuse]] [[power]]. their
own approbation of their own acts has to them the appearance of a public
judgment in their favor. a [[perfect]] [[democracy]] is therefore the most
shameless thing in the [[world]]. as it is the most shameless, it is also
the most fearless. no [[man]] apprehends in his [[person]] that he can be made
subject to [[punishment]]. certainly the [[people]] at large never ought: for,
as all punishments [[punishment]] are for [[example]] towards the conservation of the
people at large, the [[people]] at large can never become the [[subject]] of
punishment by any [[human]] hand.[96] it is therefore of infinite importance
that they should not be [[suffered]] to imagine that their will, any more
than that of kings [[king]], is the standard of [[right]] and [[wrong]]. they ought to be
persuaded that they are full as little entitled, and far less qualified,
with safety to themselves, to use any arbitrary [[power]] whatsoever; that
therefore they are not, under a false show of [[liberty]], but in [[truth]] to
exercise an unnatural, inverted domination, tyrannically to exact from
those who officiate in the [[state]], not an entire devotion to their
interest, which is their [[right]], but an abject submission to their
occasional will: extinguishing thereby, in all those who serve them, all
moral [[principle]], all sense of [[dignity]], all use of [[judgment]], and all
consistency of [[character]]; whilst by the very same process they give
themselves up a proper, a suitable, but a most contemptible prey to the
servile [[ambition]] of popular sycophants or courtly flatterers.

when the [[people]] have emptied themselves of all the [[lust]] of selfish will,
which without [[religion]] it is utterly impossible they ever should,--when
they are conscious that they exercise, and exercise perhaps in a higher
link of the order of delegation, the [[power]] which to be legitimate must
be according to that eternal, immutable [[law]] in which will and [[reason]] are
the same,--they will be more careful how they place [[power]] in base and
incapable hands. in their nomination to office, they will not appoint to
the exercise of [[authority]] as to a pitiful [[job]], but as to a holy
function; not according to their sordid, selfish interest, nor to their
wanton caprice, nor to their arbitrary will; but they will confer that
power (which any [[man]] may well tremble to give or to receive) on those
only in whom they may discern that predominant proportion of active
virtue and [[wisdom]], taken together and fitted to the charge, such as in
the [[great]] and inevitable mixed mass of [[human]] imperfections and
infirmities is to be found.

when they are habitually convinced that no [[evil]] can be acceptable,
either in the act or the permission, to him whose essence is [[good]], they
will be [[better]] able to extirpate out of the minds [[mind]] of all magistrates,
civil, ecclesiastical, or [[military]], anything that bears the least
resemblance to a proud and lawless domination.

but one of the first and most leading principles [[principle]] on which the
commonwealth and the laws [[law]] are consecrated is lest the temporary
possessors and life-renters in it, unmindful of what they have received
from their [[ancestors]], or of what is due to their [[posterity]], should act
as if they were the entire masters; that they should not [[think]] it
amongst their rights [[right]] to cut off the entail or commit waste on the
inheritance, by destroying at their [[pleasure]] the whole original fabric
of their [[society]]: hazarding to leave to those who come after them a ruin
instead of an habitation,--and teaching these successors as little to
respect their contrivances as they had themselves respected the
institutions of their forefathers. by this unprincipled facility of
changing the [[state]] as often and as much and in as many ways as there are
floating fancies or fashions, the whole chain and continuity of the
commonwealth would be broken; no one [[generation]] could link with the
other; [[men]] would become little [[better]] than the flies of a summer.

and first of all, the [[science]] of jurisprudence, the [[pride]] of the human
intellect, which, with all its defects, redundancies, and errors, is the
collected [[reason]] of ages [[age]], combining the principles [[principle]] of original justice
with the infinite variety of [[human]] concerns, as a heap of old exploded
errors, would be no longer [[studied]]. personal self-sufficiency and
arrogance (the [[certain]] attendants upon all those who have never
experienced a [[wisdom]] greater than their own) would usurp the tribunal.
of course no [[certain]] laws [[law]], establishing invariable grounds of [[hope]] and
fear, would keep the actions of [[men]] in a [[certain]] course, or direct them
to a [[certain]] end. nothing stable in the modes of holding [[property]] or
exercising function could form a solid ground on which any parent could
speculate in the [[education]] of his offspring, or in a [[choice]] for their
future establishment in the [[world]]. no principles [[principle]] would be early worked
into the habits. as soon as the most able instructor had completed his
laborious course of institution, instead of sending forth his pupil
accomplished in a [[virtuous]] discipline fitted to procure him attention
and [[respect]] in his place in [[society]], he would find everything altered,
and that he had turned out a [[poor]] creature to the contempt and derision
of the [[world]], ignorant of the true grounds of estimation. who would
insure a tender and delicate sense of [[honor]] to beat almost with the
first pulses of the [[heart]], when no [[man]] could [[know]] what would be the test
of [[honor]] in a nation continually varying the standard of its coin? no
part of [[life]] would retain its acquisitions. barbarism with regard to
science and literature, unskilfulness with regard to [[arts]] and
manufactures, would infallibly succeed to the want of a steady education
and settled [[principle]]; and thus the commonwealth itself would in a few
generations crumble away, be disconnected into the dust and powder of
individuality, and at length dispersed to all the winds of [[heaven]].

to avoid, therefore, the evils [[evil]] of inconstancy and versatility, ten
thousand times [[time]] worse than those of obstinacy and the blindest prejudice,
we have consecrated the [[state]], that no [[man]] should approach to look into
its defects or corruptions but with due caution; that he should never
dream of beginning its reformation by its subversion; that he should
approach to the faults [[fault]] of the [[state]] as to the wounds of a [[father]], with
pious awe and trembling solicitude. by this [[wise]] prejudice we are taught
to look with [[horror]] on those [[children]] of their [[country]] who are prompt
rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces and put him into the kettle of
magicians, in hopes [[hope]] that by their poisonous weeds and wild incantations
they may regenerate the paternal [[constitution]] and renovate their
father's [[life]].

society is, indeed, a contract. subordinate contracts for objects of
mere occasional interest may be dissolved at [[pleasure]]; but the state
ought not to be considered as nothing [[better]] than a partnership
agreement in a [[trade]] of pepper and coffee, calico or tobacco, or some
other such low concern, to be taken up for a little temporary interest,
and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties. it is to be looked on
with other reverence; because it is not a partnership in things
subservient only to the gross animal existence of a temporary and
perishable [[nature]]. it is a partnership in all [[science]], a partnership in
all art [[arts]], a partnership in every [[virtue]] and in all [[perfection]]. as the
ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations [[generation]], it
becomes a partnership not only between those who are living, but between
those who are living, those who are [[dead]], and those who are to be born.
each contract of each particular [[state]] is but a clause in the great
primeval contract of eternal [[society]], linking the lower with the higher
natures, connecting the visible and invisible [[world]], according to a
fixed compact sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all physical
and all [[moral]] natures [[nature]] each in their appointed place. this [[law]] is not
subject to the will of those who, by an obligation above them, and
infinitely superior, are bound to submit their will to that [[law]]. the
municipal corporations of that universal [[kingdom]] are not morally at
liberty, at their [[pleasure]], and on their speculations of a contingent
improvement, wholly to separate and tear asunder the bands of their
subordinate [[community]], and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil,
unconnected [[chaos]] of elementary principles [[principle]]. it is the first and supreme
necessity only, a necessity that is not chosen, but chooses, a necessity
paramount to deliberation, that admits no discussion and demands no
evidence, which alone can justify a resort to [[anarchy]]. this necessity is
no exception to the [[rule]]; because this necessity itself is a part, too,
of that [[moral]] and physical disposition of things to which [[man]] must be
obedient by [[consent]] or [[force]]: but if that which is only submission to
necessity should be made the object of [[choice]], the [[law]] is broken, nature
is disobeyed, and the rebellious are outlawed, cast forth, and exiled,
from this [[world]] of [[reason]], and order, and [[peace]], and [[virtue]], and
fruitful penitence, into the antagonist [[world]] of madness, discord, [[vice]],
confusion, and unavailing [[sorrow]].

these, my dear sir, are, were, and, i [[think]], long will be, the
sentiments of not the least learned and reflecting part of this [[kingdom]].
they who are included in this description form their opinions [[opinion]] on such
grounds as such persons [[person]] ought to form them. the less inquiring receive
them from an [[authority]] which those whom providence dooms to [[live]] on
trust need not be ashamed to rely on. these two sorts of [[men]] move in the
same direction, though in a different place. they both move with the
order of the [[universe]]. they all [[know]] or [[feel]] this [[great]] ancient
truth:--"_quod illi principi et præpotenti deo qui omnem hunc mundum
regit nihil eorum quæ quidem fiant in terris acceptius quam concilia et
coetus hominum jure sociati quæ civitates appellantur_." they take this
tenet of the head and [[heart]], not from the [[great]] name which it
immediately bears, nor from the greater from whence it is derived, but
from that which alone can give true weight and sanction to any learned
opinion, the [[common]] [[nature]] and [[common]] relation of [[men]]. persuaded that
all things ought to be done with reference, and referring all to the
point of reference to which all should be directed, they think
themselves bound, not only as individuals [[individual]] in the sanctuary of the [[heart]],
or as congregated in that personal capacity, to renew the memory of
their high origin and cast, but also in their corporate [[character]] to
perform their national homage to the institutor and author and protector
of civil [[society]], without which civil [[society]] [[man]] could not by any
possibility arrive at the [[perfection]] of which his [[nature]] is capable, nor
even make a remote and faint approach to it. they conceive that he who
gave our [[nature]] to be perfected by our [[virtue]] willed also the necessary
means of its [[perfection]]: he willed, therefore, the [[state]]: he willed its
connection with the source and original archetype of all [[perfection]].
they who are convinced of this his will, which is the [[law]] of laws [[law]] and
the [[sovereign]] of sovereigns [[sovereign]], cannot [[think]] it reprehensible that this our
corporate fealty and homage, that this our recognition of a signiory
paramount, i had almost said this oblation of the [[state]] itself, as a
worthy offering on the high altar of universal [[praise]], should be
performed, as all [[public]], solemn acts are performed, in buildings, in
music, in decoration, in [[speech]], in the [[dignity]] of persons [[person]], according to
the customs of [[mankind]], taught by their [[nature]],--that is, with modest
splendor, with unassuming [[state]], with mild majesty and sober pomp. for
those purposes [[purpose]] they [[think]] some part of the [[wealth]] of the [[country]] is as
usefully employed as it can be in fomenting the luxury of individuals [[individual]].
it is the [[public]] ornament. it is the [[public]] consolation. it nourishes
the [[public]] [[hope]]. the poorest [[man]] finds his own importance and [[dignity]] in
it, whilst the [[wealth]] and [[pride]] of individuals [[individual]] at every moment makes the
man of humble rank and [[fortune]] sensible of his inferiority, and degrades
and vilifies his condition. it is for the [[man]] in humble [[life]], and to
raise his [[nature]], and to put him in [[mind]] of a [[state]] in which the
privileges of opulence will cease, when he will be [[equal]] by [[nature]], and
may be more than [[equal]] by [[virtue]], that this portion of the general
wealth of his [[country]] is employed and sanctified.

i assure you i do not aim at singularity. i give you opinions [[opinion]] which have
been accepted amongst us, from very early times [[time]] to this moment, with a
continued and general approbation, and which, indeed, are so worked into
my [[mind]] that i am unable to distinguish what i have learned from others
from the results of my own meditation.

it is on some such principles [[principle]] that the majority of the [[people]] of
england, far from thinking a [[religious]] national establishment unlawful,
hardly [[think]] it lawful to be without one. in [[france]] you are wholly
mistaken, if you do not [[believe]] us above all other things attached to
it, and beyond all other nations; and when this [[people]] has acted
unwisely and unjustifiably in its favor, (as in some instances they have
done, most certainly,) in their very errors you will at least discover
their zeal.

this [[principle]] runs through the whole [[system]] of their polity. they do
not consider their [[church]] establishment as convenient, but as essential
to their [[state]]: not as a thing heterogeneous and separable,--something
added for accommodation,--what they may either keep up or lay aside,
according to their temporary ideas [[idea]] of convenience. they consider it as
the foundation of their whole [[constitution]], with which, and with every
part of which, it holds an indissoluble union. [[church]] and [[state]] are
ideas inseparable in their minds [[mind]], and scarcely is the one ever mentioned
without mentioning the other.

our [[education]] is so formed as to confirm and fix this impression. our
education is in a manner wholly in the hands of ecclesiastics, and in
all stages from infancy to manhood. even when our [[youth]], leaving schools
and universities [[university]], enter that most important period of [[life]] which begins
to link [[experience]] and study together, and when with that view they
visit other countries [[country]], instead of old domestics whom we have seen as
governors to principal [[men]] from other parts, three fourths of those who
go abroad with our [[young]] nobility and gentlemen are ecclesiastics: not
as austere masters, nor as mere followers; but as [[friends]] and companions
of a graver [[character]], and not seldom persons [[person]] as well born as
themselves. with them, as relations, they most commonly keep up a close
connection through [[life]]. by this connection we conceive that we attach
our gentlemen to the [[church]]; and we liberalize the [[church]] by an
intercourse with the leading characters [[character]] of the [[country]].

so tenacious are we of the old ecclesiastical modes and fashions of
institution, that very little alteration has been made in them since the
fourteenth or fifteenth century: adhering in this particular, as in all
things else, to our old settled [[maxim]], never entirely nor at once to
depart from antiquity. we found these old [[institutions]], on the whole,
favorable to morality and discipline; and we [[thought]] they were
susceptible of amendment, without altering the ground. we [[thought]] that
they were capable of receiving and meliorating, and above all of
preserving, the accessions of [[science]] and literature, as the order of
providence should successively [[produce]] them. and after all, with this
gothic and monkish [[education]], (for such it is in the groundwork,) we may
put in our claim to as ample and as early a share in all the
improvements in [[science]], in [[arts]], and in literature, which have
illuminated and adorned the [[modern]] [[world]], as any other nation in [[europe]]:
we [[think]] one main cause of this improvement was our not despising the
patrimony of [[knowledge]] which was left us by our forefathers.

it is from our attachment to a [[church]] establishment, that the english
nation did not [[think]] it [[wise]] to intrust that [[great]] fundamental interest
of the whole to what they trust no part of their civil or military
public service,--that is, to the unsteady and precarious contribution of
individuals. they go further. they certainly never have [[suffered]], and
never will suffer, the fixed estate of the [[church]] to be converted into a
pension, to depend on the treasury, and to be delayed, withheld, or
perhaps to be extinguished by fiscal difficulties: which difficulties
may sometimes be pretended for [[political]] purposes [[purpose]], and are in [[fact]] often
brought on by the extravagance, negligence, and rapacity of politicians.
the [[people]] of [[england]] [[think]] that they have constitutional motives, as
well as [[religious]], against any project of turning their independent
clergy into ecclesiastical pensioners of [[state]]. they tremble for their
liberty, from the influence of a clergy dependent on the [[crown]]; they
tremble for the [[public]] tranquillity, from the disorders of a factious
clergy, if it were made to depend upon any other than the [[crown]]. they
therefore made their [[church]], like their [[king]] and their nobility,
independent.

from the [[united]] considerations of [[religion]] and constitutional policy,
from their [[opinion]] of a [[duty]] to make a sure provision for the
consolation of the feeble and the instruction of the ignorant, they have
incorporated and identified the estate of the [[church]] with the mass of
_private property_, of which the [[state]] is not the proprietor, either for
use or dominion, but the guardian only and the regulator. they have
ordained that the provision of this establishment might be as stable as
the [[earth]] on which it stands, and should not fluctuate with the euripus
of funds and actions.

the [[men]] of [[england]], the [[men]], i mean, of [[light]] and leading in [[england]],
whose [[wisdom]] (if they have any) is open and direct, would be ashamed, as
of a silly, deceitful trick, to profess any [[religion]] in name, which by
their proceedings they appear to contemn. if by their conduct (the only
language that rarely lies) they seemed to regard the [[great]] ruling
principle of the [[moral]] and the [[natural]] [[world]] as a mere invention to keep
the vulgar in [[obedience]], they apprehend that by such a conduct they
would defeat the [[politic]] [[purpose]] they have in view. they would find it
difficult to make others [[believe]] in a [[system]] to which they manifestly
gave no credit themselves. the [[christian]] statesmen of this [[land]] would,
indeed, first provide for the _multitude_, because it is the
_multitude_, and is therefore, as such, the first object in the
ecclesiastical institution, and in all [[institutions]]. they have been
taught that the circumstance of the gospel's being preached to the poor
was one of the [[great]] tests of its true mission. they [[think]], therefore,
that those do not [[believe]] it who do not take [[care]] it should be preached
to the [[poor]]. but as they [[know]] that charity is not confined to any one
description, but ought to apply itself to all [[men]] who have wants, they
are not deprived of a due and anxious sensation of [[pity]] to the
distresses of the miserable [[great]]. they are not repelled, through a
fastidious delicacy, at the stench of their arrogance and presumption,
from a medicinal attention to their mental blotches and running sores.
they are sensible that [[religious]] instruction is of more consequence to
them than to any others: from the greatness of the temptation to which
they are exposed; from the important consequences that attend their
faults; from the contagion of their ill [[example]]; from the necessity of
bowing down the stubborn neck of their [[pride]] and [[ambition]] to the yoke of
moderation and [[virtue]]; from a consideration of the fat stupidity and
gross ignorance concerning what imports [[men]] most to [[know]], which prevails
at courts, and at the head of armies [[army]], and in senates, as much as at the
loom and in the field.

the english [[people]] are satisfied, that to the [[great]] the consolations of
religion are as necessary as its instructions. they, too, are among the
unhappy. they [[feel]] personal [[pain]] and domestic [[sorrow]]. in these they have
no [[privilege]], but are [[subject]] to [[pay]] their full contingent to the
contributions levied on [[mortality]]. they want this [[sovereign]] balm under
their gnawing cares [[care]] and anxieties, which, being less conversant about
the limited wants of animal [[life]], range without limit, and are
diversified by infinite combinations in the wild and unbounded regions
of [[imagination]]. some charitable dole is wanting to these, our often
very unhappy brethren [[brother]], to fill the gloomy void that reigns in minds
which have nothing on [[earth]] to [[hope]] or [[fear]]; something to relieve in the
killing languor and over-labored lassitude of those who have nothing to
do; something to excite an appetite to existence in the palled satiety
which attends on all pleasures [[pleasure]] which may be bought, where [[nature]] is not
left to her own process, where even [[desire]] is anticipated, and therefore
fruition defeated by meditated schemes and contrivances of delight, and
no interval, no obstacle, is interposed between the [[wish]] and the
accomplishment.

the [[people]] of [[england]] [[know]] how little influence the teachers of religion
are likely to have with the wealthy and powerful of long standing, and
how much less with the newly fortunate, if they appear in a manner no
way assorted to those with whom they must associate, and over whom they
must even exercise, in some cases, something like an [[authority]]. what
must they [[think]] of that [[body]] of teachers, if they see it in no part
above the establishment of their domestic servants? if the [[poverty]] were
voluntary, there might be some difference. [[strong]] instances of
self-denial operate powerfully on our minds [[mind]]; and a [[man]] who has no wants
has obtained [[great]] [[freedom]] and firmness, and even [[dignity]]. but as the
mass of any description of [[men]] are but [[men]], and their [[poverty]] cannot be
voluntary, that disrespect which attends upon all lay [[poverty]] will not
depart from the ecclesiastical. our provident [[constitution]] has therefore
taken [[care]] that those who are to instruct presumptuous ignorance, those
who are to be censors over insolent [[vice]], should neither incur their
contempt nor [[live]] upon their alms; nor will it tempt the [[rich]] to a
neglect of the true medicine of their minds [[mind]]. for these reasons [[reason]], whilst
we provide first for the [[poor]], and with a parental solicitude, we have
not relegated [[religion]] (like something we were ashamed to show) to
obscure municipalities or rustic villages. no! we will have her to exalt
her mitred front in courts and parliaments. we will have her mixed
throughout the whole mass of [[life]], and blended with all the classes of
society. the [[people]] of [[england]] will show to the haughty potentates of
the [[world]], and to their talking sophisters, that a [[free]], a generous, an
informed nation honors the high magistrates of its [[church]]; that it will
not suffer the insolence of [[wealth]] and titles, or any other [[species]] of
proud pretension, to look down with scorn upon what they look up to with
reverence, nor presume to trample on that acquired personal nobility
which they intend always to be, and which often is, the fruit, not the
reward, (for what can be the [[reward]]?) of learning, piety, and [[virtue]].
they can see, without [[pain]] or grudging, an archbishop precede a duke.
they can see a bishop of durham or a bishop of winchester in possession
of ten thousand pounds a year, and cannot conceive why it is in worse
hands than estates to the like amount in the hands of this earl or that
squire; although it may be true that so many dogs and horses are not
kept by the former, and fed with the victuals which ought to nourish the
children of the [[people]]. it is true, the whole [[church]] [[revenue]] is not
always employed, and to every shilling, in charity; nor perhaps ought
it; but something is generally so employed. it is [[better]] to cherish
virtue and [[humanity]], by leaving much to [[free]] will, even with some loss
to the object, than to attempt to make [[men]] mere machines and instruments
of a [[political]] benevolence. the [[world]] on the whole will gain by a
liberty without which [[virtue]] cannot [[exist]].

when once the commonwealth has established the estates of the [[church]] as
property, it can consistently hear nothing of the more or the less. too
much and too little are [[treason]] against [[property]]. what [[evil]] can arise
from the quantity in any hand, whilst the supreme [[authority]] has the
full, [[sovereign]] superintendence over this, as over any [[property]], to
prevent every [[species]] of [[abuse]],--and whenever it notably deviates, to
give to it a direction agreeable to the purposes [[purpose]] of its institution?

in [[england]] most of us conceive that it is envy and malignity towards
those who are often the beginners of their own [[fortune]], and not a love
of the self-denial and mortification of the ancient [[church]], that makes
some look askance at the distinctions and honors and revenues [[revenue]] which,
taken from no [[person]], are set apart for [[virtue]]. the ears of the people
of [[england]] are distinguishing. they hear these [[men]] speak broad. their
tongue betrays them. their [[language]] is in the _patois_ of fraud, in the
cant and gibberish of hypocrisy. the [[people]] of [[england]] must [[think]] so,
when these praters affect to carry back the clergy to that primitive
evangelic [[poverty]] which in the spirit ought always to [[exist]] in them,
(and in us, too, however we may like it,) but in the thing must be
varied, when the relation of that [[body]] to the [[state]] is altered,--when
manners, when modes of [[life]], when indeed the whole order of human
affairs, has undergone a total [[revolution]]. we shall [[believe]] those
reformers to be then honest enthusiasts, not, as now we [[think]] them,
cheats and deceivers, when we see them throwing their own goods [[good]] into
common, and submitting their own persons [[person]] to the austere discipline of
the early [[church]].

with these ideas [[idea]] rooted in their minds [[mind]], the commons [[common]] of [[great]] [[britain]], in
the national emergencies, will never seek their resource from the
confiscation of the estates of the [[church]] and [[poor]]. sacrilege and
proscription are not among the ways and means of our committee of
supply. the [[jews]] in [[change]] alley have not yet dared to hint their hopes
of a mortgage on the revenues [[revenue]] belonging to the see of canterbury. i am
not afraid that i shall be disavowed, when i assure you that there is
not _one_ [[public]] [[man]] in this [[kingdom]], whom you [[wish]] to quote,--no, not
one, of any party or description,--who does not reprobate the dishonest,
perfidious, and cruel confiscation which the national assembly has been
compelled to make of that [[property]] which it was their first [[duty]] to
protect.

it is with the exultation of a little national [[pride]] i tell you that
those amongst us who have wished to pledge the societies [[society]] of [[paris]] in the
cup of their abominations have been disappointed. the robbery of your
church has proved a security to the possessions of ours. it has roused
the [[people]]. they see with [[horror]] and alarm that enormous and shameless
act of proscription. it has opened, and will more and more open, their
eyes upon the selfish enlargement of [[mind]] and the narrow liberality of
sentiment of insidious [[men]], which, commencing in close hypocrisy and
fraud, have ended in open [[violence]] and rapine. at [[home]] we behold similar
beginnings. we are on our guard against similar conclusions.

i [[hope]] we shall never be so totally lost to all sense of the duties
imposed upon us by the [[law]] of social union, as, upon any pretest of
public service, to confiscate the goods [[good]] of a [[single]] unoffending citizen.
who but a [[tyrant]] (a name expressive of everything which can vitiate and
degrade [[human]] nature) could [[think]] of seizing on the [[property]] of [[men]],
unaccused, unheard, untried, by whole descriptions, by hundreds and
thousands together? who that had not lost every trace of [[humanity]] could
think of casting down [[men]] of exalted rank and [[sacred]] function, some of
them of an [[age]] to call at once for reverence and compassion,--of casting
them down from the highest situation in the commonwealth, wherein they
were maintained by their own landed [[property]], to a [[state]] of indigence,
depression, and contempt?

the confiscators truly have made some allowance to their victims from
the scraps and fragments of their own tables, from which they have been
so harshly driven, and which have been so bountifully spread for a feast
to the harpies of usury. but to drive [[men]] from independence to [[live]] on
alms is itself [[great]] [[cruelty]]. that which might be a tolerable condition
to [[men]] in one [[state]] of [[life]], and not habituated to other things, may,
when all these circumstances are altered, be a dreadful [[revolution]], and
one to which a [[virtuous]] [[mind]] would [[feel]] [[pain]] in condemning any guilt,
except that which would demand the [[life]] of the offender. but to many
minds this [[punishment]] of _degradation_ and _infamy_ is worse than [[death]].
undoubtedly it is an infinite aggravation of this cruel suffering, that
the persons [[person]] who were taught a double prejudice in favor of [[religion]], by
education, and by the place they held in the administration of its
functions, are to receive the remnants of their [[property]] as alms from
the profane and impious hands of those who had plundered them of all the
rest,--to receive (if they are at all to receive) not from the
charitable contributions of the faithful, but from the insolent
tenderness of known and avowed atheism, the maintenance of [[religion]],
measured out to them on the standard of the contempt in which it is
held, and for the [[purpose]] of rendering those who receive the allowance
vile and of no estimation in the [[eyes]] of [[mankind]].

but this act of seizure of [[property]], it seems, is a [[judgment]] in [[law]], and
not a confiscation. they have, it seems, found out in the academies of
the palais [[royal]] and the jacobins, that [[certain]] [[men]] had no [[right]] to the
possessions which they held under [[law]], usage, the decisions of courts,
and the accumulated prescription of a thousand years. they say that
ecclesiastics are fictitious persons [[person]], creatures of the [[state]], whom at
pleasure they may [[destroy]], and of course limit and modify in every
particular; that the goods [[good]] they possess are not properly theirs, but
belong to the [[state]] which created the fiction; and we are therefore not
to trouble ourselves with what they may suffer in their [[natural]] feelings
and [[natural]] persons [[person]] on account of what is done towards them in this
their constructive [[character]]. of what import is it, under what names you
injure [[men]], and deprive them of the just emoluments of a profession in
which they were not only permitted, but encouraged by the [[state]] to
engage, and upon the supposed certainty of which emoluments they had
formed the plan of their lives [[life]], contracted debts, and [[led]] multitudes to
an entire dependence upon them?

you do not imagine, sir, that i am going to compliment this miserable
distinction of persons [[person]] with any long discussion. the arguments of
tyranny are as contemptible as its [[force]] is dreadful. had not your
confiscators by their early crimes obtained a [[power]] which secures
indemnity to all the crimes of which they have since been guilty, or
that they can commit, it is not the syllogism of the logician, but the
lash of the executioner, that would have refuted a sophistry which
becomes an accomplice of theft and murder. the sophistic tyrants [[tyrant]] of
paris are loud in their declamations against the departed regal tyrants
who in former ages [[age]] have vexed the [[world]]. they are thus bold, because
they are safe from the dungeons and iron cages of their old masters.
shall we be more tender of the tyrants [[tyrant]] of our own [[time]], when we see them
acting worse tragedies under our [[eyes]]? shall we not use the same liberty
that they do, when we can use it with the same safety, when to speak
honest [[truth]] only requires a contempt of the opinions [[opinion]] of those whose
actions we abhor?

this outrage on all the rights [[right]] of [[property]] was at first covered with
what, on the [[system]] of their conduct, was the most astonishing of all
pretexts,--a regard to national [[faith]]. the enemies [[enemy]] to [[property]] at first
pretended a most tender, delicate, and scrupulous [[anxiety]] for keeping
the king's engagements with the [[public]] creditor. these professors of the
rights of [[men]] are so busy in teaching others, that they have not leisure
to learn anything themselves; otherwise they would have known that it is
to the [[property]] of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor
of the [[state]], that the first and original [[faith]] of civil [[society]] is
pledged. the claim of the citizen is prior in [[time]], paramount in title,
superior in equity. the fortunes [[fortune]] of individuals [[individual]], whether possessed by
acquisition, or by descent, or in [[virtue]] of a participation in the goods
of some [[community]], were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or
implied. they never so much as entered into his head, when he made his
bargain. he well knew that the [[public]], whether represented by a monarch
or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the [[public]] estate; and it can
have no [[public]] estate, except in what it derives from a just and
proportioned imposition upon the [[citizens]] at large. this was engaged,
and nothing else could be engaged, to the [[public]] creditor. no [[man]] can
mortgage his [[injustice]] as a pawn for his fidelity.

it is impossible to avoid some observation on the contradictions, caused
by the extreme rigor and the extreme laxity of this new [[public]] [[faith]],
which influenced in this transaction, and which influenced not according
to the [[nature]] of the obligation, but to the description of the persons
to whom it was engaged. no acts of the old [[government]] of the kings [[king]] of
france are held valid in the national assembly, except its pecuniary
engagements: acts of all others of the most ambiguous legality. the rest
of the acts of that [[royal]] [[government]] are considered in so odious a light
that to have a claim under its [[authority]] is looked on as a sort of
crime. a pension, given as a [[reward]] for service to the [[state]], is surely
as [[good]] a ground of [[property]] as any security for [[money]] advanced to the
state. it is a [[better]]; for [[money]] is paid, and well paid, to obtain that
service. we have, however, seen multitudes of [[people]] under this
description in [[france]], who never had been deprived of their allowances
by the most arbitrary ministers in the most arbitrary times [[time]], by this
assembly of the rights [[right]] of [[men]] robbed without [[mercy]]. they were told, in
answer to their claim to the bread earned with their [[blood]], that their
services had not been rendered to the [[country]] that now exists.

this laxity of [[public]] [[faith]] is not confined to those unfortunate
persons. the assembly, with [[perfect]] consistency, it must be owned, is
engaged in a respectable deliberation how far it is bound by the
treaties made with other nations under the former [[government]]; and their
committee is to report which of them they ought to ratify, and which
not. by this means they have put the external fidelity of this virgin
state on a par with its internal.

it is not easy to conceive upon what [[rational]] [[principle]] the royal
government should not, of the two, rather have possessed the [[power]] of
rewarding service and making treaties, in [[virtue]] of its prerogative,
than that of pledging to creditors the [[revenue]] of the [[state]], actual and
possible. the treasure of the nation, of all things, has been the least
allowed to the prerogative of the [[king]] of [[france]], or to the prerogative
of any [[king]] in [[europe]]. to mortgage the [[public]] [[revenue]] implies the
sovereign dominion, in the fullest sense, over the [[public]] purse. it goes
far beyond the trust even of a temporary and occasional [[taxation]]. the
acts, however, of that dangerous [[power]] (the distinctive mark of a
boundless despotism) have been alone held [[sacred]]. whence arose this
preference given by a democratic assembly to a [[body]] of [[property]] deriving
its title from the most critical and obnoxious of all the exertions of
monarchical [[authority]]? [[reason]] can furnish nothing to reconcile
inconsistency; nor can partial favor be accounted for upon equitable
principles. but the contradiction and partiality which admit no
justification are not the less without an adequate cause; and that cause
i do not [[think]] it difficult to discover.

by the vast debt of [[france]] a [[great]] moneyed interest has insensibly grown
up, and with it a [[great]] [[power]]. by the ancient usages which prevailed in
that [[kingdom]], the general circulation of [[property]], and in particular the
mutual convertibility of [[land]] into [[money]] and of [[money]] into [[land]], had
always been a matter of difficulty. [[family]] settlements, rather more
general and more strict than they are in [[england]], the _jus retractûs_,
the [[great]] mass of landed [[property]] held by the [[crown]], and, by a [[maxim]] of
the french [[law]], held unalienably, the vast estates of the ecclesiastic
corporations,--all these had kept the landed and moneyed interests more
separated in [[france]], less miscible, and the owners of the two distinct
species of [[property]] not so well disposed to each other as they are in
this [[country]].

the moneyed [[property]] was long looked on with rather an [[evil]] eye by the
people. they saw it connected with their distresses, and aggravating
them. it was no less envied by the old landed interests,--partly for the
same reasons [[reason]] that rendered it obnoxious to the [[people]], but much more so
as it eclipsed, by the splendor of an ostentatious luxury, the unendowed
pedigrees and naked titles of several among the nobility. even when the
nobility, which represented the more permanent landed interest, united
themselves by [[marriage]] (which sometimes was the case) with the other
description, the [[wealth]] which saved the [[family]] from ruin was supposed to
contaminate and degrade it. thus the enmities and [[heart]] burnings of
these parties were increased even by the usual means by which discord is
made to cease and quarrels are turned into [[friendship]]. in the mean [[time]],
the [[pride]] of the wealthy [[men]], not [[noble]], or newly [[noble]], increased with
its cause. they [[felt]] with resentment an inferiority the grounds of which
they did not acknowledge. there was no measure to which they were not
willing to lend themselves, in order to be revenged of the outrages of
this rival [[pride]], and to exalt their [[wealth]] to what they considered as
its [[natural]] rank and estimation. they struck at the nobility through the
crown and the [[church]]. they attacked them particularly on the side on
which they [[thought]] them the most vulnerable,--that is, the possessions
of the [[church]], which, through the patronage of the [[crown]], generally
devolved upon the nobility. the bishoprics and the [[great]] commendatory
abbeys were, with few exceptions, held by that order.

in this [[state]] of real, though not always perceived, warfare between the
noble ancient landed interest and the new moneyed interest, the
greatest, because the most applicable, [[strength]] was in the hands of the
latter. the moneyed interest is in its [[nature]] more ready for any
adventure, and its possessors more disposed to new enterprises of any
kind. being of a recent acquisition, it falls in more naturally with any
novelties. it is therefore the [[kind]] of [[wealth]] which will be resorted to
by all who [[wish]] for [[change]].

along with the moneyed interest, a new description of [[men]] had grown up,
with whom that interest soon formed a close and marked union: i mean the
political [[men]] of letters. [[men]] of letters, fond of distinguishing
themselves, are rarely averse to innovation. since the decline of the
life and greatness of louis the fourteenth, they were not so much
cultivated either by him, or by the regent, or the successors to the
crown; nor were they engaged to the court by favors and emoluments so
systematically as during the splendid period of that ostentatious and
not impolitic reign. what they lost in the old court protection they
endeavored to make up by joining in a sort of incorporation of their
own; to which the two academies of [[france]], and afterwards the vast
undertaking of the encyclopædia, carried on by a [[society]] of these
gentlemen, did not a little contribute.

the literary cabal had some years ago formed something like a regular
plan for the destruction of the [[christian]] [[religion]]. this object they
pursued with a [[degree]] of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in
the propagators of some [[system]] of piety. they were possessed with a
spirit of proselytism in the most fanatical [[degree]],--and from thence, by
an easy [[progress]], with the spirit of persecution according to their
means.[97] what was not to be done towards their [[great]] end by any direct
or immediate act might be wrought by a longer process through the medium
of [[opinion]]. to command that [[opinion]], the first step is to establish a
dominion over those who direct it. they contrived to possess themselves,
with [[great]] method and perseverance, of all the avenues to literary fame.
many of them, indeed, stood high in the ranks of literature and [[science]].
the [[world]] had done them [[justice]], and in favor of general [[talents]] forgave
the [[evil]] tendency of their peculiar principles [[principle]]. this was true
liberality; which they returned by endeavoring to confine the reputation
of sense, learning, and taste to themselves or their followers. i will
venture to say that this narrow, exclusive spirit has not been less
prejudicial to literature and to taste than to morals [[moral]] and true
philosophy. these atheistical fathers [[father]] have a bigotry of their own; and
they have learnt to talk against monks with the spirit of a monk. but in
some things they are [[men]] of the [[world]]. the resources of intrigue are
called in to supply the defects of argument and wit. to this [[system]] of
literary [[monopoly]] was joined an unremitting industry to blacken and
discredit in every way, and by every means, all those who did not hold
to their faction. to those who have observed the spirit of their conduct
it has long been clear that nothing was wanted but the [[power]] of carrying
the intolerance of the tongue and of the pen into a persecution which
would strike at [[property]], [[liberty]], and [[life]].

the desultory and faint persecution carried on against them, more from
compliance with form and decency than with serious resentment, neither
weakened their [[strength]] nor relaxed their efforts. the issue of the
whole was, that, what with opposition, and what with [[success]], a violent
and malignant zeal, of a [[kind]] hitherto unknown in the [[world]], had taken
an entire possession of their minds [[mind]], and rendered their whole
conversation, which otherwise would have been pleasing and instructive,
perfectly disgusting. a spirit of cabal, intrigue, and proselytism
pervaded all their thoughts [[thought]], words, and actions. and as controversial
zeal soon turns its thoughts [[thought]] on [[force]], they began to insinuate
themselves into a correspondence with [[foreign]] princes [[prince]],--in hopes [[hope]],
through their [[authority]], which at first they flattered, they might
bring about the changes [[change]] they had in view. to them it was indifferent
whether these changes [[change]] were to be accomplished by the thunderbolt of
despotism or by the earthquake of popular commotion. the correspondence
between this cabal and the late [[king]] of prussia will throw no small
light upon the spirit of all their proceedings.[98] for the same purpose
for which they intrigued with princes [[prince]], they cultivated, in a
distinguished manner, the moneyed interest of [[france]]; and partly through
the means furnished by those whose peculiar offices gave them the most
extensive and [[certain]] means of communication, they carefully occupied
all the avenues to [[opinion]].

writers, especially when they act in a [[body]] and with one direction, have
great influence on the [[public]] [[mind]]; the [[alliance]], therefore, of these
writers with the moneyed interest[99] had no small effect in removing
the popular odium and envy which attended that [[species]] of [[wealth]]. these
writers, like the propagators of all novelties, pretended to a great
zeal for the [[poor]] and the lower orders, whilst in their satires they
rendered hateful, by every exaggeration, the faults [[fault]] of courts, of
nobility, and of priesthood. they became a sort of demagogues. they
served as a link to unite, in favor of one object, obnoxious [[wealth]] to
restless and desperate [[poverty]].

as these two kinds [[kind]] of [[men]] appear principal leaders in all the late
transactions, their junction and [[politics]] will serve to account, not
upon any principles [[principle]] of [[law]] or of policy, but as a _cause_, for the
general fury with which all the landed [[property]] of ecclesiastical
corporations has been attacked, and the [[great]] [[care]] which, contrary to
their pretended principles [[principle]], has been taken of a moneyed interest
originating from the [[authority]] of the [[crown]]. all the envy against wealth
and [[power]] was artificially directed against other descriptions of
riches. on what other [[principle]] than that which i have stated can we
account for an appearance so extraordinary and unnatural as that of the
ecclesiastical possessions, which had stood so many successions of ages
and shocks of civil violences, and were guarded at once by [[justice]] and
by prejudice, being applied to the payment of debts comparatively
recent, invidious, and contracted by a decried and subverted [[government]]?

was the [[public]] estate a sufficient stake for the [[public]] debts? assume
that it was not, and that a loss _must_ be incurred somewhere. when the
only estate lawfully possessed, and which the contracting parties had in
contemplation at the [[time]] in which their bargain was made, happens to
fail, who, according to the principles [[principle]] of [[natural]] and legal equity,
ought to be the sufferer? certainly it ought to be either the party who
trusted, or the party who persuaded him to trust, or both; and not third
parties who had no concern with the transaction. upon any insolvency,
they ought to suffer who were [[weak]] enough to lend upon [[bad]] security, or
they who fraudulently held out a security that was not valid. laws [[law]] are
acquainted with no other rules [[rule]] of decision. but by the new institute of
the rights [[right]] of [[men]], the only persons [[person]] who in equity ought to suffer are
the only persons [[person]] who are to be saved harmless: those are to [[answer]] the
debt who neither were lenders nor borrowers, mortgagers nor mortgagees.

what had the clergy to do with these transactions? what had they to do
with any [[public]] engagement further than the extent of their own debt? to
that, to be sure, their estates were bound to the [[last]] acre. nothing can
lead more to the true spirit of the assembly, which sits for public
confiscation with its new equity and its new morality, than an attention
to their proceeding with regard to this debt of the clergy. the [[body]] of
confiscators, true to that moneyed interest for which they were false to
every other, have found the clergy competent to incur a legal debt. of
course they declared them legally entitled to the [[property]] which their
power of incurring the debt and mortgaging the estate implied:
recognizing the rights [[right]] of those persecuted [[citizens]] in the very act in
which they were thus grossly violated.

if, as i said, any persons [[person]] are to mate [[good]] deficiencies to the public
creditor, besides the [[public]] at large, they must be those who managed
the agreement. why, therefore, are not the estates of all the
comptrollers-general confiscated?[100] why not those of the long
succession of ministers, financiers, and bankers who have been enriched
whilst the nation was impoverished by their dealings and their counsels?
why is not the estate of m. laborde declared forfeited rather than of
the archbishop of [[paris]], who has had nothing to do in the creation or in
the jobbing of the [[public]] funds? or, if you must confiscate old landed
estates in favor of the money-jobbers, why is the penalty confined to
one description? i do not [[know]] whether the expenses of the duke de
choiseul have left anything of the infinite sums which he had derived
from the bounty of his master, during the transactions of a reign which
contributed largely, by every [[species]] of prodigality in [[war]] and [[peace]],
to the [[present]] debt of [[france]]. if any such remains, why is not this
confiscated? i [[remember]] to have been in [[paris]] during the [[time]] of the old
government. i was there just after the duke d'aiguillon had been
snatched (as it was generally thought) from the block by the hand of a
protecting despotism. he was a minister, and had some concern in the
affairs of that prodigal period. why do i not see his estate delivered
up to the municipalities in which it is situated? the [[noble]] [[family]] of
noailles have long been servants (meritorious servants i admit) to the
crown of [[france]], and have had of course some share in its bounties. why
do i hear nothing of the application of their estates to the public
debt? why is the estate of the duke de rochefoucault more [[sacred]] than
that of the cardinal de rochefoucault? the former is, i [[doubt]] not, a
worthy [[person]]; and (if it were not a sort of profaneness to talk of the
use, as affecting the title to property) he makes a [[good]] use of his
revenues; but it is no disrespect to him to say, what authentic
information well warrants me in saying, that the use made of a property
equally valid, by his [[brother]],[101] the cardinal archbishop of rouen,
was far more laudable and far more public-spirited. can one hear of the
proscription of such persons [[person]], and the confiscation of their effects,
without indignation, and [[horror]]? he is not a [[man]] who does not [[feel]] such
emotions on such occasions [[occasion]]. he does not deserve the name of a [[free]] man
who will not express them.

few barbarous conquerors have ever made so terrible a [[revolution]] in
property. none of the heads of the roman factions, when they established
_crudelem illam hastam_ in all their auctions of rapine, have ever set
up to sale the goods [[good]] of the conquered citizen to such an enormous
amount. it must be allowed in favor of those tyrants [[tyrant]] of antiquity, that
what was done by them could hardly be said to be done in cold [[blood]].
their [[passions]] were inflamed, their tempers soured, their understandings
confused with the spirit of [[revenge]], with the innumerable reciprocated
and recent inflictions and retaliations of [[blood]] and rapine. they were
driven beyond all bounds of moderation by the apprehension of the return
of [[power]] with the return of [[property]] to the families [[family]] of those they had
injured beyond all [[hope]] of forgiveness.

these roman confiscators, who were yet only in the elements of [[tyranny]],
and were not instructed in the rights [[right]] of [[men]] to exercise all sorts of
cruelties on each other without provocation, [[thought]] it necessary to
spread a sort of color over their [[injustice]]. they considered the
vanquished party as composed of traitors, who had borne arms, or
otherwise had acted with hostility, against the commonwealth. they
regarded them as persons [[person]] who had forfeited their [[property]] by their
crimes. with you, in your improved [[state]] of the [[human]] [[mind]], there was no
such formality. you seized upon five millions sterling of annual rent,
and turned forty or fifty thousand [[human]] creatures out of their houses,
because "such was your [[pleasure]]." the [[tyrant]] harry the eighth of
england, as he was not [[better]] enlightened than the roman mariuses and
syllas, and had not [[studied]] in your new schools, did not [[know]] what an
effectual instrument of despotism was to be found in that grand
magazine of offensive [[weapons]], the rights [[right]] of [[men]]. when he resolved to
rob the abbeys, as the club of the jacobins have robbed all the
ecclesiastics, he began by setting on foot a commission to examine into
the crimes and abuses [[abuse]] which prevailed in those communities [[community]]. as it might
be expected, his commission reported truths [[truth]], exaggerations, and
falsehoods. but truly or falsely, it reported abuses [[abuse]] and offences.
however, as abuses [[abuse]] might be corrected, as every crime of persons [[person]] does
not infer a forfeiture with regard to communities [[community]], and as [[property]], in
that dark [[age]], was not discovered to be a creature of prejudice, all
those abuses [[abuse]] (and there were enough of them) were hardly thought
sufficient ground for such a confiscation as it was for his purposes [[purpose]] to
make. he therefore procured the formal [[surrender]] of these estates. all
these operose proceedings were adopted by one of the most decided
tyrants in the rolls of [[history]], as necessary preliminaries, before he
could venture, by bribing the members of his two servile houses with a
share of the spoil, and holding out to them an eternal immunity from
taxation, to demand a confirmation of his iniquitous proceedings by an
act of [[parliament]]. had [[fate]] reserved him to our times [[time]], four technical
terms would have done his [[business]], and saved him all this trouble; he
needed nothing more than one short form of incantation:--"_philosophy,
light, liberality, the rights [[right]] of men_."

i can say nothing in [[praise]] of those acts of [[tyranny]], which no voice has
hitherto ever commended under any of their false colors; yet in these
false colors an homage was paid by despotism to [[justice]]. the [[power]] which
was above all [[fear]] and all remorse was not set above all shame. whilst
shame keeps its watch, [[virtue]] is not wholly extinguished in the [[heart]],
nor will moderation be utterly exiled from the minds [[mind]] of tyrants [[tyrant]].

i [[believe]] every honest [[man]] sympathizes in his reflections with our
political poet on that [[occasion]], and will [[pray]] to avert the omen,
whenever these acts of rapacious despotism [[present]] themselves to his
view or his [[imagination]]:--

                      "may no such storm
    fall on our times [[time]], where rain must reform!
    tell me, my muse, what monstrous, dire offence,
    what crime could any [[christian]] [[king]] incense
    to such a rage? was't luxury, or lust
    was _he_ so temperate, so chaste, so just?
    were these their crimes? they were his own much more:
    but [[wealth]] is crime enough to him that's [[poor]]."[102]

this same [[wealth]], which is at all times [[time]] [[treason]] and _lèze-nation_ to
indigent and rapacious despotism, under all modes of polity, was your
temptation to violate [[property]], [[law]], and [[religion]], [[united]] in one
object. but was the [[state]] of [[france]] so wretched and undone, that no
other resource but rapine remained to preserve its existence? on this
point i [[wish]] to receive some information. when the states met, was the
condition of the finances of [[france]] such, that, after economizing, on
principles of [[justice]] and [[mercy]], through all departments, no fair
repartition of burdens upon all the orders could possibly restore them?
if such an [[equal]] imposition would have been sufficient, you well [[know]] it
might easily have been made. m. necker, in the budget which he laid
before the orders assembled at versailles, made a detailed exposition of
the [[state]] of the french nation.[103]

if we give credit to him, it was not necessary to have recourse to any
new impositions whatsoever, to put the receipts of [[france]] on a balance
with its expenses. he stated the permanent charges of all descriptions,
including the interest of a new loan of four hundred millions, at
531,444,000 livres; the fixed [[revenue]] at 475,294,000: making the
deficiency 56,150,000, or short of 2,200,000 _l._ sterling. but to
balance it, he brought forward savings and improvements of revenue
(considered as entirely certain) to rather more than the amount of that
deficiency; and he concludes with these emphatical words (p. 39):--"quel
pays, messieurs, que celui, où, _sans impôts_ et avec de simples objets
_inaperçus_, on peut faire disparoître un déficit qui a fait tant de
bruit en europe!" as to the reimbursement, the sinking of debt, and the
other [[great]] objects of [[public]] credit and [[political]] arrangement indicated
in monsieur necker's [[speech]], no [[doubt]] could be entertained but that a
very moderate and proportioned assessment on the [[citizens]] without
distinction would have provided for all of them to the fullest extent of
their demand.

if this representation of m. necker was false, then the assembly are in
the highest [[degree]] culpable for having forced the [[king]] to accept as his
minister, and, since the king's deposition, for having employed as
_their_ minister, a [[man]] who had been capable of abusing so notoriously
the confidence of his master and their own: in a matter, too, of the
highest moment, and directly appertaining to his particular office. but
if the representation was exact, (as, having always, along with you,
conceived a high [[degree]] of [[respect]] for m. necker, i make no [[doubt]] it
was,) then what can be said in favor of those who, instead of moderate,
reasonable, and general contribution, have in cold [[blood]], and impelled
by no necessity, had recourse to a partial and cruel confiscation?

was that contribution refused on a pretext of [[privilege]], either on the
part of the clergy, or on that of the nobility? no, certainly. as to the
clergy, they even ran before the wishes [[wish]] of the third order. previous to
the meeting of the states, they had in all their instructions expressly
directed their deputies to renounce every immunity which put them upon a
footing distinct from the condition of their fellow-subjects. in this
renunciation the clergy were even more explicit than the nobility.

but let us suppose that the deficiency had remained at the fifty-six
millions, (or 2,200,000 _l._ sterling,) as at first stated by m. necker.
let us allow that all the resources he opposed to that deficiency were
impudent and groundless fictions, and that the assembly (or their lords
of articles[104] at the jacobins) were from thence justified in laying
the whole burden of that deficiency on the clergy,--yet allowing all
this, a necessity of 2,200,000 _l._ sterling will not support a
confiscation to the amount of five millions. the imposition of 2,200,000
_l._ on the clergy, as partial, would have been oppressive and [[unjust]],
but it would not have been altogether ruinous to those on whom it was
imposed; and therefore it would not have answered the real [[purpose]] of
the managers.

perhaps persons [[person]] unacquainted with the [[state]] of [[france]], on hearing the
clergy and the noblesse were privileged in point of [[taxation]], may be led
to imagine, that, previous to the [[revolution]], these bodies [[body]] had
contributed nothing to the [[state]]. this is a [[great]] mistake. they
certainly did not contribute equally with each other, nor either of them
equally with the commons [[common]]. they both, however, contributed largely.
neither nobility nor clergy enjoyed any exemption from the excise on
consumable commodities, from duties [[duty]] of custom, or from any of the other
numerous _indirect_ impositions, which in [[france]], as well as here, make
so very large a proportion of all payments to the [[public]]. the noblesse
paid the capitation. they paid also a land-tax, called the twentieth
penny, to the height sometimes of three, sometimes of four shillings in
the pound: both of them _direct_ impositions, of no [[light]] [[nature]], and no
trivial [[produce]]. the clergy of the provinces annexed by [[conquest]] to
france (which in extent make about an eighth part of the whole, but in
wealth a much larger proportion) paid likewise to the capitation and the
twentieth penny, at the rate paid by the nobility. the clergy in the old
provinces did not [[pay]] the capitation; but they had redeemed themselves
at the expense of about twenty-four millions, or a little more than a
million sterling. they were exempted from the twentieths: but then they
made [[free]] gifts; they contracted debts for the [[state]]; and they were
subject to some other charges, the whole computed at about a thirteenth
part of their clear income. they ought to have paid annually about forty
thousand pounds more, to put them on a par with the contribution of the
nobility.

when the terrors of this tremendous proscription hung over the clergy,
they made an offer of a contribution, through the archbishop of aix,
which, for its extravagance, ought not to have been accepted. but it was
evidently and obviously more advantageous to the [[public]] creditor than
anything which could rationally be promised by the confiscation. why was
it not accepted? the [[reason]] is plain:--there was no [[desire]] that the
church should be brought to serve the [[state]]. the service of the state
was made a pretext to [[destroy]] the [[church]]. in their way to the
destruction of the [[church]] they would not scruple to [[destroy]] their
country: and they have destroyed it. one [[great]] end in the project would
have been defeated, if the plan of extortion had been adopted in lieu of
the scheme of confiscation. the new landed interest connected with the
new [[republic]], and connected with it for its very being, could not have
been created. this was among the reasons [[reason]] why that extravagant ransom was
not accepted.

the madness of the project of confiscation, on the plan that was first
pretended, soon became apparent. to bring this unwieldy mass of landed
property, enlarged by the confiscation of all the vast landed domain of
the [[crown]], at once into market was obviously to defeat the profits
proposed by the confiscation, by depreciating the value of those lands [[land]],
and indeed of all the landed estates throughout [[france]]. such a sudden
diversion of all its circulating [[money]] from [[trade]] to [[land]] must be an
additional mischief. what step was taken? did the assembly, on becoming
sensible of the inevitable ill effects of their projected sale, revert
to the offers of the clergy? no distress could oblige them to travel in
a course which was disgraced by any appearance of [[justice]]. giving over
all hopes [[hope]] from a general immediate sale, another project seems to have
succeeded. they proposed to take stock in exchange for the [[church]] lands [[land]].
in that project [[great]] difficulties arose in equalizing the objects to be
exchanged. other obstacles also presented themselves, which threw them
back again upon some project of sale. the municipalities had taken an
alarm. they would not hear of transferring the whole plunder of the
kingdom to the stockholders in [[paris]]. many of those municipalities had
been (upon system) reduced to the most deplorable indigence. [[money]] was
nowhere to be seen. they were therefore [[led]] to the point that was so
ardently [[desired]]. they panted for a currency of any [[kind]] which might
revive their perishing industry. the municipalities were, then, to be
admitted to a share in the spoil, which evidently rendered the first
scheme (if ever it had been seriously entertained) altogether
impracticable. [[public]] exigencies pressed upon all sides. the minister of
finance reiterated his call for supply with, a most urgent, anxious, and
boding voice. thus pressed on all sides, instead of the first plan of
converting their bankers into bishops and abbots, instead of paying the
old debt, they contracted a new debt, at three per cent, creating a new
paper currency, founded on an eventual sale of the [[church]] lands [[land]]. they
issued this paper currency to satisfy in the first instance chiefly the
demands made upon them by the _bank of discount_, the [[great]] machine or
paper-mill of their fictitious [[wealth]].

the spoil of the [[church]] was now become the only resource of all their
operations in finance, the vital [[principle]] of all their [[politics]], the
sole security for the existence of their [[power]]. it was necessary, by
all, even the most [[violent]] means, to put every [[individual]] on the same
bottom, and to bind the nation in one guilty interest to uphold this
act, and the [[authority]] of those by whom it was done. in order to force
the most reluctant into a participation of their pillage, they rendered
their paper circulation compulsory in all payments. those who consider
the general tendency of their schemes to this one object as a centre,
and a centre from which afterwards all their measures radiate, will not
think that i dwell too long upon this part of the proceedings of the
national assembly.

to cut off all appearance of connection between the [[crown]] and public
justice, and to bring the whole under implicit [[obedience]] to the
dictators in [[paris]], the old independent judicature of the parliaments,
with all its merits [[merit]] and all its faults [[fault]], was wholly abolished. whilst the
parliaments existed, it was evident that the [[people]] might some [[time]] or
other come to resort to them, and rally under the standard of their
ancient laws [[law]]. it became, however, a matter of consideration, that the
magistrates and officers in the courts now abolished _had purchased
their places_ at a very high rate, for which, as well as for the duty
they performed, they received but a very low return of interest. simple
confiscation is a boon only for the clergy: to the lawyers some
appearances of equity are to be observed; and they are to receive
compensation to an immense amount. their compensation becomes part of
the national debt, for the liquidation of which there is the one
exhaustless fund. the lawyers are to obtain their compensation in the
new [[church]] paper, which is to march with the new principles [[principle]] of
judicature and legislature. the dismissed magistrates are to take their
share of martyrdom with the ecclesiastics, or to receive their own
property from such a fund and in such a manner as all those who have
been seasoned with the ancient principles [[principle]] of jurisprudence, and had been
the sworn guardians of [[property]], must look upon with [[horror]]. even the
clergy are to receive their miserable allowance out of the depreciated
paper, which is stamped with the indelible [[character]] of sacrilege, and
with the symbols of their own ruin, or they must starve. so [[violent]] an
outrage upon credit, [[property]], and [[liberty]], as this compulsory paper
currency, has seldom been exhibited by the [[alliance]] of bankruptcy and
tyranny, at any [[time]], or in any nation.

in the course of all these operations, at length comes out the grand
_arcanum_,--that in reality, and in a [[fair]] sense, the lands [[land]] of the
church (so far as anything [[certain]] can be gathered from their
proceedings) are not to be sold at all. by the late resolutions of the
national assembly, they are, indeed, to be delivered to the highest
bidder. but it is to be observed, that _a [[certain]] portion only of the
purchase-money is to be laid down_. a period of twelve years is to be
given for the payment of the rest. the philosophic purchasers are
therefore, on payment of a sort of fine, to be put instantly into
possession of the estate. it becomes in some respects [[respect]] a sort of gift to
them,--to be held on the feudal tenure of zeal to the new establishment.
this project is evidently to let in a [[body]] of purchasers without [[money]].
the consequence will be, that these purchasers, or rather grantees, will
pay, not only from the rents as they accrue, which might as well be
received by the [[state]], but from the spoil of the materials of buildings,
from waste in woods, and from whatever [[money]], by hands habituated to the
gripings of usury, they can wring from the miserable peasant. he is to
be delivered over to the mercenary and arbitrary discretion of [[men]] who
will be stimulated to every [[species]] of extortion by the growing demands
on the growing profits [[profit]] of an estate held under the precarious
settlement of a new [[political]] [[system]].

when all the frauds, impostures, violences, rapines, burnings, murders,
confiscations, compulsory paper currencies, and every description of
tyranny and [[cruelty]] employed to bring about and to uphold this
revolution have their [[natural]] effect, that is, to shock the moral
sentiments of all [[virtuous]] and sober minds [[mind]], the abettors of this
philosophic [[system]] immediately strain their throats in a declamation
against the old monarchical [[government]] of [[france]]. when they have
rendered that deposed [[power]] sufficiently black, they then proceed in
argument, as if all those who disapprove of their new abuses [[abuse]] must of
course be partisans of the old,--that those who reprobate their crude
and [[violent]] schemes of [[liberty]] ought to be treated as advocates for
servitude. i admit that their necessities do compel them to this base
and contemptible fraud. nothing can reconcile [[men]] to their proceedings
and projects but the supposition that there is no third option between
them and some [[tyranny]] as odious as can be furnished by the records of
history or by the invention of poets. this prattling of theirs hardly
deserves the name of sophistry. it is nothing but plain impudence. have
these gentlemen never heard, in the whole circle of the worlds [[world]] of theory
and practice, of anything between the despotism of the monarch and the
despotism of the multitude? have they never heard of a [[monarchy]] directed
by laws [[law]], controlled and balanced by the [[great]] hereditary [[wealth]] and
hereditary [[dignity]] of a nation, and both again controlled by a judicious
check from the [[reason]] and feeling of the [[people]] at large, acting by a
suitable and permanent organ? is it, then, impossible that a [[man]] may be
found who, without [[criminal]] ill intention or pitiable absurdity, shall
prefer such a mixed and tempered [[government]] to either of the
extremes,--and who may repute that nation to be destitute of all wisdom
and of all [[virtue]], which, having in its [[choice]] to obtain such a
government with ease, _or rather to confirm it when actually possessed_,
thought proper to commit a thousand crimes, and to [[subject]] their country
to a thousand evils [[evil]], in order to avoid it? is it, then, a [[truth]] so
universally acknowledged, that a pure [[democracy]] is the only tolerable
form into which [[human]] [[society]] can be thrown, that a [[man]] is not permitted
to hesitate about its merits [[merit]], without the suspicion of being a friend to
tyranny, that is, of being a foe to [[mankind]]?

i do not [[know]] under what description to class the [[present]] ruling
authority in [[france]]. it affects to be a pure [[democracy]], though i think
it in a direct train of becoming shortly a mischievous and ignoble
oligarchy. but for the [[present]] i admit it to be a contrivance of the
nature and effect of what it pretends to. i reprobate no form of
government merely upon abstract principles [[principle]]. there may be situations in
which the purely democratic form will become necessary. there may be
some (very few, and very particularly circumstanced) where it would be
clearly desirable. this i do not take to be the case of [[france]], or of
any other [[great]] [[country]]. until now, we have seen no examples [[example]] of
considerable democracies [[democracy]]. the ancients were [[better]] acquainted with them.
not being wholly unread in the authors who had seen the most of those
constitutions, and who [[best]] understood them, i cannot [[help]] concurring
with their [[opinion]], that an absolute [[democracy]] no more than absolute
monarchy is to be reckoned among the legitimate forms of [[government]].
they [[think]] it rather the [[corruption]] and degeneracy than the sound
constitution of a [[republic]]. if i recollect rightly, [[aristotle]] observes,
that a [[democracy]] has many striking points of resemblance with a
tyranny.[105] of this i am [[certain]], that in a [[democracy]] the majority of
the [[citizens]] is capable of exercising the most cruel oppressions upon
the minority, whenever [[strong]] divisions prevail in that [[kind]] of polity,
as they often must,--and that oppression of the minority will extend to
far greater numbers, and will be carried on with much greater fury, than
can almost ever be apprehended from the dominion of a [[single]] sceptre. in
such a popular persecution, [[individual]] sufferers are in a much more
deplorable condition than in any other. under a cruel [[prince]] they have
the balmy compassion of [[mankind]] to assuage the smart of their wounds,
they have the plaudits of the [[people]] to animate their generous constancy
under their sufferings: but those who are subjected to [[wrong]] under
multitudes are deprived of all external consolation; they seem deserted
by [[mankind]], overpowered by a conspiracy of their whole [[species]].

but admitting [[democracy]] not to have that inevitable tendency to party
tyranny which i suppose it to have, and admitting it to possess as much
good in it when unmixed as i am sure it possesses when compounded with
other forms; does [[monarchy]], on its part, contain nothing at all to
recommend it? i do not often quote bolingbroke, nor have his works [[work]] in
general left any permanent impression on my [[mind]]. he is a presumptuous
and a superficial writer. but he has one observation which in my opinion
is not without depth and solidity. he says that he prefers a [[monarchy]] to
other governments [[government]], because you can [[better]] ingraft any description of
republic on a [[monarchy]] than anything of [[monarchy]] upon the republican
forms. i [[think]] him perfectly in the [[right]]. the [[fact]] is so historically,
and it agrees well with the speculation.

i [[know]] how easy a topic it is to dwell on the faults [[fault]] of departed
greatness. by a [[revolution]] in the [[state]], the fawning sycophant of
yesterday is converted into the austere critic of the [[present]] hour. but
steady, independent minds [[mind]], when they have an object of so serious a
concern to [[mankind]] as [[government]] under their contemplation, will disdain
to assume the part of satirists and declaimers. they will [[judge]] of human
institutions as they do of [[human]] characters [[character]]. they will sort out the good
from the [[evil]], which is mixed in mortal [[institutions]] as it is in mortal
men.

your [[government]] in [[france]], though usually, and i [[think]] justly, reputed
the [[best]] of the unqualified or ill-qualified monarchies [[monarchy]], was still full
of abuses [[abuse]]. these abuses [[abuse]] accumulated in a length of [[time]], as they must
accumulate in every [[monarchy]] not under the constant inspection of a
popular representative. i am no stranger to the faults [[fault]] and defects of
the subverted [[government]] of [[france]]; and i [[think]] i am not inclined by
nature or policy to make a panegyric upon anything which is a just and
natural object of censure. but the [[question]] is not now of the vices [[vice]] of
that [[monarchy]], but of its existence. is it, then, true, that the french
government was such as to be incapable or undeserving of reform, so that
it was of absolute necessity the whole fabric should be at once pulled
down, and the area cleared for the erection of a theoretic, experimental
edifice in its place? all [[france]] was of a different [[opinion]] in the
beginning of the year 1789. the instructions to the representatives to
the states-general, from every district in that [[kingdom]], were filled
with projects for the reformation of that [[government]], without the
remotest suggestion of a design to [[destroy]] it. had such a design been
then even insinuated, i [[believe]] there would have been but one voice, and
that voice for rejecting it with scorn and [[horror]]. [[men]] have been
sometimes [[led]] by degrees [[degree]], sometimes hurried, into things of which, if
they could have seen the whole together, they never would have permitted
the most remote approach. when those instructions were given, there was
no [[question]] but that abuses [[abuse]] existed, and that they demanded a reform:
nor is there now. in the interval between the instructions and the
revolution things changed their shape; and in consequence of that
change, the true [[question]] at [[present]] is, whether those who would have
reformed or those who have destroyed are in the [[right]].

to hear some [[men]] speak of the late [[monarchy]] of [[france]], you would imagine
that they were talking of [[persia]] bleeding under the ferocious [[sword]] of
thamas kouli khân,--or at least describing the barbarous anarchic
despotism of turkey, where the finest countries [[country]] in the most genial
climates in the [[world]] are wasted by [[peace]] more than any countries [[country]] have
been worried by [[war]], where [[arts]] are unknown, where manufactures
languish, where [[science]] is extinguished, where agriculture decays, where
the [[human]] [[race]] itself melts away and perishes under the eye of the
observer. was this the case of [[france]]? i have no way of determining the
question but by a reference to facts [[fact]]. facts [[fact]] do not support this
resemblance. along with much [[evil]], there is some [[good]] in monarchy
itself; and some corrective to its [[evil]] from [[religion]], from laws [[law]], from
manners, from opinions [[opinion]], the french [[monarchy]] must have received, which
rendered it (though by no means a [[free]], and therefore by no means a good
constitution) a despotism rather in appearance than in reality.

among the standards upon which the effects of [[government]] on any country
are to be estimated, i must consider the [[state]] of its [[population]] as not
the least [[certain]]. no [[country]] in which [[population]] flourishes, and is in
progressive improvement, can be under a _very_ mischievous [[government]].
about sixty years ago, the intendants of the generalities of france
made, with other matters, a report of the [[population]] of their several
districts. i have not the books [[book]], which are very voluminous, by me, nor
do i [[know]] where to procure them, (i am obliged to speak by memory, and
therefore the less positively,) but i [[think]] the [[population]] of [[france]] was
by them, even at that period, estimated at twenty-two millions of
souls. at the end of the [[last]] century it had been generally calculated
at eighteen. on either of these estimations, [[france]] was not ill-peopled.
m. necker, who is an [[authority]] for his own [[time]] at least [[equal]] to the
intendants for theirs, reckons, and upon apparently sure principles [[principle]], the
people of [[france]], in the year 1780, at twenty-four millions six hundred
and seventy thousand. but was this the probable ultimate term under the
old establishment? dr. price is of [[opinion]] that the [[growth]] of population
in [[france]] was by no means at its acme in that year. i certainly defer to
dr. price's [[authority]] a [[good]] deal more in these speculations than i do
in his general [[politics]]. this gentleman, taking ground on m. necker's
data, is very confident that since the period of that minister's
calculation the french [[population]] has increased rapidly,--so rapidly,
that in the year 1789 he will not [[consent]] to rate the [[people]] of that
kingdom at a lower number than thirty millions. after abating much (and
much i [[think]] ought to be abated) from the sanguine calculation of dr.
price, i have no [[doubt]] that the [[population]] of [[france]] did increase
considerably during this latter period: but supposing that it increased
to nothing more than will be sufficient to complete the twenty-four
millions six hundred and seventy thousand to twenty-five millions, still
a [[population]] of twenty-five millions, and that in an increasing
progress, on a space of about twenty-seven thousand square leagues, is
immense. it is, for instance, a [[good]] deal more than the proportionable
population of this island, or even than that of [[england]], the best
peopled part of the [[united]] [[kingdom]].

it is not universally true that [[france]] is a fertile [[country]].
considerable tracts of it are barren, and labor under other natural
disadvantages. in the portions of that territory where things are more
favorable, as far as i am able to discover, the numbers of the people
correspond to the indulgence of [[nature]].[106] the generality of lisle,
(this i admit is the strongest [[example]],) upon an extent of four hundred
and four leagues and a half, about ten years ago contained seven hundred
and thirty-four thousand six hundred souls [[soul]], which is one thousand seven
hundred and seventy-two inhabitants to each square league. the middle
term for the rest of [[france]] is about nine hundred inhabitants to the
same admeasurement.

i do not attribute this [[population]] to the deposed [[government]]; because i
do not like to compliment the contrivances of [[men]] with what is due in a
great [[degree]] to the bounty of providence. but that decried government
could not have obstructed, most probably it favored, the operation of
those causes, (whatever they were,) whether of [[nature]] in the soil, or
habits of industry among the [[people]], which has produced so large a
number of the [[species]] throughout that whole [[kingdom]], and exhibited in
some particular places such prodigies of [[population]]. i never will
suppose that fabric of a [[state]] to be the worst of all political
institutions which by [[experience]] is found to contain a principle
favorable (however latent it may be) to the increase of [[mankind]].

the [[wealth]] of a [[country]] is another, and no contemptible standard, by
which we may [[judge]] whether, on the whole, a [[government]] be protecting or
destructive. [[france]] far exceeds [[england]] in the multitude of her [[people]];
but i apprehend that her comparative [[wealth]] is much inferior to
ours,--that it is not so [[equal]] in the distribution, nor so ready in the
circulation. i [[believe]] the difference in the form of the two governments
to be amongst the causes of this advantage on the side of [[england]]: i
speak of [[england]], not of the whole british dominions,--which, if
compared with those of [[france]], will in some [[degree]] weaken the
comparative rate of [[wealth]] upon our side. but that [[wealth]], which will
not endure a comparison with the riches [[rich]] of [[england]], may constitute a
very respectable [[degree]] of opulence. m. necker's [[book]], published in
1785,[107] contains an accurate and interesting collection of facts
relative to [[public]] economy and to [[political]] arithmetic; and his
speculations on the [[subject]] are in general [[wise]] and liberal. in that
work he gives an [[idea]] of the [[state]] of [[france]], very remote from the
portrait of a [[country]] whose [[government]] was a [[perfect]] grievance, an
absolute [[evil]], admitting no cure but through the [[violent]] and uncertain
remedy of a total [[revolution]]. he affirms, that from the year 1726 to the
year 1784 there was coined at the mint of [[france]], in the [[species]] of gold
and silver, to the amount of about one hundred millions of pounds
sterling.[108]

it is impossible that m. necker should be mistaken in the amount of the
bullion which has been coined in the mint. it is a matter of official
record. the reasonings of this able financier concerning the quantity of
gold and silver which remained for circulation, when he wrote in 1785,
that is, about four years before the deposition and imprisonment of the
french [[king]], are not of [[equal]] certainty; but they are laid on grounds so
apparently solid, that it is not easy to refuse a considerable [[degree]] of
assent to his calculation. he calculates the _numéraire_, or what we
call _specie_, then actually existing in [[france]], at about eighty-eight
millions of the same english [[money]]. a [[great]] accumulation of [[wealth]] for
one [[country]], large as that [[country]] is! m. necker was so far from
considering this influx of [[wealth]] as likely to cease, when he wrote in
1785, that he presumes upon a future annual increase of two per cent
upon the [[money]] brought into [[france]] during the periods from which he
computed.

some adequate cause must have originally introduced all the [[money]] coined
at its mint into that [[kingdom]]; and some cause as operative must have
kept at [[home]], or returned into its bosom, such a vast flood of treasure
as m. necker calculates to remain for domestic circulation. suppose any
reasonable deductions from m. necker's computation, the remainder must
still amount to an immense sum. causes thus powerful to acquire and to
retain cannot be found in discouraged industry, insecure [[property]], and a
positively destructive [[government]]. indeed, when i consider the face of
the [[kingdom]] of [[france]], the multitude and opulence of her cities [[city]], the
useful magnificence of her spacious high-roads and bridges, the
opportunity of her artificial canals and navigations opening the
conveniences of maritime communication through a solid continent of so
immense an extent,--when i turn my [[eyes]] to the stupendous works [[work]] of her
ports and harbors, and to her whole naval apparatus, whether for [[war]] or
trade,--when i bring before my view the number of her fortifications,
constructed with so bold and masterly a [[skill]], and made and maintained
at so prodigious a charge, presenting an armed front and impenetrable
barrier to her enemies [[enemy]] upon every side,--when i recollect how very small
a part of that extensive region is without cultivation, and to what
complete [[perfection]] the [[culture]] of many of the [[best]] productions of the
earth have been brought in [[france]],--when i reflect on the excellence of
her manufactures and fabrics, second to none but ours, and in some
particulars not second,--when i contemplate the grand foundations of
charity, [[public]] and private,--when i survey the [[state]] of all the arts
that beautify and polish [[life]],--when i reckon the [[men]] she has bled for
extending her fame in [[war]], her able statesmen, the multitude of her
profound lawyers and theologians, her [[philosophers]], her critics, her
historians and antiquaries, her poets and her orators, [[sacred]] and
profane,--i behold in all this something which awes and commands the
imagination, which checks the [[mind]] on the brink of precipitate and
indiscriminate censure, and which demands that we should very seriously
examine what and how [[great]] are the latent vices [[vice]] that could authorize us
at once to level so spacious a fabric with the ground. i do not
recognize in this view of things the despotism of turkey. nor do i
discern the [[character]] of a [[government]] that has been on the whole so
oppressive, or so [[corrupt]], or so negligent, as to be utterly unfit _for
all reformation_. i must [[think]] such a [[government]] well deserved to have
its excellences heightened, its faults [[fault]] corrected, and its capacities
improved into a british [[constitution]].

whoever has examined into the proceedings of that deposed government
for several years back cannot fail to have observed, amidst the
inconstancy and fluctuation [[natural]] to courts, an earnest endeavor
towards the [[prosperity]] and improvement of the [[country]]; he must admit
that it had long been employed, in some instances wholly to remove, in
many considerably to [[correct]], the abusive practices and usages that had
prevailed in the [[state]],--and that even the unlimited [[power]] of the
sovereign over the persons [[person]] of his subjects [[subject]], inconsistent, as undoubtedly
it was, with [[law]] and [[liberty]], had yet been every day growing more
mitigated in the exercise. so far from refusing itself to reformation,
that [[government]] was open, with a censurable [[degree]] of facility, to all
sorts of projects and projectors on the [[subject]]. rather too much
countenance was given to the spirit of innovation, which soon was turned
against those who fostered it, and ended in their ruin. it is but cold,
and no very flattering [[justice]] to that fallen [[monarchy]], to say, that,
for many years, it trespassed more by levity and want of [[judgment]] in
several of its schemes than from any defect in diligence or in public
spirit. to compare the [[government]] of [[france]] for the [[last]] fifteen or
sixteen years with [[wise]] and well-constituted establishments during that,
or during any period, is not to act with fairness. but if in point of
prodigality in the expenditure of [[money]], or in point of rigor in the
exercise of [[power]], it be compared with any of the former reigns, i
believe candid judges [[judge]] will give little credit to the [[good]] intentions of
those who dwell perpetually on the donations to favorites, or on the
expenses of the court, or on the horrors of the bastile, in the reign of
louis the sixteenth.[109]

whether the [[system]], if it deserves such a name, now built on the ruins
of that ancient [[monarchy]], will be able to give a [[better]] account of the
population and [[wealth]] of the [[country]] which it has taken under its [[care]],
is a matter very doubtful. instead of improving by the [[change]], i
apprehend that a long series of years must be told, before it can
recover in any [[degree]] the effects of this philosophic [[revolution]], and
before the nation can be replaced on its former footing. if dr. price
should [[think]] fit, a few years hence, to favor us with an estimate of the
population of [[france]], he will hardly be able to make up his tale of
thirty millions of souls [[soul]], as computed in 1789, or the assembly's
computation of twenty-six millions of that year, or even m. necker's
twenty-five millions in 1780. i hear that there are considerable
emigrations from [[france]],--and that many, quitting that voluptuous
climate, and that seductive circean [[liberty]], have taken refuge in the
frozen regions and under the british despotism of canada.

in the [[present]] disappearance of coin, no [[person]] could [[think]] it the same
country in which the [[present]] minister of the finances has been able to
discover fourscore millions sterling in specie. from its general aspect
one would conclude that it had been for some [[time]] [[past]] under the special
direction of the learned academicians of laputa and balnibarbi.[110]
already the [[population]] of [[paris]] has so declined, that m. necker stated
to the national assembly the provision to be made for its subsistence
at a fifth less than what had formerly been found requisite.[111] it is
said (and i have never heard it contradicted) that a hundred thousand
people are out of employment in that [[city]], though it is become the seat
of the imprisoned court and national assembly. nothing, i am credibly
informed, can exceed the shocking and disgusting spectacle of mendicancy
displayed in that [[capital]]. indeed, the votes of the national assembly
leave no [[doubt]] of the [[fact]]. they have lately appointed a standing
committee of mendicancy. they are contriving at once a vigorous police
on this [[subject]], and, for the first [[time]], the imposition of a tax to
maintain the [[poor]], for whoso [[present]] relief [[great]] sums appear on the
face of the [[public]] accounts of the year.[112] in the mean [[time]] the
leaders of the legislative clubs and coffee-houses are intoxicated with
admiration at their own [[wisdom]] and ability. they speak with the most
sovereign contempt of the rest of the [[world]]. they toll the [[people]], to
comfort them in the rags with which they have clothed them, that they
are a nation of [[philosophers]]; and sometimes, by all the [[arts]] of
quackish parade, by show, tumult, and bustle, sometimes by the alarms
of plots and invasions, they attempt to drown the cries of indigence,
and to divert the [[eyes]] of the observer from the ruin and wretchedness of
the [[state]]. a brave [[people]] will certainly prefer [[liberty]] accompanied with
a [[virtuous]] [[poverty]] to a depraved and wealthy servitude. but before the
price of comfort and opulence is paid, one ought to be pretty sure it is
real [[liberty]] which is purchased, and that she is to be purchased at no
other price. i shall always, however, consider that [[liberty]] as very
equivocal in her appearance, which has not [[wisdom]] and [[justice]] for her
companions, and does not lead [[prosperity]] and plenty in her train.

the advocates for this [[revolution]], not satisfied with exaggerating the
vices of their ancient [[government]], strike at the fame of their country
itself, by painting almost all that could have attracted the attention
of strangers, i mean their nobility and their clergy, as objects of
horror. if this were only a libel, there had not been much in it. but it
has practical consequences. had your nobility and gentry, who formed
the [[great]] [[body]] of your landed [[men]] and the whole of your military
officers, resembled those of germany, at the period when the hanse towns
were necessitated to confederate against the nobles [[noble]] in defence of their
property,--had they been like the orsini and vitelli in [[italy]], who used
to sally from their fortified dens to rob the trader and traveller,--had
they been such as the mamelukes in [[egypt]], or the nayres on the coast of
malabar,--i do admit that too critical an inquiry might not be advisable
into the means of freeing the [[world]] from such a nuisance. the statues of
equity and [[mercy]] might be veiled for a moment. the tenderest minds [[mind]],
confounded with the dreadful exigence in which morality submits to the
suspension of its own rules [[rule]] in favor of its own principles [[principle]], might turn
aside whilst fraud and [[violence]] were accomplishing the destruction of a
pretended nobility, which disgraced, whilst it persecuted, [[human]] [[nature]].
the persons [[person]] most abhorrent from [[blood]] and [[treason]] and arbitrary
confiscation might remain silent spectators of this civil [[war]] between
the vices [[vice]].

but did the privileged nobility who met under the king's precept at
versailles in 1789, or their constituents, deserve to be looked on as
the nayres or mamelukes of this [[age]], or as the orsini and vitelli of
ancient times [[time]]? if i had then [[asked]] the [[question]], i should have passed
for a madman. what have they since done, that they were to be driven
into [[exile]], that their persons [[person]] should be hunted about, mangled, and
tortured, their families [[family]] dispersed, their houses laid in ashes, and that
their order should be abolished, and the memory of it, if possible,
extinguished, by ordaining them to [[change]] the very names by which they
were usually known? [[read]] their instructions to their representatives.
they breathe the spirit of [[liberty]] as warmly, and they recommend
reformation as strongly, as any other order. their privileges [[privilege]] relative
to contribution were voluntarily surrendered; as the [[king]], from the
beginning, surrendered all pretence to a [[right]] of [[taxation]]. upon a free
constitution there was but one [[opinion]] in [[france]]. the absolute monarchy
was at an end. it breathed its [[last]] without a groan, without struggle,
without convulsion. all the struggle, all the dissension, arose
afterwards, upon the preference of a despotic [[democracy]] to a government
of reciprocal control. the triumph of the victorious party was over the
principles of a british [[constitution]].

i have observed the affectation which for many years [[past]] has prevailed
in [[paris]], even to a [[degree]] perfectly childish, of idolizing the memory
of your henry the fourth. if anything could put any one out of humor
with that ornament to the kingly [[character]], it would be this overdone
style of insidious panegyric. the persons [[person]] who have worked this engine
the most busily are those who have ended their panegyrics in dethroning
his successor and descendant: a [[man]] as good-natured, at the least, as
henry the fourth; altogether as fond of his [[people]]; and who has done
infinitely more to [[correct]] the ancient vices [[vice]] of the [[state]] than that
great monarch did, or we are sure he ever meant to do. well it is for
his panegyrists that they have not him to deal with! for henry of
navarre was a resolute, active, and [[politic]] [[prince]]. he possessed,
indeed, [[great]] [[humanity]] and mildness, but an [[humanity]] and mildness that
never stood in the way of his interests. he never sought to be loved
without putting himself first in a condition to be feared. he used soft
language with determined conduct. he asserted and maintained his
authority in the gross, and distributed his acts of concession only in
the detail. ho spent the income of his prerogative nobly, but he took
care not to break in upon the [[capital]],--never abandoning for a moment
any of the claims which he made under the fundamental laws [[law]], nor sparing
to shed the [[blood]] of those who opposed him, often in the field,
sometimes upon the scaffold. because he knew how to make his virtues
respected by the ungrateful, he has merited the praises [[praise]] of those whom,
if they had lived in his [[time]], he would have shut up in the bastile, and
brought to [[punishment]] along with the regicides whom he [[hanged]] after he
had famished [[paris]] into a [[surrender]].

if these panegyrists are in earnest in their admiration of henry the
fourth, they must [[remember]] that they cannot [[think]] more highly of him
than he did of the noblesse of [[france]],--whose [[virtue]], [[honor]], [[courage]],
patriotism, and loyalty were his constant theme.

but the nobility of [[france]] are degenerated since the days of henry the
fourth.--this is possible; but it is more than i can [[believe]] to be true
in any [[great]] [[degree]]. i do not pretend to [[know]] [[france]] as correctly as
some others; but i have endeavored through my whole [[life]] to make myself
acquainted with [[human]] [[nature]],--otherwise i should be unfit to take even
my humble part in the service of [[mankind]]. in that study i could not pass
by a vast portion of our [[nature]] as it appeared modified in a [[country]] but
twenty-four miles from the shore of this island. on my [[best]] observation,
compared with my [[best]] inquiries, i found your nobility for the greater
part composed of [[men]] of a high spirit, and of a delicate sense of
honor, both with regard to themselves individually, and with regard to
their whole corps, over whom they kept, beyond what is [[common]] in other
countries, a censorial eye. they were tolerably well bred; very
officious, humane, and hospitable; in their conversation frank and open;
with a [[good]] [[military]] tone; and reasonably tinctured with literature,
particularly of the authors in their own [[language]]. many had pretensions
far above this description. i speak of those who were generally met
with.

as to their behavior to the inferior classes, they appeared to me to
comport themselves towards them with good-nature, and with something
more nearly approaching to familiarity than is generally practised with
us in the intercourse between the higher and lower ranks of [[life]]. to
strike any [[person]], even in the most abject condition, was a thing in a
manner unknown, and would be highly disgraceful. instances of other
ill-treatment of the humble part of the [[community]] were rare; and as to
attacks made upon the [[property]] or the personal [[liberty]] of the commons [[common]], i
never heard of any whatsoever from _them_,--nor, whilst the laws [[law]] were in
vigor under the ancient [[government]], would such [[tyranny]] in subjects [[subject]] have
been permitted. as [[men]] of landed estates, i had no [[fault]] to find with
their conduct, though much to reprehend, and much to [[wish]] changed, in
many of the old tenures. where the letting of their [[land]] was by rent, i
could not discover that their agreements with their farmers [[farmer]] were
oppressive; nor when they were in partnership with the [[farmer]], as often
was the case, have i heard that they had taken the lion's share. the
proportions seemed not inequitable. there might be exceptions; but
certainly they were exceptions only. i have no [[reason]] to [[believe]] that in
these respects [[respect]] the landed noblesse of [[france]] were worse than the landed
gentry of this [[country]],--certainly in no [[respect]] more vexatious than the
landholders, not [[noble]], of their own nation. in cities [[city]] the nobility had
no manner of [[power]]; in the [[country]] very little. you [[know]], sir, that much
of the civil [[government]], and the [[police]] in the most essential parts, was
not in the hands of that nobility which presents [[present]] itself first to our
consideration. the [[revenue]], the [[system]] and collection of which were the
most grievous parts of the french [[government]], was not administered by
the [[men]] of the [[sword]]; nor were they answerable for the vices [[vice]] of its
principle, or the vexations, where any such existed, in its management.

denying, as i am well warranted to do, that the nobility had any
considerable share in the oppression of the [[people]], in cases in which
real oppression existed, i am ready to admit that they were not without
considerable faults [[fault]] and errors. a foolish imitation of the worst part of
the manners of [[england]], which impaired their [[natural]] [[character]], without
substituting in its place what perhaps they meant to copy, has certainly
rendered them worse than formerly they were. habitual dissoluteness of
manners, continued beyond the pardonable period of [[life]], was more common
amongst them than it is with us; and it reigned with the less [[hope]] of
remedy, though possibly with something of less mischief, by being
covered with more exterior decorum. they countenanced too much that
licentious [[philosophy]] which has helped to bring on their ruin. there was
another error amongst them more fatal. those of the commons [[common]] who
approached to or exceeded many of the nobility in point of [[wealth]] were
not fully admitted to the rank and estimation which [[wealth]], in reason
and [[good]] policy, ought to bestow in every [[country]],--though i [[think]] not
equally with that of other nobility. the two kinds [[kind]] of [[aristocracy]] were
too punctiliously kept asunder: less so, however, than in germany and
some other nations.

this separation, as i have already taken the [[liberty]] of suggesting to
you, i conceive to be one principal cause of the destruction of the old
nobility. the [[military]], particularly, was too exclusively reserved for
men of [[family]]. but, after all, this was an error of [[opinion]], which a
conflicting [[opinion]] would have rectified. a permanent assembly, in which
the commons [[common]] had their share of [[power]], would soon abolish whatever was
too invidious and insulting in these distinctions; and even the faults
in the morals [[moral]] of the nobility would have been probably corrected, by the
greater varieties of occupation and pursuit to which a [[constitution]] by
orders would have given rise.

all this [[violent]] cry against the nobility i take to be a mere [[work]] of
art. to be honored and even privileged by the laws [[law]], opinions [[opinion]], and
inveterate usages of our [[country]], growing out of the prejudice of ages [[age]],
has nothing to provoke [[horror]] and indignation in any [[man]]. even to be too
tenacious of those privileges [[privilege]] is not absolutely a crime. the strong
struggle in every [[individual]] to preserve possession of what he has found
to belong to him, and to distinguish him, is one of the securities
against [[injustice]] and despotism implanted in our [[nature]]. it operates as
an instinct to secure [[property]], and to preserve communities [[community]] in a settled
state. what is there to shock in this? nobility is a graceful ornament
to the civil order. it is the corinthian [[capital]] of polished [[society]].
"_omnes boni nobilitati semper favemus_," was the saying of a [[wise]] and
good [[man]]. it is, indeed, one sign of a liberal and benevolent [[mind]] to
incline to it with some sort of partial propensity. he feels [[feel]] no
ennobling [[principle]] in his own [[heart]], who wishes [[wish]] to level all the
artificial [[institutions]] which have been adopted for giving a [[body]] to
opinion and permanence to fugitive esteem. it is a sour, malignant,
envious disposition, without taste for the reality, or for any image or
representation of [[virtue]], that sees with joy the unmerited fall of what
had long nourished in splendor and in [[honor]]. i do not like to see
anything destroyed, any void produced in [[society]], any ruin on the face
of the [[land]]. it was therefore with no disappointment or dissatisfaction
that my inquiries and observations did not [[present]] to me any
incorrigible vices [[vice]] in the noblesse of [[france]], or any [[abuse]] which could
not be removed by a reform very short of abolition. your noblesse did
not deserve [[punishment]]; but to degrade is to punish.

it was with the same satisfaction i found that the result of my inquiry
concerning your clergy was not dissimilar. it is no soothing news to my
ears, that [[great]] bodies [[body]] of [[men]] are incurably [[corrupt]]. it is not with
much credulity i listen to any, when they speak [[evil]] of those whom they
are going to plunder. i rather suspect that vices [[vice]] are feigned or
exaggerated, when [[profit]] is looked for in their [[punishment]]. an [[enemy]] is
a [[bad]] witness; a robber is a worse. vices [[vice]] and abuses [[abuse]] there were
undoubtedly in that order, and must be. it was an old establishment, and
not frequently revised. but i saw no crimes in the individuals [[individual]] that
merited confiscation of their substance, nor those cruel insults and
degradations, and that unnatural persecution, which have been
substituted in the place of meliorating regulation.

if there had been any just cause for this new religions [[religion]] persecution, the
atheistic libellers, who act as trumpeters to animate the populace to
plunder, do not [[love]] anybody so much as not to dwell with complacence on
the vices [[vice]] of the existing clergy. this they have not done. they find
themselves obliged to rake into the histories [[history]] of former ages [[age]] (which they
have ransacked with a malignant and profligate industry) for every
instance of oppression and persecution which has been made by that body
or in its favor, in order to justify, upon very iniquitous because very
illogical principles [[principle]] of retaliation, their own persecutions and their
own cruelties. after destroying all other genealogies and family
distinctions, they invent a sort of pedigree of crimes. it is not very
just to chastise [[men]] for the offences of their [[natural]] [[ancestors]]; but to
take the fiction of ancestry in a corporate succession, as a ground for
punishing [[men]] who have no relation to guilty acts, except in names and
general descriptions, is a sort of refinement in [[injustice]] belonging to
the [[philosophy]] of this enlightened [[age]]. the assembly punishes [[men]], many,
if not most, of whom abhor the [[violent]] conduct of ecclesiastics in
former times [[time]] as much as their [[present]] persecutors can do, and who would
be as loud and as [[strong]] in the expression of that sense, if they were
not well aware of the purposes [[purpose]] for which all this declamation is
employed.

corporate bodies [[body]] are [[immortal]] for the [[good]] of the members, but not for
their [[punishment]]. nations themselves are such corporations. as well
might we in [[england]] [[think]] of waging inexpiable [[war]] upon all frenchmen
for the evils [[evil]] which they have brought upon us in the several periods of
our mutual hostilities. you might, on your part, [[think]] yourselves
justified in falling upon all englishmen on account of the unparalleled
calamities brought upon the [[people]] of [[france]] by the [[unjust]] invasions of
our henrys and our edwards. indeed, we should be mutually justified in
this exterminatory [[war]] upon each other, full as much as you are in the
unprovoked persecution of your [[present]] countrymen, on account of the
conduct of [[men]] of the same name in other times [[time]].

we do not draw the [[moral]] lessons we might from [[history]]. on the contrary,
without [[care]] it may be used to vitiate our minds [[mind]] and to [[destroy]] our
happiness. in [[history]] a [[great]] volume is unrolled for our instruction,
drawing the materials of future [[wisdom]] from the [[past]] errors and
infirmities of [[mankind]]. it may, in the perversion, serve for a magazine,
furnishing offensive and defensive [[weapons]] for parties in [[church]] and
state, and supplying the means of keeping alive or reviving dissensions
and animosities, and adding fuel to civil fury. [[history]] consists, for
the greater part, of the miseries brought upon the [[world]] by [[pride]],
ambition, avarice, [[revenge]], [[lust]], sedition, hypocrisy, ungoverned zeal,
and all the train of disorderly appetites, which shake the [[public]] with
the same

            "troublous storms that toss
    the private [[state]], and render [[life]] unsweet."

these vices [[vice]] are the _causes_ of those storms. [[religion]], morals [[moral]], laws [[law]],
prerogatives, privileges [[privilege]], liberties [[liberty]], rights [[right]] of [[men]], are the _pretexts_.
the pretexts are always found in some specious appearance of a real
good. you would not secure [[men]] from [[tyranny]] and sedition by rooting out
of the [[mind]] the principles [[principle]] to which these fraudulent pretexts apply? if
you did, you would root out everything that is valuable in the human
breast. as these are the pretexts, so the ordinary actors and
instruments in [[great]] [[public]] evils [[evil]] are kings [[king]], priests [[priest]], magistrates,
senates, parliaments, national assemblies, judges [[judge]], and captains. you
would not cure the [[evil]] by resolving that there should be no more
monarchs, nor ministers of [[state]], nor of the gospel,--no interpreters of
law, no general officers, no [[public]] councils. you might [[change]] the
names: the things in some shape must remain. a [[certain]] _quantum_ of
power must always [[exist]] in the [[community]], in some hands, and under some
appellation. [[wise]] [[men]] will apply their remedies to vices [[vice]], not to
names,--to the causes of [[evil]], which are permanent, not to the
occasional organs by which they act, and the transitory modes in which
they appear. otherwise you will be [[wise]] historically, a [[fool]] in
practice. seldom have two ages [[age]] the same [[fashion]] in their pretexts, and
the same modes of mischief. wickedness is a little more inventive.
whilst you are discussing [[fashion]], the [[fashion]] is gone by. the very same
vice assumes a new [[body]]. the spirit transmigrates; and, far from losing
its [[principle]] of [[life]] by the [[change]] of its appearance, it is renovated
in its new organs with the fresh vigor of a juvenile activity. it walks
abroad, it continues its ravages, whilst you are gibbeting the carcass
or demolishing the tomb. you are terrifying yourselves with ghosts and
apparitions, whilst your house is the haunt of robbers. it is thus with
all those who, attending only to the shell and husk of [[history]], think
they are waging [[war]] with intolerance, [[pride]], and [[cruelty]], whilst, under
color of abhorring the ill principles [[principle]] of antiquated parties, they are
authorizing and feeding the same odious vices [[vice]] in different factions, and
perhaps in worse.

your [[citizens]] of [[paris]] formerly had lent themselves as the ready
instruments to slaughter the followers of calvin, at the infamous
massacre of st. bartholomew. what should we say to those who could think
of retaliating on the parisians of this day the abominations and horrors
of that [[time]]? they are, indeed, brought to abhor _that_ massacre.
ferocious as they are, it is not difficult to make them dislike it,
because the politicians and fashionable teachers have no interest in
giving their [[passions]] exactly the same direction. still, however, they
find it their interest to keep the same savage dispositions alive. it
was but the other day that they caused this very massacre to be acted on
the stage for the diversion of the descendants of those who committed
it. in this tragic farce they produced the cardinal of lorraine in his
robes of function, ordering general slaughter. was this spectacle
intended to make the parisians abhor persecution and loathe the effusion
of [[blood]]? no: it was to [[teach]] them to [[persecute]] their own [[pastors]]; it
was to excite them, by raising a disgust and [[horror]] of their clergy, to
an alacrity in hunting down to destruction an order which, if it ought
to [[exist]] at all, ought to [[exist]] not only in safety, but in reverence. it
was to stimulate their cannibal appetites (which one would [[think]] had
been gorged sufficiently) by variety and seasoning,--and to quicken them
to an alertness in new murders and massacres, if it should suit the
purpose of the guises of the day. an assembly in which sat a multitude
of priests [[priest]] and prelates was obliged to suffer this indignity at its
door. the author was not sent to the galleys, nor the players to the
house of correction. not long after this exhibition, those players came
forward to the assembly to claim the rites of that very [[religion]] which
they had dared to expose, and to show their prostituted faces in the
senate, whilst the archbishop of [[paris]], whose function was known to his
people only by his prayers and benedictions, and his [[wealth]] only by
alms, is forced to abandon his house, and to fly from his flock, (as
from ravenous wolves,) because, truly, in the sixteenth century, the
cardinal of lorraine was a rebel and a murderer.[113]

such is the effect of the perversion of [[history]] by those who, for the
same nefarious purposes [[purpose]], have perverted every other part of learning.
but those who will stand upon that elevation of [[reason]] which places
centuries under our eye and brings things to the true point of
comparison, which obscures little names and effaces the colors of little
parties, and to which nothing can ascend but the spirit and moral
quality of [[human]] actions, will say to the teachers of the palais
royal,--the cardinal of lorraine was the murderer of the sixteenth
century; you have the [[glory]] of being the murderers in the eighteenth;
and this is the only difference between you. but [[history]] in the
nineteenth century, [[better]] understood and [[better]] employed, will, i
trust, [[teach]] a civilized [[posterity]] to abhor the misdeeds of both these
barbarous ages [[age]]. it will [[teach]] future priests [[priest]] and magistrates not to
retaliate upon the speculative and inactive atheists of future times
the enormities committed by the [[present]] practical zealots and furious
fanatics of that wretched error, which, in its quiescent [[state]], is more
than punished, whenever it is embraced. it will [[teach]] [[posterity]] not to
make [[war]] upon either [[religion]] or [[philosophy]] for the [[abuse]] which the
hypocrites of both have made of the two most valuable blessings
conferred upon us by the bounty of the universal patron, who in all
things eminently favors and protects the [[race]] of [[man]].

if your clergy, or any clergy, should show themselves vicious beyond the
fair bounds allowed to [[human]] infirmity, and to those professional faults
which can hardly be separated from professional virtues [[virtue]], though their
vices never can countenance the exercise of oppression, i do admit that
they would naturally have the effect of abating very much of our
indignation against the tyrants [[tyrant]] who exceed measure and [[justice]] in their
punishment. i can allow in clergymen, through all their divisions, some
tenaciousness of their own [[opinion]], some overflowings of zeal for its
propagation, some predilection to their own [[state]] and office, some
attachment to the interest of their own corps, some preference to those
who us ten with docility to their doctrines beyond those who scorn and
deride them. i allow all this, because i am a [[man]] who have to deal with
men, and who would not, through a [[violence]] of toleration, run into the
greatest of all intolerance. i must bear with infirmities, until they
fester into crimes.

undoubtedly, the [[natural]] [[progress]] of the [[passions]], from frailty to [[vice]],
ought to be prevented by a watchful eye and a firm hand. but is it true
that the [[body]] of your clergy had passed those limits of a just
allowance? prom the general style of your late publications of all
sorts, one would be [[led]] to [[believe]] that your clergy in [[france]] were a
sort of monsters: an horrible composition of superstition, ignorance,
sloth, fraud, avarice, and [[tyranny]]. but is this true? is it true that
the lapse of [[time]], the cessation of conflicting interests, the woful
experience of the evils [[evil]] resulting from party rage, have had no sort of
influence gradually to meliorate their minds [[mind]]? is it true that they were
daily renewing invasions on the civil [[power]], troubling the domestic
quiet of their [[country]], and rendering the operations of its government
feeble and precarious? is it true that the clergy of our times [[time]] have
pressed down the laity with an iron hand, and were in all places
lighting up the fires [[fire]] of a savage persecution? did they by every fraud
endeavor to increase their estates? did they use to exceed the due
demands on estates that were their own? or, rigidly screwing up right
into [[wrong]], did they convert a legal claim into a vexatious extortion?
when not possessed of [[power]], were they filled with the vices [[vice]] of those
who envy it? were they inflamed with a [[violent]], litigious spirit of
controversy? goaded on with the [[ambition]] of intellectual sovereignty,
were they ready to fly in the face of all magistracy, to [[fire]] churches [[church]],
to massacre the priests [[priest]] of other descriptions, to pull down altars, and
to make their way over the ruins of subverted governments [[government]] to an empire
of doctrine, sometimes flattering, sometimes forcing, the consciences of
men from the jurisdiction of [[public]] [[institutions]] into a submission to
their personal [[authority]], beginning with a claim of [[liberty]] and ending
with an [[abuse]] of [[power]]?

these, or some of these, were the vices [[vice]] objected, and not wholly
without foundation, to several of the churchmen of former times [[time]], who
belonged to the two [[great]] parties which then divided and distracted
europe.

if there was in [[france]], as in other countries [[country]] there visibly is, a great
abatement, rather than any increase of these vices [[vice]], instead of loading
the [[present]] clergy with the crimes of other [[men]] and the odious character
of other times [[time]], in [[common]] equity they ought to be praised, encouraged,
and supported, in their departure from a spirit which disgraced their
predecessors, and for having assumed a temper of [[mind]] and manners more
suitable to their [[sacred]] function.

when my occasions [[occasion]] took me into [[france]], towards the close of the late
reign, the clergy, under all their forms, engaged a considerable part of
my curiosity. so far from finding (except from one set of [[men]], not then
very numerous, though very active) the complaints and discontents
against that [[body]] which some publications had given me [[reason]] to expect,
i perceived little or no [[public]] or private uneasiness on their account.
on further examination, i found the clergy, in general, persons [[person]] of
moderate minds [[mind]] and decorous manners: i include the seculars, and the
regulars of both sexes [[sex]]. i had not the [[good]] [[fortune]] to [[know]] a [[great]] many
of the parochial clergy: but in general i received a perfectly good
account of their morals [[moral]], and of their attention to their duties [[duty]]. with
some of the higher clergy i had a personal acquaintance, and of the rest
in that class a very [[good]] means of information. they were almost all of
them persons [[person]] of [[noble]] birth. they resembled others of their own rank;
and where there was any difference, it was in their favor. they were
more fully educated than the [[military]] noblesse,--so as by no means to
disgrace their profession by ignorance, or by want of fitness for the
exercise of their [[authority]]. they seemed to me, beyond the clerical
character, liberal and open, with the hearts [[heart]] of gentlemen and [[men]] of
honor, neither insolent nor servile in their manners and conduct. they
seemed to me rather a superior class,--a set of [[men]] amongst whom you
would not be surprised to find a fénelon. i saw among the clergy in
paris (many of the description are not to be met with anywhere) [[men]] of
great learning and candor; and i had [[reason]] to [[believe]] that this
description was not confined to [[paris]]. what i found in other places i
know was accidental, and therefore to be presumed a [[fair]] sample. i spent
a few days in a provincial town, where, in the absence of the bishop, i
passed my evenings with three clergymen, his vicars-general, persons [[person]] who
would have done [[honor]] to any [[church]]. they were all well-informed; two of
them of deep, general, and extensive erudition, ancient and [[modern]],
oriental and western,--particularly in their own profession. they had a
more extensive [[knowledge]] of our english divines than i expected; and
they entered into the genius of those writers with a critical accuracy.
one of these gentlemen is since [[dead]]: the abbé morangis. i [[pay]] this
tribute without reluctance to the memory of that [[noble]], reverend,
learned, and excellent [[person]]; and i should do the same with equal
cheerfulness to the merits [[merit]] of the others, who i [[believe]] are still
living, if i did not [[fear]] to hurt those whom i am unable to serve.

some of these ecclesiastics of rank are, by all titles, persons
deserving of general [[respect]]. they are deserving of gratitude from me,
and from many english. if this letter should ever come into their hands,
i [[hope]] they will [[believe]] there are those of our nation who [[feel]] for
their unmerited fall, and for the cruel confiscation of their fortunes [[fortune]],
with no [[common]] sensibility. what i say of them is a testimony, as far as
one feeble voice can go, which i owe to [[truth]]. whenever the [[question]] of
this unnatural persecution is concerned, i will [[pay]] it. no one shall
prevent me from being just and grateful. the [[time]] is fitted for the
duty; and it is particularly becoming to show our [[justice]] and gratitude,
when those who have deserved well of us and of [[mankind]] are laboring
under popular obloquy and the persecutions of oppressive [[power]].

you had before your [[revolution]] about a hundred and twenty bishops. a few
of them were [[men]] of eminent [[sanctity]], and charity without limit. when we
talk of the heroic, of course we talk of rare [[virtue]]. i [[believe]] the
instances of eminent depravity may be as rare amongst them as those of
transcendent goodness. examples [[example]] of avarice and of licentiousness may be
picked out, i do not [[question]] it, by those who delight in the
investigation which leads to such discoveries. a [[man]] as old as i am will
not be astonished that several, in every description, do not lead that
perfect [[life]] of self-denial, with regard to [[wealth]] or to [[pleasure]], which
is wished for by all, by some expected, but by none exacted with more
rigor than by those who are the most attentive to their own interests or
the most indulgent to their own [[passions]]. when i was in [[france]], i am
certain that the number of vicious prelates was not [[great]]. certain
individuals among them, not distinguishable for the regularity of their
lives, made some amends for their want of the severe virtues [[virtue]] in their
possession of the liberal, and wore endowed with qualities which made
them useful in the [[church]] and [[state]]. i am told, that, with few
exceptions, louis the sixteenth had been more attentive to [[character]], in
his promotions to that rank, than his immediate predecessor; and i
believe (as some spirit of reform has prevailed through the whole reign)
that it may be true. but the [[present]] ruling [[power]] has shown a
disposition only to plunder the [[church]]. it has punished _all_ prelates:
which is to favor the vicious, at least in point of [[reputation]]. it has
made a degrading pensionary establishment, to which no [[man]] of liberal
ideas or liberal condition will destine his [[children]]. it must settle
into the lowest classes of the [[people]]. as with you the inferior clergy
are not numerous enough for their duties [[duty]], as these duties [[duty]] are beyond
measure minute and toilsome, as you have left no middle classes of
clergy at their ease, in future nothing of [[science]] or erudition can
exist in the gallican [[church]]. to complete the project, without the least
attention to the rights [[right]] of patrons, the assembly has provided in future
an elective clergy: an arrangement which will drive out of the clerical
profession all [[men]] of sobriety, all who can pretend to independence in
their function or their conduct,--and which will throw the whole
direction of the [[public]] [[mind]] into the hands of a set of licentious,
bold, crafty, factious, flattering wretches, of such condition and such
habits of [[life]] as will make their contemptible pensions (in comparison
of which the stipend of an exciseman is lucrative and honorable) an
object of low and illiberal intrigue. those officers whom they still
call bishops are to be elected to a provision comparatively mean,
through the same [[arts]], (that is, electioneering [[arts]],) by [[men]] of all
religious tenets that are known or can be [[invented]]. the new lawgivers
have not ascertained anything whatsoever concerning their
qualifications, relative either to doctrine or to morals [[moral]], no more than
they have done with regard to the subordinate clergy; nor does it appear
but that both the higher and the lower may, at their discretion,
practise or preach any mode of [[religion]] or irreligion that they please.
i do not yet see what the jurisdiction of bishops over their
subordinates is to be, or whether they are to have any jurisdiction at
all.

in short, sir, it seems to me that this new ecclesiastical establishment
is intended only to be temporary, and preparatory to the utter
abolition, under any of its forms, of the [[christian]] [[religion]], whenever
the minds [[mind]] of [[men]] are prepared for this [[last]] stroke against it by the
accomplishment of the plan for bringing its ministers into universal
contempt. they who will not [[believe]] that the philosophical fanatics who
guide in these matters have long entertained such a design are utterly
ignorant of their [[character]] and proceedings. these enthusiasts do not
scruple to avow their [[opinion]], that a [[state]] can subsist without any
religion [[better]] than with one, and that they are able to supply the
place of any [[good]] which may be in it by a project of their own,--namely,
by a sort of [[education]] they have imagined, founded in a [[knowledge]] of the
physical wants of [[men]], progressively carried to an enlightened
self-interest, which, when well understood, they tell us, will identify
with an interest more enlarged and [[public]]. the scheme of this education
has been long known. of late they distinguish it (as they have got an
entirely new nomenclature of technical terms) by the name of a _civic
education_.

i [[hope]] their partisans in [[england]] (to whom i rather attribute very
inconsiderate conduct than the ultimate object in this detestable
design) will succeed neither in the pillage of the ecclesiastics nor in
the introduction of a [[principle]] of popular election to our bishoprics
and parochial cures. this, in the [[present]] condition of the [[world]], would
be the [[last]] [[corruption]] of the [[church]], the utter ruin of the clerical
character, the most dangerous shock that the [[state]] ever received through
a misunderstood arrangement of [[religion]]. i [[know]] well enough that the
bishoprics and cures, under kingly and seigniorial patronage, as now
they are in [[england]], and as they have been lately in [[france]], are
sometimes acquired by unworthy methods; but the other mode of
ecclesiastical canvass subjects [[subject]] them infinitely more surely and more
generally to all the [[evil]] [[arts]] of low [[ambition]], which, operating on and
through greater numbers, will [[produce]] mischief in proportion.

those of you who have robbed the clergy [[think]] that they shall easily
reconcile their conduct to all protestant nations, because the clergy
whom they have thus plundered, degraded, and given over to mockery and
scorn, are of the roman catholic, that is, of _their own_ pretended
persuasion. i have no [[doubt]] that some miserable bigots will be found
here as well as elsewhere, who hate sects and parties different from
their own more than they [[love]] the substance of [[religion]], and who are
more angry with those who differ from them in their particular plans and
systems than displeased with those who attack the foundation of our
common [[hope]]. these [[men]] will write and speak on the [[subject]] in the manner
that is to be expected from their temper and [[character]]. burnet says,
that, when he was in [[france]], in the year 1683, "the method which carried
over the [[men]] of the finest parts to popery was this: they brought
themselves to [[doubt]] of the whole [[christian]] [[religion]]: when that was once
done, it seemed a more indifferent thing of what side or form they
continued outwardly." if this was then the ecclesiastic policy of
france, it is what they have since but too much [[reason]] to repent of.
they preferred atheism to a form of [[religion]] not agreeable to their
ideas. they succeeded in destroying that form; and atheism has succeeded
in destroying them. i can readily give credit to burnet's story; because
i have observed too much of a similar spirit (for a little of it is
"much too much") amongst ourselves. the humor, however, is not general.

the teachers who reformed our [[religion]] in [[england]] bore no sort of
resemblance to your [[present]] reforming doctors in [[paris]]. perhaps they
were (like those whom they opposed) rather more than could be wished
under the influence of a party spirit; but they were most sincere
believers; [[men]] of the most fervent and exalted piety; ready to [[die]] (as
some of them did die) like true heroes in defence of their particular
ideas of [[christianity]],--as they would with [[equal]] fortitude, and more
cheerfully, for that stock of general [[truth]] for the branches of which
they contended with their [[blood]]. these [[men]] would have disavowed with
horror those wretches who claimed a fellowship with them upon no other
titles than those of their having pillaged the persons [[person]] with whom they
maintained controversies, and their having despised the [[common]] [[religion]],
for the purity of which they exerted themselves with a zeal which
unequivocally bespoke their highest reverence for the substance of that
system which they wished to reform. many of their descendants have
retained the same zeal, but (as less engaged in conflict) with more
moderation. they do not forget that [[justice]] and [[mercy]] are substantial
parts of [[religion]]. impious [[men]] do not recommend themselves to their
communion by [[iniquity]] and [[cruelty]] towards any description of their
fellow-creatures.

we hear these new teachers continually boasting of their spirit of
toleration. that those persons [[person]] should tolerate all opinions [[opinion]], who think
none to be of estimation, is a matter of small [[merit]]. [[equal]] neglect is
not [[impartial]] [[kindness]]. the [[species]] of benevolence which arises from
contempt is no true charity. there are in [[england]] abundance of [[men]] who
tolerate in the true spirit of toleration. they [[think]] the dogmas of
religion, though in different degrees [[degree]], are all of moment, and that
amongst them there is, as amongst all things of value, a just ground of
preference. they favor, therefore, and they tolerate. they tolerate, not
because they despise opinions [[opinion]], but because they [[respect]] [[justice]]. they
would reverently and affectionately [[protect]] all religions [[religion]], because they
love and venerate the [[great]] [[principle]] upon which they all agree, and the
great object to which they are all directed. they begin more and more
plainly to discern that we have all a [[common]] cause, as against a common
enemy. they will not be so misled by the spirit of faction as not to
distinguish what is done in favor of their subdivision from those acts
of hostility which, through some particular description, are aimed at
the whole corps in which they themselves, under another denomination,
are included. it is impossible for me to say what may be the character
of every description of [[men]] amongst us. but i speak for the greater
part; and for them, i must tell you, that sacrilege is no part of their
doctrine of [[good]] works [[work]]; that, so far from calling you into their
fellowship on such title, if your professors are admitted to their
communion, they must carefully conceal their doctrine of the lawfulness
of the proscription of [[innocent]] [[men]], and that they must make restitution
of all stolen goods [[good]] whatsoever. till then they are none of ours.

you may suppose that we do not approve your confiscation of the revenues
of bishops, and deans, and chapters [[chapter]], and parochial clergy possessing
independent estates arising from [[land]], because we have the same sort of
establishment in [[england]]. that objection, you will say, cannot hold as
to the confiscation of the goods [[good]] of monks and nuns, and the abolition of
their order. it is true that this particular part of your general
confiscation does not affect [[england]], as a precedent in point; but the
reason applies, and it goes a [[great]] way. the long [[parliament]] confiscated
the lands [[land]] of deans and chapters [[chapter]] in [[england]] on the same ideas [[idea]] upon which
your assembly set to sale the lands [[land]] of the monastic orders. but it is in
the [[principle]] of [[injustice]] that the danger lies [[lie]], and not in the
description of persons [[person]] on whom it is first exercised. i see, in a
country very near us, a course of policy pursued, which sets [[justice]],
the [[common]] concern of [[mankind]], at defiance. with the national assembly
of [[france]] possession is nothing, [[law]] and usage are nothing. i see the
national assembly openly reprobate the doctrine of prescription, which
one of the [[greatest]] of their own lawyers[114] tells us, with great
truth, is a part of the [[law]] of [[nature]]. he tells us that the positive
ascertainment of its limits, and its security from [[invasion]], were among
the causes for which civil [[society]] itself has been instituted. if
prescription be once shaken, no [[species]] of [[property]] is secure, when it
once becomes an object large enough to tempt the cupidity of indigent
power. i see a practice perfectly correspondent to their contempt of
this [[great]] fundamental part of [[natural]] [[law]]. i see the confiscators begin
with bishops, and chapters [[chapter]], and monasteries; but i do not see them end
there. i see the princes [[prince]] of the [[blood]], who, by the oldest usages of that
kingdom, held large landed estates, (hardly with the compliment of a
debate,) deprived of their possessions, and, in lieu of their stable,
independent [[property]], reduced to the [[hope]] of some precarious charitable
pension at the [[pleasure]] of an assembly, which of course will [[pay]] little
regard to the rights [[right]] of pensioners at [[pleasure]], when it despises those
of legal proprietors. flushed with the insolence of their first
inglorious victories [[victory]], and pressed by the distresses caused by their lust
of unhallowed lucre, disappointed, but not discouraged, they have at
length ventured completely to subvert all [[property]] of all descriptions
throughout the extent of a [[great]] [[kingdom]]. they have compelled all [[men]],
in all transactions of commerce, in the disposal of lands [[land]], in civil
dealing, and through the whole communion of [[life]], to accept, as perfect
payment and [[good]] and lawful tender, the symbols of their speculations on
a projected sale of their plunder. what vestiges of [[liberty]] or property
have they left? the tenant-right of a cabbage-garden, a year's interest
in a hovel, the good-will of an ale-house or a baker's shop, the very
shadow of a constructive [[property]], are more ceremoniously treated in our
parliament than with you the oldest and most valuable landed
possessions, in the hands of the most respectable personages, or than
the whole [[body]] of the moneyed and commercial interest of your [[country]].
we entertain a high [[opinion]] of the legislative [[authority]]; but we have
never dreamt that parliaments had any [[right]] whatever to violate
property, to overrule prescription, or to [[force]] a currency of their own
fiction in the place of that which is real, and recognized by the [[law]] of
nations. but you, who began with refusing to submit to the most moderate
restraints, have ended by establishing an unheard-of despotism. i find
the ground upon which your confiscators go is this: that, indeed, their
proceedings could not be supported in a court of [[justice]], but that the
rules of prescription cannot bind a legislative assembly.[115] so that
this legislative assembly of a [[free]] nation sits, not for the security,
but for the destruction of [[property]],--and not of [[property]] only, but of
every [[rule]] and [[maxim]] which can give it stability, and of those
instruments which can alone give it circulation.

when the anabaptists of munster, in the sixteenth century, had filled
germany with confusion, by their [[system]] of levelling, and their wild
opinions concerning [[property]], to what [[country]] in [[europe]] did not the
progress of their fury furnish just cause of alarm? of all things,
wisdom is the most terrified with epidemical fanaticism, because of all
enemies it is that against which she is the least able to furnish any
kind of resource. we cannot be ignorant of the spirit of atheistical
fanaticism, that is inspired by a multitude of writings dispersed with
incredible assiduity and expense, and by sermons delivered in all the
streets and places of [[public]] resort in [[paris]]. these writings and sermons
have filled the populace with a black and savage atrocity of [[mind]], which
supersedes in them the [[common]] feelings of [[nature]], as well as all
sentiments of morality and [[religion]]; insomuch that these wretches are
induced to bear with a sullen patience the intolerable distresses
brought upon them by the [[violent]] convulsions and permutations that have
been made in [[property]].[116] the spirit of proselytism attends this
spirit of fanaticism. they have societies [[society]] to cabal and correspond at
home and abroad for the propagation of their tenets. the [[republic]] of
berne, one of the happiest, the most prosperous, and the best-governed
countries upon [[earth]], is one of the [[great]] objects at the destruction of
which they aim. i am told they have in some measure succeeded in sowing
there the seeds of discontent. they are busy throughout germany. spain
and [[italy]] have not been untried. [[england]] is not left out of the
comprehensive scheme of their malignant charity: and in [[england]] we find
those who stretch out their arms to them, who recommend their example
from more than one pulpit, and who choose, in more than one periodical
meeting, publicly to correspond with them, to applaud them, and to hold
them up as objects for imitation; who receive from them tokens of
confraternity, and standards consecrated amidst their rites and
mysteries;[117] who suggest to them leagues of perpetual amity, at the
very [[time]] when the [[power]] to which our [[constitution]] has exclusively
delegated the federative capacity of this [[kingdom]] may find it expedient
to make [[war]] upon them.

it is not the confiscation of our [[church]] [[property]] from this [[example]] in
france that i dread, though i [[think]] this would be no trifling [[evil]]. the
great source of my solicitude is, lest it should ever be considered in
england as the policy of a [[state]] to seek a resource in confiscations of
any [[kind]], or that any one description of [[citizens]] should be brought to
regard any of the others as their proper prey.[118] nations are wading
deeper and deeper into an ocean of boundless debt. [[public]] debts, which
at first were a security to governments [[government]], by interesting many in the
public tranquillity, are likely in their excess to become the means of
their subversion. if governments [[government]] provide for these debts by heavy
impositions, they perish by becoming odious to the [[people]]. if they do
not provide for them, they will be undone by the efforts of the most
dangerous of all parties: i mean an extensive, discontented moneyed
interest, injured and not destroyed. the [[men]] who compose this interest
look for their security, in the first instance, to the fidelity of
government; in the second, to its [[power]]. if they find the old
governments effete, worn out, and with their springs relaxed, so as not
to be of sufficient vigor for their purposes [[purpose]], they may seek new ones
that shall be possessed of more energy; and this energy will be
derived, not from an acquisition of resources, but from a contempt of
justice. revolutions [[revolution]] are favorable to confiscation; and it is impossible
to [[know]] under what obnoxious names the next confiscations will be
authorized. i am sure that the principles [[principle]] predominant in [[france]] extend
to very many persons [[person]], and descriptions of persons [[person]], in all countries [[country]], who
think their innoxious indolence their security. this [[kind]] of innocence
in proprietors may be argued into inutility; and inutility into an
unfitness for their estates. many parts of [[europe]] are in open disorder.
in many others there is a hollow murmuring under ground; a confused
movement is [[felt]], that threatens a general earthquake in the political
world. already confederacies and correspondences of the most
extraordinary [[nature]] are forming in several countries [[country]].[119] in such a
state of things we ought to hold ourselves upon our guard. in all
mutations (if mutations must be) the circumstance which will serve most
to blunt the edge of their mischief, and to promote what [[good]] may be in
them, is, that they should find us with our minds [[mind]] tenacious of justice
and tender of [[property]].

but it will be argued, that this confiscation in [[france]] ought not to
alarm other nations. they say it is not made from wanton rapacity; that
it is a [[great]] measure of national policy, adopted to remove an
extensive, inveterate, [[superstitious]] mischief.--it is with the greatest
difficulty that i am able to separate policy from [[justice]]. [[justice]] is
itself the [[great]] standing policy of civil [[society]]; and any eminent
departure from it, under any circumstances, lies [[lie]] under the suspicion of
being no policy at all.

when [[men]] are encouraged to go into a [[certain]] mode of [[life]] by the
existing laws [[law]], and protected in that mode as in a lawful
occupation,--when they have accommodated all their ideas [[idea]] and all their
habits to it,--when the [[law]] had long made their adherence to its rules [[rule]] a
ground of [[reputation]], and their departure from them a ground of disgrace
and even of penalty,--i am sure it is [[unjust]] in legislature, by an
arbitrary act, to offer a sudden [[violence]] to their minds [[mind]] and their
feelings, forcibly to degrade them from their [[state]] and condition, and
to stigmatize with shame and infamy that [[character]] and those customs
which before had been made the measure of their [[happiness]] and [[honor]]. if
to this be added an expulsion from their habitations and a confiscation
of all their goods [[good]], i am not sagacious enough to discover how this
despotic [[sport]] made of the feelings, consciences, prejudices, and
properties of [[men]] can be discriminated from the rankest [[tyranny]].

if the [[injustice]] of the course pursued in [[france]] be clear, the policy of
the measure, that is, the [[public]] benefit to be expected from it, ought
to be at least as evident, and at least as important. to a [[man]] who acts
under the influence of no passion, who has nothing in view in his
projects but the [[public]] [[good]], a [[great]] difference will immediately strike
him, between what policy would dictate on the original introduction of
such [[institutions]], and on a [[question]] of their total abolition, where
they have cast their roots wide and deep, and where, by long habit,
things more valuable than themselves are so adapted to them, and in a
manner interwoven with them, that the one cannot be destroyed without
notably impairing the other. he might be embarrassed, if the case were
really such as sophisters represent it in their paltry style of
debating. but in this, as in most questions [[question]] of [[state]], there is a middle.
there is something else than the mere alternative of absolute
destruction or unreformed existence. _spartam nactus es; hanc exorna_.
this is, in my [[opinion]], a [[rule]] of profound sense, and ought never to
depart from the [[mind]] of an honest reformer. i cannot conceive how any
man can have brought himself to that pitch of presumption, to consider
his [[country]] as nothing but _carte blanche_, upon which he may scribble
whatever he pleases. a [[man]] full of warm, speculative benevolence may
wish his [[society]] otherwise constituted than he finds it; but a good
patriot, and a true politician, always considers how he shall make the
most of the existing materials of his [[country]]. a disposition to
preserve, and an ability to improve, taken together, would be my
standard of a statesman. everything else is vulgar in the conception,
perilous in the execution.

there are moments in the [[fortune]] of states, when particular [[men]] are
called to make improvements by [[great]] mental exertion. in those moments,
even when they seem to enjoy the confidence of their [[prince]] and [[country]],
and to be invested with full [[authority]], they have not always apt
instruments. a politician, to do [[great]] things, looks for a _power_, what
our workmen call a _purchase_; and if he finds that [[power]], in politics
as in mechanics, he cannot be at a loss to apply it. in the monastic
institutions, in my [[opinion]], was found a [[great]] _power_ for the mechanism
of [[politic]] benevolence. there were revenues [[revenue]] with a [[public]] direction;
there were [[men]] wholly set apart and dedicated to [[public]] purposes [[purpose]],
without any other than [[public]] ties and [[public]] principles [[principle]],--men without
the possibility of converting the estate of the [[community]] into a private
fortune,--men denied to self-interests, whose avarice is for some
community,--men to whom personal [[poverty]] is [[honor]], and implicit
obedience stands in the place of [[freedom]]. in [[vain]] shall a [[man]] look to
the possibility of making such things when he wants them. the winds blow
as they list. these [[institutions]] are the products of enthusiasm; they
are the instruments of [[wisdom]]. [[wisdom]] cannot create materials; they are
the gifts of [[nature]] or of [[chance]]; her [[pride]] is in the use. the perennial
existence of bodies [[body]] corporate and their fortunes [[fortune]] are things particularly
suited to a [[man]] who has long views,--who meditates designs that require
time in fashioning, and which propose duration when they are
accomplished. he is not deserving to rank high, or even to be mentioned
in the order of [[great]] statesmen, who, having obtained the command and
direction of such a [[power]] as existed in the [[wealth]], the discipline, and
the habits of such corporations as those which you have rashly
destroyed, cannot find any way of converting it to the [[great]] and lasting
benefit of his [[country]]. on the view of this [[subject]], a thousand uses
suggest themselves to a contriving [[mind]]. to [[destroy]] any [[power]] growing
wild from the rank productive [[force]] of the [[human]] [[mind]] is almost
tantamount, in the [[moral]] [[world]], to the destruction of the apparently
active properties [[property]] of bodies [[body]] in the material. it would be like the
attempt to [[destroy]] (if it were in our competence to destroy) the
expansive [[force]] of fixed air in nitre, or the [[power]] of steam, or of
electricity, or of magnetism. these energies always existed in [[nature]],
and they were always discernible. they seemed, some of them
unserviceable, some noxious, some no [[better]] than a [[sport]] to
children,--until contemplative ability, combining with practic [[skill]],
tamed their wild [[nature]], subdued them to use, and rendered them at once
the most powerful and the most tractable agents, in subservience to the
great views and designs of [[men]]. did fifty thousand persons [[person]], whose mental
and whose bodily labor you might direct, and so many hundred thousand a
year of a [[revenue]], which was neither lazy nor [[superstitious]], appear too
big for your abilities to wield? had you no way of using the [[men]], but by
converting monks into pensioners? had you no way of turning the revenue
to account, but through the improvident resource of a spendthrift sale?
if you were thus destitute of mental funds, the proceeding is in its
natural course. your politicians do not [[understand]] their [[trade]]; and
therefore they sell their tools.

but the [[institutions]] savor of superstition in their very [[principle]]; and
they nourish it by a permanent and standing influence.--this i do not
mean to dispute; but this ought not to hinder you from deriving from
superstition itself any resources which may thence be furnished for the
public advantage. you derive benefits from many dispositions and many
passions of the [[human]] [[mind]] which are of as doubtful a color, in the
moral eye, as superstition itself. it was your [[business]] to [[correct]] and
mitigate everything which was noxious in this passion, as in all the
passions. but is superstition the [[greatest]] of all possible vices [[vice]]? in its
possible excess i [[think]] it becomes a very [[great]] [[evil]]. it is, however, a
moral [[subject]], and of course admits of all degrees [[degree]] and all
modifications. superstition is the [[religion]] of feeble minds [[mind]]; and they
must be tolerated in an intermixture of it, in some trifling or some
enthusiastic shape or other, else you will deprive [[weak]] minds [[mind]] of a
resource found necessary to the strongest. the [[body]] of all true religion
consists, to be sure, in [[obedience]] to the will of the [[sovereign]] of the
world, in a confidence in his declarations, and in imitation of his
perfections. the rest is our own. it may be prejudicial to the great
end,--it may be auxiliary. [[wise]] [[men]], who, as such, are not _admirers_,
(not admirers at least of the _munera terræ_,) are not violently
attached to these things, nor do they violently hate them. [[wisdom]] is not
the most severe corrector of folly. they are the rival follies which
mutually wage so unrelenting a [[war]], and which make so cruel a use of
their advantages, as they can happen to engage the immoderate vulgar, on
the one side or the other, in their quarrels. prudence would be neuter;
but if, in the contention between fond attachment and fierce antipathy
concerning things in their [[nature]] not made to [[produce]] such heats, a
prudent [[man]] were obliged to make a [[choice]] of what errors and excesses of
enthusiasm he would condemn or bear, perhaps he would [[think]] the
superstition which builds to be more tolerable than that which
demolishes,--that which adorns a [[country]], than that which deforms
it,--that which endows, than that which plunders,--that which disposes
to mistaken beneficence, than that which stimulates to real
injustice,--that which leads a [[man]] to refuse to himself lawful
pleasures, than that which snatches from others the scanty subsistence
of their self-denial. such, i [[think]], is very nearly the [[state]] of the
question between the ancient founders of monkish superstition and the
superstition of the pretended [[philosophers]] of the hour.

for the [[present]] i postpone all consideration of the supposed public
profit of the sale, which, however, i conceive to be perfectly delusive.
i shall here only consider it as a transfer of [[property]]. on the policy
of that transfer i shall trouble you with a few thoughts [[thought]].

in every prosperous [[community]] something more is produced than goes to
the immediate support of the producer. this surplus forms the income of
the landed capitalist. it will be spent by a proprietor who does not
labor. but this idleness is itself the spring of labor, this repose the
spur to industry. the only concern for the [[state]] is, that the capital
taken in rent from the [[land]] should be returned again to the industry
from whence it came, and that its expenditure should be with the least
possible detriment to the morals [[moral]] of those who expend it and to those of
the [[people]] to whom it is returned.

in all the views of receipt, expenditure, and personal employment, a
sober legislator would carefully compare the possessor whom he was
recommended to expel with the stranger who was proposed to fill his
place. before the inconveniences are incurred which _must_ attend all
violent revolutions [[revolution]] in [[property]] through extensive confiscation, we ought
to have some [[rational]] assurance that the purchasers of the confiscated
property will be in a considerable [[degree]] more laborious, more [[virtuous]],
more sober, less disposed to extort an unreasonable proportion of the
gains of the laborer, or to consume on themselves a larger share than is
fit for the measure of an [[individual]],--or that they should be qualified
to dispense the surplus in a more steady and [[equal]] mode, so as to
answer the purposes [[purpose]] of a [[politic]] expenditure, than the old possessors,
call those possessors bishops, or canons, or commendatory abbots, or
monks, or what you please. the monks are lazy. be it so. suppose them no
otherwise employed than by singing in the choir. they are as usefully
employed as those who neither sing nor say,--as usefully even as those
who sing upon the stage. they are as usefully employed as if they worked
from dawn to dark in the innumerable servile, degrading, unseemly,
unmanly, and often most unwholesome and pestiferous occupations to which
by the social economy so many wretches are inevitably doomed. if it were
not generally pernicious to disturb the [[natural]] course of things, and to
impede in any [[degree]] the [[great]] wheel of circulation which is turned by
the strangely directed labor of these unhappy [[people]], i should be
infinitely more inclined forcibly to rescue them from their miserable
industry than violently to disturb the tranquil repose of monastic
quietude. [[humanity]], and perhaps policy, might [[better]] justify me in the
one than in the other. it is a [[subject]] on which i have often reflected,
and never reflected without feeling from it. i am sure that no
consideration, except the necessity of submitting to the yoke of luxury
and the despotism of fancy, who in their own imperious way will
distribute the surplus product of the soil, can justify the toleration
of such trades [[trade]] and employments in a well-regulated [[state]]. but for this
purpose of distribution, it seems to me that the idle expenses of monks
are quite as well directed as the idle expenses of us lay loiterers.

when the advantages of the possession and of the project are on a par,
there is no motive for a [[change]]. but in the [[present]] case, perhaps, they
are not upon a par, and the difference is in favor of the possession. it
does not appear to me that the expenses of those whom you are going to
expel do in [[fact]] take a course so directly and so generally leading to
vitiate and degrade and render miserable those through whom they pass as
the expenses of those favorites whom you are intruding into their
houses. why should the expenditure of a [[great]] landed [[property]], which is
a dispersion of the surplus product of the soil, appear intolerable to
you or to me, when it takes its course through the accumulation of vast
libraries, which are the [[history]] of the [[force]] and weakness of the human
mind,--through [[great]] collections of ancient records, medals, and coins,
which attest and explain laws [[law]] and customs,--through paintings and
statues, that, by imitating [[nature]], seem to extend the limits of
creation,--through grand monuments of the [[dead]], which continue the
regards and connections of [[life]] beyond the grave,--through collections
of the specimens of [[nature]], which become a representative assembly of
all the classes and families [[family]] of the [[world]], that by disposition
facilitate, and by exciting curiosity open, the avenues to [[science]]? if
by [[great]] permanent establishments all these objects of expense are
better secured from the inconstant [[sport]] of personal caprice and
personal extravagance, are they worse than if the same tastes prevailed
in scattered individuals [[individual]]? does not the sweat of the mason and carpenter,
who toil in order to partake the sweat of the peasant, flow as
pleasantly and as salubriously in the construction and repair of the
majestic edifices of [[religion]] as in the painted booths and sordid sties
of [[vice]] and luxury? as honorably and as profitably in repairing those
sacred works [[work]] which grow hoary with innumerable years as on the momentary
receptacles of transient voluptuousness,--in opera-houses, and brothels,
and gaming-houses, and club-houses, and obelisks in the champ de [[mars]]?
is the surplus product of the olive and the vine worse employed in the
frugal sustenance of persons [[person]] whom the fictions of a pious imagination
raise to [[dignity]] by construing in the service of [[god]] than in pampering
the innumerable multitude of those who are degraded by being made
useless domestics, subservient to the [[pride]] of [[man]]? are the decorations
of temples an expenditure less worthy a [[wise]] [[man]] than ribbons, and
laces, and national cockades, and petit maisons, and petit soupers, and
all the innumerable fopperies and follies in which opulence sports [[sport]] away
the burden of its superfluity?

we tolerate even these,--not from [[love]] of them, but for [[fear]] of worse.
we tolerate them, because [[property]] and [[liberty]], to a [[degree]], require
that toleration. but why proscribe the other, and surely, in every point
of view, the more laudable use of estates? why, through the violation of
all [[property]], through an outrage upon every [[principle]] of [[liberty]],
forcibly carry them from the [[better]] to the worse?

this comparison between the new individuals [[individual]] and the old corps is made
upon a supposition that no reform could be made in the latter. but, in a
question of reformation, i always consider corporate bodies [[body]], whether
sole or consisting of many, to be much more susceptible of a public
direction, by the [[power]] of the [[state]], in the use of their [[property]], and
in the regulation of modes and habits of [[life]] in their members, than
private [[citizens]] ever can be, or perhaps ought to be; and this seems to
me a very material consideration for those who undertake anything which
merits the name of a [[politic]] enterprise.--so far as to the estates of
monasteries.

with regard to the estates possessed by bishops and canons and
commendatory abbots, i cannot find out for what [[reason]] some landed
estates may not be held otherwise than by [[inheritance]]. can any
philosophic spoiler undertake to demonstrate the positive or the
comparative [[evil]] of having a [[certain]], and that, too, a large, portion of
landed [[property]] passing in succession through persons [[person]] whose title to it
is, always in theory and often in [[fact]], an eminent [[degree]] of piety,
morals, and learning; a [[property]] which by its destination, in their
turn, and on the score of [[merit]], gives to the noblest families
renovation and support, to the lowest the means of [[dignity]] and
elevation; a [[property]], the tenure of which is the performance of some
duty, (whatever value you may choose to set upon that [[duty]],) and the
character of whose proprietors demands at least an exterior decorum and
gravity of manners,--who are to exercise a generous, but temperate
hospitality,--part of whose income they are to consider as a trust for
charity,--and who, even when they fail in their trust, when they slide
from their [[character]], and degenerate into a mere [[common]] secular nobleman
or gentleman, are in no [[respect]] worse than those who may succeed them in
their forfeited possessions? is it [[better]] that estates should be held by
those who have no [[duty]] than by those who have one? by those whose
character and destination point to virtues [[virtue]] than by those who have no
rule and direction in the expenditure of their estates but their own
will and appetite? nor are these estates held altogether in the
character or with the evils [[evil]] supposed inherent in mortmain. they pass
from hand to hand with a more rapid circulation than any other. no
excess is [[good]], and therefore too [[great]] a proportion of landed property
may be held officially for [[life]]; but it does not seem to me of material
injury to any [[common]] [[wealth]] that there should [[exist]] some estates that
have a [[chance]] of being acquired by other means than the previous
acquisition of [[money]].

       *       *       *       *       *

this letter is grown to a [[great]] length, though it is, indeed, short with
regard to the infinite extent of the [[subject]]. various avocations have
from [[time]] to [[time]] called my [[mind]] from the [[subject]]. i was not [[sorry]] to
give myself leisure to observe whether in the proceedings of the
national assembly i might not find reasons [[reason]] to [[change]] or to qualify some
of my first sentiments. everything has confirmed me more strongly in my
first opinions [[opinion]]. it was my original [[purpose]] to take a view of the
principles of the national assembly with regard to the [[great]] and
fundamental establishments, and to compare the whole of what you have
substituted in the place of what you have destroyed with the several
members of our british [[constitution]]. but this plan is of greater extent
than at first i computed, and i find that you have little [[desire]] to take
the advantage of any examples [[example]]. at [[present]] i must content myself with
some remarks upon your establishments, reserving for another [[time]] what i
proposed to say concerning the spirit of our british [[monarchy]],
aristocracy, and [[democracy]], as practically they [[exist]].

i have taken a view of what has been done by the governing [[power]] in
france. i have certainly spoke of it with [[freedom]]. those whose principle
it is to despise the ancient, permanent sense of [[mankind]], and to set up
a scheme of [[society]] on new principles [[principle]], must naturally expect that such
of us who [[think]] [[better]] of the [[judgment]] of the [[human]] [[race]] than, of theirs
should consider both them and their devices as [[men]] and schemes upon
their [[trial]]. they must take it for granted that we attend much to their
reason, but not at all to their [[authority]]. they have not one of the
great influencing prejudices of [[mankind]] in their favor. they avow their
hostility to [[opinion]]. of course they must expect no support from that
influence, which, with every other [[authority]], they have deposed from the
seat of its jurisdiction.

i can never consider this assembly as anything else than a voluntary
association of [[men]] who have availed themselves of circumstances to seize
upon the [[power]] of the [[state]]. they have not the sanction and [[authority]] of
the [[character]] under which they first met. they have assumed another of a
very different [[nature]], and have completely altered and inverted all the
relations in which they originally stood. they do not hold the authority
they exercise under any constitutional [[law]] of the [[state]]. they have
departed from the instructions of the [[people]] by whom they were sent;
which instructions, as the assembly did not act in [[virtue]] of any ancient
usage or settled [[law]], were the sole source of their [[authority]]. the most
considerable of their acts have not been done by [[great]] majorities; and
in this sort of near divisions, which carry only the constructive
authority of the whole, strangers will consider reasons [[reason]] as well as
resolutions.

if they had set up this new, experimental [[government]] as a necessary
substitute for an expelled [[tyranny]], [[mankind]] would anticipate the [[time]] of
prescription, which through long usage mellows into legality governments
that were [[violent]] in their commencement. all those who have affections
which lead them to the conservation of civil order would recognize, even
in its cradle, the child as legitimate, which has been produced from
those principles [[principle]] of cogent expediency to which all just governments [[government]] owe
their birth, and on which they justify their continuance. but they will
be late and reluctant in giving any sort of countenance to the
operations of a [[power]] which has derived its birth from no [[law]] and no
necessity, but which, on the contrary, has had its origin in those vices
and sinister practices by which the social union is often disturbed and
sometimes destroyed. this assembly has hardly a year's prescription. we
have their own word for it that they have made a [[revolution]]. to make a
revolution is a measure which, _primâ fronte_, requires an apology. to
make a [[revolution]] is to subvert the ancient [[state]] of our [[country]]; and no
common reasons [[reason]] are called for to justify so [[violent]] a proceeding. the
sense of [[mankind]] authorizes us to examine into the mode of acquiring new
power, and to criticize on the use that is made of it, with less awe and
reverence than that which is usually conceded to a settled and
recognized [[authority]].

in obtaining and securing their [[power]], the assembly proceeds upon
principles the most opposite from those which appear to direct them in
the use of it. an observation on this difference will let us into the
true spirit of their conduct. everything which they have done, or
continue to do, in order to obtain and keep their [[power]], is by the most
common [[arts]]. they proceed exactly as their [[ancestors]] of [[ambition]] have
done before them. trace them through all their artifices, frauds, and
violences, you can find nothing at all that is new. they follow
precedents and examples [[example]] with the punctilious exactness of a pleader.
they never depart an iota from the authentic formulas of [[tyranny]] and
usurpation. but in all the regulations relative to the [[public]] [[good]] the
spirit has been the very reverse of this. there they commit the whole to
the [[mercy]] of untried speculations; they abandon the dearest interests of
the [[public]] to those loose theories to which none of them would choose to
trust the slightest of his private concerns. they make this difference,
because in their [[desire]] of obtaining and securing [[power]] they are
thoroughly in earnest; there they travel in the beaten road. the public
interests, because about them they have no real solicitude, they abandon
wholly to [[chance]]: i say to [[chance]], because their schemes have nothing in
experience to prove their tendency beneficial.

we must always see with a [[pity]] not unmixed with [[respect]] the errors of
those who are timid and doubtful of themselves with regard to points
wherein the [[happiness]] of [[mankind]] is concerned. but in these gentlemen
there is nothing of the tender parental solicitude which fears [[fear]] to cut up
the infant for the sake of an experiment. in the vastness of their
promises and the confidence of their predictions they far outdo all the
boasting of empirics. the arrogance of their pretensions in a manner
provokes and challenges us to an inquiry into their foundation.

i am convinced that there are [[men]] of considerable parts among the
popular leaders in the national assembly. some of them display eloquence
in their speeches [[speech]] and their writings. this cannot be without powerful
and cultivated [[talents]]. but eloquence may [[exist]] without a proportionable
degree of [[wisdom]]. when i speak of ability, i am obliged to distinguish.
what they have done towards the support of their [[system]] bespeaks no
ordinary [[men]]. in the [[system]] itself, taken as the scheme of a republic
constructed for procuring the [[prosperity]] and security of the citizen,
and for promoting the [[strength]] and grandeur of the [[state]], i confess
myself unable to find out anything which displays, in a [[single]] instance,
the [[work]] of a comprehensive and disposing [[mind]], or even the provisions
of a vulgar prudence. their [[purpose]] everywhere seems to have been to
evade and slip aside from _difficulty_. this it has been the [[glory]] of
the [[great]] masters in all the [[arts]] to confront, and to overcome,--and
when they had overcome the first difficulty, to turn it into an
instrument for new conquests over new difficulties: thus to enable them
to extend the [[empire]] of their [[science]], and even to push forward, beyond
the reach of their original thoughts [[thought]], the landmarks of the human
understanding itself. difficulty is a severe instructor, set over us by
the supreme ordinance of a parental guardian and legislator, who knows
us [[better]] than we [[know]] ourselves, as he loves [[love]] us [[better]] too. _pater ipse
colendi haud facilem esse viam voluit_. he that wrestles with us
strengthens our nerves and sharpens our [[skill]]. our antagonist is our
helper. this amicable conflict with difficulty obliges us to an intimate
acquaintance with our object, and compels us to consider it in all its
relations. it will not suffer us to be superficial. it is the want of
nerves of understanding for such a task, it is the degenerate fondness
for tricking short-outs and little fallacious facilities, that has in so
many parts of the [[world]] created governments [[government]] with arbitrary powers [[power]]. they
have created the late arbitrary [[monarchy]] of [[france]]. they have created
the arbitrary [[republic]] of [[paris]]. with them defects in [[wisdom]] are to be
supplied by the plenitude of [[force]]. they get nothing by it. commencing
their labors on a [[principle]] of sloth, they have the [[common]] [[fortune]] of
slothful [[men]]. the difficulties, which they rather had eluded than
escaped, meet them again in their course; they multiply and thicken on
them; they are involved, through a labyrinth of confused detail, in an
industry without limit and without direction; and in conclusion, the
whole of their [[work]] becomes feeble, vicious, and insecure.

it is this inability to wrestle with difficulty which has obliged the
arbitrary assembly of [[france]] to commence their schemes of reform with
abolition and total destruction.[120] but is it in destroying and
pulling down that [[skill]] is displayed? your mob can do this as well at
least as your assemblies. the shallowest understanding, the rudest hand,
is more than [[equal]] to that task. rage and frenzy will pull down more in
half an hour than prudence, deliberation, and foresight can build up in
a hundred years. the errors and defects of old establishments are
visible and palpable. it calls for little ability to point them out; and
where absolute [[power]] is given, it requires but a word wholly to abolish
the [[vice]] and the establishment together. the same lazy, but restless
disposition, which loves [[love]] sloth and hates quiet, directs these
politicians, when they come to [[work]] for supplying the place of what they
have destroyed. to make everything the reverse of what they have seen is
quite as easy as to [[destroy]]. no difficulties occur in what has never
been tried. criticism is almost baffled in discovering the defects of
what has not existed; and eager enthusiasm and cheating [[hope]] have all
the wide field of [[imagination]], in which they may expatiate with little
or no opposition.

at once to preserve and to reform is quite another thing. when the
useful parts of an old establishment are kept, and what is superadded is
to be fitted to what is retained, a vigorous [[mind]], steady, persevering
attention, various powers [[power]] of comparison and combination, and the
resources of an understanding fruitful in expedients are to be
exercised; they are to be exercised in a continued conflict with the
combined [[force]] of opposite vices [[vice]], with the obstinacy that rejects all
improvement, and the levity that is fatigued and disgusted with
everything of which it is in possession. but you may object,--"a process
of this [[kind]] is slow. it is not fit for an assembly which glories in
performing in a few months the [[work]] of ages [[age]]. such a mode of reforming,
possibly, might take up many years." without [[question]] it might; and it
ought. it is one of the excellences of a method in which [[time]] is amongst
the assistants, that its operation is slow, and in some cases almost
imperceptible. if circumspection and caution are a part of [[wisdom]], when
we [[work]] only upon inanimate matter, surely they become a part of duty
too, when the [[subject]] of our demolition and construction is not brick
and timber, but sentient beings, by the sudden alteration of whose
state, condition, and habits, multitudes may be rendered miserable. but
it seems as if it were the prevalent [[opinion]] in [[paris]], that an unfeeling
heart and an undoubting confidence are the sole qualifications for a
perfect legislator. far different are my ideas [[idea]] of that high office. the
true lawgiver ought to have a [[heart]] full of sensibility. he ought to
love and [[respect]] his [[kind]], and to [[fear]] himself. it may be allowed to his
temperament to catch his ultimate object with an intuitive glance; but
his movements towards it ought to be deliberate. [[political]] arrangement,
as it is a [[work]] for social ends, is to be only wrought by social means.
there [[mind]] must conspire with [[mind]]. [[time]] is required to [[produce]] that
union of minds [[mind]] which alone can [[produce]] all the [[good]] we aim at. our
patience will achieve more than our [[force]]. if i might venture to appeal
to what is so much out of [[fashion]] in [[paris]],--i mean to [[experience]],--i
should tell you, that in my course i have known, and, according to my
measure, have coöperated with [[great]] [[men]]; and i have never yet seen any
plan which has not been mended by the observations of those who were
much inferior in understanding to the [[person]] who took the lead in the
business. by a slow, but well-sustained [[progress]], the effect of each
step is watched; the [[good]] or ill [[success]] of the first gives [[light]] to us
in the second; and so, from [[light]] to [[light]], we are conducted with safety
through the whole series. we see that the parts of the [[system]] do not
clash. the evils [[evil]] latent in the most promising contrivances are provided
for as they arise. one advantage is as little as possible sacrificed to
another. we compensate, we reconcile, we balance. we are enabled to
unite into a consistent whole the various anomalies and contending
principles that are found in the minds [[mind]] and affairs of [[men]]. from hence
arises, not an excellence in simplicity, but one far superior, an
excellence in composition. where the [[great]] interests of [[mankind]] are
concerned through a long succession of generations [[generation]], that succession
ought to be admitted into some share in the councils which are so deeply
to affect them. if [[justice]] requires this, the [[work]] itself requires the
aid of more minds [[mind]] than one [[age]] can furnish. it is from this view of
things that the [[best]] legislators have been often satisfied with the
establishment of some sure, solid, and ruling [[principle]] in
government,--a [[power]] like that which some of the [[philosophers]] have
called a plastic [[nature]]; and having fixed the [[principle]], they have left
it afterwards to its own operation.

to proceed in this manner, that is, to proceed with a presiding
principle and a prolific energy, is with me the criterion of profound
wisdom. what your politicians [[think]] the marks of a bold, hardy genius
are only proofs of a deplorable want of ability. by their [[violent]] haste,
and their defiance of the process of [[nature]], they are delivered over
blindly to every projector and adventurer, to every alchemist and
empiric. they despair of turning to account anything that is [[common]].
diet is nothing in their [[system]] of remedy. the worst of it is, that this
their despair of curing [[common]] distempers by regular methods arises not
only from defect of comprehension, but, i [[fear]], from some malignity of
disposition. your legislators seem to have taken their opinions [[opinion]] of all
professions, ranks, and offices from the declamations and buffooneries
of satirists,--who would themselves be astonished, if they were held to
the letter of their own descriptions. by listening only to these, your
leaders regard all things only on the side of their vices [[vice]] and faults [[fault]],
and view those vices [[vice]] and faults [[fault]] under every color of exaggeration. it is
undoubtedly true, though it may seem paradoxical,--but, in general,
those who are habitually employed in finding and displaying faults [[fault]] are
unqualified for the [[work]] of reformation; because their minds [[mind]] are not
only unfurnished with patterns of the [[fair]] and [[good]], but by habit they
come to take no delight in the contemplation of those things. by hating
vices too much, they come to [[love]] [[men]] too little. it is therefore not
wonderful that they should be indisposed and unable to serve them. from
hence arises the complexional disposition of some of your guides to pull
everything in pieces. at this malicious game they display the whole of
their _quadrimanous_ activity. as to the rest, the paradoxes of eloquent
writers, brought forth purely as a [[sport]] of fancy, to try their [[talents]],
to rouse attention, and excite surprise, are taken up by these
gentlemen, not in the spirit of the original authors, as means of
cultivating their taste and improving their style: these paradoxes
become with them serious grounds of action, upon which they proceed in
regulating the most important concerns of the [[state]]. cicero ludicrously
describes cato as endeavoring to act in the commonwealth upon the school
paradoxes which exercised the wits of the junior students in the stoic
philosophy. if this was true of cato, these gentlemen copy after him in
the manner of some persons [[person]] who lived about his [[time]],--_pede nudo
catonem_. mr. hume told me that he had from [[rousseau]] himself the secret
of his principles [[principle]] of composition. that acute, though eccentric observer,
had perceived, that, to strike and interest the [[public]], the marvellous
must be produced; that the marvellous of the heathen mythology had long
since lost its effects; that giants, magicians, fairies, and heroes of
romance, which succeeded, had exhausted the portion of credulity which
belonged to their [[age]]; that now nothing was left to a writer but that
species of the marvellous, which might still be produced, and with as
great an effect as ever, though in another way,--that is, the marvellous
in [[life]], in manners, in characters [[character]], and in extraordinary situations,
giving rise to new and unlooked-for strokes in [[politics]] and morals [[moral]]. i
believe, that, were [[rousseau]] alive, and in one of his lucid intervals,
he would be shocked at the practical frenzy of his scholars, who in
their paradoxes are servile imitators, and even in their incredulity
discover an implicit [[faith]].

men who undertake considerable things, even in a regular way, ought to
give us ground to presume ability. but the physician of the [[state]], who,
not satisfied with the cure of distempers, undertakes to regenerate
constitutions, ought to show uncommon powers [[power]]. some very unusual
appearances of [[wisdom]] ought to display themselves on the face of the
designs of those who appeal to no practice and who copy after no model.
has any such been manifested? i shall take a view (it shall for the
subject be a very short one) of what the assembly has done, with regard,
first, to the [[constitution]] of the legislature; in the next place, to
that of the executive [[power]]; then to that of the judicature; afterwards
to the model of the [[army]]; and conclude with the [[system]] of finance: to
see whether we can discover in any part of their schemes the portentous
ability which may justify these bold undertakers in the superiority
which they assume over [[mankind]].

it is in the model of the [[sovereign]] and presiding part of this new
republic that we should expect their grand display. here they were to
prove their title to their proud demands. for the plan itself at large,
and for the reasons [[reason]] on which it is grounded, i refer to the journals of
the assembly of the 29th of september, 1789, and to the subsequent
proceedings which have made any alterations in the plan. so far as in a
matter somewhat confused i can see [[light]], the [[system]] remains
substantially as it has been originally framed. my few remarks will be
such as regard its spirit, its tendency, and its fitness for framing a
popular commonwealth, which they profess theirs to be, suited to the
ends for which any commonwealth, and particularly such a commonwealth,
is made. at the same [[time]] i mean to consider its consistency with itself
and its own principles [[principle]].

old establishments are tried by their effects. if the [[people]] are [[happy]],
united, wealthy, and powerful, we presume the rest. we conclude that to
be [[good]] from whence [[good]] is derived. in old establishments various
correctives have been found for their aberrations from theory. indeed,
they are the results of various necessities and expediences. they are
not often constructed after any theory: theories are rather drawn from
them. in them we often see the end [[best]] obtained, where the means seem
not perfectly reconcilable to what we may fancy was the original scheme.
the means taught by [[experience]] may be [[better]] suited to [[political]] ends
than those contrived in the original project. they again react upon the
primitive [[constitution]], and sometimes improve the design itself, from
which they seem to have departed. i [[think]] all this might be curiously
exemplified in the british [[constitution]]. at worst, the errors and
deviations of every [[kind]] in reckoning are found and computed, and the
ship proceeds in her course. this is the case of old establishments; but
in a new and merely theoretic [[system]], it is expected that every
contrivance shall appear, on the face of it, to [[answer]] its ends,
especially where the projectors are no way embarrassed with an endeavor
to accommodate the new building to an old one, either in the walls or on
the foundations.

the french builders, clearing away as mere rubbish whatever they found,
and, like their ornamental gardeners, forming everything into an exact
level, propose to rest the whole local and general legislature on three
bases of three different kinds [[kind]],--one geometrical, one arithmetical, and
the third financial; the first of which they call _the basis of
territory_; the second, _the basis of population_; and the third, _the
basis of contribution_. for the accomplishment of the first of these
purposes, they divide the area of their [[country]] into eighty-three
pieces, regularly square, of eighteen leagues by eighteen. these large
divisions are called _departments_. these they portion, proceeding by
square measurement, into seventeen hundred and twenty districts, called
_communes_. these again they subdivide, still proceeding by square
measurement, into smaller districts, called _cantons_, making in all
6,400.

at first view this geometrical basis of theirs presents [[present]] not much to
admire or to blame. it calls for no [[great]] legislative [[talents]]. nothing
more than an accurate land-surveyor, with his chain, sight, and
theodolite, is requisite for such a plan as this. in the old divisions
of the [[country]], various accidents at times [[time]], and the ebb and flow of
various properties [[property]] and jurisdictions, settled their bounds. these bounds
were not made upon any fixed [[system]], undoubtedly. they were [[subject]] to
some inconveniences; but they were inconveniences for which use had
found remedies, and habit had supplied accommodation and patience. in
this new pavement of square within square, and this organization and
semi-organization, made on the [[system]] of empedocles and buffon, and not
upon any [[politic]] [[principle]], it is impossible that innumerable local
inconveniences, to which [[men]] are not habituated, must not arise. but
these i pass over, because it requires an accurate [[knowledge]] of the
country, which i do not possess, to specify them.

when these [[state]] surveyors came to take a view of their [[work]] of
measurement, they soon found that in [[politics]] the most fallacious of all
things was geometrical demonstration. they had then recourse to another
basis (or rather buttress) to support the building, which tottered on
that false foundation. it was evident that the goodness of the soil, the
number of the [[people]], their [[wealth]], and the largeness of their
contribution, made such infinite variations between square and square
as to render mensuration a ridiculous standard of [[power]] in the
commonwealth, and equality in geometry the most unequal of all measures
in the distribution of [[men]]. however, they could not give it up,--but,
dividing their [[political]] and civil representation into three parts, they
allotted one of those parts to the square measurement, without a single
fact or calculation to ascertain whether this territorial proportion of
representation was fairly assigned, and ought upon any [[principle]] really
to be a third. having, however, given to geometry this portion, (of a
third for her dower,) out of compliment, i suppose, to that sublime
science, they left the other two to be scuffled for between the other
parts, [[population]] and contribution.

when they came to provide for [[population]], they were not able to proceed
quite so smoothly as they had done in the field of their geometry. here
their arithmetic came to bear upon their juridical metaphysics. had they
stuck to their metaphysic principles [[principle]], the arithmetical process would be
simple indeed. [[men]], with them, are strictly [[equal]], and are entitled to
equal rights [[right]] in their own [[government]]. each head, on this [[system]], would
have its vote, and every [[man]] would vote directly for the [[person]] who was
to represent him in the legislature. "but soft,--by regular degrees [[degree]], not
yet." this metaphysic [[principle]], to which [[law]], custom, usage, policy,
reason, were to yield, is to yield itself to their [[pleasure]]. there must
be many degrees [[degree]], and some stages, before the representative can come in
contact with his constituent. indeed, as we shall soon see, these two
persons are to have no sort of communion with each other. first, the
voters in the _canton_, who compose what they call _primary
assemblies_, are to have a _qualification_. what! a qualification on the
indefeasible rights [[right]] of [[men]]? yes; but it shall be a very small
qualification. our [[injustice]] shall be very little oppressive: only the
local valuation of three days' labor paid to the [[public]]. why, this is
not much, i readily admit, for anything but the utter subversion of your
equalizing [[principle]]. as a qualification it might as well be let alone;
for it answers [[answer]] no one [[purpose]] for which qualifications are established;
and, on your ideas [[idea]], it excludes from a vote the [[man]] of all others whose
natural equality stands the most in need of protection and defence: i
mean the [[man]] who has nothing else but his [[natural]] equality to guard him.
you order him to buy the [[right]] which you before told him [[nature]] had
given to him gratuitously at his birth, and of which no [[authority]] on
earth could lawfully deprive him. with regard to the [[person]] who cannot
come up to your market, a tyrannous [[aristocracy]], as against him, is
established at the very outset, by you who pretend to be its sworn foe.

the gradation proceeds. these primary assemblies of the _canton_ elect
deputies to the _commune_,--one for every two hundred qualified
inhabitants. here is the first medium put between the primary elector
and the representative legislator; and here a new turnpike is fixed for
taxing the rights [[right]] of [[men]] with a second qualification: for none can be
elected into the _commune_ who does not [[pay]] the amount of ten days'
labor. nor have we yet done. there is still to be another
gradation.[121] these _communes_, chosen by the _canton_, choose to the
_department_; and the deputies of the _department_ choose their deputies
to the _national assembly_. here is a third barrier of a senseless
qualification. every deputy to the national assembly must [[pay]], in direct
contribution, to the value of a _mark of silver_. of all these
qualifying barriers we must [[think]] alike: that they are impotent to
secure independence, [[strong]] only to [[destroy]] the rights [[right]] of [[men]].

in all this process, which in its fundamental elements affects to
consider only _population_, upon a [[principle]] of [[natural]] [[right]], there is
a manifest attention to _property_,--which, however just and reasonable
on other schemes, is on theirs perfectly unsupportable.

when they come to their third basis, that of _contribution_, we find
that they have more completely lost sight of the rights [[right]] of [[men]]. this
last basis rests _entirely_ on [[property]]. a [[principle]] totally different
from the equality of [[men]], and utterly irreconcilable to it, is thereby
admitted: but no sooner is this [[principle]] admitted than (as usual) it is
subverted; and it is not subverted (as we shall presently see) to
approximate the inequality of riches [[rich]] to the level of [[nature]]. the
additional share in the third portion of representation (a portion
reserved exclusively for the higher contribution) is made to regard the
_district_ only, and not the individuals [[individual]] in it who [[pay]]. it is easy to
perceive, by the course of their reasonings, how much they were
embarrassed by their contradictory ideas [[idea]] of the rights [[right]] of [[men]] and the
privileges of riches [[rich]]. the committee of [[constitution]] do as [[good]] as admit
that they are wholly irreconcilable. "the relation with regard to the
contributions is without [[doubt]] _null_, (say they,) when the [[question]] is
on the balance of the [[political]] rights [[right]] as between [[individual]] and
individual; without which _personal equality would be destroyed_, and
_an [[aristocracy]] of the rich_ would be established. but this
inconvenience entirely disappears, when the proportional relation of the
contribution is only considered in the _great masses_, and is solely
between province and province; it serves in that case only to form a
just reciprocal proportion between the cities [[city]], without affecting the
personal rights [[right]] of the [[citizens]]."

here the [[principle]] of _contribution_, as taken between [[man]] and [[man]], is
reprobated as _null_, and destructive to equality,--and as pernicious,
too, because it leads to the establishment of an _aristocracy of the
rich_. however, it must not be abandoned. and the way of getting rid of
the difficulty is to establish the inequality as between department and
department, leaving all the individuals [[individual]] in each department upon an exact
par. observe, that this parity between individuals [[individual]] had been before
destroyed, when the qualifications within the departments were settled;
nor does it seem a matter of [[great]] importance whether the equality of
men be injured by masses or individually. an [[individual]] is not of the
same importance in a mass represented by a few as in a mass represented
by many. it would be too much to tell a [[man]] [[jealous]] of his equality,
that the elector has the same franchise who votes for three members as
he who votes for ten.

now take it in the other point of view, and let us suppose their
principle of representation according to contribution, that is according
to riches [[rich]], to be well imagined, and to be a necessary basis for their
republic. in this their third basis they assume that riches [[rich]] ought to be
respected, and that [[justice]] and policy require that they should entitle
men, in some mode or other, to a larger share in the administration of
public affairs; it is now to be seen how the assembly provides for the
preëminence, or even for the security of the [[rich]], by conferring, in
virtue of their opulence, that larger measure of [[power]] to their district
which is denied to them personally. i readily admit (indeed, i should
lay it down as a fundamental principle) that in a republican [[government]],
which has a democratic basis, the [[rich]] do require an additional security
above what is necessary to them in monarchies [[monarchy]]. they are [[subject]] to envy,
and through envy to oppression. on the [[present]] scheme it is impossible
to [[divine]] what advantage they derive from the aristocratic preference
upon which the unequal representation of the masses is founded. the rich
cannot [[feel]] it, either as a support to [[dignity]] or as security to
fortune: for the aristocratic mass is generated from purely democratic
principles; and the prevalence given to it in the general representation
has no sort of reference to or connection with the persons [[person]] upon account
of whose [[property]] this superiority of the mass is established. if the
contrivers of this scheme meant any sort of favor to the [[rich]], in
consequence of their contribution, they ought to have conferred the
privilege either on the [[individual]] [[rich]], or on some class formed of rich
persons (as historians represent servius tullius to have done in the
early [[constitution]] of rome); because the contest between the [[rich]] and
the [[poor]] is not a struggle between corporation and corporation, but a
contest between [[men]] and [[men]],--a competition, not between districts, but
between descriptions. it would [[answer]] its [[purpose]] [[better]], if the scheme
were inverted: that the votes of the masses were rendered [[equal]], and
that the votes within each mass were proportioned to [[property]].

let us suppose one [[man]] in a district (it is an easy supposition) to
contribute as much as a hundred of his neighbors. against these he has
but one vote. if there were but one representative for the mass, his
poor neighbors would outvote him by an hundred to one for that single
representative. [[bad]] enough! but amends are to be made him. how? the
district, in [[virtue]] of his [[wealth]], is to choose, say ten members instead
of one: that is to say, by paying a very large contribution he has the
happiness of being outvoted, an hundred to one, by the [[poor]], for ten
representatives, instead of being outvoted exactly in the same
proportion for a [[single]] member. in [[truth]], instead of benefiting by this
superior quantity of representation, the [[rich]] [[man]] is subjected to an
additional hardship. the increase of representation within his province
sets up nine persons [[person]] more, and as many more than nine as there may be
democratic candidates, to cabal and intrigue and to flatter the people
at his expense and to his oppression. an interest is by this means held
out to multitudes of the inferior sort, in obtaining a salary of
eighteen livres a day, (to them a vast object,) besides the [[pleasure]] of
a residence in [[paris]], and their share in the [[government]] of the [[kingdom]].
the more the objects of [[ambition]] are multiplied and become democratic,
just in that proportion the [[rich]] are endangered.

thus it must fare between the [[poor]] and the [[rich]] in the province deemed
aristocratic, which in its internal relation is the very reverse of that
character. in its external relation, that is, in its relation to the
other provinces, i cannot see how the unequal representation which is
given to masses on account of [[wealth]] becomes the means of preserving the
equipoise and the tranquillity of the commonwealth. for, if it be one of
the objects to secure the [[weak]] from being crushed by the [[strong]], (as in
all [[society]] undoubtedly it is,) how are the smaller and poorer of these
masses to be saved from the [[tyranny]] of the more wealthy? is it by adding
to the wealthy further and more systematical means of oppressing them?
when we come to a balance of representation between corporate bodies [[body]],
provincial interests, emulations, and jealousies are full as likely to
arise among them as among individuals [[individual]]; and their divisions are likely to
produce a much hotter spirit of dissension, and something leading much
more nearly to a [[war]].

i see that these aristocratic masses are made upon what is called the
principle of direct contribution. nothing can be a more unequal standard
than this. the indirect contribution, that which arises from duties [[duty]] on
consumption, is in [[truth]] a [[better]] standard, and follows and discovers
wealth more naturally than this of direct contribution. it is difficult,
indeed, to fix a standard of local preference on account of the one, or
of the other, or of both, because some provinces may [[pay]] the more of
either or of both on account of causes not intrinsic, but originating
from those very districts over whom they have obtained a preference in
consequence of their ostensible contribution. if the masses were
independent, [[sovereign]] bodies [[body]], who were to provide for a federative
treasury by distinct contingents, and that the [[revenue]] had not (as it
has) many impositions running through the whole, which affect men
individually, and not corporately, and which, by their [[nature]], confound
all territorial limits, something might be said for the basis of
contribution as founded on masses. but, of all things, this
representation, to be measured by contribution, is the most difficult to
settle upon principles [[principle]] of equity in a [[country]] which considers its
districts as members of a whole. for a [[great]] [[city]], such as bordeaux or
paris, appears to [[pay]] a vast [[body]] of duties [[duty]], almost out of all
assignable proportion to other places, and its mass is considered
accordingly. but are these cities [[city]] the true contributors in that
proportion? no. the consumers of the commodities imported into bordeaux,
who are scattered through all [[france]], [[pay]] the import duties [[duty]] of bordeaux.
the [[produce]] of the vintage in guienne and languedoc give to that city
the means of its contribution growing out of an export commerce. the
landholders who spend their estates in [[paris]], and are thereby the
creators of that [[city]], contribute for [[paris]] from the provinces out of
which their revenues [[revenue]] arise. very nearly the same arguments will apply to
the representative share given on account of _direct_ contribution:
because the direct contribution must be assessed on [[wealth]], real or
presumed; and that local [[wealth]] will itself arise from causes not local,
and which therefore in equity ought not to [[produce]] a local preference.

it is very remarkable, that, in this fundamental regulation which
settles the representation of the mass upon the direct contribution,
they have not yet settled how that direct contribution shall be laid,
and how apportioned. perhaps there is some latent policy towards the
continuance of the [[present]] assembly in this [[strange]] procedure. however,
until they do this, they can have no [[certain]] [[constitution]]. it must
depend at [[last]] upon the [[system]] of [[taxation]], and must vary with every
variation in that [[system]]. as they have contrived matters, their taxation
does not so much depend on their [[constitution]] as their [[constitution]] on
their [[taxation]]. this must introduce [[great]] confusion among the masses; as
the variable qualification for votes within the district must, if ever
real contested elections take place, cause infinite internal
controversies.

to compare together the three bases, not on their [[political]] [[reason]], but
on the ideas [[idea]] on which the assembly works [[work]], and to try its consistency
with itself, we cannot avoid observing that the [[principle]] which the
committee call the basis of _population_ does not begin to operate from
the same point with the two other principles [[principle]], called the bases of
_territory_ and of _contribution_, which are both of an aristocratic
nature. the consequence is, that, where all three begin to operate
together, there is the most absurd inequality produced by the operation
of the former on the two latter principles [[principle]]. every canton contains four
square leagues, and is estimated to contain, on the average, 4,000
inhabitants, or 680 voters in the _primary assemblies_, which vary in
numbers with the [[population]] of the canton, and send _one deputy_ to the
_commune_ for every 200 voters. _nine cantons_ make a _commune_.

now let us take _a canton_ containing _a seaport town of trade_, or _a
great manufacturing town_. let us suppose the [[population]] of this canton
to be 12,700 inhabitants, or 2,193 voters, forming _three primary
assemblies_, and sending _ten deputies_ to the _commune_.

oppose to this _one_ canton _two_ others of the remaining eight in the
same commune. these we may suppose to have their [[fair]] [[population]], of
4,000 inhabitants, and 680 voters each, or 8,000 inhabitants and 1,360
voters, both together. these will form only _two primary assemblies_,
and send only _six_ deputies to the _commune_.

when the assembly of the _commune_ comes to vote on the _basis of
territory_, which [[principle]] is first admitted to operate in that
assembly, the _single canton_, which has _half_ the territory of the
_other two_, will have _ten_ voices to _six_ in the election of _three
deputies_ to the assembly of the department, chosen on the express
ground of a representation of territory. this inequality, striking as it
is, will be yet highly aggravated, if we suppose, as we fairly may, the
_several_ other cantons of the _commune_ to fall proportionally short of
the average [[population]], as much as the _principal canton_ exceeds it.

now as to _the basis of contribution_, which also is a principle
admitted first to operate in the assembly of the _commune_. let us again
take _one_ canton, such as is stated above. if the whole of the direct
contributions paid by a [[great]] trading or manufacturing town be divided
equally among the inhabitants, each [[individual]] will be found to [[pay]] much
more than an [[individual]] living in the [[country]] according to the same
average. the whole paid by the inhabitants of the former will be more
than the whole paid by the inhabitants of the latter,--we may fairly
assume one third more. then the 12,700 inhabitants, or 2,193 voters of
the canton, will [[pay]] as much as 19,050 inhabitants, or 3,289 voters of
the _other cantons_, which are nearly the estimated proportion of
inhabitants and voters of _five_ other cantons. now the 2,193 voters
will, as i before said, send only _ten_ deputies to the assembly; the
3,289 voters will send _sixteen_. thus, for an _equal_ share in the
contribution of the whole _commune_, there will be a difference of
_sixteen_ voices to _ten_ in voting for deputies to be chosen on the
principle of representing the general contribution of the whole
_commune_.

by the same mode of computation, we shall find 15,875 inhabitants, or
2,741 voters of the _other_ cantons, who [[pay]] _one sixth_ less to the
contribution of the whole _commune_, will have _three_ voices more than
the 12,700 inhabitants, or 2,193 voters of the _one_ canton.

such is the fantastical and [[unjust]] inequality between mass and mass, in
this [[curious]] repartition of the rights [[right]] of representation arising out of
_territory_ and _contribution_. the qualifications which these confer
are in [[truth]] negative qualifications, that give a [[right]] in an inverse
proportion to the possession of them.

in this whole contrivance of the three bases, consider it in any light
you please, i do not see a variety of objects reconciled in one
consistent whole, but several contradictory principles [[principle]] reluctantly and
irreconcilably brought and held together by your [[philosophers]], like wild
beasts shut up in a cage, to claw and bite each other to their mutual
destruction.

i am afraid i have gone too far into their way of considering the
formation of a [[constitution]]. they have much, but [[bad]],
metaphysics,--much, but [[bad]], geometry,--much, but false, proportionate
arithmetic; but if it were all as exact as metaphysics, geometry, and
arithmetic ought to be, and if their schemes were perfectly consistent
in all their parts, it would make only a more [[fair]] and sightly vision.
it is remarkable, that, in a [[great]] arrangement of [[mankind]], not one
reference whatsoever is to be found to anything [[moral]] or anything
politic,--nothing that relates to the concerns, the actions, the
passions, the interests of [[men]]. _hominem non sapiunt_.

you see i only consider this [[constitution]] as electoral, and leading by
steps to the national assembly. i do not enter into the internal
government of the departments, and their genealogy through the communes
and cantons. these local governments [[government]] are, in the original plan, to be as
nearly as possible composed in the same manner and on the same
principles with the elective assemblies. they are each of them bodies
perfectly compact and rounded in themselves.

you cannot but perceive in this scheme, that it has a direct and
immediate tendency to sever [[france]] into a variety of republics [[republic]], and to
render them totally independent of each other, without any direct
constitutional means of coherence, connection, or subordination, except
what may be derived from their acquiescence in the determinations of the
general congress of the ambassadors from each independent [[republic]]. such
in reality is the national assembly; and such governments [[government]], i admit, do
exist in the [[world]], though, in forms infinitely more suitable to the
local and habitual circumstances of their [[people]]. but such associations,
rather than bodies [[body]] [[politic]], have generally been the effect of necessity,
not [[choice]]; and i [[believe]] the [[present]] french [[power]] is the very first
body of [[citizens]] who, having obtained full [[authority]] to do with their
country what they pleased, have chosen to dissever it in this barbarous
manner.

it is impossible not to observe, that, in the spirit of this geometrical
distribution and arithmetical arrangement, these pretended citizens
treat [[france]] exactly like a [[country]] of [[conquest]]. acting as conquerors,
they have imitated the policy of the harshest of that harsh [[race]]. the
policy of such barbarous victors, who contemn a subdued [[people]], and
insult their feelings, has ever been, as much as in them lay, to destroy
all vestiges of the ancient [[country]], in [[religion]], in polity, in laws [[law]],
and in manners; to confound all territorial limits; to [[produce]] a general
poverty; to put up their properties [[property]] to auction; to crush their princes [[prince]],
nobles, and pontiffs; to lay low everything which had lifted its head
above the level, or which could serve to combine or rally, in their
distresses, the disbanded [[people]], under the standard of old [[opinion]].
they have made [[france]] [[free]] in the manner in which those sincere friends
to the rights [[right]] of [[mankind]], the romans, freed greece, macedon, and other
nations. they destroyed the bonds of their union, under color of
providing for the independence of each of their cities [[city]].

when the members who compose these new bodies [[body]] of cantons, communes, and
departments, arrangements purposely produced through the medium of
confusion, begin to act, they will find themselves in a [[great]] measure
strangers to one another. the electors and elected throughout,
especially in the rural _cantons_, will be frequently without any civil
habitudes or connections, or any of that [[natural]] discipline which is the
soul of a true [[republic]]. magistrates and collectors of [[revenue]] are now
no longer acquainted with their districts, bishops with their dioceses,
or curates with their parishes. these new colonies of the rights [[right]] of men
bear a [[strong]] resemblance to that sort of [[military]] colonies which
tacitus has observed upon in the declining policy of [[rome]]. in [[better]] and
wiser days (whatever course they took with [[foreign]] nations) they were
careful to make the elements of a methodical subordination and
settlement to be coeval, and even to lay the foundations of discipline
in the [[military]].[122] but when all the [[good]] [[arts]] had fallen into ruin,
they proceeded, as your assembly does, upon the equality of [[men]], and
with as little [[judgment]], and as little [[care]] for those things which make
a [[republic]] tolerable or durable. but in this, as well as almost every
instance, your new commonwealth is born and bred and fed in those
corruptions which mark degenerated and worn-out republics [[republic]]. your child
comes into the [[world]] with the symptoms of [[death]]; the _facies
hippocratica_ forms the [[character]] of its physiognomy and the prognostic
of its [[fate]].

the legislators who framed the ancient republics [[republic]] knew that their
business was too arduous to be accomplished with no [[better]] apparatus
than the metaphysics of an undergraduate and the mathematics and
arithmetic of an exciseman. they had to do with [[men]], and they were
obliged to study [[human]] [[nature]]. they had to do with [[citizens]], and they
were obliged to study the effects of those habits which are
communicated by the circumstances of civil [[life]]. they were sensible
that the operation of this second [[nature]] on the first produced a new
combination,--and thence arose many diversities amongst [[men]], according
to their birth, their [[education]], their professions, the periods of their
lives, their residence in towns or in the [[country]], their several ways of
acquiring and of fixing [[property]], and according to the quality of the
property itself, all which rendered them, as it were, so many different
species of animals. from hence they [[thought]] themselves obliged to
dispose their [[citizens]] into such classes, and to place them in such
situations in the [[state]], as their peculiar habits might qualify them to
fill, and to allot to them such appropriated privileges [[privilege]] as might secure
to them what their specific occasions [[occasion]] required, and which might furnish
to each description such [[force]] as might [[protect]] it in the conflict
caused by the [[diversity]] of interests that must [[exist]], and must contend,
in all complex [[society]]: for the legislator would have been ashamed that
the coarse husbandman should well [[know]] how to assort and to use his
sheep, horses, and oxen, and should have enough of [[common]] sense not to
abstract and equalize them all into animals, without providing for each
kind an appropriate food, [[care]], and employment,--whilst he, the
economist, disposer, and shepherd of his own kindred, subliming himself
into an airy metaphysician, was resolved to [[know]] nothing of his flocks
but as [[men]] in general. it is for this [[reason]] that montesquieu observed,
very justly, that, in their classification of the [[citizens]], the great
legislators of antiquity made the [[greatest]] display of their powers [[power]], and
even soared above themselves. it is here that your [[modern]] legislators
have gone deep into the negative series, and sunk even below their own
nothing. as the first sort of legislators attended to the different
kinds of [[citizens]], and combined them into one commonwealth, the others,
the metaphysical and alchemistical legislators, have taken the directly
contrary course. they have attempted to confound all sorts of [[citizens]],
as well as they could, into one homogeneous mass; and then they divided
this their amalgama into a number of incoherent republics [[republic]]. they reduce
men to loose counters, merely for the sake of simple telling, and not to
figures, whose [[power]] is to arise from their place in the table. the
elements of their own metaphysics might have taught them [[better]] lessons.
the troll of their categorical table might have informed them that there
was something else in the intellectual [[world]] besides _substance_ and
_quantity_. they might learn from the catechism of metaphysics that
there were eight heads more,[123] in every complex deliberation, which
they have never [[thought]] of; though these, of all the ten, are the
subject on which the [[skill]] of [[man]] can operate anything at all.

so far from this able disposition of some of the old republican
legislators, which follows with a solicitous accuracy the moral
conditions and propensities of [[men]], they have levelled and crushed
together all the orders which they found, even under the coarse,
unartificial arrangement of the [[monarchy]], in which mode of government
the classing of the [[citizens]] is not of so much importance as in a
republic. it is true, however, that every such classification, if
properly ordered, is [[good]] in all forms of [[government]], and composes a
strong barrier against the excesses of despotism, as well as it is the
necessary means of giving effect and permanence to a [[republic]]. for want
of something of this [[kind]], if the [[present]] project of a [[republic]] should
fail, all securities to a moderated [[freedom]] fail along with it, all the
indirect restraints which mitigate despotism are removed; insomuch that,
if [[monarchy]] should ever again obtain an entire ascendency in [[france]],
under this or any other dynasty, it will probably be, if not voluntarily
tempered, at setting out, by the [[wise]] and [[virtuous]] counsels of the
prince, the most completely arbitrary [[power]] that has ever appeared on
earth. this is to play a most desperate game.

the confusion which attends on all such proceedings they even declare to
be one of their objects, and they [[hope]] to secure their [[constitution]] by a
terror of a return of those evils [[evil]] which attended their making it. "by
this," say they, "its destruction will become difficult to [[authority]],
which cannot break it up without the entire disorganization of the whole
state." they presume, that, if this [[authority]] should ever come to the
same [[degree]] of [[power]] that they have acquired, it would make a more
moderate and chastised use of it, and would piously tremble entirely to
disorganize the [[state]] in the savage manner that they have done. they
expect from the virtues [[virtue]] of returning despotism the security which is to
be enjoyed by the offspring of their popular vices [[vice]].

i [[wish]], sir, that you and my readers would give an attentive perusal to
the [[work]] of m. de calonne on this [[subject]]. it is, indeed, not only an
eloquent, but an able and instructive performance. i confine myself to
what he says relative to the [[constitution]] of the new [[state]], and to the
condition of the [[revenue]]. as to the disputes of this minister with his
rivals, i do not [[wish]] to pronounce upon them. as little do i mean to
hazard any [[opinion]] concerning his ways and means, financial or
political, for taking his [[country]] out of its [[present]] disgraceful and
deplorable situation of servitude, [[anarchy]], bankruptcy, and beggary. i
cannot speculate quite so sanguinely as he does: but he is a frenchman,
and has a closer [[duty]] relative to those objects, and [[better]] means of
judging of them, than i can have. i [[wish]] that the formal avowal which he
refers to, made by one of the principal leaders in the assembly,
concerning the tendency of their scheme to bring [[france]] not only from a
monarchy to a [[republic]], but from a [[republic]] to a mere confederacy, may
be very particularly attended to. it adds new [[force]] to my observations:
and, indeed, m. de calonne's [[work]] supplies my deficiencies by many new
and striking arguments on most of the subjects [[subject]] of this letter.[124]

it is this resolution to break their [[country]] into separate republics
which has driven them into the [[greatest]] number of their difficulties and
contradictions. if it were not for this, all the questions [[question]] of exact
equality, and these balances, never to be settled, of [[individual]] rights [[right]],
population, and contribution, would be wholly useless. the
representation, though derived from parts, would be a [[duty]] which equally
regarded the whole. each deputy to the assembly would be the
representative of [[france]], and of all its descriptions, of the many and
of the few, of the [[rich]] and of the [[poor]], of the [[great]] districts and of
the small. all these districts would themselves be subordinate to some
standing [[authority]], existing independently of them,--an [[authority]] in
which their representation, and everything that belongs to it,
originated, and to which it was pointed. this standing, unalterable,
fundamental [[government]] would make, and it is the only thing which could
make, that territory truly and properly a whole. with us, when we elect
popular representatives, we send them to a council in which each man
individually is a [[subject]], and submitted to a [[government]] complete in all
its ordinary functions. with you the elective assembly is the [[sovereign]],
and the sole [[sovereign]]; all the members are therefore integral parts of
this sole sovereignty. but with us it is totally different. with us the
representative, separated from the other parts, can have no action and
no existence. the [[government]] is the point of reference of the several
members and districts of our representation. this is the centre of our
unity. this [[government]] of reference is a trustee for the _whole_, and
not for the parts. so is the other branch of our [[public]] council: i mean
the house of lords [[lord]]. with us the [[king]] and the lords [[lord]] are several and joint
securities for the equality of each district, each province, each [[city]].
when did you hear in [[great]] [[britain]] of any province suffering from the
inequality of its representation? what district from having no
representation at all? not only our [[monarchy]] and our peerage secure the
equality on which our unity depends, but it is the spirit of the house
of commons [[common]] itself. the very inequality of representation, which is so
foolishly complained of, is perhaps the very thing which prevents us
from thinking or acting as members for districts. cornwall elects as
many members as all [[scotland]]. but is cornwall [[better]] taken [[care]] of than
scotland? few trouble their heads about any of your bases, out of some
giddy clubs. most of those who [[wish]] for any [[change]], upon any plausible
grounds, [[desire]] it on different ideas [[idea]].

your new [[constitution]] is the very reverse of ours in its [[principle]]; and
i am astonished how any persons [[person]] could [[dream]] of holding out anything done
in it as an [[example]] for [[great]] [[britain]]. with you there is little, or
rather no, connection between the [[last]] representative and the first
constituent. the member who goes to the national assembly is not chosen
by the [[people]], nor accountable to them. there are three elections before
he is chosen; two sets of magistracy intervene between him and the
primary assembly, so as to render him, as i have said, an ambassador of
a [[state]], and not the representative of the [[people]] within a [[state]]. by
this the whole spirit of the election is changed; nor can any corrective
your constitution-mongers have devised render him anything else than
what he is. the very attempt to do it would inevitably introduce a
confusion, if possible, more horrid than the [[present]]. there is no way to
make a connection between the original constituent and the
representative, but by the circuitous means which may lead the candidate
to apply in the first instance to the primary electors, in order that by
their authoritative instructions (and something more perhaps) these
primary electors may [[force]] the two succeeding bodies [[body]] of electors to make
a [[choice]] agreeable to their wishes [[wish]]. but this would plainly subvert the
whole scheme. it would be to plunge them back into that tumult and
confusion of popular election, which, by their interposed gradation of
elections, they mean to avoid, and at length to risk the whole fortune
of the [[state]] with those who have the least [[knowledge]] of it and the
least interest in it. this is a perpetual dilemma, into which they are
thrown by the vicious, [[weak]], and contradictory principles [[principle]] they have
chosen. unless the [[people]] break up and level this gradation, it is plain
that they do not at all substantially elect to the assembly; indeed,
they elect as little in appearance as reality.

what is it we all seek for in an election? to [[answer]] its real purposes [[purpose]],
you must first possess the means of knowing the fitness of your [[man]]; and
then you must retain some hold upon him by personal obligation or
dependence. for what end are these primary electors complimented, or
rather mocked, with a [[choice]]? they can never [[know]] anything of the
qualities of him that is to serve them, nor has he any obligation
whatsoever to them. of all the powers [[power]] unfit to be delegated by those who
have any real means of judging, that most peculiarly unfit is what
relates to a _personal_ [[choice]]. in case of [[abuse]], that [[body]] of primary
electors never can call the representative to an account for his
conduct. he is too far removed from them in the chain of representation.
if he acts improperly at the end of his two years' lease, it does not
concern him for two years more. by the new french [[constitution]] the best
and the wisest representatives go equally with the worst into this
_limbus patrum_. their bottoms are supposed foul, and they must go into
dock to be refitted. every [[man]] who has served in an assembly is
ineligible for two years after. just as these magistrates begin to learn
their [[trade]], like chimney-sweepers, they are disqualified for exercising
it. superficial, new, petulant acquisition, and interrupted, dronish,
broken, ill recollection, is to be the destined [[character]] of all your
future governors. your [[constitution]] has too much of [[jealousy]] to have
much of sense in it. you consider the breach of trust in the
representative so principally that you do not at all regard the question
of his fitness to execute it.

this [[purgatory]] interval is not unfavorable to a faithless
representative, who may be as [[good]] a canvasser as he was a [[bad]] governor.
in this [[time]] he may cabal himself into a superiority over the wisest and
most [[virtuous]]. as, in the end, all the members of this elective
constitution are equally fugitive, and [[exist]] only for the election, they
may be no longer the same persons [[person]] who had chosen him, to whom he is to
be responsible when he solicits for a renewal of his trust. to call all
the secondary electors of the _commune_ to account is ridiculous,
impracticable, and [[unjust]]: they may themselves have been deceived in
their [[choice]], as the third set of electors, those of the _department_,
may be in theirs. in your elections responsibility cannot [[exist]].

finding no sort of [[principle]] of coherence with each other in the nature
and [[constitution]] of the several new republics [[republic]] of [[france]], i considered
what cement the legislators had provided for them from any extraneous
materials. their confederations, their _spectacles_, their civic feasts,
and their enthusiasm i take no notice of; they are nothing but mere
tricks; but tracing their policy through their actions, i [[think]] i can
distinguish the arrangements by which they propose to hold these
republics together. the first is the _confiscation_, with the compulsory
paper currency annexed to it; the second is the supreme [[power]] of the
city of [[paris]]; the third is the general [[army]] of the [[state]]. of this last
i shall reserve what i have to say, until i come to consider the army
as an head by itself.

as to the operation of the first (the confiscation and paper currency)
merely as a cement, i cannot deny that these, the one depending on the
other, may for some [[time]] compose some sort of cement, if their madness
and folly in the management, and in the tempering of the parts together,
does not [[produce]] a repulsion in the very outset. but allowing to the
scheme some coherence and some duration, it appears to me, that, if,
after a while, the confiscation should not be found sufficient to
support the paper coinage, (as i am morally [[certain]] it will not,) then,
instead of cementing, it will add infinitely to the dissociation,
distraction, and confusion of these confederate republics [[republic]], both with
relation to each other and to the several parts within themselves. but
if the confiscation should so far succeed as to sink the paper currency,
the cement is gone with the circulation. in the mean [[time]] its binding
force will be very uncertain, and it will straiten or relax with every
variation in the credit of the paper.

one thing only is [[certain]] in this scheme, which is an effect seemingly
collateral, but direct, i have no [[doubt]], in the minds [[mind]] of those who
conduct this [[business]]; that is, its effect in producing an _oligarchy_
in every one of the republics [[republic]]. a paper circulation, not founded on any
real [[money]] deposited or engaged for, amounting already to four-and-forty
millions of english [[money]], and this currency by [[force]] substituted in the
place of the coin of the [[kingdom]], becoming thereby the substance of its
revenue, as well as the medium of all its commercial and civil
intercourse, must put the whole of what [[power]], [[authority]], and influence
is left, in any form whatsoever it may assume, into the hands of the
managers and conductors of this circulation.

in [[england]] we [[feel]] the influence of the bank, though it is only the
centre of a voluntary dealing. he knows [[know]] little, indeed, of the influence
of [[money]] upon [[mankind]], who does not see the [[force]] of the management of a
moneyed concern which is so much more extensive, and in its [[nature]] so
much more depending on the managers, than any of ours. but this is not
merely a [[money]] concern. there is another member in the system
inseparably connected with this [[money]] management. it consists in the
means of drawing out at discretion portions of the confiscated lands [[land]] for
sale, and carrying on a process of continual transmutation of paper into
land and [[land]] into paper. when we [[follow]] this process in its effects, we
may conceive something of the intensity of the [[force]] with which this
system must operate. by this means the spirit of money-jobbing and
speculation goes into the mass of [[land]] itself, and incorporates with it.
by this [[kind]] of operation, that [[species]] of [[property]] becomes, as it were,
volatilized; it assumes an unnatural and monstrous activity, and thereby
throws into the hands of the several managers, principal and
subordinate, parisian and provincial, all the representative of [[money]],
and perhaps a full tenth part of all the [[land]] in [[france]], which has now
acquired the worst and most pernicious part of the [[evil]] of a paper
circulation, the [[greatest]] possible uncertainty in its value. they have
reversed the latonian [[kindness]] to the landed [[property]] of delos. they
have sent theirs to be blown about, like the [[light]] fragments of a wreck,
_oras et littora circum_.

the new dealers, being all habitually adventurers, and without any fixed
habits or local predilections, will purchase to [[job]] out again, as the
market of paper or of [[money]] or of [[land]] shall [[present]] an advantage. for
though a holy bishop thinks [[think]] that agriculture will derive great
advantages from the "_enlightened_" usurers who are to purchase the
church confiscations, i, who am not a [[good]], but an old [[farmer]], with
great [[humility]] beg leave to tell his late lordship that usury is not a
tutor of agriculture; and if the word "enlightened" be understood
according to the new dictionary, as it always is in your new schools, i
cannot conceive how a man's [[man]] not believing in [[god]] can [[teach]] him to
cultivate the [[earth]] with the least of any additional [[skill]] or
encouragement. "_diis immortalibus sero_," said an old roman, when he
held one handle of the plough, whilst [[death]] held the other. though you
were to join in the commission all the directors of the two academies to
the directors of the _caisse d'escompte_, an old experienced peasant is
worth them all. i have got more information upon a [[curious]] and
interesting branch of husbandry, in one short conversation with an old
carthusian monk, than i have derived from all the bank directors that i
have ever conversed with. however, there is no cause for apprehension
from the meddling of money-dealers with rural economy. these gentlemen
are too [[wise]] in their [[generation]]. at first, perhaps, their tender and
susceptible imaginations [[imagination]] may be captivated with the [[innocent]] and
unprofitable delights of a pastoral [[life]]; but in a little [[time]] they will
find that agriculture is a [[trade]] much more laborious and much less
lucrative than that which they had left. after making its panegyric,
they will turn their backs on it, like their [[great]] precursor and
prototype. they may, like him, begin by singing, "_beatus ille_"--but
what will be the end?

    hæc ubi locutus fœnerator alphius,
      jam jam futurus rusticus,
    omnem relegit idibus pecuniam,
      quærit calendis ponere.

they will cultivate the _caisse d'église_, under the [[sacred]] auspices of
this prelate, with much more [[profit]] than its vineyards and its
corn-fields. they will employ their [[talents]] according to their habits
and their interests. they will not [[follow]] the plough, whilst they can
direct treasuries and govern provinces.

your legislators, in everything new, are the very first who have founded
a commonwealth upon gaming, and infused this spirit into it as its vital
breath. the [[great]] object in these [[politics]] is to metamorphose france
from a [[great]] [[kingdom]] into one [[great]] play-table,--to turn its inhabitants
into a nation of gamesters,--to make speculation as extensive as
life,--to mix it with all its concerns,--and to divert the whole of the
hopes and fears [[fear]] of the [[people]] from their usual channels into the
impulses, [[passions]], and superstitions of those who [[live]] on chances [[chance]]. they
loudly proclaim their [[opinion]], that this their [[present]] [[system]] of a
republic cannot possibly [[exist]] without this [[kind]] of gaming fund, and
that the very thread of its [[life]] is spun out of the staple of these
speculations. the old gaming in funds was mischievous enough,
undoubtedly; but it was so only to individuals [[individual]]. even when it had its
greatest extent, in the mississippi and south sea, it affected but few,
comparatively; where it extends further, as in lotteries, the spirit has
but a [[single]] object. but where the [[law]], which in most circumstances
forbids, and in none countenances gaming, is itself debauched, so as to
reverse its [[nature]] and policy, and expressly to [[force]] the [[subject]] to
this destructive table, by bringing the spirit and symbols of gaming
into the minutest matters, and engaging everybody in it, and in
everything, a more dreadful epidemic distemper of that [[kind]] is spread
than yet has appeared in the [[world]]. with you a [[man]] can neither earn nor
buy his dinner without a speculation. what he receives in the morning
will not have the same value at night. what he is compelled to take as
pay for an old debt will not be received as the same, when he comes to
pay a debt contracted by himself; nor will it be the same, when by
prompt payment he would avoid contracting any debt at all. industry must
wither away. economy must be driven from your [[country]]. careful provision
will have no existence. who will labor without knowing the amount of his
pay? who will study to increase what none can estimate? who will
accumulate, when he does not [[know]] the value of what he saves? if you
abstract it from its uses in gaming, to accumulate your paper wealth
would be, not the providence of a [[man]], but the distempered instinct of a
jackdaw.

the truly melancholy part of the policy of systematically making a
nation of gamesters is this,--that, though all are forced to play, few
can [[understand]] the game, and fewer still are in a condition to avail
themselves of that [[knowledge]]. the many must be the dupes of the few who
conduct the machine of these speculations. what effect it must have on
the country-people is visible. the townsman can calculate from day to
day; not so the inhabitant of the [[country]]. when the peasant first brings
his corn to market, the magistrate in the towns obliges him to take the
assignat at par; when he goes to the shop with this [[money]], he finds it
seven per cent the worse for crossing the way. this market he will not
readily resort to again. the towns-people will be inflamed; they will
force the country-people to bring their corn. [[resistance]] will begin, and
the murders of [[paris]] and st. denis may be renewed through all [[france]].

what signifies the empty compliment paid to the [[country]], by giving it,
perhaps, more than its share in the theory of your representation? where
have you placed the real [[power]] over moneyed and landed circulation?
where have you placed the means of raising and falling the value of
every man's [[man]] freehold? those whose operations can take from or add ten
per cent to the possessions of every [[man]] in [[france]] must be the masters
of every [[man]] in [[france]]. the whole of the [[power]] obtained by this
revolution will settle in the towns among the burghers, and the moneyed
directors who lead them. the landed gentleman, the yeoman, and the
peasant have, none of them, habits or inclinations or [[experience]] which
can lead them to any share in this the sole source of [[power]] and
influence now left in [[france]]. the very [[nature]] of a [[country]] [[life]], the
very [[nature]] of landed [[property]], in all the occupations and all the
pleasures they afford, render combination and arrangement (the sole way
of procuring and exerting influence) in a manner impossible amongst
country-people. combine them by all the art [[arts]] you can, and all the
industry, they are always dissolving into individuality. anything in the
nature of incorporation is almost impracticable amongst them. [[hope]],
fear, alarm, [[jealousy]], the ephemerous tale that does its [[business]] and
dies in a day, all these things, which are the reins and spurs by which
leaders check or urge the minds [[mind]] of followers, are not easily employed,
or hardly at all, amongst scattered [[people]]. they assemble, they arm,
they act, with the utmost difficulty, and at the [[greatest]] charge. their
efforts, if ever they can be commenced, cannot be sustained. they cannot
proceed systematically. if the country-gentlemen attempt an influence
through the mere income of their [[property]], what is it to that of those
who have ten times [[time]] their income to sell, and who can ruin their property
by bringing their plunder to meet it at market? if the landed [[man]] wishes
to mortgage, he falls the value of his [[land]] and raises the value of
assignats. he augments the [[power]] of his [[enemy]] by the very means he must
take to contend with him. the country-gentleman, therefore, the officer
by sea and [[land]], the [[man]] of liberal views and habits, attached to no
profession, will be as completely excluded from the [[government]] of his
country as if he were legislatively proscribed. it is obvious, that, in
the towns, all the things which conspire against the country-gentleman
combine in favor of the [[money]] manager and director. in towns combination
is [[natural]]. the habits of burghers, their occupations, their diversion,
their [[business]], their idleness, continually bring them into mutual
contact. their virtues [[virtue]] and their vices [[vice]] are sociable; they are always in
garrison; and they come embodied and half-disciplined into the hands of
those who mean to form them for civil or [[military]] action.

all these considerations leave no [[doubt]] on my [[mind]], that, if this
monster of a [[constitution]] can continue, [[france]] will be wholly governed
by the agitators in corporations, by societies [[society]] in the towns, formed of
directors in assignats, and trustees for the sale of [[church]] lands [[land]],
attorneys, agents, money-jobbers, speculators, and adventurers,
composing an ignoble [[oligarchy]], founded on the destruction of the [[crown]],
the [[church]], the nobility, and the [[people]]. here end all the deceitful
dreams and visions of the equality and rights [[right]] of [[men]]. in "the serbonian
bog" of this base [[oligarchy]] they are all absorbed, sunk, and lost
forever.

though [[human]] [[eyes]] cannot trace them, one would be tempted to [[think]] some
great offences in [[france]] must cry to [[heaven]], which has [[thought]] fit to
punish it with a subjection to a vile and inglorious domination, in
which no comfort or compensation is to be found in any even of those
false splendors which, playing about other tyrannies, prevent mankind
from feeling themselves dishonored even whilst they are [[oppressed]]. i
must confess i am touched with a [[sorrow]] mixed with some indignation, at
the conduct of a few [[men]], once of [[great]] rank, and still of great
character, who, deluded with specious names, have engaged in a business
too deep for the line of their understanding to fathom,--who have lent
their [[fair]] [[reputation]] and the [[authority]] of their high-sounding names to
the designs of [[men]] with whom they could not be acquainted, and have
thereby made their very virtues [[virtue]] operate to the ruin of their [[country]].

so far as to the first cementing [[principle]].

the second material of cement for their new [[republic]] is the superiority
of the [[city]] of [[paris]]; and this, i admit, is strongly connected with the
other cementing [[principle]] of paper circulation and confiscation. it is
in this part of the project we must look for the cause of the
destruction of all the old bounds of provinces and jurisdictions,
ecclesiastical and secular, and the dissolution of all ancient
combinations of things, as well as the formation of so many small
unconnected republics [[republic]]. the [[power]] of the [[city]] of [[paris]] is evidently one
great spring of all their [[politics]]. it is through the [[power]] of [[paris]],
now become the centre and focus of jobbing, that the leaders of this
faction direct, or rather command, the whole legislative and the whole
executive [[government]]. everything, therefore, must be done which can
confirm the [[authority]] of that [[city]] over the other republics [[republic]]. [[paris]] is
compact; she has an enormous [[strength]], wholly disproportioned to the
force of any of the square republics [[republic]]; and this [[strength]] is collected and
condensed within a narrow compass. [[paris]] has a [[natural]] and easy
connection of its parts, which will not be affected by any scheme of a
geometrical [[constitution]]; nor does it much signify whether its
proportion of representation be more or less, since it has the whole
draught of fishes in its drag-net. the other divisions of the [[kingdom]],
being hackled and torn to pieces, and separated from all their habitual
means and even principles [[principle]] of union, cannot, for some [[time]] at least,
confederate against her. nothing was to be left in all the subordinate
members, but weakness, disconnection, and confusion. to confirm this
part of the plan, the assembly has lately come to a resolution that no
two of their republics [[republic]] shall have the same commander-in-chief.

to a [[person]] who takes a view of the whole, the [[strength]] of [[paris]], thus
formed, will appear a [[system]] of general weakness. it is boasted that the
geometrical policy has been adopted, that all local ideas [[idea]] should be
sunk, and that the [[people]] should be no longer gascons, picards, bretons,
normans,--but frenchmen, with one [[country]], one [[heart]], and one assembly.
but, instead of being all frenchmen, the greater likelihood is that the
inhabitants of that region will shortly have no [[country]]. no [[man]] ever was
attached by a sense of [[pride]], partiality, or real affection, to a
description of square measurement. he never will [[glory]] in belonging to
the chequer no. 71, or to any other badge-ticket. we begin our public
affections in our families [[family]]. no cold relation is a zealous citizen. we
pass on to our neighborhoods, and our habitual provincial connections.
these are inns and resting-places. such divisions of our [[country]] as have
been formed by habit, and not by a sudden jerk of [[authority]], were so
many little images of the [[great]] [[country]], in which the [[heart]] found
something which it could fill. the [[love]] to the whole is not extinguished
by this subordinate partiality. perhaps it is a sort of elemental
training to those higher and more large regards by which alone [[men]] come
to be affected, as with their own concern, in the [[prosperity]] of a
kingdom so extensive as that of [[france]]. in that general territory
itself, as in the old name of provinces, the [[citizens]] are interested
from old prejudices and unreasoned habits, and not on account of the
geometric properties [[property]] of its figure. the [[power]] and preëminence of paris
does certainly press down and hold these republics [[republic]] together as long as
it lasts: but, for the reasons [[reason]] i have already given you, i [[think]] it can
not [[last]] very long.

passing from the civil creating and the civil cementing principles [[principle]] of
this [[constitution]] to the national assembly, which is to appear and act
as [[sovereign]], we see a [[body]] in its [[constitution]] with every possible
power and no possible external control. we see a [[body]] without
fundamental laws [[law]], without established maxims [[maxim]], without respected rules [[rule]] of
proceeding, which nothing can keep firm to any [[system]] whatsoever. their
idea of their powers [[power]] is always taken at the utmost stretch of
legislative competency, and their examples [[example]] for [[common]] cases from the
exceptions of the most urgent necessity. the future is to be in most
respects like the [[present]] assembly; but, by the mode of the new
elections and the tendency of the new circulations, it will be purged of
the small [[degree]] of internal control existing in a minority chosen
originally from various interests, and preserving something of their
spirit. if possible, the next assembly must be worse than the [[present]].
the [[present]], by destroying and altering everything, will leave to their
successors apparently nothing popular to do. they will be roused by
emulation and [[example]] to enterprises the boldest and the most absurd. to
suppose such an assembly sitting in [[perfect]] quietude is ridiculous.

your all-sufficient legislators, in their hurry to do everything at
once, have forgot one thing that seems essential, and which, i [[believe]],
never has been before, in the theory or the practice, omitted by any
projector of a [[republic]]. they have forgot to constitute a _senate_, or
something of that [[nature]] and [[character]]. never, before this [[time]], was
heard of a [[body]] [[politic]] composed of one legislative and active assembly,
and its executive officers, without such a council: without something to
which [[foreign]] states might connect themselves,--something to which, in
the ordinary detail of [[government]], the [[people]] could look up,--something
which might give a bias and steadiness, and preserve something like
consistency in the proceedings of [[state]]. such a [[body]] kings [[king]] generally
have as a council. a [[monarchy]] may [[exist]] without it; but it seems to be
in the very essence of a republican [[government]]. it holds a sort of
middle place between the supreme [[power]] exercised by the [[people]], or
immediately delegated from them, and the mere executive. of this there
are no traces in your [[constitution]]; and in providing nothing of this
kind, your solons and numas have, as much as in anything else,
discovered a [[sovereign]] incapacity.

let us now turn our [[eyes]] to what they have done towards the formation of
an executive [[power]]. for this they have chosen a degraded [[king]]. this
their first executive officer is to be a machine, without any sort of
deliberative discretion in any one act of his function. at [[best]], he is
but a channel to convey to the national assembly such matter as may
import that [[body]] to [[know]]. if he had been made the exclusive channel, the
power would not have been without its importance, though infinitely
perilous to those who would choose to exercise it. but public
intelligence and statement of facts [[fact]] may pass to the assembly with equal
authenticity through any other conveyance. as to the means, therefore,
of giving a direction to measures by the statement of an authorized
reporter, this office of [[intelligence]] is as nothing.

to consider the french scheme of an executive officer, in its two
natural divisions of civil and [[political]].--in the first it must be
observed, that, according to the new [[constitution]], the higher parts of
judicature, in either of its lines, are not in the [[king]]. the [[king]] of
france is not the fountain of [[justice]]. the judges [[judge]], neither the original
nor the appellate, are of his nomination. he neither proposes the
candidates nor has a negative on the [[choice]]. he is not even the public
prosecutor. he serves only as a notary, to authenticate the [[choice]] made
of the judges [[judge]] in the several districts. by his officers he is to execute
their sentence. when we look into the true [[nature]] of his [[authority]], he
appears to be nothing more than a [[chief]] of bumbailiffs,
sergeants-at-mace, catchpoles, jailers, and hangmen. it is impossible to
place anything called royalty in a more degrading point of view. a
thousand times [[time]] [[better]] it had been for the [[dignity]] of this unhappy
prince, that he had nothing at all to do with the administration of
justice, deprived as he is of all that is venerable and all that is
consolatory in that function, without [[power]] of originating any process,
without a [[power]] of suspension, mitigation, or pardon. everything in
justice that is vile and odious is thrown upon him. it was not for
nothing that the assembly has been at such pains [[pain]] to remove the stigma
from [[certain]] offices, when they were resolved to place the [[person]] who
had lately been their [[king]] in a situation but one [[degree]] above the
executioner, and in an office nearly of the same quality. it is not in
nature, that, situated as the [[king]] of the french now is, he can respect
himself or can be respected by others.

view this new executive officer on the side of his [[political]] capacity,
as he acts under the orders of the national assembly. to execute laws [[law]] is
a [[royal]] office; to execute orders is not to be a [[king]]. however, a
political executive magistracy, though merely such, is a [[great]] trust. it
is a trust, indeed, that has much depending upon its faithful and
diligent performance, both in the [[person]] presiding in it and in all its
subordinates. means of performing this [[duty]] ought to be given by
regulation; and dispositions towards it ought to be infused by the
circumstances attendant on the trust. it ought to be environed with
dignity, [[authority]], and consideration, and it ought to lead to [[glory]].
the office of execution is an office of exertion. it is not from
impotence we are to expect the tasks of [[power]]. what sort of [[person]] is a
king to command executory service, who has no means whatsoever to reward
it:--not in a permanent office; not in a grant of [[land]]; no, not in a
pension of fifty pounds a year; not in the vainest and most trivial
title? in [[france]] the [[king]] is no more the fountain of [[honor]] than he is
the fountain of [[justice]]. all rewards [[reward]], all distinctions, are in other
hands. those who serve the [[king]] can be actuated by no [[natural]] motive but
fear,--by a [[fear]] of everything except their master. his functions of
internal coercion are as odious as those which he exercises in the
department of [[justice]]. if relief is to be given to any municipality, the
assembly gives it. if [[troops]] are to be sent to reduce them to obedience
to the assembly, the [[king]] is to execute the order; and upon every
occasion he is to be spattered over with the [[blood]] of his [[people]]. he has
no negative; yet his name and [[authority]] is used to enforce every harsh
decree. nay, he must concur in the butchery of those who shall attempt
to [[free]] him from his imprisonment, or show the slightest attachment to
his [[person]] or to his ancient [[authority]].

executive magistracy ought to be constituted in such a manner that those
who compose it should be disposed to [[love]] and to venerate those whom
they are bound to obey. a purposed neglect, or, what is worse, a
literal, but perverse and malignant [[obedience]], must be the ruin of the
wisest counsels. in [[vain]] will the [[law]] attempt to anticipate or to follow
such [[studied]] neglects and fraudulent attentions. to make them act
zealously is not in the competence of [[law]]. kings [[king]], even such as are truly
kings, may and ought to bear the [[freedom]] of subjects [[subject]] that are obnoxious
to them. they may, too, without derogating from themselves, bear even
the [[authority]] of such persons [[person]], if it promotes their service. louis the
thirteenth mortally hated the cardinal de richelieu; but his support of
that minister against his rivals was the source of all the [[glory]] of his
reign, and the solid foundation of his [[throne]] itself. louis the
fourteenth, when come to the [[throne]], did not [[love]] the cardinal mazarin;
but for his interests he preserved him in [[power]]. when old, he detested
louvois; but for years, whilst he faithfully served his greatness, he
endured his [[person]]. when george the second took mr. pitt, who certainly
was not agreeable to him, into his councils, he did nothing which could
humble a [[wise]] [[sovereign]]. but these ministers, who were chosen by
affairs, not by affections, acted in the name of and in trust for kings [[king]],
and not as their avowed constitutional and ostensible masters. i think
it impossible that any [[king]], when he has recovered his first terrors,
can cordially infuse vivacity and vigor into measures which he knows [[know]] to
be dictated by those who, he must be persuaded, are in the highest
degree ill affected to his [[person]]. will any ministers, who serve such a
king (or whatever he may be called) with but a decent appearance of
respect, cordially obey the orders of those whom but the other day in
his name they had committed to the bastile? will they obey the orders
of those whom, whilst they were exercising despotic [[justice]] upon them,
they conceived they were treating with lenity, and for whom in a prison
they [[thought]] they had provided an asylum? if you expect such [[obedience]],
amongst your other innovations and regenerations, you ought to make a
revolution in [[nature]], and provide a new [[constitution]], for the human
mind: otherwise your supreme [[government]] cannot harmonize with its
executory [[system]]. there are cases in which we cannot take up with names
and abstractions. you may call half a dozen leading individuals [[individual]], whom we
have [[reason]] to [[fear]] and hate, the nation. it makes no other difference
than to make us [[fear]] and hate them the more. if it had been thought
justifiable and expedient to make such a [[revolution]] by such means and
through such persons [[person]] as you have made yours, it would have been more
wise to have completed the [[business]] of the fifth and sixth of october.
the new executive officer would then owe his situation to those who are
his creators as well as his masters; and he might be bound in interest,
in the [[society]] of crime, and (if in crimes there could be virtues) in
gratitude, to serve those who had promoted him to a place of [[great]] lucre
and [[great]] sensual indulgence,--and of something more: for more he must
have received from those who certainly would not have limited an
aggrandized creature as they have done a submitting antagonist.

a [[king]] circumstanced as the [[present]], if he is totally stupefied by his
misfortunes, so as to [[think]] it not the necessity, but the premium and
privilege of [[life]], to [[eat]] and sleep, without any regard to [[glory]], can
never be fit for the office. if he feels [[feel]] as [[men]] commonly [[feel]], he must
he sensible that an office so circumstanced is one in which he can
obtain no fame or [[reputation]]. he has no generous interest that can
excite him to action. at [[best]], his conduct will be passive and
defensive. to inferior [[people]] such an office might be matter of [[honor]].
but to be raised to it and to descend to it are different things, and
suggest different sentiments. does he _really_ name the ministers? they
will have a sympathy with him. are they forced upon him? the whole
business between them and the nominal [[king]] will be mutual counteraction.
in all other countries [[country]] the office of ministers of [[state]] is of the
highest [[dignity]]. in [[france]] it is full of peril, and incapable of [[glory]].
rivals, however, they will have in their nothingness, whilst shallow
ambition exists in the [[world]], or the [[desire]] of a miserable salary is an
incentive to short-sighted avarice. those competitors of the ministers
are enabled by your [[constitution]] to attack them in their vital parts,
whilst they have not the means of repelling their charges in any other
than the degrading [[character]] of culprits. the ministers of [[state]] in
prance are the only persons [[person]] in that [[country]] who are incapable of a share
in the national councils. what ministers! what councils! what a
nation!--but they are responsible. it is a [[poor]] service that is to be
had from responsibility. the elevation of [[mind]] to be derived from fear
will never make a nation glorious. responsibility prevents crimes. it
makes all attempts against the laws [[law]] dangerous. but for a [[principle]] of
active and zealous service, none but idiots could [[think]] of it. is the
conduct of a [[war]] to be trusted to a [[man]] who may abhor its
principle,--who, in every step he may take to render it successful,
confirms the [[power]] of those by whom he is [[oppressed]]? will foreign
states seriously treat with him who has no prerogative of [[peace]] or
war,--no, not so much as in a [[single]] vote by himself or his ministers,
or by any one whom he can possibly influence? a [[state]] of contempt is not
a [[state]] for a [[prince]]: [[better]] get rid of him at once.

i [[know]] it will be said that these humors in the court and executive
government will continue only through this [[generation]], and that the king
has been brought to declare the dauphin shall be educated in a
conformity to his situation. if he is made to conform to his situation,
he will have no [[education]] at all. his training must be worse even than
that of an arbitrary monarch. if he reads,--whether he reads or not,
some [[good]] or [[evil]] genius will tell him his [[ancestors]] were kings [[king]].
thenceforward his object must be to assert himself and to avenge his
parents. this you will say is not his [[duty]]. that may be; but it is
nature; and whilst you pique [[nature]] against you, you do unwisely to
trust to [[duty]]. in this futile scheme of polity, the [[state]] nurses in its
bosom, for the [[present]], a source of weakness, perplexity, counteraction,
inefficiency, and decay; and it prepares the means of its final ruin. in
short, i see nothing in the executive [[force]] (i cannot call it authority)
that has even an appearance of vigor, or that has the smallest [[degree]] of
just correspondence or symmetry or amicable relation with the supreme
power, either as it now exists, or as it is planned for the future
government.

you have settled, by an economy as perverted as the policy, two[125]
establishments of [[government]],--one real, one fictitious: both
maintained at a vast expense; but the fictitious at, i [[think]], the
greatest. such a machine as the latter is not worth the grease of its
wheels. the expense is exorbitant; and neither the show nor the use
deserve the tenth part of the charge.--oh! but i don't do [[justice]] to the
talents of the legislators: i don't allow, as i ought to do, for
necessity. their scheme of executive [[force]] was not their [[choice]]. this
pageant must be kept. the [[people]] would not [[consent]] to part with
it.--right: i [[understand]] you. you do, in spite of your grand theories,
to which you would have [[heaven]] and [[earth]] to bend, you do [[know]] how to
conform yourselves to the [[nature]] and circumstances of things. but when
you were obliged to conform thus far to circumstances, you ought to have
carried your submission farther, and to have made, what you were obliged
to take, a proper instrument, and useful to its end. that was in your
power. for instance, among many others, it was in your [[power]] to leave to
your [[king]] the [[right]] of [[peace]] and [[war]].--what! to leave to the executive
magistrate the most dangerous of all prerogatives?--i [[know]] none more
dangerous; nor any one more necessary to be so trusted. i do not say
that this prerogative ought to be trusted to your [[king]], unless he
enjoyed other auxiliary trusts along with it, which he does not now
hold. but, if he did possess them, hazardous as they are undoubtedly,
advantages would arise from such a [[constitution]], more than compensating
the risk. there is no other way of keeping the several potentates of
europe from intriguing distinctly and personally with the members of
your assembly, from intermeddling in all your concerns, and fomenting,
in the [[heart]] of your [[country]], the most pernicious of all
factions,--factions in the interest and under the direction of foreign
powers. from that worst of evils [[evil]], thank [[god]], we are still [[free]]. your
skill, if you had any, would be well employed to find out indirect
correctives and controls upon this perilous trust. if you did not like
those which in [[england]] we have chosen, your leaders might have exerted
their abilities in contriving [[better]]. if it were necessary to exemplify
the consequences of such an executive [[government]] as yours, in the
management of [[great]] affairs, i should refer you to the late reports of
m. de montmorin to the national assembly, and all the other proceedings
relative to the differences between [[great]] [[britain]] and [[spain]]. it would be
treating your understanding with disrespect to point them out to you.

i hear that the persons [[person]] who are called ministers have signified an
intention of resigning their places. i am rather astonished that they
have not resigned long since. for the [[universe]] i would not have stood in
the situation in which they have been for this [[last]] twelvemonth. they
wished well, i take it for granted, to the [[revolution]]. let this [[fact]] be
as it may, they could not, placed as they were upon an eminence, though
an eminence of humiliation, but be the first to see collectively, and to
feel each in his own department, the evils [[evil]] which have been produced by
that [[revolution]]. in every step which they took, or forbore to take, they
must have [[felt]] the degraded situation of their [[country]], and their utter
incapacity of serving it. they are in a [[species]] of subordinate servitude
in which no [[men]] before them were ever seen. without confidence from
their [[sovereign]] on whom they were forced, or from the assembly who
forced them upon him, all the [[noble]] functions of their office are
executed by committees of the assembly, without any regard whatsoever to
their personal or their official [[authority]]. they are to execute, without
power; they are to be responsible, without discretion; they are to
deliberate, without [[choice]]. in their puzzled situation, under two
sovereigns, over neither of whom they have any influence, they must act
in such a manner as (in effect, whatever they may intend) sometimes to
betray the one, sometimes the other, and always to betray themselves.
such has been their situation; such must be the situation of those who
succeed them. i have much [[respect]], and many [[good]] wishes [[wish]], for m. necker.
i am obliged to him for attentions. i [[thought]], when his enemies [[enemy]] had
driven him from versailles, that his [[exile]] was a [[subject]] of most serious
congratulation. _sed multæ urbes et publica vota vicerunt_. he is now
sitting on the ruins of the finances and of the [[monarchy]] of [[france]].

a [[great]] deal more might be observed on the [[strange]] [[constitution]] of the
executory part of the new [[government]]; but fatigue must give bounds to
the discussion of subjects [[subject]] which in themselves have hardly any limits.

as little genius and talent am i able to perceive in the plan of
judicature formed by the national assembly. according to their
invariable course, the framers of your [[constitution]] have begun with the
utter abolition of the parliaments. these venerable bodies [[body]], like the
rest of the old [[government]], stood in need of reform, even though there
should be no [[change]] made in the [[monarchy]]. they required several more
alterations to adapt them to the [[system]] of a [[free]] [[constitution]]. but
they had particulars in their [[constitution]], and those not a few, which
deserved approbation from the [[wise]]. they possessed one fundamental
excellence: they were independent. the most doubtful circumstance
attendant on their office, that of its being vendible, contributed,
however, to this independency of [[character]]. they held for [[life]]. indeed,
they may be said to have held by [[inheritance]]. appointed by the monarch,
they were considered as nearly out of his [[power]]. the most determined
exertions of that [[authority]] against them only showed their radical
independence. they composed permanent bodies [[body]] [[politic]], constituted to
resist arbitrary innovation; and from that corporate [[constitution]], and
from most of their forms, they were well calculated to afford both
certainty and stability to the laws [[law]]. they had been a safe asylum to
secure these laws [[law]], in all the revolutions [[revolution]] of humor and [[opinion]]. they had
saved that [[sacred]] deposit of the [[country]] during the reigns of arbitrary
princes and the struggles of arbitrary factions. they kept alive the
memory and record of the [[constitution]]. they were the [[great]] security to
private [[property]]; which might be said (when personal [[liberty]] had no
existence) to be, in [[fact]], as well guarded in [[france]] as in any other
country. whatever is supreme in a [[state]] ought to have, as much as
possible, ifs judicial [[authority]] so constituted as not only not to
depend upon it, but in some sort to balance it. it ought to give a
security to its [[justice]] against its [[power]]. it ought to make its
judicature, as it were, something exterior to the [[state]].

those parliaments had furnished, not the [[best]] certainly, but some
considerable corrective to the excesses and vices [[vice]] of the [[monarchy]]. such
an independent judicature was ten times [[time]] more necessary when a democracy
became the absolute [[power]] of the [[country]]. in that [[constitution]],
elective, temporary, local judges [[judge]], such as you have contrived,
exercising their dependent functions in a narrow [[society]], must be the
worst of all tribunals. in them it will be [[vain]] to look for any
appearance of [[justice]] towards strangers, towards the obnoxious [[rich]],
towards the minority of routed parties, towards all those who in the
election have supported unsuccessful candidates. it will be impossible
to keep the new tribunals clear of the worst spirit of faction. all
contrivances by ballot we [[know]] experimentally to be [[vain]] and childish to
prevent a discovery of inclinations. where they may the [[best]] [[answer]] the
purposes of concealment, they [[answer]] to [[produce]] suspicion, and this is a
still more mischievous cause of partiality.

if the parliaments had been preserved, instead of being dissolved at so
ruinous a [[change]] to the nation, they might have served in this new
commonwealth, perhaps not precisely the same, (i do not mean an exact
parallel,) but near the same purposes [[purpose]] as the court and senate of
areopagus did in [[athens]]: that is, as one of the balances and correctives
to the evils [[evil]] of a [[light]] and [[unjust]] [[democracy]]. every one knows [[know]] that this
tribunal was the [[great]] stay of that [[state]]; every one knows [[know]] with what
care it was upheld, and with what a [[religious]] awe it was consecrated.
the parliaments were not wholly [[free]] from faction, i admit; but this
evil was exterior and accidental, and not so much the [[vice]] of their
constitution itself as it must be in your new contrivance of sexennial
elective judicatories. several english commend the abolition of the old
tribunals, as supposing that they determined everything by bribery and
corruption. but they have stood the test of monarchic and republican
scrutiny. the court was well disposed to prove [[corruption]] on those
bodies, when they were dissolved in 1771; those who have again dissolved
them would have done the same, if they could; but both inquisitions
having failed, i conclude that gross pecuniary [[corruption]] must have been
rather rare amongst them.

it would have been prudent, along with the parliaments, to preserve
their ancient [[power]] of registering, and of remonstrating at least upon,
all the decrees of the national assembly, as they did upon those which
passed in the [[time]] of the [[monarchy]]. it would be a means of squaring the
occasional decrees of a [[democracy]] to some principles [[principle]] of general
jurisprudence. the [[vice]] of the ancient democracies [[democracy]], and one cause of
their ruin, was, that they ruled, as you do, by occasional decrees,
_psephismata_. this practice soon broke in upon the tenor and
consistency of the laws [[law]]; it abated the [[respect]] of the [[people]] towards
them, and totally destroyed them in the end.

your vesting the [[power]] of remonstrance, which, in the [[time]] of the
monarchy, existed in the [[parliament]] of [[paris]], in your principal
executive officer, whom, in spite of [[common]] sense, you persevere in
calling [[king]], is the height of absurdity. you ought never to suffer
remonstrance from him who is to execute. this is to [[understand]] neither
council nor execution, neither [[authority]] nor [[obedience]]. the [[person]] whom
you call [[king]] ought not to have this [[power]], or he ought to have more.

your [[present]] arrangement is strictly judicial. instead of imitating your
monarchy, and seating your judges [[judge]] on a bench of independence, your
object is to reduce them to the most blind [[obedience]]. as you have
changed all things, you have [[invented]] new principles [[principle]] of order. you first
appoint judges [[judge]], who, i suppose, are to determine according to [[law]], and
then you let them [[know]], that, at some [[time]] or other, you intend to give
them some [[law]] by which they are to determine. any studies which they
have made (if any they have made) are to be useless to them. but to
supply these studies, they are to be sworn to obey all the rules [[rule]],
orders, and instructions which from [[time]] to [[time]] they are to receive
from the national assembly. these if they submit to, they leave no
ground of [[law]] to the [[subject]]. they become complete and most dangerous
instruments in the hands of the governing [[power]], which, in the midst of
a cause, or on the prospect of it, may wholly [[change]] the [[rule]] of
decision. if these orders of the national assembly come to be contrary
to the will of the [[people]] who locally choose those judges [[judge]], such
confusion must happen as is terrible to [[think]] of. for the judges [[judge]] owe
their place to the local [[authority]], and the commands they are sworn to
obey come from those who have no share in their appointment. in the mean
time they have the [[example]] of the court of _châtelet_ to encourage and
guide them in the exercise of their functions. that court is to try
criminals sent to it by the national assembly, or brought before it by
other courses of delation. they sit under a guard to save their own
lives. they [[know]] not by what [[law]] they [[judge]], nor under what authority
they act, nor by what tenure they hold. it is [[thought]] that they are
sometimes obliged to condemn at peril of their lives [[life]]. this is not
perhaps [[certain]], nor can it be ascertained; but when they acquit, we
know they have seen the persons [[person]] whom they discharge, with perfect
impunity to the actors, [[hanged]] at the door of their court.

the assembly, indeed, promises that they will form a [[body]] of [[law]], which
shall be short, simple, clear, and so forth. that is, by their short
laws, they will leave much to the discretion of the [[judge]], whilst they
have exploded the [[authority]] of all the learning which could make
judicial discretion (a thing perilous at best) deserving the appellation
of a _sound_ discretion.

it is [[curious]] to observe, that the administrative bodies [[body]] are carefully
exempted from the jurisdiction of these new tribunals. that is, those
persons are exempted from the [[power]] of the laws [[law]] who ought to be the most
entirely submitted to them. those who execute [[public]] pecuniary trusts
ought of all [[men]] to be the most strictly held to their [[duty]]. one would
have [[thought]] that it must have been among your earliest cares [[care]], if you
did not mean that those administrative bodies [[body]] should be real, [[sovereign]],
independent states, to form an awful tribunal, like your late
parliaments, or like our king's bench, where all corporate officers
might obtain protection in the legal exercise of their functions, and
would find coercion, if they trespassed against their legal [[duty]]. but
the cause of the exemption is plain. these administrative bodies [[body]] are the
great instruments of the [[present]] leaders in their [[progress]] through
democracy to [[oligarchy]]. they must therefore be put above the [[law]]. it
will be said that the legal tribunals which you have made are unfit to
coerce them. they are, undoubtedly. they are unfit for any rational
purpose. it will be said, too, that the administrative bodies [[body]] will be
accountable to the general assembly. this, i [[fear]], is talking without
much consideration of the [[nature]] of that assembly or of these
corporations. however, to be [[subject]] to the [[pleasure]] of that assembly is
not to be [[subject]] to [[law]], either for protection or for constraint.

this establishment of judges [[judge]] as yet wants something to its completion.
it is to be crowned by a new tribunal. this is to be a grand state
judicature; and it is to [[judge]] of crimes committed against the nation,
that is, against the [[power]] of the assembly. it seems as if they had
something in their view of the [[nature]] of the high court of justice
erected in [[england]] during the [[time]] of the [[great]] usurpation. as they have
not yet finished this part of the scheme, it is impossible to form a
direct [[judgment]] upon it. however, if [[great]] [[care]] is not taken to form it
in a spirit very different from that which has guided them in their
proceedings relative to [[state]] offences, this tribunal, subservient to
their inquisition, _the committee of research_, will extinguish the last
sparks of [[liberty]] in [[france]], and settle the most dreadful and arbitrary
tyranny ever known in any nation. if they [[wish]] to give to this tribunal
any appearance of [[liberty]] and [[justice]], they must not evoke from or send
to it the causes relative to their own members, at their [[pleasure]]. they
must also remove the seat of that tribunal out of the [[republic]] of
paris.[126]

has more [[wisdom]] been displayed in the [[constitution]] of your [[army]] than
what is discoverable in your plan of judicature? the able arrangement of
this part is the more difficult, and requires the greater [[skill]] and
attention, not only as a [[great]] concern in itself, but as it is the third
cementing [[principle]] in the new [[body]] of republics [[republic]] which you call the
french nation. truly, it is not easy to [[divine]] what that [[army]] may become
at [[last]]. you have voted a very large one, and on [[good]] appointments, at
least fully [[equal]] to your apparent means of payment. but what is the
principle of its discipline? or whom is it to obey? you have got the
wolf by the ears, and i [[wish]] you joy of the [[happy]] position in which you
have chosen to place yourselves, and in which you are well circumstanced
for a [[free]] deliberation relatively to that [[army]], or to anything else.

the minister and secretary of [[state]] for the [[war]] department is m. de la
tour du pin. this gentleman, like his colleagues in administration, is a
most zealous assertor of the [[revolution]], and a sanguine admirer of the
new [[constitution]] which originated in that event. his statement of facts
relative to the [[military]] of [[france]] is important, not only from his
official and personal [[authority]], but because it displays very clearly
the actual condition of the [[army]] in [[france]], and because it throws light
on the principles [[principle]] upon which the assembly proceeds in the administration
of this critical object. it may enable us to form some [[judgment]] how far
it may be expedient in this [[country]] to imitate the martial policy of
france.

m. de la tour du pin, on the fourth of [[last]] june, comes to give an
account of the [[state]] of his department, as it exists under the auspices
of the national assembly. no [[man]] knows [[know]] it so well; no [[man]] can express it
better. addressing himself to the national assembly, he says,--

"his majesty has _this day_ sent me to apprise you of the multiplied
disorders of which _every day_ he receives the most distressing
intelligence. the [[army]] [_le corps militaire_] threatens to fall into the
most turbulent [[anarchy]]. entire regiments have dared to violate at once
the [[respect]] due to the laws [[law]], to the [[king]], to the order established by
your decrees, and to the oaths which they have taken with the most awful
solemnity. compelled by my [[duty]] to give you information of these
excesses, my [[heart]] bleeds, when i consider who they are that have
committed them. those against whom it is not in my [[power]] to withhold the
most grievous complaints are a part of that very soldiery which to this
day have been so full of [[honor]] and loyalty, and with whom for fifty
years i have lived the comrade and the friend.

"what incomprehensible spirit of delirium and delusion has all at once
led them astray? whilst you are indefatigable in establishing uniformity
in the [[empire]] and moulding the whole into one coherent and consistent
body, whilst the french are taught by you at once the [[respect]] which the
laws owe to the rights [[right]] of [[man]] and that which the [[citizens]] owe to the
laws, the administration of the [[army]] presents [[present]] nothing but disturbance
and confusion. i see in more than one corps the bonds of discipline
relaxed or broken,--the most unheard-of pretensions avowed directly and
without any [[disguise]],--the ordinances without [[force]],--the chiefs [[chief]] without
authority,--the [[military]] chest and the colors carried off,--the
authority of the [[king]] himself [_risum teneatis_] proudly defied,--the
officers despised, degraded, threatened, driven away, and some of them
prisoners in the midst of their corps, dragging on a precarious [[life]] in
the bosom of disgust and humiliation. to fill up the measure of all
these horrors, the commandants of places have had their throats out
under the [[eyes]] and almost in the arms of their own soldiers.

"these evils [[evil]] are [[great]]; but they are not the worst consequences which
may be produced by such [[military]] insurrections. sooner or later they may
menace the nation itself. _the [[nature]] of things requires_ that the army
should never act but as _an instrument_. the moment that, erecting
itself into a deliberate [[body]], it shall act according to its own
resolutions, _the [[government]], be it what it may, will immediately
degenerate into a [[military]] democracy_: a [[species]] of [[political]] monster
which has always ended by devouring those who have produced it.

"after all this, who must not be alarmed at the irregular consultations
and turbulent committees formed in some regiments by the [[common]] soldiers
and non-commissioned officers, without the [[knowledge]], or even in
contempt of the [[authority]], of their superiors?--although the presence
and concurrence of those superiors could give no [[authority]] to such
monstrous democratic assemblies [_comices_]."

it is not necessary to add much to this finished picture,--finished as
far as its canvas admits, but, as i apprehend, not taking in the whole
of the [[nature]] and complexity of the disorders of this military
democracy, which, the minister at [[war]] truly and wisely observes,
wherever it exists, must be the true [[constitution]] of the [[state]], by
whatever formal appellation it may pass. for, though he informs the
assembly that the more considerable part of the [[army]] have not cast off
their [[obedience]], but are still attached to their [[duty]], yet those
travellers who have seen the corps whose conduct is the [[best]] rather
observe in them the absence of mutiny than the existence of discipline.

i cannot [[help]] pausing here for a moment, to reflect upon the expressions
of surprise which this minister has let fall relative to the excesses he
relates. to him the departure of the [[troops]] from their ancient
principles of loyalty and [[honor]] seems quite inconceivable. surely those
to whom he addresses himself [[know]] the causes of it but too well. they
know the doctrines which they have preached, the decrees which they have
passed, the practices which they have countenanced. the soldiers
remember the sixth of october. they recollect the french guards. they
have not forgot the taking of the king's castles in [[paris]] and at
marseilles. that the governors in both places were murdered with
impunity is a [[fact]] that has not passed out of their minds [[mind]]. they do not
abandon the principles [[principle]], laid down so ostentatiously and laboriously, of
the equality of [[men]]. they cannot shut their [[eyes]] to the degradation of
the whole noblesse of [[france]], and the suppression of the very [[idea]] of a
gentleman. the total abolition of titles and distinctions is not lost
upon them. but m. du pin is astonished at their disloyalty, when the
doctors of the assembly have taught them at the same [[time]] the respect
due to laws [[law]]. it is easy to [[judge]] which of the two sorts of lessons men
with arms in their hands are likely to learn. as to the [[authority]] of the
king, we may collect from the minister himself (if any argument on that
head were not quite superfluous) that it is not of more consideration
with these [[troops]] than it is with everybody else. "the [[king]]," says he,
"has over and over again repeated his orders to put a stop to these
excesses; but in so terrible a crisis, _your_ [the assembly's]
concurrence is become indispensably necessary to prevent the evils [[evil]] which
menace the [[state]]. _you_ unite to the [[force]] of the legislative power
_that of opinion_, still more important." to be sure, the [[army]] can have
no [[opinion]] of the [[power]] or [[authority]] of the [[king]]. perhaps the soldier
has by this [[time]] learned, that the assembly itself does not enjoy a much
greater [[degree]] of [[liberty]] than that [[royal]] figure.

it is now to be seen what has been proposed in this exigency, one of the
greatest that can happen in a [[state]]. the minister requests the assembly
to array itself in all its terrors, and to call forth all its majesty.
he desires [[desire]] that the grave and severe principles [[principle]] announced by them may
give vigor to the king's proclamation. after this we should have looked
for courts civil and martial, breaking of some corps, decimating of
others, and all the terrible means which necessity has employed in such
cases to arrest the [[progress]] of the most terrible of all evils [[evil]];
particularly, one might expect that a serious inquiry would be made into
the murder of commandants in the view of their soldiers. not one word of
all this, or of anything like it. after they had been told that the
soldiery trampled upon the decrees of the assembly promulgated by the
king, the assembly pass new decrees, and they authorize the [[king]] to make
new proclamations. after the secretary at [[war]] had stated that the
regiments had paid no regard to oaths, _prêtés avec la plus imposante
solennité_, they propose--what? more oaths. they renew decrees and
proclamations as they [[experience]] their insufficiency, and they multiply
oaths in proportion as they weaken in the minds [[mind]] of [[men]] the sanctions of
religion. i [[hope]] that handy abridgments of the excellent sermons of
voltaire, d'alembert, diderot, and helvétius, on the immortality of the
soul, on a particular superintending providence, and on a future state
of rewards [[reward]] and punishments [[punishment]], are sent down to the soldiers along with
their civic oaths. of this i have no [[doubt]]; as i [[understand]] that a
certain description of reading makes no inconsiderable part of their
military exercises, and that they are full as well supplied with the
ammunition of pamphlets as of cartridges.

to prevent the mischiefs arising from conspiracies, irregular
consultations, seditious committees, and monstrous democratic assemblies
[_comitia, comices_] of the soldiers, and all the disorders arising from
idleness, luxury, dissipation, and insubordination, i [[believe]] the most
astonishing means have been used that ever occurred to [[men]], even in all
the inventions of this prolific [[age]]. it is no less than this:--the king
has promulgated in circular letters to all the regiments his direct
authority and encouragement, that the several corps should join
themselves with the clubs and confederations in the several
municipalities, and mix with them in their feasts and civic
entertainments! this jolly discipline, it seems, is to soften the
ferocity of their minds [[mind]], to reconcile them to their bottle companions of
other descriptions, and to merge particular conspiracies in more general
associations.[127] that this remedy would be pleasing to the soldiers,
as they are described by m. de la tour du pin, i can readily
believe,--and that, however mutinous otherwise, they will dutifully
submit themselves to _these_ [[royal]] proclamations. but i should question
whether all this civic swearing, clubbing, and feasting would dispose
them, more than at [[present]] they are disposed, to an [[obedience]] to their
officers, or [[teach]] them [[better]] to submit to the austere rules [[rule]] of
military discipline. it will make them admirable [[citizens]] after the
french mode, but not quite so [[good]] soldiers after any mode. a doubt
might well arise, whether the conversations at these [[good]] tables would
fit them a [[great]] deal the [[better]] for the [[character]] of _mere
instruments_, which this veteran officer and statesman justly observes
the [[nature]] of things always requires an [[army]] to be.

concerning the likelihood of this improvement in discipline by the free
conversation of the soldiers with the municipal festive societies [[society]], which
is thus officially encouraged by [[royal]] [[authority]] and sanction, we may
judge by the [[state]] of the municipalities themselves, furnished to us by
the [[war]] minister in this very [[speech]]. he conceives [[good]] hopes [[hope]] of the
success of his endeavors towards restoring order _for the present_ from
the [[good]] disposition of [[certain]] regiments; but he finds something cloudy
with regard to the future. as to preventing the return of confusion,
"for this the administration" (says he) "cannot be answerable to you, as
long as they see the municipalities arrogate to themselves an authority
over the [[troops]] which your [[institutions]] have reserved wholly to the
monarch. you have fixed the limits of the [[military]] [[authority]] and the
municipal [[authority]]. you have bounded the action which you have
permitted to the latter over the former to the [[right]] of requisition; but
never did the letter or the spirit of your decrees authorize the commons
in these municipalities to break the officers, to try them, to give
orders to the soldiers, to drive them from the posts committed to their
guard, to stop them in their marches ordered by the [[king]], or, in a word,
to enslave the [[troops]] to the caprice of each of the cities [[city]] or even
market-towns through which they are to pass."

such is the [[character]] and disposition of the municipal [[society]] which is
to reclaim the soldiery, to bring them back to the true principles [[principle]] of
military subordination, and to lender them machines in the hands of the
supreme [[power]] of the country! such are the distempers of the french
troops! such is their cure! as the [[army]] is, so is the navy. the
municipalities supersede the orders of the assembly, and the seamen in
their turn supersede the orders of the municipalities. from my [[heart]] i
pity the condition of a respectable servant of the [[public]], like this war
minister, obliged in his old [[age]] to pledge the assembly in their civic
cups, and to enter with a hoary head into all the fantastic vagaries of
these juvenile politicians. such schemes are not like propositions
coming from a [[man]] of fifty years' wear and tear amongst [[mankind]]. they
seem rather such as ought to be expected from those grand compounders in
politics who shorten the road to their degrees [[degree]] in the [[state]], and have a
certain inward fanatical assurance and illumination upon all
subjects,--upon the credit of which, one of their doctors has thought
fit, with [[great]] applause, and greater [[success]], to caution the assembly
not to attend to old [[men]], or to any persons [[person]] who value themselves upon
their [[experience]]. i suppose all the ministers of [[state]] must qualify, and
take this test,--wholly abjuring the errors and heresies of experience
and observation. every [[man]] has his own relish; but i [[think]], if i could
not attain to the [[wisdom]], i would at least preserve something of the
stiff and peremptory [[dignity]] of [[age]]. these gentlemen deal in
regeneration: but at any price i should hardly yield my rigid fibres to
be regenerated by them,--nor begin, in my grand climacteric, to squall
in their new accents, or to stammer, in my second cradle, the elemental
sounds of their barbarous metaphysics.[128] _si isti mihi largiantur ut
repuerascam, et in eorum cunis vagiam, valde recusem!_

the imbecility of any part of the puerile and pedantic [[system]] which they
call a [[constitution]] cannot be laid open without discovering the utter
insufficiency and mischief of every other part with which it comes in
contact, or that bears any the remotest relation to it. you cannot
propose a remedy for the incompetence of the [[crown]], without displaying
the debility of the assembly. you cannot deliberate on the confusion of
the [[army]] of the [[state]], without disclosing the worse disorders of the
armed municipalities. the [[military]] lays open the civil, and the civil
betrays the [[military]] [[anarchy]]. i [[wish]] everybody carefully to peruse the
eloquent [[speech]] (such it is) of mons. de la tour du pin. he attributes
the salvation of the municipalities to the [[good]] behavior of some of the
troops. these [[troops]] are to preserve the well-disposed part of the
municipalities, which is confessed to be the weakest, from the pillage
of the worst disposed, which is the strongest. but the municipalities
affect a sovereignty, and will command those [[troops]] which are necessary
for their protection. indeed, they must command them or court them. the
municipalities, by the necessity of their situation, and by the
republican powers [[power]] they have obtained, must, with relation to the
military, be the masters, or the servants, or the confederates, or each
successively, or they must make a jumble of all together, according to
circumstances. what [[government]] is there to coerce the [[army]] but the
municipality, or the municipality but the [[army]]? to preserve concord
where [[authority]] is extinguished, at the hazard of all consequences, the
assembly attempts to cure the distempers by the distempers themselves;
and they [[hope]] to preserve themselves from a purely [[military]] [[democracy]] by
giving it a debauched interest in the municipal.

if the soldiers once come to mix for any [[time]] in the municipal clubs,
cabals, and confederacies, an elective attraction will draw them to the
lowest and most desperate part. with them will be their habits,
affections, and sympathies. the [[military]] conspiracies which are to be
remedied by civic confederacies, the rebellious municipalities which are
to be rendered [[obedient]] by furnishing them with the means of seducing
the very armies [[army]] of the [[state]] that are to keep them in order,--all these
chimeras of a monstrous and portentous policy must aggravate the
confusion from which they have arisen. there must be [[blood]]. the want of
common [[judgment]] manifested in the construction of all their descriptions
of forces [[force]], and in all their kinds [[kind]] of civil and judicial authorities [[authority]],
will make it flow. disorders may be quieted in one [[time]] and in one
part. they will break out in others; because the [[evil]] is radical and
intrinsic. all these schemes of mixing mutinous soldiers with seditious
citizens must weaken still more and more the [[military]] connection of
soldiers with their officers, as well as add [[military]] and mutinous
audacity to turbulent artificers and peasants. to secure a real [[army]],
the officer should be first and [[last]] in the eye of the soldier,--first
and [[last]] in his attention, observance, and esteem. officers, it seems,
there are to be, whose [[chief]] qualification must be temper and patience.
they are to manage their [[troops]] by electioneering [[arts]]. they must bear
themselves as candidates, not as commanders. but as by such means power
may be occasionally in their hands, the [[authority]] by which they are to
be nominated becomes of high importance.

what you may do finally does not appear: nor is it of much moment,
whilst the [[strange]] and contradictory relation between your [[army]] and all
the parts of your [[republic]], as well as the puzzled relation of those
parts to each other and to the whole, remain as they are. you seem to
have given the provisional nomination of the officers, in the first
instance, to the [[king]], with a reserve of approbation by the national
assembly. [[men]] who have an interest to pursue are extremely sagacious in
discovering the true seat of [[power]]. they must soon perceive that those
who can negative indefinitely in reality appoint. the officers must
therefore look to their intrigues in the assembly as the sole certain
road to promotion. still, however, by your new [[constitution]], they must
begin their solicitation at court. this double negotiation for military
rank seems to me a contrivance, as well adapted as if it were studied
for no other end, to promote faction in the assembly itself relative to
this vast [[military]] patronage,--and then to poison the corps of officers
with factions of a [[nature]] still more dangerous to the safety of
government, upon any bottom on which it can be placed, and destructive
in the end to the efficacy of the [[army]] itself. those officers who lose
the promotions intended for them by the [[crown]] must become of a faction
opposite to that of the assembly which has rejected their claims, and
must nourish discontents in the [[heart]] of the [[army]] against the ruling
powers. those officers, on the other hand, who, by carrying their point
through an interest in the assembly, [[feel]] themselves to be at [[best]] only
second in the good-will of the [[crown]], though first in that of the
assembly, must slight an [[authority]] which would not advance and could not
retard their promotion. if, to avoid these evils [[evil]], you will have no other
rule for command or promotion than seniority, you will have an [[army]] of
formality; at the same [[time]] it will become more independent and more of
a [[military]] [[republic]]. not they, but the [[king]] is the machine. a [[king]] is
not to be deposed by halves. if he is not everything in the command of
an [[army]], he is nothing. what is the effect of a [[power]] placed nominally
at the head of the [[army]], who to that [[army]] is no object of gratitude or
of [[fear]]? such a cipher is not fit for the administration of an object of
all things the most delicate, the supreme command of [[military]] [[men]]. they
must be constrained (and their inclinations lead them to what their
necessities require) by a real, vigorous, effective, decided, personal
authority. the [[authority]] of the assembly itself suffers by passing
through such a debilitating channel as they have chosen. the [[army]] will
not long look to an assembly acting through the organ of false show and
palpable imposition. they will not seriously yield [[obedience]] to a
prisoner. they will either despise a pageant, or they will [[pity]] a
captive [[king]]. this relation of your [[army]] to the [[crown]] will, if i am not
greatly mistaken, become a serious dilemma in your [[politics]].

it is besides to be considered, whether an assembly like yours, even
supposing that it was in possession of another sort of organ, through
which its orders were to pass, is fit for promoting the [[obedience]] and
discipline of an [[army]]. it is known that armies [[army]] have hitherto yielded a
very precarious and uncertain [[obedience]] to any senate or popular
authority; and they will least of all yield it to an assembly which is
to have only a continuance of two years. the officers must totally lose
the characteristic disposition of [[military]] [[men]], if they see with perfect
submission and due admiration the dominion of pleaders,--especially when
they find that they have a new court to [[pay]] to an endless succession of
those pleaders, whose [[military]] policy, and the genius of whose command,
(if they should have any,) must be as uncertain as their duration is
transient. in the weakness of one [[kind]] of [[authority]], and in the
fluctuation of all, the officers of an [[army]] will remain for some time
mutinous and full of faction, until some popular general, who
understands the art [[arts]] of conciliating the soldiery, and who possesses the
true spirit of command, shall draw the [[eyes]] of all [[men]] upon himself.
armies will obey him on his personal account. there is no other way of
securing [[military]] [[obedience]] in this [[state]] of things. but the moment in
which that event shall happen, the [[person]] who really commands the army
is your master,--the master (that is little) of your [[king]], the master of
your assembly, the master of your whole [[republic]].

how came the assembly by their [[present]] [[power]] over the [[army]]? chiefly, to
be sure, by debauching the soldiers from their officers. they have begun
by a most terrible operation. they have touched the central point about
which the particles that compose armies [[army]] are at repose. they have
destroyed the [[principle]] of [[obedience]] in the [[great]], essential, critical
link between the officer and the soldier, just where the chain of
military subordination commences, and on which the whole of that [[system]],
depends. the soldier is told he is a citizen, and has the rights [[right]] of man
and citizen. the [[right]] of a [[man]], he is told, is, to be his own governor,
and to be ruled only by those to whom he delegates that self-government.
it is very [[natural]] he should [[think]] that he ought most of all to have his
choice where he is to yield the [[greatest]] [[degree]] of [[obedience]]. he will
therefore, in all probability, systematically do what he does at present
occasionally: that is, he will exercise at least a negative in the
choice of his officers. at [[present]] the officers are known at [[best]] to be
only permissive, and on their [[good]] behavior. in [[fact]], there have been
many instances in which they have been cashiered by their corps. here is
a second negative on the [[choice]] of the [[king]]: a negative as effectual, at
least, as the other of the assembly. the soldiers [[know]] already that it
has been a [[question]], not ill received in the national assembly, whether
they ought not to have the direct [[choice]] of their officers, or some
proportion of them. when such matters are in deliberation, it is no
extravagant supposition that they will incline to the [[opinion]] most
favorable to their pretensions. they will not bear to be deemed the army
of an imprisoned [[king]], whilst another [[army]] in the same [[country]], with
whom too they are to feast and confederate, is to be considered as the
free [[army]] of a [[free]] [[constitution]]. they will cast their [[eyes]] on the other
and more permanent [[army]]: i mean the municipal. that corps, they well
know, does actually elect its own officers. they may not be able to
discern the grounds of distinction on which they are not to elect a
marquis de la fayette (or what is his new name?) of their own. if this
election of a commander-in-chief be a part of the rights [[right]] of [[men]], why not
of theirs? they see elective justices of [[peace]], elective judges [[judge]],
elective curates, elective bishops, elective municipalities, and
elective commanders of the parisian [[army]]. why should they alone be
excluded? are the brave [[troops]] of [[france]] the only [[men]] in that nation who
are not the fit judges [[judge]] of [[military]] [[merit]], and of the qualifications
necessary for a commander-in-chief? are they paid by the [[state]], and do
they therefore lose the rights [[right]] of [[men]]? they are a part of that nation
themselves, and contribute to that [[pay]]. and is not the [[king]], is not the
national assembly, and are not all who elect the national assembly,
likewise paid? instead of seeing all these forfeit their rights [[right]] by their
receiving a salary, they perceive that in all these cases a salary is
given for the exercise of those rights [[right]]. all your resolutions, all your
proceedings, all your debates, all the works [[work]] of your doctors in religion
and [[politics]], have industriously been put into their hands; and you
expect that they will apply to their own case just as much of your
doctrines and examples [[example]] as suits your [[pleasure]].

everything depends upon the [[army]] in such a [[government]] as yours; for you
have industriously destroyed all the opinions [[opinion]] and prejudices, and, as
far as in you lay, all the instincts which support [[government]]. therefore
the moment any difference arises between your national assembly and any
part of the nation, you must have recourse to [[force]]. nothing else is
left to you,--or rather, you have left nothing else to yourselves. you
see, by the report of your [[war]] minister, that the distribution of the
army is in a [[great]] measure made with a view of internal coercion.[129]
you must [[rule]] by an [[army]]; and you have infused into that [[army]] by which
you [[rule]], as well as into the whole [[body]] of the nation, principles [[principle]] which
after a [[time]] must disable you in the use you resolve to make of it. the
king is to call out [[troops]] to act against his [[people]], when the [[world]] has
been told, and the assertion is still ringing in our ears, that troops
ought not to [[fire]] on [[citizens]]. the colonies assert to themselves an
independent [[constitution]] and a [[free]] [[trade]]. they must be constrained by
troops. in what [[chapter]] of your code of the rights [[right]] of [[men]] are they able
to [[read]] that it is a part of the rights [[right]] of [[men]] to have their commerce
monopolized and restrained for the benefit of others? as the colonists
rise on you, the negroes rise on them. [[troops]] again,--massacre, torture,
hanging! these are your rights [[right]] of men! these are the fruits of
metaphysic declarations wantonly made and shamefully retracted! it was
but the other day that the farmers [[farmer]] of [[land]] in one of your provinces
refused to [[pay]] some sorts of rents to the [[lord]] of the soil. in
consequence of this, you decree that the country-people shall [[pay]] all
rents and dues, except those which as grievances you have abolished; and
if they refuse, then you order the [[king]] to march [[troops]] against them.
you lay down metaphysic propositions which infer universal consequences,
and then you attempt to limit [[logic]] by despotism. the leaders of the
present [[system]] tell them of their rights [[right]], as [[men]], to take fortresses, to
murder guards, to seize on kings [[king]] without the least appearance of
authority even from the assembly, whilst, as the [[sovereign]] legislative
body, that assembly was sitting in the name of the nation; and yet these
leaders presume to order out the [[troops]] which have acted in these very
disorders, to coerce those who shall [[judge]] on the principles [[principle]] and follow
the examples [[example]] which have been guarantied by their own approbation.

the leaders [[teach]] the [[people]] to abhor and reject all feodality as the
barbarism of [[tyranny]]; and they tell them afterwards how much of that
barbarous [[tyranny]] they are to bear with patience. as they are prodigal
of [[light]] with regard to grievances, so the [[people]] find them sparing in
the extreme with regard to redress. they [[know]] that not only certain
quit-rents and personal duties [[duty]], which you have permitted them to redeem,
(but have furnished no [[money]] for the redemption,) are as nothing to
those burdens for which you have made no provision at all; they know
that almost the whole [[system]] of landed [[property]] in its origin is
feudal,--that it is the distribution of the possessions of the original
proprietors made by a barbarous conqueror to his barbarous
instruments,--and that the most grievous effects of the [[conquest]] axe the
land-rents of every [[kind]], as without [[question]] they are.

the peasants, in all probability, are the descendants of these ancient
proprietors, romans or gauls. but if they fail, in any [[degree]], in the
titles which they make on the principles [[principle]] of antiquaries and lawyers,
they retreat into the citadel of the rights [[right]] of [[men]]. there they find that
men are [[equal]]; and the [[earth]], the [[kind]] and [[equal]] [[mother]] of all, ought
not to be monopolized to foster the [[pride]] and luxury of any [[men]], who by
nature are no [[better]] than themselves, and who, if they do not labor for
their bread, are worse. they find, that, by the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], the
occupant and subduer of the soil is the true proprietor,--that there is
no prescription against [[nature]],--and that the agreements (where any
there are) which have been made with the landlords during the [[time]] of
slavery are only the effect of duresse and [[force]],--and that, when the
people reëntered into the rights [[right]] of [[men]], those agreements were made as
void as everything else which had been settled under the prevalence of
the old feudal and aristocratic [[tyranny]]. they will tell you that they
see no difference between an idler with a hat and a national cockade and
an idler in a cowl or in a rochet. if you ground the title to rents on
succession and prescription, they tell you from the [[speech]] of m. camus,
published by the national assembly for their information, that things
ill begun cannot avail themselves of prescription,--that the title of
those lords [[lord]] was vicious in its origin,--and that [[force]] is at least as
bad as fraud. as to the title by succession, they will tell you that the
succession of those who have cultivated the soil is the true pedigree of
property, and not rotten parchments and silly substitutions,--that the
lords have enjoyed their usurpation too long,--and that, if they allow
to these lay monks any charitable pension, they ought to be thankful to
the bounty of the true proprietor, who is so generous towards a false
claimant to his goods [[good]].

when the peasants give you back that coin of sophistic [[reason]] on which
you have set your image and superscription, you cry it down as base
money, and tell them you will [[pay]] for the future with french guards and
dragoons and hussars. you hold up, to chastise them, the second-hand
authority of a [[king]], who is only the instrument of destroying, without
any [[power]] of protecting either the [[people]] or his own [[person]]. through
him, it seems, you will make yourselves obeyed. they [[answer]],--"you have
taught us that there are no gentlemen; and which of your principles
teach us to bow to kings [[king]] whom we have not elected? we [[know]], without your
teaching, that lands [[land]] were given for the support of feudal dignities,
feudal titles, and feudal offices. when you took down the cause as a
grievance, why should the more grievous effect remain? as there are now
no hereditary honors and no distinguished families [[family]], why are we taxed to
maintain what you tell us ought not to [[exist]]? you have sent down our old
aristocratic landlords in no other [[character]] and with no other title but
that of exactors under your [[authority]]. have you endeavored to make these
your rent-gatherers respectable to us? no. you have sent them to us with
their arms reversed, their shields broken, their impresses defaced,--and
so displumed, degraded, and metamorphosed, such unfeathered two-legged
things, that we no longer [[know]] them. they are strangers to us. they do
not even go by the names of our ancient lords [[lord]]. physically they may be
the same [[men]],--though we are not quite sure of that, on your new
philosophic doctrines of personal identity. in all other respects [[respect]] they
are totally changed. we do not see why we have not as [[good]] a [[right]] to
refuse them their rents as you have to abrogate all their honors,
titles, and distinctions. this we have never commissioned you to do; and
it is one instance among many, indeed, of your assumption of undelegated
power. we see the burghers of [[paris]], through their clubs, their mobs,
and their national guards, directing you at their [[pleasure]], and giving
that as [[law]] to you, which, under your [[authority]], is transmitted as law
to us. through you, these burghers dispose of the lives [[life]] and fortunes [[fortune]] of
us all. why should not you attend as much to the desires [[desire]] of the
laborious husbandman with regard to our rent, by which we are affected
in the most serious manner, as you do to the demands of these insolent
burghers relative to distinctions and titles of [[honor]], by which neither
they nor we are affected at all? but we find you [[pay]] more regard to
their fancies than to our necessities. is it among the rights [[right]] of [[man]] to
pay tribute to his equals [[equal]]? before this measure of yours we might have
thought we were not perfectly [[equal]]; we might have entertained some old,
habitual, unmeaning prepossession in favor of those landlords; but we
cannot conceive with what other view than that of destroying all respect
to them you could have made the [[law]] that degrades them. you have
forbidden us to treat them with any of the old formalities of [[respect]];
and now you send [[troops]] to sabre and to bayonet us into a submission to
fear and [[force]] which you did not suffer us to yield to the mild
authority of [[opinion]]."

the ground of some of these arguments is horrid and ridiculous to all
rational ears; but to the politicians of metaphysics, who have opened
schools for sophistry, and made establishments for [[anarchy]], it is solid
and conclusive. it is obvious, that, on a mere consideration of the
right, the leaders in the assembly would not in the least have scrupled
to abrogate the rents along with the titles and [[family]] ensigns. it would
be only to [[follow]] up the [[principle]] of their reasonings, and to complete
the analogy of their conduct. but they had newly possessed themselves of
a [[great]] [[body]] of landed [[property]] by confiscation. they had this commodity
at market; and the market would have been wholly destroyed, if they were
to permit the husbandmen to riot in the speculations with which they so
freely intoxicated themselves. the only security which [[property]] enjoys
in any one of its descriptions is from the interests of their rapacity
with regard to some other. they have left nothing but their own
arbitrary [[pleasure]] to determine what [[property]] is to be protected and
what subverted.

neither have they left any [[principle]] by which any of their
municipalities can be bound to [[obedience]],--or even conscientiously
obliged not to separate from the whole, to become independent, or to
connect itself with some other [[state]]. the [[people]] of lyons, it seems,
have refused lately to [[pay]] taxes. why should they not? what lawful
authority is there left to exact them? the [[king]] imposed some of them.
the old states, methodized by orders, settled the more ancient. they may
say to the assembly,--"who are you, that are not our kings [[king]], nor the
states we have elected, nor sit on the principles [[principle]] on which we have
elected you? and who are we, that, when we see the _gabelles_ which you
have ordered to be paid wholly shaken off, when we see the act of
disobedience afterwards ratified by yourselves, who are we, that we are
not to [[judge]] what taxes we ought or ought not to [[pay]], and are not to
avail ourselves of the same powers [[power]] the validity of which you have
approved in others?" to this the [[answer]] is, "we will send [[troops]]." the
last [[reason]] of kings [[king]] is always the first with your assembly. this
military aid may serve for a [[time]], whilst the impression of the increase
of [[pay]] remains, and the vanity of being umpires in all disputes is
flattered. but this weapon will snap short, unfaithful to the hand that
employs it. the assembly keep a school, where, systematically, and with
unremitting perseverance, they [[teach]] principles [[principle]] and form regulations
destructive to all spirit of subordination, civil and [[military]],--and
then they expect that they shall hold in [[obedience]] an anarchic [[people]] by
an anarchic [[army]].

the municipal [[army]], which, according to their new policy, is to balance
this national [[army]], if considered in itself only, is of a constitution
much more simple, and in every [[respect]] less exceptionable. it is a mere
democratic [[body]], unconnected with the [[crown]] or the [[kingdom]], armed and
trained and officered at the [[pleasure]] of the districts to which the
corps severally belong; and the personal service of the individuals [[individual]] who
compose, or the fine in lieu of personal service, are directed by the
same [[authority]].[130] nothing is more uniform. if, however, considered in
any relation to the [[crown]], to the national assembly, to the public
tribunals, or to the other [[army]], or considered in a view to any
coherence or connection between its parts, it seems a monster, and can
hardly fail to terminate its perplexed movements in some [[great]] national
calamity. it is a worse preservative of a general [[constitution]] than the
systasis of crete, or the confederation of poland, or any other
ill-devised corrective which has yet been imagined, in the necessities
produced by an ill-constructed [[system]] of [[government]].

       *       *       *       *       *

having concluded my few remarks on the [[constitution]] of the supreme
power, the executive, the judicature, the [[military]], and on the
reciprocal relation of all these establishments, i shall say something
of the ability showed by your legislators with regard to the [[revenue]].

in their proceedings relative to this object, if possible, still fewer
traces appear of [[political]] [[judgment]] or financial resource. when the
states met, it seemed to be the [[great]] object to improve the [[system]] of
revenue, to enlarge its collection, to cleanse it of oppression and
vexation, and to establish it on the most solid footing. [[great]] were the
expectations entertained on that head throughout [[europe]]. it was by this
grand arrangement that [[france]] was to stand or fall; and this became, in
my [[opinion]] very properly, the test by which the [[skill]] and [[patriotism]] of
those who ruled in that assembly would be tried. the [[revenue]] of the
state is the [[state]]. in effect, all depends upon it, whether for support
or for reformation. the [[dignity]] of every occupation wholly depends upon
the quantity and the [[kind]] of [[virtue]] that may be exerted in it. as all
great qualities of the [[mind]] which operate in [[public]], and are not merely
suffering and passive, require [[force]] for their display, i had almost
said for their unequivocal existence, the [[revenue]], which is the spring
of all [[power]], becomes in its administration the sphere of every active
virtue. [[public]] [[virtue]], being of a [[nature]] magnificent and splendid,
instituted for [[great]] things, and conversant about [[great]] concerns,
requires abundant scope and room, and cannot spread and grow under
confinement, and in circumstances straitened, narrow, and sordid.
through the [[revenue]] alone the [[body]] [[politic]] can act in its true genius
and [[character]]; and therefore it will display just as much of its
collective [[virtue]], and as much of that [[virtue]] which may characterize
those who move it, and are, as it were, its [[life]] and guiding [[principle]],
as it is possessed of a just [[revenue]]. for from hence not only
magnanimity, and liberality, and beneficence, and fortitude, and
providence, and the tutelary protection of all [[good]] [[arts]] derive their
food, and the [[growth]] of their organs, but continence, and self-denial,
and labor, and vigilance, and frugality, and whatever else there is in
which the [[mind]] shows itself above the appetite, are nowhere more in
their proper element than in the provision and distribution of the
public [[wealth]]. it is therefore not without [[reason]] that the [[science]] of
speculative and practical finance, which must take to its aid so many
auxiliary branches of [[knowledge]], stands high in the estimation not only
of the ordinary sort, but of the wisest and [[best]] [[men]]; and as this
science has grown with the [[progress]] of its object, the [[prosperity]] and
improvement of nations has generally increased with the increase of
their revenues [[revenue]]; and they will both continue to grow and flourish as long
as the balance between what is left to strengthen the efforts of
individuals and what is collected for the [[common]] efforts of the state
bear to each other a due reciprocal proportion, and are kept in a close
correspondence and communication. and perhaps it may be owing to the
greatness of revenues [[revenue]], and to the urgency of [[state]] necessities, that old
abuses in the [[constitution]] of finances are discovered, and their true
nature and [[rational]] theory comes to be more perfectly understood;
insomuch that a smaller [[revenue]] might have been more distressing in one
period than a far greater is found to be in another, the proportionate
wealth even remaining the same. in this [[state]] of things, the french
assembly found something in their revenues [[revenue]] to preserve, to secure, and
wisely to administer, as well as to abrogate and alter. though their
proud assumption might justify the severest tests, yet, in trying their
abilities on their financial proceedings, i would only consider what is
the plain, obvious [[duty]] of a [[common]] finance minister, and try them upon
that, and not upon models of ideal [[perfection]].

the objects of a financier are, then, to secure an ample [[revenue]]; to
impose it with [[judgment]] and equality; to employ it economically; and
when necessity obliges him to make use of credit, to secure its
foundations in that instance, and forever, by the clearness and candor
of his proceedings, the exactness of his calculations, and the solidity
of his funds. on these heads we may take a short and distinct view of
the merits [[merit]] and abilities of those in the national assembly who have
taken to themselves the management of this arduous concern.

far from any increase of [[revenue]] in their hands, i find, by a report of
m. vernier, from the committee of finances, of the second of august
last, that the amount of the national [[revenue]], as compared with its
produce before the [[revolution]], was diminished by the sum of two hundred
millions, or _eight millions sterling_, of the annual
income,--considerably more than one third of the whole.

if this be the result of [[great]] ability, never surely was ability
displayed in a more distinguished manner or with so powerful an effect.
no [[common]] folly, no vulgar incapacity, no ordinary official negligence,
even no official crime, no [[corruption]], no peculation, hardly any direct
hostility, which we have seen in the [[modern]] [[world]], could in so short a
time have made so complete an overthrow of the finances, and, with them,
of the [[strength]] of a [[great]] [[kingdom]].--_cedo quî vestram rempublicam
tantam amisistis tam cito?_

the sophisters and declaimers, as soon as the assembly met, began with
decrying the ancient [[constitution]] of the [[revenue]] in many of its most
essential branches, such as the [[public]] [[monopoly]] of salt. they charged
it, as truly as unwisely, with being ill-contrived, oppressive, and
partial. this representation they were not satisfied to make use of in
speeches preliminary to some plan of reform; they declared it in a
solemn resolution or [[public]] sentence, as it were judicially passed upon
it; and this they dispersed throughout the nation. at the [[time]] they
passed the decree, with the same gravity they ordered the same absurd,
oppressive, and partial tax to be paid, until they could find a revenue
to replace it. the consequence was inevitable. the provinces which had
been always exempted from this salt [[monopoly]], some of whom were charged
with other contributions, perhaps equivalent, were totally disinclined
to bear any part of the burden, which by an [[equal]] distribution was to
redeem the others. as to the assembly, occupied as it was with the
declaration and violation of the rights [[right]] of [[men]], and with their
arrangements for general confusion, it had neither leisure nor capacity
to contrive, nor [[authority]] to enforce, any plan of any [[kind]] relative to
the replacing the tax, or equalizing it, or compensating the provinces,
or for conducting their minds [[mind]] to any scheme of accommodation with the
other districts which were to be relieved. the [[people]] of the salt
provinces, impatient under taxes damned by the [[authority]] which had
directed their payment, very soon found their patience exhausted. they
thought themselves as skilful in demolishing as the assembly could be.
they relieved themselves by throwing off the whole burden. animated by
this [[example]], each district, or part of a district, judging of its own
grievance by its own feeling, and of its remedy by its own [[opinion]], did
as it pleased with other taxes.

we are next to see how they have conducted themselves in contriving
equal impositions, proportioned to the means of the [[citizens]], and the
least likely to lean heavy on the active [[capital]] employed in the
generation of that private [[wealth]] from whence the [[public]] [[fortune]] must be
derived. by suffering the several districts, and several of the
individuals in each district, to [[judge]] of what part of the old revenue
they might withhold, instead of [[better]] principles [[principle]] of equality, a new
inequality was introduced of the most oppressive [[kind]]. payments were
regulated by dispositions. the parts of the [[kingdom]] which were the most
submissive, the most orderly, or the most affectionate to the
commonwealth, bore the whole burden of the [[state]]. nothing turns out to
be so oppressive and [[unjust]] as a feeble [[government]]. to fill up all the
deficiencies in the old impositions, and the new deficiencies of every
kind which were to be expected, what remained to a [[state]] without
authority? the national assembly called for a voluntary
benevolence,--for a fourth part of the income of all the [[citizens]], to be
estimated on the [[honor]] of those who were to [[pay]]. they obtained something
more than could be rationally calculated, but what was far indeed from
answerable to their real necessities, and much less to their fond
expectations. [[rational]] [[people]] could have hoped for little from this
their tax in the [[disguise]] of a benevolence,--tax [[weak]], ineffective, and
unequal,--a tax by which luxury, avarice, and selfishness were screened,
and the load thrown upon productive [[capital]], upon integrity, generosity,
and [[public]] spirit,--a tax of regulation upon [[virtue]]. at length the mask
is thrown off, and they are now trying means (with little success) of
exacting their benevolence by [[force]].

this benevolence, the rickety offspring of weakness, was to be supported
by another resource, the twin [[brother]] of the same prolific imbecility.
the patriotic donations were to make [[good]] the failure of the patriotic
contribution. john doe was to become security for richard roe. by this
scheme they took things of much price from the giver, comparatively of
small value to the receiver; they ruined several trades [[trade]]; they pillaged
the [[crown]] of its ornaments, the churches [[church]] of their plate, and the people
of their personal decorations. the invention of those juvenile
pretenders to [[liberty]] was in reality nothing more than a servile
imitation of one of the poorest resources of doting despotism. they took
an old, huge, full-bottomed periwig out of the wardrobe of the
antiquated frippery of louis the fourteenth, to cover the premature
baldness of the national assembly. they produced this old-fashioned
formal folly, though it had been so abundantly exposed in the memoirs of
the duke de saint-simon,--if to reasonable [[men]] it had wanted any
arguments to display its mischief and insufficiency. a device of the
same [[kind]] was tried in my memory by louis the fifteenth, but it answered
at no [[time]]. however, the necessities of ruinous wars [[war]] were some excuse
for desperate projects. the deliberations of calamity are rarely [[wise]].
but here was a season for disposition and providence. it was in a time
of profound [[peace]], then enjoyed for five years, and promising a much
longer continuance, that they had recourse to this desperate trifling.
they were sure to lose more [[reputation]] by sporting, in their serious
situation, with these toys and playthings of finance, which have filled
half their journals, than could possibly be compensated by the poor
temporary supply which they afforded. it seemed as if those who adopted
such projects were wholly ignorant of their circumstances, or wholly
unequal to their necessities. whatever [[virtue]] may be in these devices,
it is obvious that neither the patriotic gifts nor the patriotic
contribution can ever be resorted to again. the resources of public
folly are soon exhausted. the whole, indeed, of their scheme of revenue
is to make, by any artifice, an appearance of a full reservoir for the
hour, whilst at the same [[time]] they cut off the springs and living
fountains of perennial supply. the account not long since furnished by
m. necker was meant, without [[question]], to be favorable. he gives a
flattering view of the means of getting through the year; but he
expresses, as it is [[natural]] he should, some apprehension for that which
was to succeed. on this [[last]] prognostic, instead of entering into the
grounds of this apprehension, in order, by a proper foresight, to
prevent the prognosticated [[evil]], m. necker receives a sort of friendly
reprimand from the president of the assembly.

as to their other schemes of [[taxation]], it is impossible to say anything
of them with certainty, because they have not yet had their operation;
but nobody is so sanguine as to imagine they will fill up any
perceptible part of the wide gaping breach which their incapacity has
made in their revenues [[revenue]]. at [[present]] the [[state]] of their treasury sinks
every day more and more in cash, and swells more and more in fictitious
representation. when so little within or without is now found but paper,
the representative not of opulence, but of want, the creature not of
credit, but of [[power]], they imagine that our flourishing [[state]] in england
is owing to that bank-paper, and not the bank-paper to the flourishing
condition of our commerce, to the solidity of our credit, and to the
total exclusion of all [[idea]] of [[power]] from any part of the transaction.
they forget that in [[england]] not one shilling of paper [[money]] of any
description is received but of [[choice]],--that the whole has had its
origin in cash actually deposited,--and that it is convertible at
pleasure, in an instant, and without the smallest loss, into cash again.
our paper is of value in commerce, because in [[law]] it is of none. it is
powerful on 'change, because in westminster hall it is impotent. in
payment of a debt of twenty shillings a creditor may refuse all the
paper of the bank of [[england]]. nor is there amongst us a [[single]] public
security, of any quality or [[nature]] whatsoever, that is enforced by
authority. in [[fact]], it might be easily shown that our paper [[wealth]],
instead of lessening the real coin, has a tendency to increase
it,--instead of being a substitute for [[money]], it only facilitates its
entry, its exit, and its circulation,--that it is the symbol of
prosperity, and not the badge of distress. never was a scarcity of cash
and an exuberance of paper a [[subject]] of complaint in this nation.

well! but a lessening of prodigal expenses, and the economy which has
been introduced by the [[virtuous]] and sapient assembly, make amends for
the losses sustained in the receipt of [[revenue]]. in this at least they
have fulfilled the [[duty]] of a financier.--have those who say so looked at
the expenses of the national assembly itself? of the municipalities? of
the [[city]] of [[paris]]? of the increased [[pay]] of the two armies [[army]]? of the new
police? of the new judicatures? have they even carefully compared the
present pension-list with the former? these politicians have been cruel,
not economical. comparing the expenses of the former prodigal government
and its relation to the then revenues [[revenue]] with the expenses of this new
system as opposed to the [[state]] of its new treasury, i [[believe]] the
present will be found beyond all comparison more chargeable.[131]

it remains only to consider the proofs of financial ability furnished
by the [[present]] french managers when they are to raise supplies on
credit. here i am a little at a stand; for credit, properly speaking,
they have none. the credit of the ancient [[government]] was not, indeed,
the [[best]]; but they could always, on some terms, command [[money]], not only
at [[home]], but from most of the countries [[country]] of [[europe]] where a surplus
capital was accumulated; and the credit of that [[government]] was improving
daily. the establishment of a [[system]] of [[liberty]] would of course be
supposed to give it new [[strength]]: and so it would actually have done, if
a [[system]] of [[liberty]] had been established. what offers has their
government of pretended [[liberty]] had from holland, from hamburg, from
switzerland, from genoa, from [[england]], for a dealing in their paper? why
should these nations of commerce and economy enter into any pecuniary
dealings with a [[people]] who attempt to reverse the very [[nature]] of
things,--amongst whom they see the debtor prescribing at the point of
the bayonet the medium of his solvency to the creditor, discharging one
of his engagements with another, turning his very penury into his
resource, and paying his interest with his rags?

their fanatical confidence in the omnipotence of [[church]] plunder has
induced these [[philosophers]] to overlook all [[care]] of the [[public]] estate,
just as the [[dream]] of the philosopher's stone induces dupes, under the
more plausible delusion of the hermetic art [[arts]], to neglect all rational
means of improving their fortunes [[fortune]]. with these philosophic financiers,
this universal medicine made of [[church]] mummy is to cure all the evils [[evil]] of
the [[state]]. these gentlemen perhaps do not [[believe]] a [[great]] deal in the
miracles of piety; but it cannot be questioned that they have an
undoubting [[faith]] in the prodigies of sacrilege. is there a debt which
presses them? issue _assignats_. are compensations to be made or a
maintenance decreed to those whom they have robbed of their freehold in
their office or expelled from their profession? _assignats_. is a fleet
to be fitted out? _assignats_. if sixteen millions sterling of these
_assignats_ forced on the [[people]] leave the wants of the [[state]] as urgent
as ever, issue, says one, thirty millions sterling of _assignats_,--says
another, issue fourscore millions more of _assignats_. the only
difference among their financial factions is on the greater or the
lesser quantity of _assignats_ to be imposed on the [[public]] sufferance.
they are all professors of _assignats_. even those whose [[natural]] good
sense and [[knowledge]] of commerce, not obliterated by [[philosophy]], furnish
decisive arguments against this delusion, conclude their arguments by
proposing the emission of _assignats_. i suppose they must talk of
_assignats_, as no other [[language]] would be understood. all [[experience]] of
their inefficacy does not in the least discourage them. are the old
_assignats_ depreciated at market? what is the remedy? issue new
_assignats_.--_mais si maladia opiniatria non vult se garire, quid illi
facere? assignare; postea assignare; ensuita assignare_. the word is a
trifle altered. the latin of your [[present]] doctors may be [[better]] than
that of your old comedy; their [[wisdom]] and the variety of their resources
are the same. they have not more notes in their [[song]] than the cuckoo;
though, far from the softness of that harbinger of summer and plenty,
their voice is as harsh and as ominous as that of the raven.

who but the most desperate adventurers in [[philosophy]] and finance could
at all have [[thought]] of destroying the settled [[revenue]] of the [[state]], the
sole security for the [[public]] credit, in the [[hope]] of rebuilding it with
the materials of confiscated [[property]]? if, however, an excessive zeal
for the [[state]] should have [[led]] a pious and venerable prelate (by
anticipation a [[father]] of the church[132]) to pillage his own order, and,
for the [[good]] of the [[church]] and [[people]], to take upon himself the place of
grand financier of confiscation and comptroller-general of sacrilege, he
and his coadjutors were, in my [[opinion]], bound to show, by their
subsequent conduct, that they knew something of the office they assumed.
when they had resolved to appropriate to the _fisc_ a [[certain]] portion of
the landed [[property]] of their conquered [[country]], it was their [[business]] to
render their bank a real fund of credit,--as far as such a bank was
capable of becoming so.

to establish a current circulating credit upon any _land-bank_, under
any circumstances whatsoever, has hitherto proved difficult at the very
least. the attempt has commonly ended in bankruptcy. but when the
assembly were [[led]], through a contempt of [[moral]], to a defiance of
economical principles [[principle]], it might at least have been expected that nothing
would be omitted on their part to lessen this difficulty, to prevent
any aggravation of this bankruptcy. it might be expected, that, to
render your land-bank tolerable, every means would be adopted that could
display openness and candor in the statement of the security, everything
which could aid the recovery of the demand. to take things in their most
favorable point of view, your condition was that of a [[man]] of a large
landed estate which he wished to dispose of for the discharge of a debt
and the supply of [[certain]] services. not being able instantly to sell,
you wished to mortgage. what would a [[man]] of [[fair]] intentions and a
commonly clear understanding do in such circumstances? ought he not
first to ascertain the gross value of the estate, the charges of its
management and disposition, the incumbrances perpetual and temporary of
all kinds [[kind]] that affect it,--then, striking a net surplus, to calculate
the just value of the security? when that surplus (the only security to
the creditor) had been clearly ascertained, and properly vested in the
hands of trustees, then he would indicate the parcels to be sold, and
the [[time]] and conditions of sale; after this he would admit the public
creditor, if he chose it, to subscribe his stock into this new fund,--or
he might receive proposals for an _assignat_ from those who would
advance [[money]] to purchase this [[species]] of security. this would be to
proceed like [[men]] of [[business]], methodically and rationally, and on the
only principles [[principle]] of [[public]] and private credit that have an existence. the
dealer would then [[know]] exactly what he purchased; and the only doubt
which could hang upon his [[mind]] would be the dread of the resumption of
the spoil, which one day might be made (perhaps with an addition of
punishment) from the sacrilegious gripe of those execrable wretches who
could become purchasers at the auction of their innocent
fellow-citizens.

an open, and exact statement of the clear value of the [[property]], and of
the [[time]], the circumstances, and the place of sale, were all necessary,
to efface as much as possible the stigma that has hitherto been branded
on every [[kind]] of land-bank. it became necessary on another
principle,--that is, on account of a pledge of [[faith]] previously given on
that [[subject]], that their future fidelity in a slippery concern might be
established by their adherence to their first engagement. when they had
finally determined on a [[state]] resource from [[church]] booty, they came, on
the fourteenth of april, 1790, to a solemn resolution on the [[subject]],
and pledged themselves to their [[country]], "that, in the statement of the
public charges for each year, there should be brought to account a sum
sufficient for defraying the expenses of the r.c.a. [[religion]], the
support of the ministers at the altars, the relief of the [[poor]], the
pensions to the ecclesiastics, secular as well as regular, of the one
and of the other [[sex]], _in order that the estates and goods [[good]] which are at
the disposal of the nation may be disengaged of all charges, and
employed by the representatives, or the legislative [[body]], to the great
and most pressing exigencies of the [[state]]."_ they further engaged, on
the same day, that the sum necessary for the year 1791 should be
forthwith determined.

in this resolution they admit it their [[duty]] to show distinctly the
expense of the above objects, which, by other resolutions, they had
before engaged should be first in the order of provision. they admit
that they ought to show the estate clear and disengaged of all charges,
and that they should show it immediately. have they done this
immediately, or at any [[time]]? have they ever furnished a rent-roll of the
immovable estate, or given in an inventory of the movable effects, which
they confiscate to their assignats? in what manner they can fulfil their
engagements of holding out to [[public]] service "an estate disengaged of
all charges," without authenticating the value of the estate or the
quantum of the charges, i leave it to their english admirers to explain.
instantly upon this assurance, and previously to any one step towards
making it [[good]], they issue, on the credit of so handsome a declaration,
sixteen millions sterling of their paper. this was manly. who, after
this masterly stroke, can [[doubt]] of their abilities in finance?--but
then, before any other emission of these financial _indulgences_, they
took [[care]] at least to make [[good]] their original promise.--if such
estimate, either of the value of the estate or the amount of the
incumbrances, has been made, it has escaped me. i never heard of it.

at length they have spoken out, and they have made a full discovery of
their abominable fraud in holding out the [[church]] lands [[land]] as a security for
any debts or any service whatsoever. they rob only to enable them to
cheat; but in a very short [[time]] they defeat the ends both of the robbery
and the fraud, by making out accounts for other purposes [[purpose]], which blow up
their whole apparatus of [[force]] and of deception. i am obliged to m. de
calonne for his reference to the document which proves this
extraordinary [[fact]]: it had by some means escaped me. indeed, it was not
necessary to make out my assertion as to the breach of [[faith]] on the
declaration of the fourteenth of april, 1790. by a report of their
committee it now appears that the charge of keeping up the reduced
ecclesiastical establishments, and other expenses attendant on [[religion]],
and maintaining the [[religious]] of both sexes [[sex]], retained or pensioned, and
the other concomitant expenses of the same [[nature]], which they have
brought upon themselves by this convulsion in [[property]], exceeds the
income of the estates acquired by it in the enormous sum of two millions
sterling annually,--besides a debt of seven millions and upwards. these
are the calculating powers [[power]] of imposture! this is the finance of
philosophy! this is the result of all the delusions held out to engage a
miserable [[people]] in rebellion, murder, and sacrilege, and to make them
prompt and zealous instruments in the ruin of their country! never did a
state, in any case, enrich itself by the confiscations of the [[citizens]].
this new experiment has succeeded like all the rest. every honest [[mind]],
every true lover of [[liberty]] and [[humanity]], must rejoice to find that
injustice is not always [[good]] policy, nor rapine the high-road to riches [[rich]].
i subjoin with [[pleasure]], in a note, the able and spirited observations
of m. de calonne on this [[subject]].[133]

in order to persuade the [[world]] of the bottomless resource of
ecclesiastical confiscation, the assembly have proceeded to other
confiscations of estates in offices, which could not be done with any
common color without being compensated out of this grand confiscation of
landed [[property]]. they have thrown upon this fund, which was to show a
surplus disengaged of all charges, a new charge, namely, the
compensation to the whole [[body]] of the disbanded judicature, and of all
suppressed offices and estates: a charge which i cannot ascertain, but
which unquestionably amounts to many french millions. another of the new
charges is an annuity of four hundred and eighty thousand pounds
sterling, to be paid (if they choose to keep faith) by daily payments,
for the interest of the first assignats. have they ever given themselves
the trouble to [[state]] fairly the expense of the management of the church
lands in the hands of the municipalities, to whose [[care]], [[skill]], and
diligence, and that of their legion of unknown under-agents, they have
chosen to commit the charge of the forfeited estates, and the
consequence of which had been so ably pointed out by the bishop of
nancy?

but it is unnecessary to dwell on these obvious heads of incumbrance.
have they made out any clear [[state]] of the grand incumbrance of all, i
mean the whole of the general and municipal establishments of all sorts,
and compared it with the regular income by [[revenue]]? every deficiency in
these becomes a charge on the confiscated estate, before the creditor
can plant his cabbages on an acre of [[church]] [[property]]. there is no other
prop than this confiscation to keep the whole [[state]] from tumbling to the
ground. in this situation they have purposely covered all, that they
ought industriously to have cleared, with a thick fog; and then,
blindfold themselves, like bulls that shut their [[eyes]] when they push,
they drive, by the point of the bayonets, their slaves [[slave]], blindfolded
indeed no worse than their lords [[lord]], to take their fictions for currencies,
and to swallow down paper pills by thirty-four millions sterling at a
dose. then they proudly lay in their claim to a future credit, on
failure of all their [[past]] engagements, and at a [[time]] when (if in such a
matter anything can be clear) it is clear that the surplus estates will
never [[answer]] even the first of their mortgages,--i mean that of the four
hundred millions (or sixteen millions sterling) of assignats. in all
this procedure i can discern neither the solid sense of plain dealing
nor the subtle dexterity of ingenious fraud. the objections within the
assembly to pulling up the flood-gates for this inundation of fraud are
unanswered; but they are thoroughly refuted by an hundred thousand
financiers in the street. these are the numbers by which the metaphysic
arithmeticians compute. these are the grand calculations on which a
philosophical [[public]] credit is founded in [[france]]. they cannot raise
supplies; but they can raise mobs. let them rejoice in the applauses of
the club at dundee for their [[wisdom]] and [[patriotism]] in having thus
applied the plunder of the [[citizens]] to the service of the [[state]]. i hear
of no address upon this [[subject]] from the directors of the bank of
england,--though their approbation would be of a _little_ more weight in
the scale of credit than that of the club at dundee. but to do justice
to the club, i [[believe]] the gentlemen who compose it to be wiser than
they appear,--that they will be less liberal of their [[money]] than of
their addresses, and that they would not give a dog's ear of their most
rumpled and ragged scotch paper for twenty of your fairest assignats.

early in this year the assembly issued paper to the amount of sixteen
millions sterling. what must have been the [[state]] into which the assembly
has brought your affairs, that the relief afforded by so vast a supply
has been hardly perceptible? this paper also [[felt]] an almost immediate
depreciation of five per cent, which in a little [[time]] came to about
seven. the effect of these assignats on the receipt of the [[revenue]] is
remarkable. m. necker found that the collectors of the [[revenue]], who
received in coin, paid the treasury in assignats. the collectors made
seven per cent by thus receiving in [[money]], and accounting in depreciated
paper. it was not very difficult to foresee that this must be
inevitable. it was, however, not the less embarrassing. m. necker was
obliged (i [[believe]], for a considerable part, in the market of london) to
buy gold and silver for the mint, which amounted to about twelve
thousand pounds above the value of the commodity gained. that minister
was of [[opinion]], that, whatever their secret nutritive [[virtue]] might be,
the [[state]] could not [[live]] upon assignats alone,--that some real silver
was necessary, particularly for the satisfaction of those who, having
iron in their hands, were not likely to distinguish themselves for
patience, when they should perceive, that, whilst an increase of [[pay]] was
held out to them in real [[money]], it was again to be fraudulently drawn
back by depreciated paper. the minister, in this very [[natural]] distress,
applied to the assembly, that they should order the collectors to [[pay]] in
specie what in specie they had received. it could not escape him, that,
if the treasury paid three per cent for the use of a currency which
should be returned seven per cent worse than the minister issued it,
such a dealing could not very greatly tend to enrich the [[public]]. the
assembly took no notice of his recommendation. they were in this
dilemma: if they continued to receive the assignats, cash must become an
alien to their treasury; if the treasury should refuse those paper
_amulets_, or should discountenance them in any [[degree]], they must
destroy the credit of their sole resource. they seem, then, to have made
their option, and to have given some sort of credit to their paper by
taking it themselves; at the same [[time]], in their speeches [[speech]], they made a
sort of swaggering declaration, something, i rather [[think]], above
legislative competence,--that is, that there is no difference in value
between metallic [[money]] and their assignats. this was a [[good]], stout,
proof article of [[faith]], pronounced under an anathema by the venerable
fathers of this philosophic synod. _credat_ who will,--certainly not
_judæus apella_.

a [[noble]] indignation rises in the minds [[mind]] of your popular leaders, on
hearing the magic-lantern in their show of finance compared to the
fraudulent exhibitions of mr. [[law]]. they cannot bear to hear the sands
of his mississippi compared with the rock of the [[church]], on which they
build their [[system]]. [[pray]] let them suppress this glorious spirit, until
they show to the [[world]] what piece of solid ground there is for their
assignats, which they have not preoccupied by other charges. they do
injustice to that [[great]] [[mother]] fraud, to compare it with their
degenerate imitation. it is not true that [[law]] built solely on a
speculation concerning the mississippi. he added the east [[india]] [[trade]];
he added the african [[trade]]; he added the farms of all the farmed revenue
of [[france]]. all these together unquestionably could not support the
structure which the [[public]] enthusiasm, not he, chose to build upon these
bases. but these were, however, in comparison, generous delusions. they
supposed, and they aimed at, an increase of the commerce of [[france]]. they
opened to it the whole range of the two hemispheres. they did not think
of feeding [[france]] from its own substance. a grand [[imagination]] found in
this flight of commerce something to captivate. it was wherewithal to
dazzle the eye of an eagle. it was not made to entice the smell of a
mole, nuzzling and burying himself in his [[mother]] [[earth]], as yours is. men
were not then quite shrunk from their [[natural]] dimensions by a degrading
and sordid [[philosophy]], and fitted for low and vulgar deceptions. above
all, [[remember]], that, in imposing on the [[imagination]], the then managers
of the [[system]] made a compliment to the [[freedom]] of [[men]]. in their fraud
there was no mixture of [[force]]. this was reserved to our [[time]], to quench
the little glimmerings of [[reason]] which might break in upon the solid
darkness of this enlightened [[age]].

on recollection, i have said nothing of a scheme of finance which may be
urged in favor of the abilities of these gentlemen, and which has been
introduced with [[great]] pomp, though not yet finally adopted in the
national assembly. it comes with something solid in aid of the credit of
the paper circulation; and much has been said of its utility and its
elegance. i mean the project for coining into [[money]] the bells of the
suppressed churches [[church]]. this is their alchemy. there are some follies which
baffle argument, which go beyond ridicule, and which excite no feeling
in us but disgust; and therefore i say no more upon it.

it is as little worth remarking any farther upon all their drawing and
re-drawing, on their circulation for putting off the [[evil]] day, on the
play between the treasury and the _caisse d'escompte_, and on all these
old, exploded contrivances of mercantile fraud, now exalted into policy
of [[state]]. the [[revenue]] will not be trifled with. the prattling about the
rights of [[men]] will not be accepted in payment of a biscuit or a pound of
gunpowder. here, then, the metaphysicians descend from their airy
speculations, and faithfully [[follow]] examples [[example]]. what examples [[example]]? the
examples of bankrupts. but defeated, baffled, disgraced, when their
breath, their [[strength]], their inventions, their fancies desert them,
their confidence still maintains its ground. in the manifest failure of
their abilities, they take credit for their benevolence. when the
revenue disappears in their hands, they have the presumption, in some of
their late proceedings, to value _themselves_ on the relief given to the
people. they did not relieve the [[people]]. if they entertained such
intentions, why did they order the obnoxious taxes to be paid? the
people relieved themselves, in spite of the assembly.

but waiving all discussion on the parties who may claim the [[merit]] of
this fallacious relief, has there been, in effect, any relief to the
people in any form? m. bailly, one of the grand agents of paper
circulation, lets you into the [[nature]] of this relief. his [[speech]] to the
national assembly contained a high and labored panegyric on the
inhabitants of [[paris]], for the constancy and unbroken resolution with
which they have borne their distress and misery. a fine picture of
public felicity! what! [[great]] [[courage]] and unconquerable firmness of mind
to endure benefits and sustain redress? one would [[think]], from the speech
of this learned [[lord]] mayor, that the parisians, for this twelvemonth
past, had been suffering the straits of some dreadful blockade,--that
henry the fourth had been stopping up the avenues to their supply, and
sully thundering with his ordnance at the gates of [[paris]],--when in
reality they are besieged by no other enemies [[enemy]] than their own madness and
folly, their own credulity and perverseness. but m. bailly will sooner
thaw the eternal ice of his atlantic regions than restore the central
heat to [[paris]], whilst it remains "smitten with the cold, dry, petrific
mace" of a false and unfeeling [[philosophy]]. some [[time]] after this [[speech]],
that is, on the thirteenth of [[last]] august, the same magistrate, giving
an account of his [[government]] at the bar of the same assembly, expresses
himself as follows:--"in the month of july, 1789," (the period of
everlasting commemoration,) "the finances of the [[city]] of [[paris]] were
_yet_ in [[good]] order; the expenditure was counterbalanced by the receipt,
and she had at that [[time]] a million [forty thousand pounds sterling] in
bank. the expenses which she has been constrained to incur, _subsequent
to the revolution_, amount to 2,500,000 livres. from these expenses, and
the [[great]] falling off in the product of the _free gifts_, not only a
momentary, but a _total_, want of [[money]] has taken place." this is the
paris upon whose nourishment, in the course of the [[last]] year, such
immense sums, drawn from the vitals of all [[france]], have been expended.
as long as [[paris]] stands in the place of ancient [[rome]], so long she will
be maintained by the [[subject]] provinces. it is an [[evil]] inevitably
attendant on the dominion of [[sovereign]] democratic republics [[republic]]. as it
happened in [[rome]], it may survive that republican domination which gave
rise to it. in that case despotism itself must submit to the vices [[vice]] of
popularity. [[rome]], under her emperors [[emperor]], [[united]] the evils [[evil]] of both systems [[system]];
and this unnatural combination was one [[great]] cause of her ruin.

to tell the [[people]] that they are relieved by the dilapidation of their
public estate is a cruel and insolent imposition. statesmen, before they
valued themselves on the relief given to the [[people]] by the destruction
of their [[revenue]], ought first to have carefully attended to the solution
of this problem:--whether it be more advantageous to the [[people]] to pay
considerably and to gain in proportion, or to gain little or nothing and
to be disburdened of all contribution? my [[mind]] is made up to decide in
favor of the first proposition. [[experience]] is with me, and, i [[believe]],
the [[best]] opinions [[opinion]] also. to keep a balance between the [[power]] of
acquisition on the part of the [[subject]] and the demands he is to answer
on the part of the [[state]] is the fundamental part of the [[skill]] of a true
politician. the means of acquisition are prior in [[time]] and in
arrangement. [[good]] order is the foundation of all [[good]] things. to be
enabled to acquire, the [[people]], without being servile, must be tractable
and [[obedient]]. the magistrate must have his reverence, the laws [[law]] their
authority. the [[body]] of the [[people]] must not find the principles [[principle]] of
natural subordination by art [[arts]] rooted out of their minds [[mind]]. they must
respect that [[property]] of which they cannot partake. they must labor to
obtain what by labor can be obtained; and when they find, as they
commonly do, the [[success]] disproportioned to the endeavor, they must be
taught their consolation in the final proportions of eternal [[justice]]. of
this consolation whoever deprives them deadens their industry, and
strikes at the root of all acquisition as of all conservation. he that
does this is the cruel oppressor, the merciless [[enemy]] of the [[poor]] and
wretched; at the same [[time]] that by his wicked speculations he exposes
the fruits of successful industry and the accumulations of [[fortune]] to
the plunder of the negligent, the disappointed, and the unprosperous.

too many of the financiers by profession are apt to see nothing in
revenue but banks, and circulations, and annuities on lives [[life]], and
tontines, and perpetual rents, and all the small wares of the shop. in a
settled order of the [[state]], these things are not to be slighted, nor is
the [[skill]] in them to be held of trivial estimation. they are [[good]], but
then only [[good]] when they assume the effects of that settled order, and
are built upon it. but when [[men]] [[think]] that these beggarly contrivances
may supply a resource for the evils [[evil]] which result from breaking up the
foundations of [[public]] order, and from causing or suffering the
principles of [[property]] to be subverted, they will, in the ruin of their
country, leave a melancholy and lasting monument of the effect of
preposterous [[politics]], and presumptuous, short-sighted, narrow-minded
wisdom.

the effects of the incapacity shown by the popular leaders in all the
great members of the commonwealth are to be covered with the
"all-atoning name" of [[liberty]]. in some [[people]] i see [[great]] [[liberty]],
indeed; in many, if not in the most, an oppressive, degrading servitude.
but what is [[liberty]] without [[wisdom]] and without [[virtue]]? it is the
greatest of all possible evils [[evil]]; for it is folly, [[vice]], and madness,
without tuition or restraint. those who [[know]] what [[virtuous]] [[liberty]] is
cannot bear to see it disgraced by incapable heads, on account of their
having high-sounding words in their mouths. grand, swelling sentiments
of [[liberty]] i am sure i do not despise. they warm the [[heart]]; they enlarge
and liberalize our minds [[mind]]; they animate our [[courage]] in a [[time]] of
conflict. old as i am, i [[read]] the fine raptures of lucan and corneille
with [[pleasure]]. neither do i wholly condemn the little [[arts]] and devices
of popularity. they facilitate the carrying of many points of moment;
they keep the [[people]] together; they refresh the [[mind]] in its exertions;
and they diffuse occasional gayety over the severe brow of moral
freedom. every politician ought to [[sacrifice]] to the graces, and to join
compliance with [[reason]]. but in such an undertaking as that in [[france]] all
these subsidiary sentiments and artifices are of little avail. to make a
government requires no [[great]] prudence. settle the seat of [[power]], teach
obedience, and the [[work]] is done. to give [[freedom]] is still more easy. it
is not necessary to guide; it only requires to let go the rein. but to
form a _free government_, that is, to temper together these opposite
elements of [[liberty]] and restraint in one consistent [[work]], requires much
thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and combining [[mind]].
this i do not find in those who take the lead in the national assembly.
perhaps they are not so miserably deficient as they appear. i rather
believe it. it would put them below the [[common]] level of human
understanding. but when the leaders choose to make themselves bidders at
an auction of popularity, their [[talents]], in the construction of the
state, will be of no service. they will become flatterers instead of
legislators,--the instruments, not the guides of the [[people]]. if any of
them should happen to propose a scheme of [[liberty]] soberly limited, and
defined with proper qualifications, he will be immediately outbid by his
competitors, who will [[produce]] something more splendidly popular.
suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause. moderation will
be stigmatized as the [[virtue]] of cowards, and compromise as the prudence
of traitors,--until, in hopes [[hope]] of preserving the credit which may enable
him to temper and moderate on some occasions [[occasion]], the popular leader is
obliged to become active in propagating doctrines and establishing
powers that will afterwards defeat any sober [[purpose]] at which he
ultimately might have aimed.

       *       *       *       *       *

but am i so unreasonable as to see nothing at all that deserves
commendation in the indefatigable labors of this assembly? i do not
deny, that, among an infinite number of acts of [[violence]] and folly, some
good may have been done. they who [[destroy]] everything certainly will
remove some grievance. they who make everything new have a [[chance]] that
they may establish something beneficial. to give them credit for what
they have done in [[virtue]] of the [[authority]] they have usurped, or to
excuse them in the crimes by which that [[authority]] has been acquired, it
must appear that the same things could not have been accomplished
without producing such a [[revolution]]. most assuredly they might; because
almost every one of the regulations made by them, which is not very
equivocal, was either in the cession of the [[king]], voluntarily made at
the meeting of the states, or in the concurrent instructions to the
orders. some usages have been abolished on just grounds; but they were
such, that, if they had stood as they were to all eternity, they would
little detract from the [[happiness]] and [[prosperity]] of any [[state]]. the
improvements of the national assembly are superficial, their errors
fundamental.

whatever they are, i [[wish]] my countrymen rather to recommend to our
neighbors the [[example]] of the british [[constitution]] than to take models
from them for the improvement of our own. in the former they have got an
invaluable treasure. they are not, i [[think]], without some causes of
apprehension and complaint; but these they do not owe to their
constitution, but to their own conduct. i [[think]] our [[happy]] situation
owing to our [[constitution]],--but owing to the whole of it, and not to any
part singly,--owing in a [[great]] measure to what we have left standing in
our several reviews and reformations, as well as to what we have altered
or superadded. our [[people]] will find employment enough for a truly
patriotic, [[free]], and independent spirit, in guarding what they possess
from violation. i would not exclude alteration neither; but even when i
changed, it should be to preserve. i should be [[led]] to my remedy by a
great grievance. in what i did, i should [[follow]] the [[example]] of our
ancestors. i would make the reparation as nearly as possible in the
style of the building. a [[politic]] caution, a guarded circumspection, a
moral rather than a complexional timidity, were among the ruling
principles of our forefathers in their most decided conduct. not being
illuminated with the [[light]] of which the gentlemen of [[france]] tell us they
have got so abundant a share, they acted under a [[strong]] impression of
the ignorance and fallibility of [[mankind]]. he that had made them thus
fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct attended to their
nature. let us imitate their caution, if we [[wish]] to deserve their
fortune or to retain their bequests. let us add, if we please, but let
us preserve what they have left; and standing on the firm ground of the
british [[constitution]], let us be satisfied to [[admire]], rather than attempt
to [[follow]] in their desperate flights, the aëronauts of [[france]].

i have told you candidly my sentiments. i [[think]] they are not likely to
alter yours. i do not [[know]] that they ought. you are [[young]]; you cannot
guide, but must [[follow]], the [[fortune]] of your [[country]]. but hereafter they
may be of some use to you, in some future form which your commonwealth
may take. in the [[present]] it can hardly remain; but before its final
settlement, it may be obliged to pass, as one of our poets says,
"through [[great]] varieties of untried being," and in all its
transmigrations to be purified by [[fire]] and [[blood]].

i have little to recommend my opinions [[opinion]] but long observation and much
impartiality. they come from one who has been no tool of [[power]], no
flatterer of greatness, and who in his [[last]] acts does not [[wish]] to belie
the tenor of his [[life]]. they come from one almost the whole of whose
public exertion has been a struggle for the [[liberty]] of others,--from one
in whose breast no anger durable or vehement has ever been kindled but
by what he considered as [[tyranny]], and who snatches from his share in the
endeavors which are used by [[good]] [[men]] to discredit opulent oppression the
hours he has employed on your affairs, and who in so doing persuades
himself he has not departed from his usual office. they come from one
who desires [[desire]] honors, distinctions, and emoluments but little, and who
expects them not at all,--who has no contempt for fame, and no [[fear]] of
obloquy,--who shuns contention, though he will hazard an [[opinion]]; from
one who wishes [[wish]] to preserve consistency, but who would preserve
consistency by varying his means to secure the unity of his end,--and,
when the equipoise of the vessel in which he sails may be endangered by
overloading it upon one side, is desirous of carrying the small weight
of his reasons [[reason]] to that which may preserve its equipoise.

[92] it is proper here to refer to a letter written upon this [[subject]] by
an eyewitness. that eyewitness was one of the most honest, [[intelligent]],
and eloquent members of the national assembly, one of the most active
and zealous reformers of the [[state]]. he was obliged to secede from the
assembly; and he afterwards became a voluntary [[exile]], on account of the
horrors of this pious triumph, and the dispositions of [[men]], who,
profiting of crimes, if not causing them, have taken the lead in public
affairs.

_extract of m. de lally tollendal's second letter to a friend_.

"parlons du parti que j'ai pris; il est bien justifé dans ma
conscience.--ni cette ville coupable, ni cette assemblée plus coupable
encore, ne méritoient que je me justifie; mais j'ai à cœur que vous, et
les personnes qui pensent comme vous, ne me condamnent pas.--ma santé,
je vous jure, me rendoit mes fonctions impossibles; mais même en les
mettant de côté il a été au-dessus de mes forces [[force]] de supporter plus
longtems l'horreur que me causoit ce sang,--ces têtes,--cette reine
_presque egorgée_,--ce roi, amené _esclave_, entrant à [[paris]] au milieu
de ses assassins, et précédé des têtes de ses malheureux gardes,--ces
perfides janissaires, ces assassins, ces femmes cannibales,--ce cri de
tous les évêques à la lanterne, dans le moment où le roi entre sa
capitale avec deux évêques de [[son]] conseil dans sa voiture,--un _coup de
fusil_, que j'ai vu tirer dans un _des carrosses de la reine_,--m.
bailly appellant cela _un beau jour_,--l'assemblée ayant déclaré
froidement le matin, qu'il n'étoit pas de sa dignité d'aller toute
entière environner le roi,--m. mirabeau disant impunément dans cette
assemblée, que le vaisseau de l'état, loin d'être arrêté dans sa course,
s'élanceroit avec plus de rapidité que jamais vers sa régénération,--m.
barnave, riant avec lui, quand des flots de sang couloient autour de
nous,--le vertueux mounier[a] échappant par miracle à vingt assassins,
qui avoient voulu faire de sa tête un trophée de plus: voilà ce qui me
fit jurer de ne plus mettre le pied _dans cette caverne d'antropophages_
[the national assembly], où je n'avois plus de [[force]] d'élever la voix,
où depuis six semaines je l'avois élevée en [[vain]].

"moi, mounier, et tous les honnêtes gens, ont pensé que le dernier
effort à faire pour le bien étoit d'en sortir. aucune idée de crainte ne
s'est approchée de moi. je rougirois de m'en défendre. j'avois encore
reçû sur la route de la part de ce peuple, moins coupable que ceux qui
l'ont enivré de fureur, des acclamations, et des applaudissements, dont
d'autres auroient été flattés, et qui m'ont fait frémir. c'est à
l'indignation, c'est à l'horreur, c'est aux convulsions physiques, que
le seul aspect du sang me fait éprouver que j'ai cédé. on brave une
seule mort; on la brave plusieurs fois, quand elle peut être utile. mais
aucune puissance sous le ciel, mais aucune [[opinion]] publique ou privée
n'ont le droit de me condamner à souffrir inutilement mille supplices
par minute, et à périr de désespoir, de rage, au milieu des _triomphes_,
du crime que je n'ai pu arrêter. ils me proscriront, ils confisqueront
mes biens. je labourerai la terre, et je ne les verrai plus. voilà ma
justification. vous pourrez la lire, la montrer, la laisser copier; tant
pis pour ceux qui ne la comprendront pas; ce ne sera alors moi qui
auroit eu tort de la leur donner."

this [[military]] [[man]] had not so [[good]] nerves as the peaceable gentlemen of
the old jewry.--see mons. mounier's narrative of these transactions: a
man also of [[honor]] and [[virtue]] and [[talents]], and therefore a fugitive.

[a] n.b.m. mounier was then speaker of the national assembly. he has
since been obliged to [[live]] in [[exile]], though one of the firmest assertors
of [[liberty]].

[93] see the [[fate]] of bailly and condorcet, supposed to be here
particularly alluded to. compare the circumstances of the [[trial]] and
execution of the former with this prediction.

[94] the english are, i conceive, misrepresented in a letter published
in one of the papers, by a gentleman [[thought]] to be a dissenting
minister. when writing to dr. price of the spirit which prevails at
paris, he says,--"the spirit of the [[people]] in this place has abolished
all the proud _distinctions_ which the _king_ and _nobles_ had usurped
in their minds [[mind]]: whether they talk of _the [[king]], the [[noble]], or the
priest_, their whole [[language]] is that of the most _enlightened and
liberal amongst the english_." if this gentleman means to confine the
terms _enlightened and liberal_ to one set of [[men]] in [[england]], it may be
true. it is not generally so.

[95] sit igitur hoc ab initio persuasum civibus, dominos esse omnium
rerum ac moderatores deos; eaque, quæ gerantur, eorum geri vi, ditione,
ac numine; eosdemque optime de genere hominum mereri; et qualis quisque

[102] the rest of the passage is this:--

    "who, having spent the treasures of his [[crown]],
    condemns their luxury to feed his own.
    and yet this act, to varnish o'er the shame
    of sacrilege, must bear devotion's name.
    no crime so bold, but would be understood
    a real, or at least a seeming [[good]].
    who fears [[fear]] not to do ill, yet fears [[fear]] the name,
    and [[free]] from [[conscience]], is a [[slave]] to fame.
    thus he the [[church]] at once protects and spoils:
    but princes' swords [[sword]] are sharper than their styles.
    and thus to th' ages [[age]] [[past]] he makes amends,
    their charity destroys, their [[faith]] defends.
    then did [[religion]] in a lazy cell,
    in empty, airy contemplations, dwell;
    and like the block, unmovèd lay: but ours,
    as much too active, like the stork devours.
    is there no temperate region can be known
    betwixt their frigid and our torrid zone?
    could we not wake from that lethargic [[dream]],
    but to be restless in a worse extreme?
    and for that lethargy was there no [[care]],
    but to be cast into a calenture?
    can [[knowledge]] have no bound, but must advance
    so far, to make us [[wish]] for ignorance,
    and rather in the dark to grope our way,
    than, [[led]] by a false guide, to err by day?
    who sees these dismal heaps, but would demand
    what barbarous invader sack'd the [[land]]?
    but when he hears no goth, no turk did bring
    this desolation, but a [[christian]] [[king]],
    when nothing but the name of zeal appears
    'twixt our [[best]] actions and the worst of theirs,
    what does he [[think]] our sacrilege would spare,
    when such th' effects of our devotions are?"

[103] rapport de mons. le directeur-général des finances, fait par ordre
du roi à versailles. mai 5, 1789.

[104] in the [[constitution]] of [[scotland]], during the stuart reigns, a
committee sat for preparing bills; and none could pass, but those
previously approved by them. this committee was called lords [[lord]] of
articles.

[105] when i wrote this i quoted from memory, after many years had
elapsed from my reading the passage. a learned friend has found it and
it is as follows:--

τὸ ἠ̂θος τὸ αὐτό, καὶ ἄμφω δεσποτικὰ τω̂ν βελτιόνων, καὶ τὰ
ψηφίσματα ὥσπερ ἐκει̂ τὰ ἐπιτάγματα, καὶ ὁ δημαγωγὸς καὶ ὁ
κόλαξ οἱ αὐτοὶ καὶ ἀνάλογον. καὶ μάλιστα δ' ἑκάτεροι παρ'

δὲ δημαγωγοὶ παρὰ τοι̂ς δήμοις τοι̂ς τοιούτοις.

"the ethical [[character]] is the same: both exercise despotism over the
better class of [[citizens]]; and decrees are in the one what ordinances and
arrêts are in the other: the demagogue, too, and the court favorite, are
not unfrequently the same identical [[men]], and always bear a close
analogy; and these have the principal [[power]], each in their respective
forms of [[government]], favorites with the absolute monarch, and demagogues
with a [[people]] such as i have described."--arist. [[politic]]. lib. iv. cap.
4.

the wicked [[purpose]] of provoking the populace to all sorts of crimes.

[110] see gulliver's travels for the [[idea]] of countries [[country]] governed by
philosophers.

[111] m. de calonne states the falling off of the [[population]] of [[paris]] as
far more considerable; and it may be so, since the period of m. necker's
calculation.

when i sent this [[book]] to the press, i entertained some [[doubt]] concerning
the [[nature]] and extent of the [[last]] article in the above accounts, which
is only under a general head, without any detail. since then i have seen
m. de calonne's [[work]]. i must [[think]] it a [[great]] loss to me that i had not
that advantage earlier. m. de calonne thinks [[think]] this article to be on
account of general subsistence; but as he is not able to comprehend how
so [[great]] a loss as upwards of 1,661,000_l._ sterling could be sustained
on the difference between the price and the sale of grain, he seems to
attribute this enormous head of charge to secret expenses of the
revolution. i cannot say anything positively on that [[subject]]. the reader
is capable of judging, by the aggregate of these immense charges, on the
state and condition of [[france]], and the [[system]] of [[public]] economy adopted
in that nation. these articles of account produced no inquiry or
discussion in the national assembly.

[113] this is on a supposition of the [[truth]] of this story; but he was
not in [[france]] at the [[time]]. one name serves as well as another.

[114] domat.

[115] [[speech]] of m. camus, published by order of the national assembly.

[116] whether the following description is strictly true i [[know]] not; but
it is what the publishers would have pass for true, in order to animate
others. in a letter from toul, given in one of their papers, is the
following passage concerning the [[people]] of that district:--"dans la
révolution actuelle, ils ont résisté à toutes les _séductions du
bigotisme, aux persécutions et aux tracasseries_ des ennemis de la
révolution. _oubliant leurs plus grands intérêts_ pour rendre hommage
aux vues d'ordre général qui out déterminé l'assemblée nationale, ils
voient, _sans se plaindre_, supprimer cette foule d'établissemens
ecclésiastiques par lesquels _ils subsistoient_; et même, en perdant
leur siège épiscopal, la seule de toutes ces ressources qui pouvoit, on
plutôt _qui devoit, en toute équité_, leur être conservée, condamnés _à
la plus effrayante misère_ sans avoir _été ni pu être entendus, ils ne
murmurent point_, ils restent fidèles aux principes du plus pur
patriotisme; ils sont encore prêts à _verser leur sang_ pour le maintien
de la [[constitution]], qui va réduire leur ville _à la plus déplorable
nullité_."--these [[people]] are not supposed to have endured those
sufferings and injustices in a struggle for [[liberty]], for the same
account states truly that they have been always [[free]]; their patience in
beggary and ruin, and their suffering, without remonstrance, the most
flagrant and confessed [[injustice]], if strictly true, can be nothing but
the effect of this dire fanaticism. a [[great]] multitude all over [[france]] is
in the same condition and the same temper.

[117] see the proceedings of the confederation at nantes.

[118] "si plures sunt ii quibus improbe datum est, quam illi quibus
injuste ademptum est, idcirco plus etiam valent? non enim numero hæc
judicantur, sed pondere. quam autem habet æquitatem, ut agrum multis
annis, aut etiam sæculis ante possessum, qui nullum habuit habeat, qui
autem habuit amittat? ac, propter hoc injuriæ genus, lacedæmonii
lysandrum ephorum expulerunt; agin regem (quod nunquam antea apud eos
acciderat) necaverunt; exque eo tempore tantæ discordiæ secutæ sunt, ut
et tyranni exsisterent, et optimates exterminarentur, et preclarissime
constituta respublica dilaberetur. nec vero solum ipsa cecidit, sed
etiam reliquam græciam evertit contagionibus malorum, quæ a lacedæmoniis
profectæ manarunt latius."--after speaking of the conduct of the model
of true patriots, aratus of sicyon, which was in a very different
spirit, he says,--"sic par est agere cum civibus; non (ut bis jam
vidimus) hastam in foro ponere et bona civium voci subjicere præconis.
at ille græcus (id quod fuit sapientis et præstantis viri) omnibus
consulendum esse putavit: eaque est summa ratio et sapientia boni civis,
commoda civium non divellere, sed omnes eadem æquitate continere."--cic.
off. 1. 2.

[119] see two books [[book]] entitled, "einige originalschriften des
illuminatenordens,"--"system und folgen des illuminatenordens." münchen,
1787.

[120] a leading member of the assembly, m. rabaut de st. étienne, has
expressed the [[principle]] of all their proceedings as clearly as possible;
nothing can be more simple:--"_tous les établissemens en france
couronnent le malheur du peuple: pour le rendre heureux, il faut le
renouveler, changer ses idées, changer ses loix, changer ses mœurs, ...
changer les hommes, changer les choses, changer ses mots, ... tout
détruire; oui, tout détruire; puisque tout est à récréer_."--this
gentleman was chosen president in an assembly not sitting at
_quinze-vingt_ or the _petites maisons_, and composed of persons [[person]] giving
themselves out to be [[rational]] beings; but neither his ideas [[idea]], [[language]],
or conduct differ in the smallest [[degree]] from the discourses, opinions [[opinion]],
and actions of those, within and without the assembly, who direct the
operations of the machine now at [[work]] in [[france]].

[121] the assembly, in executing the plan of their committee, made some
alterations. they have struck out one stage in these gradations; this
removes a part of the objection; but the main objection, namely, that in
their scheme the first constituent voter has no connection with the
representative legislator, remains in all its [[force]]. there are other
alterations, some possibly for the [[better]], some certainly for the worse:
but to the author the [[merit]] or demerit of these smaller alterations
appears to be of no moment, where the scheme itself is fundamentally
vicious and absurd.

[122] "non, ut olim, universæ legiones deducebantur, cum tribunis, et
centurionibus, et sui cujusque ordinis militibus, ut consensu et
caritate rempublicam efficerent; sed ignoti inter se, diversis
manipulis, sine rectore, sine affectibus mutuis, quasi ex alio genere
mortalium repente in unum collecti, numerus magis quam colonia."--tac.
annal. lib. 14, sect. 27.--all this will be still more applicable to the
unconnected, rotatory, biennial national assemblies, in this absurd and
senseless [[constitution]].

[123] qualitas, relatio, actio, passio, ubi, quando, situs, habitus.

[125] in reality three, to reckon the provincial republican
establishments.

[126] for further elucidations upon the [[subject]] of all these judicatures
and of the committee of research, see m. de calonne's [[work]].

[127] "comme sa majesté a reconnu, non un système d'associations
particulières, mais une réunion de volontés de tous les françois pour la
liberté et la prospérité communes, ainsi pour le maintien de l'ordre
publique, il a pensé qu'il convenoit que chaque régiment prît part à ces
fêtes civiques pour multiplier les rapports, et resserrer les liens
d'union entre les citoyens et les troupes."--lest i should not be
credited, i insert the words authorizing the [[troops]] to feast with the
popular confederacies.

[128] this [[war]] minister has since quitted the school and resigned his
office.

[129] courrier françois, 30 july, 1790. assemblée nationale, numero 210.

[130] i see by m. necker's account, that the national guards of paris
have received, over and above the [[money]] levied within their own [[city]],
about 145,000_l._ sterling out of the [[public]] treasure. whether this be
an actual payment for the nine months of their existence, or an estimate
of their yearly charge, i do not clearly perceive. it is of no great
importance, as certainly they may take whatever they please.

[131] the reader will observe that i have but lightly touched (my plan
demanded nothing more) on the condition of the french finances as
connected with the demands upon them. if i had intended to do otherwise,
the materials in my hands for such a task are not altogether [[perfect]]. on
this [[subject]] i refer the reader to m. de calonne's [[work]], and the
tremendous display that he has made of the havoc and devastation in the
public estate, and in all the affairs of [[france]], caused by the
presumptuous [[good]] intentions of ignorance and incapacity. such effects
those causes will always [[produce]]. looking over that account with a
pretty strict eye, and, with perhaps too much rigor, deducting
everything which may be placed to the account of a financier out of
place, who might be supposed by his enemies [[enemy]] desirous of making the most
of his cause, i [[believe]] it will be found that a more salutary lesson of
caution against the daring spirit of innovators than what has been
supplied at the expense of [[france]] never was at any [[time]] furnished to
mankind.

[133] "ce n'est point à l'assemblée entière que je m'adresse ici; je ne
parle qu'à ceux qui l'égarent, en lui cachant sous des gazes séduisantes
le but où ils l'entraînent. c'est à eux que je dis: votre objet, vous
n'en disconviendrez pas, c'est d'ôter tout espoir au clergé, et de
consommer sa ruine; c'est-là, en ne vous soupçonnant d'aucune
combinaison de cupidité, d'aucun regard sur le jeu des effets publics,
c'est-là ce qu'on doit croire que vous avez en vue dans la terrible
opération que vous proposez; c'est ce qui doit en être le fruit. mais le
peuple qui vous y intéressez, quel avantage peut-il y trouver? en vous
servant sans cesse de lui, que faites-vous pour lui? rien, absolument
rien; et, au contraire, vous faites ce qui ne conduit qu'à l'accabler de
nouvelles charges. vous avez rejeté, à [[son]] préjudice, une offre de 400
millions, dont l'acceptation pouvoit devenir un moyen de soulagement en
sa faveur; et à cette ressource, aussi profitable que légitime, vous
avez substitué une [[injustice]] ruineuse, qui, de votre propre aveu, charge
le trésor [[public]], et par consequent le peuple, d'un surcroît de dépense
annuelle de 50 millions an moins, et d'un remboursement de 150 millions.

"malheureux peuple! voilà ce que vous vaut en dernier résultat
l'expropriation de l'église, et la dureté des décrets taxateurs du
traitement des ministres d'une [[religion]] bienfaisante; et désormais ils
scront à votre charge: leurs charités soulageoient les pauvres; et vous
allez être imposés pour subvenir à leur entretien!"--_de l'état de la
france,_ p. 81. see also p. 92, and the following pages.
