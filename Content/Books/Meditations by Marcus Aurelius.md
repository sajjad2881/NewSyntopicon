the meditations
by marcus aurelius


translated by george long

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book one

from my grandfather verus i learned [[good]] morals [[moral]] and the government
of my temper. 

from the [[reputation]] and remembrance of my [[father]], modesty and a manly
character. 

from my [[mother]], piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from
evil deeds, but even from [[evil]] thoughts [[thought]]; and further, simplicity in
my way of living, far removed from the habits of the [[rich]].

from my great-grandfather, not to have frequented [[public]] schools,
and to have had [[good]] teachers at [[home]], and to [[know]] that on such things
a [[man]] should spend liberally. 

from my governor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue party
at the games in the circus, nor a partizan either of the parmularius
or the scutarius at the gladiators' fights; from him too i learned
endurance of [[labour]], and to want little, and to [[work]] with my own hands,
and not to meddle with other people's affairs, and not to be ready
to listen to slander. 

from diognetus, not to busy myself about trifling things, and not
to give credit to what was said by miracle-workers and jugglers about
incantations and the driving away of daemons and such things; and
not to breed quails for fighting, nor to give myself up passionately
to such things; and to endure [[freedom]] of [[speech]]; and to have become
intimate with [[philosophy]]; and to have been a hearer, first of bacchius,
then of tandasis and marcianus; and to have written dialogues in my
youth; and to have [[desired]] a plank bed and skin, and whatever else
of the [[kind]] belongs to the grecian discipline. 

from rusticus i received the impression that my [[character]] required
improvement and discipline; and from him i learned not to be [[led]] astray
to sophistic emulation, nor to writing on speculative matters, nor
to delivering little hortatory orations, nor to showing myself off
as a [[man]] who practises much discipline, or does benevolent acts in
order to make a display; and to abstain from rhetoric, and poetry,
and fine writing; and not to walk about in the house in my outdoor
dress, nor to do other things of the [[kind]]; and to write my letters
with simplicity, like the letter which rusticus wrote from sinuessa
to my [[mother]]; and with [[respect]] to those who have offended me by words,
or done me [[wrong]], to be easily disposed to be pacified and reconciled,
as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled; and to read
carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding
of a [[book]]; nor hastily to give my assent to those who talk overmuch;
and i am indebted to him for being acquainted with the discourses
of epictetus, which he communicated to me out of his own collection.

from apollonius i learned [[freedom]] of will and undeviating steadiness
of [[purpose]]; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except
to [[reason]]; and to be always the same, in sharp pains [[pain]], on the occasion
of the loss of a child, and in long illness; and to see clearly in
a living [[example]] that the same [[man]] can be both most resolute and yielding,
and not peevish in giving his instruction; and to have had before
my [[eyes]] a [[man]] who clearly considered his [[experience]] and his skill
in expounding philosophical principles [[principle]] as the smallest of his merits [[merit]];
and from him i learned how to receive from [[friends]] what are esteemed
favours, without being either humbled by them or letting them pass
unnoticed. 

from sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the [[example]] of a family
governed in a fatherly manner, and the [[idea]] of living conformably
to [[nature]]; and gravity without affectation, and to look carefully
after the interests of [[friends]], and to tolerate ignorant persons [[person]],
and those who form opinions [[opinion]] without consideration: he had the power
of readily accommodating himself to all, so that intercourse with
him was more agreeable than any [[flattery]]; and at the same [[time]] he
was most highly venerated by those who associated with him: and he
had the faculty both of discovering and ordering, in an intelligent
and methodical way, the principles [[principle]] necessary for [[life]]; and he never
showed anger or any other passion, but was entirely [[free]] from passion,
and also most affectionate; and he could express approbation without
noisy display, and he possessed much [[knowledge]] without ostentation.

from alexander the grammarian, to refrain from fault-finding, and
not in a reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous
or solecistic or strange-sounding expression; but dexterously to introduce
the very expression which ought to have been used, and in the way
of [[answer]] or giving confirmation, or joining in an inquiry about the
thing itself, not about the word, or by some other fit suggestion.

from fronto i learned to observe what envy, and duplicity, and hypocrisy
are in a [[tyrant]], and that generally those among us who are called
patricians are rather deficient in paternal affection. 

from alexander the platonic, not frequently nor without necessity
to say to any one, or to write in a letter, that i have no leisure;
nor continually to excuse the neglect of duties [[duty]] required by our relation
to those with whom we [[live]], by alleging urgent occupations.

from catulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds [[fault]], even
if he should find [[fault]] without [[reason]], but to try to restore him
to his usual disposition; and to be ready to speak well of teachers,
as it is reported of domitius and athenodotus; and to [[love]] my children
truly. 

from my [[brother]] severus, to [[love]] my kin, and to [[love]] [[truth]], and to
love [[justice]]; and through him i learned to [[know]] thrasea, helvidius,
cato, dion, brutus; and from him i received the [[idea]] of a polity in
which there is the same [[law]] for all, a polity administered with regard
to [[equal]] rights [[right]] and [[equal]] [[freedom]] of [[speech]], and the [[idea]] of a kingly
government which respects [[respect]] most of all the [[freedom]] of the governed;
i learned from him also consistency and undeviating steadiness in
my regard for [[philosophy]]; and a disposition to do [[good]], and to give
to others readily, and to cherish [[good]] hopes [[hope]], and to [[believe]] that
i am loved by my [[friends]]; and in him i observed no concealment of
his opinions [[opinion]] with [[respect]] to those whom he condemned, and that his
friends had no need to conjecture what he wished or did not [[wish]],
but it was quite plain. 

from maximus i learned self-government, and not to be [[led]] aside by
anything; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness;
and a just admixture in the [[moral]] [[character]] of sweetness and [[dignity]],
and to do what was set before me without complaining. i observed that
everybody believed that he [[thought]] as he spoke, and that in all that
he did he never had any [[bad]] intention; and he never showed amazement
and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a
thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise
his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious.
he was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to [[forgive]],
and was [[free]] from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of
a [[man]] who could not be diverted from [[right]] rather than of a [[man]] who
had been improved. i observed, too, that no [[man]] could ever [[think]] that
he was despised by maximus, or ever venture to [[think]] himself a better
man. he had also the art [[arts]] of being humorous in an agreeable way.

in my [[father]] i observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution
in the things which he had determined after due deliberation; and
no vainglory in those things which [[men]] call honours [[honour]]; and a [[love]] of
labour and perseverance; and a readiness to listen to those who had
anything to propose for the [[common]] weal; and undeviating firmness
in giving to every [[man]] according to his deserts; and a [[knowledge]] derived
from [[experience]] of the occasions [[occasion]] for vigorous action and for remission.
and i observed that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered
himself no more than any other citizen; and he released his friends
from all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of necessity
when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by
reason of any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. i observed
too his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and
his persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation through
being satisfied with appearances which first [[present]] themselves; and
that his disposition was to keep his [[friends]], and not to be soon tired
of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied
on all occasions [[occasion]], and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off,
and to provide for the smallest without display; and to check immediately
popular applause and all [[flattery]]; and to be ever watchful over the
things which were necessary for the administration of the [[empire]],
and to be a [[good]] manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure
the blame which he got for such conduct; and he was neither superstitious
with [[respect]] to the gods, nor did he court [[men]] by gifts or by trying
to please them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety
in all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts [[thought]] or action,
nor [[love]] of novelty. and the things which conduce in any way to the
commodity of [[life]], and of which [[fortune]] gives an abundant supply,
he used without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when
he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had
them not, he did not want them. no one could ever say of him that
he was either a sophist or a home-bred flippant [[slave]] or a pedant;
but every one acknowledged him to be a [[man]] ripe, [[perfect]], above [[flattery]],
able to manage his own and other men's affairs. besides this, he honoured
those who were true [[philosophers]], and he did not reproach those who
pretended to be [[philosophers]], nor yet was he easily [[led]] by them. he
was also easy in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without
any offensive affectation. he took a reasonable [[care]] of his body's
health, not as one who was greatly attached to [[life]], nor out of regard
to personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that, through
his own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician's
art or of medicine or external applications. he was most ready to
give way without envy to those who possessed any particular faculty,
such as that of eloquence or [[knowledge]] of the [[law]] or of morals [[moral]], or
of anything else; and he gave them his [[help]], that each might enjoy
reputation according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably
to the [[institutions]] of his [[country]], without showing any affectation
of doing so. further, he was not fond of [[change]] nor unsteady, but
he loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the
same things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately
fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. his secrets were not
but very few and very rare, and these only about [[public]] matters; and
he showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the [[public]] spectacles
and the construction of [[public]] buildings, his donations to the [[people]],
and in such things, for he was a [[man]] who looked to what ought to be
done, not to the [[reputation]] which is got by a man's [[man]] acts. he did not
take the bath at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses,
nor [[curious]] about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of
his clothes, nor about the [[beauty]] of his slaves [[slave]]. his dress came from
lorium, his villa on the coast, and from lanuvium generally. we know
how he behaved to the toll-collector at tusculum who [[asked]] his pardon;
and such was all his behaviour. there was in him nothing harsh, nor
implacable, nor [[violent]], nor, as one may say, anything carried to
the sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he
had abundance of [[time]], and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously
and consistently. and that might be applied to him which is recorded
of [[socrates]], that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy,
those things which many are too [[weak]] to abstain from, and cannot enjoy
without excess. but to be [[strong]] enough both to bear the one and to
be sober in the other is the mark of a [[man]] who has a [[perfect]] and invincible
soul, such as he showed in the illness of maximus. 

to the gods i am indebted for having [[good]] grandfathers, [[good]] parents,
a [[good]] sister, [[good]] teachers, [[good]] associates, [[good]] kinsmen and [[friends]],
nearly everything [[good]]. further, i owe it to the gods that i was not
hurried into any offence against any of them, though i had a disposition
which, if opportunity had offered, might have [[led]] me to do something
of this [[kind]]; but, through their favour, there never was such a concurrence
of circumstances as put me to the [[trial]]. further, i am thankful to
the gods that i was not longer brought up with my grandfather's concubine,
and that i preserved the flower of my [[youth]], and that i did not make
proof of my virility before the proper season, but even deferred the
time; that i was subjected to a ruler and a [[father]] who was able to
take away all [[pride]] from me, and to bring me to the [[knowledge]] that
it is possible for a [[man]] to [[live]] in a palace without wanting either
guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, and such-like
show; but that it is in such a man's [[man]] [[power]] to bring himself very near
to the [[fashion]] of a private [[person]], without being for this reason
either meaner in [[thought]], or more remiss in action, with [[respect]] to
the things which must be done for the [[public]] interest in a manner
that befits a ruler. i thank the gods for giving me such a [[brother]],
who was able by his [[moral]] [[character]] to rouse me to vigilance over
myself, and who, at the same [[time]], pleased me by his [[respect]] and affection;
that my [[children]] have not been stupid nor deformed in [[body]]; that i
did not make more proficiency in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies,
in which i should perhaps have been completely engaged, if i had seen
that i was making [[progress]] in them; that i made haste to place those
who brought me up in the station of [[honour]], which they seemed to [[desire]],
without putting them off with [[hope]] of my doing it some [[time]] after,
because they were then still [[young]]; that i knew apollonius, rusticus,
maximus; that i received clear and frequent impressions about living
according to [[nature]], and what [[kind]] of a [[life]] that is, so that, so
far as depended on the gods, and their gifts, and [[help]], and inspirations,
nothing hindered me from forthwith living according to [[nature]], though
i still fall short of it through my own [[fault]], and through not observing
the admonitions of the gods, and, i may almost say, their direct instructions;
that my [[body]] has held out so long in such a [[kind]] of [[life]]; that i never
touched either benedicta or theodotus, and that, after having fallen
into amatory [[passions]], i was cured; and, though i was often out of
humour with rusticus, i never did anything of which i had occasion
to repent; that, though it was my mother's [[fate]] to [[die]] [[young]], she
spent the [[last]] years of her [[life]] with me; that, whenever i wished
to [[help]] any [[man]] in his need, or on any other [[occasion]], i was never
told that i had not the means of doing it; and that to myself the
same necessity never happened, to receive anything from another; that
i have such a [[wife]], so [[obedient]], and so affectionate, and so simple;
that i had abundance of [[good]] masters for my [[children]]; and that remedies
have been shown to me by dreams [[dream]], both others, and against bloodspitting
and giddiness...; and that, when i had an inclination to [[philosophy]],
i did not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that i did not waste
my [[time]] on writers of histories [[history]], or in the resolution of syllogisms,
or occupy myself about the investigation of appearances in the heavens [[heaven]];
for all these things require the [[help]] of the gods and [[fortune]].

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book two

begin the morning by saying to thyself, i shall meet with the busy-body,
the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. all these
things happen to them by [[reason]] of their ignorance of what is good
and [[evil]]. but i who have seen the [[nature]] of the [[good]] that it is beautiful,
and of the [[bad]] that it is ugly, and the [[nature]] of him who does [[wrong]],
that it is akin to me, not only of the same [[blood]] or seed, but that
it participates in the same [[intelligence]] and the same portion of the
divinity, i can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can
fix on me what is ugly, nor can i be angry with my kinsman, nor hate
him, for we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands, like
eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. to act against
one another then is contrary to [[nature]]; and it is acting against one
another to be vexed and to turn away. 

whatever this is that i am, it is a little flesh and breath, and the
ruling part. throw away thy books [[book]]; no longer distract thyself: it
is not allowed; but as if thou wast now dying, despise the flesh;
it is [[blood]] and bones and a network, a contexture of nerves, veins,
and arteries. see the breath also, what [[kind]] of a thing it is, air,
and not always the same, but every moment sent out and again sucked
in. the third then is the ruling part: consider thus: thou art [[arts]] an
old [[man]]; no longer let this be a [[slave]], no longer be pulled by the
strings like a puppet to unsocial movements, no longer either be dissatisfied
with thy [[present]] lot, or shrink from the future. 

all that is from the gods is full of providence. that which is from
fortune is not separated from [[nature]] or without an interweaving and
involution with the things which are ordered by providence. from thence
all things flow; and there is besides necessity, and that which is
for the advantage of the whole [[universe]], of which thou art [[arts]] a part.
but that is [[good]] for every part of [[nature]] which the [[nature]] of the
whole brings, and what serves to maintain this [[nature]]. now the universe
is preserved, as by the changes [[change]] of the elements so by the changes
of things compounded of the elements. let these principles [[principle]] be enough
for thee, let them always be fixed opinions [[opinion]]. but cast away the thirst
after books [[book]], that thou mayest not [[die]] murmuring, but cheerfully, truly,
and from thy [[heart]] thankful to the gods. 

remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how
often thou hast received an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost
not use it. thou must now at [[last]] perceive of what [[universe]] thou art
a part, and of what administrator of the [[universe]] thy existence is
an efflux, and that a limit of [[time]] is fixed for thee, which if thou
dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy [[mind]], it will go
and thou wilt go, and it will never return. 

every moment [[think]] steadily as a roman and a [[man]] to do what thou hast
in hand with [[perfect]] and simple [[dignity]], and feeling of affection,
and [[freedom]], and [[justice]]; and to give thyself relief from all other
thoughts. and thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act
of thy [[life]] as if it were the [[last]], laying aside all carelessness
and passionate aversion from the commands of [[reason]], and all hypocrisy,
and self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given
to thee. thou seest how few the things are, the which if a [[man]] lays
hold of, he is able to [[live]] a [[life]] which flows in quiet, and is like
the existence of the gods; for the gods on their part will require
nothing more from him who observes these things. 

do [[wrong]] to thyself, do [[wrong]] to thyself, my [[soul]]; but thou wilt no
longer have the opportunity of honouring thyself. every man's [[man]] life
is sufficient. but thine is nearly finished, though thy [[soul]] reverences
not itself but places thy felicity in the souls [[soul]] of others.

do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? give thyself
time to learn something new and [[good]], and cease to be whirled around.
but then thou must also avoid being carried about the other way. for
those too are triflers who have wearied themselves in [[life]] by their
activity, and yet have no object to which to direct every movement,
and, in a word, all their thoughts [[thought]]. 

through not observing what is in the [[mind]] of another a [[man]] has seldom
been seen to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movements
of their own minds [[mind]] must of necessity be unhappy. 

this thou must always bear in [[mind]], what is the [[nature]] of the whole,
and what is my [[nature]], and how this is related to that, and what kind
of a part it is of what [[kind]] of a whole; and that there is no one
who hinders thee from always doing and saying the things which are
according to the [[nature]] of which thou art [[arts]] a part. 

theophrastus, in his comparison of [[bad]] acts- such a comparison as
one would make in accordance with the [[common]] notions of mankind- says,
like a true philosopher, that the offences which are committed through
desire are more blameable than those which are committed through anger.
for he who is excited by anger seems to turn away from [[reason]] with
a [[certain]] [[pain]] and unconscious contraction; but he who offends through
desire, being overpowered by [[pleasure]], seems to be in a manner more
intemperate and more womanish in his offences. rightly then, and in
a way worthy of [[philosophy]], he said that the offence which is committed
with [[pleasure]] is more blameable than that which is committed with
pain; and on the whole the one is more like a [[person]] who has been
first wronged and through [[pain]] is compelled to be angry; but the other
is moved by his own impulse to do [[wrong]], being carried towards doing
something by [[desire]]. 

since it is possible that thou mayest depart from [[life]] this very moment,
regulate every act and [[thought]] accordingly. but to go away from among
men, if there are gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for the gods
will not involve thee in [[evil]]; but if indeed they do not [[exist]], or
if they have no concern about [[human]] affairs, what is it to me to live
in a [[universe]] devoid of gods or devoid of providence? but in truth
they do [[exist]], and they do [[care]] for [[human]] things, and they have put
all the means in man's [[man]] [[power]] to enable him not to fall into real evils [[evil]].
and as to the rest, if there was anything [[evil]], they would have provided
for this also, that it should be altogether in a man's [[man]] [[power]] not to
fall into it. now that which does not make a [[man]] worse, how can it
make a man's [[man]] [[life]] worse? but neither through ignorance, nor having
the [[knowledge]], but not the [[power]] to guard against or [[correct]] these
things, is it possible that the [[nature]] of the [[universe]] has overlooked
them; nor is it possible that it has made so [[great]] a mistake, either
through want of [[power]] or want of [[skill]], that [[good]] and [[evil]] should
happen indiscriminately to the [[good]] and the [[bad]]. but [[death]] certainly,
and [[life]], [[honour]] and dishonour, [[pain]] and [[pleasure]], all these things
equally happen to [[good]] [[men]] and [[bad]], being things which make us neither
better nor worse. therefore they are neither [[good]] nor [[evil]].

how quickly all things disappear, in the [[universe]] the bodies [[body]] themselves,
but in [[time]] the remembrance of them; what is the [[nature]] of all sensible
things, and particularly those which attract with the bait of pleasure
or terrify by [[pain]], or are noised abroad by vapoury fame; how worthless,
and contemptible, and sordid, and perishable, and [[dead]] they are- all
this it is the part of the intellectual faculty to observe. to observe
too who these are whose opinions [[opinion]] and voices give [[reputation]]; what
death is, and the [[fact]] that, if a [[man]] looks at it in itself, and by
the abstractive [[power]] of reflection resolves into their parts all
the things which [[present]] themselves to the [[imagination]] in it, he will
then consider it to be nothing else than an operation of [[nature]]; and
if any one is afraid of an operation of [[nature]], he is a child. this,
however, is not only an operation of [[nature]], but it is also a thing
which conduces to the purposes [[purpose]] of [[nature]]. to observe too how [[man]] comes
near to the deity, and by what part of him, and when this part of
man is so disposed. 

nothing is more wretched than a [[man]] who traverses everything in a
round, and pries into the things beneath the [[earth]], as the poet says,
and seeks by conjecture what is in the minds [[mind]] of his neighbours, without
perceiving that it is sufficient to attend to the daemon within him,
and to reverence it sincerely. and reverence of the daemon consists
in keeping it pure from passion and thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction
with what comes from gods and [[men]]. for the things from the gods merit
veneration for their excellence; and the things from [[men]] should be
dear to us by [[reason]] of kinship; and sometimes even, in a manner,
they move our [[pity]] by [[reason]] of men's ignorance of [[good]] and [[bad]]; this
defect being not less than that which deprives us of the [[power]] of
distinguishing things that are [[white]] and black. 

though thou shouldst be going to [[live]] three thousand years, and as
many times [[time]] ten thousand years, still [[remember]] that no [[man]] loses any
other [[life]] than this which he now lives [[life]], nor lives [[life]] any other than
this which he now loses. the longest and shortest are thus brought
to the same. for the [[present]] is the same to all, though that which
perishes is not the same; and so that which is lost appears to be
a mere moment. for a [[man]] cannot lose either the [[past]] or the future:
for what a [[man]] has not, how can any one take this from him? these
two things then thou must bear in [[mind]]; the one, that all things from
eternity are of like forms and come round in a circle, and that it
makes no difference whether a [[man]] shall see the same things during
a hundred years or two hundred, or an infinite [[time]]; and the second,
that the longest liver and he who will [[die]] soonest lose just the same.
for the [[present]] is the only thing of which a [[man]] can be deprived,
if it is true that this is the only thing which he has, and that a
man cannot lose a thing if he has it not. 

remember that all is [[opinion]]. for what was said by the cynic monimus
is manifest: and manifest too is the use of what was said, if a man
receives what may be got out of it as far as it is true.

the [[soul]] of [[man]] does [[violence]] to itself, first of all, when it becomes
an abscess and, as it were, a tumour on the [[universe]], so far as it
can. for to be vexed at anything which happens is a separation of
ourselves from [[nature]], in some part of which the natures [[nature]] of all other
things are contained. in the next place, the [[soul]] does [[violence]] to
itself when it turns away from any [[man]], or even moves towards him
with the intention of injuring, such as are the souls [[soul]] of those who
are angry. in the third place, the [[soul]] does [[violence]] to itself when
it is overpowered by [[pleasure]] or by [[pain]]. fourthly, when it plays
a part, and does or says anything insincerely and untruly. fifthly,
when it allows any act of its own and any movement to be without an
aim, and does anything thoughtlessly and without considering what
it is, it being [[right]] that even the smallest things be done with reference
to an end; and the end of [[rational]] animals is to [[follow]] the reason
and the [[law]] of the most ancient [[city]] and polity. 

of [[human]] [[life]] the [[time]] is a point, and the substance is in a flux,
and the perception dull, and the composition of the whole [[body]] subject
to putrefaction, and the [[soul]] a whirl, and [[fortune]] hard to [[divine]],
and fame a thing devoid of judgement. and, to say all in a word, everything
which belongs to the [[body]] is a stream, and what belongs to the soul
is a [[dream]] and vapour, and [[life]] is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn,
and after-fame is oblivion. what then is that which is able to conduct
a [[man]]? one thing and only one, [[philosophy]]. but this consists in keeping
the daemon within a [[man]] [[free]] from [[violence]] and unharmed, superior
to pains [[pain]] and pleasures [[pleasure]], doing nothing without [[purpose]], nor yet falsely
and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man's [[man]] doing or
not doing anything; and besides, accepting all that happens, and all
that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence
he himself came; and, finally, waiting for [[death]] with a cheerful [[mind]],
as being nothing else than a dissolution of the elements of which
every living being is compounded. but if there is no harm to the elements
themselves in each continually changing into another, why should a
man have any apprehension about the [[change]] and dissolution of all
the elements? for it is according to [[nature]], and nothing is [[evil]] which
is according to [[nature]]. 

this in carnuntum. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book three

we ught to consider not only that our [[life]] is daily wasting away
and a smaller part of it is left, but another thing also must be taken
into the account, that if a [[man]] should [[live]] longer, it is quite uncertain
whether the understanding will still continue sufficient for the comprehension
of things, and retain the [[power]] of contemplation which strives to
acquire the [[knowledge]] of the [[divine]] and the [[human]]. for if he shall
begin to fall into dotage, perspiration and nutrition and imagination
and appetite, and whatever else there is of the [[kind]], will not fail;
but the [[power]] of making use of ourselves, and filling up the measure
of our [[duty]], and clearly separating all appearances, and considering
whether a [[man]] should now depart from [[life]], and whatever else of the
kind absolutely requires a disciplined [[reason]], all this is already
extinguished. we must make haste then, not only because we are daily
nearer to [[death]], but also because the conception of things and the
understanding of them cease first. 

we ought to observe also that even the things which [[follow]] after the
things which are produced according to [[nature]] contain something pleasing
and attractive. for instance, when bread is baked some parts are split
at the surface, and these parts which thus open, and have a certain
fashion contrary to the [[purpose]] of the baker's art [[arts]], are beautiful
in a manner, and in a peculiar way excite a [[desire]] for eating. and
again, figs, when they are quite ripe, gape open; and in the ripe
olives the very circumstance of their being near to rottenness adds
a peculiar [[beauty]] to the fruit. and the ears of corn bending down,
and the lion's eyebrows, and the foam which flows from the mouth of
wild boars, and many other things- though they are far from being
beautiful, if a [[man]] should examine them severally- still, because
they are consequent upon the things which are formed by [[nature]], help
to adorn them, and they please the [[mind]]; so that if a [[man]] should have
a feeling and deeper insight with [[respect]] to the things which are
produced in the [[universe]], there is hardly one of those which follow
by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner
disposed so as to give [[pleasure]]. and so he will see even the real
gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less [[pleasure]] than those which
painters and sculptors show by imitation; and in an old woman and
an old [[man]] he will be able to see a [[certain]] maturity and comeliness;
and the attractive loveliness of [[young]] persons [[person]] he will be able to
look on with chaste [[eyes]]; and many such things will [[present]] themselves,
not pleasing to every [[man]], but to him only who has become truly familiar
with [[nature]] and her works [[work]]. 

hippocrates after curing many diseases himself fell sick and died.
the chaldaei foretold the deaths [[death]] of many, and then [[fate]] caught them
too. alexander, and pompeius, and caius caesar, after so often completely
destroying whole cities [[city]], and in [[battle]] cutting to pieces many ten
thousands of cavalry and infantry, themselves too at [[last]] departed
from [[life]]. heraclitus, after so many speculations on the conflagration
of the [[universe]], was filled with water internally and died smeared
all over with mud. and lice destroyed democritus; and other lice killed
socrates. what means all this? thou hast embarked, thou hast made
the [[voyage]], thou art [[arts]] come to shore; get out. if indeed to another
life, there is no want of gods, not even there. but if to a state
without sensation, thou wilt cease to be held by pains [[pain]] and pleasures [[pleasure]],
and to be a [[slave]] to the vessel, which is as much inferior as that
which serves it is superior: for the one is [[intelligence]] and deity;
the other is [[earth]] and [[corruption]]. 

do not waste the remainder of thy [[life]] in thoughts [[thought]] about others, when
thou dost not refer thy thoughts [[thought]] to some object of [[common]] utility.
for thou losest the opportunity of doing something else when thou
hast such thoughts [[thought]] as these, what is such a [[person]] doing, and why,
and what is he saying, and what is he thinking of, and what is he
contriving, and whatever else of the [[kind]] makes us wander away from
the observation of our own ruling [[power]]. we ought then to check in
the series of our thoughts [[thought]] everything that is without a [[purpose]] and
useless, but most of all the over-curious feeling and the malignant;
and a [[man]] should use himself to [[think]] of those things only about which
if one should suddenly ask, what hast thou now in thy thoughts [[thought]]? with
perfect openness thou mightest, immediately [[answer]], this or that;
so that from thy words it should be plain that everything in thee
is simple and benevolent, and such as befits a social animal, and
one that cares [[care]] not for thoughts [[thought]] about [[pleasure]] or sensual enjoyments
at all, nor has any rivalry or envy and suspicion, or anything else
for which thou wouldst blush if thou shouldst say that thou hadst
it in thy [[mind]]. for the [[man]] who is such and no longer delays being
among the number of the [[best]], is like a [[priest]] and minister of the
gods, using too the deity which is planted within him, which makes
the [[man]] uncontaminated by [[pleasure]], unharmed by any [[pain]], untouched
by any insult, feeling no [[wrong]], a fighter in the noblest [[fight]], one
who cannot be overpowered by any passion, dyed deep with [[justice]],
accepting with all his [[soul]] everything which happens and is assigned
to him as his portion; and not often, nor yet without [[great]] necessity
and for the general interest, imagining what another says, or does,
or thinks [[think]]. for it is only what belongs to himself that he makes the
matter for his activity; and he constantly thinks [[think]] of that which is
allotted to himself out of the sum total of things, and he makes his
own acts [[fair]], and he is persuaded that his own portion is [[good]]. for
the lot which is assigned to each [[man]] is carried along with him and
carries him along with it. and he remembers also that every rational
animal is his kinsman, and that to [[care]] for all [[men]] is according to
man's [[nature]]; and a [[man]] should hold on to the [[opinion]] not of all,
but of those only who confessedly [[live]] according to [[nature]]. but as
to those who [[live]] not so, he always bears in [[mind]] what [[kind]] of men
they are both at [[home]] and from [[home]], both by night and by day, and
what they are, and with what [[men]] they [[live]] an impure [[life]]. accordingly,
he does not value at all the [[praise]] which comes from such [[men]], since
they are not even satisfied with themselves. 

labour not unwillingly, nor without regard to the [[common]] interest,
nor without due consideration, nor with distraction; nor let studied
ornament set off thy thoughts [[thought]], and be not either a [[man]] of many words,
or busy about too many things. and further, let the deity which is
in thee be the guardian of a living being, manly and of ripe [[age]],
and engaged in matter [[political]], and a roman, and a ruler, who has
taken his post like a [[man]] waiting for the signal which summons him
from [[life]], and ready to go, having need neither of oath nor of any
man's testimony. be cheerful also, and seek not external [[help]] nor
the tranquility which others give. a [[man]] then must stand erect, not
be kept erect by others. 

if thou findest in [[human]] [[life]] anything [[better]] than [[justice]], [[truth]],
temperance, fortitude, and, in a word, anything [[better]] than thy own
mind's self-satisfaction in the things which it enables thee to do
according to [[right]] [[reason]], and in the condition that is assigned to
thee without thy own [[choice]]; if, i say, thou seest anything better
than this, turn to it with all thy [[soul]], and enjoy that which thou
hast found to be the [[best]]. but if nothing appears to be [[better]] than
the deity which is planted in thee, which has subjected to itself
all thy appetites, and carefully examines all the impressions, and,
as [[socrates]] said, has detached itself from the persuasions of sense,
and has submitted itself to the gods, and cares [[care]] for [[mankind]]; if thou
findest everything else smaller and of less value than this, give
place to nothing else, for if thou dost once diverge and incline to
it, thou wilt no longer without distraction be able to give the preference
to that [[good]] thing which is thy proper possession and thy own; for
it is not [[right]] that anything of any other [[kind]], such as [[praise]] from
the many, or [[power]], or enjoyment of [[pleasure]], should come into competition
with that which is rationally and politically or practically [[good]].
all these things, even though they may seem to adapt themselves to
the [[better]] things in a small [[degree]], obtain the superiority all at
once, and carry us away. but do thou, i say, simply and freely choose
the [[better]], and hold to it.- but that which is useful is the [[better]].-
well then, if it is useful to thee as a [[rational]] being, keep to it;
but if it is only useful to thee as an animal, say so, and maintain
thy judgement without arrogance: only take [[care]] that thou makest the
inquiry by a sure method. 

never value anything as profitable to thyself which shall compel thee
to break thy promise, to lose thy self-respect, to hate any [[man]], to
suspect, to curse, to act the hypocrite, to [[desire]] anything which
needs walls and curtains: for he who has preferred to everything intelligence
and daemon and the [[worship]] of its excellence, acts no tragic part,
does not groan, will not need either solitude or much company; and,
what is [[chief]] of all, he will [[live]] without either pursuing or flying
from [[death]]; but whether for a longer or a shorter [[time]] he shall have
the [[soul]] inclosed in the [[body]], he cares [[care]] not at all: for even if he
must depart immediately, he will go as readily as if he were going
to do anything else which can be done with decency and order; taking
care of this only all through [[life]], that his thoughts [[thought]] turn not away
from anything which belongs to an [[intelligent]] animal and a member
of a civil [[community]]. 

in the [[mind]] of one who is chastened and purified thou wilt find no
corrupt matter, nor impurity, nor any sore skinned over. nor is his
life incomplete when [[fate]] overtakes him, as one may say of an actor
who leaves the stage before ending and finishing the play. besides,
there is in him nothing servile, nor affected, nor too closely bound
to other things, nor yet detached from other things, nothing worthy
of blame, nothing which seeks a hiding-place. 

reverence the faculty which produces [[produce]] [[opinion]]. on this faculty it entirely
depends whether there shall [[exist]] in thy ruling part any [[opinion]] inconsistent
with [[nature]] and the [[constitution]] of the [[rational]] animal. and this
faculty promises [[freedom]] from hasty judgement, and [[friendship]] towards
men, and [[obedience]] to the gods. 

throwing away then all things, hold to these only which are few; and
besides bear in [[mind]] that every [[man]] lives [[life]] only this [[present]] [[time]],
which is an indivisible point, and that all the rest of his [[life]] is
either [[past]] or it is uncertain. short then is the [[time]] which every
man lives [[life]], and small the nook of the [[earth]] where he lives [[life]]; and short
too the longest posthumous fame, and even this only continued by a
succession of [[poor]] [[human]] beings, who will very soon [[die]], and who know
not even themselves, much less him who died long ago. 

to the aids which have been mentioned let this one still be added:-
make for thyself a definition or description of the thing which is
presented to thee, so as to see distinctly what [[kind]] of a thing it
is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and
tell thyself its proper name, and the names of the things of which
it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. for nothing
is so productive of elevation of [[mind]] as to be able to examine methodically
and truly every object which is presented to thee in [[life]], and always
to look at things so as to see at the same [[time]] what [[kind]] of universe
this is, and what [[kind]] of use everything performs in it, and what
value everything has with reference to the whole, and what with reference
to [[man]], who is a citizen of the highest [[city]], of which all other cities
are like families [[family]]; what each thing is, and of what it is composed,
and how long it is the [[nature]] of this thing to endure which now makes
an impression on me, and what [[virtue]] i have need of with [[respect]] to
it, such as gentleness, manliness, [[truth]], fidelity, simplicity, contentment,
and the rest. wherefore, on every [[occasion]] a [[man]] should say: this
comes from [[god]]; and this is according to the apportionment and spinning
of the thread of [[destiny]], and such-like coincidence and [[chance]]; and
this is from one of the same stock, and a kinsman and partner, one
who knows [[know]] not however what is according to his [[nature]]. but i [[know]];
for this [[reason]] i behave towards him according to the [[natural]] law
of fellowship with benevolence and [[justice]]. at the same [[time]] however
in things indifferent i attempt to ascertain the value of each.

if thou workest at that which is before thee, following [[right]] reason
seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract
thee, but keeping thy [[divine]] part pure, as if thou shouldst be bound
to give it back immediately; if thou holdest to this, expecting nothing,
fearing nothing, but satisfied with thy [[present]] activity according
to [[nature]], and with heroic [[truth]] in every word and sound which thou
utterest, thou wilt [[live]] [[happy]]. and there is no [[man]] who is able to
prevent this. 

as physicians have always their instruments and knives ready for cases
which suddenly require their [[skill]], so do thou have principles [[principle]] ready
for the understanding of things [[divine]] and [[human]], and for doing everything,
even the smallest, with a recollection of the bond which unites the
divine and [[human]] to one another. for neither wilt thou do anything
well which pertains to [[man]] without at the same [[time]] having a reference
to things [[divine]]; nor the contrary. 

no longer wander at hazard; for neither wilt thou [[read]] thy own memoirs,
nor the acts of the ancient romans and hellenes, and the selections
from books [[book]] which thou wast reserving for thy old [[age]]. hasten then
to the end which thou hast before thee, and throwing away idle hopes [[hope]],
come to thy own aid, if thou carest at all for thyself, while it is
in thy [[power]]. 

they [[know]] not how many things are signified by the words stealing,
sowing, buying, keeping quiet, seeing what ought to be done; for this
is not effected by the [[eyes]], but by another [[kind]] of vision.

body, [[soul]], [[intelligence]]: to the [[body]] belong sensations, to the soul
appetites, to the [[intelligence]] principles [[principle]]. to receive the impressions
of forms by means of appearances belongs even to animals; to be pulled
by the strings of [[desire]] belongs both to wild beasts and to [[men]] who
have made themselves into [[women]], and to a phalaris and a nero: and
to have the [[intelligence]] that guides to the things which appear suitable
belongs also to those who do not [[believe]] in the gods, and who betray
their [[country]], and do their impure deeds when they have shut the doors.
if then everything else is [[common]] to all that i have mentioned, there
remains that which is peculiar to the [[good]] [[man]], to be pleased and
content with what happens, and with the thread which is spun for him;
and not to defile the divinity which is planted in his breast, nor
disturb it by a crowd of images, but to preserve it tranquil, following
it obediently as a [[god]], neither saying anything contrary to the [[truth]],
nor doing anything contrary to [[justice]]. and if all [[men]] refuse to believe
that he lives [[life]] a simple, modest, and contented [[life]], he is neither
angry with any of them, nor does he deviate from the way which leads
to the end of [[life]], to which a [[man]] ought to come pure, tranquil, ready
to depart, and without any compulsion perfectly reconciled to his
lot.

book four

that which rules [[rule]] within, when it is according to [[nature]], is so affected
with [[respect]] to the events which happen, that it always easily adapts
itself to that which is and is presented to it. for it requires no
definite material, but it moves towards its [[purpose]], under certain
conditions however; and it makes a material for itself out of that
which opposes it, as [[fire]] lays hold of what falls into it, by which
a small [[light]] would have been extinguished: but when the [[fire]] is [[strong]],
it soon appropriates to itself the matter which is heaped on it, and
consumes it, and rises higher by means of this very material.

let no act be done without a [[purpose]], nor otherwise than according
to the [[perfect]] principles [[principle]] of art [[arts]]. 

men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the [[country]], sea-shores,
and mountains; and thou too art [[arts]] wont to [[desire]] such things very much.
but this is altogether a mark of the most [[common]] sort of [[men]], for
it is in thy [[power]] whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself.
for nowhere either with more quiet or more [[freedom]] from trouble does
a [[man]] retire than into his own [[soul]], particularly when he has within
him such thoughts [[thought]] that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect
tranquility; and i affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the
good ordering of the [[mind]]. constantly then give to thyself this retreat,
and renew thyself; and let thy principles [[principle]] be brief and fundamental,
which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to
cleanse the [[soul]] completely, and to send thee back [[free]] from all discontent
with the things to which thou returnest. for with what art [[arts]] thou discontented?
with the badness of [[men]]? recall to thy [[mind]] this conclusion, that
rational animals [[exist]] for one another, and that to endure is a part
of [[justice]], and that [[men]] do [[wrong]] involuntarily; and consider how
many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, [[hatred]], and fighting,
have been stretched [[dead]], reduced to ashes; and be quiet at [[last]].-
but perhaps thou art [[arts]] dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee
out of the [[universe]].- recall to thy recollection this alternative;
either there is providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of things;
or [[remember]] the arguments by which it has been proved that the world
is a [[kind]] of [[political]] [[community]], and be quiet at [[last]].- but perhaps
corporeal things will still fasten upon thee.- consider then further
that the [[mind]] mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or
violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its
own [[power]], and [[think]] also of all that thou hast heard and assented
to about [[pain]] and [[pleasure]], and be quiet at [[last]].- but perhaps the
desire of the thing called fame will torment thee.- see how soon everything
is forgotten, and look at the [[chaos]] of infinite [[time]] on each side
of the [[present]], and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness
and want of judgement in those who pretend to give [[praise]], and the
narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet
at [[last]]. for the whole [[earth]] is a point, and how small a nook in it
is this thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what [[kind]] of
people are they who will [[praise]] thee. 

this then remains: [[remember]] to retire into this little territory of
thy own, and above all do not distract or strain thyself, but be [[free]],
and look at things as a [[man]], as a [[human]] being, as a citizen, as a
mortal. but among the things readiest to thy hand to which thou shalt
turn, let there be these, which are two. one is that things do not
touch the [[soul]], for they are external and remain immovable; but our
perturbations come only from the [[opinion]] which is within. the other
is that all these things, which thou seest, [[change]] immediately and
will no longer be; and constantly bear in [[mind]] how many of these changes
thou hast already witnessed. the [[universe]] is transformation: life
is [[opinion]]. 

if our intellectual part is [[common]], the [[reason]] also, in [[respect]] of
which we are [[rational]] beings, is [[common]]: if this is so, [[common]] also
is the [[reason]] which commands us what to do, and what not to do; if
this is so, there is a [[common]] [[law]] also; if this is so, we are fellow-citizens;
if this is so, we are members of some [[political]] [[community]]; if this
is so, the [[world]] is in a manner a [[state]]. for of what other common
political [[community]] will any one say that the whole [[human]] [[race]] are
members? and from thence, from this [[common]] [[political]] [[community]] comes
also our very intellectual faculty and reasoning faculty and our capacity
for [[law]]; or whence do they come? for as my earthly part is a portion
given to me from [[certain]] [[earth]], and that which is watery from another
element, and that which is hot and fiery from some peculiar source
(for nothing comes out of that which is nothing, as nothing also returns
to non-existence), so also the intellectual part comes from some source.

death is such as [[generation]] is, a mystery of [[nature]]; a composition
out of the same elements, and a decomposition into the same; and altogether
not a thing of which any [[man]] should be ashamed, for it is not contrary
to the [[nature]] of a reasonable animal, and not contrary to the reason
of our [[constitution]]. 

it is [[natural]] that these things should be done by such persons [[person]], it
is a matter of necessity; and if a [[man]] will not have it so, he will
not allow the fig-tree to have juice. but by all means bear this in
mind, that within a very short [[time]] both thou and he will be [[dead]];
and soon not even your names will be left behind. 

take away thy [[opinion]], and then there is taken away the complaint,
"i have been harmed." take away the complaint, "i have been harmed,"
and the harm is taken away. 

that which does not make a [[man]] worse than he was, also does not make
his [[life]] worse, nor does it harm him either from without or from within.

the [[nature]] of that which is universally useful has been compelled
to do this. 

consider that everything which happens, happens justly, and if thou
observest carefully, thou wilt find it to be so. i do not say only
with [[respect]] to the continuity of the series of things, but with respect
to what is just, and as if it were done by one who assigns to each
thing its value. observe then as thou hast begun; and whatever thou
doest, do it in conjunction with this, the being [[good]], and in the
sense in which a [[man]] is properly understood to be [[good]]. keep to this
in every action. 

do not have such an [[opinion]] of things as he has who does thee [[wrong]],
or such as he wishes [[wish]] thee to have, but look at them as they are in
truth. 

a [[man]] should always have these two rules [[rule]] in readiness; the one, to
do only whatever the [[reason]] of the ruling and legislating faculty
may suggest for the use of [[men]]; the other, to [[change]] thy [[opinion]],
if there is any one at hand who sets thee [[right]] and moves thee from
any [[opinion]]. but this [[change]] of [[opinion]] must proceed only from a certain
persuasion, as of what is just or of [[common]] advantage, and the like,
not because it appears pleasant or brings [[reputation]]. 

hast thou [[reason]]? i have.- why then dost not thou use it? for if this
does its own [[work]], what else dost thou [[wish]]? 

thou hast existed as a part. thou shalt disappear in that which produced
thee; but rather thou shalt be received back into its seminal principle
by transmutation. 

many grains of frankincense on the same altar: one falls before, another
falls after; but it makes no difference. 

within ten days thou wilt seem a [[god]] to those to whom thou art [[arts]] now
a beast and an ape, if thou wilt return to thy principles [[principle]] and the
worship of [[reason]]. 

do not act as if thou wert going to [[live]] ten thousand years. death
hangs over thee. while thou livest, while it is in thy [[power]], be [[good]].

how much trouble he avoids who does not look to see what his neighbour
says or does or thinks [[think]], but only to what he does himself, that it
may be just and pure; or as agathon says, look not round at the depraved
morals of others, but run straight along the line without deviating
from it. 

he who has a vehement [[desire]] for posthumous fame does not consider
that every one of those who [[remember]] him will himself also [[die]] very
soon; then again also they who have succeeded them, until the whole
remembrance shall have been extinguished as it is transmitted through
men who foolishly [[admire]] and perish. but suppose that those who will
remember are even [[immortal]], and that the remembrance will be [[immortal]],
what then is this to thee? and i say not what is it to the [[dead]], but
what is it to the living? what is [[praise]] except indeed so far as it
has a [[certain]] utility? for thou now rejectest unseasonably the gift
of [[nature]], clinging to something else... 

everything which is in any way beautiful is beautiful in itself, and
terminates in itself, not having [[praise]] as part of itself. neither
worse then nor [[better]] is a thing made by being praised. i affirm this
also of the things which are called beautiful by the vulgar, for [[example]],
material things and works [[work]] of art [[arts]]. that which is really beautiful has
no need of anything; not more than [[law]], not more than [[truth]], not more
than benevolence or modesty. which of these things is beautiful because
it is praised, or spoiled by being blamed? is such a thing as an emerald
made worse than it was, if it is not praised? or gold, ivory, purple,
a lyre, a little knife, a flower, a shrub? 

if souls [[soul]] continue to [[exist]], how does the air contain them from eternity?-
but how does the [[earth]] contain the bodies [[body]] of those who have been buried
from [[time]] so remote? for as here the mutation of these bodies [[body]] after
a [[certain]] continuance, whatever it may be, and their dissolution make
room for other [[dead]] bodies [[body]]; so the souls [[soul]] which are removed into the
air after subsisting for some [[time]] are transmuted and diffused, and
assume a fiery [[nature]] by being received into the seminal intelligence
of the [[universe]], and in this way make room for the fresh souls [[soul]] which
come to dwell there. and this is the [[answer]] which a [[man]] might give
on the hypothesis of souls [[soul]] continuing to [[exist]]. but we must not only
think of the number of bodies [[body]] which are thus buried, but also of the
number of animals which are daily eaten by us and the other animals.
for what a number is consumed, and thus in a manner buried in the
bodies of those who feed on them! and nevertheless this [[earth]] receives
them by [[reason]] of the changes [[change]] of these bodies [[body]] into [[blood]], and the
transformations into the aerial or the fiery element. 

what is the investigation into the [[truth]] in this matter? the division
into that which is material and that which is the cause of form, the
formal. 

do not be whirled about, but in every movement have [[respect]] to [[justice]],
and on the [[occasion]] of every impression maintain the faculty of comprehension
or understanding. 

everything harmonizes with me, which is harmonious to thee, o [[universe]].
nothing for me is too early nor too late, which is in due [[time]] for
thee. everything is fruit to me which thy seasons bring, o [[nature]]:
from thee are all things, in thee are all things, to thee all things
return. the poet says, dear [[city]] of cecrops; and wilt not thou say,
dear [[city]] of [[zeus]]? 

occupy thyself with few things, says the philosopher, if thou wouldst
be tranquil.- but consider if it would not be [[better]] to say, do what
is necessary, and whatever the [[reason]] of the animal which is naturally
social requires, and as it requires. for this brings not only the
tranquility which comes from doing well, but also that which comes
from doing few things. for the [[greatest]] part of what we say and do
being unnecessary, if a [[man]] takes this away, he will have more leisure
and less uneasiness. accordingly on every [[occasion]] a [[man]] should ask
himself, is this one of the unnecessary things? now a [[man]] should take
away not only unnecessary acts, but also, unnecessary thoughts [[thought]], for
thus superfluous acts will not [[follow]] after. 

try how the [[life]] of the [[good]] [[man]] suits thee, the [[life]] of him who is
satisfied with his portion out of the whole, and satisfied with his
own just acts and benevolent disposition. 

hast thou seen those things? look also at these. do not disturb thyself.
make thyself all simplicity. does any one do [[wrong]]? it is to himself
that he does the [[wrong]]. has anything happened to thee? well; out of
the [[universe]] from the beginning everything which happens has been
apportioned and spun out to thee. in a word, thy [[life]] is short. thou
must turn to [[profit]] the [[present]] by the aid of [[reason]] and [[justice]].
be sober in thy relaxation. 

either it is a well-arranged [[universe]] or a [[chaos]] huddled together,
but still a [[universe]]. but can a [[certain]] order subsist in thee, and
disorder in the all? and this too when all things are so separated
and diffused and sympathetic. 

a black [[character]], a womanish [[character]], a stubborn [[character]], bestial,
childish, animal, stupid, counterfeit, scurrilous, fraudulent, [[tyrannical]].

if he is a stranger to the [[universe]] who does not [[know]] what is in it,
no less is he a stranger who does not [[know]] what is going on in it.
he is a runaway, who flies from social [[reason]]; he is blind, who shuts
the [[eyes]] of the understanding; he is [[poor]], who has need of another,
and has not from himself all things which are useful for [[life]]. he
is an abscess on the [[universe]] who withdraws and separates himself
from the [[reason]] of our [[common]] [[nature]] through being displeased with
the things which happen, for the same [[nature]] produces [[produce]] this, and has
produced thee too: he is a piece rent asunder from the [[state]], who
tears his own [[soul]] from that of reasonable animals, which is one.

the one is a philosopher without a tunic, and the other without a
book: here is another half naked: bread i have not, he says, and i
abide by [[reason]].- and i do not get the means of living out of my learning,
and i abide by my [[reason]]. 

love the art [[arts]], [[poor]] as it may be, which thou hast learned, and be content
with it; and pass through the rest of [[life]] like one who has intrusted
to the gods with his whole [[soul]] all that he has, making thyself neither
the [[tyrant]] nor the [[slave]] of any [[man]]. 

consider, for [[example]], the times [[time]] of vespasian. thou wilt see all these
things, [[people]] marrying, bringing up [[children]], sick, dying, warring,
feasting, trafficking, cultivating the ground, flattering, obstinately
arrogant, suspecting, plotting, wishing for some to [[die]], grumbling
about the [[present]], loving, heaping up treasure, desiring counsulship,
kingly [[power]]. well then, that [[life]] of these [[people]] no longer exists
at all. again, remove to the times [[time]] of trajan. again, all is the same.
their [[life]] too is gone. in like manner view also the other epochs
of [[time]] and of whole nations, and see how many after [[great]] efforts
soon fell and were resolved into the elements. but chiefly thou shouldst
think of those whom thou hast thyself known distracting themselves
about idle things, neglecting to do what was in accordance with their
proper [[constitution]], and to hold firmly to this and to be content
with it. and herein it is necessary to [[remember]] that the attention
given to everything has its proper value and proportion. for thus
thou wilt not be dissatisfied, if thou appliest thyself to smaller
matters no further than is fit. 

the words which were formerly familiar are now antiquated: so also
the names of those who were famed of old, are now in a manner antiquated,
camillus, caeso, volesus, leonnatus, and a little after also scipio
and cato, then augustus, then also hadrian and antoninus. for all
things soon pass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion
soon buries them. and i say this of those who have shone in a wondrous
way. for the rest, as soon as they have breathed out their breath,
they are gone, and no [[man]] speaks of them. and, to conclude the matter,
what is even an eternal remembrance? a mere nothing. what then is
that about which we ought to employ our serious pains [[pain]]? this one thing,
thoughts just, and acts social, and words which never [[lie]], and a disposition
which gladly accepts all that happens, as necessary, as usual, as
flowing from a [[principle]] and source of the same [[kind]]. 

willingly give thyself up to clotho, one of the fates [[fate]], allowing her
to spin thy thread into whatever things she pleases. 

everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which
is remembered. 

observe constantly that all things take place by [[change]], and accustom
thyself to consider that the [[nature]] of the [[universe]] loves [[love]] nothing
so much as to [[change]] the things which are and to make new things like
them. for everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which
will be. but thou art [[arts]] thinking only of seeds which are cast into the
earth or into a womb: but this is a very vulgar notion. 

thou wilt soon [[die]], and thou art [[arts]] not yet simple, not [[free]] from perturbations,
nor without suspicion of being hurt by external things, nor kindly
disposed towards all; nor dost thou yet place [[wisdom]] only in acting
justly. 

examine men's ruling principles [[principle]], even those of the [[wise]], what kind
of things they avoid, and what [[kind]] they pursue. 

what is [[evil]] to thee does not subsist in the ruling [[principle]] of another;
nor yet in any turning and mutation of thy corporeal covering. where
is it then? it is in that part of thee in which subsists the power
of forming opinions [[opinion]] about evils [[evil]]. let this [[power]] then not form such
opinions, and all is well. and if that which is nearest to it, the
poor [[body]], is burnt, filled with matter and rottenness, nevertheless
let the part which forms opinions [[opinion]] about these things be quiet, that
is, let it [[judge]] that nothing is either [[bad]] or [[good]] which can happen
equally to the [[bad]] [[man]] and the [[good]]. for that which happens equally
to him who lives [[life]] contrary to [[nature]] and to him who lives [[life]] according
to [[nature]], is neither according to [[nature]] nor contrary to [[nature]].

constantly regard the [[universe]] as one living being, having one substance
and one [[soul]]; and observe how all things have reference to one perception,
the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with
one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all
things which [[exist]]; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread
and the contexture of the web. 

thou art [[arts]] a little [[soul]] bearing about a corpse, as epictetus used to
say. 

it is no [[evil]] for things to undergo [[change]], and no [[good]] for things
to subsist in consequence of [[change]]. 

time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent
stream; for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is carried away,
and another comes in its place, and this will be carried away too.

everything which happens is as familiar and well known as the rose
in spring and the fruit in summer; for such is disease, and [[death]],
and calumny, and treachery, and whatever else delights fools [[fool]] or vexes
them. 

in the series of things those which [[follow]] are always aptly fitted
to those which have gone before; for this series is not like a mere
enumeration of disjointed things, which has only a necessary sequence,
but it is a [[rational]] connection: and as all existing things are arranged
together harmoniously, so the things which come into existence exhibit
no mere succession, but a [[certain]] wonderful relationship.

always [[remember]] the saying of heraclitus, that the [[death]] of earth
is to become water, and the [[death]] of water is to become air, and the
death of air is to become [[fire]], and reversely. and [[think]] too of him
who forgets whither the way leads, and that [[men]] quarrel with that
with which they are most constantly in communion, the [[reason]] which
governs the [[universe]]; and the things which daily meet with seem to
them [[strange]]: and consider that we ought not to act and speak as if
we were asleep, for even in sleep we seem to act and speak; and that
we ought not, like [[children]] who learn from their parents, simply to
act and speak as we have been taught. 

if any [[god]] told thee that thou shalt [[die]] to-morrow, or certainly on
the day after to-morrow, thou wouldst not [[care]] much whether it was
on the third day or on the morrow, unless thou wast in the highest
degree mean-spirited- for how small is the difference?- so [[think]] it
no [[great]] thing to [[die]] after as many years as thou canst name rather
than to-morrow. 

think continually how many physicians are [[dead]] after often contracting
their eyebrows over the sick; and how many astrologers after predicting
with [[great]] pretensions the deaths [[death]] of others; and how many philosophers
after endless discourses on [[death]] or immortality; how many heroes
after killing thousands; and how many tyrants [[tyrant]] who have used their
power over men's lives [[life]] with terrible insolence as if they were [[immortal]];
and how many cities [[city]] are entirely [[dead]], so to speak, helice and pompeii
and herculaneum, and others innumerable. add to the reckoning all
whom thou hast known, one after another. one [[man]] after burying another
has been laid out [[dead]], and another buries him: and all this in a
short [[time]]. to conclude, always observe how ephemeral and worthless
human things are, and what was yesterday a little mucus to-morrow
will be a mummy or ashes. pass then through this little space of time
conformably to [[nature]], and end thy [[journey]] in content, just as an
olive falls off when it is ripe, blessing [[nature]] who produced it,
and thanking the tree on which it grew. 

be like the promontory against which the waves continually break,
but it stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it.

unhappy am i because this has happened to me.- not so, but [[happy]] am
i, though this has happened to me, because i continue [[free]] from [[pain]],
neither crushed by the [[present]] nor fearing the future. for such a
thing as this might have happened to every [[man]]; but every [[man]] would
not have continued [[free]] from [[pain]] on such an [[occasion]]. why then is
that rather a misfortune than this a [[good]] [[fortune]]? and dost thou in
all cases call that a man's [[man]] misfortune, which is not a deviation from
man's [[nature]]? and does a thing seem to thee to be a deviation from
man's [[nature]], when it is not contrary to the will of man's [[man]] [[nature]]?
well, thou knowest the will of [[nature]]. will then this which has happened
prevent thee from being just, magnanimous, temperate, prudent, secure
against inconsiderate opinions [[opinion]] and falsehood; will it prevent thee
from having modesty, [[freedom]], and everything else, by the presence
of which man's [[man]] [[nature]] obtains all that is its own? [[remember]] too on
every [[occasion]] which leads thee to vexation to apply this [[principle]]:
not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is [[good]] [[fortune]].

it is a vulgar, but still a useful [[help]] towards contempt of [[death]],
to pass in review those who have tenaciously stuck to [[life]]. what more
then have they gained than those who have died early? certainly they
lie in their tombs somewhere at [[last]], cadicianus, fabius, julianus,
lepidus, or any one else like them, who have carried out many to be
buried, and then were carried out themselves. altogether the interval
is small between birth and [[death]]; and consider with how much trouble,
and in company with what sort of [[people]] and in what a feeble body
this interval is laboriously passed. do not then consider [[life]] a thing
of any value. for look to the immensity of [[time]] behind thee, and to
the [[time]] which is before thee, another boundless space. in this infinity
then what is the difference between him who lives [[life]] three days and him
who lives [[life]] three generations [[generation]]? 

always run to the short way; and the short way is the [[natural]]: accordingly
say and do everything in conformity with the soundest [[reason]]. for
such a [[purpose]] frees a [[man]] from trouble, and warfare, and all artifice
and ostentatious display.

book five

in he morning when thou risest unwillingly, let this [[thought]] be present-
i am rising to the [[work]] of a [[human]] being. why then am i dissatisfied
if i am going to do the things for which i [[exist]] and for which i was
brought into the [[world]]? or have i been made for this, to [[lie]] in the
bed-clothes and keep myself warm?- but this is more pleasant.- dost
thou [[exist]] then to take thy [[pleasure]], and not at all for action or
exertion? dost thou not see the little plants, the little birds, the
ants, the spiders, the bees working together to put in order their
several parts of the [[universe]]? and art [[arts]] thou unwilling to do the work
of a [[human]] being, and dost thou not make haste to do that which is
according to thy [[nature]]?- but it is necessary to take rest also.-
it is necessary: however [[nature]] has fixed bounds to this too: she
has fixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet thou goest beyond
these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in thy acts it is not
so, but thou stoppest short of what thou canst do. so thou lovest
not thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst [[love]] thy [[nature]] and her
will. but those who [[love]] their several [[arts]] exhaust themselves in
working at them unwashed and without food; but thou valuest thy own
own [[nature]] less than the turner values the turning art [[arts]], or the dancer
the dancing art [[arts]], or the lover of [[money]] values his [[money]], or the vainglorious
man his little [[glory]]. and such [[men]], when they have a [[violent]] affection
to a thing, choose neither to [[eat]] nor to sleep rather than to perfect
the things which they [[care]] for. but are the acts which concern society
more vile in thy [[eyes]] and less worthy of thy [[labour]]? 

how easy it is to repel and to wipe away every impression which is
troublesome or unsuitable, and immediately to be in all tranquility.

judge every word and deed which are according to [[nature]] to be fit
for thee; and be not diverted by the blame which follows from any
people nor by their words, but if a thing is [[good]] to be done or said,
do not consider it unworthy of thee. for those persons [[person]] have their
peculiar leading [[principle]] and [[follow]] their peculiar movement; which
things do not thou regard, but go straight on, following thy own nature
and the [[common]] [[nature]]; and the way of both is one. 

i go through the things which happen according to [[nature]] until i shall
fall and rest, breathing out my breath into that element out of which
i daily draw it in, and falling upon that [[earth]] out of which my father
collected the seed, and my [[mother]] the [[blood]], and my nurse the milk;
out of which during so many years i have been supplied with food and
drink; which bears me when i tread on it and [[abuse]] it for so many
purposes. 

thou sayest, [[men]] cannot [[admire]] the sharpness of thy wits.- be it so:
but there are many other things of which thou canst not say, i am
not formed for them by [[nature]]. show those qualities then which are
altogether in thy [[power]], sincerity, gravity, endurance of [[labour]],
aversion to [[pleasure]], contentment with thy portion and with few things,
benevolence, frankness, no [[love]] of superfluity, [[freedom]] from trifling
magnanimity. dost thou not see how many qualities thou art [[arts]] immediately
able to exhibit, in which there is no excuse of [[natural]] incapacity
and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest voluntarily below the
mark? or art [[arts]] thou compelled through being defectively furnished by
nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to flatter, and to find fault
with thy [[poor]] [[body]], and to try to please [[men]], and to make [[great]] display,
and to be so restless in thy [[mind]]? no, by the gods: but thou mightest
have been delivered from these things long ago. only if in [[truth]] thou
canst be charged with being rather slow and dull of comprehension,
thou must exert thyself about this also, not neglecting it nor yet
taking [[pleasure]] in thy dulness. 

one [[man]], when he has done a service to another, is ready to set it
down to his account as a favour conferred. another is not ready to
do this, but still in his own [[mind]] he thinks [[think]] of the [[man]] as his debtor,
and he knows [[know]] what he has done. a third in a manner does not even know
what he has done, but he is like a vine which has produced grapes,
and seeks for nothing more after it has once produced its proper fruit.
as a horse when he has run, a dog when he has tracked the game, a
bee when it has made the honey, so a [[man]] when he has done a [[good]] act,
does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another
act, as a vine goes on to [[produce]] again the grapes in season.- must
a [[man]] then be one of these, who in a manner act thus without observing
it?- yes.- but this very thing is necessary, the observation of what
a [[man]] is doing: for, it may be said, it is characteristic of the social
animal to perceive that he is working in a social manner, and indeed
to [[wish]] that his social partner also should perceive it.- it is true
what thou sayest, but thou dost not rightly [[understand]] what is now
said: and for this [[reason]] thou wilt become one of those of whom i
spoke before, for even they are misled by a [[certain]] show of [[reason]].
but if thou wilt choose to [[understand]] the meaning of what is said,
do not [[fear]] that for this [[reason]] thou wilt omit any social act.

a prayer of the athenians: rain, rain, o dear [[zeus]], down on the ploughed
fields of the athenians and on the plains.- in [[truth]] we ought not
to [[pray]] at all, or we ought to [[pray]] in this simple and [[noble]] [[fashion]].

just as we must [[understand]] when it is said, that aesculapius prescribed
to this [[man]] horse-exercise, or bathing in cold water or going without
shoes; so we must [[understand]] it when it is said, that the [[nature]] of
the [[universe]] prescribed to this [[man]] disease or mutilation or loss
or anything else of the [[kind]]. for in the first case prescribed means
something like this: he prescribed this for this [[man]] as a thing adapted
to procure health; and in the second case it means: that which happens
to (or, suits) every [[man]] is fixed in a manner for him suitably to
his [[destiny]]. for this is what we mean when we say that things are
suitable to us, as the workmen say of squared stones in walls or the
pyramids, that they are suitable, when they fit them to one another
in some [[kind]] of connexion. for there is altogether one fitness, harmony.
and as the [[universe]] is made up out of all bodies [[body]] to be such a body
as it is, so out of all existing causes necessity (destiny) is made
up to be such a cause as it is. and even those who are completely
ignorant [[understand]] what i mean, for they say, it (necessity, destiny)
brought this to such a [[person]].- this then was brought and this was
precribed to him. let us then receive these things, as well as those
which aesculapius prescribes. many as a matter of course even among
his prescriptions are disagreeable, but we accept them in the hope
of health. let the perfecting and accomplishment of the things, which
the [[common]] [[nature]] judges [[judge]] to be [[good]], be judged by thee to be of the
same [[kind]] as thy health. and so accept everything which happens, even
if it seem disagreeable, because it leads to this, to the health of
the [[universe]] and to the [[prosperity]] and felicity of [[zeus]] (the universe).
for he would not have brought on any [[man]] what he has brought, if it
were not useful for the whole. neither does the [[nature]] of anything,
whatever it may be, cause anything which is not suitable to that which
is directed by it. for two reasons [[reason]] then it is [[right]] to be content
with that which happens to thee; the one, because it was done for
thee and prescribed for thee, and in a manner had reference to thee,
originally from the most ancient causes spun with thy [[destiny]]; and
the other, because even that which comes severally to every [[man]] is
to the [[power]] which administers the [[universe]] a cause of felicity and
perfection, nay even of its very continuance. for the integrity of
the whole is mutilated, if thou cuttest off anything whatever from
the conjunction and the continuity either of the parts or of the causes.
and thou dost cut off, as far as it is in thy [[power]], when thou art
dissatisfied, and in a manner triest to put anything out of the way.

be not disgusted, nor discouraged, nor dissatisfied, if thou dost
not succeed in doing everything according to [[right]] principles [[principle]]; but
when thou bast failed, return back again, and be content if the greater
part of what thou doest is consistent with man's [[man]] [[nature]], and love
this to which thou returnest; and do not return to [[philosophy]] as if
she were a master, but act like those who have sore [[eyes]] and apply
a bit of sponge and egg, or as another applies a plaster, or drenching
with water. for thus thou wilt not fail to obey [[reason]], and thou wilt
repose in it. and [[remember]] that [[philosophy]] requires only the things
which thy [[nature]] requires; but thou wouldst have something else which
is not according to [[nature]].- it may be objected, why what is more
agreeable than this which i am doing?- but is not this the very reason
why [[pleasure]] deceives us? and consider if magnanimity, [[freedom]], simplicity,
equanimity, piety, are not more agreeable. for what is more agreeable
than [[wisdom]] itself, when thou thinkest of the security and the happy
course of all things which depend on the faculty of understanding
and [[knowledge]]? 

things are in such a [[kind]] of envelopment that they have seemed to
philosophers, not a few nor those [[common]] [[philosophers]], altogether
unintelligible; nay even to the stoics themselves they seem difficult
to [[understand]]. and all our assent is changeable; for where is the
man who never changes [[change]]? carry thy thoughts [[thought]] then to the objects themselves,
and consider how short-lived they are and worthless, and that they
may be in the possession of a filthy wretch or a whore or a robber.
then turn to the morals [[moral]] of those who [[live]] with thee, and it is hardly
possible to endure even the most agreeable of them, to say nothing
of a [[man]] being hardly able to endure himself. in such darkness then
and dirt and in so constant a flux both of substance and of [[time]],
and of motion and of things moved, what there is worth being highly
prized or even an object of serious pursuit, i cannot imagine. but
on the contrary it is a man's [[man]] [[duty]] to comfort himself, and to wait
for the 

natural dissolution and not to be vexed at the delay, but to rest
in these principles [[principle]] only: the one, that nothing will happen to me
which is not conformable to the [[nature]] of the [[universe]]; and the other,
that it is in my [[power]] never to act contrary to my [[god]] and daemon:
for there is no [[man]] who will compel me to this. 

about what am i now employing my own [[soul]]? on every [[occasion]] i must
ask myself this [[question]], and inquire, what have i now in this part
of me which they call the ruling [[principle]]? and whose [[soul]] have i
now? that of a child, or of a [[young]] [[man]], or of a feeble woman, or
of a [[tyrant]], or of a domestic animal, or of a wild beast?

what [[kind]] of things those are which appear [[good]] to the many, we may
learn even from this. for if any [[man]] should conceive [[certain]] things
as being really [[good]], such as prudence, temperance, [[justice]], fortitude,
he would not after having first conceived these endure to listen to
anything which should not be in harmony with what is really [[good]].
but if a [[man]] has first conceived as [[good]] the things which appear to
the many to be [[good]], he will listen and readily receive as very applicable
that which was said by the comic writer. thus even the many perceive
the difference. for were it not so, this saying would not offend and
would not be rejected in the first case, while we receive it when
it is said of [[wealth]], and of the means which further luxury and fame,
as said fitly and wittily. go on then and ask if we should value and
think those things to be [[good]], to which after their first conception
in the [[mind]] the words of the comic writer might be aptly applied-
that he who has them, through pure abundance has not a place to ease
himself in. 

i am composed of the formal and the material; and neither of them
will perish into non-existence, as neither of them came into existence
out of non-existence. every part of me then will be reduced by change
into some part of the [[universe]], and that again will [[change]] into another
part of the [[universe]], and so on for ever. and by consequence of such
a [[change]] i too [[exist]], and those who begot me, and so on for ever in
the other direction. for nothing hinders us from saying so, even if
the [[universe]] is administered according to definite periods of [[revolution]].

reason and the reasoning art [[arts]] (philosophy) are powers [[power]] which are sufficient
for themselves and for their own works [[work]]. they move then from a first
principle which is their own, and they make their way to the end which
is proposed to them; and this is the [[reason]] why such acts are named
catorthoseis or [[right]] acts, which word signifies that they proceed
by the [[right]] road. 

none of these things ought to be called a man's [[man]], which do not belong
to a [[man]], as [[man]]. they are not required of a [[man]], nor does man's [[man]] nature
promise them, nor are they the means of man's [[man]] [[nature]] attaining its
end. neither then does the end of [[man]] [[lie]] in these things, nor yet
that which aids to the accomplishment of this end, and that which
aids towards this end is that which is [[good]]. besides, if any of these
things did belong to [[man]], it would not be [[right]] for a [[man]] to despise
them and to set himself against them; nor would a [[man]] be worthy of
praise who showed that he did not want these things, nor would he
who stinted himself in any of them be [[good]], if indeed these things
were [[good]]. but now the more of these things a [[man]] deprives himself
of, or of other things like them, or even when he is deprived of any
of them, the more patiently he endures the loss, just in the same
degree he is a [[better]] [[man]]. 

such as are thy habitual thoughts [[thought]], such also will be the character
of thy [[mind]]; for the [[soul]] is dyed by the thoughts [[thought]]. dye it then with
a continuous series of such thoughts [[thought]] as these: for instance, that
where a [[man]] can [[live]], there he can also [[live]] well. but he must live
in a palace;- well then, he can also [[live]] well in a palace. and again,
consider that for whatever [[purpose]] each thing has been constituted,
for this it has been constituted, and towards this it is carried;
and its end is in that towards which it is carried; and where the
end is, there also is the advantage and the [[good]] of each thing. now
the [[good]] for the reasonable animal is [[society]]; for that we are made
for [[society]] has been shown above. is it not plain that the inferior
exist for the sake of the superior? but the things which have life
are superior to those which have not [[life]], and of those which have
life the superior are those which have [[reason]]. 

to seek what is impossible is madness: and it is impossible that the
bad should not do something of this [[kind]]. 

nothing happens to any [[man]] which he is not formed by [[nature]] to bear.
the same things happen to another, and either because he does not
see that they have happened or because he would show a [[great]] spirit
he is firm and remains unharmed. it is a shame then that ignorance
and conceit should be stronger than [[wisdom]]. 

things themselves touch not the [[soul]], not in the least [[degree]]; nor
have they admission to the [[soul]], nor can they turn or move the [[soul]]:
but the [[soul]] turns and moves itself alone, and whatever judgements
it may [[think]] proper to make, such it makes for itself the things which
present themselves to it. 

in one [[respect]] [[man]] is the nearest thing to me, so far as i must do
good to [[men]] and endure them. but so far as some [[men]] make themselves
obstacles to my proper acts, [[man]] becomes to me one of the things which
are indifferent, no less than the sun or wind or a wild beast. now
it is true that these may impede my action, but they are no impediments
to my affects and disposition, which have the [[power]] of acting conditionally
and changing: for the [[mind]] converts and changes [[change]] every hindrance to
its activity into an aid; and so that which is a hindrance is made
a furtherance to an act; and that which is an obstacle on the road
helps us on this road. 

reverence that which is [[best]] in the [[universe]]; and this is that which
makes use of all things and directs all things. and in like manner
also reverence that which is [[best]] in thyself; and this is of the same
kind as that. for in thyself also, that which makes use of everything
else, is this, and thy [[life]] is directed by this. 

that which does no harm to the [[state]], does no harm to the citizen.
in the case of every appearance of harm apply this [[rule]]: if the state
is not harmed by this, neither am i harmed. but if the [[state]] is harmed,
thou must not be angry with him who does harm to the [[state]]. show him
where his error is. 

often [[think]] of the rapidity with which things pass by and disappear,
both the things which are and the things which are produced. for substance
is like a river in a continual flow, and the activities of things
are in constant [[change]], and the causes [[work]] in infinite varieties;
and there is hardly anything which stands still. and consider this
which is near to thee, this boundless abyss of the [[past]] and of the
future in which all things disappear. how then is he not a [[fool]] who
is puffed up with such things or plagued about them and makes himself
miserable? for they vex him only for a [[time]], and a short [[time]].

think of the universal substance, of which thou hast a very small
portion; and of universal [[time]], of which a short and indivisible interval
has been assigned to thee; and of that which is fixed by [[destiny]],
and how small a part of it thou art [[arts]]. 

does another do me [[wrong]]? let him look to it. he has his own disposition,
his own activity. i now have what the universal [[nature]] wills me to
have; and i do what my [[nature]] now wills me to do. 

let the part of thy [[soul]] which leads and governs be undisturbed by
the movements in the flesh, whether of [[pleasure]] or of [[pain]]; and let
it not unite with them, but let it circumscribe itself and limit those
affects to their parts. but when these affects rise up to the mind
by [[virtue]] of that other sympathy that naturally exists in a [[body]] which
is all one, then thou must not strive to resist the sensation, for
it is [[natural]]: but let not the ruling part of itself add to the sensation
the [[opinion]] that it is either [[good]] or [[bad]]. 

live with the gods. and he does [[live]] with the gods who constantly
shows to them, his own [[soul]] is satisfied with that which is assigned
to him, and that it does all that the daemon wishes [[wish]], which [[zeus]] hath
given to every [[man]] for his guardian and guide, a portion of himself.
and this is every man's [[man]] understanding and [[reason]]. 

art thou angry with him whose armpits stink? art [[arts]] thou angry with him
whose mouth smells foul? what [[good]] will this danger do thee? he has
such a mouth, he has such arm-pits: it is necessary that such an emanation
must come from such things- but the [[man]] has [[reason]], it will be said,
and he is able, if he takes [[pain]], to discover wherein he offends-
i [[wish]] thee well of thy discovery. well then, and thou hast [[reason]]:
by thy [[rational]] faculty stir up his [[rational]] faculty; show him his
error, admonish him. for if he listens, thou wilt cure him, and there
is no need of anger. neither tragic actor nor whore... 

as thou intendest to [[live]] when thou art [[arts]] gone out,...so it is in thy
power to [[live]] here. but if [[men]] do not permit thee, then get away out
of [[life]], yet so as if thou wert suffering no harm. the house is smoky,
and i quit it. why dost thou [[think]] that this is any trouble? but so
long as nothing of the [[kind]] drives me out, i remain, am [[free]], and
no [[man]] shall hinder me from doing what i choose; and i choose to do
what is according to the [[nature]] of the [[rational]] and social animal.

the [[intelligence]] of the [[universe]] is social. accordingly it has made
the inferior things for the sake of the superior, and it has fitted
the superior to one another. thou seest how it has subordinated, co-ordinated
and assigned to everything its proper portion, and has brought together
into concord with one another the things which are the [[best]].

how hast thou behaved hitherto to the gods, thy parents, brethren [[brother]],
children, teachers, to those who looked after thy infancy, to thy
friends, kinsfolk, to thy slaves [[slave]]? consider if thou hast hitherto behaved
to all in such a way that this may be said of thee: 

never has wronged a [[man]] in deed or word. and call to recollection
both how many things thou hast passed through, and how many things
thou hast been able to endure: and that the [[history]] of thy [[life]] is
now complete and thy service is ended: and how many beautiful things
thou hast seen: and how many pleasures [[pleasure]] and pains [[pain]] thou hast despised;
and how many things called honourable thou hast spurned; and to how
many ill-minded folks thou hast shown a [[kind]] disposition.

why do unskilled and ignorant souls [[soul]] disturb him who has [[skill]] and
knowledge? what [[soul]] then has [[skill]] and [[knowledge]]? that which knows
beginning and end, and knows [[know]] the [[reason]] which pervades all substance
and through all [[time]] by fixed periods (revolutions) administers the
universe. 

soon, very soon, thou wilt be ashes, or a skeleton, and either a name
or not even a name; but name is sound and echo. and the things which
are much valued in [[life]] are empty and rotten and trifling, and like
little dogs biting one another, and little [[children]] quarrelling, laughing,
and then straightway weeping. but fidelity and modesty and justice
and [[truth]] are fled 

up to [[olympus]] from the wide-spread [[earth]]. what then is there which
still detains thee here? if the objects of sense are easily changed
and never stand still, and the organs of perception are dull and easily
receive false impressions; and the [[poor]] [[soul]] itself is an exhalation
from [[blood]]. but to have [[good]] repute amidst such a [[world]] as this is
an empty thing. why then dost thou not wait in tranquility for thy
end, whether it is extinction or removal to another [[state]]? and until
that [[time]] comes, what is sufficient? why, what else than to venerate
the gods and bless them, and to do [[good]] to [[men]], and to practise tolerance
and self-restraint; but as to everything which is beyond the limits
of the [[poor]] flesh and breath, to [[remember]] that this is neither thine
nor in thy [[power]]. 

thou canst pass thy [[life]] in an equable flow of [[happiness]], if thou
canst go by the [[right]] way, and [[think]] and act in the [[right]] way. these
two things are [[common]] both to the [[soul]] of [[god]] and to the [[soul]] of [[man]],
and to the [[soul]] of every [[rational]] being, not to be hindered by another;
and to hold [[good]] to consist in the disposition to [[justice]] and the
practice of it, and in this to let thy [[desire]] find its termination.

if this is neither my own badness, nor an effect of my own badness,
and the [[common]] weal is not injured, why am i troubled about it? and
what is the harm to the [[common]] weal? 

do not be carried along inconsiderately by the appearance of things,
but give [[help]] to all according to thy ability and their fitness; and
if they should have sustained loss in matters which are indifferent,
do not imagine this to be a damage. for it is a [[bad]] habit. but as
the old [[man]], when he went away, [[asked]] back his foster-child's top,
remembering that it was a top, so do thou in this case also.

when thou art [[arts]] calling out on the rostra, hast thou forgotten, [[man]],
what these things are?- yes; but they are objects of [[great]] concern
to these people- wilt thou too then be made a [[fool]] for these things?-
i was once a fortunate [[man]], but i lost it, i [[know]] not how.- but fortunate
means that a [[man]] has assigned to himself a [[good]] [[fortune]]: and a good
fortune is [[good]] disposition of the [[soul]], [[good]] emotions, [[good]] actions.

book six

the substance of the [[universe]] is [[obedient]] and compliant; and the
reason which governs it has in itself no cause for doing [[evil]], for
it has no malice, nor does it do [[evil]] to anything, nor is anything
harmed by it. but all things are made and perfected according to this
reason. 

let it make no difference to thee whether thou art [[arts]] cold or warm, if
thou art [[arts]] doing thy [[duty]]; and whether thou art [[arts]] drowsy or satisfied
with sleep; and whether ill-spoken of or praised; and whether dying
or doing something else. for it is one of the acts of [[life]], this act
by which we [[die]]: it is sufficient then in this act also to do well
what we have in hand. 

look within. let neither the peculiar quality of anything nor its
value escape thee. 

all existing things soon [[change]], and they will either be reduced to
vapour, if indeed all substance is one, or they will be dispersed.

the [[reason]] which governs knows [[know]] what its own disposition is, and what
it does, and on what material it works [[work]]. 

the [[best]] way of avenging thyself is not to become like the [[wrong]] doer.

take [[pleasure]] in one thing and rest in it, in passing from one social
act to another social act, thinking of [[god]]. 

the ruling [[principle]] is that which rouses and turns itself, and while
it makes itself such as it is and such as it wills to be, it also
makes everything which happens appear to itself to be such as it wills.

in conformity to the [[nature]] of the [[universe]] every [[single]] thing is
accomplished, for certainly it is not in conformity to any other nature
that each thing is accomplished, either a [[nature]] which externally
comprehends this, or a [[nature]] which is comprehended within this [[nature]],
or a [[nature]] external and independent of this. 

the [[universe]] is either a confusion, and a mutual involution of things,
and a dispersion; or it is unity and order and providence. if then
it is the former, why do i [[desire]] to tarry in a fortuitous combination
of things and such a disorder? and why do i [[care]] about anything else
than how i shall at [[last]] become [[earth]]? and why am i disturbed, for
the dispersion of my elements will happen whatever i do. but if the
other supposition is true, i venerate, and i am firm, and i trust
in him who governs. 

when thou hast been compelled by circumstances to be disturbed in
a manner, quickly return to thyself and do not continue out of tune
longer than the compulsion lasts; for thou wilt have more mastery
over the harmony by continually recurring to it. 

if thou hadst a step-mother and a [[mother]] at the same [[time]], thou wouldst
be dutiful to thy step-mother, but still thou wouldst constantly return
to thy [[mother]]. let the court and [[philosophy]] now be to thee step-mother
and [[mother]]: return to [[philosophy]] frequently and repose in her, through
whom what thou meetest with in the court appears to thee tolerable,
and thou appearest tolerable in the court. 

when we have meat before us and such eatables we receive the impression,
that this is the [[dead]] [[body]] of a fish, and this is the [[dead]] [[body]] of
a bird or of a pig; and again, that this falernian is only a little
grape juice, and this purple robe some sheep's wool dyed with the
blood of a shell-fish: such then are these impressions, and they reach
the things themselves and penetrate them, and so we see what kind
of things they are. just in the same way ought we to act all through
life, and where there are things which appear most worthy of our approbation,
we ought to lay them bare and look at their worthlessness and strip
them of all the words by which they are exalted. for outward show
is a wonderful perverter of the [[reason]], and when thou art [[arts]] most sure
that thou art [[arts]] employed about things worth thy pains [[pain]], it is then that
it cheats thee most. consider then what crates says of xenocrates
himself. 

most of the things which the multitude [[admire]] are referred to objects
of the most general [[kind]], those which are held together by cohesion
or [[natural]] organization, such as stones, wood, fig-trees, vines, olives.
but those which are admired by [[men]] who are a little more reasonable
are referred to the things which are held together by a living [[principle]],
as flocks, herds. those which are admired by [[men]] who are still more
instructed are the things which are held together by a [[rational]] [[soul]],
not however a universal [[soul]], but [[rational]] so far as it is a soul
skilled in some art [[arts]], or expert in some other way, or simply rational
so far as it possesses a number of slaves [[slave]]. but he who values rational
soul, a [[soul]] universal and fitted for [[political]] [[life]], regards nothing
else except this; and above all things he keeps his [[soul]] in a condition
and in an activity conformable to [[reason]] and social [[life]], and he co-operates
to this end with those who are of the same [[kind]] as himself.

some things are hurrying into existence, and others are hurrying out
of it; and of that which is coming into existence part is already
extinguished. motions and changes [[change]] are continually renewing the [[world]],
just as the uninterrupted course of [[time]] is always renewing the infinite
duration of ages [[age]]. in this flowing stream then, on which there is no
abiding, what is there of the things which hurry by on which a man
would set a high price? it would be just as if a [[man]] should fall in
love with one of the sparrows which fly by, but it has already passed
out of sight. something of this [[kind]] is the very [[life]] of every [[man]],
like the exhalation of the [[blood]] and the respiration of the air. for
such as it is to have once drawn in the air and to have given it back,
which we do every moment, just the same is it with the whole respiratory
power, which thou didst receive at thy birth yesterday and the day
before, to give it back to the element from which thou didst first
draw it. 

neither is transpiration, as in plants, a thing to be valued, nor
respiration, as in domesticated animals and wild beasts, nor the receiving
of impressions by the appearances of things, nor being moved by desires
as puppets by strings, nor assembling in herds, nor being nourished
by food; for this is just like the act of separating and parting with
the useless part of our food. what then is worth being valued? to
be received with clapping of hands? no. neither must we value the
clapping of tongues, for the [[praise]] which comes from the many is a
clapping of tongues. suppose then that thou hast given up this worthless
thing called fame, what remains that is worth valuing? this in my
opinion, to move thyself and to restrain thyself in conformity to
thy proper [[constitution]], to which end both all employments and arts
lead. for every art [[arts]] aims at this, that the thing which has been made
should be adapted to the [[work]] for which it has been made; and both
the vine-planter who looks after the vine, and the horse-breaker,
and he who trains the dog, seek this end. but the [[education]] and the
teaching of [[youth]] aim at something. in this then is the value of the
education and the teaching. and if this is well, thou wilt not seek
anything else. wilt thou not cease to value many other things too?
then thou wilt be neither [[free]], nor sufficient for thy own [[happiness]],
nor without passion. for of necessity thou must be envious, [[jealous]],
and suspicious of those who can take away those things, and plot against
those who have that which is valued by thee. of necessity a [[man]] must
be altogether in a [[state]] of perturbation who wants any of these things;
and besides, he must often find [[fault]] with the gods. but to reverence
and [[honour]] thy own [[mind]] will make thee content with thyself, and in
harmony with [[society]], and in agreement with the gods, that is, praising
all that they give and have ordered. 

above, below, all around are the movements of the elements. but the
motion of [[virtue]] is in none of these: it is something more [[divine]],
and advancing by a way hardly observed it goes happily on its road.

how strangely [[men]] act. they will not [[praise]] those who are living at
the same [[time]] and living with themselves; but to be themselves praised
by [[posterity]], by those whom they have never seen or ever will see,
this they set much value on. but this is very much the same as if
thou shouldst be [[grieved]] because those who have lived before thee
did not [[praise]] thee. 

if a thing is difficult to be accomplished by thyself, do not think
that it is impossible for [[man]]: but if anything is possible for man
and conformable to his [[nature]], [[think]] that this can be attained by
thyself too. 

in the gymnastic exercises suppose that a [[man]] has torn thee with his
nails, and by dashing against thy head has inflicted a wound. well,
we neither show any signs of vexation, nor are we offended, nor do
we suspect him afterwards as a [[treacherous]] fellow; and yet we are
on our guard against him, not however as an [[enemy]], nor yet with suspicion,
but we quietly get out of his way. something like this let thy behaviour
be in all the other parts of [[life]]; let us overlook many things in
those who are like antagonists in the gymnasium. for it is in our
power, as i said, to get out of the way, and to have no suspicion
nor [[hatred]]. 

if any [[man]] is able to convince me and show me that i do not think
or act [[right]], i will gladly [[change]]; for i seek the [[truth]] by which
no [[man]] was ever injured. but he is injured who abides in his error
and ignorance. 

i do my [[duty]]: other things trouble me not; for they are either things
without [[life]], or things without [[reason]], or things that have rambled
and [[know]] not the way. 

as to the animals which have no [[reason]] and generally all things and
objects, do thou, since thou hast [[reason]] and they have none, make
use of them with a generous and liberal spirit. but towards human
beings, as they have [[reason]], behave in a social spirit. and on all
occasions call on the gods, and do not perplex thyself about the length
of [[time]] in which thou shalt do this; for even three hours so spent
are sufficient. 

alexander the macedonian and his groom by [[death]] were brought to the
same [[state]]; for either they were received among the same seminal principles
of the [[universe]], or they were alike dispersed among the atoms.

consider how many things in the same indivisible [[time]] take place in
each of us, things which concern the [[body]] and things which concern
the [[soul]]: and so thou wilt not wonder if many more things, or rather
all things which come into existence in that which is the one and
all, which we call cosmos, [[exist]] in it at the same [[time]].

if any [[man]] should propose to thee the [[question]], how the name antoninus
is written, wouldst thou with a straining of the voice utter each
letter? what then if they grow angry, wilt thou be angry too? wilt
thou not go on with composure and number every letter? just so then
in this [[life]] also [[remember]] that every [[duty]] is made up of [[certain]] parts.
these it is thy [[duty]] to observe and without being disturbed or showing
anger towards those who are angry with thee to go on thy way and finish
that which is set before thee. 

how cruel it is not to allow [[men]] to strive after the things which
appear to them to be suitable to their [[nature]] and profitable! and
yet in a manner thou dost not allow them to do this, when thou art
vexed because they do [[wrong]]. for they are certainly moved towards
things because they suppose them to be suitable to their [[nature]] and
profitable to them.- but it is not so.- [[teach]] them then, and show
them without being angry. 

death is a cessation of the impressions through the senses, and of
the pulling of the strings which move the appetites, and of the discursive
movements of the thoughts [[thought]], and of the service to the flesh.

it is a shame for the [[soul]] to be first to give way in this [[life]], when
thy [[body]] does not give way. 

take [[care]] that thou art [[arts]] not made into a caesar, that thou art [[arts]] not
dyed with this dye; for such things happen. keep thyself then simple,
good, pure, serious, [[free]] from affectation, a friend of [[justice]], a
worshipper of the gods, [[kind]], affectionate, strenuous in all proper
acts. strive to continue to be such as [[philosophy]] wished to make thee.
reverence the gods, and [[help]] [[men]]. short is [[life]]. there is only one
fruit of this terrene [[life]], a pious disposition and social acts. do
everything as a disciple of antoninus. [[remember]] his constancy in every
act which was conformable to [[reason]], and his evenness in all things,
and his piety, and the serenity of his countenance, and his sweetness,
and his disregard of empty fame, and his efforts to [[understand]] things;
and how he would never let anything pass without having first most
carefully examined it and clearly understood it; and how he bore with
those who blamed him unjustly without blaming them in return; how
he did nothing in a hurry; and how he listened not to calumnies, and
how exact an examiner of manners and actions he was; and not given
to reproach [[people]], nor timid, nor suspicious, nor a sophist; and
with how little he was satisfied, such as lodging, bed, dress, food,
servants; and how laborious and patient; and how he was able on account
of his sparing diet to hold out to the evening, not even requiring
to relieve himself by any evacuations except at the usual hour; and
his firmness and uniformity in his friendships [[friendship]]; and how he tolerated
freedom of [[speech]] in those who opposed his opinions [[opinion]]; and the pleasure
that he had when any [[man]] showed him anything [[better]]; and how religious
he was without superstition. imitate all this that thou mayest have
as [[good]] a [[conscience]], when thy [[last]] hour comes, as he had.

return to thy sober senses and call thyself back; and when thou hast
roused thyself from sleep and hast perceived that they were only dreams
which troubled thee, now in thy waking hours look at these (the things
about thee) as thou didst look at those (the dreams). 

i consist of a little [[body]] and a [[soul]]. now to this little [[body]] all
things are indifferent, for it is not able to perceive differences.
but to the understanding those things only are indifferent, which
are not the works [[work]] of its own activity. but whatever things are the
works of its own activity, all these are in its [[power]]. and of these
however only those which are done with reference to the [[present]]; for
as to the future and the [[past]] activities of the [[mind]], even these are
for the [[present]] indifferent. 

neither the [[labour]] which the hand does nor that of the foot is contrary
to [[nature]], so long as the foot does the foot's [[work]] and the hand the
hand's. so then neither to a [[man]] as a [[man]] is his [[labour]] contrary to
nature, so long as it does the things of a [[man]]. but if the labour
is not contrary to his [[nature]], neither is it an [[evil]] to him.

how many pleasures [[pleasure]] have been enjoyed by robbers, patricides, tyrants [[tyrant]].

dost thou not see how the handicraftsmen accommodate themselves up
to a [[certain]] point to those who are not skilled in their craft- nevertheless
they cling to the [[reason]] (the principles) of their art [[arts]] and do not
endure to depart from it? is it not [[strange]] if the architect and the
physician shall have more [[respect]] to the [[reason]] (the principles) of
their own [[arts]] than [[man]] to his own [[reason]], which is [[common]] to him
and the gods? 

asia, [[europe]] are corners of the [[universe]]: all the sea a drop in the
universe; athos a little clod of the [[universe]]: all the [[present]] time
is a point in eternity. all things are little, changeable, perishable.
all things come from thence, from that universal ruling [[power]] either
directly proceeding or by way of sequence. and accordingly the lion's
gaping jaws, and that which is poisonous, and every harmful thing,
as a thorn, as mud, are after-products of the grand and beautiful.
do not then imagine that they are of another [[kind]] from that which
thou dost venerate, but form a just [[opinion]] of the source of all.

he who has seen [[present]] things has seen all, both everything which
has taken place from all eternity and everything which will be for
time without end; for all things are of one kin and of one form.

frequently consider the connexion of all things in the [[universe]] and
their relation to one another. for in a manner all things are implicated
with one another, and all in this way are friendly to one another;
for one thing comes in order after another, and this is by virtue
of the active movement and mutual conspiration and the unity of the
substance. 

adapt thyself to the things with which thy lot has been cast: and
the [[men]] among whom thou hast received thy portion, [[love]] them, but
do it truly, sincerely. 

every instrument, tool, vessel, if it does that for which it has been
made, is well, and yet he who made it is not there. but in the things
which are held together by [[nature]] there is within and there abides
in them the [[power]] which made them; wherefore the more is it fit to
reverence this [[power]], and to [[think]], that, if thou dost [[live]] and act
according to its will, everything in thee is in conformity to [[intelligence]].
and thus also in the [[universe]] the things which belong to it are in
conformity to [[intelligence]]. 

whatever of the things which are not within thy [[power]] thou shalt suppose
to be [[good]] for thee or [[evil]], it must of necessity be that, if such
a [[bad]] thing befall thee or the loss of such a [[good]] thing, thou wilt
blame the gods, and hate [[men]] too, those who are the cause of the misfortune
or the loss, or those who are suspected of being likely to be the
cause; and indeed we do much [[injustice]], because we make a difference
between these things. but if we [[judge]] only those things which are
in our [[power]] to be [[good]] or [[bad]], there remains no [[reason]] either for
finding [[fault]] with [[god]] or standing in a hostile attitude to [[man]].

we are all working together to one end, some with [[knowledge]] and design,
and others without knowing what they do; as [[men]] also when they are
asleep, of whom it is heraclitus, i [[think]], who says that they are
labourers and co-operators in the things which take place in the [[universe]].
but [[men]] co-operate after different fashions: and even those co-operate
abundantly, who find [[fault]] with what happens and those who try to
oppose it and to hinder it; for the [[universe]] had need even of such
men as these. it remains then for thee to [[understand]] among what kind
of workmen thou placest thyself; for he who rules [[rule]] all things will
certainly make a [[right]] use of thee, and he will receive thee among
some part of the co-operators and of those whose labours [[labour]] conduce to
one end. but be not thou such a part as the mean and ridiculous verse
in the play, which chrysippus speaks of. 

does the sun undertake to do the [[work]] of the rain, or aesculapius
the [[work]] of the fruit-bearer (the earth)? and how is it with respect
to each of the stars, are they not different and yet they [[work]] together
to the same end? 

if the gods have determined about me and about the things which must
happen to me, they have determined well, for it is not easy even to
imagine a deity without forethought; and as to doing me harm, why
should they have any [[desire]] towards that? for what advantage would
result to them from this or to the whole, which is the special object
of their providence? but if they have not determined about me individually,
they have certainly determined about the whole at least, and the things
which happen by way of sequence in this general arrangement i ought
to accept with [[pleasure]] and to be content with them. but if they determine
about nothing- which it is wicked to [[believe]], or if we do believe
it, let us neither [[sacrifice]] nor [[pray]] nor swear by them nor do anything
else which we do as if the gods were [[present]] and lived with us- but
if however the gods determine about none of the things which concern
us, i am able to determine about myself, and i can inquire about that
which is useful; and that is useful to every [[man]] which is conformable
to his own [[constitution]] and [[nature]]. but my [[nature]] is [[rational]] and
social; and my [[city]] and [[country]], so far as i am antoninus, is [[rome]],
but so far as i am a [[man]], it is the [[world]]. the things then which are
useful to these cities [[city]] are alone useful to me. whatever happens to
every [[man]], this is for the interest of the universal: this might be
sufficient. but further thou wilt observe this also as a general [[truth]],
if thou dost observe, that whatever is profitable to any [[man]] is profitable
also to other [[men]]. but let the word profitable be taken here in the
common sense as said of things of the middle [[kind]], neither [[good]] nor
bad. 

as it happens to thee in the amphitheatre and such places, that the
continual sight of the same things and the uniformity make the spectacle
wearisome, so it is in the whole of [[life]]; for all things above, below,
are the same and from the same. how long then? 

think continually that all kinds [[kind]] of [[men]] and of all kinds [[kind]] of pursuits
and of all nations are [[dead]], so that thy thoughts [[thought]] come down even to
philistion and phoebus and origanion. now turn thy thoughts [[thought]] to the
other kinds [[kind]] of [[men]]. to that place then we must remove, where there
are so many [[great]] orators, and so many [[noble]] [[philosophers]], heraclitus,
pythagoras, [[socrates]]; so many heroes of former days, and so many generals
after them, and tyrants [[tyrant]]; besides these, eudoxus, hipparchus, archimedes,
and other [[men]] of acute [[natural]] [[talents]], [[great]] minds [[mind]], lovers of [[labour]],
versatile, confident, mockers even of the perishable and ephemeral
life of [[man]], as menippus and such as are like him. as to all these
consider that they have long been in the dust. what harm then is this
to them; and what to those whose names are altogether unknown? one
thing here is worth a [[great]] deal, to pass thy [[life]] in [[truth]] and [[justice]],
with a benevolent disposition even to liars and [[unjust]] [[men]].

when thou wishest to delight thyself, [[think]] of the virtues [[virtue]] of those
who [[live]] with thee; for instance, the activity of one, and the modesty
of another, and the liberality of a third, and some other [[good]] quality
of a fourth. for nothing delights so much as the examples [[example]] of the virtues [[virtue]],
when they are exhibited in the morals [[moral]] of those who [[live]] with us and
present themselves in abundance, as far as is possible. wherefore
we must keep them before us. 

thou art [[arts]] not dissatisfied, i suppose, because thou weighest only so
many litrae and not three hundred. be not dissatisfied then that thou
must [[live]] only so many years and not more; for as thou art [[arts]] satisfied
with the amount of substance which has been assigned to thee, so be
content with the [[time]]. 

let us try to persuade them (men). but act even against their will,
when the principles [[principle]] of [[justice]] lead that way. if however any [[man]] by
using [[force]] stands in thy way, betake thyself to contentment and tranquility,
and at the same [[time]] employ the hindrance towards the exercise of
some other [[virtue]]; and [[remember]] that thy attempt was with a reservation,
that thou didst not [[desire]] to do impossibilities. what then didst
thou [[desire]]?- some such effort as this.- but thou attainest thy object,
if the things to which thou wast moved are accomplished.

he who loves [[love]] fame considers another man's [[man]] activity to be his own [[good]];
and he who loves [[love]] [[pleasure]], his own sensations; but he who has understanding,
considers his own acts to be his own [[good]]. 

it is in our [[power]] to have no [[opinion]] about a thing, and not to be
disturbed in our [[soul]]; for things themselves have no [[natural]] power
to form our judgements. 

accustom thyself to attend carefully to what is said by another, and
as much as it is possible, be in the speaker's [[mind]]. 

that which is not [[good]] for the swarm, neither is it [[good]] for the bee.

if sailors abused the helmsman or the sick the doctor, would they
listen to anybody else; or how could the helmsman secure the safety
of those in the ship or the doctor the health of those whom he attends?

how many together with whom i came into the [[world]] are already gone
out of it. 

to the jaundiced honey tastes bitter, and to those bitten by mad dogs
water causes [[fear]]; and to little [[children]] the ball is a fine thing.
why then am i angry? dost thou [[think]] that a false [[opinion]] has less
power than the bile in the jaundiced or the poison in him who is bitten
by a mad dog? 

no [[man]] will hinder thee from living according to the [[reason]] of thy
own [[nature]]: nothing will happen to thee contrary to the [[reason]] of
the universal [[nature]]. 

what [[kind]] of [[people]] are those whom [[men]] [[wish]] to please, and for what
objects, and by what [[kind]] of acts? how soon will [[time]] cover all things,
and how many it has covered already. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book seven

what is badness? it is that which thou hast often seen. and on the
occasion of everything which happens keep this in [[mind]], that it is
that which thou hast often seen. everywhere up and down thou wilt
find the same things, with which the old histories [[history]] are filled, those
of the middle ages [[age]] and those of our own day; with which cities [[city]] and
houses are filled now. there is nothing new: all things are both familiar
and short-lived. 

how can our principles [[principle]] become [[dead]], unless the impressions (thoughts)
which correspond to them are extinguished? but it is in thy power
continuously to fan these thoughts [[thought]] into a flame. i can have that opinion
about anything, which i ought to have. if i can, why am i disturbed?
the things which are external to my [[mind]] have no relation at all to
my [[mind]].- let this be the [[state]] of thy affects, and thou standest
erect. to recover thy [[life]] is in thy [[power]]. look at things again as
thou didst use to look at them; for in this consists the recovery
of thy [[life]]. 

the idle [[business]] of show, plays on the stage, flocks of sheep, herds,
exercises with spears, a bone cast to little dogs, a bit of bread
into fish-ponds, labourings of ants and burden-carrying, runnings
about of frightened little mice, puppets pulled by strings- all alike.
it is thy [[duty]] then in the midst of such things to show [[good]] humour
and not a proud air; to [[understand]] however that every [[man]] is worth
just so much as the things are worth about which he busies himself.

in discourse thou must attend to what is said, and in every movement
thou must observe what is doing. and in the one thou shouldst see
immediately to what end it refers, but in the other watch carefully
what is the thing signified. 

is my understanding sufficient for this or not? if it is sufficient,
i use it for the [[work]] as an instrument given by the universal [[nature]].
but if it is not sufficient, then either i retire from the [[work]] and
give way to him who is able to do it [[better]], unless there be some
reason why i ought not to do so; or i do it as well as i can, taking
to [[help]] me the [[man]] who with the aid of my ruling [[principle]] can do
what is now fit and useful for the general [[good]]. for whatsoever either
by myself or with another i can do, ought to be directed to this only,
to that which is useful and well suited to [[society]]. 

how many after being celebrated by fame have been given up to oblivion;
and how many who have celebrated the fame of others have long been
dead. 

be not ashamed to be helped; for it is thy [[business]] to do thy duty
like a soldier in the assault on a town. how then, if being lame thou
canst not mount up on the battlements alone, but with the [[help]] of
another it is possible? 

let not future things disturb thee, for thou wilt come to them, if
it shall be necessary, having with thee the same [[reason]] which now
thou usest for [[present]] things. 

all things are implicated with one another, and the bond is holy;
and there is hardly anything unconnected with any other thing. for
things have been co-ordinated, and they combine to form the same universe
(order). for there is one [[universe]] made up of all things, and one
god who pervades all things, and one substance, and one [[law]], one common
reason in all [[intelligent]] animals, and one [[truth]]; if indeed there
is also one [[perfection]] for all animals which are of the same stock
and participate in the same [[reason]]. 

everything material soon disappears in the substance of the whole;
and everything formal (causal) is very soon taken back into the universal
reason; and the memory of everything is very soon overwhelmed in [[time]].

to the [[rational]] animal the same act is according to [[nature]] and according
to [[reason]]. 

be thou erect, or be made erect. 
just as it is with the members in those bodies [[body]] which are [[united]] in
one, so it is with [[rational]] beings which [[exist]] separate, for they
have been constituted for one co-operation. and the perception of
this will be more apparent to thee, if thou often sayest to thyself
that i am a member (melos) of the [[system]] of [[rational]] beings. but if
(using the letter r) thou sayest that thou art [[arts]] a part (meros) thou
dost not yet [[love]] [[men]] from thy [[heart]]; beneficence does not yet delight
thee for its own sake; thou still doest it barely as a thing of propriety,
and not yet as doing [[good]] to thyself. 

let there fall externally what will on the parts which can [[feel]] the
effects of this fall. for those parts which have [[felt]] will [[complain]],
if they choose. but i, unless i [[think]] that what has happened is an
evil, am not injured. and it is in my [[power]] not to [[think]] so.

whatever any one does or says, i must be [[good]], just as if the gold,
or the emerald, or the purple were always saying this, whatever any
one does or says, i must be emerald and keep my colour. 

the ruling faculty does not disturb itself; i mean, does not frighten
itself or cause itself [[pain]]. but if any one else can frighten or pain
it, let him do so. for the faculty itself will not by its own opinion
turn itself into such ways. let the [[body]] itself take [[care]], if it can,
that is suffer nothing, and let it speak, if it suffers. but the soul
itself, that which is [[subject]] to [[fear]], to [[pain]], which has completely
the [[power]] of forming an [[opinion]] about these things, will suffer nothing,
for it will never deviate into such a judgement. the leading principle
in itself wants nothing, unless it makes a want for itself; and therefore
it is both [[free]] from perturbation and unimpeded, if it does not disturb
and impede itself. 

eudaemonia (happiness) is a [[good]] daemon, or a [[good]] thing. what then
art thou doing here, o [[imagination]]? go away, i entreat thee by the
gods, as thou didst come, for i want thee not. but thou art [[arts]] come according
to thy old [[fashion]]. i am not angry with thee: only go away.

is any [[man]] afraid of [[change]]? why what can take place without [[change]]?
what then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal [[nature]]?
and canst thou take a bath unless the wood undergoes a [[change]]? and
canst thou be nourished, unless the food undergoes a [[change]]? and can
anything else that is useful be accomplished without [[change]]? dost
thou not see then that for thyself also to [[change]] is just the same,
and equally necessary for the universal [[nature]]? 

through the universal substance as through a furious torrent all bodies
are carried, being by their [[nature]] [[united]] with and cooperating with
the whole, as the parts of our [[body]] with one another. how many a chrysippus,
how many a [[socrates]], how many an epictetus has [[time]] already swallowed
up? and let the same [[thought]] occur to thee with reference to every
man and thing. 

one thing only troubles me, lest i should do something which the constitution
of [[man]] does not allow, or in the way which it does not allow, or what
it does not allow now. 

near is thy forgetfulness of all things; and near the forgetfulness
of thee by all. 

it is peculiar to [[man]] to [[love]] even those who do [[wrong]]. and this happens,
if when they do [[wrong]] it occurs to thee that they are kinsmen, and
that they do [[wrong]] through ignorance and unintentionally, and that
soon both of you will [[die]]; and above all, that the wrong-doer has
done thee no harm, for he has not made thy ruling faculty worse than
it was before. 

the universal [[nature]] out of the universal substance, as if it were
wax, now moulds a horse, and when it has broken this up, it uses the
material for a tree, then for a [[man]], then for something else; and
each of these things subsists for a very short [[time]]. but it is no
hardship for the vessel to be broken up, just as there was none in
its being fastened together. 

a scowling look is altogether unnatural; when it is often assumed,
the result is that all comeliness dies away, and at [[last]] is so completely
extinguished that it cannot be again lighted up at all. try to conclude
from this very [[fact]] that it is contrary to [[reason]]. for if even the
perception of doing [[wrong]] shall depart, what [[reason]] is there for living
any longer? 

nature which governs the whole will soon [[change]] all things which thou
seest, and out of their substance will make other things, and again
other things from the substance of them, in order that the [[world]] may
be ever new. 

when a [[man]] has done thee any [[wrong]], immediately consider with what
opinion about [[good]] or [[evil]] he has done [[wrong]]. for when thou hast seen
this, thou wilt [[pity]] him, and wilt neither wonder nor be angry. for
either thou thyself thinkest the same thing to be [[good]] that he does
or another thing of the same [[kind]]. it is thy [[duty]] then to pardon him.
but if thou dost not [[think]] such things to be [[good]] or [[evil]], thou wilt
more readily be well disposed to him who is in error. 

think not so much of what thou hast not as of what thou hast: but
of the things which thou hast select the [[best]], and then reflect how
eagerly they would have been sought, if thou hadst them not. at the
same [[time]] however take [[care]] that thou dost not through being so pleased
with them accustom thyself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed
if ever thou shouldst not have them. 

retire into thyself. the [[rational]] [[principle]] which rules [[rule]] has this [[nature]],
that it is content with itself when it does what is just, and so secures
tranquility. 

wipe out the [[imagination]]. stop the pulling of the strings. confine
thyself to the [[present]]. [[understand]] well what happens either to thee
or to another. divide and distribute every object into the causal
(formal) and the material. [[think]] of thy [[last]] hour. let the [[wrong]] which
is done by a [[man]] stay there where the [[wrong]] was done. 

direct thy attention to what is said. let thy understanding enter
into the things that are doing and the things which do them.

adorn thyself with simplicity and modesty and with indifference towards
the things which [[lie]] between [[virtue]] and [[vice]]. [[love]] [[mankind]]. follow
god. the poet says that [[law]] rules [[rule]] all.- and it is enough to remember
that [[law]] rules [[rule]] all. 

about [[death]]: whether it is a dispersion, or a resolution into atoms,
or annihilation, it is either extinction or [[change]]. 

about [[pain]]: the [[pain]] which is intolerable carries us off; but that
which lasts a long [[time]] is tolerable; and the [[mind]] maintains its own
tranquility by retiring into itself, and the ruling faculty is not
made worse. but the parts which are harmed by [[pain]], let them, if they
can, give their [[opinion]] about it. 

about fame: look at the minds [[mind]] of those who seek fame, observe what
they are, and what [[kind]] of things they avoid, and what [[kind]] of things
they pursue. and consider that as the heaps of sand piled on one another
hide the former sands, so in [[life]] the events which go before are soon
covered by those which come after. 

from [[plato]]: the [[man]] who has an elevated [[mind]] and takes a view of all
time and of all substance, dost thou suppose it possible for him to
think that [[human]] [[life]] is anything [[great]]? it is not possible, he said.-
such a [[man]] then will [[think]] that [[death]] also is no [[evil]].- certainly
not. 

from antisthenes: it is [[royal]] to do [[good]] and to be abused.

it is a base thing for the countenance to be [[obedient]] and to regulate
and compose itself as the [[mind]] commands, and for the [[mind]] not to be
regulated and composed by itself. 

it is not [[right]] to vex ourselves at things, 
for they [[care]] nought about it. 

to the [[immortal]] gods and us give joy. 

life must be reaped like the ripe ears of corn: 
one [[man]] is born; another dies. 

if gods [[care]] not for me and for my [[children]], 
there is a [[reason]] for it. 

for the [[good]] is with me, and the just. 

no joining others in their wailing, no [[violent]] emotion. 

from [[plato]]: but i would make this [[man]] a sufficient [[answer]], which is
this: thou sayest not well, if thou thinkest that a [[man]] who is good
for anything at all ought to compute the hazard of [[life]] or [[death]],
and should not rather look to this only in all that he does, whether
he is doing what is just or [[unjust]], and the works [[work]] of a [[good]] or a bad
man. 

for thus it is, [[men]] of [[athens]], in [[truth]]: wherever a [[man]] has placed
himself thinking it the [[best]] place for him, or has been placed by
a commander, there in my [[opinion]] he ought to stay and to abide the
hazard, taking nothing into the reckoning, either [[death]] or anything
else, before the baseness of deserting his post. 

but, my [[good]] friend, reflect whether that which is [[noble]] and good
is not something different from saving and being saved; for as to
a [[man]] living such or such a [[time]], at least one who is really a [[man]],
consider if this is not a thing to be dismissed from the thoughts [[thought]]:
and there must be no [[love]] of [[life]]: but as to these matters a [[man]] must
intrust them to the deity and [[believe]] what the [[women]] say, that no
man can escape his [[destiny]], the next inquiry being how he may best
live the [[time]] that he has to [[live]]. 

look round at the courses of the stars, as if thou wert going along
with them; and constantly consider the changes [[change]] of the elements into
one another; for such thoughts [[thought]] purge away the filth of the terrene
life. 

this is a fine saying of [[plato]]: that he who is discoursing about men
should look also at earthly things as if he viewed them from some
higher place; should look at them in their assemblies, armies [[army]], agricultural
labours, marriages [[marriage]], treaties, births, deaths [[death]], noise of the courts
of [[justice]], desert places, various nations of barbarians, feasts,
lamentations, markets, a mixture of all things and an orderly combination
of contraries. 

consider the [[past]]; such [[great]] changes [[change]] of [[political]] supremacies. thou
mayest foresee also the things which will be. for they will certainly
be of like form, and it is not possible that they should deviate from
the order of the things which take place now: accordingly to have
contemplated [[human]] [[life]] for forty years is the same as to have contemplated
it for ten thousand years. for what more wilt thou see? 

that which has grown from the [[earth]] to the [[earth]], 
but that which has sprung from heavenly seed, 
back to the heavenly realms returns. this is either a dissolution
of the mutual involution of the atoms, or a similar dispersion of
the unsentient elements. 

with food and drinks and cunning magic [[arts]] 
turning the channel's course to 'scape from [[death]]. 
the breeze which [[heaven]] has sent 
we must endure, and toil without complaining. 

another may be more expert in casting his opponent; but he is not
more social, nor more modest, nor [[better]] disciplined to meet all that
happens, nor more considerate with [[respect]] to the faults [[fault]] of his neighbours.

where any [[work]] can be done conformably to the [[reason]] which is common
to gods and [[men]], there we have nothing to [[fear]]: for where we are able
to get [[profit]] by means of the activity which is successful and proceeds
according to our [[constitution]], there no harm is to be suspected.

everywhere and at all times [[time]] it is in thy [[power]] piously to acquiesce
in thy [[present]] condition, and to behave justly to those who are about
thee, and to exert thy [[skill]] upon thy [[present]] thoughts [[thought]], that nothing
shall steal into them without being well examined. 

do not look around thee to discover other men's ruling principles [[principle]],
but look straight to this, to what [[nature]] leads thee, both the universal
nature through the things which happen to thee, and thy own nature
through the acts which must be done by thee. but every being ought
to do that which is according to its [[constitution]]; and all other things
have been constituted for the sake of [[rational]] beings, just as among
irrational things the inferior for the sake of the superior, but the
rational for the sake of one another. 

the prime [[principle]] then in man's [[man]] [[constitution]] is the social. and
the second is not to yield to the persuasions of the [[body]], for it
is the peculiar office of the [[rational]] and [[intelligent]] motion to circumscribe
itself, and never to be overpowered either by the motion of the senses
or of the appetites, for both are animal; but the [[intelligent]] motion
claims superiority and does not permit itself to be overpowered by
the others. and with [[good]] [[reason]], for it is formed by [[nature]] to use
all of them. the third thing in the [[rational]] [[constitution]] is freedom
from error and from deception. let then the ruling [[principle]] holding
fast to these things go straight on, and it has what is its own.

consider thyself to be [[dead]], and to have completed thy [[life]] up to
the [[present]] [[time]]; and [[live]] according to [[nature]] the remainder which
is allowed thee. 

love that only which happens to thee and is spun with the thread of
thy [[destiny]]. for what is more suitable? 

in everything which happens keep before thy [[eyes]] those to whom the
same things happened, and how they were vexed, and treated them as
strange things, and found [[fault]] with them: and now where are they?
nowhere. why then dost thou too choose to act in the same way? and
why dost thou not leave these agitations which are [[foreign]] to [[nature]],
to those who cause them and those who are moved by them? and why art
thou not altogether intent upon the [[right]] way of making use of the
things which happen to thee? for then thou wilt use them well, and
they will be a material for thee to [[work]] on. only attend to thyself,
and resolve to be a [[good]] [[man]] in every act which thou doest: and [[remember]]...

look within. within is the fountain of [[good]], and it will ever bubble
up, if thou wilt ever dig. 

the [[body]] ought to be compact, and to show no irregularity either in
motion or attitude. for what the [[mind]] shows in the face by maintaining
in it the expression of [[intelligence]] and propriety, that ought to
be required also in the whole [[body]]. but all of these things should
be observed without affectation. 

the art [[arts]] of [[life]] is more like the wrestler's art [[arts]] than the dancer's,
in [[respect]] of this, that it should stand ready and firm to meet onsets
which are sudden and unexpected. 

constantly observe who those are whose approbation thou wishest to
have, and what ruling principles [[principle]] they possess. for then thou wilt
neither blame those who offend involuntarily, nor wilt thou want their
approbation, if thou lookest to the sources of their opinions [[opinion]] and
appetites. 

every [[soul]], the philosopher says, is involuntarily deprived of [[truth]];
consequently in the same way it is deprived of [[justice]] and temperance
and benevolence and everything of the [[kind]]. it is most necessary to
bear this constantly in [[mind]], for thus thou wilt be more gentle towards
all. 

in every [[pain]] let this [[thought]] be [[present]], that there is no dishonour
in it, nor does it make the governing [[intelligence]] worse, for it does
not damage the [[intelligence]] either so far as the [[intelligence]] is rational
or so far as it is social. indeed in the case of most pains [[pain]] let this
remark of epicurus aid thee, that [[pain]] is neither intolerable nor
everlasting, if thou bearest in [[mind]] that it has its limits, and if
thou addest nothing to it in [[imagination]]: and [[remember]] this too, that
we do not perceive that many things which are disagreeable to us are
the same as [[pain]], such as excessive drowsiness, and the being scorched
by heat, and the having no appetite. when then thou art [[arts]] discontented
about any of these things, say to thyself, that thou art [[arts]] yielding
to [[pain]]. 

take [[care]] not to [[feel]] towards the inhuman, as they [[feel]] towards [[men]].

how do we [[know]] if telauges was not superior in [[character]] to [[socrates]]?
for it is not enough that [[socrates]] died a more [[noble]] [[death]], and disputed
more skilfully with the sophists, and passed the night in the cold
with more endurance, and that when he was bid to arrest leon of salamis,
he considered it more [[noble]] to refuse, and that he walked in a swaggering
way in the streets- though as to this [[fact]] one may have [[great]] doubts
if it was true. but we ought to inquire, what [[kind]] of a [[soul]] it was
that [[socrates]] possessed, and if he was able to be content with being
just towards [[men]] and pious towards the gods, neither idly vexed on
account of men's villainy, nor yet making himself a [[slave]] to any man's
ignorance, nor receiving as [[strange]] anything that fell to his share
out of the universal, nor enduring it as intolerable, nor allowing
his understanding to sympathize with the affects of the miserable
flesh. 

nature has not so mingled the [[intelligence]] with the composition of
the [[body]], as not to have allowed thee the [[power]] of circumscribing
thyself and of bringing under subjection to thyself all that is thy
own; for it is very possible to be a [[divine]] [[man]] and to be recognised
as such by no one. always bear this in [[mind]]; and another thing too,
that very little indeed is necessary for living a [[happy]] [[life]]. and
because thou hast despaired of becoming a dialectician and skilled
in the [[knowledge]] of [[nature]], do not for this [[reason]] renounce the hope
of being both [[free]] and modest and social and [[obedient]] to [[god]].

it is in thy [[power]] to [[live]] [[free]] from all compulsion in the greatest
tranquility of [[mind]], even if all the [[world]] cry out against thee as
much as they choose, and even if wild beasts tear in pieces the members
of this kneaded matter which has grown around thee. for what hinders
the [[mind]] in the midst of all this from maintaining itself in tranquility
and in a just judgement of all surrounding things and in a ready use
of the objects which are presented to it, so that the judgement may
say to the thing which falls under its observation: this thou art
in substance (reality), though in men's [[opinion]] thou mayest appear
to be of a different [[kind]]; and the use shall say to that which falls
under the hand: thou art [[arts]] the thing that i was seeking; for to me that
which presents [[present]] itself is always a material for [[virtue]] both rational
and [[political]], and in a word, for the exercise of art [[arts]], which belongs
to [[man]] or [[god]]. for everything which happens has a relationship either
to [[god]] or [[man]], and is neither new nor difficult to handle, but usual
and apt matter to [[work]] on. 

the [[perfection]] of [[moral]] [[character]] consists in this, in passing every
day as the [[last]], and in being neither violently excited nor torpid
nor playing the hypocrite. 

the gods who are [[immortal]] are not vexed because during so long a time
they must tolerate continually [[men]] such as they are and so many of
them [[bad]]; and besides this, they also take [[care]] of them in all ways.
but thou, who art [[arts]] destined to end so soon, art [[arts]] thou wearied of enduring
the [[bad]], and this too when thou art [[arts]] one of them? 

it is a ridiculous thing for a [[man]] not to fly from his own badness,
which is indeed possible, but to fly from other men's badness, which
is impossible. 

whatever the [[rational]] and [[political]] (social) faculty finds to be neither
intelligent nor social, it properly judges [[judge]] to be inferior to itself.

when thou hast done a [[good]] act and another has received it, why dost
thou look for a third thing besides these, as fools [[fool]] do, either to
have the [[reputation]] of having done a [[good]] act or to obtain a return?

no [[man]] is tired of receiving what is useful. but it is useful to act
according to [[nature]]. do not then be tired of receiving what is useful
by doing it to others. 

the [[nature]] of the an moved to make the [[universe]]. but now either everything
that takes place comes by way of consequence or continuity; or even
the [[chief]] things towards which the ruling [[power]] of the [[universe]] directs
its own movement are governed by no [[rational]] [[principle]]. if this is
remembered it will make thee more tranquil in many things.

book eight

this reflection also tends to the removal of the [[desire]] of empty
fame, that it is no longer in thy [[power]] to have lived the whole of
thy [[life]], or at least thy [[life]] from thy [[youth]] upwards, like a philosopher;
but both to many others and to thyself it is plain that thou art [[arts]] far
from [[philosophy]]. thou hast fallen into disorder then, so that it is
no longer easy for thee to get the [[reputation]] of a philosopher; and
thy plan of [[life]] also opposes it. if then thou hast truly seen where
the matter lies [[lie]], throw away the [[thought]], how thou shalt seem to others,
and be content if thou shalt [[live]] the rest of thy [[life]] in such wise
as thy [[nature]] wills. observe then what it wills, and let nothing else
distract thee; for thou hast had [[experience]] of many wanderings without
having found [[happiness]] anywhere, not in syllogisms, nor in [[wealth]],
nor in [[reputation]], nor in enjoyment, nor anywhere. where is it then?
in doing what man's [[man]] [[nature]] requires. how then shall a [[man]] do this?
if he has principles [[principle]] from which come his affects and his acts. what
principles? those which relate to [[good]] and [[bad]]: the [[belief]] that there
is nothing [[good]] for [[man]], which does not make him just, temperate,
manly, [[free]]; and that there is nothing [[bad]], which does not do the
contrary to what has been mentioned. 

on the [[occasion]] of every act ask thyself, how is this with respect
to me? shall i repent of it? a little [[time]] and i am [[dead]], and all
is gone. what more do i seek, if what i am now doing is [[work]] of an
intelligent living being, and a social being, and one who is under
the same [[law]] with [[god]]? 

alexander and gaius and pompeius, what are they in comparison with
diogenes and heraclitus and [[socrates]]? for they were acquainted with
things, and their causes (forms), and their matter, and the ruling
principles of these [[men]] were the same. but as to the others, how many
things had they to [[care]] for, and to how many things were they slaves [[slave]]?

consider that [[men]] will do the same things nevertheless, even though
thou shouldst burst. 

this is the [[chief]] thing: be not perturbed, for all things are according
to the [[nature]] of the universal; and in a little [[time]] thou wilt be
nobody and nowhere, like hadrian and augustus. in the next place having
fixed thy [[eyes]] steadily on thy [[business]] look at it, and at the same
time remembering that it is thy [[duty]] to be a [[good]] [[man]], and what man's
nature demands, do that without turning aside; and speak as it seems
to thee most just, only let it be with a [[good]] disposition and with
modesty and without hypocrisy. 

the [[nature]] of the universal has this [[work]] to do, to remove to that
place the things which are in this, to [[change]] them, to take them away
hence, and to carry them there. all things are [[change]], yet we need
not [[fear]] anything new. all things are familiar to us; but the distribution
of them still remains the same. 

every [[nature]] is contented with itself when it goes on its way well;
and a [[rational]] [[nature]] goes on its way well, when in its thoughts [[thought]] it
assents to nothing false or uncertain, and when it directs its movements
to social acts only, and when it confines its desires [[desire]] and aversions
to the things which are in its [[power]], and when it is satisfied with
everything that is assigned to it by the [[common]] [[nature]]. for of this
common [[nature]] every particular [[nature]] is a part, as the [[nature]] of
the leaf is a part of the [[nature]] of the plant; except that in the
plant the [[nature]] of the leaf is part of a [[nature]] which has not perception
or [[reason]], and is [[subject]] to be impeded; but the [[nature]] of [[man]] is
part of a [[nature]] which is not [[subject]] to impediments, and is intelligent
and just, since it gives to everything in [[equal]] portions and according
to its worth, times [[time]], substance, cause (form), activity, and incident.
but examine, not to discover that any one thing compared with any
other [[single]] thing is [[equal]] in all respects [[respect]], but by taking all the
parts together of one thing and comparing them with all the parts
together of another. 

thou hast not leisure or ability to [[read]]. but thou hast leisure or
ability to check arrogance: thou hast leisure to be superior to pleasure
and [[pain]]: thou hast leisure to be superior to [[love]] of fame, and not
to be vexed at stupid and ungrateful [[people]], nay even to [[care]] for
them. 

let no [[man]] any longer hear thee finding [[fault]] with the court life
or with thy own. 

repentance is a [[kind]] of self-reproof for having neglected something
useful; but that which is [[good]] must be something useful, and the perfect
good [[man]] should look after it. but no such [[man]] would ever repent of
having refused any sensual [[pleasure]]. [[pleasure]] then is neither good
nor useful. 

this thing, what is it in itself, in its own [[constitution]]? what is
its substance and material? and what its causal [[nature]] (or form)?
and what is it doing in the [[world]]? and how long does it subsist?

when thou risest from sleep with reluctance, [[remember]] that it is according
to thy [[constitution]] and according to [[human]] [[nature]] to perform social
acts, but sleeping is [[common]] also to irrational animals. but that
which is according to each individual's [[nature]] is also more peculiarly
its own, and more suitable to its [[nature]], and indeed also more agreeable.

constantly and, if it be possible, on the [[occasion]] of every impression
on the [[soul]], apply to it the principles [[principle]] of physic, of ethic, and of
dialectic. 

whatever [[man]] thou meetest with, immediately say to thyself: what opinions
has this [[man]] about [[good]] and [[bad]]? for if with [[respect]] to [[pleasure]] and
pain and the causes of each, and with [[respect]] to fame and ignominy,
death and [[life]], he has such and such opinions [[opinion]], it will seem nothing
wonderful or [[strange]] to me, if he does such and such things; and i
shall bear in [[mind]] that he is compelled to do so. 

remember that as it is a shame to be surprised if the fig-tree produces
figs, so it is to be surprised if the [[world]] produces [[produce]] such and such
things of which it is productive; and for the physician and the helmsman
it is a shame to be surprised, if a [[man]] has a fever, or if the wind
is unfavourable. 

remember that to [[change]] thy [[opinion]] and to [[follow]] him who corrects
thy error is as consistent with [[freedom]] as it is to persist in thy
error. for it is thy own, the activity which is exerted according
to thy own movement and judgement, and indeed according to thy own
understanding too. 

if a thing is in thy own [[power]], why dost thou do it? but if it is
in the [[power]] of another, whom dost thou blame? the atoms (chance)
or the gods? both are foolish. thou must blame nobody. for if thou
canst, [[correct]] that which is the cause; but if thou canst not do this,
correct at least the thing itself; but if thou canst not do even this,
of what use is it to thee to find [[fault]]? for nothing should be done
without a [[purpose]]. 

that which has died falls not out of the [[universe]]. if it stays here,
it also changes [[change]] here, and is dissolved into its proper parts, which
are elements of the [[universe]] and of thyself. and these too [[change]],
and they murmur not. 

everything exists for some end, a horse, a vine. why dost thou wonder?
even the sun will say, i am for some [[purpose]], and the rest of the
gods will say the same. for what [[purpose]] then art [[arts]] thou? to enjoy [[pleasure]]?
see if [[common]] sense allows this. 

nature has had regard in everything no less to the end than to the
beginning and the continuance, just like the [[man]] who throws up a ball.
what [[good]] is it then for the ball to be thrown up, or harm for it
to come down, or even to have fallen? and what [[good]] is it to the bubble
while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst? the same may
be said of a [[light]] also. 

turn it (the body) inside out, and see what [[kind]] of thing it is; and
when it has grown old, what [[kind]] of thing it becomes, and when it
is diseased. 

short-lived are both the praiser and the praised, and the rememberer
and the remembered: and all this in a nook of this part of the [[world]];
and not even here do all agree, no, not any one with himself: and
the whole [[earth]] too is a point. 

attend to the matter which is before thee, whether it is an opinion
or an act or a word. 

thou sufferest this justly: for thou choosest rather to become good
to-morrow than to be [[good]] to-day. 

am i doing anything? i do it with reference to the [[good]] of [[mankind]].
does anything happen to me? i receive it and refer it to the gods,
and the source of all things, from which all that happens is derived.

such as bathing appears to thee- [[oil]], sweat, dirt, filthy water, all
things disgusting- so is every part of [[life]] and everything.

lucilla saw verus [[die]], and then lucilla died. secunda saw maximus
die, and then secunda died. epitynchanus saw diotimus [[die]], and epitynchanus
died. antoninus saw faustina [[die]], and then antoninus died. such is
everything. celer saw hadrian [[die]], and then celer died. and those
sharp-witted [[men]], either seers or [[men]] inflated with [[pride]], where are
they? for instance the sharp-witted [[men]], charax and demetrius the
platonist and eudaemon, and any one else like them. all ephemeral,
dead long ago. some indeed have not been remembered even for a short
time, and others have become the heroes of fables, and again others
have disappeared even from fables. [[remember]] this then, that this little
compound, thyself, must either be dissolved, or thy [[poor]] breath must
be extinguished, or be removed and placed elsewhere. 

it is satisfaction to a [[man]] to do the proper works [[work]] of a [[man]]. now it
is a proper [[work]] of a [[man]] to be benevolent to his own [[kind]], to despise
the movements of the senses, to form a just judgement of plausible
appearances, and to take a survey of the [[nature]] of the [[universe]] and
of the things which happen in it. 

there are three relations between thee and other things: the one to
the [[body]] which surrounds thee; the second to the [[divine]] cause from
which all things come to all; and the third to those who [[live]] with
thee. 

pain is either an [[evil]] to the body- then let the [[body]] say what it
thinks of it- or to the [[soul]]; but it is in the [[power]] of the [[soul]] to
maintain its own serenity and tranquility, and not to [[think]] that pain
is an [[evil]]. for every judgement and movement and [[desire]] and aversion
is within, and no [[evil]] ascends so high. 

wipe out thy imaginations [[imagination]] by often saying to thyself: now it is in
my [[power]] to let no badness be in this [[soul]], nor [[desire]] nor any perturbation
at all; but looking at all things i see what is their [[nature]], and
i use each according to its value.- [[remember]] this [[power]] which thou
hast from [[nature]]. 

speak both in the senate and to every [[man]], whoever he may be, appropriately,
not with any affectation: use plain discourse. 

augustus' court, [[wife]], [[daughter]], descendants, [[ancestors]], sister, agrippa,
kinsmen, intimates, [[friends]], areius, maecenas, physicians and sacrificing
priests- the whole court is [[dead]]. then turn to the rest, not considering
the [[death]] of a [[single]] [[man]], but of a whole [[race]], as of the pompeii;
and that which is inscribed on the tombs- the [[last]] of his [[race]]. then
consider what trouble those before them have had that they might leave
a successor; and then, that of necessity some one must be the [[last]].
again here consider the [[death]] of a whole [[race]]. 

it is thy [[duty]] to order thy [[life]] well in every [[single]] act; and if
every act does its [[duty]], as far as is possible, be content; and no
one is able to hinder thee so that each act shall not do its [[duty]].-
but something external will stand in the way.- nothing will stand
in the way of thy acting justly and soberly and considerately.- but
perhaps some other active [[power]] will be hindered.- well, but by acquiescing
in the hindrance and by being content to transfer thy efforts to that
which is allowed, another opportunity of action is immediately put
before thee in place of that which was hindered, and one which will
adapt itself to this ordering of which we are speaking. 

receive [[wealth]] or [[prosperity]] without arrogance; and be ready to let
it go. 

if thou didst ever see a hand cut off, or a foot, or a head, lying
anywhere apart from the rest of the [[body]], such does a [[man]] make himself,
as far as he can, who is not content with what happens, and separates
himself from others, or does anything unsocial. suppose that thou
hast detached thyself from the [[natural]] unity- for thou wast made by
nature a part, but now thou hast cut thyself off- yet here there is
this beautiful provision, that it is in thy [[power]] again to unite thyself.
god has allowed this to no other part, after it has been separated
and cut asunder, to come together again. but consider the kindness
by which he has distinguished [[man]], for he has put it in his power
not to be separated at all from the universal; and when he has been
separated, he has allowed him to return and to be [[united]] and to resume
his place as a part. 

as the [[nature]] of the universal has given to every [[rational]] being all
the other powers [[power]] that it has, so we have received from it this power
also. for as the universal [[nature]] converts and fixes in its predestined
place everything which stands in the way and opposes it, and makes
such things a part of itself, so also the [[rational]] animal is able
to make every hindrance its own material, and to use it for such purposes
as it may have designed. 

do not disturb thyself by thinking of the whole of thy [[life]]. let not
thy thoughts [[thought]] at once embrace all the various troubles which thou mayest
expect to befall thee: but on every [[occasion]] ask thyself, what is
there in this which is intolerable and [[past]] bearing? for thou wilt
be ashamed to confess. in the next place [[remember]] that neither the
future nor the [[past]] pains [[pain]] thee, but only the [[present]]. but this is
reduced to a very little, if thou only circumscribest it, and chidest
thy [[mind]], if it is unable to hold out against even this.

does panthea or pergamus now sit by the tomb of verus? does chaurias
or diotimus sit by the tomb of hadrian? that would be ridiculous.
well, suppose they did sit there, would the [[dead]] be conscious of it?
and if the [[dead]] were conscious, would they be pleased? and if they
were pleased, would that make them [[immortal]]? was it not in the order
of [[destiny]] that these persons [[person]] too should first become old [[women]] and
old [[men]] and then [[die]]? what then would those do after these were [[dead]]?
all this is foul smell and [[blood]] in a bag. 

if thou canst see sharp, look and [[judge]] wisely, says the philosopher.

in the [[constitution]] of the [[rational]] animal i see no [[virtue]] which is
opposed to [[justice]]; but i see a [[virtue]] which is opposed to [[love]] of
pleasure, and that is temperance. 

if thou takest away thy [[opinion]] about that which appears to give thee
pain, thou thyself standest in [[perfect]] security.- who is this [[self]]?-
the [[reason]].- but i am not [[reason]].- be it so. let then the [[reason]] itself
not trouble itself. but if any other part of thee suffers, let it
have its own [[opinion]] about itself. 

hindrance to the perceptions of sense is an [[evil]] to the animal [[nature]].
hindrance to the movements (desires) is equally an [[evil]] to the animal
nature. and something else also is equally an impediment and an evil
to the [[constitution]] of plants. so then that which is a hindrance to
the [[intelligence]] is an [[evil]] to the [[intelligent]] [[nature]]. apply all these
things then to thyself. does [[pain]] or sensuous [[pleasure]] affect thee?
the senses will look to that.- has any obstacle opposed thee in thy
efforts towards an object? if indeed thou wast making this effort
absolutely (unconditionally, or without any reservation), certainly
this obstacle is an [[evil]] to thee considered as a [[rational]] animal.
but if thou takest into consideration the usual course of things,
thou hast not yet been injured nor even impeded. the things however
which are proper to the understanding no other [[man]] is used to impede,
for neither [[fire]], nor iron, nor [[tyrant]], nor [[abuse]], touches it in any
way. when it has been made a sphere, it continues a sphere.

it is not fit that i should give myself [[pain]], for i have never intentionally
given [[pain]] even to another. 

different things delight different [[people]]. but it is my delight to
keep the ruling faculty sound without turning away either from any
man or from any of the things which happen to [[men]], but looking at
and receiving all with welcome [[eyes]] and using everything according
to its value. 

see that thou secure this [[present]] [[time]] to thyself: for those who rather
pursue posthumous fame do consider that the [[men]] of after [[time]] will
be exactly such as these whom they cannot bear now; and both are mortal.
and what is it in any way to thee if these [[men]] of after [[time]] utter
this or that sound, or have this or that [[opinion]] about thee?

take me and cast me where thou wilt; for there i shall keep my divine
part tranquil, that is, content, if it can [[feel]] and act conformably
to its proper [[constitution]]. is this [[change]] of place sufficient reason
why my [[soul]] should be unhappy and worse than it was, depressed, expanded,
shrinking, affrighted? and what wilt thou find which is sufficient
reason for this? 

nothing can happen to any [[man]] which is not a [[human]] accident, nor to
an ox which is not according to the [[nature]] of an ox, nor to a vine
which is not according to the [[nature]] of a vine, nor to a stone which
is not proper to a stone. if then there happens to each thing both
what is usual and [[natural]], why shouldst thou [[complain]]? for the common
nature brings nothing which may not be borne by thee. 

if thou art [[arts]] pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that
disturbs thee, but thy own judgement about it. and it is in thy power
to wipe out this judgement now. but if anything in thy own disposition
gives thee [[pain]], who hinders thee from correcting thy [[opinion]]? and
even if thou art [[arts]] pained because thou art [[arts]] not doing some particular
thing which seems to thee to be [[right]], why dost thou not rather act
than [[complain]]?- but some insuperable obstacle is in the way?- do not
be [[grieved]] then, for the cause of its not being done depends not on
thee.- but it is not worth while to [[live]] if this cannot be done.-
take thy departure then from [[life]] contentedly, just as he dies who
is in full activity, and well pleased too with the things which are
obstacles. 

remember that the ruling faculty is invincible, when self-collected
it is satisfied with itself, if it does nothing which it does not
choose to do, even if it resist from mere obstinacy. what then will
it be when it forms a judgement about anything aided by [[reason]] and
deliberately? therefore the [[mind]] which is [[free]] from [[passions]] is a
citadel, for [[man]] has nothing more secure to which he can fly for,
refuge and for the future be inexpugnable. he then who has not seen
this is an ignorant [[man]]; but he who has seen it and does not fly to
this refuge is unhappy. 

say nothing more to thyself than what the first appearances report.
suppose that it has been reported to thee that a [[certain]] [[person]] speaks
ill of thee. this has been reported; but that thou hast been injured,
that has not been reported. i see that my child is sick. i do see;
but that he is in danger, i do not see. thus then always abide by
the first appearances, and add nothing thyself from within, and then
nothing happens to thee. or rather add something, like a [[man]] who knows
everything that happens in the [[world]]. 

a cucumber is bitter.- throw it away.- there are briars in the road.-
turn aside from them.- this is enough. do not add, and why were such
things made in the [[world]]? for thou wilt be ridiculed by a [[man]] who
is acquainted with [[nature]], as thou wouldst be ridiculed by a carpenter
and shoemaker if thou didst find [[fault]] because thou seest in their
workshop shavings and cuttings from the things which they make. and
yet they have places into which they can throw these shavings and
cuttings, and the universal [[nature]] has no external space; but the
wondrous part of her art [[arts]] is that though she has circumscribed herself,
everything within her which appears to decay and to grow old and to
be useless she changes [[change]] into herself, and again makes other new things
from these very same, so that she requires neither substance from
without nor wants a place into which she may cast that which decays.
she is content then with her own space, and her own matter and her
own art [[arts]]. 

neither in thy actions be sluggish nor in thy conversation without
method, nor wandering in thy thoughts [[thought]], nor let there be in thy soul
inward contention nor external effusion, nor in [[life]] be so busy as
to have no leisure. 

suppose that [[men]] kill thee, cut thee in pieces, curse thee. what then
can these things do to prevent thy [[mind]] from remaining pure, [[wise]],
sober, just? for instance, if a [[man]] should stand by a limpid pure
spring, and curse it, the spring never ceases sending up potable water;
and if he should cast clay into it or filth, it will speedily disperse
them and wash them out, and will not be at all polluted. how then
shalt thou possess a perpetual fountain and not a mere well? by forming
thyself hourly to [[freedom]] conjoined with contentment, simplicity and
modesty. 

he who does not [[know]] what the [[world]] is, does not [[know]] where he is.
and he who does not [[know]] for what [[purpose]] the [[world]] exists, does not
know who he is, nor what the [[world]] is. but he who has failed in any
one of these things could not even say for what [[purpose]] he exists
himself. what then dost thou [[think]] of him who avoids or seeks the
praise of those who applaud, of [[men]] who [[know]] not either where they
are or who they are? 

dost thou [[wish]] to be praised by a [[man]] who curses himself thrice every
hour? wouldst thou [[wish]] to please a [[man]] who does not please himself?
does a [[man]] please himself who repents of nearly everything that he
does? 

no longer let thy breathing only act in concert with the air which
surrounds thee, but let thy [[intelligence]] also now be in harmony with
the [[intelligence]] which embraces all things. for the [[intelligent]] power
is no less diffused in all parts and pervades all things for him who
is willing to draw it to him than the aerial [[power]] for him who is
able to respire it. 

generally, wickedness does no harm at all to the [[universe]]; and particularly,
the wickedness of one [[man]] does no harm to another. it is only harmful
to him who has it in his [[power]] to be released from it, as soon as
he shall choose. 

to my own [[free]] will the [[free]] will of my neighbour is just as indifferent
as his [[poor]] breath and flesh. for though we are made especially for
the sake of one another, still the ruling [[power]] of each of us has
its own office, for otherwise my neighbour's wickedness would be my
harm, which [[god]] has not willed in order that my unhappiness may not
depend on another. 

the sun appears to be poured down, and in all directions indeed it
is diffused, yet it is not effused. for this diffusion is extension:
accordingly its rays are called extensions [aktines] because they
are extended [apo tou ekteinesthai]. but one may [[judge]] what [[kind]] of
a thing a ray is, if he looks at the sun's [[light]] passing through a
narrow opening into a darkened room, for it is extended in a right
line, and as it were is divided when it meets with any solid body
which stands in the way and intercepts the air beyond; but there the
light remains fixed and does not glide or fall off. such then ought
to be the out-pouring and diffusion of the understanding, and it should
in no way be an effusion, but an extension, and it should make no
violent or impetuous collision with the obstacles which are in its
way; nor yet fall down, but be fixed and enlighten that which receives
it. for a [[body]] will deprive itself of the illumination, if it does
not admit it. 

he who fears [[fear]] [[death]] either fears [[fear]] the loss of sensation or a different
kind of sensation. but if thou shalt have no sensation, neither wilt
thou [[feel]] any harm; and if thou shalt acquire another [[kind]] of sensation,
thou wilt be a different [[kind]] of living being and thou wilt not cease
to [[live]]. 

men [[exist]] for the sake of one another. [[teach]] them then or bear with
them. 

in one way an arrow moves, in another way the [[mind]]. the [[mind]] indeed,
both when it exercises caution and when it is employed about inquiry,
moves straight onward not the less, and to its object. 

enter into every man's [[man]] ruling faculty; and also let every other man
enter into thine.

book nine

he ho acts unjustly acts impiously. for since the universal nature
has made [[rational]] animals for the sake of one another to [[help]] one
another according to their deserts, but in no way to injure one another,
he who transgresses her will, is clearly guilty of impiety towards
the highest divinity. and he too who lies [[lie]] is guilty of impiety to
the same divinity; for the universal [[nature]] is the [[nature]] of things
that are; and things that are have a relation to all things that come
into existence. and further, this universal [[nature]] is named [[truth]],
and is the prime cause of all things that are true. he then who lies
intentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as he acts unjustly by
deceiving; and he also who lies [[lie]] unintentionally, inasmuch as he is
at variance with the universal [[nature]], and inasmuch as he disturbs
the order by fighting against the [[nature]] of the [[world]]; for he fights
against it, who is moved of himself to that which is contrary to [[truth]],
for he had received powers [[power]] from [[nature]] through the neglect of which
he is not able now to distinguish falsehood from [[truth]]. and indeed
he who pursues [[pleasure]] as [[good]], and avoids [[pain]] as [[evil]], is guilty
of impiety. for of necessity such a [[man]] must often find [[fault]] with
the universal [[nature]], alleging that it assigns things to the [[bad]] and
the [[good]] contrary to their deserts, because frequently the [[bad]] are
in the enjoyment of [[pleasure]] and possess the things which procure
pleasure, but the [[good]] have [[pain]] for their share and the things which
cause [[pain]]. and further, he who is afraid of [[pain]] will sometimes also
be afraid of some of the things which will happen in the [[world]], and
even this is impiety. and he who pursues [[pleasure]] will not abstain
from [[injustice]], and this is plainly impiety. now with [[respect]] to the
things towards which the universal [[nature]] is equally affected- for
it would not have made both, unless it was equally affected towards
both- towards these they who [[wish]] to [[follow]] [[nature]] should be of the
same [[mind]] with it, and equally affected. with [[respect]] to [[pain]], then,
and [[pleasure]], or [[death]] and [[life]], or [[honour]] and dishonour, which the
universal [[nature]] employs equally, whoever is not equally affected
is manifestly acting impiously. and i say that the universal nature
employs them equally, instead of saying that they happen alike to
those who are produced in continuous series and to those who come
after them by [[virtue]] of a [[certain]] original movement of providence,
according to which it moved from a [[certain]] beginning to this ordering
of things, having conceived [[certain]] principles [[principle]] of the things which
were to be, and having determined powers [[power]] productive of beings and
of changes [[change]] and of such like successions. 

it would be a man's [[man]] happiest lot to depart from [[mankind]] without having
had any taste of lying and hypocrisy and luxury and [[pride]]. however
to breathe out one's [[life]] when a [[man]] has had enough of these things
is the next [[best]] [[voyage]], as the saying is. hast thou determined to
abide with [[vice]], and has not [[experience]] yet induced thee to fly from
this pestilence? for the destruction of the understanding is a pestilence,
much more indeed than any such [[corruption]] and [[change]] of this atmosphere
which surrounds us. for this [[corruption]] is a pestilence of animals
so far as they are animals; but the other is a pestilence of [[men]] so
far as they are [[men]]. 

do not despise [[death]], but be well content with it, since this too
is one of those things which [[nature]] wills. for such as it is to be
young and to grow old, and to increase and to reach maturity, and
to have teeth and beard and grey hairs, and to beget, and to be pregnant
and to bring forth, and all the other [[natural]] operations which the
seasons of thy [[life]] bring, such also is dissolution. this, then, is
consistent with the [[character]] of a reflecting [[man]], to be neither careless
nor impatient nor contemptuous with [[respect]] to [[death]], but to wait
for it as one of the operations of [[nature]]. as thou now waitest for
the [[time]] when the child shall come out of thy wife's womb, so be ready
for the [[time]] when thy [[soul]] shall fall out of this envelope. but if
thou requirest also a vulgar [[kind]] of comfort which shall reach thy
heart, thou wilt be made [[best]] reconciled to [[death]] by observing the
objects from which thou art [[arts]] going to be removed, and the morals [[moral]] of
those with whom thy [[soul]] will no longer be mingled. for it is no way
right to be offended with [[men]], but it is thy [[duty]] to [[care]] for them
and to bear with them gently; and yet to [[remember]] that thy departure
will be not from [[men]] who have the same principles [[principle]] as thyself. for
this is the only thing, if there be any, which could draw us the contrary
way and attach us to [[life]], to be permitted to [[live]] with those who
have the same principles [[principle]] as ourselves. but now thou seest how great
is the trouble arising from the discordance of those who [[live]] together,
so that thou mayest say, come quick, o [[death]], lest perchance i, too,
should forget myself. 

he who does [[wrong]] does [[wrong]] against himself. he who acts unjustly
acts unjustly to himself, because he makes himself [[bad]]. 

he often acts unjustly who does not do a [[certain]] thing; not only he
who does a [[certain]] thing. 

thy [[present]] [[opinion]] founded on understanding, and thy [[present]] conduct
directed to social [[good]], and thy [[present]] disposition of contentment
with everything which happens- that is enough. 

wipe out [[imagination]]: check [[desire]]: extinguish appetite: keep the
ruling faculty in its own [[power]]. 

among the animals which have not [[reason]] one [[life]] is distributed; but
among reasonable animals one [[intelligent]] [[soul]] is distributed: just
as there is one [[earth]] of all things which are of an earthy [[nature]],
and we see by one [[light]], and breathe one air, all of us that have
the faculty of vision and all that have [[life]]. 

all things which participate in anything which is [[common]] to them all
move towards that which is of the same [[kind]] with themselves. everything
which is earthy turns towards the [[earth]], everything which is liquid
flows together, and everything which is of an aerial [[kind]] does the
same, so that they require something to keep them asunder, and the
application of [[force]]. [[fire]] indeed moves upwards on account of the
elemental [[fire]], but it is so ready to be kindled together with all
the [[fire]] which is here, that even every substance which is somewhat
dry, is easily ignited, because there is less mingled with it of that
which is a hindrance to ignition. accordingly then everything also
which participates in the [[common]] [[intelligent]] [[nature]] moves in like
manner towards that which is of the same [[kind]] with itself, or moves
even more. for so much as it is superior in comparison with all other
things, in the same [[degree]] also is it more ready to mingle with and
to be fused with that which is akin to it. accordingly among animals
devoid of [[reason]] we find swarms of bees, and herds of cattle, and
the nurture of [[young]] birds, and in a manner, loves [[love]]; for even in animals
there are souls [[soul]], and that [[power]] which brings them together is seen
to exert itself in the superior [[degree]], and in such a way as never
has been observed in plants nor in stones nor in trees. but in rational
animals there are [[political]] communities [[community]] and friendships [[friendship]], and families
and meetings of [[people]]; and in wars [[war]], treaties and armistices. but
in the things which are still superior, even though they are separated
from one another, unity in a manner exists, as in the stars. thus
the ascent to the higher [[degree]] is able to [[produce]] a sympathy even
in things which are separated. see, then, what now takes place. for
only [[intelligent]] animals have now forgotten this mutual [[desire]] and
inclination, and in them alone the [[property]] of flowing together is
not seen. but still though [[men]] strive to avoid this union, they are
caught and held by it, for their [[nature]] is too [[strong]] for them; and
thou wilt see what i say, if thou only observest. sooner, then, will
one find anything earthy which comes in contact with no earthy thing
than a [[man]] altogether separated from other [[men]]. 

both [[man]] and [[god]] and the [[universe]] [[produce]] fruit; at the proper seasons
each produces [[produce]] it. but if usage has especially fixed these terms to
the vine and like things, this is nothing. [[reason]] produces [[produce]] fruit both
for all and for itself, and there are produced from it other things
of the same [[kind]] as [[reason]] itself. 

if thou art [[arts]] able, [[correct]] by teaching those who do [[wrong]]; but if thou
canst not, [[remember]] that indulgence is given to thee for this [[purpose]].
and the gods, too, are indulgent to such persons [[person]]; and for some purposes
they even [[help]] them to get health, [[wealth]], [[reputation]]; so [[kind]] they
are. and it is in thy [[power]] also; or say, who hinders thee?

labour not as one who is wretched, nor yet as one who would be pitied
or admired: but direct thy will to one thing only, to put thyself
in motion and to check thyself, as the social [[reason]] requires.

to-day i have got out of all trouble, or rather i have cast out all
trouble, for it was not outside, but within and in my opinions [[opinion]].

all things are the same, familiar in [[experience]], and ephemeral in
time, and worthless in the matter. everything now is just as it was
in the [[time]] of those whom we have buried. 

things stand outside of us, themselves by themselves, neither knowing
aught of themselves, nor expressing any judgement. what is it, then,
which does [[judge]] about them? the ruling faculty. 

not in passivity, but in activity [[lie]] the [[evil]] and the [[good]] of the
rational social animal, just as his [[virtue]] and his [[vice]] [[lie]] not in
passivity, but in activity. 

for the stone which has been thrown up it is no [[evil]] to come down,
nor indeed any [[good]] to have been carried up. 

penetrate inwards into men's leading principles [[principle]], and thou wilt see
what judges [[judge]] thou art [[arts]] afraid of, and what [[kind]] of judges [[judge]] they are of
themselves. 

all things are changing: and thou thyself art [[arts]] in continuous mutation
and in a manner in continuous destruction, and the whole universe
too. 

it is thy [[duty]] to leave another man's [[man]] wrongful act there where it
is. 

termination of activity, cessation from movement and [[opinion]], and
in a sense their [[death]], is no [[evil]]. turn thy thoughts [[thought]] now to the consideration
of thy [[life]], thy [[life]] as a child, as a [[youth]], thy manhood, thy old
age, for in these also every [[change]] was a [[death]]. is this anything
to [[fear]]? turn thy thoughts [[thought]] now to thy [[life]] under thy grandfather,
then to thy [[life]] under thy [[mother]], then to thy [[life]] under thy [[father]];
and as thou findest many other differences and changes [[change]] and terminations,
ask thyself, is this anything to [[fear]]? in like manner, then, neither
are the termination and cessation and [[change]] of thy whole [[life]] a thing
to be afraid of. 

hasten to examine thy own ruling faculty and that of the universe
and that of thy neighbour: thy own that thou mayest make it just:
and that of the [[universe]], that thou mayest [[remember]] of what thou art
a part; and that of thy neighbour, that thou mayest [[know]] whether he
has acted ignorantly or with [[knowledge]], and that thou mayest also
consider that his ruling faculty is akin to thine. 

as thou thyself art [[arts]] a component part of a social [[system]], so let every
act of thine be a component part of social [[life]]. whatever act of thine
then has no reference either immediately or remotely to a social end,
this tears asunder thy [[life]], and does not allow it to be one, and
it is of the [[nature]] of a mutiny, just as when in a popular assembly
a [[man]] acting by himself stands apart from the general agreement.

quarrels of little [[children]] and their sports [[sport]], and [[poor]] spirits carrying
about [[dead]] bodies [[body]], such is everything; and so what is exhibited in
the representation of the mansions of the [[dead]] strikes our [[eyes]] more
clearly. 

examine into the quality of the form of an object, and detach it altogether
from its material part, and then contemplate it; then determine the
time, the longest which a thing of this peculiar form is naturally
made to endure. 

thou hast endured infinite troubles through not being contented with
thy ruling faculty, when it does the things which it is constituted
by [[nature]] to do. but enough of this. 

when another blames thee or hates thee, or when [[men]] say about thee
anything injurious, approach their [[poor]] souls [[soul]], penetrate within, and
see what [[kind]] of [[men]] they are. thou wilt discover that there is no
reason to take any trouble that these [[men]] may have this or that opinion
about thee. however thou must be well disposed towards them, for by
nature they are [[friends]]. and the gods too aid them in all ways, by
dreams, by signs, towards the attainment of those things on which
they set a value. 

the periodic movements of the [[universe]] are the same, up and down from
age to [[age]]. and either the universal [[intelligence]] puts itself in motion
for every separate effect, and if this is so, be thou content with
that which is the result of its activity; or it puts itself in motion
once, and everything else comes by way of sequence in a manner; or
indivisible elements are the origin of all things.- in a word, if
there is a [[god]], all is well; and if [[chance]] rules [[rule]], do not thou also
be governed by it. 

soon will the [[earth]] cover us all: then the [[earth]], too, will [[change]],
and the things also which result from [[change]] will continue to change
for ever, and these again for ever. for if a [[man]] reflects on the changes
and transformations which [[follow]] one another like wave after wave
and their rapidity, he will despise everything which is perishable.

the universal cause is like a winter torrent: it carries everything
along with it. but how worthless are all these [[poor]] [[people]] who are
engaged in matters [[political]], and, as they suppose, are playing the
philosopher! all drivellers. well then, [[man]]: do what [[nature]] now requires.
set thyself in motion, if it is in thy [[power]], and do not look about
thee to see if any one will observe it; nor yet expect plato's [[republic]]:
but be content if the smallest thing goes on well, and consider such
an event to be no small matter. for who can [[change]] men's opinions [[opinion]]?
and without a [[change]] of opinions [[opinion]] what else is there than the slavery
of [[men]] who groan while they pretend to obey? come now and tell me
of alexander and philip and demetrius of phalerum. they themselves
shall [[judge]] whether they discovered what the [[common]] [[nature]] required,
and trained themselves accordingly. but if they acted like tragedy
heroes, no one has condemned me to imitate them. simple and modest
is the [[work]] of [[philosophy]]. draw me not aside to indolence and [[pride]].

look down from above on the countless herds of [[men]] and their countless
solemnities, and the infinitely varied voyagings in storms and calms,
and the differences among those who are born, who [[live]] together, and
die. and consider, too, the [[life]] lived by others in olden [[time]], and
the [[life]] of those who will [[live]] after thee, and the [[life]] now lived
among barbarous nations, and how many [[know]] not even thy name, and
how many will soon forget it, and how they who perhaps now are praising
thee will very soon blame thee, and that neither a posthumous name
is of any value, nor [[reputation]], nor anything else. 

let there be [[freedom]] from perturbations with [[respect]] to the things
which come from the external cause; and let there be [[justice]] in the
things done by [[virtue]] of the internal cause, that is, let there be
movement and action terminating in this, in social acts, for this
is according to thy [[nature]]. 

thou canst remove out of the way many useless things among those which
disturb thee, for they [[lie]] entirely in thy [[opinion]]; and thou wilt
then gain for thyself ample space by comprehending the whole universe
in thy [[mind]], and by contemplating the eternity of [[time]], and observing
the rapid [[change]] of every several thing, how short is the [[time]] from
birth to dissolution, and the illimitable [[time]] before birth as well
as the equally boundless [[time]] after dissolution. 

all that thou seest will quickly perish, and those who have been spectators
of its dissolution will very soon perish too. and he who dies at the
extremest old [[age]] will be brought into the same condition with him
who died prematurely. 

what are these men's leading principles [[principle]], and about what [[kind]] of things
are they busy, and for what [[kind]] of reasons [[reason]] do they [[love]] and [[honour]]?
imagine that thou seest their [[poor]] souls [[soul]] laid bare. when they think
that they do harm by their blame or [[good]] by their [[praise]], what an
idea! 

loss is nothing else than [[change]]. but the universal [[nature]] delights
in [[change]], and in [[obedience]] to her all things are now done well, and
from eternity have been done in like form, and will be such to time
without end. what, then, dost thou say? that all things have been
and all things always will be [[bad]], and that no [[power]] has ever been
found in so many gods to rectify these things, but the [[world]] has been
condemned to be found in never ceasing [[evil]]? 

the rottenness of the matter which is the foundation of everything!
water, dust, bones, filth: or again, marble rocks, the callosities
of the [[earth]]; and gold and silver, the sediments; and garments, only
bits of hair; and purple dye, [[blood]]; and everything else is of the
same [[kind]]. and that which is of the [[nature]] of breath is also another
thing of the same [[kind]], changing from this to that. 

enough of this wretched [[life]] and murmuring and apish tricks. why art
thou disturbed? what is there new in this? what unsettles thee? is
it the form of the thing? look at it. or is it the matter? look at
it. but besides these there is nothing. towards the gods, then, now
become at [[last]] more simple and [[better]]. it is the same whether we examine
these things for a hundred years or three. 

if any [[man]] has done [[wrong]], the harm is his own. but perhaps he has
not done [[wrong]]. 

either all things proceed from one [[intelligent]] source and come together
as in one [[body]], and the part ought not to find [[fault]] with what is
done for the benefit of the whole; or there are only atoms, and nothing
else than mixture and dispersion. why, then, art [[arts]] thou disturbed? say
to the ruling faculty, art [[arts]] thou [[dead]], art [[arts]] thou corrupted, art [[arts]] thou
playing the hypocrite, art [[arts]] thou become a beast, dost thou herd and
feed with the rest? 

either the gods have no [[power]] or they have [[power]]. if, then, they have
no [[power]], why dost thou [[pray]] to them? but if they have [[power]], why
dost thou not [[pray]] for them to give thee the faculty of not fearing
any of the things which thou fearest, or of not desiring any of the
things which thou desirest, or not being pained at anything, rather
than [[pray]] that any of these things should not happen or happen? for
certainly if they can co-operate with [[men]], they can co-operate for
these purposes [[purpose]]. but perhaps thou wilt say, the gods have placed them
in thy [[power]]. well, then, is it not [[better]] to use what is in thy power
like a [[free]] [[man]] than to [[desire]] in a slavish and abject way what is
not in thy [[power]]? and who has told thee that the gods do not aid us
even in the things which are in our [[power]]? begin, then, to [[pray]] for
such things, and thou wilt see. one [[man]] prays thus: how shall i be
able to [[lie]] with that woman? do thou [[pray]] thus: how shall i not desire
to [[lie]] with her? another prays thus: how shall i be released from
this? another prays: how shall i not [[desire]] to be released? another
thus: how shall i not lose my little [[son]]? thou thus: how shall i not
be afraid to lose him? in fine, turn thy prayers this way, and see
what comes. 

epicurus says, in my sickness my conversation was not about my bodily
sufferings, nor, says he, did i talk on such subjects [[subject]] to those who
visited me; but i continued to discourse on the [[nature]] of things as
before, keeping to this main point, how the [[mind]], while participating
in such movements as go on in the [[poor]] flesh, shall be [[free]] from perturbations
and maintain its proper [[good]]. nor did i, he says, give the physicians
an opportunity of putting on solemn looks, as if they were doing something
great, but my [[life]] went on well and happily. do, then, the same that
he did both in sickness, if thou art [[arts]] sick, and in any other circumstances;
for never to desert [[philosophy]] in any events that may befall us, nor
to hold trifling talk either with an ignorant [[man]] or with one unacquainted
with [[nature]], is a [[principle]] of all schools of [[philosophy]]; but to be
intent only on that which thou art [[arts]] now doing and on the instrument
by which thou doest it. 

when thou art [[arts]] offended with any man's [[man]] shameless conduct, immediately
ask thyself, is it possible, then, that shameless [[men]] should not be
in the [[world]]? it is not possible. do not, then, require what is impossible.
for this [[man]] also is one of those shameless [[men]] who must of necessity
be in the [[world]]. let the same considerations be [[present]] to thy mind
in the case of the knave, and the faithless [[man]], and of every man
who does [[wrong]] in any way. for at the same [[time]] that thou dost remind
thyself that it is impossible that such [[kind]] of [[men]] should not [[exist]],
thou wilt become more kindly disposed towards every one individually.
it is useful to perceive this, too, immediately when the occasion
arises, what [[virtue]] [[nature]] has given to [[man]] to oppose to every wrongful
act. for she has given to [[man]], as an antidote against the stupid [[man]],
mildness, and against another [[kind]] of [[man]] some other [[power]]. and in
all cases it is possible for thee to [[correct]] by teaching the [[man]] who
is gone astray; for every [[man]] who errs misses his object and is gone
astray. besides wherein hast thou been injured? for thou wilt find
that no one among those against whom thou art [[arts]] irritated has done anything
by which thy [[mind]] could be made worse; but that which is [[evil]] to thee
and harmful has its foundation only in the [[mind]]. and what harm is
done or what is there [[strange]], if the [[man]] who has not been instructed
does the acts of an uninstructed [[man]]? consider whether thou shouldst
not rather blame thyself, because thou didst not expect such a man
to err in such a way. for thou hadst means given thee by thy reason
to suppose that it was likely that he would commit this error, and
yet thou hast forgotten and art [[arts]] amazed that he has erred. but most
of all when thou blamest a [[man]] as faithless or ungrateful, turn to
thyself. for the [[fault]] is manifestly thy own, whether thou didst trust
that a [[man]] who had such a disposition would keep his promise, or when
conferring thy [[kindness]] thou didst not confer it absolutely, nor yet
in such way as to have received from thy very act all the [[profit]].
for what more dost thou want when thou hast done a [[man]] a service?
art thou not content that thou hast done something conformable to
thy [[nature]], and dost thou seek to be paid for it? just as if the eye
demanded a recompense for seeing, or the feet for walking. for as
these members are formed for a particular [[purpose]], and by working
according to their several constitutions [[constitution]] obtain what is their own;
so also as [[man]] is formed by [[nature]] to acts of benevolence, when he
has done anything benevolent or in any other way conducive to the
common interest, he has acted conformably to his [[constitution]], and
he gets what is his own.

book ten

wilt thou, then, my [[soul]], never be [[good]] and simple and one and naked,
more manifest than the [[body]] which surrounds thee? wilt thou never
enjoy an affectionate and contented disposition? wilt thou never be
full and without a want of any [[kind]], longing for nothing more, nor
desiring anything, either animate or inanimate, for the enjoyment
of pleasures [[pleasure]]? nor yet desiring [[time]] wherein thou shalt have longer
enjoyment, or place, or pleasant [[climate]], or [[society]] of [[men]] with whom
thou mayest [[live]] in harmony? but wilt thou be satisfied with thy present
condition, and pleased with all that is about thee, and wilt thou
convince thyself that thou hast everything and that it comes from
the gods, that everything is well for thee, and will be well whatever
shall please them, and whatever they shall give for the conservation
of the [[perfect]] living being, the [[good]] and just and beautiful, which
generates and holds together all things, and contains and embraces
all things which are dissolved for the production of other like things?
wilt thou never be such that thou shalt so dwell in [[community]] with
gods and [[men]] as neither to find [[fault]] with them at all, nor to be
condemned by them? 

observe what thy [[nature]] requires, so far as thou art [[arts]] governed by nature
only: then do it and accept it, if thy [[nature]], so far as thou art
a living being, shall not be made worse by it. 

and next thou must observe what thy [[nature]] requires so far as thou
art a living being. and all this thou mayest allow thyself, if thy
nature, so far as thou art [[arts]] a [[rational]] animal, shall not be made worse
by it. but the [[rational]] animal is consequently also a [[political]] (social)
animal. use these rules [[rule]], then, and trouble thyself about nothing else.

everything which happens either happens in such [[wise]] as thou art [[arts]] formed
by [[nature]] to bear it, or as thou art [[arts]] not formed by [[nature]] to bear
it. if, then, it happens to thee in such way as thou art [[arts]] formed by
nature to bear it, do not [[complain]], but bear it as thou art [[arts]] formed
by [[nature]] to bear it. but if it happens in such [[wise]] as thou art [[arts]] not
formed by [[nature]] to bear it, do not [[complain]], for it will perish after
it has consumed thee. [[remember]], however, that thou art [[arts]] formed by nature
to bear everything, with [[respect]] to which it depends on thy own opinion
to make it endurable and tolerable, by thinking that it is either
thy interest or thy [[duty]] to do this. 

if a [[man]] is mistaken, instruct him kindly and show him his error.
but if thou art [[arts]] not able, blame thyself, or blame not even thyself.

whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared for thee from all eternity;
and the implication of causes was from eternity spinning the thread
of thy being, and of that which is incident to it. 

whether the [[universe]] is a concourse of atoms, or [[nature]] is a [[system]],
let this first be established, that i am a part of the whole which
is governed by [[nature]]; next, i am in a manner intimately related to
the parts which are of the same [[kind]] with myself. for remembering
this, inasmuch as i am a part, i shall be discontented with none of
the things which are assigned to me out of the whole; for nothing
is injurious to the part, if it is for the advantage of the whole.
for the whole contains nothing which is not for its advantage; and
all natures [[nature]] indeed have this [[common]] [[principle]], but the [[nature]] of the
universe has this [[principle]] besides, that it cannot be compelled even
by any external cause to generate anything harmful to itself. by remembering,
then, that i am a part of such a whole, i shall be content with everything
that happens. and inasmuch as i am in a manner intimately related
to the parts which are of the same [[kind]] with myself, i shall do nothing
unsocial, but i shall rather direct myself to the things which are
of the same [[kind]] with myself, and i shall turn an my efforts to the
common interest, and divert them from the contrary. now, if these
things are done so, [[life]] must flow on happily, just as thou mayest
observe that the [[life]] of a citizen is [[happy]], who continues a course
of action which is advantageous to his fellow-citizens, and is content
with whatever the [[state]] may assign to him. 

the parts of the whole, everything, i mean, which is naturally comprehended
in the [[universe]], must of necessity perish; but let this be understood
in this sense, that they must undergo [[change]]. but if this is naturally
both an [[evil]] and a necessity for the parts, the whole would not continue
to [[exist]] in a [[good]] condition, the parts being [[subject]] to [[change]] and
constituted so as to perish in various ways. for whether did nature
herself design to do [[evil]] to the things which are parts of herself,
and to make them [[subject]] to [[evil]] and of necessity fall into [[evil]],
or have such results happened without her knowing it? both these suppositions,
indeed, are incredible. but if a [[man]] should even drop the term nature
(as an efficient power), and should speak of these things as [[natural]],
even then it would be ridiculous to affirm at the same [[time]] that the
parts of the whole are in their [[nature]] [[subject]] to [[change]], and at the
same [[time]] to be surprised or vexed as if something were happening
contrary to [[nature]], particularly as the dissolution of things is into
those things of which each thing is composed. for there is either
a dispersion of the elements out of which everything has been compounded,
or a [[change]] from the solid to the earthy and from the airy to the
aerial, so that these parts are taken back into the universal [[reason]],
whether this at [[certain]] periods is consumed by [[fire]] or renewed by
eternal changes [[change]]. and do not imagine that the solid and the airy part
belong to thee from the [[time]] of [[generation]]. for all this received
its accretion only yesterday and the day before, as one may say, from
the food and the air which is inspired. this, then, which has received
the accretion, changes [[change]], not that which thy [[mother]] brought forth. but
suppose that this which thy [[mother]] brought forth implicates thee very
much with that other part, which has the peculiar quality of [[change]],
this is nothing in [[fact]] in the way of objection to what is said.

when thou hast assumed these names, [[good]], modest, true, [[rational]],
a [[man]] of equanimity, and magnanimous, take [[care]] that thou dost not
change these names; and if thou shouldst lose them, quickly return
to them. and [[remember]] that the term [[rational]] was intended to signify
a discriminating attention to every several thing and [[freedom]] from
negligence; and that equanimity is the voluntary acceptance of the
things which are assigned to thee by the [[common]] [[nature]]; and that magnanimity
is the elevation of the [[intelligent]] part above the pleasurable or
painful sensations of the flesh, and above that [[poor]] thing called
fame, and [[death]], and all such things. if, then, thou maintainest thyself
in the possession of these names, without desiring to be called by
these names by others, thou wilt be another [[person]] and wilt enter
on another [[life]]. for to continue to be such as thou hast hitherto
been, and to be tom in pieces and defiled in such a [[life]], is the character
of a very stupid [[man]] and one overfond of his [[life]], and like those
half-devoured fighters with wild beasts, who though covered with wounds
and gore, still intreat to be kept to the following day, though they
will be exposed in the same [[state]] to the same claws and bites. therefore
fix thyself in the possession of these few names: and if thou art
able to abide in them, abide as if thou wast removed to [[certain]] islands
of the [[happy]]. but if thou shalt perceive that thou fallest out of
them and dost not maintain thy hold, go courageously into some nook
where thou shalt maintain them, or even depart at once from [[life]],
not in passion, but with simplicity and [[freedom]] and modesty, after
doing this one laudable thing at least in thy [[life]], to have gone out
of it thus. in order, however, to the remembrance of these names,
it will greatly [[help]] thee, if thou rememberest the gods, and that
they [[wish]] not to be flattered, but [[wish]] all reasonable beings to be
made like themselves; and if thou rememberest that what does the work
of a fig-tree is a fig-tree, and that what does the [[work]] of a dog
is a dog, and that what does the [[work]] of a bee is a bee, and that
what does the [[work]] of a [[man]] is a [[man]]. 

mimi, [[war]], astonishment, torpor, [[slavery]], will daily wipe out those
holy principles [[principle]] of thine. how many things without studying nature
dost thou imagine, and how many dost thou neglect? but it is thy duty
so to look on and so to do everything, that at the same [[time]] the power
of dealing with circumstances is perfected, and the contemplative
faculty is exercised, and the confidence which comes from the knowledge
of each several thing is maintained without showing it, but yet not
concealed. for when wilt thou enjoy simplicity, when gravity, and
when the [[knowledge]] of every several thing, both what it is in substance,
and what place it has in the [[universe]], and how long it is formed to
exist and of what things it is compounded, and to whom it can belong,
and who are able both to give it and take it away? 

a spider is proud when it has caught a fly, and another when he has
caught a [[poor]] hare, and another when he has taken a little fish in
a net, and another when he has taken wild boars, and another when
he has taken bears, and another when he has taken sarmatians. are
not these robbers, if thou examinest their opinions [[opinion]]? 

acquire the contemplative way of seeing how all things [[change]] into
one another, and constantly attend to it, and exercise thyself about
this part of [[philosophy]]. for nothing is so much adapted to produce
magnanimity. such a [[man]] has put off the [[body]], and as he sees that
he must, no one knows [[know]] how soon, go away from among [[men]] and leave everything
here, he gives himself up entirely to just doing in all his actions,
and in everything else that happens he resigns himself to the universal
nature. but as to what any [[man]] shall say or [[think]] about him or do
against him, he never even thinks [[think]] of it, being himself contented with
these two things, with acting justly in what he now does, and being
satisfied with what is now assigned to him; and he lays aside all
distracting and busy pursuits, and desires [[desire]] nothing else than to accomplish
the straight course through the [[law]], and by accomplishing the straight
course to [[follow]] [[god]]. 

what need is there of suspicious [[fear]], since it is in thy [[power]] to
inquire what ought to be done? and if thou seest clear, go by this
way content, without turning back: but if thou dost not see clear,
stop and take the [[best]] advisers. but if any other things oppose thee,
go on according to thy powers [[power]] with due consideration, keeping to that
which appears to be just. for it is [[best]] to reach this object, and
if thou dost fail, let thy failure be in attempting this. he who follows
reason in all things is both tranquil and active at the same [[time]],
and also cheerful and collected. 

inquire of thyself as soon as thou wakest from sleep, whether it will
make any difference to thee, if another does what is just and [[right]].
it will make no difference. 

thou hast not forgotten, i suppose, that those who assume arrogant
airs in bestowing their [[praise]] or blame on others, are such as they
are at bed and at board, and thou hast not forgotten what they do,
and what they avoid and what they pursue, and how they steal and how
they rob, not with hands and feet, but with their most valuable part,
by means of which there is produced, when a [[man]] chooses, fidelity,
modesty, [[truth]], [[law]], a [[good]] daemon (happiness)? 

to her who gives and takes back all, to [[nature]], the [[man]] who is instructed
and modest says, give what thou wilt; take back what thou wilt. and
he says this not proudly, but obediently and well pleased with her.

short is the little which remains to thee of [[life]]. [[live]] as on a mountain.
for it makes no difference whether a [[man]] lives [[life]] there or here, if he
lives everywhere in the [[world]] as in a [[state]] (political community).
let [[men]] see, let them [[know]] a real [[man]] who lives [[life]] according to [[nature]].
if they cannot endure him, let them kill him. for that is [[better]] than
to [[live]] thus as [[men]] do. 

no longer talk at all about the [[kind]] of [[man]] that a [[good]] [[man]] ought
to be, but be such. 

constantly contemplate the whole of [[time]] and the whole of substance,
and consider that all [[individual]] things as to substance are a grain
of a fig, and as to [[time]], the turning of a gimlet. 

look at everything that exists, and observe that it is already in
dissolution and in [[change]], and as it were putrefaction or dispersion,
or that everything is so constituted by [[nature]] as to [[die]].

consider what [[men]] are when they are eating, sleeping, generating,
easing themselves and so forth. then what [[kind]] of [[men]] they are when
they are imperious and arrogant, or angry and scolding from their
elevated place. but a short [[time]] ago to how many they were slaves
and for what things; and after a little [[time]] consider in what a condition
they will be. 

that is for the [[good]] of each thing, which the universal [[nature]] brings
to each. and it is for its [[good]] at the [[time]] when [[nature]] brings it.

"the [[earth]] loves [[love]] the shower"; and "the solemn aether loves": and the
universe loves [[love]] to make whatever is about to be. i say then to the
universe, that i [[love]] as thou lovest. and is not this too said, that
"this or that loves [[love]] (is wont) to be produced"? 

either thou livest here and hast already accustomed thyself to it,
or thou art [[arts]] going away, and this was thy own will; or thou art [[arts]] dying
and hast discharged thy [[duty]]. but besides these things there is nothing.
be of [[good]] cheer, then. 

let this always be plain to thee, that this piece of [[land]] is like
any other; and that all things here are the same with things on top
of a mountain, or on the sea-shore, or wherever thou choosest to be.
for thou wilt find just what [[plato]] says, dwelling within the walls
of a [[city]] as in a shepherd's fold on a mountain. 

what is my ruling faculty now to me? and of what [[nature]] am i now making
it? and for what [[purpose]] am i now using it? is it void of understanding?
is it loosed and rent asunder from social [[life]]? is it melted into
and mixed with the [[poor]] flesh so as to move together with it?

he who flies from his master is a runaway; but the [[law]] is master,
and he who breaks the [[law]] is a runaway. and he also who is grieved
or angry or afraid, is dissatisfied because something has been or
is or shall be of the things which are appointed by him who rules
all things, and he is [[law]], and assigns to every [[man]] what is fit. he
then who fears [[fear]] or is [[grieved]] or is angry is a runaway. 

a [[man]] deposits seed in a womb and goes away, and then another cause
takes it, and labours [[labour]] on it and makes a child. what a thing from such
a material! again, the child passes food down through the throat,
and then another cause takes it and makes perception and motion, and
in fine [[life]] and [[strength]] and other things; how many and how strange
i observe then the things which are produced in such a hidden way,
and see the [[power]] just as we see the [[power]] which carries things downwards
and upwards, not with the [[eyes]], but still no less plainly.

constantly consider how all things such as they now are, in [[time]] past
also were; and consider that they will be the same again. and place
before thy [[eyes]] entire dramas and stages of the same form, whatever
thou hast learned from thy [[experience]] or from older [[history]]; for [[example]],
the whole court of hadrian, and the whole court of antoninus, and
the whole court of philip, alexander, croesus; for all those were
such dramas as we see now, only with different actors. 

imagine every [[man]] who is [[grieved]] at anything or discontented to be
like a pig which is sacrificed and kicks and screams. 

like this pig also is he who on his bed in [[silence]] laments the bonds
in which we are held. and consider that only to the [[rational]] animal
is it given to [[follow]] voluntarily what happens; but simply to follow
is a necessity imposed on all. 

severally on the [[occasion]] of everything that thou doest, pause and
ask thyself, if [[death]] is a dreadful thing because it deprives thee
of this. 

when thou art [[arts]] offended at any man's [[man]] [[fault]], forthwith turn to thyself
and reflect in what like manner thou dost err thyself; for [[example]],
in thinking that [[money]] is a [[good]] thing, or [[pleasure]], or a bit of [[reputation]],
and the like. for by attending to this thou wilt quickly forget thy
anger, if this consideration also is added, that the [[man]] is compelled:
for what else could he do? or, if thou art [[arts]] able, take away from him
the compulsion. 

when thou hast seen satyron the socratic, [[think]] of either eutyches
or hymen, and when thou hast seen euphrates, [[think]] of eutychion or
silvanus, and when thou hast seen alciphron [[think]] of tropaeophorus,
and when thou hast seen xenophon [[think]] of crito or severus, and when
thou hast looked on thyself, [[think]] of any other caesar, and in the
case of every one do in like manner. then let this [[thought]] be in thy
mind, where then are those [[men]]? nowhere, or nobody knows [[know]] where. for
thus continuously thou wilt look at [[human]] things as smoke and nothing
at all; especially if thou reflectest at the same [[time]] that what has
once changed will never [[exist]] again in the infinite duration of [[time]].
but thou, in what a brief space of [[time]] is thy existence? and why
art thou not content to pass through this short [[time]] in an orderly
way? what matter and opportunity for thy activity art [[arts]] thou avoiding?
for what else are all these things, except exercises for the [[reason]],
when it has viewed carefully and by examination into their nature
the things which happen in [[life]]? persevere then until thou shalt have
made these things thy own, as the stomach which is strengthened makes
all things its own, as the blazing [[fire]] makes flame and brightness
out of everything that is thrown into it. 

let it not be in any man's [[man]] [[power]] to say truly of thee that thou art
not simple or that thou are not [[good]]; but let him be a liar whoever
shall [[think]] anything of this [[kind]] about thee; and this is altogether
in thy [[power]]. for who is he that shall hinder thee from being good
and simple? do thou only determine to [[live]] no longer, unless thou
shalt be such. for neither does [[reason]] allow thee to [[live]], if thou
art not such. 

what is that which as to this material (our life) can be done or said
in the way most conformable to [[reason]]. for whatever this may be, it
is in thy [[power]] to do it or to say it, and do not make excuses that
thou art [[arts]] hindered. thou wilt not cease to lament till thy [[mind]] is
in such a condition that, what luxury is to those who enjoy [[pleasure]],
such shall be to thee, in the matter which is subjected and presented
to thee, the doing of the things which are conformable to man's [[man]] [[constitution]];
for a [[man]] ought to consider as an enjoyment everything which it is
in his [[power]] to do according to his own [[nature]]. and it is in his power
everywhere. now, it is not given to a cylinder to move everywhere
by its own motion, nor yet to water nor to [[fire]], nor to anything else
which is governed by [[nature]] or an irrational [[soul]], for the things
which check them and stand in the way are many. but [[intelligence]] and
reason are able to go through everything that opposes them, and in
such manner as they are formed by [[nature]] and as they choose. place
before thy [[eyes]] this facility with which the [[reason]] will be carried
through all things, as [[fire]] upwards, as a stone downwards, as a cylinder
down an inclined surface, and seek for nothing further. for all other
obstacles either affect the [[body]] only which is a [[dead]] thing; or, except
through [[opinion]] and the yielding of the [[reason]] itself, they do not
crush nor do any harm of any [[kind]]; for if they did, he who [[felt]] it
would immediately become [[bad]]. now, in the case of all things which
have a [[certain]] [[constitution]], whatever harm may happen to any of them,
that which is so affected becomes consequently worse; but in the like
case, a [[man]] becomes both [[better]], if one may say so, and more worthy
of [[praise]] by making a [[right]] use of these accidents. and finally remember
that nothing harms him who is really a citizen, which does not harm
the [[state]]; nor yet does anything harm the [[state]], which does not harm
law (order); and of these things which are called misfortunes not
one harms [[law]]. what then does not harm [[law]] does not harm either state
or citizen. 

to him who is penetrated by true principles [[principle]] even the briefest precept
is sufficient, and any [[common]] precept, to remind him that he should
be [[free]] from [[grief]] and [[fear]]. for example- 

leaves, some the wind scatters on the ground- 
so is the [[race]] of [[men]]. leaves, also, are thy [[children]]; and leaves,
too, are they who cry out as if they were worthy of credit and bestow
their [[praise]], or on the contrary curse, or secretly blame and sneer;
and leaves, in like manner, are those who shall receive and transmit
a man's [[man]] fame to aftertimes. for all such things as these "are produced
in the season of spring," as the poet says; then the wind casts them
down; then the forest produces [[produce]] other leaves in their places. but a
brief existence is [[common]] to all things, and yet thou avoidest and
pursuest all things as if they would be eternal. a little [[time]], and
thou shalt close thy [[eyes]]; and him who has attended thee to thy grave
another soon will lament. 

the healthy eye ought to see all visible things and not to say, i
wish for green things; for this is the condition of a diseased eye.
and the healthy hearing and smelling ought to be ready to perceive
all that can be heard and smelled. and the healthy stomach ought to
be with [[respect]] to all food just as the mill with [[respect]] to all things
which it is formed to grind. and accordingly the healthy understanding
ought to be prepared for everything which happens; but that which
says, let my dear [[children]] [[live]], and let all [[men]] [[praise]] whatever i
may do, is an eye which seeks for green things, or teeth which seek
for soft things. 

there is no [[man]] so fortunate that there shall not be by him when he
is dying some who are pleased with what is going to happen. suppose
that he was a [[good]] and [[wise]] [[man]], will there not be at [[last]] some one
to say to himself, let us at [[last]] breathe freely being relieved from
this schoolmaster? it is true that he was harsh to none of us, but
i perceived that he tacitly condemns us.- this is what is said of
a [[good]] [[man]]. but in our own case how many other things are there for
which there are many who [[wish]] to get rid of us. thou wilt consider
this then when thou art [[arts]] dying, and thou wilt depart more contentedly
by reflecting thus: i am going away from such a [[life]], in which even
my associates in behalf of whom i have striven so much, prayed, and
cared, themselves [[wish]] me to depart, hoping perchance to get some
little advantage by it. why then should a [[man]] cling to a longer stay
here? do not however for this [[reason]] go away less kindly disposed
to them, but preserving thy own [[character]], and friendly and benevolent
and mild, and on the other hand not as if thou wast torn away; but
as when a [[man]] dies a quiet [[death]], the [[poor]] [[soul]] is easily separated
from the [[body]], such also ought thy departure from [[men]] to be, for nature
united thee to them and associated thee. but does she now dissolve
the union? well, i am separated as from kinsmen, not however dragged
resisting, but without compulsion; for this too is one of the things
according to [[nature]]. 

accustom thyself as much as possible on the [[occasion]] of anything being
done by any [[person]] to inquire with thyself, for what object is this
man doing this? but begin with thyself, and examine thyself first.

remember that this which pulls the strings is the thing which is hidden
within: this is the [[power]] of persuasion, this is [[life]], this, if one
may so say, is [[man]]. in contemplating thyself never include the vessel
which surrounds thee and these instruments which are attached about
it. for they are like to an axe, differing only in this that they
grow to the [[body]]. for indeed there is no more use in these parts without
the cause which moves and checks them than in the weaver's shuttle,
and the writer's pen and the driver's whip.

book eleven

these are the properties [[property]] of the [[rational]] [[soul]]: it sees itself, analyses
itself, and makes itself such as it chooses; the fruit which it bears
itself enjoys- for the fruits of plants and that in animals which
corresponds to fruits others enjoy- it obtains its own end, wherever
the limit of [[life]] may be fixed. not as in a dance and in a play and
in such like things, where the whole action is incomplete, if anything
cuts it short; but in every part and wherever it may be stopped, it
makes what has been set before it full and complete, so that it can
say, i have what is my own. and further it traverses the whole [[universe]],
and the surrounding vacuum, and surveys its form, and it extends itself
into the infinity of [[time]], and embraces and comprehends the periodical
renovation of all things, and it comprehends that those who come after
us will see nothing new, nor have those before us seen anything more,
but in a manner he who is forty years old, if he has any understanding
at all, has seen by [[virtue]] of the uniformity that prevails all things
which have been and all that will be. this too is a [[property]] of the
rational [[soul]], [[love]] of one's neighbour, and [[truth]] and modesty, and
to value nothing more more than itself, which is also the property
of [[law]]. thus then [[right]] [[reason]] differs not at all from the reason
of [[justice]]. 

thou wilt set little value on pleasing [[song]] and dancing and the pancratium,
if thou wilt distribute the melody of the voice into its several sounds,
and ask thyself as to each, if thou art [[arts]] mastered by this; for thou
wilt be prevented by shame from confessing it: and in the matter of
dancing, if at each movement and attitude thou wilt do the same; and
the like also in the matter of the pancratium. in all things, then,
except [[virtue]] and the acts of [[virtue]], [[remember]] to apply thyself to
their several parts, and by this division to come to value them little:
and apply this [[rule]] also to thy whole [[life]]. 

what a [[soul]] that is which is ready, if at any moment it must be separated
from the [[body]], and ready either to be extinguished or dispersed or
continue to [[exist]]; but so that this readiness comes from a man's [[man]] own
judgement, not from mere obstinacy, as with the christians [[christian]], but considerately
and with [[dignity]] and in a way to persuade another, without tragic
show. 

have i done something for the general interest? well then i have had
my [[reward]]. let this always be [[present]] to thy [[mind]], and never stop
doing such [[good]]. 

what is thy art [[arts]]? to be [[good]]. and how is this accomplished well except
by general principles [[principle]], some about the [[nature]] of the [[universe]], and
others about the proper [[constitution]] of [[man]]? 

at first tragedies were brought on the stage as means of reminding
men of the things which happen to them, and that it is according to
nature for things to happen so, and that, if you are delighted with
what is shown on the stage, you should not be troubled with that which
takes place on the larger stage. for you see that these things must
be accomplished thus, and that even they bear them who cry out "o
cithaeron." and, indeed, some things are said well by the dramatic
writers, of which [[kind]] is the following especially:- 

me and my [[children]] if the gods neglect, 
this has its [[reason]] too. and again- 

we must not chale and fret at that which happens. and 

life's harvest reap like the wheat's fruitful ear. and other things
of the same [[kind]]. 

after tragedy the old comedy was introduced, which had a magisterial
freedom of [[speech]], and by its very plainness of speaking was useful
in reminding [[men]] to beware of insolence; and for this [[purpose]] too
diogenes used to take from these writers. 

but as to the middle comedy which came next, observe what it was,
and again, for what object the new comedy was introduced, which gradually
sunk down into a mere mimic artifice. that some [[good]] things are said
even by these writers, everybody knows [[know]]: but the whole plan of such
poetry and dramaturgy, to what end does it look! 

how plain does it appear that there is not another condition of life
so well suited for philosophising as this in which thou now happenest
to be. 

a branch cut off from the adjacent branch must of necessity be cut
off from the whole tree also. so too a [[man]] when he is separated from
another [[man]] has fallen off from the whole social [[community]]. now as
to a branch, another cuts it off, but a [[man]] by his own act separates
himself from his neighbour when he hates him and turns away from him,
and he does not [[know]] that he has at the same [[time]] cut himself off
from the whole social [[system]]. yet he has this [[privilege]] certainly
from [[zeus]] who framed [[society]], for it is in our [[power]] to grow again
to that which is near to us, and be to come a part which helps to
make up the whole. however, if it often happens, this [[kind]] of separation,
it makes it difficult for that which detaches itself to be brought
to unity and to be restored to its former condition. finally, the
branch, which from the first grew together with the tree, and has
continued to have one [[life]] with it, is not like that which after being
cut off is then ingrafted, for this is something like what the gardeners
mean when they say that it grows with the rest of the tree, but that
it has not the same [[mind]] with it. 

as those who try to stand in thy way when thou art [[arts]] proceeding according
to [[right]] [[reason]], will not be able to turn thee aside from thy proper
action, so neither let them drive thee from thy benevolent feelings
towards them, but be on thy guard equally in both matters, not only
in the matter of steady judgement and action, but also in the matter
of gentleness towards those who try to hinder or otherwise trouble
thee. for this also is a weakness, to be vexed at them, as well as
to be diverted from thy course of action and to give way through [[fear]];
for both are equally deserters from their post, the [[man]] who does it
through [[fear]], and the [[man]] who is alienated from him who is by nature
a kinsman and a friend. 

there is no [[nature]] which is inferior to art [[arts]], for the [[arts]] imitate
the [[nature]] of things. but if this is so, that [[nature]] which is the
most [[perfect]] and the most comprehensive of all natures [[nature]], cannot fall
short of the [[skill]] of art [[arts]]. now all [[arts]] do the inferior things for
the sake of the superior; therefore the universal [[nature]] does so too.
and, indeed, hence is the origin of [[justice]], and in [[justice]] the other
virtues have their foundation: for [[justice]] will not be observed, if
we either [[care]] for middle things (things indifferent), or are easily
deceived and careless and changeable. 

if the things do not come to thee, the pursuits and avoidances of
which disturb thee, still in a manner thou goest to them. let then
thy judgement about them be at rest, and they will remain quiet, and
thou wilt not be seen either pursuing or avoiding. 

the spherical form of the [[soul]] maintains its figure, when it is neither
extended towards any object, nor contracted inwards, nor dispersed
nor sinks down, but is illuminated by [[light]], by which it sees the
truth, the [[truth]] of all things and the [[truth]] that is in itself.

suppose any [[man]] shall despise me. let him look to that himself. but
i will look to this, that i be not discovered doing or saying anything
deserving of contempt. shall any [[man]] hate me? let him look to it.
but i will be mild and benevolent towards every [[man]], and ready to
show even him his mistake, not reproachfully, nor yet as making a
display of my endurance, but nobly and honestly, like the [[great]] phocion,
unless indeed he only assumed it. for the interior parts ought to
be such, and a [[man]] ought to be seen by the gods neither dissatisfied
with anything nor complaining. for what [[evil]] is it to thee, if thou
art now doing what is agreeable to thy own [[nature]], and art [[arts]] satisfied
with that which at this moment is suitable to the [[nature]] of the [[universe]],
since thou art [[arts]] a [[human]] being placed at thy post in order that what
is for the [[common]] advantage may be done in some way? 

men despise one another and flatter one another; and [[men]] [[wish]] to raise
themselves above one another, and crouch before one another.

how unsound and insincere is he who says, i have determined to deal
with thee in a [[fair]] way.- what art [[arts]] thou doing, [[man]]? there is no occasion
to give this notice. it will soon show itself by acts. the voice ought
to be plainly written on the forehead. such as a man's [[man]] [[character]] is,
he immediately shows it in his [[eyes]], just as he who is beloved forthwith
reads everything in the [[eyes]] of lovers. the [[man]] who is honest and
good ought to be exactly like a [[man]] who smells [[strong]], so that the
bystander as soon as he comes near him must smell whether he choose
or not. but the affectation of simplicity is like a crooked stick.
nothing is more disgraceful than a wolfish [[friendship]] (false friendship).
avoid this most of all. the [[good]] and simple and benevolent show all
these things in the [[eyes]], and there is no mistaking. 

as to living in the [[best]] way, this [[power]] is in the [[soul]], if it be
indifferent to things which are indifferent. and it will be indifferent,
if it looks on each of these things separately and all together, and
if it remembers that not one of them produces [[produce]] in us an [[opinion]] about
itself, nor comes to us; but these things remain immovable, and it
is we ourselves who [[produce]] the judgements about them, and, as we
may say, write them in ourselves, it being in our [[power]] not to write
them, and it being in our [[power]], if perchance these judgements have
imperceptibly got admission to our minds [[mind]], to wipe them out; and if
we [[remember]] also that such attention will only be for a short [[time]],
and then [[life]] will be at an end. besides, what trouble is there at
all in doing this? for if these things are according to [[nature]], rejoice
in them, and they will be easy to thee: but if contrary to [[nature]],
seek what is conformable to thy own [[nature]], and strive towards this,
even if it bring no [[reputation]]; for every [[man]] is allowed to seek his
own [[good]]. 

consider whence each thing is come, and of what it consists, and into
what it changes [[change]], and what [[kind]] of a thing it will be when it has changed,
and that it will sustain no harm. 

if any have offended against thee, consider first: what is my relation
to [[men]], and that we are made for one another; and in another [[respect]],
i was made to be set over them, as a ram over the flock or a bull
over the herd. but examine the matter from first principles [[principle]], from
this: if all things are not mere atoms, it is [[nature]] which orders
all things: if this is so, the inferior things [[exist]] for the sake
of the superior, and these for the sake of one another. 

second, consider what [[kind]] of [[men]] they are at table, in bed, and so
forth: and particularly, under what compulsions in [[respect]] of opinions
they are; and as to their acts, consider with what [[pride]] they do what
they do. 

third, that if [[men]] do rightly what they do, we ought not to be displeased;
but if they do not [[right]], it is plain that they do so involuntarily
and in ignorance. for as every [[soul]] is unwillingly deprived of the
truth, so also is it unwillingly deprived of the [[power]] of behaving
to each [[man]] according to his deserts. accordingly [[men]] are pained when
they are called [[unjust]], ungrateful, and greedy, and in a word wrong-doers
to their neighbours. 

fourth, consider that thou also doest many things [[wrong]], and that
thou art [[arts]] a [[man]] like others; and even if thou dost abstain from certain
faults, still thou hast the disposition to commit them, though either
through cowardice, or concern about [[reputation]], or some such mean
motive, thou dost abstain from such faults [[fault]]. 

fifth, consider that thou dost not even [[understand]] whether [[men]] are
doing [[wrong]] or not, for many things are done with a [[certain]] reference
to circumstances. and in short, a [[man]] must learn a [[great]] deal to enable
him to pass a [[correct]] judgement on another man's [[man]] acts. 

sixth, consider when thou art [[arts]] much vexed or [[grieved]], that man's [[man]] life
is only a moment, and after a short [[time]] we are all laid out [[dead]].

seventh, that it is not men's acts which disturb us, for those acts
have their foundation in men's ruling principles [[principle]], but it is our own
opinions which disturb us. take away these opinions [[opinion]] then, and resolve
to dismiss thy judgement about an act as if it were something grievous,
and thy anger is gone. how then shall i take away these opinions [[opinion]]?
by reflecting that no wrongful act of another brings shame on thee:
for unless that which is shameful is alone [[bad]], thou also must of
necessity do many things [[wrong]], and become a robber and everything
else. 

eighth, consider how much more [[pain]] is brought on us by the anger
and vexation caused by such acts than by the acts themselves, at which
we are angry and vexed. 

ninth, consider that a [[good]] disposition is invincible, if it be [[genuine]],
and not an affected smile and acting a part. for what will the most
violent [[man]] do to thee, if thou continuest to be of a [[kind]] disposition
towards him, and if, as opportunity offers, thou gently admonishest
him and calmly correctest his errors at the very [[time]] when he is trying
to do thee harm, saying, not so, my child: we are constituted by nature
for something else: i shall certainly not be injured, but thou art
injuring thyself, my child.- and show him with gentle tact and by
general principles [[principle]] that this is so, and that even bees do not do as
he does, nor any animals which are formed by [[nature]] to be gregarious.
and thou must do this neither with any double meaning nor in the way
of reproach, but affectionately and without any rancour in thy [[soul]];
and not as if thou wert lecturing him, nor yet that any bystander
may [[admire]], but either when he is alone, and if others are [[present]]...

remember these nine rules [[rule]], as if thou hadst received them as a gift
from the muses, and begin at [[last]] to be a [[man]] while thou livest. but
thou must equally avoid flattering [[men]] and being veied at them, for
both are unsocial and lead to harm. and let this [[truth]] be present
to thee in the excitement of anger, that to be moved by passion is
not manly, but that mildness and gentleness, as they are more agreeable
to [[human]] [[nature]], so also are they more manly; and he who possesses
these qualities possesses [[strength]], nerves and [[courage]], and not the
man who is [[subject]] to fits of passion and discontent. for in the same
degree in which a man's [[man]] [[mind]] is nearer to [[freedom]] from all passion,
in the same [[degree]] also is it nearer to [[strength]]: and as the sense
of [[pain]] is a characteristic of weakness, so also is anger. for he
who yields to [[pain]] and he who yields to anger, both are wounded and
both submit. 

but if thou wilt, receive also a tenth [[present]] from the leader of
the muses (apollo), and it is this- that to expect [[bad]] [[men]] not to
do [[wrong]] is madness, for he who expects this desires [[desire]] an impossibility.
but to allow [[men]] to behave so to others, and to expect them not to
do thee any [[wrong]], is irrational and [[tyrannical]]. 

there are four principal aberrations of the superior faculty against
which thou shouldst be constantly on thy guard, and when thou hast
detected them, thou shouldst wipe them out and say on each occasion
thus: this [[thought]] is not necessary: this tends to [[destroy]] social
union: this which thou art [[arts]] going to say comes not from the real thoughts [[thought]];
for thou shouldst consider it among the most absurd of things for
a [[man]] not to speak from his real thoughts [[thought]]. but the fourth is when
thou shalt reproach thyself for anything, for this is an evidence
of the diviner part within thee being overpowered and yielding to
the less honourable and to the perishable part, the [[body]], and to its
gross pleasures [[pleasure]]. 

thy aerial part and all the fiery parts which are mingled in thee,
though by [[nature]] they have an upward tendency, still in obedience
to the disposition of the [[universe]] they are overpowered here in the
compound mass (the body). and also the whole of the earthy part in
thee and the watery, though their tendency is downward, still are
raised up and occupy a position which is not their [[natural]] one. in
this manner then the elemental parts obey the universal, for when
they have been fixed in any place perforce they remain there until
again the universal shall sound the signal for dissolution. is it
not then [[strange]] that thy [[intelligent]] part only should be disobedient
and discontented with its own place? and yet no [[force]] is imposed on
it, but only those things which are conformable to its [[nature]]: still
it does not submit, but is carried in the opposite direction. for
the movement towards [[injustice]] and intemperance and to anger and grief
and [[fear]] is nothing else than the act of one who deviates from [[nature]].
and also when the ruling faculty is discontented with anything that
happens, then too it deserts its post: for it is constituted for piety
and reverence towards the gods no less than for [[justice]]. for these
qualities also are comprehended under the generic term of contentment
with the [[constitution]] of things, and indeed they are prior to acts
of [[justice]]. 

he who has not one and always the same object in [[life]], cannot be one
and the same all through his [[life]]. but what i have said is not enough,
unless this also is added, what this object ought to be. for as there
is not the same [[opinion]] about all the things which in some way or
other are considered by the majority to be [[good]], but only about some
certain things, that is, things which concern the [[common]] interest;
so also ought we to propose to ourselves an object which shall be
of a [[common]] [[kind]] (social) and [[political]]. for he who directs all his
own efforts to this object, will make all his acts alike, and thus
will always be the same. 

think of the [[country]] mouse and of the town mouse, and of the alarm
and trepidation of the town mouse. 

socrates used to call the opinions [[opinion]] of the many by the name of lamiae,
bugbears to frighten [[children]]. 

the lacedaemonians at their [[public]] spectacles used to set seats in
the shade for strangers, but themselves sat down anywhere.

socrates excused himself to perdiccas for not going to him, saying,
it is because i would not perish by the worst of all ends, that is,
i would not receive a favour and then be unable to return it.

in the writings of the ephesians there was this precept, constantly
to [[think]] of some one of the [[men]] of former times [[time]] who practised [[virtue]].

the pythagoreans bid us in the morning look to the heavens [[heaven]] that we
may be reminded of those bodies [[body]] which continually do the same things
and in the same manner perform their [[work]], and also be reminded of
their purity and nudity. for there is no veil over a star.

consider what a [[man]] [[socrates]] was when he dressed himself in a skin,
after xanthippe had taken his cloak and gone out, and what socrates
said to his [[friends]] who were ashamed of him and drew back from him
when they saw him dressed thus. 

neither in writing nor in reading wilt thou be able to lay down rules
for others before thou shalt have first learned to obey rules [[rule]] thyself.
much more is this so in [[life]]. 

a [[slave]] thou art [[arts]]: [[free]] [[speech]] is not for thee. 
and my [[heart]] laughed within. 
and [[virtue]] they will curse, speaking harsh words. 
to look for the fig in winter is a madman's act: such is he who looks
for his child when it is no longer allowed. 

when a [[man]] kisses his child, said epictetus, he should whisper to
himself, "to-morrow perchance thou wilt [[die]]."- but those are words
of [[bad]] omen.- "no word is a word of [[bad]] omen," said epictetus, "which
expresses any [[work]] of [[nature]]; or if it is so, it is also a word of
bad omen to speak of the ears of corn being reaped." 

the unripe grape, the ripe bunch, the dried grape, all are changes [[change]],
not into nothing, but into something which exists not yet.

no [[man]] can rob us of our [[free]] will. 
epictetus also said, a [[man]] must discover an art [[arts]] (or rules) with respect
to giving his assent; and in [[respect]] to his movements he must be careful
that they be made with regard to circumstances, that they be consistent
with social interests, that they have regard to the value of the object;
and as to sensual [[desire]], he should altogether keep away from it;
and as to avoidance (aversion) he should not show it with respect
to any of the things which are not in our [[power]]. 

the dispute then, he said, is not about any [[common]] matter, but about
being mad or not. 

socrates used to say, what do you want? souls [[soul]] of [[rational]] [[men]] or irrational?-
souls of [[rational]] [[men]].- of what [[rational]] [[men]]? sound or unsound?- sound.-
why then do you not seek for them?- because we have them.- why then
do you [[fight]] and quarrel? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book twelve

all those things at which thou wishest to arrive by a circuitous
road, thou canst have now, if thou dost not refuse them to thyself.
and this means, if thou wilt take no notice of all the [[past]], and trust
the future to providence, and direct the [[present]] only conformably
to piety and [[justice]]. conformably to piety, that thou mayest be content
with the lot which is assigned to thee, for [[nature]] designed it for
thee and thee for it. conformably to [[justice]], that thou mayest always
speak the [[truth]] freely and without [[disguise]], and do the things which
are agreeable to [[law]] and according to the worth of each. and let neither
another man's [[man]] wickedness hinder thee, nor [[opinion]] nor voice, nor yet
the sensations of the [[poor]] flesh which has grown about thee; for the
passive part will look to this. if then, whatever the [[time]] may be
when thou shalt be near to thy departure, neglecting everything else
thou shalt [[respect]] only thy ruling faculty and the divinity within
thee, and if thou shalt be afraid not because thou must some time
cease to [[live]], but if thou shalt [[fear]] never to have begun to live
according to nature- then thou wilt be a [[man]] worthy of the universe
which has produced thee, and thou wilt cease to be a stranger in thy
native [[land]], and to wonder at things which happen daily as if they
were something unexpected, and to be dependent on this or that.

god sees the minds [[mind]] (ruling principles) of all [[men]] bared of the material
vesture and rind and impurities. for with his intellectual part alone
he touches the [[intelligence]] only which has flowed and been derived
from himself into these bodies [[body]]. and if thou also usest thyself to
do this, thou wilt rid thyself of thy much trouble. for he who regards
not the [[poor]] flesh which envelops him, surely will not trouble himself
by looking after raiment and dwelling and fame and such like externals
and show. 

the things are three of which thou art [[arts]] composed, a little [[body]], a
little breath (life), [[intelligence]]. of these the first two are thine,
so far as it is thy [[duty]] to take [[care]] of them; but the third alone
is properly thine. therefore if thou shalt separate from thyself,
that is, from thy understanding, whatever others do or say, and whatever
thou hast done or said thyself, and whatever future things trouble
thee because they may happen, and whatever in the [[body]] which envelops
thee or in the breath (life), which is by [[nature]] associated with the
body, is attached to thee independent of thy will, and whatever the
external circumfluent vortex whirls round, so that the intellectual
power exempt from the things of [[fate]] can [[live]] pure and [[free]] by itself,
doing what is just and accepting what happens and saying the [[truth]]:
if thou wilt separate, i say, from this ruling faculty the things
which are attached to it by the impressions of sense, and the things
of [[time]] to come and of [[time]] that is [[past]], and wilt make thyself like
empedocles' sphere, 

all round, and in its joyous rest reposing; and if thou shalt strive
to [[live]] only what is really thy [[life]], that is, the present- then thou
wilt be able to pass that portion of [[life]] which remains for thee up
to the [[time]] of thy [[death]], [[free]] from perturbations, nobly, and obedient
to thy own daemon (to the [[god]] that is within thee). 

i have often wondered how it is that every [[man]] loves [[love]] himself more
than all the rest of [[men]], but yet sets less value on his own opinion
of himself than on the [[opinion]] of others. if then a [[god]] or a wise
teacher should [[present]] himself to a [[man]] and bid him to [[think]] of nothing
and to design nothing which he would not express as soon as he conceived
it, he could not endure it even for a [[single]] day. so much more respect
have we to what our neighbours shall [[think]] of us than to what we shall
think of ourselves. 

how can it be that the gods after having arranged all things well
and benevolently for [[mankind]], have overlooked this alone, that some
men and very [[good]] [[men]], and [[men]] who, as we may say, have had most communion
with the divinity, and through pious acts and [[religious]] observances
have been most intimate with the divinity, when they have once died
should never [[exist]] again, but should be completely extinguished?

but if this is so, be assured that if it ought to have been otherwise,
the gods would have done it. for if it were just, it would also be
possible; and if it were according to [[nature]], [[nature]] would have had
it so. but because it is not so, if in [[fact]] it is not so, be thou
convinced that it ought not to have been so:- for thou seest even
of thyself that in this inquiry thou art [[arts]] disputing with the diety;
and we should not thus dispute with the gods, unless they were most
excellent and most just;- but if this is so, they would not have allowed
anything in the ordering of the [[universe]] to be neglected unjustly
and irrationally. 

practise thyself even in the things which thou despairest of accomplishing.
for even the left hand, which is ineffectual for all other things
for want of practice, holds the bridle more vigorously than the right
hand; for it has been practised in this. 

consider in what condition both in [[body]] and [[soul]] a [[man]] should be when
he is overtaken by [[death]]; and consider the shortness of [[life]], the
boundless abyss of [[time]] [[past]] and future, the feebleness of all matter.

contemplate the formative principles [[principle]] (forms) of things bare of their
coverings; the purposes [[purpose]] of actions; consider what [[pain]] is, what pleasure
is, and [[death]], and fame; who is to himself the cause of his uneasiness;
how no [[man]] is hindered by another; that everything is [[opinion]].

in the application of thy principles [[principle]] thou must be like the pancratiast,
not like the gladiator; for the gladiator lets fall the [[sword]] which
he uses and is killed; but the other always has his hand, and needs
to do nothing else than use it. 

see what things are in themselves, dividing them into matter, form
and [[purpose]]. 

what a [[power]] [[man]] has to do nothing except what [[god]] will approve, and
to accept all that [[god]] may give him. 

with [[respect]] to that which happens conformably to [[nature]], we ought
to blame neither gods, for they do nothing [[wrong]] either voluntarily
or involuntarily, nor [[men]], for they do nothing [[wrong]] except involuntarily.
consequently we should blame nobody. 

how ridiculous and what a stranger he is who is surprised at anything
which happens in [[life]]. 

either there is a fatal necessity and invincible order, or a kind
providence, or a confusion without a [[purpose]] and without a director
(book iv). if then there is an invincible necessity, why dost thou
resist? but if there is a providence which allows itself to be propitiated,
make thyself worthy of the [[help]] of the divinity. but if there is a
confusion without governor, be content that in such a tempest thou
hast in thyself a [[certain]] ruling [[intelligence]]. and even if the tempest
carry thee away, let it carry away the [[poor]] flesh, the [[poor]] breath,
everything else; for the [[intelligence]] at least it will not carry away.

does the [[light]] of the lamp shine without losing its splendour until
it is extinguished; and shall the [[truth]] which is in thee and justice
and temperance be extinguished before thy [[death]]? 

when a [[man]] has presented the appearance of having done [[wrong]], say,
how then do i [[know]] if this is a wrongful act? and even if he has done
wrong, how do i [[know]] that he has not condemned himself? and so this
is like tearing his own face. consider that he, who would not have
the [[bad]] [[man]] do [[wrong]], is like the [[man]] who would not have the fig-tree
to bear juice in the figs and infants to cry and the horse to neigh,
and whatever else must of necessity be. for what must a [[man]] do who
has such a [[character]]? if then thou art [[arts]] irritable, cure this man's
disposition. 

if it is not [[right]], do not do it: if it is not true, do not say it.
for let thy efforts be- 

in everything always observe what the thing is which produces [[produce]] for
thee an appearance, and resolve it by dividing it into the formal,
the material, the [[purpose]], and the [[time]] within which it must end.

perceive at [[last]] that thou hast in thee something [[better]] and more
divine than the things which cause the various affects, and as it
were pull thee by the strings. what is there now in my [[mind]]? is it
fear, or suspicion, or [[desire]], or anything of the [[kind]]? 

first, do nothing inconsiderately, nor without a [[purpose]]. second,
make thy acts refer to nothing else than to a social end.

consider that before long thou wilt be nobody and nowhere, nor will
any of the things [[exist]] which thou now seest, nor any of those who
are now living. for all things are formed by [[nature]] to [[change]] and
be turned and to perish in order that other things in continuous succession
may [[exist]]. 

consider that everything is [[opinion]], and [[opinion]] is in thy [[power]].
take away then, when thou choosest, thy [[opinion]], and like a mariner,
who has doubled the promontory, thou wilt find calm, everything stable,
and a waveless bay. 

any one activity whatever it may be, when it has ceased at its proper
time, suffers no [[evil]] because it has ceased; nor he who has done this
act, does he suffer any [[evil]] for this [[reason]] that the act has ceased.
in like manner then the whole which consists of all the acts, which
is our [[life]], if it cease at its proper [[time]], suffers no [[evil]] for this
reason that it has ceased; nor he who has terminated this series at
the proper [[time]], has he been ill dealt with. but the proper [[time]] and
the limit [[nature]] fixes, sometimes as in old [[age]] the peculiar nature
of [[man]], but always the universal [[nature]], by the [[change]] of whose parts
the whole [[universe]] continues ever [[young]] and [[perfect]]. and everything
which is useful to the universal is always [[good]] and in season. therefore
the termination of [[life]] for every [[man]] is no [[evil]], because neither
is it shameful, since it is both independent of the will and not opposed
to the general interest, but it is [[good]], since it is seasonable and
profitable to and congruent with the universal. for thus too he is
moved by the deity who is moved in the same manner with the deity
and moved towards the same things in his [[mind]]. 

these three principles [[principle]] thou must have in readiness. in the things
which thou doest do nothing either inconsiderately or otherwise than
as [[justice]] herself would act; but with [[respect]] to what may happen
to thee from without, consider that it happens either by [[chance]] or
according to providence, and thou must neither blame [[chance]] nor accuse
providence. second, consider what every being is from the seed to
the [[time]] of its receiving a [[soul]], and from the reception of a soul
to the giving back of the same, and of what things every being is
compounded and into what things it is resolved. third, if thou shouldst
suddenly be raised up above the [[earth]], and shouldst look down on human
things, and observe the variety of them how [[great]] it is, and at the
same [[time]] also shouldst see at a glance how [[great]] is the number of
beings who dwell around in the air and the aether, consider that as
often as thou shouldst be raised up, thou wouldst see the same things,
sameness of form and shortness of duration. are these things to be
proud of? 

cast away [[opinion]]: thou art [[arts]] saved. who then hinders thee from casting
it away? 

when thou art [[arts]] troubled about anything, thou hast forgotten this, that
all things happen according to the universal [[nature]]; and forgotten
this, that a man's [[man]] wrongful act is nothing to thee; and further thou
hast forgotten this, that everything which happens, always happened
so and will happen so, and now happens so everywhere; forgotten this
too, how close is the kinship between a [[man]] and the whole [[human]] [[race]],
for it is a [[community]], not of a little [[blood]] or seed, but of [[intelligence]].
and thou hast forgotten this too, that every man's [[man]] [[intelligence]] is
a [[god]], and is an efflux of the deity; and forgotten this, that nothing
is a man's [[man]] own, but that his child and his [[body]] and his very soul
came from the deity; forgotten this, that everything is [[opinion]]; and
lastly thou hast forgotten that every [[man]] lives [[life]] the [[present]] [[time]] only,
and loses only this. 

constantly bring to thy recollection those who have complained greatly
about anything, those who have been most conspicuous by the greatest
fame or misfortunes or enmities or fortunes [[fortune]] of any [[kind]]: then think
where are they all now? smoke and ash and a tale, or not even a tale.
and let there be [[present]] to thy [[mind]] also everything of this sort,
how fabius catullinus lived in the [[country]], and lucius lupus in his
gardens, and stertinius at baiae, and tiberius at capreae and velius
rufus (or rufus at velia); and in fine [[think]] of the eager pursuit
of anything conjoined with [[pride]]; and how worthless everything is
after which [[men]] violently strain; and how much more philosophical
it is for a [[man]] in the opportunities presented to him to show

the end
